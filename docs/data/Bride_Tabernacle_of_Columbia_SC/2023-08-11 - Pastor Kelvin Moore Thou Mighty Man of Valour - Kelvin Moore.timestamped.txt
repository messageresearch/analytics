[41:22] Amazing Grace
[41:24] amen you can be seated just for a moment
[41:26] it's just good to be in the house of the
[41:29] Lord
[41:30] good to see you all amen it's
[41:33] hasn't been that long since I've been
[41:34] here but thanking God that He gave us an
[41:37] opportunity to come back
[41:39] and uh
[41:41] as a brother
[41:42] Henry was saying my wife and I was up in
[41:45] Charlotte and my son and his family
[41:48] and I think when I was here before I was
[41:51] talking about my granddaughter who was
[41:53] soon to come
[41:55] or she's eight months old now and so
[41:58] I refuse to be an absentee grandfather
[42:03] so they probably gonna see me more than
[42:05] what they might want to but I have a
[42:08] reason to go there
[42:10] every time I go there it's only an hour
[42:12] and a half to Colombia so
[42:15] I've been getting in some fellowship and
[42:17] uh
[42:18] spending time see I believe
[42:21] that as a
[42:22] Christian
[42:24] grandfather
[42:25] I need to have my hands on my grandchild
[42:29] I need to be able to pour something into
[42:32] her
[42:34] and if I don't do that then how can I
[42:37] really be demonstrating that I'm
[42:38] concerned how can I really be
[42:41] demonstrating what the love of God is
[42:43] see God is a family man
[42:46] he is concerned and so I'm concerned and
[42:48] I will be there
[42:51] and so I've been getting around doing a
[42:54] lot of visiting because I'm going to go
[42:56] see my granddaughter so tonight I just
[42:58] thank the Lord there was a song that was
[43:01] um
[43:02] requested and I tell you it's been a
[43:04] minute since I sang that song matter of
[43:06] fact probably the last time I sang it
[43:08] was here
[43:09] um so I might excuse me I might need a
[43:13] sip of this to try to help me do it amen
[43:15] how many know that when we are in Christ
[43:19] if our mind is not made up
[43:23] it's not a good place to be
[43:28] because the Bible it lets me know very
[43:30] plainly that a double-minded man
[43:34] is unstable and not some of his ways but
[43:37] it said in all of his ways
[43:41] all is inclusive it doesn't leave
[43:43] anything out so you might think that
[43:45] well I can be shaky in Christ but I'm
[43:48] solid on my job now you're fooling
[43:50] yourself
[43:52] because you're unstable in all of your
[43:54] ways if your mind is not made up
[43:59] and I just believe that because that's
[44:01] what the word said all right
[44:03] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[44:06] of his ways and it said let him think
[44:09] not that he receiveth anything
[44:12] from the Lord
[44:14] whoo
[44:16] I don't think somebody believed that's
[44:18] in there bro
[44:21] but it's in there
[44:23] and so I don't want to be shaky when it
[44:26] comes to my faith
[44:30] I wouldn't want my wife to be shaky
[44:32] concerning my love that I have for her
[44:36] same relationship
[44:38] one is just natural the other one is
[44:41] spiritual
[44:42] I want the Lord to know that I love him
[44:46] because I know that he loved me why
[44:48] because he went to the cross
[44:51] and died in my place
[44:54] he who knew no sin became sin
[45:00] and and there is no greater love that a
[45:03] man could give than that he would lay
[45:04] down his life
[45:07] so he already did his part he showed us
[45:10] how much he loved us
[45:12] and now when we have opportunities like
[45:14] this to come together to lift him up we
[45:16] shouldn't hold back on our praise
[45:19] right we should not deny him any of the
[45:22] gifts that you have
[45:24] [Music]
[45:26] all

[50:36] looking forward to somebody else
[50:37] speaking tonight that's all right the
[50:39] Holy Ghost is going to speak
[50:41] amen I don't think we had a flyer saying
[50:45] who was going to be here
[50:46] but the Holy Ghost is here
[50:49] because the Lord promised that where two
[50:51] or three are gathered in his name that
[50:53] he would be in the midst and that is who
[50:56] we come to praise tonight
[50:58] amen we came to praise
[51:01] the name of Jesus Amen
[51:03] let's bow our heads before we read the
[51:06] word amen I'm already blessed
[51:09] and just having an opportunity father
[51:12] Lord we come one more time
[51:15] Lord so humbly
[51:17] and reverently before the throne of

[51:31] Lord and now may we give all that we
[51:34] have unto you
[51:35] Lord for this a lot of time
[51:38] Lord for you gave it all for us
[51:41] back on calvary's Cross
[51:43] Lord and us being here tonight is just a
[51:46] reasonable service
[51:50] you didn't ask us to do anything
[51:52] Supernatural or but to come
[51:55] and not to forsake the assembling of
[51:57] ourselves together in the house of the
[52:01] Lord
[52:02] so we are here tonight
[52:04] and we come to lift up your name for you
[52:07] said if you be lifted up you would draw
[52:09] all men unto yourself
[52:13] so we lift you up tonight
[52:15] may you be glorified and we pray that
[52:18] the people of God will be edified by the
[52:22] preaching of the word this is our prayer
[52:25] in Jesus name amen God bless you will
[52:28] you turn with me to the Book of Judges
[52:30] chapter 6.
[52:35] and God bless you musicians we thank you
[52:41] good to see you brother Jeremiah and
[52:43] other ministers brother legit
[52:45] amen I believe his brother Carl amen
[52:49] good to see him amen
[52:55] thank the Lord for pastor Simmons
[52:57] extending an invitation
[52:59] once again for us to be here amen
[53:04] I don't know about you but once upon a
[53:06] time on a Friday night
[53:09] all right Church might have been the
[53:10] furthest thing from my mind
[53:15] I'm old now but I still remember when my
[53:19] priorities were not what they are now
[53:23] and so I can't look down on anybody who
[53:26] does not have that same priority but if
[53:28] you saw fit to come why don't we get
[53:30] something out of it amen
[53:33] and we're only going to get out what we
[53:35] put in amen
[53:36] so judges six and let's uh we're going
[53:40] to read the first five verses and then
[53:41] we'll allow you to have your seat
[53:45] and the Bible says and the children of
[53:49] Israel
[53:50] did evil in the sight of the Lord
[53:55] and the Lord delivered them into the
[53:58] hands of Midian
[54:01] seven years
[54:03] and the Hand of Midian prevailed against
[54:06] Israel
[54:07] and because of the midianites the
[54:11] children of Israel made them the dens
[54:15] which are in the mountains and caves
[54:20] and strongholds strong holes from the
[54:24] enemy
[54:28] and so it was when Israel had sown
[54:32] that the midianites came up and the
[54:36] amalekites and the children of the east
[54:38] east even they came up against them
[54:42] and they encamped against them and
[54:45] destroyed the increase of the Earth
[54:49] till Thou come unto Gaza
[54:52] and left no sustenance for Israel
[54:57] neither sheep nor Ox nor ass for they
[55:02] came up with their cattle and their
[55:05] tents and they came as grasshoppers for
[55:09] multitude
[55:10] for both they and their camels were
[55:13] without number and they entered into the
[55:17] land to destroy it
[55:21] father may you add a blessing we pray to
[55:23] the word that has been read
[55:24] and that blessing that we desire tonight
[55:27] is that you will give us understanding
[55:29] according to your word for we pray this
[55:31] in Jesus name amen you can be seated
[55:38] the scripture may be familiar to many
[55:42] um
[55:44] you know but I just see so many
[55:47] parallels when I read this particular
[55:51] passage of scripture with the children
[55:53] of Israel being the chosen the elect of
[55:57] God
[56:01] chosen for a purpose but yet the enemy
[56:07] was on that trail
[56:10] so much so that they began to hide
[56:14] themselves and fortify themselves in
[56:18] caves and strongholds
[56:21] now in their mind it was a stronghold
[56:24] from the enemy
[56:26] but I'm here to show you that
[56:29] at some point in time it became a
[56:33] stronghold of the enemy
[56:38] see we think sometimes that we can hide
[56:42] and fortify ourselves from our situation
[56:45] when many times what we got to do is
[56:48] face it
[56:52] see we are not ordained to run from the
[56:56] devil that's an old Pentecostal song we
[56:59] used to sing
[57:00] I beat the devil running and I'm so glad
[57:04] you shouldn't have been running in the
[57:06] first place you should run to Jesus
[57:12] hold your peace and let the Lord fight
[57:16] your battle
[57:18] so what they were looking at as a
[57:21] stronghold from the enemy became a
[57:24] stronghold of the enemy why because this
[57:26] didn't just happen one time
[57:29] it said every time they plant it they
[57:32] cultivated the field they took in a
[57:34] harvest that the midianites and the
[57:36] amalekites will come up and take it
[57:40] if that is not the nature of Satan then
[57:43] tell me what it is for the enemy come if
[57:45] not now the groups that I just
[57:48] identified are enemies
[57:52] our enemy is the adversary Satan the
[57:56] devil
[57:57] and the Bible says the enemy cometh not
[57:59] the thief come if not but for to still
[58:02] kill and to destroy
[58:06] that's the only reason why it comes
[58:09] amen he don't come to patch you on the
[58:11] back until you doing well
[58:14] he don't come to tell you that the Lord
[58:16] is with you he'll tell you just the
[58:18] opposite God ain't with you
[58:21] that's why every year we come up here
[58:23] and take everything you got
[58:25] so much that they left them no
[58:29] sustenance
[58:30] in other words no way to sustain
[58:33] themselves
[58:34] no crops
[58:36] no sheep
[58:38] nothing
[58:41] see depression and oppression is two
[58:45] different things
[58:46] right and oppressed people are oppressed
[58:50] by an outside force
[58:53] but when that outside force is pounding
[58:56] on you and you get withdrawn then you
[58:59] can suffer from depression that comes
[59:02] from within
[59:05] can't nobody make you depressed you
[59:07] allow a situation to come and bring
[59:09] about depression
[59:11] and depression is a spirit of the enemy
[59:16] and that's listen that spirit is strong
[59:19] and it's prevalent in the land today
[59:23] and let me let me show you how even the
[59:25] enemy has tapped in to to our awareness
[59:29] of it everywhere you go now you look
[59:31] you'll see Billboards talking about
[59:32] Mental Health
[59:36] everywhere you go and yes it is a
[59:38] reality that people struggle with mental
[59:41] health but listen some of these things
[59:42] become strongholds that we have built
[59:46] from the enemy
[59:48] rather than facing it
[59:52] let's let's skip down for a minute I'm
[59:54] going to get to something what I want to
[59:57] talk to you about tonight is thou Mighty
[1:00:01] Man of Valor
[1:00:06] and when he said thou Mighty Man of
[1:00:09] Valley ain't just talking about the
[1:00:10] brothers we are all mankind sister you
[1:00:13] talking to you too
[1:00:15] listen if if a lot of brothers would be
[1:00:18] honest
[1:00:19] sometimes our wives can be more
[1:00:21] spiritual than we are
[1:00:23] right especially if she's blessed enough
[1:00:25] hear what I'm saying if she is blessed
[1:00:29] enough to be home taking care of her
[1:00:32] children praying for you
[1:00:34] and you out rubbing shoulders with the
[1:00:37] world all day on the job
[1:00:39] they have a tendency to be more
[1:00:41] spiritual than we are because we're
[1:00:43] trying to figure out how listen here's
[1:00:45] what she's going to focus on what is
[1:00:48] very immediate the immediate needs of
[1:00:52] the family a good father is trying to
[1:00:54] look down the road well I know in two
[1:00:56] years that boy gonna be ready to go to
[1:00:58] college how are we going to pay for it
[1:01:02] the whole car we got ain't gonna last
[1:01:04] too long sooner or later I'm gonna have
[1:01:05] to go get in he's trying to figure out
[1:01:07] how you're going to pay for it he
[1:01:09] looking down the road but when she
[1:01:10] dealing with his immediate take that
[1:01:12] thing and get the oil change
[1:01:14] the light came on in my car
[1:01:17] she dealing with what is very immediate
[1:01:21] but if she had the benefit of being able
[1:01:23] to do that many times they are more
[1:01:25] spiritual than we are
[1:01:28] and you might not want to admit it but
[1:01:29] it's okay
[1:01:32] because it's just true
[1:01:35] I I spoke to
[1:01:38] um
[1:01:39] I was speaking to someone the other day
[1:01:41] oh just yesterday we were in the store
[1:01:43] and uh we were with a sister
[1:01:46] um
[1:01:47] who was visiting and fellowshipping with
[1:01:49] my wife and I told her you know when you
[1:01:51] even when you look back on the old
[1:01:53] church when you looked at the population
[1:01:55] in the church as it is indicative
[1:01:58] tonight there is far more women in here
[1:02:00] than men
[1:02:03] far more right
[1:02:07] what does that speak to why is that
[1:02:11] many times more spiritual more in tune
[1:02:13] right and we focus on something
[1:02:15] everything but what we should be focused
[1:02:17] on
[1:02:20] sometimes it wouldn't be much of a
[1:02:22] church if you want for the Sisters the
[1:02:24] prophet said that the success of his
[1:02:26] meetings was three or four little ladies
[1:02:28] that was back home praying for him he
[1:02:30] traveling all around the world preaching
[1:02:31] the gospel
[1:02:34] so sisters Your Role is so vital
[1:02:37] so important
[1:02:39] to the church to the the continuation of
[1:02:43] the church or never let nobody make you
[1:02:45] feel like you're unimportant
[1:02:48] I thank God for my wife
[1:02:52] when I used to work 12 and 14 hours a
[1:02:55] day six and seven days a week and come
[1:02:58] in and she would have an atmosphere set
[1:03:00] in the house
[1:03:03] and just wash all of that filth off of
[1:03:06] me
[1:03:07] wow because I came into an atmosphere
[1:03:10] that was a holy ghost-filled atmosphere
[1:03:14] what a blessing go down with me to verse
[1:03:17] 11.
[1:03:19] so I'm gonna I'm gonna read a little bit
[1:03:21] about a man named Gideon
[1:03:24] many stories could be told
[1:03:27] about Gideon right but there is a point
[1:03:30] that I want to point out
[1:03:33] as we're reading this
[1:03:36] even in the salutation that he was
[1:03:39] greeted with verse 11 says
[1:03:42] now he he's dealing with this yearly
[1:03:46] attack of the enemy
[1:03:48] taking away what they have okay now
[1:03:51] watch what the scripture says and there
[1:03:53] came an angel of the Lord
[1:03:55] and sat under an oak
[1:03:58] which was in ofra that pertained unto
[1:04:02] joash
[1:04:03] the abaya's right and his son Gideon now
[1:04:07] I want you to pay particular attention
[1:04:10] and his son Gideon
[1:04:13] threshed wheat
[1:04:15] by the wine press
[1:04:19] does that sound logical
[1:04:22] wine presses where you make wine The
[1:04:25] Wine Press is not where you thresh wheat
[1:04:32] he did it for a reason he threshed Wheat
[1:04:35] by the wine press to hide it
[1:04:39] from the midianites
[1:04:43] so he had to come up with some kind of
[1:04:45] strategy
[1:04:46] some kind of way to thwart the enemy
[1:04:49] some kind of way to hide away something
[1:04:52] to sustain the people
[1:04:58] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[1:05:01] him and said unto him the Lord is with
[1:05:04] thee thou Mighty Man of Valor now I used
[1:05:09] to read this and I was like why would he
[1:05:12] be called a a man of Valor and he out
[1:05:15] hiding
[1:05:20] but he had a purpose for hiding
[1:05:25] he had a purpose for doing what he was
[1:05:28] doing on and in my mind and in the minds
[1:05:31] of many people you might think of him
[1:05:34] less
[1:05:35] because why didn't he just go confront
[1:05:38] the enemy
[1:05:39] why didn't he get some troops together
[1:05:41] and go out and
[1:05:43] see listen this is the point that I
[1:05:45] wanted to point out here that in
[1:05:48] Gideon's Behavior we might think that he
[1:05:51] was out of place and out of position you
[1:05:54] don't dress wheat or at the wine press
[1:05:57] you thresh wheat on the threshing floor
[1:06:00] and the threshing floor has great
[1:06:02] significance it's where the seed is
[1:06:05] separated from the shuck
[1:06:07] oh
[1:06:09] very similar to what goes on in the
[1:06:11] church setting
[1:06:12] because
[1:06:14] when you come to church everybody might
[1:06:17] be dressed the same everybody might sing
[1:06:20] but sometimes the seed is being
[1:06:22] separated from the shut right in here
[1:06:27] so the threshing floor is very
[1:06:28] significant so it might appear that
[1:06:30] Gideon was someone out of place
[1:06:33] threshing wheat on
[1:06:35] at the wine press
[1:06:38] and so the point that I was trying to
[1:06:40] bring out was listen sometimes
[1:06:42] Everything Is Not What It appears to be
[1:06:50] because when I first started reading
[1:06:52] this and and reading
[1:06:54] I'm not talking about reading an old
[1:06:56] instant Revelation you know like some
[1:06:59] people
[1:07:00] um as soon as you re oh I got it
[1:07:03] um
[1:07:03] sometimes you gotta go back and read
[1:07:05] things over and over again until the
[1:07:07] Lord acquitting it to you right
[1:07:09] so initially reading it
[1:07:12] I said man he's hiding
[1:07:14] but the salutation that he was greeted
[1:07:17] with he was called a mighty man of Valor
[1:07:21] and it was all because what God saw in
[1:07:25] him
[1:07:27] you know about two months ago
[1:07:29] um
[1:07:30] we did a thing in Elizabeth City we we
[1:07:33] do this routinely they're teachers and
[1:07:35] principals they'll call and they'll
[1:07:37] reached out to
[1:07:39] um pastors and ministers in the
[1:07:42] community
[1:07:42] and they say hey we're going to have a
[1:07:44] lockdown tonight so what a lockdown
[1:07:46] consists of is a bunch of middle school
[1:07:49] maybe 13 to 15 year old or 12 to 15 year
[1:07:54] old boys
[1:07:56] and all of them troubled youth
[1:07:58] all of them are well known in the
[1:08:01] principal's office
[1:08:02] all of them have behavior issues or
[1:08:06] whatever the case might be and so we
[1:08:09] come and we sit them down in an
[1:08:11] environment with some structure right
[1:08:14] they don't come in and run wild though
[1:08:16] that's what their nature is they want to
[1:08:18] just take all oh we want to go play nope
[1:08:20] wait wait we're going to sit down and
[1:08:22] we're going to
[1:08:24] give you some structure we're going to
[1:08:25] tell you what the agenda is what we're
[1:08:27] going to do tonight what what the
[1:08:29] objective is it's never just to let you
[1:08:31] come and run wild
[1:08:34] the objective is for all these men who
[1:08:36] have sacrificed their time to come and
[1:08:39] speak to you and interact with you to
[1:08:42] have an opportunity to deposit something
[1:08:44] in you positively
[1:08:47] so there was one young boy
[1:08:49] um when we were talking to him we were
[1:08:51] addressing them as young men
[1:08:55] and I guess he had heard that phrase one
[1:08:58] time too many and he said why y'all keep
[1:09:00] calling me a young man I'm a boy
[1:09:04] I said well that's kind of different
[1:09:07] a lot of them you know want to be
[1:09:08] acknowledged as a man but he recognized
[1:09:11] where he was now why y'all keep calling
[1:09:14] me a young man I'm a boy I'm not a man I
[1:09:17] said what I'm talking to is the
[1:09:19] potential that's in you
[1:09:21] if you keep living one day
[1:09:25] you will obtain the chronological age to
[1:09:28] be a man but we want to put some in you
[1:09:30] to make sure that you are a man
[1:09:33] there are 25 and 30 year olds that still
[1:09:37] behave like boys
[1:09:40] they don't always equate to a number
[1:09:43] 18 you can go to war and die for your
[1:09:46] country but I don't even think they can
[1:09:49] uh buy a can of beer or whatever at 18.
[1:09:51] but you can go die for your so the
[1:09:54] numbers don't always add up right
[1:09:57] right so we got to meet them where they
[1:09:59] are
[1:10:00] and try to help them see the potential
[1:10:04] that is in themselves
[1:10:07] if you listen if you've been told all
[1:10:09] your life you ain't never going to be
[1:10:10] nothing
[1:10:12] unless there's somebody who comes and
[1:10:15] shows a different scene right you are
[1:10:17] very subject to produce the seed that
[1:10:20] has been planted
[1:10:22] words are seeds the seed is the word of
[1:10:26] God
[1:10:27] and and one thing I will say I really
[1:10:29] appreciate the the school superintendent
[1:10:32] because when he allows us to have
[1:10:33] functions they don't say don't pray in
[1:10:36] Jesus name
[1:10:37] he have never said that
[1:10:39] a lot of school systems around America
[1:10:41] will forbid you from doing that they had
[1:10:44] three young people that died in the
[1:10:46] Middle School right in the school
[1:10:48] and they called a hawk and allowed us to
[1:10:52] use the whole football stadium
[1:10:54] and every Minister who was there was
[1:10:57] given the opportunity to pray
[1:11:00] and not once did they say don't pray in
[1:11:03] Jesus name we don't want you to offend
[1:11:04] somebody so I respect that man
[1:11:07] um more than any school administrator I
[1:11:10] have ever met
[1:11:11] because he's doing that at a cost
[1:11:15] his bosses could really confront him
[1:11:18] about that and create a problem but what
[1:11:20] happened he understand that there's a
[1:11:22] need
[1:11:24] and if we don't do something to unlock
[1:11:26] the potential in these young folks
[1:11:31] you have very few opportunities to
[1:11:33] impact what's going on in your own
[1:11:35] community and so guess what I want to
[1:11:37] try to do tonight unlock the potential
[1:11:40] that is in some of these Believers
[1:11:42] that's in here right now
[1:11:45] so listen when I was a young man
[1:11:48] um I was hard-headed
[1:11:50] my grandmother said that boy is sneaky
[1:11:54] and she knew exactly what she was
[1:11:56] talking about
[1:11:58] and I had an uncle that would often say
[1:12:00] and he wouldn't say it to me directly
[1:12:02] but I always hear it that boy ain't
[1:12:05] gonna never be nothing
[1:12:07] no he never won't be nothing
[1:12:10] and and the more that I heard that it
[1:12:13] really hardened something in me to say
[1:12:15] I'm going to show him
[1:12:18] that I am going to be something
[1:12:22] so I did not allow that seed to Trump to
[1:12:25] see that my mama was telling me listen
[1:12:27] brothers and sisters I'm gonna read
[1:12:30] something that I wrote down
[1:12:33] so we find ourselves living in a time
[1:12:36] when people are more concerned what
[1:12:40] others say about them than what God said
[1:12:43] about them
[1:12:47] people put more stock and more
[1:12:49] confidence in a rumor in what somebody
[1:12:52] said on Facebook or Tick Tock or
[1:12:56] Instagram more concerned with what
[1:12:59] somebody said on there than what your
[1:13:01] mom and daddy told you you can be
[1:13:03] anything you want to be
[1:13:06] so to flip it to the spiritual side we
[1:13:09] can do all things through Christ
[1:13:11] [Applause]
[1:13:15] that potential is there
[1:13:17] but it needs to be unlocked and the way
[1:13:20] is
[1:13:21] the way that it gets unlocked is you got
[1:13:23] to believe it
[1:13:26] I tell my little congregation back at
[1:13:29] home it does me no good to stand and
[1:13:32] preach and pour my heart out of nobody
[1:13:34] ain't gonna receive it
[1:13:35] ain't nobody gonna try to live it
[1:13:40] what good would it do and I'm not one of
[1:13:43] those preachers who said I've heard this
[1:13:45] all my life I don't care if everybody
[1:13:47] leaves I'll preach to the pews where I
[1:13:49] ain't got there yet
[1:13:51] I ain't got that Revelation yet
[1:13:54] I know God is able of these stones to
[1:13:57] raise up children of Abraham but I don't
[1:13:59] see many preachers out preaching to no
[1:14:01] stones
[1:14:05] they want somebody that can hear the
[1:14:07] word
[1:14:08] to be able to receive the word and then
[1:14:12] manifest the word see when you plant a
[1:14:15] seed
[1:14:16] ground you
[1:14:18] expectation that is going to grow and
[1:14:21] it's going to Bear forth whatever type
[1:14:22] of fruit it is
[1:14:25] and if you go through that process of
[1:14:27] tilling the soil and fertilizing and
[1:14:29] planting and all of that and you don't
[1:14:32] see anything come up you're going to be
[1:14:34] discouraged
[1:14:37] and the whole world Brothers had been
[1:14:40] preached to
[1:14:41] the message and going around the world
[1:14:43] who knows how many times
[1:14:45] right so the field has already been sown
[1:14:49] what we're looking for now is
[1:14:51] manifestation
[1:14:54] the whole creation is groaning and
[1:14:57] waiting travailing waiting for what us
[1:15:00] to manifest
[1:15:02] to manifest Christ
[1:15:07] for somebody to be able to say one day
[1:15:09] you know man
[1:15:10] well the more man he's he's kind of I
[1:15:13] don't really know I don't really like
[1:15:15] them but one thing I can say he's been
[1:15:17] with Christ
[1:15:18] that's what they said about this like
[1:15:20] the disciples they perceived that they
[1:15:23] were ignorant and unlearned men but yet
[1:15:27] they had to take knowledge
[1:15:29] that there's something about that Christ
[1:15:31] they've been hanging around with
[1:15:40] the things that he preached over the
[1:15:42] pulpit they starting to live it I see
[1:15:44] what he said
[1:15:45] oh the word becomes flesh
[1:15:49] watch my scripture I I never used to say
[1:15:52] I had a favorite scripture right but one
[1:15:56] of the scriptures that means the most to
[1:15:57] me and it was what reason I named my
[1:16:00] church what I did is in Saint John 1 and
[1:16:03] 14 right we know up one and one says in
[1:16:06] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:16:07] was flesh and the word
[1:16:10] I mean the Word was God and
[1:16:12] but then you go down to verse 14 is the
[1:16:15] verse that I really want to highlight
[1:16:16] and it says and the Word was made flesh
[1:16:21] and dwelled Among Us right
[1:16:25] so guess what brother and sisters so
[1:16:27] Jesus's whole life whole Ministry was to
[1:16:30] do one thing fulfill scripture
[1:16:34] so if the word had to be made flesh in
[1:16:37] him how do we how do we we're going to
[1:16:39] escape
[1:16:41] somebody ought to be able to see Christ
[1:16:44] in you
[1:16:48] that men might see your good works
[1:16:51] and glorify the father and have what are
[1:16:53] they saying they're saying attributes of
[1:16:55] Christ on display
[1:16:59] and in manifesting time just because
[1:17:02] Gideon was hiding it's not always what
[1:17:06] you see
[1:17:09] I remember a time when I thought
[1:17:13] and I would even say this even after I
[1:17:16] had accepted Christ
[1:17:18] um man I was on my way to hell
[1:17:21] no I won't
[1:17:23] because look if I am a Son of God I
[1:17:27] always was
[1:17:29] but what was happening I was walking
[1:17:31] after the course of this world and so
[1:17:34] people were judging me based on what
[1:17:36] they saw
[1:17:38] and I didn't have enough confidence in
[1:17:40] myself to know and believe that wait a
[1:17:43] minute
[1:17:45] if I am if I ever was a Son of God I
[1:17:49] always was
[1:17:51] and the Lord saw me when I was out there
[1:17:54] on the street
[1:17:57] saw me doing things and I would be
[1:17:59] ashamed to even repeat
[1:18:02] but do I believe or not that he said I
[1:18:06] was chosen in him before the foundation
[1:18:08] of the world
[1:18:12] before I did any of those
[1:18:14] old slave will be held you know when I
[1:18:16] used to share my testimony with my own
[1:18:18] family they couldn't believe it
[1:18:20] said not not you Calvin you you never
[1:18:23] did it I said oh yeah I did that
[1:18:27] they couldn't believe it
[1:18:31] but when sin gets a hold of you brother
[1:18:33] and sister
[1:18:34] you won't have any clue The Depths that
[1:18:37] it can take you to
[1:18:40] you don't have you don't have a clue you
[1:18:42] you might say oh I would never do that
[1:18:44] oh my child would never do that
[1:18:49] well until they've been born again
[1:18:54] don't don't put any limits on it no
[1:18:57] they'll only go this far
[1:19:00] every time I came close to the line that
[1:19:03] my mama told me not to cross I heard her
[1:19:06] voice
[1:19:06] but guess what there came a point in
[1:19:08] time when I heard what she said and I
[1:19:10] stepped over that line
[1:19:14] and I paid for it
[1:19:17] because the enemy will take you so far
[1:19:20] that you can't even find your way back
[1:19:26] and you would do things that you never
[1:19:28] do you think that prodigal son ever
[1:19:31] imagined in his wildest dreams that he
[1:19:34] would be in the Hog Pen eating the slop
[1:19:36] with the hog do you think he ever
[1:19:37] thought he would get there when he asked
[1:19:40] his daddy daddy just give me my
[1:19:41] inheritance now and just let me go
[1:19:44] do you think that he thought that was
[1:19:46] going to be the outcome no he didn't
[1:19:50] he just wanted to go out and enjoy his
[1:19:52] life
[1:19:53] riotous living
[1:19:56] and I heard somebody say a fool in his
[1:19:58] money
[1:20:01] soon Departed
[1:20:04] you hear all the time all these I was
[1:20:06] standing in the store trying to get a
[1:20:09] cup of coffee out when I finished
[1:20:10] fishing I stopped to the store and I get
[1:20:13] a cup of coffee for my ride home
[1:20:15] and the lie was so long and I'm trying
[1:20:19] to figure out why the line was sold
[1:20:21] everybody trying to hit the Powerball
[1:20:27] everybody
[1:20:29] trying to get lucky
[1:20:33] and I said man this just the time and
[1:20:35] energy
[1:20:36] right one lady she had a stack of
[1:20:38] tickets man about as thick as a uh you
[1:20:41] remember the little New Testament Bibles
[1:20:43] she had a little new she had that many
[1:20:45] tickets and so thick I said she gonna
[1:20:48] throw away a whole bunch of money
[1:20:51] and somebody in Florida I heard won the
[1:20:54] money so all that money she's spending
[1:20:56] and everybody else who was in line
[1:21:00] look how we put our hopes in things
[1:21:03] right when all my hope is in the Lord
[1:21:06] that's the only hope that I have is in
[1:21:09] Christ
[1:21:10] apart from that I'm lost
[1:21:13] so Gideon
[1:21:15] though his outward appearance may have
[1:21:18] seemed that he was not even fit to be
[1:21:22] called a mighty man of Valor God knew
[1:21:25] what was in Gideon
[1:21:27] and later on he became a tool in the
[1:21:30] hands of God to tear down Satan's
[1:21:32] kingdom The Groves and all those things
[1:21:35] where they worship idols
[1:21:37] and when it was done the Elder said
[1:21:40] Gideon have done this thing why because
[1:21:42] even though some might have thought he
[1:21:45] want nothing there were some people who
[1:21:47] saw something in that boy
[1:21:52] see if you can't when Jesus went to the
[1:21:55] uh Temple the Bible says as his custom
[1:21:59] was and he picked up the scroll forward
[1:22:02] to read do you know what he turned to he
[1:22:04] turned to the prophecy of Isaiah that
[1:22:07] was speaking concerning himself
[1:22:10] you need to find your scriptural
[1:22:12] identification
[1:22:15] if we just read the Bible as a novel
[1:22:18] you're going to miss it
[1:22:20] so many people take an undertaking and
[1:22:23] they there's programs that you can have
[1:22:25] on your phone or your tablet and it'll
[1:22:28] help you it'll structure you how to read
[1:22:30] the whole Bible in a year all right
[1:22:33] and it's not there's nothing wrong with
[1:22:36] that right it's it's a good undertaking
[1:22:38] to read it
[1:22:39] but if you I had people who talk to me I
[1:22:42] used to minister into prison for like
[1:22:44] seven years he said man I never read
[1:22:46] that book about seven times
[1:22:48] I said so you read it seven times but it
[1:22:51] haven't changed you
[1:22:53] are you reading it like you're reading a
[1:22:55] novel
[1:22:56] you doing a rerun like they do with TV
[1:22:58] shows and movies it ain't had no effect
[1:23:01] on you but the word says here a little
[1:23:04] there a little line upon line and
[1:23:06] preacher you never caught the precept
[1:23:09] you never caught the mind of God because
[1:23:12] you were reading a book
[1:23:14] and when you got the Genesis and it was
[1:23:16] about eight 18 or 20 pages of Hebrew got
[1:23:20] this one and maybe got that one
[1:23:25] you got stuck right there
[1:23:28] everything that you had read previously
[1:23:30] you kind of lost the meaning well what
[1:23:33] is the significance of this that's not
[1:23:35] the way the Bible is intended to be read
[1:23:37] there's nothing wrong with it
[1:23:39] at least you're reading it
[1:23:43] but you need and all you'll get and you
[1:23:45] need to get an understanding
[1:23:48] when the Lord sent Philip and joined him
[1:23:51] to the eunuchs Chariot the first
[1:23:53] question he asked him was understand is
[1:23:56] thou what thou readest
[1:23:59] he said how can I accept some
[1:24:02] man
[1:24:04] come and help me come and show me
[1:24:09] so we got a purpose help somebody else
[1:24:12] what's your testimony
[1:24:16] and it don't have to be a spotlight or
[1:24:18] you could you can testify about how your
[1:24:20] candle got lit
[1:24:23] the song says This Little Light of Mine
[1:24:28] you think everybody think they gotta
[1:24:29] have a strobe light
[1:24:31] like they got a used car sale shining
[1:24:34] across the sky no if if you cut every
[1:24:38] light off in here and I turn This little
[1:24:40] light on on my cell phone I can find my
[1:24:42] way right out that door
[1:24:44] with a little light
[1:24:48] but the little light that we have if we
[1:24:51] take it and we hide it
[1:24:54] who are we going to help
[1:24:56] who are we going to benefit
[1:24:58] turn with me real quick I'm gonna read
[1:25:00] another scripture
[1:25:06] sometimes you know
[1:25:09] self-doubt
[1:25:12] is a powerful tool of the enemy
[1:25:15] and sometimes as I said that seed was
[1:25:19] planted by someone responsible for
[1:25:21] nurturing a child
[1:25:23] boy you just like your daddy
[1:25:27] you want no good
[1:25:30] instead of planting a different seed
[1:25:33] and nurturing it
[1:25:35] and and helping it grow right
[1:25:37] pruning it sometime when it needed to be
[1:25:40] pruned
[1:25:41] I got a rose bush in my yard and it I
[1:25:44] never really took care of it like I
[1:25:46] should have but when I start taking care
[1:25:48] of it man I've never seen so many
[1:25:50] beautiful roses show up
[1:25:52] why because it had to be tended to
[1:25:55] people looking for their Ministry what
[1:25:58] should I be doing Lord show me what you
[1:25:59] want me to do and you got four children
[1:26:01] that don't even know nothing about yes
[1:26:03] Jesus loved me
[1:26:05] you talking about a Ministry the age of
[1:26:07] ministry right there
[1:26:10] that's how the Lord won me with my
[1:26:12] children
[1:26:14] my baby boy used to stand beside me and
[1:26:16] when I shaved he wanted to shave I had
[1:26:19] my boom box on and I knew every word to
[1:26:22] the rap song
[1:26:24] and next thing I know he knew every word
[1:26:28] and the Lord convicted my heart one
[1:26:30] night and said he know every word to
[1:26:32] that song but he don't know nothing
[1:26:34] about yes Jesus loves me
[1:26:37] whose fault was that
[1:26:39] it was my fault
[1:26:41] I'm I'm cultivating the wrong seed
[1:26:45] I'm I'm demonstrating the wrong Behavior
[1:26:47] right before my son
[1:26:50] and the Lord used that to convict my
[1:26:52] heart and that began me pursuing all
[1:26:56] right Lord what can I do
[1:26:58] to change and I had to lift up my hands
[1:27:01] and surrender
[1:27:04] turn with me to Exodus 14. right
[1:27:09] we're in the Third Exodus
[1:27:13] and we know Exodus is in two parts it's
[1:27:15] not just coming out yeah I came out of
[1:27:18] the world but now it's time to come into
[1:27:20] not and not just in the church either
[1:27:25] it's time to come into Christ
[1:27:28] because we came out we came in and now
[1:27:31] we're gonna go up
[1:27:33] that's what I'm looking forward to
[1:27:37] Exodus 14.
[1:27:43] to get in
[1:27:44] knew
[1:27:47] Harvest after harvest the midianites the
[1:27:51] Malachi's they were coming
[1:27:54] so slowly he devised a plan on how to
[1:27:58] preserve life
[1:28:00] hold back something that they can't come
[1:28:02] and just take everything
[1:28:04] see if the enemy had his way he'll come
[1:28:06] take everything from you
[1:28:09] and even if the Lord allowed like he
[1:28:10] allowed with job
[1:28:13] he said yeah I'll let you touch them but
[1:28:15] just don't
[1:28:16] you can't have his life
[1:28:20] but job was learning patience
[1:28:26] and I read a quote the other night it
[1:28:28] said Faith Waits with patience for the
[1:28:32] Fulfillment of the promised word
[1:28:37] we if we've been given a promise
[1:28:41] patiently wait for it
[1:28:44] not get discouraged when oh I've been
[1:28:46] praying for that boy for five years oh
[1:28:48] my husband still ain't say oh I don't
[1:28:50] know whatever the occasion may be you
[1:28:52] feeling the blank
[1:28:54] whatever it is you praying for and it
[1:28:56] seemed like it's tarrying
[1:28:58] remember Faith ways with patience
[1:29:02] for the Fulfillment of the promised
[1:29:04] worry
[1:29:07] and you can encourage yourself with that
[1:29:09] so Lord I seen you do it
[1:29:13] there was a sister used to come to the
[1:29:15] church believe in God and her husband
[1:29:16] was going to get saved she would put her
[1:29:18] pocketbook right beside her and if
[1:29:21] somebody tried to sit there and say no
[1:29:22] don't sit there you're gonna sit on my
[1:29:23] husband
[1:29:25] what's wrong with her
[1:29:29] don't sit there you're gonna sit on my
[1:29:32] husband that's a by faith
[1:29:36] she was claiming that she saw and she
[1:29:38] waited with patience
[1:29:40] guess what he is now he's a deacon he
[1:29:43] was a song leader
[1:29:46] she waited
[1:29:47] Faith had us stand right there
[1:29:51] not running hard in the cave
[1:29:55] testify to what you believe
[1:29:59] if you said Lord you promised me my
[1:30:01] children hold on to that
[1:30:03] I don't care how Wayward they might sing
[1:30:11] but people that know me from
[1:30:14] back in the day as they say
[1:30:16] they will testify for me
[1:30:19] I said man I can tell you I can tell you
[1:30:22] when he changed he was out there with us
[1:30:24] he was doing everything we were doing I
[1:30:27] mean everything and then some
[1:30:30] but first thing happened he met that
[1:30:32] girl
[1:30:35] then we stopped seeing them we didn't
[1:30:37] see him that much
[1:30:39] then we got married
[1:30:40] then we decided to go to church
[1:30:44] and he said man I'm telling you I just
[1:30:46] knew he was coming back but he ain't
[1:30:48] never come back
[1:30:49] foreign
[1:30:50] If any man be in Christ
[1:30:53] he's a new creature
[1:30:55] old things are passed away and guess
[1:30:57] what he said I like using this word oh
[1:31:01] things
[1:31:03] become new well I'm still I'm a work in
[1:31:05] progress
[1:31:08] and I heard that about 10 times this
[1:31:10] week and it's still fresh in my mind I'm
[1:31:12] a work in progress let me tell you how
[1:31:15] you translate that man I'm still
[1:31:17] slipping
[1:31:20] still I still need to be delivered
[1:31:24] that's what they're telling you
[1:31:26] I'm a working man we all work in
[1:31:28] progress but guess what the work has
[1:31:30] been finished in Christ
[1:31:32] when he gave up the ghost
[1:31:36] whole pantry
[1:31:39] what we're waiting for now is the
[1:31:40] changing of these bodies
[1:31:45] I was talking to one of brother gives
[1:31:48] old Deacon
[1:31:49] um
[1:31:50] and we were just encouraging each other
[1:31:52] and he said he said bro I'm gonna tell
[1:31:54] you what it's like right now
[1:31:57] he said it's like a father
[1:31:59] that take his children to school
[1:32:02] and drop them off in the morning
[1:32:05] he know how long they're going to be
[1:32:07] there
[1:32:08] right they even have an expectation of
[1:32:10] how long they're going to be there but
[1:32:12] they know at the end of the day
[1:32:15] daddy's coming to get me
[1:32:17] he said that's where the church is right
[1:32:19] now
[1:32:20] he said the Lord allowed us to come here
[1:32:22] right to be tempted and tried he dropped
[1:32:24] us off at school to learn something
[1:32:28] and we just waiting for Daddy to pull up
[1:32:30] so Lord come get us out of this mess
[1:32:35] that we're in
[1:32:40] and I'll tell you
[1:32:42] sometime you want to cry out what the
[1:32:44] scripture said even so come Lord Jesus
[1:32:47] but now you won't you won't make that
[1:32:49] plea and that declaration
[1:32:52] if you're double-minded
[1:32:55] no Lord give me a little bit more time
[1:32:59] but if you know that all is well
[1:33:02] you'll say even so come Lord Jesus this
[1:33:07] see we need to know
[1:33:10] when the Bible
[1:33:12] man my testimony is I guess I should
[1:33:14] have just said I won't testify out
[1:33:15] tonight
[1:33:16] um when I began reading the Bible as a
[1:33:20] new born babe in Christ
[1:33:23] and reading it diligently when I came
[1:33:26] across the scripture in Saint John 5
[1:33:28] that said search the scriptures for
[1:33:31] yourself
[1:33:32] and then the next part it said for in
[1:33:35] them you think
[1:33:38] eternal life and I told my wife this I
[1:33:41] said it was like the word think got
[1:33:42] magnified on the page
[1:33:45] search is good for us for in them I
[1:33:47] think Lord I don't want to think I have
[1:33:49] it I want to know
[1:33:52] so how do I know I got a social
[1:33:53] scripture for myself I gotta let the
[1:33:56] Lord reveal to me that who I am
[1:33:59] and sometimes I think we still question
[1:34:02] and doubt self-doubt who we are we are
[1:34:06] the sons and daughters of almighty God
[1:34:11] and I heard the prophet saying you can
[1:34:13] know if you got the Holy Ghost you can
[1:34:14] no more darling God can die
[1:34:17] oh man
[1:34:21] you said well people dying all the time
[1:34:23] man Christians don't doubt we just sleep
[1:34:27] he said well you they bury you in the
[1:34:29] ground they put this shell in the ground
[1:34:32] but I'm not I'm not there
[1:34:35] I stood over my mama's casket and
[1:34:38] at her funeral
[1:34:41] and a bunch of Bishops and uh you know
[1:34:44] everybody was there and I just shared
[1:34:47] what was on my heart I said my mama is
[1:34:49] not in that box
[1:34:53] my mama loved the Lord she was saved
[1:34:55] born again so yes I miss her
[1:34:59] but man I'm when she died I kissed her
[1:35:02] and I said Mama see you later I didn't
[1:35:04] say goodbye see you later
[1:35:06] for there is hope
[1:35:09] of a tree
[1:35:11] if it died I shall it live again she
[1:35:13] never died she just went to sleep
[1:35:16] and sometimes we if we don't know who we
[1:35:19] are we will live so far beneath our
[1:35:22] privileges
[1:35:25] over in Kuwait
[1:35:27] in the Middle East right the the real
[1:35:30] kuwaitis they don't work
[1:35:33] the real kuwaitis don't work they are
[1:35:36] living off of the royalties from all
[1:35:39] that oil in that country
[1:35:41] so they don't even work
[1:35:45] so because they know who they are do you
[1:35:47] think they're worried about where their
[1:35:48] next meal is coming from
[1:35:50] man that oil is pumping every day they
[1:35:53] turn it on and off when they want to and
[1:35:55] when they turn it off and they start
[1:35:56] getting low that's when you see your gas
[1:35:58] prices go up
[1:35:59] it's a direct correlation
[1:36:03] what do you think they worrying about
[1:36:04] where next week's meal is coming from no
[1:36:07] I'm a Kuwaiti
[1:36:09] Mama we got oil man I'm good to go
[1:36:13] if they can have that type of confidence
[1:36:15] in who they are
[1:36:20] see we sent we sent probably from the
[1:36:24] shipyard probably
[1:36:26] 240 workers to Kuwait
[1:36:29] so the the reason I know these things oh
[1:36:32] my God you come back and tell me
[1:36:36] he said man they don't even he said
[1:36:37] there's a street that's called Gold
[1:36:39] Street
[1:36:42] I'm serious they said every night they
[1:36:45] said they it's it's locked up but they
[1:36:48] don't have a bunch of security he said
[1:36:50] because if you get caught stealing with
[1:36:52] Kuwait they'll cut your hand off
[1:36:55] and he said the goal is not the goal
[1:36:57] that you find around here he said the
[1:36:59] gold is so bright it's not a a bright
[1:37:02] shine
[1:37:06] if you walk down the street you think
[1:37:07] it's lights and it's not lights
[1:37:10] he said just the Moonlight can strike it
[1:37:12] and
[1:37:18] Glory
[1:37:20] somebody out on the street trying to
[1:37:21] sell you some gold and it's so bright
[1:37:24] and shiny you better be careful
[1:37:27] it ain't real look at them clips
[1:37:30] if you see a gap in one of them Clips up
[1:37:32] nope don't give up
[1:37:35] I've been caught that way that's why I
[1:37:37] know that right now I don't buy stuff
[1:37:39] like that no more
[1:37:42] but I ran them down and I got my money
[1:37:44] back
[1:37:46] Exodus 14 let's go to verse 12.
[1:37:56] so I like God likes to remind us of what
[1:37:59] he said
[1:38:00] watch what verse 12 says it says is not
[1:38:03] this the word that we did tell thee in
[1:38:06] Egypt saying let us along that we may
[1:38:09] serve the Egyptian see Egypt types the
[1:38:12] world and some people when they were in
[1:38:14] the world they were comfortable just
[1:38:17] leave us alone
[1:38:21] here's the analogy that I use right so
[1:38:24] used to work third shift sometime well
[1:38:27] six in the evening to 6 30 in the
[1:38:29] morning and so in the daytime was when
[1:38:31] you had to try to get some sleep
[1:38:33] and so you go in the room and you try to
[1:38:36] make it as dark as possible right as
[1:38:38] soon as you go in there and you got
[1:38:40] small children next thing you know
[1:38:41] somebody open that door
[1:38:43] we'll turn the light on right and
[1:38:45] because you are comfortable in the
[1:38:49] darkness the first thing you say is cut
[1:38:52] off that light
[1:38:57] so guess what the Bible says about that
[1:38:59] it said men love Darkness rather than
[1:39:03] light because their deeds are wicked
[1:39:06] light will
[1:39:09] and so here you come
[1:39:12] trying to witness to somebody you come
[1:39:14] with all this light the word is light
[1:39:18] and they they turn you down you know
[1:39:21] what they're saying turn that light off
[1:39:22] I'm comfortable in my sin
[1:39:28] it's not just the word that we do tell
[1:39:30] thee let us alone own that we may serve
[1:39:33] the Egyptian for it had been better for
[1:39:35] us to serve the Egyptians than that we
[1:39:39] should die in the wilderness
[1:39:41] I heard the scripture say well you know
[1:39:43] once upon a time it seemed like we had
[1:39:45] more when we poured out drinks to Diana
[1:39:47] the false god
[1:39:49] seemed like we were prospering more
[1:39:52] but now that I sought my heart to follow
[1:39:54] the one true God man everything is
[1:39:57] against me that's a good sign
[1:40:01] it's a good sign
[1:40:03] the Bible warns us beware when all men
[1:40:06] speak well of you
[1:40:08] what is that saying
[1:40:12] I mean you compromising somewhere
[1:40:15] because you talking to a whole lot of
[1:40:16] people don't agree with you beware so on
[1:40:19] my job you know
[1:40:23] my cousin used to work
[1:40:26] in the trouble there so everybody have
[1:40:28] problem with your computer the majority
[1:40:30] of them knew my cousin she was one of
[1:40:31] the lead texts in there and so when they
[1:40:34] would come invariably she would say oh
[1:40:36] do you know Kelvin oh yeah I know him
[1:40:38] he's a nice guy oh I know him yeah he's
[1:40:40] a good man uh whatever she said
[1:40:42] everybody have something good to say I
[1:40:44] said no you just ain't got the right
[1:40:45] ones in there yet
[1:40:48] but when she said that it made me think
[1:40:51] be careful when all men speak well of
[1:40:55] you
[1:40:56] why either you ain't standing for
[1:40:59] nothing
[1:41:00] and they say oh man he's easy anything
[1:41:02] you know he'll let you go or whatever
[1:41:04] the case might be
[1:41:06] careful right
[1:41:08] man when you're trying to do the will of
[1:41:10] the Lord for every action there's an
[1:41:12] equal and opposite reaction
[1:41:15] when you trying to go this way the enemy
[1:41:17] is trying to push you back
[1:41:21] well they say you will never be nothing
[1:41:22] my uncle said I would never be nothing
[1:41:26] and that really made me determined to
[1:41:29] prove them wrong
[1:41:30] all right let me let me read this it's a
[1:41:33] verse 13. and Moses said unto the people
[1:41:37] fear ye not why why are we sometimes
[1:41:42] afraid to step out on the word why are
[1:41:45] we afraid to hold on to the promise
[1:41:51] we should not be right listen
[1:41:54] perfect love casts out all fear
[1:41:58] and when we have it our our faith is not
[1:42:01] made perfect in love
[1:42:04] so why are we fearful so he said fear ye
[1:42:08] not stand still and see the salvation of
[1:42:11] the Lord which he will show you today
[1:42:15] somebody might be battling something
[1:42:17] right now the Lord can show you today
[1:42:21] that that stronghold that you built
[1:42:25] or that you allow the enemy to build to
[1:42:27] keep you fixed in or hidden in a cave
[1:42:32] it's the enemy but watch what he said
[1:42:34] here
[1:42:35] for the Egyptians whom you have seen
[1:42:38] today ye shall see them again
[1:42:42] no more forever
[1:42:46] see these are the things that I'm trying
[1:42:48] to
[1:42:49] besides that we
[1:42:51] hold on to
[1:42:52] what God Said not what the world said
[1:42:57] for example in a Narcotics Anonymous
[1:43:00] well you always going to be an addict
[1:43:02] or you always going to be an alcoholic
[1:43:07] man that the devil is a liar
[1:43:09] if the Lord delivered me I am not I'm
[1:43:12] not alcoholic no more
[1:43:16] but what are they doing when they're
[1:43:18] telling you that psychologically they
[1:43:19] playing games with you but what they're
[1:43:21] doing is giving you room to say I
[1:43:23] relapse
[1:43:26] when the
[1:43:27] when total surrender will bring total
[1:43:30] Deliverance
[1:43:32] ask me how I know
[1:43:35] smoking drink every day the good Lord
[1:43:38] sent
[1:43:41] but when the Lord delivered me
[1:43:43] I never had a desire to go back once
[1:43:48] it's not about relapse it's about being
[1:43:51] delivered
[1:43:54] and see when you entertain that Spirit
[1:43:57] it has every right to stay right there
[1:44:01] I was talking to a young man last week
[1:44:03] and he going through some issues and I
[1:44:06] said listen man have you ever thought
[1:44:07] about a government job and I already
[1:44:09] knew what was going on
[1:44:13] and he was honest matter of fact he
[1:44:15] wasn't just a young man it was my uncle
[1:44:16] my nephew he said uh
[1:44:19] I ain't got one problem I smoke too much
[1:44:23] so you can't stop long enough
[1:44:26] to pass the test to give a sample and
[1:44:30] get a job then guess what you don't need
[1:44:32] no job
[1:44:38] there are so many good jobs out today
[1:44:40] covet messed people up
[1:44:43] getting free money checks and
[1:44:47] people will stand outside in front of a
[1:44:50] store with a sign and the sign behind
[1:44:54] them says help wanted
[1:44:59] now it's a hundred degrees outside
[1:45:03] you got bottles of water on the ground
[1:45:05] they hot
[1:45:07] you'll stand out there and hold a sign
[1:45:09] but you could go in McDonald's whereas
[1:45:13] cool they're gonna pay 15 an hour and
[1:45:16] you can get some benefits but you rather
[1:45:19] stand there and hold a sign
[1:45:22] no you don't want to work
[1:45:24] ain't no need to asking me for my money
[1:45:28] I worked 31 years to get this retirement
[1:45:33] if you want to stand here
[1:45:35] right outside the building that's hiring
[1:45:39] I mean they got ads everywhere
[1:45:41] Amtrak hiring
[1:45:44] Mercedes-Benz
[1:45:46] plants down here in South Carolina 30
[1:45:48] something dollars an hour people still
[1:45:50] standing out holding signs
[1:45:53] man I don't care what I was on I try to
[1:45:55] quit long enough to get a job
[1:45:59] no way in the world I got too much pride
[1:46:01] they'll see a lady coming in the store
[1:46:03] and say miss you got any chance what
[1:46:05] kind of man
[1:46:09] can allow yourself to stoop so low to
[1:46:11] ask a woman for some change
[1:46:14] come on man but that's how low sin will
[1:46:17] take you right
[1:46:19] I'm just here to tell you um
[1:46:21] we we should not live beneath our
[1:46:24] privileges
[1:46:26] and everything ain't always what you see
[1:46:28] it seemed like Gideon was
[1:46:30] fearful but no Gideon was being used by
[1:46:32] God
[1:46:33] so that the enemy didn't get all the
[1:46:37] bread
[1:46:38] something to sustain the people and when
[1:46:41] God used him he went and tore down those
[1:46:44] Groves where they worship idols and the
[1:46:47] Lord began to strengthen them amen so
[1:46:50] whatever it is in your life right let
[1:46:53] the Lord tear it down
[1:46:57] let them tear it down
[1:47:00] so that he can use you
[1:47:02] for if it's no more than sharing your
[1:47:05] testimony
[1:47:08] I was telling the brother his testimony
[1:47:10] the other night blessed me it was
[1:47:13] it was part of my story I've been
[1:47:16] through the same thing
[1:47:18] but when the Lord delivered me I never
[1:47:20] had a desire to go back
[1:47:23] they took Christ to get me to that point
[1:47:26] but once he delivered me I never had a
[1:47:29] desire to go back
[1:47:31] amen and if you are here tonight and you
[1:47:33] holding on to something
[1:47:35] if you're allowed the enemy to build a
[1:47:37] stronghold in your mind you can be set
[1:47:39] free tonight right because we're the
[1:47:41] spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:47:45] but you got to get sick and tired of
[1:47:47] being sick and tired well you got to get
[1:47:49] sick and tired of being in that same
[1:47:51] ruts
[1:47:56] don't know whether you're going
[1:47:57] backwards or forward that's how when
[1:47:59] you're in a rut you're spinning wheels
[1:48:03] the only way you get out of that hole
[1:48:05] you got to elevate and put something
[1:48:07] solid underneath it or either somebody
[1:48:09] come pull you out
[1:48:11] but guess what oh my goodness they can't
[1:48:14] when they come to pull you out they're
[1:48:16] not gonna get down in the ditch with you
[1:48:19] you know that's what that's what's
[1:48:21] happening
[1:48:22] right out in these nominal churches oh
[1:48:24] well the young people need gospel rap
[1:48:29] no they don't
[1:48:31] they need the same thing that save you
[1:48:33] they need the word and it needs some
[1:48:35] examples
[1:48:38] how foolish would I look I got a record
[1:48:41] you in the ditch and I'm going back down
[1:48:43] into this with you now we both stuck
[1:48:47] no somebody need to stay up on Solid
[1:48:49] Ground Solid Ground is on the word amen
[1:48:52] so if we stand on this right then we can
[1:48:55] help somebody
[1:48:57] we stand on the word we can help
[1:49:00] ourselves
[1:49:02] apply the word to your life apply the
[1:49:04] word to your situation and that's not
[1:49:07] just a cliche
[1:49:09] um
[1:49:10] but you the word will work
[1:49:13] all this other stuff they're trying try
[1:49:15] this try that you know doctors practice
[1:49:17] medicine
[1:49:19] you ever thought about that why I go to
[1:49:21] somebody and pay them and give them your
[1:49:24] insurance card and they practicing
[1:49:26] oh I want to go to you after you got it
[1:49:29] right not after you
[1:49:33] but we know that the word works
[1:49:36] it's not something that we practice it's
[1:49:38] something that we'll believe in
[1:49:40] something we allow the Lord to use
[1:49:45] to correct our situation one thing about
[1:49:48] correction let's stand to our feet you
[1:49:51] know I um
[1:49:52] so when my when my uncle used to always
[1:49:54] say I won't gonna be nobody
[1:49:57] you know when I retired from the
[1:49:58] shipyard and at 31 years
[1:50:01] there was only one person hired in me in
[1:50:04] my department
[1:50:06] there were there were times when I had
[1:50:08] to give briefings to the chief of Naval
[1:50:11] operations it looked like we was having
[1:50:13] a senate hearing they on one side of the
[1:50:16] table I'm on the other side of the table
[1:50:17] all these microphones
[1:50:20] um
[1:50:21] there were people in Washington DC when
[1:50:23] we had trouble in Seattle
[1:50:26] they were getting ready to shut all the
[1:50:28] work down and they said well who do
[1:50:29] y'all have there they said we got Mr
[1:50:31] Morty okay you can continue
[1:50:34] but my uncle said I want to never be
[1:50:36] nothing
[1:50:38] I told my brother I'm a writer but what
[1:50:40] you gotta write a book about I said have
[1:50:42] you ever talked to Colin Powell
[1:50:46] have you ever talked to the chief of
[1:50:48] Naval operation have you ever been
[1:50:50] compared to the man told me you belong
[1:50:53] in DC with Colin Powell Mr Moore because
[1:50:55] you got me motivated
[1:50:57] so what you mean what I got to write a
[1:50:59] book about if I tell somebody how I got
[1:51:01] saved I can write a book about that
[1:51:06] the Lord brought me out of those streets
[1:51:09] from Philadelphia to Portsmouth Virginia
[1:51:11] to North Carolina he saved me
[1:51:15] took me out of that old life and gave me
[1:51:17] a new life and on Friday night tonight
[1:51:19] I'm in church
[1:51:21] trying to encourage somebody amen God
[1:51:23] bless you
[1:51:26] anyone here tonight and I'm I'm serious
[1:51:30] um if you have anything that's kind of
[1:51:33] got you boxed in or something that's
[1:51:35] holding you in one place right if you
[1:51:38] desire to be delivered Deliverance is
[1:51:40] here
[1:51:42] if you sink and you
[1:51:45] trusting in the doctor right
[1:51:48] that's okay dollars have their place
[1:51:50] right all right Mama I go to the doctor
[1:51:52] and I try to do what they tell me when I
[1:51:54] go
[1:51:55] but why I come to church right the great
[1:51:58] physician is here but not do what he
[1:52:01] wants you to do for your situation
[1:52:03] but if anybody desires prayer tonight we
[1:52:06] will pray with you um
[1:52:08] and God is still
[1:52:10] in the delivering business
[1:52:12] you're still in the healing business
[1:52:14] he's still saving
[1:52:17] if you need to be saved
[1:52:19] and we will pray with you tonight it's
[1:52:21] not as deep and complicated as people
[1:52:24] try to make it
[1:52:25] right but people say oh confess with
[1:52:27] your mom believe in your heart you'll be
[1:52:29] saved yeah that's true
[1:52:31] but when it's real it'll it'll start to
[1:52:34] have an effect
[1:52:36] but the devil believes
[1:52:38] and trembles at the word
[1:52:42] right but I ain't looking to see him in
[1:52:43] the rapture
[1:52:46] so you know people say oh you gotta do
[1:52:48] is believe oh yeah well your belief will
[1:52:50] be manifested through your life
[1:52:54] and your confession has the ability to
[1:52:57] bring even your body under subjection to
[1:53:00] the word of God Amen so let's just buy
[1:53:02] our heads and if anyone desires prayer
[1:53:04] the altar is open I'm sure
[1:53:08] um and the pastor and there are
[1:53:10] ministers here we will pray with you
[1:53:14] because God is able
[1:53:17] to do exceeding and abundantly above all
[1:53:20] that we can ask or even think
[1:53:24] father God we
[1:53:26] just come to the close Lord of this
[1:53:28] service
[1:53:30] but Lord we would not want to
[1:53:33] hinder anyone Lord that desires prayer
[1:53:37] for we be more than happy to pray with
[1:53:40] them
[1:53:42] for we know that your spirit is here
[1:53:44] Lord and where the spirit is Lord there
[1:53:46] is liberty liberty is freedom
[1:53:51] if you desire to be free from bondage
[1:53:53] you can be free tonight
[1:53:58] Lord many times we know that the
[1:54:01] greatest battle that has ever been
[1:54:02] fought is in our own mind Lord so as we
[1:54:05] endure those mind battles Lord we need
[1:54:08] to think on you
[1:54:10] for you say you will keep them in
[1:54:12] perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon
[1:54:15] thee
[1:54:17] many don't have peace many don't have
[1:54:20] rest Lord but you can give them rest
[1:54:24] for you say take my yoke upon you and
[1:54:27] learn of me
