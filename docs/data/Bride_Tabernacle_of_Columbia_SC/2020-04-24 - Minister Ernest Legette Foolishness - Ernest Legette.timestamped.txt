[21:19] on our own so god we're dependent on you
[21:22] thank you in the name of Jesus Christ we
[21:26] pray
[21:27] man God is good amen we want to look at
[21:33] the book of 1st Corinthians about God's
[21:35] grace
[21:35] first Corinthians 1st Corinthians 1 1
[21:58] first Corinthians 1 and we'll begin at
[22:00] the tempers
[22:09] first Corinthians one and ten and it
[22:13] reads now I beseech you brethren by the
[22:18] name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you
[22:20] speak all the same thing and that there
[22:22] be no divisions among you but that you
[22:24] be perfectly joined together in the same
[22:27] mind in the same judgment so it have
[22:30] been declared unto me of you my brother
[22:32] in' by then which are the household of
[22:34] Chloe that there are contentions among
[22:37] you now this I say that every one of you
[22:40] saith I am of Paul and I am Apollo's and
[22:43] I am Cephas and I am Christ is Christ
[22:45] divided was Paul crucified for you or
[22:48] were you baptized in the name of Paul I
[22:51] thank God that I baptized none of you
[22:53] but Crispus and Gaius
[22:55] lest any should say that I had that I
[22:58] had baptized in mine own name and I
[23:01] baptized also the household of stephanas
[23:03] besides i know not whether i baptized
[23:06] any other for christ sent me not to
[23:09] baptize but to preach the gospel not
[23:12] with the wisdom of words lest the cross
[23:15] of Christ shall be made of none effect
[23:17] for the preaching of the Cross is to
[23:19] them that perish foolishness but unto us
[23:22] which are saved it is the power of God
[23:25] for it is written I will destroy the
[23:28] wisdom of the wise and will bring to
[23:29] nothing to understand another prudent
[23:31] where is the wise where is the scribe
[23:34] where is the disputer of this world have
[23:37] not God made the foolish have not God
[23:41] made foolish the wisdom of this world
[23:44] for after that and wisdom of God the
[23:47] world by wisdom knew not god it pleased
[23:50] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[23:53] save them that believe for the Jews
[23:56] require a sign and the Greeks seek out
[23:59] the wisdom but we preach Christ
[24:01] crucified unto the Jews a
[24:03] stumbling-block and until the Greeks
[24:05] foolishness but unto them which are
[24:07] called both Jews and Greeks Christ the
[24:09] power of God and the wisdom of God
[24:11] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[24:14] than men and the weakness of God is
[24:16] stronger than men for you see your
[24:19] calling brethren how there many not wise
[24:20] men after the flesh not many my
[24:23] not many know more called but God have
[24:26] chosen the foolish things of the world
[24:29] to confound the wise and God have chosen
[24:32] the weak things of the world to confine
[24:35] the things which are mighty and base
[24:37] things of the world and the things which
[24:39] are despised hath God chosen yay and the
[24:44] things which are not to bring to nought
[24:46] things that are that no flesh should
[24:49] glory in his presence but of him are ye
[24:53] in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto
[24:57] us wisdom and righteousness and
[24:59] sanctification and redemption that
[25:01] according as it is written he that
[25:03] glorieth let him glory in the Lord may
[25:07] God add the blessed arena of his word
[25:10] tonight by God's grace I just want to
[25:13] minister to you for a moment and I
[25:15] entitled the sermon tonight foolishness
[25:18] amen foolishness no you know I like how
[25:23] you know Paul you know here here one
[25:27] thing he always was doing was breaking
[25:29] down about the power of God he kept
[25:32] talking about you know the power he kept
[25:35] saying what you think is his foolishness
[25:37] that's the thing guard has used to save
[25:40] us and we drawing power from it he says
[25:44] I didn't come just to preach to you just
[25:46] the wisdom of men's words but I come to
[25:49] preach to you in one place he's saying
[25:51] demonstration in power and that's what I
[25:54] believe a lot of times we we fail to see
[25:59] or we fail to to demonstrate even in the
[26:03] ministry is the power of God he said if
[26:06] I just came to you just in word only
[26:09] I made what Christ done all that just
[26:11] none of thing he says but you know to
[26:14] them that believe to those that don't
[26:16] believe it's a stumbling block but to
[26:18] you that believe it is the power so we
[26:21] find that you know even within ourselves
[26:23] you know God can't do nothing for you
[26:26] unless you believe first unless you
[26:28] believe but your belief or what you
[26:31] believe and what God and what God
[26:34] promised you you can drop I mean
[26:37] produced the power that's in the word so
[26:40] you know I was I was talking with a
[26:42] Muslim guy one night at work and he was
[26:46] saying you know if he was saying I don't
[26:47] know why you Christians you know believe
[26:49] that you know you getting baptized and
[26:53] just believing on Jesus that you'll be
[26:56] saved where do you where do you get that
[26:58] and I said the thing is you know I said
[27:00] God can only Jesus can only do for you
[27:03] if you believe in him I said even in his
[27:06] hole even in his own home when he was
[27:12] young growing up even in his own home
[27:13] when he came to preach he couldn't do
[27:16] many miracles there because the people
[27:17] didn't believe I said but to those that
[27:20] believed you know it's not just what we
[27:24] talked about what we heard but we've
[27:26] experienced the power of God and I said
[27:29] that same power that we've experienced
[27:32] you it's available to for you to
[27:35] experience but you got to first believe
[27:37] and I think God and that's what God has
[27:40] to do sometimes get us to the place to
[27:44] get us in to that point to where we
[27:46] believe so we know that like we said
[27:48] Paul kept dictating to the people or
[27:54] kept making emphasis on not just in the
[27:57] wisdom but in the power but one thing
[28:00] that he was showing the people that a
[28:03] lot of times you looking for God but
[28:06] you're looking for him in the wrong
[28:07] places
[28:08] you're looking for him in
[28:09] intellectualism you're looking for him
[28:11] in knowledge and wisdom you're looking
[28:13] for him in the biggest churches what God
[28:15] might not be in the biggest churches he
[28:17] said God always used the small things
[28:19] the foolish things and and that's where
[28:22] you'll find God and I thank God I says
[28:25] because what God has to do sometimes is
[28:29] is bring us back I believe to that
[28:31] childlike faith to that place the way we
[28:35] can just start taking guard and his word
[28:37] again just for what he says because I
[28:39] don't know about you but we at that
[28:41] place we at that time or that cycle I
[28:44] believe in time where we're gonna have
[28:45] to know more than just intellectualism
[28:47] more than just a good sermon
[28:49] wisdom but she's gonna have to be a
[28:51] demonstrator of the power and it's not
[28:54] that you demonstrate MIT but its Christ
[28:56] in you that's demonstrating the power so
[28:59] that's what the the ministry always does
[29:03] to try to point individuals into a
[29:05] personal experience with Christ that you
[29:08] can't go off my experience I can't go
[29:11] off your experience but you got to have
[29:13] an individual a relationship with God
[29:15] you got to know God for yourself because
[29:18] it'll show sooner or later it'll show up
[29:21] sooner or later further down the road is
[29:24] trials and tribulations call me to show
[29:26] just what type of each experience you
[29:28] had whether you was going off somebody
[29:30] else experienced or whether you received
[29:32] an experience for yourself so we look at
[29:35] here we're talking about foolishness I
[29:37] say the thing about it was here in the
[29:40] scriptures you can look and I believe
[29:42] Paul even had to deal with with these
[29:44] things that that you know man always
[29:46] stole I believe that he could outsmart
[29:49] God or either he thought that he didn't
[29:54] think he could outsmart him he thought
[29:56] that maybe in some cycles of time he
[29:58] didn't have the need of God because of
[30:02] his status in life for just how well
[30:07] he's doing but God knows and what God
[30:10] does a lot of times he has to break us
[30:12] back down and break us down to that to
[30:15] the place to where we come back to that
[30:17] understanding that we can't do nothing
[30:19] without God that we're only living and
[30:22] breathing is because he loud if he
[30:25] didn't allow these things then we
[30:27] wouldn't be able to be in the position
[30:29] or be in the place that we are tonight
[30:32] we're only here because of God is what
[30:35] God allowed so a lot of times he brings
[30:38] us I believe back to that place and I
[30:42] said and that's no matter you know how
[30:44] how you you are and how mighty you are
[30:46] God knows just what it takes to break
[30:48] you down
[30:49] God knows just what it takes they get
[30:52] you back on your knees again for say God
[30:56] knows he knows what it takes you know
[30:58] what I said a lot of times what he'll do
[31:01] he does those things because
[31:03] Oh all God won't out of each and every
[31:06] one of our lives it's for us to give him
[31:08] the glory foster to acknowledge him you
[31:13] know how much we go throughout the day
[31:15] without acknowledging Jesus Christ
[31:16] without acknowledging and and ensuring
[31:20] forth thankfulness you know in the
[31:22] scriptures if we could have read ahead
[31:24] in the scriptures Paul talked about how
[31:26] faithful God was he said God you know
[31:29] it's faithful in all things and that's
[31:32] what a lot of times we don't acknowledge
[31:34] we don't acknowledge that so what God he
[31:37] does sometimes it doesn't matter like I
[31:40] said how hard you are how mighty or God
[31:42] knows how to break you down God you know
[31:44] I think about Nebuchadnezzar and his
[31:48] condition and how God you know just
[31:51] allowing him to go in and he even called
[31:53] Nebuchadnezzar his servant at once how
[31:56] he went and brought judgment upon the
[31:57] nations of the earth but the Bible
[32:00] talked about a time that even in that
[32:02] when he was walking in and out viewing
[32:05] his kingdom and how he began to look and
[32:08] say look what I've done but God had
[32:10] already warned him that hey you know
[32:12] sooner or later you gonna get lifted up
[32:15] and he tried to warn them before he even
[32:18] got to that point but it is in a man we
[32:21] can get caught up sometimes and that's
[32:23] what God does guards tries to warn us
[32:26] many times let's get ready to come up
[32:27] the road he tries to warn us sometimes
[32:30] he put things before us that stop us
[32:32] before we go too far but what happens is
[32:35] many of times we don't take heed to the
[32:38] to what God is saying we don't take heed
[32:41] to the to the sort of stop signs to the
[32:43] road block sometime that God put before
[32:45] us and we go on in to that place and
[32:48] what happens God visits us sometimes
[32:51] with judgment but we know that you know
[32:53] like I said never kanessa his heart you
[32:55] know God lifts it up and the thing is
[32:57] God wanted to show him come on dad I'm
[33:00] not gonna share my glory with no hug
[33:02] come on I'm not gonna share my glory he
[33:05] said I'm the Lord and and I this is well
[33:08] this is all about him come on and it's
[33:11] not about you and what you can do but
[33:13] never kanessa had to realize that and
[33:16] even in
[33:17] you know when it came down to the end we
[33:19] know that the first thing he did when he
[33:21] came out of the curse that God put on
[33:24] him
[33:24] the Bible says that he began to he began
[33:27] to bless the Lord come on he began to
[33:30] say give glory and praise to the God
[33:34] Most High
[33:35] that's what he began to do when he came
[33:38] out of that come on but look look at
[33:40] your extreme measures that God had to do
[33:43] to get glory out of his life and I said
[33:46] even even with us as individuals
[33:49] sometimes what extreme measures that God
[33:53] has to go in our lives to get us to take
[33:57] the of focus and attention off of
[33:59] ourselves focus and attention offer your
[34:02] church offer this one or that one our
[34:05] offer your your status to do what - just
[34:08] get you back to a place the way you can
[34:10] start giving God glory again that kind
[34:13] of glory that he wants out of your life
[34:15] then I believe that but we're talking
[34:18] about all I would say the foolishness
[34:19] tonight God goes to extreme measures
[34:22] come on he goes to extreme measures to
[34:25] get glory I think about Moses and how he
[34:29] allowed Moses he waited years and years
[34:31] waited Moses to become 80 years old went
[34:33] to the extreme the way Moses was a man
[34:36] so weak you know in himself 80 years old
[34:39] well he even said I can't speak had no
[34:42] physical way of going down there and
[34:45] nothing physical about him that he would
[34:48] be able to look like to to bring about a
[34:51] change in that situation but God went to
[34:54] the extreme look like foolishness but
[34:57] that's what God what was it all about
[34:58] God wanted to do that and make it - that
[35:02] way so they came it was no kind of way
[35:04] that no man could glory out of it no man
[35:07] could get no glory in it only God
[35:09] Himself can get the glory out of it
[35:11] think about that and I think about how
[35:14] many examples in the scriptures I think
[35:17] about Gideon in the 300 come on oh I
[35:20] believe it was and he couldn't went
[35:22] witnessed with the 3000 he could've went
[35:23] with this but no God went to the extreme
[35:25] think about a little David facing
[35:28] Goliath God went to the extreme
[35:30] you say God what was it all for because
[35:33] God himself
[35:34] wanted to get the glory out of it and
[35:36] that's what it is we look at ourselves
[35:38] so much and say Lord oh not just to try
[35:43] to portray our humility but a lot of
[35:45] times God allows you know your failures
[35:48] to be exposed God allows you to see
[35:51] yourself as being insufficient God gets
[35:54] you to the place - sometimes you search
[35:56] and sometimes you're trying to figure it
[35:58] out but God don't seem like he opening
[36:00] the door don't seem like he revealing
[36:02] unto you but then when the time come God
[36:05] will put the words in your mouth God he
[36:07] keeps you sometimes like that
[36:09] to where you can stay humble and walk
[36:12] before him and you will know that the
[36:14] only way you can stand the way you
[36:16] standing it's only about the grace of
[36:17] God and we think about so many that's
[36:20] why I Paul I believe he can look at
[36:22] himself he can look at his
[36:24] insufficiencies he can look at the
[36:26] things that he's done in the background
[36:28] that he came from in the sin the sin or
[36:31] the chaos that he brought upon the
[36:33] Church of the Living God but then he can
[36:35] know that he can yield his cell to God
[36:38] in a way and only thing he only thing he
[36:40] could talk about was that Christ that
[36:42] was living in him that it was God that
[36:44] was doing the work he said if anybody
[36:46] you know I'm Richard I'm undone he said
[36:49] oh what a wretched man that I am now so
[36:51] you see I'm a prisoner for the Lord why
[36:54] because he learned how to yield himself
[36:56] to God he learned that the only the
[36:58] glory that was gonna come it was gonna
[37:00] be glory giving to God and I believe
[37:02] that tonight we look at even now Oh like
[37:06] I said the shape that the world is in I
[37:08] want to do it the UM read something that
[37:10] someone said it was just someone talking
[37:13] about the coronavirus and they were
[37:15] saying you know the virus outbreak it
[37:19] dictates when we can leave and the saga
[37:22] can continue isn't that extraordinary
[37:25] something is so small that we can't even
[37:28] see it but yet is keeping billions of
[37:31] people on lockdown it has closed borders
[37:34] it has families separated it has cost me
[37:38] for their jobs
[37:39] it has shut down businesses it keeps
[37:42] children out of schools
[37:43] and it dominates all of our conversation
[37:46] something seeming to be so small come on
[37:50] but what what God does you know
[37:53] sometimes we look and look at the world
[37:55] and look at great countries and look at
[37:58] a great doctors look at great a science
[38:01] and technology and and where we go into
[38:04] the moon and all these things but less
[38:06] the man says he says something this is
[38:08] extraordinary something this small did
[38:11] what it's got the whole world in in
[38:13] prison right now something this small is
[38:16] dictating to us where we can go got
[38:18] everybody billions on lockdown it costs
[38:21] you your job it's separated you from
[38:23] your families got the whole world shook
[38:25] something that small he said that's
[38:27] extraordinary but I think about it so
[38:29] when we look at you know a lot of times
[38:32] or we resting in impulse securities we
[38:36] resting on things that God can take
[38:39] something so small and shake it from
[38:42] underneath you just like that God they
[38:44] take something so small and turn the
[38:46] whole world
[38:47] you know sometimes upside down and we
[38:50] say we get back to the place the way all
[38:52] of our faults securities everything we
[38:55] thought that was secure
[38:57] come on we get back to that place the
[38:59] way we save God with the whole world
[39:01] fall apart your word is the only thing
[39:04] that's still solid your word is the only
[39:06] thing that is still keep us guard from
[39:09] falling apart and I believe that I was
[39:11] in prayer the other day just meditating
[39:14] on the Lord and thinking about these
[39:16] things and I said Lord you know even in
[39:18] your word it says heaven and earth will
[39:20] pass away but your word oh god it won't
[39:23] pass away I believe your word as Dave
[39:26] said it's forever settled in heaven you
[39:28] know it's no sure foundation that we
[39:30] have tonight outside of the Word of God
[39:33] outside of Christ himself there's no
[39:36] share foundation there's nothing solid
[39:38] that we can rest on but the Word of God
[39:41] tonight and I believe that but we find
[39:44] that here like we says they're talking
[39:46] about we're talking about foolishness
[39:48] I like how you know you know in the
[39:50] scriptures it says the foolishness of
[39:52] God is wiser than men in the weakness of
[39:55] God is stronger than men
[39:57] you know here in the here in the 17th
[39:59] verse you know he quoted a little but he
[40:03] was saying for Christ sent me not to
[40:04] baptize but to preach the gospel not
[40:07] with the wisdom of words lest the cross
[40:09] of Christ should be made none effect to
[40:13] you come on preach it
[40:16] Paul said I come to preaching not just
[40:19] in the wisdom the word cuz if I do that
[40:21] I'm taking I'm making a cross I'm not
[40:23] effect to you I'm taken away as he broke
[40:26] down later in the scriptures I'm taking
[40:28] away your Redemption I'm taking away
[40:30] your salvation I'm taking away your
[40:33] healing so I can't preach it to you in a
[40:36] way that it won't have a physical and a
[40:41] spiritual effect on your life but I
[40:43] gotta preach it in a way to where you
[40:45] can benefit from it if you ain't
[40:47] benefitting from it from the way that
[40:49] I'm preaching the gospel then it's
[40:51] killing you it ain't of no effect to you
[40:54] come on
[40:54] well he's saying in a short way to God
[40:58] you know we want to preach the gospel
[41:01] that that's real Lord we want to be able
[41:04] to to preach it in a way to way people
[41:07] can still be healed the way God I can
[41:10] bring you real again then God let me get
[41:13] down on my knees a little bit longer let
[41:15] me cry out until something happened God
[41:18] in the way when we preached it God
[41:20] helped me to learn how to get out of the
[41:22] way Paul said I got to preach it that
[41:25] way
[41:25] come on other than that I'll be just a
[41:28] Pharisee or sad you see he said so I
[41:31] ain't come to baptize you alone but I
[41:33] come to show you the power of God I saw
[41:36] I come to show you that Jesus Christ is
[41:39] the same yesterday today and forever no
[41:42] matter what the world is saying about
[41:44] him God is still real come on and that's
[41:47] how you know he was breaking it down and
[41:51] that's why I'm saying I said the thing
[41:53] is he said lest the cross should be made
[41:56] of none effect he goes on in 18 verse he
[41:58] says for the preaching of the Cross is
[42:01] to them that perish is foolishness come
[42:04] on he says but to us which are saved is
[42:08] the power of God
[42:10] come on we're preaching to you it seemed
[42:14] like what they call foolishness come on
[42:17] because to them they can't grasp when
[42:21] they see the cross or they when they
[42:23] vision across it can't do nothing fun
[42:26] but you and I that believe we're drawing
[42:29] power from it
[42:30] we don't just look at the cross and just
[42:33] quote what we know about it but we see
[42:35] it we take it personal we say God you
[42:39] hung there for me God you bled and died
[42:42] for me Lord it's personal
[42:45] hallelujah when it becomes personal you
[42:48] can draw from it I think they said it
[42:51] said that when the when the blood or was
[42:53] shed on Calvary that released God come
[42:56] on the life that was in that blood come
[42:59] on when he came out you know he was able
[43:01] to come back on you and I in the form of
[43:04] the Holy Ghost and it did what it gave
[43:07] us such a measure of God that we can
[43:11] draw power from it you know they think
[43:13] talking about the ocean you might not
[43:15] have a spoon but a spoonful of the ocean
[43:18] but the same chemistry that's in that
[43:21] spoonful that you got is in the ocean
[43:24] itself it's the same chemistry it's the
[43:26] same makeup even though it's only a
[43:28] spoonful is still the ocean and we look
[43:31] at it even within ourselves now we know
[43:33] Christ was the fullness of it but he
[43:35] gave you and I uh-uh or himself and we
[43:39] we can't even live it in a fullness but
[43:42] we've got the message so what he gave
[43:45] come on but nevertheless it's God
[43:47] himself
[43:48] it's not just something we make it up
[43:51] but this is the chemistry you got it the
[43:54] life that sent you is God himself come
[43:57] on it's the michaelis it's God himself
[43:59] and if God is in you then all things are
[44:02] possible all you've got to do is believe
[44:04] come on
[44:06] but we find that he says for he says
[44:10] with the preaching of the Cross to them
[44:12] that perish
[44:13] you know it's foolishness but to us
[44:15] which are saved he said it's the power
[44:17] of God you know I began meditating on
[44:19] that I said what it is it's our hope
[44:22] it's our salvation
[44:24] come on it's our healing if Christ
[44:27] hadn't came and doing what he did
[44:29] you know all of us we wouldn't had no
[44:32] way of escape we wouldn't have had
[44:34] nobody to to stand before us on that day
[44:38] but now you know about the grace of God
[44:41] and in which we stand
[44:42] we got the ability to be able to stand
[44:45] even though our sins are scarlet we know
[44:49] that the blood of Jesus has made him
[44:51] white as snow we can stand boldly now
[44:54] before the throne of grace and ask for
[44:56] help mercy and grace in the time of need
[44:59] because why because all what he's done
[45:02] that's a told that don't believe it's
[45:04] foolishness this ain't something that
[45:07] you can make up in your mind or just
[45:09] dream about but it's got to become so
[45:11] real I believe to you that it does
[45:14] something for you it brings the power of
[45:16] God down in your life and that's what
[45:19] you know we're talking about even here
[45:21] tonight I says that's what the the
[45:23] shedding of his blood did it it released
[45:25] God from where the blood of Bullock's
[45:27] bulls and goats could only you know just
[45:31] I'll give you a torment of just in
[45:34] year-to-year but the life that was in
[45:35] that blood can come back on the believer
[45:37] so every year you had to come back and
[45:38] make the same sacrifice but when Christ
[45:41] died it was once and for all what he
[45:44] done come on and that and we could we
[45:46] can't never I say we can never take away
[45:49] take away from it but why why week like
[45:53] we said we call it foolishness why a lot
[45:55] of times you try to you try to get
[45:58] people to understand come on that is not
[46:01] in your ability you know it takes away
[46:04] from the words out of your mouth I or
[46:07] what I can do or what we can do or what
[46:10] I have done it takes that word out of
[46:12] your mouth because it brings to you an
[46:15] understanding a revelation that you
[46:18] couldn't do nothing it was all what he
[46:20] done it was all what he's still doing in
[46:23] your life and what does that do that
[46:25] that takes that out of your life and I
[46:29] says what happens a lot of times when
[46:32] the people can't see it and that's why
[46:34] you know you may we miss God and so many
[46:38] ways
[46:38] we miss God because we're looking for
[46:40] him in the wrong places we're looking
[46:42] for him in the wrong kind of character
[46:45] leadership we're looking for the wrong
[46:47] things but we got to get back to the
[46:49] simplicity which is in Christ I find you
[46:52] know I was I was thinking about saying
[46:53] one thing I love I says you know one
[46:57] thing I love here in the scriptures how
[46:59] Paul and the 28th verse he began to save
[47:02] you know that it was looking at 27 verse
[47:05] he says but God have chosen the foolish
[47:08] things of the world to confound the wise
[47:10] and God hath chosen the weak things of
[47:12] the world to confound the things that
[47:14] are mighty and the base things of the
[47:16] world and the things which are despised
[47:19] God is chosen how God the Bible he says
[47:26] here that the things that are despised
[47:28] come on the weak things the things that
[47:31] are despised that's what God is chosen
[47:33] that's what God operates in but yet
[47:36] sometimes we missed it we can't see it
[47:39] because of where God
[47:41] I said where are we gonna find God that
[47:42] if you were where would you find out
[47:45] that it took me back in my mind you know
[47:48] testimony of me and uh brother Karl and
[47:50] how we were down in Orangeburg and how
[47:53] you know was out witness sinning we end
[47:56] up pulling up by our crack house and it
[47:58] was a riot in the back doing they what
[48:00] they were doing and it was a man you
[48:02] know he come from walking behind the
[48:03] house and he broke down in tears and and
[48:07] he began crying and he said y'all look
[48:09] at me he had a full suit on at the crack
[48:12] house Sunday afternoon when he had a
[48:14] full suit on at the crack house he said
[48:16] I got dressed to go to church this
[48:17] morning but I ain't never make it
[48:19] he said the drugs and any demons or the
[48:22] drugs had him had such a pool on him
[48:25] that he couldn't break free from it he
[48:27] got dressed
[48:28] he won't it delivers he won't God to do
[48:31] something for his life but the chains
[48:33] that he was in I believe come on some
[48:36] people sometimes they can't make it the
[48:38] boss house that's why God got to go to
[48:40] them that's why God had to go to certain
[48:43] places they're the people that wasn't
[48:46] welcome in a synagogue God had to go
[48:48] there come on it seems like foolishness
[48:50] what would you do
[48:52] fellowshiping with the people like that
[48:53] but God he chose the thing that the
[48:56] world rejected that the people didn't
[48:58] want to be around God chose to be around
[49:01] those people and he went there come on
[49:03] and I believe what we were talking to
[49:05] the man it did something so for us you
[49:08] know we begin to have prayer with the
[49:10] man right outside the crack house just
[49:12] praying with the man you know asking God
[49:16] to do something it brings about
[49:18] something your heart the the make you
[49:21] understand that you need a real gospel
[49:24] you need a gospel that's got power in it
[49:27] come on that'll break the people from
[49:29] the condition their lives area people
[49:31] won't help but they can't find help if
[49:33] you ain't piecing the gospel right they
[49:36] can't find help
[49:37] come on if you made it up not affect
[49:40] home you took the power away from it
[49:43] how do people gonna find help I said
[49:45] well guard people still need help today
[49:47] people still want to be delivered
[49:49] alcoholics still want to be delivered
[49:52] drug addict the prostitute still they
[49:54] want to be delivered can God be brought
[49:56] to the people I believe he can come on
[49:59] but it would be foolishness come on tell
[50:02] a man that God want to deliver you come
[50:05] on you don't try and rehab I think about
[50:07] my dad you don't try it at this you
[50:09] don't try to chew me come on now God
[50:11] want to do something with your life
[50:12] come on you don't try now like she says
[50:16] the preaching of the gospel that's how
[50:18] God chose the saying to the world is
[50:21] foolishness come on today's lecture -
[50:24] foolishness but you preached it in the
[50:26] right way and still power in it that's
[50:28] the way that God chose come on to
[50:31] deliver people and I believe that I
[50:33] always believe that's why I say God it's
[50:35] more about just talking but I believe
[50:38] that it's it's walking in his presence
[50:40] it's getting to a place you know even it
[50:44] even of the Pharisees and the scribes
[50:45] you know when Jesus was speaking you
[50:48] know a lot of what he was doing he was
[50:50] rehearsing the scriptures he was quoting
[50:52] and they said yeah we you know this man
[50:54] ain't saying nothing new but he says
[50:56] it's just a way nobody we never heard it
[50:58] the way he's saying it come on he was
[51:00] saying it the same thing but we never
[51:02] heard it like that come on how did they
[51:04] hear because it was Authority in it
[51:06] he was speaking like they say as one
[51:08] with authority and one with power come
[51:10] on you can preach the gospel but how how
[51:13] is it being heard come on you can
[51:16] witness my how's it being heard come on
[51:18] you can say the same thing that has been
[51:20] said before but how's it being heard I
[51:22] said God when they hear it doesn't have
[51:24] power in it doesn't have life in it is
[51:27] there something in it that's going wrong
[51:28] drone of God and that's what we want
[51:31] getting us back to the place why because
[51:34] we realize sometimes you realize
[51:38] physically within yourself you can't
[51:40] help come on the world can't help people
[51:43] need Christ people need a real
[51:46] experience with God they need God to do
[51:49] something real in their life they need
[51:51] the same Jesus that walked the shores of
[51:54] Galilee they need that same Jesus that
[51:57] stood at Lazarus grave they need that
[51:59] same Jesus come on then being in the
[52:02] tomb but he rose from the dead and he
[52:04] said it all power
[52:05] come on is given unto me we need that
[52:08] same Jesus they gave you a commission
[52:10] the go ye unto the world he says and
[52:13] preach the gospel he says he says these
[52:16] signs that shall follow them that
[52:17] believe they need the same Jesus they
[52:20] need the same you if you believe it the
[52:23] same way I believe that same Jesus come
[52:25] down on the scene today and that's what
[52:27] we need
[52:28] come on that same Jesus well we find
[52:30] that like it says too many it's
[52:33] foolishness but you look at you you look
[52:35] at a lot of things and I says you know
[52:38] one thing I says what is despised the
[52:42] things that's despised in the base world
[52:44] in the base of this world he said God
[52:46] have chosen and the things that are not
[52:48] you know he took things that are and
[52:52] that no flesh should glory in his
[52:54] presence God chose the weakest things
[52:57] you know God chose you because he knew
[53:00] you were weak God chose you because he
[53:03] knew that you weren't capable of doing
[53:05] the job but he done that he said that no
[53:08] flesh should glory in his presence and I
[53:10] thank God sometimes we measure ourselves
[53:13] by ourselves the Bible say that ain't
[53:15] wise come on but we should mark the
[53:18] perfect man which is Christ Jesus
[53:20] we're looking for God to do great things
[53:23] and do greater things in our lives we
[53:25] look out says what it is you know I
[53:27] thank God I thank God that he don't mind
[53:29] come on
[53:30] going to the street corner I thank God
[53:33] that he don't mind going to the places
[53:35] where nobody else won't go and I said
[53:38] that if that same if that God is in you
[53:40] would you go to the places nobody else
[53:42] wouldn't go would you go to the street
[53:45] corner would you go was you fellowship
[53:47] with those or sit down and talk it over
[53:50] with those that nobody else wouldn't
[53:52] come on because if that same Christ is
[53:54] in you then then that's what he would be
[53:57] doing so are you willing to go that
[53:59] extra mile come on it seems that way but
[54:02] a lot of times we're gonna be surprised
[54:04] I believe who made it and who didn't why
[54:10] because God looking down in the heart of
[54:13] man come on we're talking about the
[54:16] foolishness I said you know what we look
[54:18] at you know even God shows God shows
[54:22] even out of all the technology planning
[54:25] settles back up you know and all these
[54:27] things and the way the world has
[54:29] progressed we still in desperate need of
[54:32] His grace we still in everyday we still
[54:36] in desperate need of the mercy of God
[54:37] and more and more I believe that the
[54:41] mercy of God god bless you know the Lord
[54:52] amen God chose the foolish things of the
[54:56] world to confound the wise
[54:58] it was foolishness to save them that was
[55:02] lost the cross amen I believe it's the
[55:07] same gospel amen and I believe that
[55:10] blood has not lost its power as of yet
[55:13] and I believe if we preach they meant
[55:17] the same gospel to get the same results
[55:20] they meant praise God the Bible gave us
[55:24] something to save them that a loss amen
[55:27] he said preach the gospel preaching in
[55:29] season out of season he meant preach it
[55:32] if the hidden preacher that they don't
[55:34] yeah he meant the same word he meant God
[55:38] word has never lost its power
[55:41] he said heaven and earth will pass away
[55:43] but God word it's going to stand he
[55:46] meant with all this field God would
[55:48] never fail he meant somebody said well
[55:51] God didn't do what I thought the work
[55:53] should have done Amen I said the aim of
[55:56] God is faithful
[55:58] amen it's impossible for God to tell a
[56:01] lie
[56:02] Amen if God didn't do what you thought
[56:04] he should have done Amen I want you to
[56:07] know that God had a plan a mitten in the
[56:11] mind of God Amen he said your ways are
[56:14] not my ways and your thoughts are not my
[56:17] thoughts he meant God knew what he was
[56:20] doing Amen praise God sometimes he meant
[56:24] we find out he meant when the morning
[56:28] come in behind bar we understand it
[56:31] better by and by when the morning come
[56:34] sometimes because he meant we think God
[56:37] has failed us they meant God never fail
[56:40] Amen praise God God never make mistakes
[56:43] Amen because he is God hallelujah so it
[56:50] doesn't matter how folks he meant had
[56:52] looked at God and as though God did not
[56:55] do what he promised but he meant and God
[56:59] word was not effective and God word
[57:02] couldn't pay men our dreams and our
[57:06] hopes come to pass but I want you to
[57:11] know that God knows hallelujah praise
[57:18] God you ask for God to do what you want
[57:21] him to do and God does say men what he
[57:25] ordained before the foundation of the
[57:27] world and what he promised to do
[57:30] hallelujah sometimes God answers our
[57:34] prayers and somebody said God works in
[57:37] mysterious ways and wanders to perform
[57:41] God does sings in man don't
[57:44] then that God is doing it praise God God
[57:48] sometimes is doing it even while we're
[57:51] sleeping and God doing it and our
[57:55] failure God is still working he meant
[57:59] when it looked like he meant off he
[58:01] meant everything is the law says that
[58:04] the words that our minister Leggett was
[58:07] talking about earnest was talking about
[58:09] amen and look like a met God had failed
[58:12] Martha and Mary but God had a plan he
[58:16] meant one day met in the resurrection
[58:19] morning with death prison bars are
[58:21] broken he many will look Amen praise God
[58:25] and see that God had a hand
[58:27] they met sometimes God has a plan and
[58:30] God knows when I worked out his dive
[58:34] hallelujah
[58:35] well I've gone the last mile of the way
[58:38] they meant praise God when God said it's
[58:41] finished it's finished we thank God for
[58:46] the word today I was in Pride today and
[58:50] and I was going through save yourself
[58:56] amen Peter on the day of Pentecost he
[59:00] was telling the people save yourself
[59:02] when this untoward generation if it ever
[59:05] was an untoward generation I believe
[59:07] we're in that under ward generation and
[59:10] he said save yourself amen what what are
[59:15] you saying when Peter a mint was
[59:17] preaching that sermon on in the second
[59:20] chapter of Acts he said to him give all
[59:23] the prophets witness and extend that
[59:27] through his name whosoever believe on
[59:29] him shall receive remission of sin I
[59:31] want you to know in acts two he said
[59:35] they were pricked in their heart and
[59:38] said unto Peter and the rest of the
[59:39] Apostles men and brethren what shall we
[59:42] do
[59:42] he said repent and be baptized every one
[59:45] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[59:47] the remission of sins and you shall
[59:49] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[59:51] the promise is unto you and to your
[59:53] children and to them that AFOL even as
[59:55] many as the Lord our God shall call and
[59:58] many of the words it is testifying exalt
[1:00:00] saying see yourself save yourself from
[1:00:05] this untoward generation amen I want to
[1:00:10] know I want you to know those that saved
[1:00:12] themselves he made the same day they
[1:00:15] were added to them about 3,000 Souls how
[1:00:18] was it he meant they saved themselves
[1:00:21] even mama can't see you daddy can't save
[1:00:25] you
[1:00:26] grandma can't save you you got to save
[1:00:29] yourself he met praise God for this
[1:00:32] untoward generation you got to do it
[1:00:36] they met you got to be pricked in your
[1:00:39] heart as they said what must I do serve
[1:00:44] what must I do to be seen I want to know
[1:00:48] what I got to do you got to repair save
[1:00:52] yourself
[1:00:54] repair or perish amen it looked like no
[1:00:59] looked like a fool he made it look like
[1:01:03] he was crazy look like a modern man but
[1:01:07] God took the foolishness they meant no
[1:01:11] preaching to condemn the world one man
[1:01:14] with one massive condemn a whole world
[1:01:18] they meant praise God I believe as it
[1:01:21] was in the days of law and as the walls
[1:01:24] in the deeds of love that should it be
[1:01:26] oh yes I believe thou shalt being the
[1:01:30] day when the Son of Man is revealed I
[1:01:32] believe the same dots for the Bible said
[1:01:37] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:01:39] and forever if they rejected nor they
[1:01:43] reject the word today because these are
[1:01:47] the days they rejected him and praise
[1:01:50] God they just a with them to Sodom and
[1:01:53] tell him to come on out they may give
[1:01:56] Sodom space and he couldn't find 10
[1:02:00] praise God I wonder if God could find 10
[1:02:03] in America we can find 10 never repent
[1:02:07] they come out of Sodom
[1:02:10] come on
[1:02:11] conditioned women cutout of the world
[1:02:15] come back to God that he's five-ten and
[1:02:19] he said I'll spider city but it couldn't
[1:02:23] find pain in Sodom and Gomorrah God
[1:02:27] couldn't find ten already found in the
[1:02:30] deeds of know will hate souls brothers
[1:02:33] so there's somebody I want to be ready
[1:02:48] when Jesus call when they come I want to
[1:02:52] be ready what are you doing to prepare
[1:02:55] yourself save yourself
[1:03:16] praise God when the word is interpreted
[1:03:21] by your life
[1:03:23] praise God when the guard is
[1:03:27] demonstrating through you what's written
[1:03:29] in the Bible it's no longer in the pages
[1:03:33] his own two feet Jesus Christ walking in
[1:03:37] you
[1:03:38] amen Jesus Christ in you the hope of
[1:03:42] glory amen
[1:03:44] you are a man of demonstrating Jesus
[1:03:47] Christ that he's still alive they meant
[1:03:50] that he lives not a dad Jesus I mean
[1:03:54] Jesus had risen from the dead some folks
[1:03:58] said he he didn't do it
[1:04:00] they did but somehow they must justify
[1:04:04] me that something about you that's
[1:04:07] peculiar
[1:04:08] amen certain about you that 100 the
[1:04:15] world it's going crazy man and not all
[1:04:19] kind of sinful and filthy and ungodly
[1:04:21] stuff
[1:04:22] that's somebody that's a
[1:04:23] oh yes the same Jesus that the
[1:05:21] appearance the Bible said every eye
[1:05:24] shall see him even him that pierced him
[1:05:27] they got to see him one name I want you
[1:05:31] to know it you might not take your soul
[1:05:34] serious your walk with Christ it might
[1:05:37] be a little you know just taking a light
[1:05:42] your soul don't mean too much to you
[1:05:44] today your soul is not important now you
[1:05:48] don't value your eternal destiny amen
[1:05:51] you don't value you just looking at the
[1:05:55] knob your not knowing that one day is
[1:05:58] with the Lord as a thousand years and a
[1:06:01] thousand years is as one day
[1:06:03] that is an eternity they meant that way
[1:06:05] no they meant you can be eternally
[1:06:09] separated from God or you can be with
[1:06:12] God in eternity but friends God I want
[1:06:16] you to know he meant God calling
[1:06:18] somebody calling somebody a meant that
[1:06:21] he foreknew that he saw in his mind
[1:06:24] before the foundation of the world and
[1:06:27] God called you got to have some in that
[1:06:30] because the deep call to the deep and
[1:06:33] God knows where your

[1:08:14] room will you go again servants of God

[1:11:05] but I'm looking to their unseen I'm
[1:11:09] looking by faith and I got hope that God
[1:11:12] made a promise then he's coming back
[1:11:15] again and here I can hold a mint hold on
[1:11:20] to what God said amen no matter how many
