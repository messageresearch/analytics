[Music] and you got to say amen amen first corinthians chapter 13 and it reads though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity i am become as a sounding brass or tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envy is not cherry vaunted not itself and is not puffed up does not behave unseemly seek his not her own and is not easily pro provoked thinking no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in truth bearing all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is part shall be done away amen god bless the reading of his word may be seated tonight we'd like to speak on a little topic um called have you fallen in love yet have you fallen in love yet just this book in the first corinthians chapter 13 it speaks about charity and in the seventh verse it says it beareth all things and believeth all things hope with all things endure all things and lord was working on me have you fallen in love yet and there are many things in the bible many scriptures and things that point to the love that that that god bless his servants and people in the bible and the love that we should have for god and it's a love that is not partial it's not something that we look at and we understand that this love it it bears all things it takes on it takes on a life it takes on a form for itself and jesus he seeing that easter was sunday it came to my attention how god loved us so much that he went to the cross and he died for us for just a thought and it was it was it was powerful but it started me to ask the question to myself have i fallen in love yet have i fallen in love with god so much that things don't matter that things can pass away things can move on things could happen but it's never wavers and it never shakes who i am and it's building up a life and building up a testimony of the love that i have for him in the let's turn to the book of job job chapter 13. on the story of job job was a job was a man that i think sometimes i think and i say god put stories in the bible just for us just for us to see that there are things that everything ain't sunshine and rainbows sometimes there are hardships and trials that you go through and job was one of those stories that he put in there and they say that job was the first book of the bible and in job chapter 13 and um but before we go there we know the story of job how he went through he went through so much in his life he went from owning land owning cattle having a big family everything seemed to be going right with job and everything was and the devil came to god and he said god the only reason that he's serving you only reason that he loves you is because you're doing so much for them you're doing this you're doing that and you you got to head your protection around them and god god knew who joe was and how much love he had for him so he said all right go ahead and test them so god allowed the devil to take his land god allowed the devil to take his his cattle take his sheep take his ox and take take his camels and then god and then the devil probably came back to god and said you ain't let me do enough you keeping that hedge around them so god said okay just don't take his life and he said so the devil went back and then he killed his family and then he caused his wife to turn against job and then in chapter 13 and verse 15 joel goes on to make the statement he says though though he slayed me yet will i trust in him but i will maintain my own ways before him he also shall be my salvation for a hypocrite shall not come before him and job was saying here to his friends he said though god put me through all this though i've been through so much though i've i got boils on my skin and it looked like i'm gonna die though he slayed me i'm gonna trust him because he knew that he had that love for god that love that passes all understanding that he knew that god was and it came to my attention the other day i was thinking i was like job was the first book of the bible he didn't have a reference book he couldn't look back at what god was going to promise him he didn't know that god was god was going as the scripture said supply all his needs he just knew that he said naked i came into this world naked i shall return so he knew that god what he trusted so much in god and loved him so much that he was willing to he would knew that if everything goes away i never i'll never leave god i'll never turn away from him and that's the love that i think that that sometimes i look and i ask myself do i have that type of love do i have that type of love towards my father for towards my fellow man because the bible says as you do to the least one of these you've done it unto me so it doesn't matter who it is and and he goes on and he says in the scripture job says though you slayed me i will trust you which means that i even though i'm going through all of this i'm never going to wave and waver in the love that god has given me and i looked at that same love you see in the new testament it was the love that jesus had when he died on the cross for us it was a love that when he went there he just we were just thoughts in his mind generations in time that were coming in the future he only knew that we were there and even he said he knew what he was about to go to through and he said father if this if you allowed this cup to pass but not my will let thy will be done because his love for you and me i think one songwriter said he said only love held him there on the cross he could have called ten thousand angels to come to his rescue but only love held him there on the cross and i think about that love how strong that love was how powerful that love was and he knew that he was gonna he was gonna have love for all my sins for all my iniquity he was to pass over that and still love me enough to save me still die for me to shed his blood to go through to get to get the net get the whips on his back and the thorns in his head and hang on a cross to die for me he knew he knew that he was going to what he was going to go through but still he loved me so much he went through that for me and even i think of the story of joseph joseph and his brothers between genesis 37 those are chapters in the bible but joseph he loved his he still showed love towards the ones that sold him into slavery the ones that despised him the ones that were jealous of him he still showed that love to him and he recognized that it wasn't his will it wasn't his plan if he could have chosen easier route to get where he needed to be he would have if he could have chose a different pathway he would have but because of because of the he recognized that all that he had been through that they were still they were still the ones and god had placed him in that position for a reason so he loved his family when he saw them again now he put him through some tests because he put him through a little test here and there but he recognized that god only brought me here is by the grace of god i only made it here i took god took me through these things but it was all building character it wasn't about well i'm going through this so i should give up it wasn't about that this isn't i don't see how that's going to work out he loved he loved god in spite of he loved him in spite of what he was going through and i think about the prophet of god how he talks about his life story when he um when he when he lost his he lost his first wife and he lost his child with them within weeks of each other and what a powerful what hurtful thing that was for him but he said and how he came out of it and god had to take him beyond the curtain of time to see that they were still there they were in a better place than where he is now and i and i looked at it and i said that's the love of god lord loved his servant so much that he allowed him to see he allowed him to take him before him sometimes you don't know why you go through certain things you don't understand why certain things happen you question you question your path you question god but in spite of that you still have to love him because he loved you so much that he brought you here and he gave you opportunity one on one one of my friends he always says you know what one of the most powerful things you have is your will because god put you on earth he gave your will your will to even reject him you can't even reach after all he did for you some people still reject god but god put us sometimes i think where would i be if god hadn't placed me in this specific place in this specific kind and sometimes you you think maybe i should i would have been better in this time or i would have been better with this so i would have been better with that but god knew exactly what you needed he loved you so much that he put you in the position that you are in because he knew that's what it was going to take to get you to where you needed to be he looked at you look at that and you you think back and you say well god sometimes you can't see why you go through things until years later when you look back over you see you see it and you say oh now i recognize why i had to go through that now i see why this happened and then sometimes you think back and you say oh god thank you for sparing me because i could have been out there i could have done a whole lot of things but only the love and the grace of god and his mercy that kept me from from being where i should have been and paul in the book actually he says acts 21 i'll just turn real quick but you don't have to acts 21-13 he says paul came to the conclusion paul came to the conclusion that he had got arrested he got arrested and he was defending his case in jerusalem and chapter and verse 13 21-13 paul anson said what mean you to weak or break or break my heart for i am not i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at truth for the name of jesus of the lord jesus christ paul loved god so much that he was ready to die for him he realized how much god had done for him he had turned his whole life around even though paul grew up he grew up with a stellar background he got taught under the chief of the pharisees he he spoke many languages paul was some people say super super intelligent but sometimes god had god had to humble him and bring him back down and on the road to damascus he said saul saul why persecute his doubt me god loved him so much god could have let him keep going he could have let him keep going on that path and many people would have said with a call paul's path that he was headed on the road that he was headed on success many people would have seen that as this is what we call we define as success but god loved him so much that he stopped he pau he said no paul you you're not doing what what i want you to do you're not and paul said he said all the things that he had learned all the things that he had achieved he said it profited me nothing god loved him so much that he he stopped paul and made him realize that you're only here because of my love for you and my grace for you and he got to the point paul loved god so jesus so much that he said he said he said but for i am ready not to be bound only but but to die and it makes me it made me question myself and said am i ready do i love god that much that i understand what's my path and where i'm going and i understand what's the what's that next level what's that next level where where am i headed but do i love you enough to trust you god do i love you that much that i can trust you you can bring me into where you want me to be at a certain point you love and then you trust one once you trust god in such a powerful way it moves you to do things that you never thought that you would do it makes you it makes you sometimes go out of what you say my boundaries what what i'm used to because you love god so much that you trust him you trust that he has everything in control you trust that he he'll provide for you he'll take care of you sometimes you don't know why how things are gonna happen but you love god so much that god god whatever whatever your will is for my life whatever my path that i should take lord i'll trust you and he said so i asked the question have you fallen in love yet because love even though sometimes i tell people all the time as i say that i went to school and i i went to school enjoying what i did but when i came out i fell in i was in love with it and sometimes that didn't mean that i didn't have my butts in the road that didn't mean that everything was going straight in the path was wonderful and lovely and it was all sunshine and rainbows sometimes it was hard sometimes you failed sometimes you had to understand you had to get knocked down to get back up again and improved and made and made that it made that love stronger it made that love more powerful and it made you want to continue to go on even though it wasn't always pretty it wasn't always always fun and all always people didn't always have a smile on their face well i didn't always have and sometimes it was stressful but that but it didn't make me want to give up i wanted to press on because there was a love there there was something that was burning inside that wanted me to go further wanted me to go deeper it was that love love for what i was what i wanted to do and what and people came and told me you should have done this or you should change this or change that but it's when you know god and you trust them and you put your put your faith in them and then and you love them it causes you to go on further it causes you to push forward and say god i don't know how this may end but i love you and i trust that you that you got everything in control so i asked a question i said have you fallen in love yet because sometimes you're going to hit those bumps in the road you're going to hit those potholes those sinkholes and say and look and you're going to say to yourself what am i doing here but that if you have love if you have that true love for god and you have that that that that deep down in your heart that god i love you so much that i trust that you're gonna have everything in control you'll keep on you'll you'll pray your power through you may hit your bumps in the road but you'll keep going because you know that only love held him there and it kept him it kept him on that cross for you and me and it kept him there so that we had this opportunity to say lord i love you we have this opportunity to come and we can worship him we had this opportunity to come together to to be in the presence of one another and say lord we want to come together and give you all the honor give you all the praise and lord and say that i love you lord i love you jesus
