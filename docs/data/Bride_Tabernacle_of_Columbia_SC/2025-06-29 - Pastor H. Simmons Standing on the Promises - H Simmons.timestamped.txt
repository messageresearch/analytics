[33:52] God bless you. God bless. It's been a
[33:54] long time for this song. So if I forget,
[33:56] y'all help me.
[34:00] Though the storm
[34:02] keeps on raing in my life.
[34:12] And sometimes it's hard to tell the
[34:17] night from day.
[34:24] Still that hope that lies within
[34:29] is reassured
[34:35] as I keep my eyes upon the dead. ensure
[34:42] I know he'll lead me safely to that
[34:48] blessed
[34:50] place he has prepared.
[34:59] But if
[35:01] the storms
[35:04] don't see
[35:12] and if the wind
[35:14] keeps on blowing
[35:17] in my life,
[35:20] my soul
[35:24] has been
[35:27] anger.
[35:29] in
[35:32] the Lord.
[35:37] And though the storm keeps on raing in
[35:43] my life,
[35:46] y'all help me sing. And sometimes it's
[35:50] hard to tell the night from there.
[35:58] But still that hope that lies within
[36:04] is reassured.
[36:10] As I keep my eyes upon the dead shore, I
[36:17] know he'll lead me safely to that
[36:23] place. He has
[36:27] prepared.
[36:32] But
[36:34] if the storm
[36:37] don't see
[36:41] and just in case the wind
[36:46] it keeps on
[36:48] blowing
[36:50] in my life,
[36:52] my soul,
[36:57] my soul's got an anger
[37:04] in the Lord.
[37:09] in the Lord.
[37:14] I realize
[37:17] that sometimes
[37:19] in this life,
[37:22] we're going to be told
[37:25] by the ways and the current that it
[37:29] seems so fierce.
[37:34] But in the word of God, I
[37:40] got an anchor.
[37:44] It keeps me stead
[37:47] and unovable
[37:49] in this word of God.
[37:56] But
[37:58] the storms
[38:01] don't see.
[38:05] And just in case the wind
[38:09] it keeps on
[38:12] blowing in my life.
[38:16] My soul,
[38:20] my soul's got an anchor
[38:24] in
[38:27] in the Lord.

[43:48] bondage and putting some things out here
[43:50] to making the world almost uh it's going
[43:53] to be almost impossible to live in a
[43:55] world like this full of chaos and
[43:57] confusion and oh, it's a it's it's
[44:00] getting wicked and wicer.
[44:02] Amen. The Bible says evil men and

[52:20] tender plant, and as a root out of dry
[52:22] ground.
[52:24] Isn't that right?
[52:26] Oh,

[52:50] opportunity to come into the kingdom.

[52:58] I got to think about this. Oh, if I had
[53:01] $100 bill and you had to think about it,
[53:03] I just keep my $100.
[53:05] Some of y'all $100 don't mean nothing. I
[53:07] had to go up to $500 for some of y'all
[53:10] cuz $100,
[53:13] it's like giving a child a dollar.
[53:16] Y'all got so much money to $100 mean a
[53:20] lot to me, but I mean it ain't valuable
[53:23] to y'all. Y'all got so much. But $500
[53:27] might might make you more. But anyway,
[53:31] yeah, I was over in uh Jamaica, over in
[53:34] Africa sometime, and I would give them a
[53:36] $100 bill. Oh Lord, you ought to see the

[53:50] in the value of what you have given.
[53:53] Jesus said, "I'm going to take you out
[53:56] of Egypt and I'm going to take you to I
[53:58] mean, uh, God said, I'm going to take
[54:00] you out of Egypt and I'm going to take
[54:01] you out of bondage, but I got something
[54:03] I'm going to replace it with."
[54:06] God. Amen. Amen. If he he wants you to
[54:08] give up sin, he wants you to give up the
[54:11] things of the world. Well, God has
[54:13] something better than what you Amen.
[54:16] holding on to.
[54:18] God got something better for you
[54:21] than what you're holding on to. You
[54:23] don't have to keep holding on to
[54:24] something. Amen. Praise God. That ain't
[54:26] going to do you good, but it's going to
[54:28] cause you to get worse.

[54:48] with. But it's got to be valuable. The
[54:51] word of God has to become valuable to
[54:54] you. Amen. It has to mean something to
[54:57] you.

[55:13] controvers but he's he he's promising
[55:16] you know I'm going to give somebody a
[55:17] million dollars.
[55:19] Amen. So you look at hey it's a
[55:22] possibility that I can get this million
[55:24] right. But here God is offering you
[55:27] something worth more than a million
[55:29] dollars.
[55:31] He said if you repent and be baptized in
[55:33] Jesus Christ's name that you shall
[55:36] receive the gift. Amen. You don't have
[55:39] to work for it. I'm going to give it to
[55:41] you. Amen. Amen. You shall receive the
[55:44] gift of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And when I

[1:02:50] Why? because the knowledge had of their
[1:02:53] understanding have not been enlightened.
[1:02:57] You can have something but if you don't
[1:02:59] know what you got, you sure ain't going
[1:03:01] to use it. That's right. Praise God. God
[1:03:04] give you the whole supermarket and you
[1:03:06] going through scarcity scared to pick up
[1:03:08] a few canned goods cuz God done give you
[1:03:11] the whole store.
[1:03:13] He said, "Well, I don't know. I think I
[1:03:16] just get a little bit of this and a
[1:03:19] little bit of that." And then you
[1:03:21] wonder, well, I don't know. And see,
[1:03:24] that's how people do the kingdom. God
[1:03:27] let you come in the kingdom. He say,
[1:03:28] "All things are yours." You said, "Well,
[1:03:34] let me check it out first. Maybe I get a
[1:03:36] little this and a little of that." But
[1:03:39] all the you know, you but but if you
[1:03:40] know the whole store blown to you, you
[1:03:42] can say, "Well, let me just see what I'm
[1:03:44] gonna get today." Amen. Amen. This this
[1:03:47] old supermarket blown to me. Let me just

[1:04:26] it's a gift.
[1:04:29] And everybody don't want to receive the
[1:04:33] gift that God gave us. His son
[1:04:38] Jesus Christ was God's gift to us.
[1:04:42] But everybody don't receive
[1:04:45] the gift.
[1:04:47] And what God gives you in return, if you
[1:04:50] receive him, he gives you eternal life.
[1:04:53] The gift of the wages of sin is what?
[1:04:57] But the gift of God is what? Eternal
[1:05:00] life. Eternal life. And God gives you
[1:05:03] eternal life. But some folks say,
[1:05:07] it's just just like the young rich
[1:05:08] ruler. He went away what? Sad. Sad.
[1:05:11] because he wanted to hold on to this
[1:05:13] world, this life. He I mean, cuz he had
[1:05:16] a lot in this life. He was rich. He was
[1:05:18] a ruler. He He walked away because God
[1:05:21] said, "I want you to give it up and give
[1:05:22] it to the poor." You say, "Uhuh, I ain't
[1:05:25] know that." And some folks say, God say,
[1:05:28] "You ain't you ain't you you're not
[1:05:30] rich, but you got a little pride in
[1:05:31] yourself and and and you want you want

[1:06:46] than what they had.
[1:06:48] But you see, most of them turn down
[1:06:50] their inheritance.
[1:06:54] They turn down their blessing. What God
[1:06:56] promised them, they turn it down. Same
[1:06:58] way folks do today. They turn down the G
[1:07:02] because they and and they come back and
[1:07:05] talk about God, I tried, Lord, and the

[1:07:40] failing you and preaching failing you
[1:07:42] and so you know different one but God
[1:07:45] ain't never fail.
[1:07:48] Well, I just stopped going to church
[1:07:50] because of some sensor in church. I just
