[44:52] willing father let you know
[44:55] amen give give up your sins and let him
[44:58] in that ought to be my
[45:02] subject okay uh Matthew 24 it says and
[45:09] three and as he sat upon the mountain of
[45:13] ol of the disciples came unto him
[45:15] prively or privately saying tell us when
[45:19] shall these things be and what shall be
[45:22] the sign of thy coming and of the end of
[45:25] the world may God bless you read this
[45:26] word you may be
[45:31] seated I said if if it's any
[45:34] time that is the approprate time to talk
[45:39] about the end of the world when you look
[45:40] at what's going on over in
[45:43] Haiti and what's going on on in
[45:48] Israel and uh Ukraine and around the
[45:53] world seem as though people have gone
[45:55] mad
[45:59] and there's no safe
[46:03] place I believe
[46:06] that they said years and years ago that
[46:09] it was 1 minute to
[46:12] midnight and if it was I mean three
[46:14] minutes to midnight and if it's been
[46:17] three minutes to midnight
[46:19] then I think we're closer now than we
[46:22] ever been since the world
[46:25] began
[46:27] the
[46:28] end of the
[46:31] world are we
[46:36] there how many of you think we're at the
[46:43] end somebody say not me don't let it be
[46:48] because I ain't ready to go nowhere so
[46:50] y'all hold
[46:52] up we can't God has a time
[46:55] now and when God's on
[46:58] time here
[47:04] come as we read in Acts one we're at the
[47:09] end of the
[47:11] world I was going to go and read further
[47:14] in Matthew but acts
[47:19] one and seven it
[47:21] says we were dealing with the double
[47:24] portion we need a double portion to get
[47:26] out of here
[47:28] we need not just oil in our lamps but we
[47:31] need oil in our
[47:34] vessel we need more than just coming to
[47:39] church just saying I
[47:43] believe we need a double portion we
[47:48] need a double portion of God's
[47:51] anointing his
[47:55] spirit they had they became
[48:00] drunk they were so full of the spirit to
[48:02] they couldn't even walk
[48:04] right and people thought they were full
[48:06] of new
[48:08] wine I I think we needed a
[48:12] stagger drunken
[48:14] experience we need to get
[48:17] drunk so many times people have come to
[48:21] church and they could out get out I mean
[48:23] they just were so full of the spirit
[48:26] till they just couldn't howly walk they
[48:27] couldn't drive back home and all of
[48:30] that when the last time you seen the
[48:33] good Holy Ghost meeting where the people
[48:35] couldn't even drive back home it was so
[48:38] full of spirit and
[48:41] tears you know one of the first things I
[48:45] saw when the individuals receive the
[48:48] Holy Ghost all the
[48:49] days and I was back in Progressive and
[48:53] we prayed with people for the Holy Ghost
[48:57] I their first response when they
[49:00] received the Holy
[49:02] Ghost All Through the
[49:04] Ages I can go back over 50 years or
[49:09] more and people that receive the Holy
[49:11] Ghost one of the first things they
[49:19] did just think about
[49:22] it just think about what you think they
[49:25] did the first thing they did when they
[49:27] received the Holy
[49:34] Ghost I see my
[49:36] daddy seen different ones come in and we
[49:39] pray with them and I seen God just
[49:42] filling with his Spirit power of God
[49:48] all I wonder what you do when you
[49:50] receive
[49:55] it
[49:59] people that I've seen they cry with joy
[50:01] tears of
[50:05] joy you could see the tears coming down
[50:09] from their eyes with so much
[50:13] joy you know you said Brothers Don't Hug
[50:16] the sisters and all of that because we
[50:19] don't do that
[50:21] here one of the first
[50:25] things was a brother brother or a
[50:28] sister they begin to hug
[50:31] everybody just C hugging everybody I
[50:35] love you I love you love you I love you
[50:38] I love you I love you this I mean just
[50:41] the love of God just come all over they
[50:43] just love
[50:45] everybody just love
[50:48] everybody it's just full of the love of
[50:51] God they feel that presence that love
[50:56] and they just
[50:58] just this love everybody I see him walk
[51:02] around just crying and loving
[51:06] everybody now people seem as though they
[51:09] say well I receed the Holy
[51:13] Ghost the Bible says the Holy Ghost is
[51:16] the love of God sheded abroad in our
[51:20] hearts you become so in love with God
[51:25] and you just
[51:27] if you had any enemies you wouldn't even
[51:29] know it because there so much love in
[51:33] you you just
[51:35] love
[51:38] everybody I believe we need
[51:40] another
[51:43] experience where we love
[51:48] everybody you can love your enemies then
[51:51] because it's just God just God just the
[51:54] glory to God all over you
[51:59] another
[52:00] thing when you receive the Holy
[52:03] Ghost somebody says you don't even want
[52:05] to kill an
[52:08] ant you don't want to kill a musquito
[52:11] yeah I mean you
[52:13] just I I mean it's just it's just a
[52:16] wonderful
[52:18] experience if you have a received that
[52:21] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[52:24] Ghost it's so wonderful it's so so
[52:28] powerful you feel uh somewhat Invincible
[52:32] you know I wanted to go out
[52:33] and lay hands on people and see the
[52:37] Miracles and signs I I experien
[52:41] something that real I wanted toest it
[52:45] God you know God is so good to me so
[52:47] real to me I know I had a life changing
[52:51] an
[52:52] experience I know something I I knew I
[52:55] was changed I I knew I knew I had what I
[52:59] asked God
[53:01] for walked out the door and look like I
[53:05] was in a new
[53:07] world the world had changed it was so
[53:10] bright
[53:11] outside I said everything is just
[53:16] different in other words my eyes have
[53:19] become open to the love of
[53:21] God I was at
[53:25] peace being so
[53:27] young so in love with God and having
[53:31] that
[53:34] experience that's an experience that I
[53:36] never wanted to lose and I I haven't
[53:39] lost it
[53:41] yet somebody said I love him more
[53:45] now as life is progressed I love him
[53:50] more because he said I'll never what
[53:53] I'll never leave you neither will I what
[53:56] forsake you a god that is has emptied
[54:01] himself or poured himself into
[54:04] you he's become so real to
[54:10] you everywhere you go he's with you he's
[54:14] in you everything you
[54:18] do sometimes you get a little grieved
[54:20] because sometimes look like we get a
[54:23] little Amnesia we don't know you know
[54:26] why we respond and do the things is
[54:29] because
[54:30] we are not
[54:33] in a consecrated in a prayer
[54:37] mood he's with us but we always got to
[54:42] recognize his
[54:44] presence we got to recognize when the
[54:47] Holy Spirit has lifted off
[54:49] us recognize when his presence is
[54:53] gone and recognize how much more we want
[54:56] his presence
[54:58] by so that takes
[55:01] repentance that takes confession it
[55:03] takes God I want you back in my
[55:07] life I need your presence
[55:10] back do you experience it every now and
[55:13] then maybe I get busy doing things going
[55:16] and oh worldly business and things that
[55:19] you have to take care of life and
[55:22] sometimes you're so busy you just pray a
[55:24] little bit a little while and jump back
[55:26] up and then things are you know you're
[55:29] back in then all of a sudden you say oh
[55:32] goodness his presence is not here like
[55:36] it ought to
[55:39] be got on my knees this morning early
[55:42] when I got out here I started praying
[55:45] and you know the presence
[55:47] come his presence is
[55:50] here I to consecrate the place since the
[55:53] builders were in here I Lord let the
[55:57] Holy Ghost move let the power of God be
[55:59] here for the service this
[56:02] morning I want to see you move let the

[1:08:20] home we spent our time here getting
[1:08:23] prepared to go home
[1:08:26] we're only here for a short time our
[1:08:28] home
[1:08:29] is
[1:08:32] Eternal We'll never have to cry no
[1:08:36] more never have to be in pain no more no
[1:08:39] more sadness no more
[1:08:42] sorrow but we'll be
[1:08:45] home not worried about the demons and
[1:08:48] the devils and somebody shooting
[1:08:50] somebody killing somebody uh uh need
[1:08:53] never need a doctor never need a lawyer
[1:08:55] you never need a
[1:08:59] friend but we have somebody that's going
[1:09:02] to be with us
[1:09:05] always I wonder how it feels it must
[1:09:08] have feel somewhat like you when you
[1:09:11] experience the holy ghost power and
[1:09:14] you're in heaven and all the glory of
[1:09:15] God if everybody in here could just just
[1:09:19] say oh Lord let me just love everybody
[1:09:23] just let me experience that love that
[1:09:26] that the kind of love Jesus had for us
[1:09:30] God let me experience that love can I
[1:09:33] feel it can I experience it can I have
[1:09:36] that kind of love Lord I I you know I
[1:09:40] don't want no you know fleshly type love
[1:09:44] I want the love of God can I experience
[1:09:47] it
[1:09:48] because just think the atmosphere of
[1:09:51] Heaven it it would be Sublime
[1:09:56] the prophet said beyond the curtain of
[1:09:58] time he said you know I cannot I cannot
[1:10:02] describe it the kind of love that was
[1:10:07] beyond that if we step over in that
[1:10:09] other dimension and see we tasted when
[1:10:13] we get the Holy Ghost we're tasted of
[1:10:15] that love we're tasted of that joy we
[1:10:19] tasted of that other
[1:10:21] world the place where we're gone we
[1:10:24] tasted that
[1:10:26] and we won't give you can give me a a 10
[1:10:29] billion dollars a trillion dollars I I
[1:10:31] wouldn't I wouldn't trade what I've
[1:10:33] tasted for
[1:10:35] that because it's not nothing in this
[1:10:38] world can
[1:10:39] compare to the love that God gives to
[1:10:43] them that would just only say Lord I
[1:10:46] accept it I receive it I want it
[1:10:49] amen I want that kind of
[1:10:52] love God I I I want your oh God I need

[1:28:39] love of God there's nothing there's not
[1:28:41] a greater love that you can experience
[1:28:44] than the love of God the love of God of
[1:28:46] of compassion the love of God to be able
[1:28:49] to bring us through the things that we
[1:28:50] need to go through and know enough to
[1:28:52] get us saved amen that's God's love amen
[1:28:55] the one who died on Calvary cross for us
[1:28:58] that's the love of God Amen that's what

[1:29:04] our heads Lord God we thank you Lord God

[1:29:09] abroad in our hearts Lord God lord cuz
[1:29:12] there not a greater love that we can
[1:29:14] experience Lord God than that the love
[1:29:17] of man cannot even compare to what you
[1:29:19] have for Lord for us Lord God the love
[1:29:22] of man Lord God is not even equivalent
[1:29:24] to what you have done for us Lord God
[1:29:27] for Calvary cross how you have poured
[1:29:30] your blood and shared your blood Lord so
[1:29:33] we can be redeemed so we can be saved
[1:29:35] Lord God so such creatures as us Lord
[1:29:38] God can have a chance to be able even
[1:29:40] Worship in your presence they even have
