this day because many has overlooked it but you amen amen has given it to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom god is the sea and it is to hear hearts to believe thank god for the elect of this hour called and chosen to be the bride of jesus christ thank god for you this morning the book of first peter 4 and 12 says beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials which are which is

suffering are you with me don't think it's strange you're partakers of christ's suffering amen appreciate what you're going through thank god for your trial and your test [Music] oh you will rejoice over it are you with me don't think it's strange amen but it says rejoice amen because you're partakers of his suffering of christ that when his what when his glory shall be revealed you may all you may be what glad also with what your joy is going to get greater it's going to be exceeding amen if ye be reproached for the name of christ and what are you happy this morning you know they sing a song we are happy people yes we are but are you happy praise god you ought to be happy amen happy amen we are happy people yes we are happy are ye for the spirit of what for the spirit of glory or and of god what if you're happy that's what's so uh the spirit of glory amen hallelujah of god rested upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is what hallelujah come on somebody somebody might even speak up what you're going through amen but it's your glory oh hallelujah but let none of you suffer as a myrtle or as a thief or as a what or as a what busy what in what that's got nothing to do with you so don't be busyboarding and something that blown to somebody else doesn't concern you because it'll take your joy away from you are you with me yet if any man suffer as a what if you're suffering as a christian let not let him not be what but let him glorify god on this behalf for the time is what the judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first began at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god for if the righteous scarcely be saved where should a center where should an ungodly and sinner appear are you with me wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their soul to him in well-doing as into a faithful creator god bless you reading his word you may be seated praise god i'm running for my life amen if anybody asks you what's the matter with me tell them i'm saved sanctified holy ghost filled fire baptized and i'm ready for my life amen i'm ready for my life i'm running for my life [Music] i got jesus on my side [Music] [Music] if anybody asks you what's the matter with me just tell them i'm saving sanctified holy ghost building up in baptized i got jesus on my side and [Music] if anybody [Music] i'm praying for my life i'm praying for my life i'm praying for my life i'm praying for my life everybody ask you what's the matter with me just tell them i'm saving sanctify holy ghost just tell them i'll say oh holy [Music] oh [Music] my life running for my life amen so in as we have choices that we make this morning we must understand that there's a judgment falling amid the decisions that you and i make and usually you and i make the wrong choices and as we look at the book of saint john 15 16 15 16. and i want to look at this verse here for a moment it says henceforth excuse me ye have not chosen me your choice versus god's choice you have not chosen me we're understanding that amen many choices that we make we make the wrong choices but the ultimate choice is not for you to make it's for god to make and god has before the foundation of the world chose you he made a decision whom he will choose because he was empath because him being all-knowing could make the right choice because he knew the end from the beginning and we can't tell god god you made a mistake when you chose me you're here because you are a product of god's chosen it wasn't your decision to be saved or to be amen the elect of god or the bride of jesus christ what god made amen in his full knowledge he for dane you before the foundation of the world amen and god did not make a mistake shall the things form say to him that form him why has thou made me thus has the power not power over the clay amen and we are in god's hand he's molding us and making us into his image and into his likeness and we must understand amen that you and i were god's choice amen but you try to make your own way and your own choosing which will only bring damnation to your soul but i will surrender to the will of god that we'll let go and let god have our lives that we'll start trying to control our destiny but let god amen who predestinated us amen unto the adoptions of sons and daughters of god let him have the preeminence in our lives amen you can have a much smoother ride through life but if you wanted to be rough and bumpy and you want a lot of clarity and trouble to come upon your life then go head on and try to ruin it for yourself you tried to do it your way amen because he said your ways are not my ways and your thoughts are not mine god is so high above so you got to realize amen your thoughts is no good so forget about how you think and what you think because amen you are amen you're just messing making a mess of things the trouble with man he tried to think that he's something when he's nothing he get caught up in his own little world of thinking that he's somebody special but who are you when we got a creator that created the sun and the moon and the universe and the world and all things that they're in your little peacock marine amen trying to compete with the amen the mind of god the great empathy god that has no beginning and no end god that got all power in his hand yet we thank ourselves something special that we can contend with god and try to challenge god's will and purpose for our lives we try to run our own life only to make a mess of things god bless you this morning trust that you'll stop for a minute and think about where you come from and where you're going amen god brought you from nowhere to somewhere come on they meant god brought him for nothing to something amen for when you did not exist god brought you into existence are you with me but you and i have been told that amen as a thought and as an attribute in the mind of god we were there but for the foundation of the world because i can identify with the attributes of god and knowing that i was a part of god's thinking even before the world began are you with me so he says here you have not chosen me but i've chosen you and ordain you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will he may what he may give it you amen but you got to identify amen that i recognize that god you chose me somebody said lord will you lead me i'll follow the bible said they that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god you know i was just looking back in my life and trying to find out what how did i get where i am and i started listening from my beginning where god really started dealing with me that i heard that small steel voice that god spoke to me and i knew it was god then when i began to go through certain tests and certain trials in my life i heard that voice speak again to take me to my death next destination i did not argue with the voice of god somebody said i was not disobedient to the heavenly see sometimes we're disobedient when god speak and you know it's god but i was not disobedient when i heard that voice i knew that was god that called me out of the world and saved me it came down to god revealing the word for this day i knew that was god so i had to go back in the midst of the world and the chaos that's going on with the things that god is sending this day in this hour you had to go back and see where you started god it was you that spoke to me and said this is my servant you know sometimes we have to be reassured amen because things could get kind of chaotic sometimes even concerning your salvation things could get kind of chaotic sometimes things can get kind of shook up sometime and we can count on the lord amen amen where are you lord i need your lord you need him to speak to you lucky spoke to you in time past god knows how to lead you he know how to guard you sometimes we have to settle down and be still and know that i'm god so god you that spoke to me time past speak to me now i need to hear your voice i need your leadership i need you to guide me through these treacherous waters time like these amen we need the lord somebody said if we haven't needed the lord before we sure do need him now brother sister i'm not depending on or somebody else revelation i'm not dependent on the church revelation amen you don't depend on brother simmons revelation you got to get your own revelation amen god got to speak to you as an individual mama can't help your daddy can help you god is our only help you're going to be tested and tried ezekiel 24 24. it's time that we all wake up amen and see the signs of the time judgment is hitting the earth and it's hitting at heart not only in lake charles but all over the world judgment is hitting california with all the fires they meant it just about in flattened lake charles louisiana and hurricanes and earthquakes and fires and oh god just things happening everywhere amen it's almost out of control amen by the time man tried they meant to fix the situation of amid the pandemic hitting everywhere there's so much going on we're out of control we can't keep up they meant with all the chaos and all the stuff that's hitting the earth it's judgment time man why don't we wake up and repent lord have mercy the world cannot repent but you are the elect came in as the chosen of god we must come to a place that we repent repent and recognize that god is saying signs of the judgment has come a minute and the wrath of god is being pulled out [Music] talked about the scum they meant of the earth talked about god saying amen he's not going to turn back his wrath his judgment praise god because of the filthiness of israel god says he's going to pull out his firing indignation god is not going to stop payment the punishment and the judgment that he's placing upon this world because of the lewdness and the filthiness of mankind god said i'm going to charge israel told ezekiel i want you to lay on your side so many uh days this way and then i want you to turn around and i want to lay on your side so many days and ezekiel amen laying on his side amen amen for 300 and some odd days and then they turn around and live on the other side i'm going to tell you amen god got away praise god ezekiel was just a sign of judgment a sign of what god was going to do in reality time he gave them a sign but did they believe the sign i believe the sign was being overlooked praise god don't you and i overlook god's sign for our time 24 and 24. thus ezekiel is under you a sign praise god hosea and all that he went through he was a prophet of god that was told by god i want you to marry an infant woman i want you to marry a woman oh god that is a harlot and i want you to marry her and she will not be faithful to you but i want you to marry her because hosea was a sign amen how amen jose a wife was amen treating him that's how god's people amen was treating him well sometimes the burden get pretty heavy they meant but uh hosel amen he did what god said ezekiel amen sometimes amen his mother was pretty difficult to lay on one side amen for so many days but he was faithful to god and i believe if we're in the will of god god will sustain us give us the strength to do what he's saying amen yes you've been tested yet you've been tried but i believe that one day amen god will have you ain't meant to be a sign to this generation amen god will have you to be a billboard amen that this generation will be judgeless they meant by the life that you live that god said i got somebody that would lift up a standard i got somebody that'll be holy i got somebody that will live for god thank god somebody that be faithful hallelujah or somebody that will hold on to god's unchanging hand i'm so glad that somebody's willing zicola a sign according to all that i've done shall you do according to all that he done shall ye do and when this comet ye shall know that i am the lord god amen i believe amen amen ezekiel amen did what god said and when it was done they'll know that i'm god the lord god i believe amen certain things are on the horizon praise god we're in election time and certain things are on the horizon they met with certain things that were seen by vision and prophesied they amen we'll see these things began to come to pass they met the little car going down the street without a steering wheel maybe a woman rise up in america maybe to be vice president or president amen maybe the catholic church coming into power as it already has all these things they meant are signs to this generation i believe that god amen gave us a mean sign to wake us up before judgment come god will send a warning but i want you to know true fine were always overlooked amen in the days of noah amen the people saw they meant the sign that god gave them amen was a prophet by the name of noah but as it was in the days of noah and as it was in the days of sodom did the people take heed to the warning of god amen certainly this generation will not but we're you suddenly the rest of the world amen have not taken heed they're not hearing the voice of god but i believe that there were the people that were for known of god they meant they would hear the voice of god they were here when god called they would know that it's not an uncertain sound what is a certain sound god said i call you i told you amen i want you to be saved lame and i find grace in my sight don't you see my grace my grace is pulled out upon you because it is the sound of the headstone that is shouting grace to you and i oh yes brother sister oh yes judgment is getting ready to strike judgment is striking oh brother sister but there'll be a people that are called out women are calling out of a bride for rapture for body change amen we're getting ready to take flight what brother are you ready just are you ready amen hey we're getting ready to take out the countdown on his own amen do you hear him calling oh yes oh brother sister we got to be somebody that's geared up somebody that's prayed up somebody that has faith amen he said shall he find faith they met somebody that's amen said ah amen i'm faithful they meant to not call hallelujah oh i believe that

double potion that anointing that will lift you up hallelujah bring you into your expectation amen that you might be a manifestation amen of what it means amen to have wretched in faith that the power of god the right to oblige will catch a hold of somebody hallelujah not just something to make you feel good but something inside to energize you something to take you higher something to draw you closer something that you know that's real hallelujah i'm not serving a fiction god amen this is a real god amen the holy ghost is real the power of god is real the word of god in the tower is real god is giving us a sign amen signs of the time reality is struck brother and sister we got to realize amen that reality must track your soul you must know that god has given you an eye this opportunity to repent amen praise god and do your first works they meant repent hallelujah for amen you left your first love they meant to come back in tune with the word amen forget about this whole world praise god it's falling apart amen they can't sustain amen all the judgments are striking forget about it brother get your mind on going somewhere amen this world is going to burn with fire the element's going gonna melt with the fervent heat get your mind on leaving here hey my mind ain't mean to go leaving here i got to get out of here i got to go to my father's house i got to leave here there's a world behind brother sister amen let's get ready to take flight how many eagles what you've been waiting on then i said we waited long enough them to wait on the lord amen praise god we'll wait but we're not faint they should mine up praise god check your wings out amen man up with wings as an eagle god with your eagle wings start mounting up amen checking it amen out i fly amen praise god can i fly can i take flight oh hallelujah check your engine out check your faith out check out whether or not everything is working properly let us examine ourselves see what we stand amen is the time for god to come back for his bride is the pride ready for take off your life ready they meant for amen praise god to be changed and the moment in the twinkling of an eye are you ready to be changed for mortal to immortality are you ready or are you preparing yourself for the judgment so you all must appear at the judgment seat of christ amen because judgment began in the house of god and if it first began at us then where should a sinner and the ungodly amen where they're going to appear and after righteousness scarcely you you just go scarcely make it in scarcely amen this thing going to be amen quick and you're gonna just just barely make it amen this ain't gonna be a thing that you just ain't gonna wait till the last minute and you're gonna pack your bags and run and get some all you got to have your all already there's no time for getting right you got to get right church now and let's go home amen pack up now don't don't don't wait to that time and then start packing you got to start packing now oh brother sister so many go miss that oh lord you don't miss your opportunity brother and sister we beseech you by the mercies of god amen that you present your bodies a living sacrifice amen as i go back to peter for a moment i got to close but by the grace of god he says beloved thinking not strange i'm telling you what i've been seeing with folks they're doing just the opposite but you know why they're doing the opposite as a whole perhaps they're not to be loved if you're the beloved of god then he's admonishing you and he's saying to you think it not strains are you with me but the way we speak the way we conduct ourselves and the way we are talking it's just saying that it's a true sign overlooked the things that god has done in this hour and this day i believe we missed the whole thing i believe we'll miss the sign that god has given us to this generation because our way we conduct our lives and the way we handle our uh our suffering our trials and the way we deal with our situations and our problems and our attitude towards the world and our attitude towards one another causes us to recognize that something is wrong we think it's strange that it's not supposed to happen this way amen it's supposed to happen the way it's happening to you and the reason why you're not passing the test because you're thinking it's strange and he said think it not strange isn't that right praise god why did this have to be for me why i have to go through this and why i had to go through that why didn't what did i do wrong oh thinking not strange come on somebody see if we do what the words say and then we'll get the results that the words say we should have amen you have been chosen of god god chose you for your trial and he chose the tribe for you to perfect you are you with me so when you're going through your tests and your trial don't think it's strange because this is your perfection amen but you got to have the right mental attitude towards the word to get the blessings for me to draw amen your dividend amen god wants to add amen to your faith virtue and god wants to add to your virtue amen god want to take you up to knowledge temporary and so forth patience and amen he want to take you up to the statue of a perfect man but god cannot take you into his divine nature except you recognize that his divine nature is working through your faith through your virtue to your patient amen god has taken you up into a place of a secret place taking you to the innervale taking you into the holy of holies amen god is taking you to a higher level but you must learn to adjust amen every trial and every test don't think it's strange but you got to conduct yourself as though amen that don't even exist it doesn't not hinder me amen i don't even consider it amen amen the bible said abraham considered not his body being dead i don't even consider amen my body being dead i believe that with the stripes i'm healed i'm not even gonna consider what the doctor said cancer has no hallelujah i don't even consider it amen hallelujah not a deadness of sarah's womb i don't even consider that i don't consider what they call a problem amen i'm not considering dementia i'm not considering high blood pressure sugar diabetes i don't consider that it's just a trial it's just a test but i know that with the strikes i'm here so if i start praising god but not for what i see what what i believe amen what the word said about it and what god told me but it had to be revealed to you by revelation for you to get your substance from it for you to get your victory out of it for faith is the substance i want my substance my faith is here to get my substance amen praise god i can get what the bible said what the word said he said you can act in my name because you're chosen of god are you with me you've not chosen me i've chosen you and i gave you a place that i said you can act in my name and i'll give it to you are you with me so we on that journey amen concerning this thinking not strange that as though some strange thing happened to you but what rejoice rejoice hallelujah whatever the devil has done to you rejoice they meant people are on a trip and they're trying to get deep revelation and they're trying to get mystified and reaching out for all different types of ways to show what god do what the prophet is saying and people are rejoicing off a revelation and they're not rejoicing off of their suffering he said when you get revelation rejoice amen he said rejoice when you go through are you with me people rejoicing off the wrong thing just because you receive a mystery amen and i understand all mistress he didn't say rejoice because you understand all mysteries amen praise god but he wants you to rejoice amen when you're going through something you know how to conduct yourself and character is being mold this is character building this is where god is bringing you into the judgment seat of
