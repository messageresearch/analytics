[31:04] i pray for your people
[31:07] lord and bless the word tonight
[31:10] in jesus name amen may be seated
[31:19] i want to use for
[31:22] a thought tonight as i was listening
[31:26] to one of the messages of the hour
[31:30] on a god
[31:35] and as i began to listening listen to it
[31:42] and within myself i said you know that
[31:44] was really
[31:46] where we really at now in this hour
[31:51] a god
[31:56] many of us
[32:00] if we will go to
[32:03] a foreign country or someplace or
[32:06] another that we
[32:07] not really are familiar with
[32:11] you'll be seeking someone to be able to
[32:15] show you around
[32:18] someone that is familiar
[32:22] with the city or the country or wherever
[32:27] you are going at and one of the reasons
[32:31] that you
[32:31] do that because you just don't want to
[32:33] be wandering around
[32:35] and get lost
[32:39] servant god said that's a good thing
[32:41] that you shouldn't go anywhere where you
[32:44] are not don't have some kind of god that
[32:48] can scruck you where to go
[32:52] and as i was thinking i said lord truly
[32:56] uh this is the hour that we don't need
[32:58] to be wondering
[33:02] with so much chaos and so much epidemic
[33:05] and so much voices that
[33:09] we have saying this and saying that to
[33:12] where
[33:13] uh it puts the people in a confused
[33:16] state
[33:18] because everybody seemed to have an
[33:20] opinion
[33:23] everybody seemed to had even sometimes
[33:26] scientific
[33:27] information and then they come back
[33:31] and say well it's not correct
[33:35] but yet once you put something out there
[33:41] somebody's going to hold to it
[33:45] and some will follow it
[33:48] and then they begin to find out it was
[33:50] wrong
[33:54] but you know i thank god spiritually
[33:57] speaking this
[33:58] hour that we are not left without a god
[34:04] many of us we as i did
[34:09] try to lead myself try to do
[34:13] what i thought and that's where we get
[34:17] in trouble right there
[34:21] we have thought we have plans we have
[34:24] goals we have
[34:25] ambition nothing wrong with that but did
[34:28] you seek the lord
[34:33] after all he is the one that gave you
[34:36] life but man has
[34:40] always tried to lead themselves
[34:45] and if you look at our country we see
[34:48] the chaotic mess we got
[34:52] cause sometimes group of people can form
[34:56] groups of intelligence and put their
[34:59] masterminds together to
[35:02] do a thing but yet without seeking god
[35:06] about it
[35:08] and the bible say in one place that you
[35:10] know uh proverbs i believe it says that
[35:13] there's a way that seemeth right
[35:19] to a man but that way
[35:22] the way of death
[35:27] i look at it in the natural and we know
[35:29] the natural type
[35:30] so spiritual and the servant of god was
[35:34] saying there you know in that message
[35:36] there that
[35:38] uh a god has to be a selected person
[35:45] anybody just can't be a guy like we got
[35:48] now today
[35:51] we have people that have no training no
[35:54] no
[35:54] kind of background no kind of uh
[35:57] experience and
[35:59] and they lead the whole country
[36:03] by what intelligence
[36:08] and every time even we do it and
[36:11] we find out we'll round up we wind up in
[36:14] a mess
[36:19] and then we feel well we'll get somebody
[36:22] else
[36:25] and lord behold that fail
[36:29] so we have constantly having failure
[36:32] upon the failures
[36:34] upon the failure because the wrong kind
[36:36] of god
[36:42] and god has a remedy
[36:46] god has had provided a way that
[36:50] we can live like we ought to like he
[36:53] wants us to uh to be prosperous that
[36:57] have good health health but we always
[37:00] reject
[37:01] that way
[37:06] you reject the way that god has provided
[37:10] but yet you take what anybody else makes
[37:15] to tell us
[37:20] because god's way is not like our ways
[37:25] god uh sees it in a different avenue and
[37:29] he just don't look at um now present but
[37:33] god look at the future
[37:38] who would you rather listen to somebody
[37:41] that
[37:41] knows what's going to happen at the end
[37:44] or you will just take the good old way
[37:46] now and perish later
[37:51] see we we are failed to
[37:55] listen to the correct god but we got
[37:58] these blind gods
[38:04] intellectually and uh
[38:07] minds that can put things together
[38:11] in all the mechanical way but
[38:15] it still fails but hearing um
[38:19] psalm 38 or 2 and 80 it says
[38:23] uh i like the way it has even read you
[38:25] know because
[38:26] it put not emphasis on uh
[38:30] several men but it said i
[38:35] god's saying i will
[38:38] instruct you
[38:42] i don't know nobody else that i can put
[38:44] my confidence in
[38:46] i don't know nobody else that just don't
[38:49] know what's going on now
[38:51] but he knows the future he knows what's
[38:55] best for us even when we don't even
[38:57] think so
[38:58] god was always right
[39:02] tell me what man you can say that about
[39:06] every man in his best of failure
[39:10] even the best intentions we have of
[39:13] doing the right things and we still fail
[39:18] but if we can just understand that
[39:21] god is is it's got a way made for
[39:26] us
[39:30] i mean because god's way is not like us
[39:34] or like we want it and to please us
[39:38] i say to please the flesh we reject
[39:42] that way because it's a straight way
[39:45] but it's a way that a leads you to glory
[39:51] the bible said many are called and feel
[39:54] chosen another place it says
[39:56] great is the gate
[39:59] you know i i i can't excuse my kids
[40:02] can't
[40:02] for never forget when i heard that and i
[40:04] was in that
[40:06] place and that preacher come church of
[40:08] god and says scrape is the gate
[40:11] and there was something about it i
[40:13] wanted it
[40:15] didn't even know really what i was
[40:17] saying but something in me
[40:20] had to come to a conclusion i tried to
[40:22] live my life
[40:24] a certain kind of way and it became a
[40:27] pure mess a shipwreck
[40:31] and no doubt you don't mean for it to be
[40:33] like that
[40:35] but because it's humanistically nature
[40:39] and this mindset and you know how you
[40:42] were young
[40:43] you think oh i'm i'm gonna enjoy life
[40:47] i'm gonna i'll do this and i'm gonna do
[40:49] that
[40:51] because i want to do it
[40:56] and you'll find out and i hope you'll
[40:58] find out real soon and try not to really
[41:01] try those things but
[41:02] take heed
[41:06] godway is the best
[41:10] no doubt many of you when you're growing
[41:12] up and still yet
[41:13] uh you try to choose a school that you
[41:17] uh feel that can lead guide you in the
[41:20] right direction
[41:22] and that's good to try to get some of
[41:25] the best schools
[41:27] some that got prominent professors and
[41:30] you know and
[41:31] prominent of people that has got a good
[41:34] track record you search it out and you
[41:36] know the
[41:37] instant out of it but did you see god
[41:44] see because what could be good for one
[41:47] person
[41:49] may not be for you
[41:52] see god got something for you
[41:55] god got a way for you to go
[42:00] but when you do it your way you know how
[42:03] we get
[42:04] i'm grown now
[42:08] really are you growner than your creator
[42:15] he knows where you headed that
[42:19] servant of god said there's nothing in
[42:22] your life that you can do that god
[42:24] already don't know
[42:28] every place you go every turn that you
[42:31] make
[42:32] god already know you're gonna do it but
[42:34] he let
[42:35] you choose it
[42:38] watch what you choose
[42:41] see you ought to sit down and and really
[42:44] consider the pros
[42:46] and the cons where is this going to lead
[42:50] me
[42:52] you looking at the natural effects of
[42:55] success
[42:56] and and the riches and the glory
[42:59] or where you can live and what you can
[43:01] have but have you really considered the
[43:03] end of the matter
[43:09] you know i don't know about you but many
[43:11] times i know now we look at our life
[43:13] we said boy if i would only just
[43:17] listen if i
[43:20] would have only just made the right
[43:23] choices
[43:25] you could have been spared for some
[43:27] other thing that you might be going
[43:29] through right now
[43:31] like i told maybe i said but you can't
[43:33] take it back
[43:35] but you can use it as a stepping stone
[43:41] god wants you to be successful
[43:44] god wants you to prosper too
[43:48] because he is in the but it's a way to
[43:50] do it
[43:54] don't just take the educational way
[43:57] of it but see god about it
[44:00] nothing wrong with getting any device
[44:03] but carefully sit down and
[44:06] write the pros and the khan right ahead
[44:08] of that
[44:09] put god first
[44:12] i'll be the bible say seek ye
[44:15] first the kingdom of god and
[44:19] all his righteousness and everything
[44:23] else will be added to you isn't that
[44:26] simple
[44:28] but it's the hardest thing to get us to
[44:30] do
[44:31] too hard isn't it yes well what is
[44:35] hard about it it's our desire
[44:41] but god said there in uh uh
[44:45] 32 he said now i
[44:48] will inscrut thee and teach
[44:51] thee in the way
[44:54] which thou shall go i will
[44:57] god thee with my eye
[45:02] oh my i look at these things now i said
[45:06] lord
[45:06] i you know wish that i would have really
[45:10] took more heed to the things that i've
[45:12] heard and not let them slip
[45:15] but you know i can do something about it
[45:17] now
[45:19] what has in the past is in the past
[45:22] i'm gonna forget those things behind me
[45:26] and i'm gonna press see
[45:29] you we have another opportunity
[45:33] of what we did back there is gone
[45:40] but now you're in a brand new 2020 lord
[45:44] have mercy
[45:46] 2021
[45:49] if i if you were gonna make a new year
[45:52] resolution
[45:53] call up the costs
[45:58] cut it up think soberly of
[46:01] what am i gonna do with this life god
[46:03] gave me
[46:07] remember that god gave it to you but he
[46:09] gonna let
[46:10] you choose
[46:14] do he already know what you're going to
[46:18] do
[46:19] you know why because you want somebody
[46:21] they made me do it
[46:25] god put adam leaded him on freeway he
[46:28] put the tree of knowledge and good and
[46:29] evil
[46:30] he put life and death right in the same
[46:33] garden
[46:35] he also gave them now don't touch
[46:39] this tree all
[46:42] you will die eat of everything
[46:46] else why was that so hard
[46:50] the curious that curiosity kills the cat
[46:55] it killed the whole human race
[46:59] one woman disbelieved one word
[47:04] and this is why we in the condition let
[47:06] me in right now today
[47:08] reasoning
[47:13] can't just take god for it now it it
[47:16] looked like especially now that if
[47:18] anybody can prove whatever girl tell a
[47:20] lie
[47:21] you have a reason to be able to doubt it
[47:26] but there is no proof nowhere
[47:31] because he knows all things
[47:37] yes you're young you're ambitious
[47:40] that's all right but god's saying
[47:44] seek me first
[47:47] i give you the desires of your heart
[47:51] if you're followed to know me saith the
[47:54] lord
[47:57] have mercy hard age to get the people
[48:02] that believe that god is the best god
[48:04] there is
[48:07] servant of god was sending that message
[48:09] of the god he
[48:11] was saying that god has to be in some
[48:13] states
[48:15] or the state have to select them
[48:19] and they have to be able to sign off if
[48:21] they're going to take somebody out
[48:23] that they're reliable he has to see some
[48:25] kind of proof of they've been trained
[48:27] properly you know to be able to take you
[48:31] out there and to lead you in the right
[48:34] way
[48:35] he has to know that he is responsible
[48:39] for what happens to you
[48:42] he has to know that if the weather get
[48:45] bad
[48:45] off a tornado or something come he has
[48:48] to know where you act he has to
[48:50] be able to track you and approach you in
[48:52] the right direction
[48:54] for safety if something was to go wrong
[48:58] he has to know this he can't get you out
[49:02] there somewhere and say well
[49:04] now what did i tell them
[49:09] and you out there wondering panicking
[49:11] about to die
[49:13] you see that's why god he gave us the
[49:16] best god
[49:19] he didn't leave it in the hand over some
[49:21] man that went to some
[49:23] kind of school or or this or that no
[49:26] he said let's go let's go read that guy
[49:29] a little bit
[49:30] saint john 16.
[49:33] and i'm closing
[49:38] this pandemic and all that we see going
[49:41] on
[49:42] the news and lord have mercy and
[49:44] everything from
[49:46] every way and every angle
[49:49] uh is chaotic
[49:54] because we're relying on the wrong god
[49:59] do what you call blind guides
[50:04] we are trying to make something come
[50:07] back
[50:08] that has been destroyed
[50:12] could the bible say if the foundation
[50:14] has been destroyed
[50:16] where should a godly appear
[50:19] what are we going to do if the fight if
[50:21] you then destroy
[50:22] the what's the founding of something
[50:24] that holds everything
[50:26] up if the foundation had been destroyed
[50:29] what are you building on brother
[50:32] you building upon sinking sand
[50:37] man has come to they're destroying
[50:40] themselves with
[50:44] interventions
[50:48] they want to make it better again
[50:54] and all the signs and everything
[50:57] everywhere all the signs are pointing
[51:00] that
[51:01] it's never coming back
[51:04] no matter what they do
[51:08] they're going to try and all they got
[51:11] spent all that they got to try to make
[51:15] us think that it's going to get better
[51:18] that's why i hear people oh yeah it's 20
[51:20] 21 now
[51:22] and we're gonna have it's a new year and
[51:24] things are going to this
[51:27] depending on what you're looking at
[51:31] are you looking at the count and how
[51:33] people are leaving here daily i've been
[51:36] saying lord sanders but every six
[51:38] minutes or so
[51:39] people are dying
[51:44] lord help us
[51:48] saint john 16
[52:01] seventh verse
[52:04] through 13.
[52:07] nevertheless i'll tell you the truth
[52:11] it is expedient for you that i go away
[52:15] for if i go not away the comforter
[52:19] will not come unto you but if i depart
[52:24] i will send him unto you
[52:27] see it's a person and when he
[52:30] not them and when he is
[52:33] come he will prove the word of sin
[52:38] and of righteousness and of judgment
[52:42] of sin because they believe not on me
[52:46] of righteousness because i go to my
[52:49] father
[52:51] and you see me no more of judgment
[52:54] because the prince
[52:56] of this world is judged
[53:00] you see i have yet many things to say
[53:03] unto you but you cannot bear them
[53:06] howbeit when he
[53:09] the spirit of truth is come he will do
[53:13] what
[53:15] into all truth
[53:22] for he shall not speak of himself
[53:25] but whatsoever he shall you should hear
[53:28] that shall he speak he will show you
[53:32] things to come your god
[53:38] someone that
[53:42] it's going to lead you into all truth
[53:48] we took it from the natural and we know
[53:50] the natural types of spiritual
[53:55] we need a spiritual god
[53:59] and the servant of god was saying
[54:01] someone that who know where they're
[54:03] going
[54:05] you he knows how to take you there but
[54:10] will you follow
[54:13] they oftentimes say you can lead a horse
[54:16] to the trout
[54:17] but you can't make them drink
[54:20] we can show you by the word where you
[54:24] ought to and where you need to go but
[54:27] no man can make you do it
[54:30] you are the free motion
[54:33] you can choose to say whether i don't
[54:36] want that
[54:38] uh well i'll do that later or maybe you
[54:42] got a better way
[54:45] maybe you are much more smarter than god
[54:48] is maybe you know
[54:51] something that god don't know like eve
[54:54] did
[54:54] uh you know she found out something adam
[54:57] didn't knew
[55:01] found out what she knew that it caused
[55:04] chaos
[55:06] adam knew you what have you done
[55:11] come adam show let me show you
[55:15] in other words what god kept back from
[55:18] us
[55:19] no god told me you don't eat that tree
[55:21] or you're gonna die
[55:24] you know that curiosity is still people
[55:27] have that spirit
[55:29] still living today people always accuse
[55:31] well
[55:32] you know um well i know you know
[55:36] and they'll try to reason maybe you know
[55:39] but everybody else just seemed to be
[55:41] enjoying it and and and seem to be doing
[55:44] well
[55:44] maybe you know ain't nothing happened to
[55:47] them don't
[55:48] realize spiritually they're dead
[55:54] that's why it says that it was better
[55:56] for you not to know the way
[55:58] and to know it and depart from it
[56:02] because we know what we ought to do
[56:06] but seemingly you know i know the
[56:09] hardness of the
[56:10] organization system that you know that
[56:14] people if they had the bishop to make
[56:17] them do it they'll do it
[56:20] because the bishop put some force on
[56:23] them
[56:26] and he tell them heavy
[56:30] but god is a man that's meek and lowly
[56:35] and he said come unto me and i give you
[56:38] rest for your soul
[56:40] you got to come but a jesus said no one
[56:43] can come
[56:44] except the father draw them but
[56:47] how many times have we heard the voice
[56:52] you heard the god voice calling
[56:57] and you understand real well that i
[56:59] found out
[57:00] until i say people can do whatever they
[57:03] want to do if they really want to do it
[57:06] but because of our self-will that we
[57:12] have and a spirit of disobedience
[57:15] we seem to don't want it that way
[57:21] we want it another way but jesus said i
[57:26] am the way the truth
[57:31] into life you know it's strange to see
[57:35] that
[57:36] how that people uh can believe
[57:39] any other man that tells them anything
[57:42] you know for his job
[57:43] wise or even the doctors or or whatever
[57:46] and they can believe what he they say
[57:49] but they can't take what god say
[57:52] and the bible says it means hates his
[57:54] liars
[57:56] but show me where god have a boston it
[57:58] is impossible
[58:01] for god to lie
[58:05] see uh this god here
[58:08] uh he went away and he
[58:11] sent something back
[58:14] that we were gonna need
[58:18] and surely in this hour we need a god
[58:23] i mean a real god that knows what he's
[58:27] doing
[58:29] that knows that if you lost i can guide
[58:32] you back to the path of life
[58:35] but you got to come follow me
[58:38] jesus told him every time he met with
[58:40] him he said
[58:42] come pick up your cross and come follow
[58:44] me see
[58:46] why because he was the god
[58:49] he did they had pharisees in the senate
[58:51] but he said no blind guy he said
[58:54] they did they trying to keep the law but
[58:57] he said
[58:57] i come to fulfill what the law has
[59:00] already spoken of me
[59:04] and they thought jesus was coming with a
[59:06] whole different kind of religion but no
[59:08] it was the very word that they were
[59:11] studying that was spoken of him
[59:14] and he was right there fulfilling it
[59:18] and yet they call him the devil
[59:21] wow what kind of proof they had
[59:25] none but because of their religious
[59:29] standard they had it they knew the
[59:32] scroll
[59:33] abraham of a father moses said
[59:36] jesus said before moses the world
[59:38] abraham was out of hell
[59:41] what is this man talking about he's only
[59:42] 30 something years how can he be before
[59:44] abraham
[59:46] church tonight
[59:50] follow your god
[59:53] which is the holy ghost
[59:56] no matter how much we preach how much we
[59:59] teach
[1:00:00] you have to have the holy ghost he
[1:00:04] will lead you but if you follow the
[1:00:07] instructions
[1:00:09] that he left you sure to get it
[1:00:13] but you must follow the god
[1:00:17] god bless you tonight
[1:00:29] [Music]
[1:00:37] god bless amen we thank god for
[1:00:41] the word and the songs and thank god for
[1:00:44] each and every one of you to press your
[1:00:45] way out tonight
[1:00:47] jesus christ the same yesterday today in
[1:00:49] favor
[1:00:51] so where you lead me i'll follow amen
[1:00:54] and brother and sister if it's ever been
[1:00:57] a time we need
[1:00:58] to follow him amen because he'll lead us
[1:01:02] all the way from earth to glory
[1:01:06] trying to turn this thing off but that
[1:01:10] somebody get it praise god god is good
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:16] so by the grace of god we knowing that
[1:01:21] life here on this earth
[1:01:24] it's very very short it's like grass
[1:01:29] i like the flowers it'll fade away
[1:01:32] in just a short time
[1:01:35] when you get my age you'll see how
[1:01:40] short life is and you got to take this
[1:01:44] time
[1:01:44] to make the best of every moment
[1:01:48] but one thing you don't want to do
[1:01:51] is waste time because time is precious
[1:01:57] the time that god has given us to live
[1:02:00] on this earth
[1:02:01] is very short for he said the days of a
[1:02:05] man life is three school years and ten
[1:02:07] and by reading the strength there'll be
[1:02:09] four school years
[1:02:11] that time is very valuable what we do
[1:02:14] with the little time that we have here
[1:02:16] some felt to sleep it away some folks
[1:02:19] are drank it away some folks are duck
[1:02:22] dope it away some folks just have
[1:02:23] pledges
[1:02:25] but god didn't give us this life that we
[1:02:27] have
[1:02:28] just to throw it away and to waste it
[1:02:33] gave us life and life is precious
[1:02:39] but this life here
[1:02:43] it'll perish
[1:02:47] but god wants to give us his life
[1:02:50] and that's zoey god's own life that's
[1:02:53] eternal
[1:02:56] and the bible tells us that one day it's
[1:02:58] what the lord is a thousand years and
[1:02:59] thousand years is one day
[1:03:02] brother and sister if you think about it
[1:03:06] how you waste time how you waste your
[1:03:09] life
[1:03:10] you know just praying today just
[1:03:15] coming out here just praying and crying
[1:03:17] at the lord and
[1:03:18] while i'm spraying i just said lord
[1:03:20] we're wasting time
[1:03:23] we're wasting this opportunity that we
[1:03:26] have to live
[1:03:27] and what are we doing for god
[1:03:31] how how how successful can we be
[1:03:36] in life yet we miss the opportunity
[1:03:40] to serve god's purpose in god's plan and
[1:03:43] god's will for our lives
[1:03:47] and all of our trying and all of our
[1:03:49] doing
[1:03:52] if it's not god's plan and god's purpose
[1:03:55] and god's will then the prophet of god
[1:03:58] says
[1:03:59] we can try to do god of service without
[1:04:02] his being his will
[1:04:05] we got to find out god what will i have
[1:04:08] me to do
[1:04:10] and can i serve your purpose i only have
[1:04:13] a little time
[1:04:14] that i'm going to be here lord can i
[1:04:16] amen
[1:04:18] do it the right way and can i be in your
[1:04:22] perfect plan
[1:04:23] and your will lord not my will but let
[1:04:26] thine be done
[1:04:28] jesus had a struggle himself and he was
[1:04:31] god
[1:04:32] he had a struggle and a battle because
[1:04:36] he meant amen every devil out of the
[1:04:38] pits of hell was coming against him
[1:04:42] and because of the struggle that he had
[1:04:45] and he was
[1:04:46] facing death of the cross and he said
[1:04:48] father
[1:04:49] if it's possible to let this cup pass
[1:04:53] but he said nevertheless i got a purpose
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:56] for this hour amen this is why i was
[1:04:59] born
[1:05:01] and said i said saving from this hour
[1:05:05] brother and sister when jesus amen
[1:05:08] knowing that it's suffering in pain that
[1:05:10] he was then do
[1:05:13] he said if it's possible let this
[1:05:15] compass
[1:05:17] brother and sister but if it's god's
[1:05:20] will
[1:05:20] in god's purpose and is for the good
[1:05:25] then you we must be willing to suffer
[1:05:28] to add in in the pain
[1:05:32] that god's purpose and plan might be
[1:05:36] in our lives sometimes we don't want to
[1:05:40] give up
[1:05:40] our will and our plan and i i what we
[1:05:44] want and what we want to do
[1:05:47] we don't want to give it up for god's
[1:05:49] purpose
[1:05:51] for we hold to our own will
[1:05:55] instead of him guiding us we got
[1:05:57] ourselves
[1:05:59] instead of him leading us we lead
[1:06:01] ourselves
[1:06:03] and we say here it is god it must be
[1:06:06] good
[1:06:08] it must be god because god is blessing
[1:06:10] it
[1:06:12] it must be god because it's working out
[1:06:18] brother and sister i'm going to tell you
[1:06:19] something this
[1:06:21] path when god
[1:06:25] takes you down a path this flesh don't
[1:06:27] want to go down that plan
[1:06:30] when god has something for you to do
[1:06:32] i'll tell you it's a struggle
[1:06:34] and it's a battle to do it because all
[1:06:37] the devils in hell will try to keep you
[1:06:39] away from god's plan and purpose for
[1:06:41] your life
[1:06:42] but once you amen pass through you're
[1:06:46] struck on your
[1:06:47] oh hallelujah when you get there
[1:06:52] and then you find out hey god i i i i i
[1:06:55] i i i'm on course now
[1:06:59] amen but you got to get to amen
[1:07:02] your struggle and your battle amen how
[1:07:06] you know sometimes prophet god said when
[1:07:10] a man want to do
[1:07:11] something he said 9 out of 10
[1:07:14] god didn't call him to do it
[1:07:18] he said it's only those that don't want
[1:07:20] to do it
[1:07:23] he said now look at god's servant moses
[1:07:25] said
[1:07:26] when he wanted to do it even he was all
[1:07:29] wrong
[1:07:30] he thought he could do it with his own
[1:07:32] ability
[1:07:33] but when he came to the point
[1:07:37] on the back side of the desert and he
[1:07:39] didn't have any more confidence in
[1:07:40] himself
[1:07:41] when he became perfectly weak then he
[1:07:43] was strong
[1:07:45] god said now you and your 80s come on i
[1:07:48] want you to do it now
[1:07:51] why because it wasn't moses that was
[1:07:54] going to deliver to god's people it was
[1:07:56] god gonna do it and moses wasn't gonna
[1:08:00] get the credit for it
[1:08:02] are you with me and god wants you to get
[1:08:06] the glory out of our lives
[1:08:08] as long as you seek it when moses was
[1:08:10] strong
[1:08:11] and moses could do it and had all his
[1:08:13] intellect oh yeah i can do it
[1:08:16] but moses had to come to the place where
[1:08:18] he couldn't do it
[1:08:21] and we got to come to the place where i
[1:08:23] can't
[1:08:25] but nevertheless lord amen once i become
[1:08:29] to the point
[1:08:30] that i can't do it oh yes it's a
[1:08:32] struggle brother and sister
[1:08:34] every day you know i'm constantly in
[1:08:38] prayer lord i you know i can't do it
[1:08:42] yeah amen i can't lead those people i
[1:08:45] can't
[1:08:45] sharpen this flock but
[1:08:48] god i know i can't do it but you can
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:54] i'm a failure god and i fail all the
[1:08:58] time
[1:08:59] but lord you do it
[1:09:03] are you with me see brother and sister
[1:09:06] once we depend on him to do the job
[1:09:09] it's not about our ability or our
[1:09:12] ingenuity
[1:09:15] but it's god's spirit that does the
[1:09:17] world
[1:09:19] and we let god do it it'll be done
[1:09:22] well and we won't get any glory
[1:09:26] because that's not what we want god
[1:09:29] you be glorified amen

[1:09:36] man is going to come to nothing but when
[1:09:39] we lift up jesus
