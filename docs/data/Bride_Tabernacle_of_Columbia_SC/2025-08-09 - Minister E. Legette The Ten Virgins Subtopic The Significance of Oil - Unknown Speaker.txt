We just thank you, Lord, for bringing us through another week. And, oh God, keeping us by your divine power, Lord. We thank you for that tonight, Lord. We pray, oh God, that you would speak to our hearts just now, Lord. And that your Holy Spirit, God, would come in this place. God, I know it will because you said where two or three are gathered in my name that there I'd be in the midst. And God, we just thank you for that tonight. Lord, we pray, oh God, that you would bless your children, oh God, that if we said or did anything that wasn't like you, Lord, and oh God, that you would forgive us and you would help us, oh God, to be reconciled to you, Lord, that we can hear from thee tonight, Lord. We just thank you for your grace. Thank you for all of your mercy towards us. bless us just now. Bless those that are here, those that had a desire to come. Lord, the sick and afflicted. May you watch over them as well tonight. Lord, we thank you. We love you. We appreciate you for all of your goodness and your grace. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. God is good. Amen. We want to look at the book of Matthew, the 25th chapter. By the grace of God. Amen. [Music] Matthew 25 and we'll begin at the first verse. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. Mighty good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew 25 and and we'll begin at the first verse. If you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were wise took their lamps and took they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them. But the wise took oil in their vessels and with took oil in their vessels with their lamps." You may be seated. We read a little further down the fifth verse. It says, "While the bridegroom terried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, behold, the bridegroom cometh. Go ye out to meet him." Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise, "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out." But the wise answer, saying, Not so, lest there be not enough for us and you. But go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. After came afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, "Verily I say unto you, I know you not where watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh." May God have blessed the reading of his word. Tonight by the grace of God just for a moment, I want to minister on a little something I was ministering on this week and I entitled it the 10 virgins. Amen. And the subtitle subtopic the significance of the oil. Amen. The significance of the oil. You know, I don't I don't think here as we're saying the other day is just a coincidence that you know Jesus when he was talking about this parable, he brought it as as it was in the midnight hour. Amen. Because in the midnight hour, we know what the midnight signifies. is the one of going to be the darkest time of the day, right? Or the darkest the darkest time. And I know that you know where we where we're living in, you can feel the effects of the darkness today. Amen. Anybody with any any little spiritual about them can sense the darkness of the hour that we live in. You know, where the Bible declared that it would be that way that as it was in the days of Noah, so it would be today. where the men's heart was on evil, right? Evil continually. You find that even those that declare to have a little bit of religion, right? Their minds are even are are even uh on evil continually, right? They can't help themselves. So, we find that, you know, that's the hour that we live in. The Bible talked about in believe in the book of Isaiah, he was saying, "Arise and shine for thy light has come. The glory of the Lord is risen upon thee." Cuz in that hour he was saying that it was going to be darkness was going to cover the earth, right? Not only darkness going to cover the earth, but it says gross darkness was going to cover the people. So we living in an hour like we said of of darkness, midnight, right? But in that very hour Jesus here as he is talking this parable here, that very hour of the midnight hour, that would be the hour that he would call for his bride. Right? So you know as we see the the signs of the time right sometimes we wonder is it just is it just you as an individual or does the world really see the hour that we live in right many times I believe that the world itself they see it but they want to put it on the backside right because they want to see it as not happening things not taking place in our lifetime but for another time right or are You'll have those that, you know, we was looking at like the signs of of of the hour that we live in. You know, I was looking at how the the earthquake hit over there the other other week and and we were at we were on the job looking at like look a 8.8 just hit, right? And they calling for tsunamis, right? Worldwide effect looked like it was going to happen, right? But then we looked at videos of the people. You know what everybody was doing? They got their phones and their cameras and everybody headed to the coast to video this thing to see it coming. One lady said, "I went and got my grandson cuz this is a once- ina-lifetime event that he'll be able to see it." But what it is, I says, "The world has gone what? Insane, ain't it? They don't really believe that the judgments of God are hitting the earth, right? And that's why they act." We saw some of them, the surfers, they grabbed their surfboard, says they going to ride these waves. They couldn't wait. They said 30 foot, 50 foot, whatever. They wanted the highest waves to come in so they can say they surf those waves, right? I says that shows you the mind frame of the world, right? &gt;&gt; So, as we look at what are we dealing with? So, we dealing with a world that's gone insane. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Aren't we? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And then they look at you as something is wrong with you because God has kept your minds. &gt;&gt; The thing about it is I'm glad that God is, you know, and it's only by his grace. That's what we got to realize. It's only by the grace of God that he's keeping your mind sane because everybody wants to go one way, right? But yet by his spirit, he's keeping you another way, right? &gt;&gt; So I said, you know, it's a dark hour we live in, right? As I was meditating on this this uh sermon here and then I woke up and found a scene that where Russia said a earthquake that been ly not earthquake but a volcano that was lying dormant for 600 years. Now it decide it won't erupt. It erupt right and they said they think it might have been caused by the tsunamis. What it is the scripture came to my mind that the the earth is is is groaning right and travail and birth pains right until now. Now, what is it doing? It's waiting to be released from the bondage that it was put in, right? What put it in bondage? Because a man disobeyed God, right? Sin got it in that condition. And it knows that that ain't the normal condition, right? &gt;&gt; I believe that the it's getting tired, ain't it? Tired of men pulling all this resource out of, doing all this sin, getting and it ain't getting no better. It's getting wicider. Right? But I says today when you talk like that, people at job, people everywhere you go, they they look at you and they want to criticize you and say all this. But one thing about it, they don't want to uh uh uh uh come to the grips, especially with America that America is gone, right? Come on. And one day she going to have to pay for her sins. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. Call it a righteous nation. Call it whatever you want. But I I was te telling somebody the other day, I see pears on that tree. It's not an apple tree. Come on. I see watermelons. It ain't cantaloupe. No matter what you say, it is what it is, ain't it? Come on. But will they repent? They can't repent if they don't they don't believe that they're doing anything wrong. Right? And that's what it is. Blindness. The Bible declared that in this hour that the world would be what? be be he said you say are rich increased with goods have need of what nothing but won't know the real condition they in right but what it takes that's what it is God ain't we looking for big groups God is knocking on the hearts of individuals I believe that he's dealing with you as an individual knocking on your heart do you hear him knocking &gt;&gt; come on do you see the signs of the time and it's real now &gt;&gt; everybody ain't going to get in desperation you say hey that out to put them in desperation. People ain't getting in desperation. But what it is when God things happening shaking you, what is it doing? You're not you're you're not afraid of like that because you realize one thing that God is going to keep his promise. &gt;&gt; Come on. That in these times I'mma look up because my redemption is drawing nigh. But one thing I am going to do, I'm going to make sure I got enough oil to make it through this night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's be the significance, right? The Bible declared that it was 10 virgins, wasn't it? And and they was virgins. They was all, I believe, like it say clean living people, right? Sanctified, right? But but the the the the the difference was was the all, right? Come on. What did that oil? The oil signified the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come on. Clean living people, good church people, right? But the importance got to be this the significance got to be the all means everything to you. &gt;&gt; Come on. Y'all believe that the oil is everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what it is. God, I I need more than just just to be cleaned up and washed out, but I need to be filled. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. And when they see this hour approaching, God, I want more. Hallelujah. I want more than just to say top me off. I want my cup to run over. Hallelujah. That's what's going to mean more than more than all the money you got, more than all the standings you got, more than all the quotes you can quote, more than all the everything you think, right? God, the oil going to mean everything, right? You know, the Bible says that when the when the bridegroom call, right? At midnight, there was a cry made. When they talked to those other virgin, the the five wives, they says, "Our lamps have gone out." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. When they woke up, their lamps was gone out. They didn't have nothing left. Now, the Bible said, they said, "Our lamps have gone what? Out." Come on. You said they were going to church, but their lamps, you can go to church, but your lamp can be gone out. Come on. People don't want to reckon with that, but it's the truth anyhow, ain't it? Your lamp gone out. Come on. I says what it is. When you got enough oil, it'll last you more than just Friday night I jumped and I shouted, but Saturday I my lamp was gone out. Come on. No, but that oil is enough to last you Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you got oil and it's burning every single day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad I said, you know, one thing about it, you know, I was looking at something. I said, the significance of all, come on. I was I was looking at something about oil. I thought I thought this was this was stirring stirring to me. Amen. about the oil just how important oil is just in the natural oil is real important ain't it come on and that's what it is like Jesus was talking here I I said I don't believe it's just no significance that he just talking about the oil right when they went to sleep when they laid down that night that wise they knew that hey I got to have all right &gt;&gt; I got to have enough I ain't taking no chances come on people taking chances ain't they ain't taking no chances. He might call when I'm at my weakest moment, right? Hallelujah. He might call when I'm going through my worst trial. But when he calls, like the song said, I'll answer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? When he calls, I want to be able to get up and go meet that the challenge, right? I got enough oil to make it through. It's dark out there, but I believe my oil is enough to last through it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Come on. You know, I was thinking about pro Job the other day. I was reading the scriptures about Job and I said one thing about Job. I said all that Job was going through was because God had confidence in him. Come on. All that he was suffering. How was he to know all that he was going through is because God was proving to the devil that no matter what, Job going to be faithful. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't had no way to know that, did he? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But God was proving that because God knew that whatever Job had. Come on. Or whatever Job confidence and all what what Job I know that no matter what you do to him, what you put on his life, no matter how dark of an hour he going through, he going to stay faithful. Do what you want to him. I got confidence in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. You know, when you're going through your little trial and your storm, it might catch you unaware right from the beginning. But one thing I think about that no matter what, God, I'm going still trust you. No matter what, I'm going still love you. I'm going still faithful. Still still be faithful. And if I got things that I don't know about in my life, God, show me so I can make them right. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Because no matter what, I want to stay with you, God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let everybody else go where they want, do what they want. God, I want to stay with you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You brought me. Hallelujah. From a mighty long way. Should have been dead. &gt;&gt; Come on. Should have been on drugs. &gt;&gt; Should have been cast away by God. Hallelujah. Who was rich in mercy. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's enough to love him all of my days. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, one of the guys at work, they had a big debate the other day. It got kind of heated and I had to say, "Hey, hey y'all, let's just call stop. Hold on." Now, one of the guys got up and he walked out. One of the guys at work, he said, "Ernest, you know what the problem is?" He said, "That guy right there, he want to live his life like you live your life." He says, "How you don't smoke, you don't drink, you don't even indulge in the conversations. That's why we don't even talk about certain things around you because he said no matter what you real, right? He said that he he want to live his life like that so bad that he get mad with himself when when he makes mistakes, right? I said, but you know what? That's a good thing that people see your life and they want to be like you, right? I said, but you got to mark the perfect man, right? Which is Christ. I said, the thing about it is you can try all you want. You'll never be able to live this life because I can't live it. I said it ain't me, but it's what's inside of me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. It's living its life through me. You only seeing what's in me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It ain't me. I tried before and I failed. But you got to realize that I can't do it. I need him to come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is the one that's living his life through me. So many people are trying and they failing and they get mad with everybody else around them, right? But what I say today, give it over to God. Hallelujah. Let God know I can't do it. God, I need you to come in. It's not me, but it's Christ that's living in me. Hallelujah. You see what you're seeing. It's only Oh, hallelujah. It's only God on the inside working on the outside, something inside. Hallelujah. Changing you. That's what it's got to be. That's why you can live freely. Hallelujah. That's why you can live. Why? Because it's him and you controlling you, right? He's got a little it's a little bumper in there. He'll check you. Hallelujah. You try to go too far right to the left, nobody ain't got to be there. You watch. Come on. He going to check you. Right. The inside teaches a bumper. Hey, you getting too far. Hey, you moving too far. Hey, get back. Get back. Hallelujah. It's him on the inside. &gt;&gt; Keeping me in step. Hallelujah. Keeping me in line. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. That's what it is. That's why I got joy unspeakable and full of glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on. &gt;&gt; But what it is, it's God. How many believe that tonight? It is. It's so easy. Like they they got a little song. They say it's so easy to love him because he's wonderful. Hallelujah. It's so easy. It's so easy to serve God. Why is it so easy to serve God? Cuz once he come in, Hallelujah. And he begin to open up your eyes to all the all the things, right? The blessings they come freely, right? With the trials come blessings. You understand that I'm only going through Hallelujah. God is taking me through. Somebody was somebody was talking to me the other week. They was telling me about all they going through. And then when this happened after this, this this and that. And I started laughing. They said, "What's you know, they want to know what's funny?" I said, "You ain't going through nothing. Ain't nobody else been through." Come on. Everybody goes through that. It's just how you handle. See, one thing about it, when I'm going through it, I already know who Jehovah Gyra is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. He's Jehovah Gyra. Amen. He my When I'm going through, I ain't worried about it. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra. Hallelujah. Jehovah Gyra, my provider. Come on. When I start feeling pain, come on. Jehovah Raf. Come on. Jehovah. All these. He's still that same God, ain't he? &gt;&gt; I like how he told Moses. He says, "You tell him that I am." Hallelujah. That's going to be my name throughout all the generations. Why? Because he ain't going to change. He's still all powerful. He's still the same God. &gt;&gt; Come on. And you got to believe that. People don't believe that today. That's why they go through the way they do. Hallelujah. But when you believe it, it's simple. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Come on. God is good, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. I says, "But what it is today, out of all the things, remember we said those virgins, they slumbered and slept, right? Come on. But when the crowd was made, come on. When it was time to get out of here, hallelujah. They all woke up, but some of them didn't have what it take to make it through it, did they?" But then I says the significance of the oil. I want to read this a little bit of this. It says you know in the natural just how important oil is says in the natural oil remains a crucial resource of the modern world is primarily as a fuel for transportation. It's a key ingredient to countless products says it fuels vehicles, heats our homes and is a foundation for many plastics, medicines and every and all other everyday items. While its dominance is being challenged by renewable energy sources, oil's impact on the global economy in daily life is still substantial. You know, I started thinking about how I didn't even realize oil, they use oil for just about everything. And that's why they're so afraid that one day, hallelujah, it might run out. So, what they trying to do, they're trying to do all they can to replace it. Come on, find something to replace it. But as I was just digging into this natural oil, hallelujah, and how important it is, I says, "But yet, people don't realize how important the spiritual oil is." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. They don't realize that that that like it says that natural oil is substantial to all your daily life. They don't realize how much that spiritual oil is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's what gets me give me joy in the morning. It's what wakes me up in the evening. Come on. And it's what keeps me going from day to day. It's my necessary me. It's all that I'm going to need, right? Because you can even have the letter, but the letter will kill you. You got to have the spirit. Hallelujah. To quicken the letter to bring it to life. &gt;&gt; That is more than just what you reading. Hallelujah. But it's coming out the pages of the book. Hallelujah. It's alive. That's was what I live by. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't just telling you something that I'm just reading. But I experienced it, brother. Hallelujah. Or sister, come on. Oh, Jesus. It's real. It speaks to me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It isn't just that you praying. No. No. He speaks to me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I'm in need, God speaks to me. Hallelujah. When I'm just walking on my daily that go. God speaks to you. Hallelujah. How does he speaks to He speaks to you through everything. &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. I tell you this right here. I was I was the other day riding on. I tell you, God speaks through everything. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was riding on the road the other day. A big old bug just fell on the windshield. Big huge looked like a cross between a manis and a I don't know what else. Brother Gerald, but he was I said, "I'm going to ride fast as I can to try to get him to fly off the car." Right. Fast as I would ride, he was holding on. Right. I started thinking about a sermon. I'm still holding on. Hallelujah. Come on. See, that might not stir nobody else, but I was stirred in the car. I said, "Those winds are coming stronger, but he holding on now." &gt;&gt; One of his legs got up, but he was still holding on. I I got stirred up in the car. I said, "No matter how hard the wind blow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. See, y'all laughing at me, sir. &gt;&gt; But I must be crazy all by myself. I said, "I'm holding on now." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's midnight. Come on. The earth is shaking. The quakes are Things are hitting, but I'mma hold on. Hallelujah. And when I can't hold on no longer, I believe God will hold on to me. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. I believe that with all of my heart. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you find that I said the significance of the oil. Come on. That all that oil became the most vital thing, didn't it? Come on. And it is the most vital thing today. I thought about I says, you know, they trying their best to find something to replace it. And I thought about in the spiritual realm. I said, "Even today, people trying their best to replace the Holy Ghost." Come on. Church is trying their best to replace it, ain't they? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Replacing it with songs, replacing it with this, replacing it with a shout, a little formal dance. It'll never replace the Holy Ghost. Come on. It'll never replace the power. Come on. But they trying to find something cuz they feel like it's going to run out. But one thing about it, it's a well that'll never run dry. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Everybody else saying, "Oh, that's just of the past. It ain't like that no more." That's because you hadn't gone deep enough. Hallelujah. But when you go through and you go deep enough, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
