every way Lord and father God will be looking to you now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray you amen the book of Deuteronomy 30. 11 through 19. I read the first you read the next together again we thank God for the sister-in-law was in glad you see Dr Norwoods this morning and all of you amen that press your way out amen Outreach 11s and we'll read through the 19th it says Deuteronomy 30. well this commandment which I've commanded thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it for all 12. neither is it Beyond the Sea that thou should it say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it 14. see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and Evil 16. but if by and hard turn away and so that thou will not hear but shall be drawn away and worship of the Gods and serve them 18. together I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before the life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that thou May born see build God bless everybody praise God Amen he said I set before your life and death in other words we have a a the freedom of choice we can choose to live or choose to to die but it's all we were teaching the little Sunday school class A little I said Sunday school but we have it on Tuesday they look classy God said I set before your life and death in the beginning we understand that God put the tree of knowledge and good and evil there and uh he said every tree of the garden you may freely eat but of the tree of knowledge and good and even the day you touch it the day you eat of it you're gonna die amen but it was their own Freedom of Choice you give us free will it gave us the free will to choose Lie To Live or to die and Adam and Eve made the wrong choice so God gives us back to the same Choice he gave out of need we can choose to live or we can choose to die he gives us the freedom of choice you know they have what we call the the freedom uh abortion rights or whatever and you know they can choose to abort they can choose not to abort and then this is you know all of that going on in the political Romania about um abortion rights freedom of choice and um but we have to choose we have free will and that's what I want to deal with you have a free will you you you can choose to serve God uh choose not to serve God is God gives us that freedom so with that freedom I want to go to Acts 9. Acts 9. in free will you know in one place God said you have not chosen me but I've chosen you are you with me I'm glad God made a choice to choose me amen and he could have choose chose somebody else but he chose me amen and there that God chose me he's that means that God foreknew me and God foreknew you and I believe if you're God's choice then he said my sheep know my voice said they hear my voice amen so you understand it amen God has called you for a special reason for a special purpose and this morning amen you have freedom a choice you have the freedom Amen to accept what the word says or to reject it that's your prerogative you can do it or you can say well I choose to you know to do what I want to do as we say God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life we can choose whether we want it or we don't want it to believe it or not to believe it amen it's because we don't believe it amen we can't receive it but if we believe what God says about it then amen God said I'm going to bless you in other words if we choose the other route it comes with you said good choose life choose good choose evil and you choose it down are you with me so it's your choice if we die it's not God's fault if we Allah you know a lot of things in life we go through is because of the choices we make the choices we make Amen to not to do what God says and and the choices we make to do what we want to do are you with me Jesus said not my will amen but let thy will be done so when we're talking about free will we talk about sometimes the will of God uh you know our will are we talking about perfect will permissive will amen we're talking about you have a choice it's your will permissive will Free Will of you know the will of God but Jesus said not my will you know and a lot of times the trouble we get in in life is because it's we do our own will sometimes we go through life and sometimes folks go through life a long time and then never find the will of God for their life they never find it they just always searching for God why am I here what is your plan what is the what what is God saying to me I I want the will of God to be done in my life how many of you want the will of God to be done in your life I want the will of God to be done in my life God I know I have my choice is amen Lord I want to please you I want your way to be done I want God's will to be done in my life that's what I want that's what I desire but I just don't want the permissive will I want God's perfect will for me amen I want I I want what God wants for me amen it may not be what my flesh want but it's what God wants I'm willing to accept God's purpose amen uh sister Keisha was singing on Friday you know take up your cross and follow him you know what I'm saying and that's what I I I I I I I I I thought about that you know when I was prepared take up your cross and follow him amen don't be ashamed Amen to say that you know him take up your cross and follow him amen you you must be willing to take up your cross and follow Jesus and don't be ashamed of it amen Paul said I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it's the power of God's salvation to have a one to believe praise God are you with me the Josh you might have to help me a little bit this morning uh I said acts 9 and 1 it says and both we know y'all brother Josh both of y'all get a mic and I saw yet excuse me and Saul yet breathing uh threatening and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went into the high priest and desired of him letters to the Masters to the synagogue that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them what bound to Jerusalem and as he's journeyed he came near the Masters and selling their shine round about him a light from where from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecuted who amen he was persecuting the one that he was supposed to be serving amen the one that he was supposed to be uh you know he made a choice amen maybe he was he was born in the Jewish Family and he knew they taught him about the true and living God the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and and yet he he he thought that that God he was defending God you know I'm gonna tell you something you know a lot of times we try to defend what we believe we try to stand on the defendant I'm gonna tell you sir God don't need no help from us oh you look man some people get upset they're trying to defend uh the message of the hour they're trying to defend brother Brandon being the prophet and and messenger before the age is trying to defend they spent all that time defending and fussing and who's writing who's wrong and who's this and just go and preach Jesus because that ain't gonna save nobody Jesus is a savior and what he did on the cross the blood of Jesus amen at the end of the road amen souls are out there need to be saved people need to make a decision that I'm gonna choose life I'm gonna choose them are you with me if you're going to choose Jesus amen why everybody's fussing that sinner is on his way to hell because nobody's saying to you choose life are you with me you got freedom of choice choose Jesus amen Jesus died for your sins Jesus cares about you Jesus love you well we're so busy defending what you believe amen and that's what Paul was he was defending that he was a Pharisee he was defending that hey these people come and talk about uh uh uh uh another God and I'm serving the true Living God I know that this is the real genuine God amen that I'm serving he was convinced that his his church amen his denomination what he believed was right amen and he was uh I I got letters from they made the high priest I'm going down and I'm binding and whether it be men or women I'm putting them in jail I'm in defense I'm standing in the defense and you know people get mad at folks they want to hurt you they get oh God they can get ugly amen if you you know if you don't believe like they believe and you you're not going the way they think you ought to go they get mad at you you know Jesus of many times he shows the love of God he didn't try to force anybody to you know to accept him he said whosoever well amen I said you got freedom of choice he said whosoever will let him come are you with me he's not willing that is your parents but all should come to repentance you have a free will you don't have to believe what I believe amen but you do have to believe that Jesus Christ saves that he died for your sin you you you need to believe that but if you don't want to believe in him and I believe it amen I believe that Jesus shattered his blood I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God I believe amen I believe the gospel is the power of God to Salvation tell everyone to believe praise God I believe oh God I believe if you believe amen praise God and you're convinced of and convicted of it I believe it brings about a change in your life amen praise God I believe a power come inside you I believe in an energized you I believe something to Quicken you I believe it'll change your life praise God he said choose life amen I set before your life and death you choose amen Freedom of Choice Saul said saw he said and if and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying Saul saw why persecuted not me and he said now he's supposed to know he said who or what who are you now he he didn't say anybody who said who are thou Lord amen he was talking to God who are you Lord God who are you Lord for you God because he knew the light that was shining it was God so he wasn't speaking about I don't know who this is he knew who amen when he saw that light and he fell to the Earth he knew that was gone are you with me it's something about when God stopped you you know it's God you know it's not man speaking to you you know it's God that's speaking to you praise God you know when you come if you ever got saved before if you ever amen come in contact with God have you ever experienced you knew amen when God called you it was his voice it spoke to you that made the change in your life you heard amen sometimes somebody said I heard something in the inside began to say to me amen it's your time now give your heart to the Lord you might have been 10 you might have been nine you could have been six you could have been 12 you could have been 15 you could have been 50. amen but nevertheless when he spoke you knew it was God Amen in the evidence and the proof that is it was God Amen he came in and he made a change amen God made a change in my life I chose I chose when I heard him I chose to obey him amen I chose to accept what he called me praise God many of us amen we make a a choice but we don't stay with our choice our decision that we make to choose Christ sometimes we don't hold fires to it sometimes we just say well Lord I I I believe it's you calling me but uh you know I'm coming but you don't come all the way there's something about when you don't come all the way you bring an excessive baggage you know after a while sooner or later amen things that happen in life that'll cause you to fall back but when you see the light amen praise God Hallelujah when you see God as being amen oh like you know it's something about you know sometimes we can make we can see men as trees and then we can see men as they oh we can we can see uh through glass partially amen but it's something to see God in a perfect way well you said when that was just perfect it's come that which is in part should be done away with it's sometimes we partly believe it we we partly want to accept it we partly want to serve God but when we fully persuading in our minds and in our hearts Lord I'm fully persuaded it is you praise God if you come and you can keep me amen God if you amen chose a man then God you're able to keep amen that's why Paul said I'm persuaded he's able that keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I I'm talking about what you know is God the god that saves you is the god that is able to keep you from falling amen you don't have to worry about falling God Amen if you can shame me you can keep me Hallelujah thank you Jesus so many times I tell the folks that the sick on the sick bed I said if you believe God for your your salvation he changed your life and bought you out of the nightclub and bought you out of the streets and save you from your sins I said don't you know that that same God said with his stripes you heal so why are you worrying about your sickness amen God that savior is the same God that says amen he was wounded for our transgression not only for our sin he was bruised from our nicotine his chest time that our peace was upon with his stripes you heal I said you're healed brother you're healed sister praise God why are you wiring you're healed because you believe you're saved you believe you're healed amen if you can believe you're saved you ought to believe you're healed because the same word said you save in the same word that say you're healed are you up but whose report will you believe amen says I'm Jesus in that persecuted it's hard for thee to kick against debris and he's trembling and it started said Lord what would I help me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into his City and it shall be told thee what thou must do amen you know when God called you amen he says come and follow me told his disciples they were fishing he said come and follow me as we look at as I talk a little bit Romans I mean acts 22 acts 22 and 10 but Josh um acts 22 and 10. now as God calls us you know he calls us to follow him he said the Peter and John Peter James and John deputies children said come amen and I'll make you a fisherman a man are you with me you ever seen God called somebody that wasn't doing nothing he called Matthew the tax collector Luke deposition he called people that were doing things amen people that was you know just laying out not doing anything but God called when God called it's a purpose in him calling you God got a plan for you your life amen and I believe God's plan is to bless you it's the blessing plan amen not like all the prosperity preachers talk about but I believe God wants to give you amen a land of prosperity

doubt God they may trust the Lord with all thy heart and lean back to that I won't understand and all that way he's acknowledge Him and he will direct thy man I'm so glad I'm trusting him amen follow me he says amen praise God I believe that um Paul came to that place that he was falling yeah amen he had free will but his will was to be what he was born a Pharisee amen and he was going to stay up for our season but God had another plan aren't you glad God had another plan for your life praise God it doesn't matter how religious we were or how good we thought we were and keeping all the church standards but God Amen wanted you to be his sons and his daughters praise God Amen church was all right amen but God had something better than just going to church God Amen wanted you Amen to have the present truth amen for the hour that he lived in amen that was a word that was a fresh word that was a fresh anointed word that was a conquest word where the caucus is that where the Eagles be gathered amen that was something new Amen in their hour it wasn't amen something that he meant was uh uh uh oh oh but it was a new thing that God was doing amen God was bringing them from law Amen to Grace amen but it was hard amen for them to understand because they had the law amen and you couldn't tell them that they didn't have the law because Paul said concerning the law I was a blame aimless amen amen I kept the Lord Faithfully amen and you couldn't tell me the law wasn't right because God gave it to Moses and I'm standing on what God gave to Moses and if God was good enough for Moses and give me four Moses it was Israel and amen before Israel it was Abraham amen amen praise God Hallelujah and see what I'm saying he can look back and see what amen he can look back in the backwards amen and then he but he couldn't understand what was happening right then we can understand this there's no religion this new thing this new God that he was worshiping what's going on what's going on here y'all worshiping another God ain't gonna have that you think I'm gonna take that I'm gonna stand up for my God because it was a revelation that was breaking when Revelation is breaking it's hard for amen people to understand when God is removing amen the doubts and the fears he gotta amen send a messenger before amen Jesus amen before his pain he said amen to declare amen that Jesus Christ amen he said the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand repent John with a message of the voice of one crying in the wilderness but yet amen who want to believe that it was structured by dating an obstructive voice John the messenger Elijah amen had come Jesus said if you can receive he was Elijah amen but what happened they didn't want to receive him so what if they didn't receive John Shirley they wouldn't believe Jesus amen I believe that the ministry of Jesus Christ is the Minister of the Bride amen I believe that you and I am in uh hallelujah we're given the same Ministry amen the hell has come to the body the word has come amen he said father make them warn even as we are one I believe this is headship time I believe that we're coming into the Oneness of God I believe that in order for him to be married he want to be married back to the word I don't want I don't think he's going to marry he meant something uh other than the word and I believe you got to become the word bride amen you become Mrs Jesus Christ isn't that because you are the same bone of his mouth flesh of his flesh the light of his life Spirit of his Spirit same God doing the same things praise God with the same kind of love with the same kind of life praise God knowing who you are recognizing Who You Are praise God not another Jesus but the same Jesus praise God where is he he's in you Christ in you the hope of glory amen praise God let somebody see Jesus Amen Let Your Light Shine Amen Let somebody seize Jesus it's not me to live but it's Christ that liveth in me I choose a life remember I choose I need my

goodness of God will lead man to repentance Lord you love me that kind of way what can I do for you when you care that much about me to be spit on and oh ridicued and persecuted What Can I Do Lord

things for me amen I know it was God that born me amen I couldn't bring myself I know it's God he meant that kept me amen I know it was Jesus the above me amen I hope you know who he was amen when you didn't understand but now you know praise God as Jesus that kept you amen Amen brother Josh is telling me his testimony he said I know it was God down in Atlanta Georgia but God bought him out amen

living and not even caring it wasn't not God has a plan God has a purpose not action not coming sincerely say God do you have a plan do you have a purpose I believe everyone that God calls he has a plan he has a purpose for your life I don't believe he called you to be idle I don't believe he call you and save you just to amen just to come to church and pay your tithes and offer and I believe God has a plan God has a purpose amen see sometimes we got to just ask God God what are you what is your plan what is your purpose if you don't know your plan and your purpose you might just go about

turn around God's so good to me I can't turn around remember my brother is saying that no no no I can't turn around God's been so good to me then my other brother singing to me another day amen see I made a vow to the Lord amen sometimes uh you know we got to understand we we made a commitment not to the church not to the preacher but to God amen you made that decision that you're going to serve the Lord I heard you know the problems as for me in my house Joshua we're gonna serve the Lord amen it's my decision My Free Will nobody making me he said choose you to stay home you're gonna serve amen I made a decision I'm gonna serve the Lord praise God that's what I mean my decision I'm gonna serve you Lord amen you got that decision to me okay Josh Lord have mercy help me and when I could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me I came into Damascus and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the Jews that dwelt there come unto me and stood and said unto me brother Saul received thy sight and that same hour I looked upon him and said and he said the god of our fathers you know so hold for a minute you know God Jesus God could have given him his sight right then amen right but God let him go to or what analyze why why he did that see sometimes God wants us to know amen that you not only you're not the only Pebble on the beach you're not the only one that God got people that he's dealing with ananias didn't want to receive him he said I heard that this man persecute the church I'm scared of it God said no you ain't got to feel me all right I don't know I didn't touch him even God doesn't test you when God touched you you all right amen he he coming to you now the night to Heaven he's not coming to her now nice and put him in jail but he's coming for help he blind amen he want to see again see because what the his eyes were sin and what his ears with him and what is horrible to receive it wasn't right but he thought it was brother and sister I'm gonna tell you something amen praise God he thought he was doing the will of God he thought that he had made the right decision when he went down to the Masters but amen he was on his own free will nobody told Saul I want you to go down there ah I was zealous for the Lord you know I got a Zeal for God you know you get those folks that's really Zeus for their church and zealous amen for the ministry that they have and knowing that amen I'm gonna stand up well maybe I was standing for my church I'm standing for my pastor I'm standing for the prophet I'm staying oh come on I was standing for Jesus amen sometimes folks look like some of the meanest people standing up for Jesus you know Jesus ain't mean like that Jesus Took the ride or forgive them because they know not what they do praise God instead of holding something here and against your brother sister just say forgive them because they know not what they do they don't understand Lord help them and then you know uh uh uh uh Stephen said when Saul was consented and they were thrown in him he said lay this not at their what charge don't you lay that they charge because you know I believe God heard his prayer don't lay it to their charge amen praise God you know sometimes if God were to leave some things to our charge we all amen have sinned and come short of the glory of God and if God will lay some to our charge don't you know what would happen to us if God was you know the minute you make a mistake and don't say you don't make none because you might make wonderful you leave out amen the minute you make a mistake that's why I said God is your grace to save me every day is because you love me you forgive me amen but see sometimes we can't forgive one another are you a man because sometimes folk amen do things that they don't mean to do are you with me and you say well yeah I know they mean no no even if they meant forgive them are you with me and don't lay it to their charge just stay you know Saul knew what he was doing it's all good Stephen didn't take the attitude Stephen said what don't lay it to the way they're charged are you with me I'ma say your worst enemy the one that you think hates you the most get it enough Grace in your heart to say Lord don't worry don't lay it to their charge amen don't you lay that to their charge amen God bless them amen because you it may be a saw that you're dealing with that God is holding you accountable that you release it from their charge are you with me and God might want to re-establish that brother didn't use him as a faithful brother in The Gospel of sister amen God want to use them for his glory are you with me so are y'all with me ain't God good sometimes we ain't there yet but we got to get there because amen if we're going to be the Bride of Jesus Christ it's going to be changed in the moment of twinkling eye we got to get where we need to be and that is in The Headstone that's perfect love and The Headstone come to the body amen and that's what God is calling you and I to headship amen becoming one with him that's perfect love that's the Capstone are you with me go ahead old brother Josh the god of our fathers has chosen thee that thou should know of his will and see see that well that's his will free will to know God's will is to know that you have free will that God has made you free are you with me he freed us from our sins that you might know his will because he thought he knew the will he didn't a lot of times we think that we know God's will but God has to stop us long enough he said that you might know the will go ahead and see that just one and should hear his voice of his mouth go ahead for thou shall be his witness unto all men what thou has seen and heard and how thou tariff thou doubt and why Terry's uh arise and be baptized and wash away what that I've seen the see he said be baptized and wash away your sin are you with me amen somebody says don't wash it with your sins that's what he said didn't it you believe it arise and be baptized and what wash away thy sin call in on the name of the Lord Lord and it came to pass that when I was come again to Jerusalem even while I prayed in the temple I was in a trance see God moving I pray God moved with us that you have no Assurance of God that God makes himself known to you as a true and living God not something you read about in the Bible but something that amen you know about God presently working in your life moving in your life Supernatural happenings God Amen being God Amen you can't go off somebody else's experience that's what happens sometimes we Jesus said follow me well somehow we following everything but him going off of different people experience you got to have your own personal experience are you with me God I want to know your will and your plan for me okay the 18th verse said and I saw him saying unto me May Hayes and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem for they were what not received our testimony concerning me you know it's something that God you know and God working with him but you know they ain't gonna receive you that's what he told them right then he says and I said Lord they know that I am that I in prison and be in every synagogue them that believe on thee get this this was a tough fella ain't it he's doing for what he believed and some folk kill you for what they believe you tell folks that um being in sororities in the Masons and all that stuff ain't right tell them again you know it ain't right you know to be uh men with men and women with women some folk could kill you you tell them the truth they want to kill you are you a man you're just saying what the Bible says it's nothing against them it's individuals right you're just trying to tell them the truth or the word well folks get upset with you mad at you angry and want to hurt you because what they want to justify their own because the light has not shined in them yet as the lights was given to Paul he saw the light and when you see the light you see that it'll lead you in the right direction he said the 20th verse it says and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shared I also standing by and consenting unto his what you see see how far folk can go with thinking they're right Heaven get a man stoned to death because you think you're right Jesus didn't do this forgive him the love of God in your heart will never cause harm or damage to nobody on purpose I am not saying you not don't offend in word or indeed amen but on purpose you see what I'm saying the love of God in your heart because sending them to his death and kept the remedy of them that slew him and he said unto me depart for I will Cindy fall hints unto the what Gentiles amen see God got a plan and a purpose he found out amen God what would thou have me to do what is your will what is your plan we got to come to that same place in our lives God what is your will what is your plan what what would thou help me to do amen I want to know amen other than that I'm just going to come to church I'm just going to go out I'm just going to sing a song I'm just going to preach a sermon I'm just going to do that but God it is something far beyond that what is your will what is your plan do you have a purpose amen for my life I do I want to know it no no I'm not interested you know sometimes we're not interested no no no no no no no please don't call me because I ain't ready you know Jeremiah when God was speaking to Jeremiah did I make you a prophet to the nation he said I'm a child he said don't you say that I'm a child God knew what he was doing amen God said I may I'll make the people as wood and make your mind like fire are you with me God called amen God called a child amen and God said I knew you amen before your mother before you came into your mother's womb I knew you are you with me and God knows every one of us and you know we can't tell God when to call you call us sweet to the when did I get old God wait you know tomorrow's not promised to you the day you hear his voice hard not your heart when God called you you just got to be willing to say God I am I you know Samuel didn't know that God was calling him Eli said when he called you say here am I Lord because he didn't know the law was speaking to him he hadn't heard the voice of the Lord so the law was speaking to him but he thought it was Eli calling him he said here my Lord amen he and then he was open God Amen had some words to speak to him to use him as a child amen we can't dictate to God and tell God when to move in our lives when to choose us God Amen because God got a better plan you might have a plan for your life you might have some things you
