supply every need according to your riches and Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen 2 Thessalonians 1 2 Thessalonians 1 and two Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we are bound to thank God always for you brethren as it is meat because that your faith growth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all towards each other abounded so that we ourselves glory in you in the Church of God for your patient and faith in all your persecution and tribulation that ye endure which is a manifest token of the righteous Judgment of God that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which ye also suffer sin it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you and to you you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking Vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall be punished with Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you which bleed in that day wherefore also we pray always for you that your God would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of Faith with power that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you for you may be seated in the fifth verse he says which is a manifest token of the righteous Judgment of God that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which also for which ye also suffered amen so from that we want to talk to you we want to also look at Luke here the 14th chapter and uh we want to talk to you about is your life worthy of the Gospel is your life worthy of the Gospel it's up to you to you know to examine your walk with God and to the Bible said if we judge ourselves we will not be condemned with the world he said judgment begins at the house of God so you and I must examine ourselves that we might be kind of worthy of the kingdom of God so here in uh Luke 14 and 16 then said he then said he unto the him a certain man made a great at supper and bid many and sent his servant at supper time to say unto them that were bidden what did he say come and all things are what not ready all things are not ready and they all with one consent began to what does that sound like some of us God is inviting you but they made what ex excuses the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground I got to go work and I must need to go and see it I pray thee have me what excuse have me excuse and another said I have bought a five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee what ex God is inviting but people are saying I ain't got time I don't have time for you Lord can you excuse me have me excuse and another said I have married a what therefore I cannot what I can't come you know it's many reasons why people can't come why they can't come to God why they won't give their life even though Christ is inviting you to give your heart to give your life to him he's inviting you to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the invitation is yours he's inviting but who's taking advantage of this great supper that he's prepared everybody want to go to the marriage supper of the Lamb everybody want to go to heaven but when he invites you and he says the invitation you got an excuse why not well I can't be baptized uh you know I'm not I got an excuse what is your excuse Shake somebody hand say what's your excuse see because they had excuses didn't they surely you have an excuse for why you're not saved or why you're not serving the lord you certainly got to have some kind of excuse they had excuses didn't they so what is your excuse okay okay we have an invitation the subject is your is your life worthy of the Gospel are you with me but they had excuses I married a wife and got time for that I got to see you know I married a wife I ain't got time for God I married a wife I know you you you're calling me I know I need to give my all to you I've need to give my life to you but you know I'm I'm married a wife wife and I'm busy with my wife so I ain't I got an excuse okay so that the servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being what you don't think God is angry when he gives you the invitation you don't think God is angry with you he invites you you to come on in the Kingdom to give your life to Jesus he invites you and then he said he got angry because he inviting you to the great marriage supper he's inviting you to have eternal life you don't think he's angry you think he's ah okay you know if you made a great Supple and you inviting guest and none of them want to come and all this you done went through cooking and preparing and all and then all of a sudden you invite them and they said I don't want to oh I got this to do I got that to do I got other things to do and huh you know the marage supper of the Lamb the you know what I'm saying he's made this great feast for you and I amen and and you not you don't want it this great feast that God has prepared for you and you turn it down and that's the way it is people are say I'm sorry I'm full I I I already ate what are you eating the things of the world are you eating at the wrong table and not the table of the Lord are you with me are you so busy and so full up with the things of the devil and the things of the world that you don't want to be invited you you that you can't come to God God's invitation to give your life and your heart to him have you already gave it to the devil you know God's servant God Prophet said one day he the invitation it ain't going to always be there one day he invite you for the last time and you'll be locked out spiritually locked out spiritual death would set in you'll be locked out you can't come then you can want to come but you won't be able to come because you turned down the invitation for the last time he said every time you hear that time when God invites you he said one day you'll turn it down for the last time one day you'll tell God no the last time and you'll be spiritually locked out because you turn it down see God dealt with the the Jews he was saying this par to the Jews he invited them but they turned him down they rejected Jesus didn't they amen y'all remember the days of Noah he invited them to come in N what did they do they turned it down what happened the flood came isn't that right so you're going to turn God down for the last time and not all the time you physically amen but spiritually death can set in you can come to church you can hear the message and you say I believe it yes that's right I believe it to believe and not re respond they say I know it's right but I don't respond for the last time you hear God's voice call you one day you hear his voice for the last time call you and when you hear his voice for the last time call you it'll all be over you you don't have to worry about him worrying you no more you don't have to worry about the preacher begging you no more if you feel like he's begging you you don't have to worry about Mama telling you a daddy telling you a husband a wife you're here for the last time one time and that last time it'll all be over with then so when you hear his voice for the last time call you and you turn it down you rejected God you re rejected his call you too busy on your phone in the church you couldn't hear God some somebody says are you too busy look at somebody ask me they too busy somebody look at me cuz you looking at every other thing look at me I want to see you are you too busy are you with me y'all all right you're not too busy are you you turn him down for the last time the last time I know somebody somebody I believe in here and somebody under the sound of my voice going to turn God down for the last time they're going to reject God for the last time and not even know that their day of visitation that God that turn down the day of visitation when God has visit you for the last time and you didn't know your day of visitation you didn't know that you would never have the opportunity again because you turned down God for the last time you live a little longer but you'll never hear the voice of God call you the way he's calling you now all you hear your heart is hard but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but you'll never hear his voice you want to come but you can't come you'll want to serve him but you won't be able to serve him he'll knock for the last time he'll knock at the door of your heart for the last time and when he knocks at the door of your heart for the last time that is over it's over spiritually it's over he'll knock for the last time you turn him down one time too many you turn God down one time too many so he was angry wasn't he angry amen when you prepared this great supper how what about the Lord so he was angry and said unto his servant what go out what into the street you know I believe that God is telling us to go quickly to the street cuz sometime the folks in the church don't want him sometime the people in the church don't want God so he said go quickly unto the to the street you know it'll be something you go quickly to the street and just bring in every kind of thing and see he said bring in all kind what what kind he want you to go quickly into the street and and and and the what in the lanes of the city and bring in hither the what the pole the what the main and the what and the blind see look at the I don't think we got all of that in here now and maybe we're not got we don't have those that's under the sound of a voice but there are those that Halk man blind and all of that they got all kind of things wrong with them but he said go to them and go get them because these that are here don't they're not worthy they don't you don't they don't they don't seem to be worthy but go and get them are you with me go get somebody that's going to praise me amen go get somebody that's going to be grateful and thankful go get somebody that want to come to the supper go get somebody that want a feast with me go some go get somebody to appreciate me go get somebody that's going to praise me Hallelujah go get them Hallelujah I want somebody that's going to do something am go get them and it's servant said Lord it is what done as thou commanded and yet there is what yet there's room and the Lord said unto the servant go into the what and what compel them to come in amen the people that was in see the Jews that were bitten to come didn't they didn't recognize the Messiah they called him bzo they called him the devil are you with me are you with me see you see what people do when they got they me Jesus has come to them amen in the form of the revelation of the word and they turn him down because they already got something to take the place of that are you with me they already had Pharisees they already had their s sees they already had so when Jesus came on the scene they rejected him amen because they already had their own type of PE preachers and everything that they were worshiping so when the messenger of that day or the messenger of the Covenant came when Jesus came amen stepped out of Eternity in the time and came to a virgin amen they called him born of fornication amen and Jesus every time he said now you had the prophets and you rejected them all so what about Jesus they going to reject Jesus and they killed the prophets and reject all that God sent them and when Jesus came amen what did they do to him the same thing they turned down every Prophet that God sent to them I'm going tell you amen the church are lay out is sealed in this age at this time people are turning the gospel down the last time I don't know what but I I you you know I I I I feel like all that the father has given me will come amen those that ordained to eternal life will come somebody's going to wake up am somebody going to want God with all their heart somebody going to cry out to God God I Want To Praise You Lord I know you're real lord I know you're my savior you're my father you my God yes Lord Jesus I know you my help yes Lord Hallelujah somebody going to do it praise God those that are set down still amen right oh Hallelujah we won't have our religious AR religious spirit but you will worship God in spirit and Truth praise God the woman said our fathers Worship in this mountain amen but I want to get you away from the mountain amen Amen to you Amen to to to this place of comfort amen yeah my our fathers Worship in the mountain and the Jews said we ought to Worship in Jerusalem but she didn't know what hour she was in amen she didn't know she didn't recognize her day as of yet but God knew that uh amen she had representation by predestination so he had need to go by Samaritan and he had need to talk to that woman because that woman had a situation in her life and she was thirsting for something she didn't know what she needed at the time but it was something that deep called to the deep and there was a deep to respond there was a God that was responding am me to a hard cry amen praise God she searched but she couldn't find it but Jesus found her didn't he amen and same Jesus will find you amen he'll meet you where you are amen he'll go out and seek and save them that are lost go out to the hedes and Highway and compel them to come amen hallelujah I'm going to compel them to come amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah I feel like that in my spirit compelling them to come y'all come on in praise God come on in the honger the drug aded the crackhead or what you call amen come on in because they got too many good people too many people that got all the good they all right we need some people that need God that want God that want to serve him yes that want to be delivered they said I have no need I'm all right the invitation for them was turned down so he says go to the highways and compel them to come to come in that my house may be what filled amen go get them for I say un you that none of what which were what see your invitation none of those men that was bid going to what none of them that was bid is going to taste of my supper are you with me could you be that one that God has invited for the last time and said that you you won't taste my Supple because when I when I call amen when I when I when I gave you the invitation you you turned it down could it be possible that God is talking to you as an individual that I'm calling you but you you don't need him you don't want him amen now is your life worthy of the Gospel you know I want to look at your life and I want to look at certain individuals in the Bible because all I hear preachers preach every time I look around is excuses that's all I hear is excuses all it seemed like the the the scripture says a bishop must be blameless the husband and one wife and his house got to be an all his children got to be in all but I I I I feel like we a short Change in the gospel I feel like we are making the gospel so weak that it's nobody that even going to respond we don't look like we want holy men we don't look like God people have taken a stand everybody look like they don't fell in sin and everybody in the church look like they they they do wrong stuff and they everybody is just you know nobody's trying to lift up a standard there's no holy people no sanctified people no more everybody got excuses that people are so weak that it ought to be somebody that's taking a stand for Holiness you know even when it comes down who can find a virtuous woman for her fice is far above rubies amen it look like people don't even care whether or not their virtues or not amen there's excuses it's all making everybody feel all right amen nobody has to amen keep themselves nobody has to have a standard anymore amen the preachers ain't got no standard so the people ain't got a standard amen we got to have a standard somebody amen that's going to lift up a standard somebody that's going to be holy somebody that's going to be Sanctified is your life worthy preachers preaching in the pull pit praise God is your life worthy people singing is your life worthy musicians is your life worthy trustees is your life worthy deacons

me there be there should be somebody that stand in the Gap and make up the heads there must be somebody that's trying to lift up a standard against the devil that must be somebody that's taking a stand amen that must somebody that's trying to Amen to be holy that must be somebody that want to be Sanctified that must be somebody that want to is your life worthy it's got to be somebody amen I I I like what he says Amen in Romans 12 it says he says I beseech you amen I beg you amen I I beeech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies the stories I hear pastors tell me uh about their lives the the stories I hear uh people tell me ministers tell me amen they all up ah I fell into sin God have everybody I don't want to hear those stories over and over look like we pacifying and trying to cover up something everybody trying to cover up something it ought to be something that amen that that that that uh you ought to live above reproach are you with me your life ought to be above reproach the people ain't coming and said I uh Pastor son s did this Minister son s did that the Min ought to have a standard amen praise God that the people can look up too amen but I see the ministers falling like flies and then the people what they're waving over the people is God forgive God have mercy God that's right but sometimes you got to you got you got to have a standard amen a life that is worthy of the Gospel somebody ought to try to be holy somebody ought to try to live a holy Sanctified life a Godly it's almost if you're doing right they almost looking at you and don't want to have nothing to do with your tful don't have nothing to do with that boy don't have nothing to do with that sister uh uh she think better than us see what you suffer for just uh keeping yourself just being holy just trying to live right because so many people have damaged themselves and it's not that they don't think yeah I I tell you I you know they they think
