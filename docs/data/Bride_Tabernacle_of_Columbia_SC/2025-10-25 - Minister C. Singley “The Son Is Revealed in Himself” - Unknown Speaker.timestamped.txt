[34:55] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[34:57] and over the fowl of the air, over the
[34:59] cattle, and over all the earth, and o
[35:02] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[35:05] upon the earth." So God created man in
[35:09] his own image and the image of God
[35:11] created he him
[35:14] male and created he them. Is that right?
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Male and female created he them.
[35:23] Is that right?
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[35:27] them, "Be fruitful and multiply and
[35:29] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[35:32] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[35:33] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[35:36] every living thing that moveth upon the
[35:38] earth." Amen.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, Revelation 81.
[35:43] Thank you, Jesus.
[36:03] The scripture says, "And when he had
[36:05] opened the seventh seal, there was
[36:07] silence in heaven about the space of
[36:10] half an hour." Amen.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he had opened the seventh
[36:14] seal, there was silence in heaven about
[36:17] the space of half an hour. Last
[36:19] scripture, Luke the 17th chapter
[36:30] starting at verse 28.
[36:32] Likewise, Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[36:37] I like hearing those pages turn. Amen.
[36:40] Amen. Jesus Christ's name. Thank you,
[36:43] Jesus.
[36:45] Luke 17
[36:48] verse 28
[36:50] it said likewise also as it was in the
[36:52] days of Lot they did eat they drank they
[36:56] bought they sold they planted they build
[36:59] but the same day that Lot went out of
[37:02] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[37:05] heaven and destroyed them all. Thus
[37:08] shall it be in the day when the son of
[37:11] man is revealed. Amen. Amen. Our lesson
[37:15] tonight is the son of man revealing
[37:17] himself is revealing himself. Amen. Let

[37:29] your word. Forgive the sin of your
[37:31] people now Lord in the name of Jesus
[37:33] Christ. Bless the word Lord Jesus. Oh

[37:39] in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you for
[37:41] your redemptive work that you've done
[37:42] for us on the cross and we accept it in
[37:45] the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Bless
[37:47] us now as we reproach you through the
[37:49] word in Jesus Christ's name we pray and
[37:51] we thank you. Let church say amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Church say amen again.

[37:58] Christ's name. Hallelujah. Amen. We that

[38:06] first scripture text scripture we read
[38:10] where God made man in his image. Amen.
[38:13] Is that right?
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. God said let us make man. A lot of
[38:16] you know um church world got that all
[38:20] mixed up and they use that to justify
[38:22] the trinity. Amen. But we know that that
[38:25] wasn't not wasn't three gods that he's
[38:26] talking to. Is that right? God was
[38:28] talking to the logos. He said, "Let us
[38:30] make man in our likeness, and let them
[38:34] have dominion over
[38:37] the fowl of the air, over the calendar,
[38:38] and over all the earth, and over every
[38:40] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[38:43] earth." Is that right? Amen. So, man was
[38:45] made in God's image. Amen. And at that
[38:48] time, God man was made spirit man. Amen.
[38:52] Because God at that time, God is a
[38:54] spirit.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is God is a spirit. And they
[38:58] that worship him must worship him in
[39:00] spirit and in truth. Amen. But right
[39:02] there, he made made man in his image.
[39:05] Amen.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; But he said male and female created he
[39:09] them. Amen.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Adam was actually made in the
[39:14] very image of God. So we know that God
[39:17] inside of God was male and female. Amen.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I know it's been said a lot
[39:24] of time that Eve was a byproduct of the
[39:26] creation. Amen. But Eve was actually
[39:29] made in the original creation in the
[39:31] spirit. Amen. Is that right? Amen. Cuz
[39:35] he God's God God made Adam in his image
[39:38] and in his im image of God was male and
[39:42] female. Amen. And he said let them have
[39:45] dominion. Amen. Amen. So we see that
[39:50] Adam and Eve Amen. Before he made Adam
[39:53] in a male physical body, Eve and Adam
[39:57] was already made in the spirit form.
[39:59] Amen. And we see that God, he gave them
[40:03] dominion. That word dominion means to
[40:06] subjugate. In other word, to rule and to
[40:09] reign, to conquer and to subdue. Amen.
[40:13] And we know that God Adam was made in
[40:15] God image. So inside of Adam was male
[40:18] and female spirit. Amen. Amen. So when
[40:22] God put Adam to sleep, then he took the
[40:24] rim out of Adam which was the spirit of
[40:27] Eve and he made the woman. Amen. In
[40:29] Jesus Christ's name. Y'all with me?
[40:31] Amen. Amen. We see in Genesis 5 2 5 and
[40:35] 8 that man became a living soul. God let
[40:39] a mist come up out of the ground and
[40:42] form man out of the dust of the ground.
[40:44] Breathe life breath into Adam and Adam
[40:47] became a living soul. Amen.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah.
[40:53] Therefore, when a person die,
[40:57] hallelujah. And they say over them ash
[40:59] to ash, dust to dust, that don't pertain
[41:03] unto the soul. That only pertains to
[41:05] that body that's going in the ground. Is
[41:07] that right? Amen. Amen. So when they say
[41:10] a dust to dust, that don't mean your
[41:12] soul. Now, amen. Hallelujah. I'm
[41:14] reminded when that young rich ruler came
[41:15] to God, he said, "Good master, what must
[41:18] I do to be saved?" And he said, "Keep
[41:20] the commandments." He said, "I've done
[41:22] all the deeds from my youth." Amen. And
[41:25] the Lord said, "But you have one thing
[41:26] left yet to be done. Sell all that you
[41:29] have. Give to the poor. Come and follow
[41:32] me and you have eternal life." But the
[41:34] Bible say he went away sad. Amen.
[41:36] Because he had much riches. Amen.
[41:38] Hallelujah. Amen. And Jesus said, "How
[41:40] hard it would be for a rich person to
[41:42] enter into the kingdom of heaven." Amen.
[41:45] Amen. It's easier for them to go through
[41:47] the eye of a needle than for a rich man
[41:49] to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[41:50] Amen. Hallelujah. But we see that as we
[41:53] read this on down through the
[41:54] scriptures, Amen. that this rich man,
[41:57] Amen, we follow him through the
[41:58] scripture. He one time he came to the
[42:00] point that he had a lot of goods and he
[42:03] went and he wanted to tear down his
[42:04] bones and build bigger bonds. Amen.
[42:07] Amen. And he built bigger bonds. And he
[42:09] said, "Oh my the old soul,
[42:12] lay back and take your ease now cuz you
[42:14] got much good." But this the voice came
[42:18] that night said, "Oh thy fool, tonight
[42:22] thy soul is required of thee." Amen.
[42:24] Hallelujah. Amen. Even though he had
[42:26] laid up all these treasures, Amen. God
[42:29] required his soul at night. Amen. And
[42:31] the Bible say when that young when that
[42:34] young rich ruler the man at that time
[42:36] when he woke up he woke up in hell.
[42:39] Amen. Hallelujah.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine him being a rich
[42:43] man? Amen. He had when they had his
[42:46] funeral. Amen. They had him laid out in
[42:48] the best coffin. Amen. He he probably
[42:52] dressed in the best clothes that he
[42:53] could have. Amen. Is that right? Amen.
[42:55] The altar will probably array with all
[42:58] kind of flowers. Is that right? Amen.
[43:00] People were singing the best song. He
[43:02] got up to give good testimony about this
[43:04] young rich brother Bruter. Amen. But
[43:06] while all of that was going on, all the
[43:09] accolades were being made. Amen. People
[43:11] were praising his name, that man's soul
[43:13] was in hell.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Even though he said ash to ash, dust to
[43:17] dust, that only pertained to his body
[43:20] and not to his soul. Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that?
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. In Jesus Christ's
[43:26] name. See, man became a living soul. So
[43:29] when we they when we die, we going
[43:31] somewhere.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Either going to heaven or you going to
[43:35] hell.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Straight forward. Is that right?
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So while we got a chance now, why
[43:41] God, we still got breath in our body. Is
[43:44] that right? Amen. We should give
[43:46] everything that we got to serve God.
[43:48] Amen. Amen. Amen. Forsake everything
[43:50] him. Amen. Amen. Cuz one day we going to
[43:53] leave this place. Amen. None of us has
[43:55] come here to stay. Amen. Is that right?
[43:57] Amen. Amen. We may stay here 100 years.
[43:59] Amen. But sooner or later you gone.
[44:01] Amen. But the thing when you leave the
[44:04] condition of your body is the most
[44:05] important part. Amen.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all believe that?
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. So while
[44:12] we got a chance, excuse me.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Let us take give our lives to the Lord
[44:18] and worship him. Amen. Forsaken
[44:20] everything but him. Amen. Nothing is
[44:23] more important than eternal life. Is
[44:25] that right? Nothing more important than
[44:26] to beat God's face in peace. Amen. Cuz
[44:28] God said every every knee is going to
[44:30] bow and every tongue shall confess that
[44:32] he is Lord to the glory of God the
[44:34] father. Amen. Amen. So it's best to bow
[44:36] down and worship God now. Hallelujah.
[44:38] While you can meet his face in peace cuz
[44:40] one day you going to meet going to bow
[44:42] down and say it. Amen. And acknowledge
[44:44] that he is God. Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So while we can meet his face in
[44:47] peace, do all that you can now
[44:50] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz we going to leave here one
[44:53] day. Is that right? By and by one of
[44:56] these mornings, we won't be here. Amen.
[44:58] In the name of Jesus Christ. I love you.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Also, we see in Genesis
[45:02] 2:18, God said it's not good that man
[45:05] should be alone. Amen. And why did he
[45:08] said that? Because God knew what it was
[45:10] like to be lonely. Amen. Cuz he was once
[45:13] Elohim, the self-existent one out there
[45:16] all by himself. Amen. He got lonely. Is
[45:19] that right? God lonely. So he began to
[45:22] create. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So after
[45:25] he then cuz before
[45:28] his creation he wasn't even God. He was
[45:31] just Elohim the selfexistent one because
[45:35] God means an object of worship at that
[45:38] time there was nothing or nobody to
[45:41] worship him. Amen. But after he began to
[45:44] create then he became God. Amen. Is that
[45:47] right? Amen. So everything when God did
[45:49] the creation everything in the in the
[45:51] creation had a made except Adam. Amen.
[45:55] And that's why he said it's not good
[45:57] that man should be alone. Is that right?
[45:59] Amen. Amen. So God created Eve for him.
[46:02] Amen. Not only that, he brought after
[46:04] God created all the animals and
[46:06] everything, he brought them all to Adam
[46:08] to name. Adam named him the cow, dog,
[46:12] elephant. Is that right? And God said,
[46:15] "That's exactly what I would name."
[46:17] Amen. Cuz he Adam was a God image of God
[46:20] made in God's own image. Amen. In other
[46:23] words, God Adam was a minor God here on
[46:25] earth. Is that right? Amen. In Jesus
[46:27] Christ's name. And see God formed Eve
[46:29] from Adam and God brought Eve even to
[46:32] Adam to name and he Adam called her name
[46:35] woman because she came out of me. Amen.
[46:39] Hallelujah. Then we see that God told
[46:42] him as he formed Adam and Eve. He said
[46:46] you can eat of all the trees of the
[46:48] garden except the tree of the knowledge
[46:51] of good and evil. Is that right?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he said the day that you eat
[46:55] of it, you shall die. Amen. Amen.
[46:58] Hallelujah. And they did that. Amen.
[47:01] Amen. They ate of that tree of knowledge
[47:03] of good and evil. But we know that Adam
[47:05] was not deceived.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Eve being in was deceived being into
[47:09] transgression. Amen. Is that right? But
[47:12] Adam Amen. knowing that he didn't want
[47:14] to lose his wife. Is that right? Adam
[47:17] parttook of that sin. Amen. To save Eve.
[47:20] Amen. Is that right? Just as the Lord
[47:22] Jesus Christ, he who knew no sin became
[47:25] sin. Amen. That we might become the
[47:27] righteousness of God in him. Amen. Is
[47:29] that God didn't know no sin, but he took
[47:31] our sin on him. Amen. Is that right?
[47:33] When he was hanging on that cross, we
[47:34] should have been there. Amen. Amen. But
[47:36] God took our sin upon him. Amen. God, he
[47:39] knew no sin, but he became sin. Amen.
[47:42] Amen. He became a liar,
[47:45] a dope patter. Whatever sin that there
[47:47] was out there. Amen. He became that on
[47:49] the cross. Amen. Cuz he took cuz if if
[47:52] he didn't, we as his bride would have
[47:56] been lost. Amen. Amen. But he became sin
[47:59] that we might might become the
[48:01] righteousness of God in him. Amen. Do
[48:03] you thank God for that? Amen. Amen. Cuz
[48:05] the Bible say if God will mark our
[48:07] iniquities, which one of us could stand?
[48:09] Amen. None of us could. Is that right?
[48:11] Amen. in Jesus Christ's name.
[48:13] Hallelujah. And so man, they ate from
[48:15] that tree of the knowledge of good and
[48:17] evil. Amen. Amen. And they and death
[48:19] sent in. Amen. Cuz true death means to
[48:22] be separated from God. Amen. They died a
[48:25] natural death later on. Amen. Amen. But
[48:27] they wasn't lost. Adam and Eve wasn't
[48:30] lost because God killed an innocent
[48:32] substitute for them. God killed a
[48:35] innocent lamb for them. Amen. Amen. This
[48:37] innocent of lamb will point toward the
[48:39] true lamb of God who was cometh which
[48:41] was Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah.
[48:44] Amen. Is that right? Amen. Cuz John the
[48:45] Baptist, he said, "Behold the lamb of
[48:47] God." Amen. Which take away the sins of
[48:49] the world. Amen. Amen. He was standing
[48:51] in the midst of the people and the
[48:52] people didn't know who he was. Amen.
[48:54] Hallelujah. He's still standing in the
[48:56] midst of people right now. People still
[48:58] don't know who he is. Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Is that right? We know
[49:02] that God is a living word. Amen. Thank
[49:04] you, Jesus. In the beginning was the
[49:06] word. The word was with God and the word
[49:08] was God and the word was made flesh and
[49:10] dwelt among us because Amen. And right

[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said man should not live by
[49:23] bread alone but by every word that
[49:25] proceedth out of the mouth of God. Amen.
[49:28] Amen. And if you are what you eat. Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; If you eat the word of God, you become
[49:34] the word of God. Cuz one thing about the
[49:36] word of God, is that right? The word of
[49:38] God is a seed. And a seed got within
[49:41] itself transforming power. Amen. Amen.
[49:44] If you take the word of God, place it in
[49:46] an under heart. Amen. Amen. That word is
[49:48] going to change you into it. Amen.

[50:32] Christ. Amen. But through all of that
[50:34] fall, through all of that rotten,
[50:36] through all of that stink, out came the
[50:38] life of Christ once we received the word
[50:41] of God. Is that right? Amen. Because we
[50:43] planted the word in our heart like David

[51:20] Therefore, when when it's needed, the
[51:22] Bible say that Lord when the enemy comes
[51:24] in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord
[51:26] will lift up a standard against you.
[51:28] Amen. Amen. Because that that word

[51:51] forfeited the title deed to the earth.
[51:54] the title deed to learn to eternal life
[51:57] to all the powers and promises of God.
[52:00] He forfeited that when he failed. Amen.
[52:02] Amen. And when Adam gave up the title
[52:04] deed for wisdom instead of faith, Satan
[52:07] couldn't take that that deed. Now, is
[52:09] that right? Satan is the god of this
[52:12] world. 2 Corinthians 4:4, he said,
[52:14] "Amen. If I was gossip, be hid to those
[52:17] that are lost. to whom the god of this
[52:19] world has blinded the minds of those
[52:21] that believe not. Lest the light of the
[52:22] glorious gospel shall shine unto them.
[52:25] Amen. Amen. God is Satan is a god of
[52:28] this world, but Satan don't own this
[52:30] world. Amen. Is that right? Amen. We

[52:40] people everywhere you go. Amen. Amen.

[52:48] almighty to original owner. The almighty
[52:51] God, the El Shadai. Amen. The breasted
[52:55] God. Amen. Is that right? The almighty
[52:58] God. The breasted God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:00] I'm reminded God told a uh uh Moses, you
[53:05] know, after he went and spoke to Pharaoh
[53:07] and Pharaoh got upset, you know, and
[53:10] told him to take away the straw and but
[53:12] they still got to make the same tail of
[53:14] bricks. Amen. And the people got began
[53:16] to mumble and complain. Amen. So God
[53:18] told Moses, "Amen." Hallelujah. He said,
[53:21] "I appeared unto Abraham, Isaac, and
[53:24] Jacob by the name of God Almighty, but
[53:28] by my name Jehovah was I not known."
[53:31] Hallelujah. Amen. He said, "By my name
[53:34] Jehovah, I was not known." Amen. Because
[53:37] Jehovah means one with his family.
[53:40] Hallelujah. Amen. Adam and Eve knew him
[53:43] as Jehovah. Amen. Because the Bible said
[53:45] it God would come down and fellowship
[53:48] with Adam and Eve in the cool of the
[53:50] day. Amen. Is that right? They knew him
[53:53] as Jehovah. But once sin came in. Amen.
[53:56] They lost that name. Amen. They So God
[53:58] had to restore that name to him. Amen.
[54:00] He said, "I as I said earlier, I
[54:03] appeared under Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
[54:05] by the name of uh all God Almighty, the
[54:08] blessed one, El Shadai." Amen. Amen. If
[54:11] you get weak,
[54:13] suck on the breast of Elad.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; The Old and the New Testament.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right? If you get lonely, suck
[54:21] on the the breast of El Shadai. Amen.
[54:24] Amen. If you get short of money, suck on
[54:26] the breast of El Shadai. Amen. I

[54:33] say that, I'm going to visit you
[54:34] according to the time of life, and you
[54:35] shall have that son. Amen. Abraham
[54:37] needed some strength to bring forth.

[54:50] Amen. Amen. He was able to still bring
[54:53] it to him. Amen. And even while he was
[54:55] waiting, the Bible say Abra he did not
[54:58] stagger. Amen. Is that right? At the
[55:00] promise of God through unbelief. Is that
[55:02] right? Amen. Amen. And God have made us
[55:04] exceeding g has given us exceeding great
[55:07] and great and exceeding promises.
[55:10] Everybody
[55:11] &gt;&gt; precious promises.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; And a promise I think about a promise we
[55:15] sometime we have to wait on them.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; But wait on them.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; If God said it, it's amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz all the promises of God like yeah
[55:24] and what? Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; But sometime we got to wait on them.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right? God told Abraham and
[55:30] Sarah that she was going to have a
[55:31] child. But Sarah got a little fast. She
[55:34] tried to produce the promise. Is that
[55:37] right? Amen. You can't produce the
[55:38] promise of God. You got to wait on it.
[55:40] Amen. Amen. She told Abraham to go into
[55:43] Hagar. Amen. Amen. And have that child
[55:45] and let him lay across my need and I'll
[55:47] claim him as mine. But that wasn't God's
[55:49] approp.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; That wasn't God appropriate way. Is that
[55:52] right? God told him that Sarah was going
[55:55] to have that child. Amen. Because
[55:56] through through all through Isaac, Amen.
[55:59] was all the world's going to be blessed.
[56:01] Amen. Is that right?
[56:02] &gt;&gt; But he wasn't actually talking about
[56:04] Isaac, but he was talking about the
[56:05] royal seed, which was the Lord Jesus
[56:07] Christ. All nations was going to be
[56:09] blessed. Amen. Y'all love him?
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We said the title deed
[56:14] went back to the original owner. Amen.
[56:16] And it was the abstract title deed to
[56:18] eternal life. And the word abstract
[56:20] means that it was searched all the way
[56:22] back to the beginning. Amen. You know,
[56:25] when you get ready to buy a house or
[56:27] something, you have to do a title
[56:28] search. Amen. to make sure that there's
[56:30] not any leans or any judgments against
[56:32] it. Amen. Amen. So they churched this
[56:35] abstract title deed was searched all the
[56:36] way back to the beginning and there was
[56:39] no claim on it. Is that right?
[56:40] Hallelujah. Amen. And that abstract deed
[56:43] went to back to God and he was sitting
[56:44] on the throne with it in his hand. Amen.
[56:47] In the name of Jesus Christ, the deed to
[56:50] eternal life. Amen. Hallelujah. Y'all
[56:52] love him?
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; The deed to the earth. Amen. Is that
[56:55] right? Y'all know this is where we going
[56:56] to live at.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? The Bible say the
[57:00] meek shall inherit the earth.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Note
[57:05] the legal possession that that abstract
[57:07] title deed to eternal life means notice
[57:10] to you and me that we possesses
[57:14] everything that Adam and Eve had.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Everything. We got to believe that
[57:21] &gt;&gt; that we possess. We've been restored
[57:23] back to that. Is that right? To
[57:25] everything that Adam and Eve had. Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got to believe that we
[57:30] are more than just church people.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right? We are more more than
[57:34] just just coming to church woman of pew.
[57:36] Amen. Amen. We we we're here to finish
[57:39] that redemptive work of Christ. Amen. Is
[57:41] that right? Amen. Amen. That's our job.
[57:43] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. We're more
[57:45] than just bench warmers, church goers.
[57:48] Amen. We are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[57:51] And we're here to finish that redemptive
[57:52] work of Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. We got
[57:55] to believe it. Amen. that we have now
[57:57] become the living word of God. Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; We've become that. Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. People a lot of time they said,
[58:04] "Lord, I want to see you." And God send
[58:07] one of us.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; And as it was when Jesus was here, he
[58:12] was an unrecognized God. And right now
[58:14] we are even God is being unrecognized.
[58:17] Why? Because he's in a body of flesh
[58:19] again. Amen. All that God was, he pulled
[58:21] it into Jesus Christ. All that Jesus
[58:23] Christ was, he has poured it into his
[58:25] church. Hallelujah.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all believe that?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why we
[58:33] we're more than conquerors.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. He's already
[58:36] conquerable, but we are more than
[58:37] conquerors. Amen. Because we're
[58:39] receiving the benefits of what he paid
[58:41] bought for us. Amen. Hallelujah. In
[58:43] Jesus Christ, all we got to do is write
[58:44] the check.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; But the problem is a lot of time we
[58:48] scared to write the check. Is that
[58:50] right? Amen. Amen. But see, we don't
[58:52] want to limit the unlimited God. Amen.
[58:54] The Bible say God God can do
[58:56] exceedingly, abundantly, more than we
[58:58] can even ask or think. Amen. All we got
[59:01] to do is ask in in faith. Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name and claim it.
[59:05] Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. Y'all love
[59:07] it.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Jesus Christ's name. And see,
[59:11] like I said, that legal possession of
[59:12] the abstract title to eternal life mean
[59:14] that you have everything
[59:17] that Adam and Eve's law. Believest this.
[59:20] Amen. But the requirement for
[59:22] redemption, no man, not even Adam,
[59:26] he needed redemption himself, was able
[59:28] to fulfill that. Is that right? Amen.
[59:31] God's law required a kinsman redeemer.
[59:34] Hallelujah. And the grace of God
[59:36] fulfilled that kinsman redeemer uh law
[59:39] in what? In the person of Jesus Christ.
[59:42] Amen. Hallelujah. He had to had to be
[59:45] human and born and virgin born. Is that
[59:48] right? The virgin birth produced that
[59:50] product cuz he had to be human. Is that
[59:53] right? Amen. Jesus, he was immaculately
[59:56] born as we all know. Amen. Amen. He was
[59:59] born without that sexual act. Amen.
[1:00:02] Amen. He was born virgin birth. He came
[1:00:05] to to a virgin which was Mary.
[1:00:07] Hallelujah.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why his sin was sinless.
[1:00:11] Amen. Because we know what the original
[1:00:13] sin was. Amen. Amen. that were original
[1:00:16] sin, you know, was a sexual desire
[1:00:19] through Adam and Eve. Amen. Amen. And
[1:00:21] that that created a sin nature in all of
[1:00:23] us. Amen. But Jesus, he had to come and
[1:00:25] bypass that sin nature. Amen. That's why
[1:00:27] he was born virgin birth. Amen. God
[1:00:30] created the egg and the sperm and put it
[1:00:31] inside of Mary. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:34] And Mary didn't have nothing to do
[1:00:35] except incubate that word. Amen. That
[1:00:37] God had put inside of her. Amen. That's
[1:00:39] why when he was on the cross and they
[1:00:41] said, "Your mothers look for," he said,
[1:00:42] "Who is my mother and who is my
[1:00:44] brother?" Except he who keeps my word.
[1:00:46] Hallelujah. Amen. God never did
[1:00:49] acknowledge her as being his mother. Is
[1:00:50] that right? Amen. Cuz he knew that she
[1:00:52] was on a bar remove. Amen. Even Mary
[1:00:54] denied the virgin birth at one time.
[1:00:56] Hallelujah. Amen. They had gone down to
[1:01:00] Jerusalem, had left out of Jerusalem for
[1:01:01] about 3 days journey and they realized
[1:01:03] that Jesus wasn't with them.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They realized that they had
[1:01:08] left the word. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:01:10] Sometime we can get going. We have to
[1:01:12] and we may sometime leave the word.
[1:01:14] Amen. But one thing about leaving the
[1:01:16] word, wherever you left it, that's where
[1:01:18] you'll find it. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:21] They went back into Jerusalem. Amen. And
[1:01:23] Jes and uh Mary went to look at Jesus
[1:01:26] said, "Don't you know that me and my
[1:01:28] father been looking for you?" Amen.
[1:01:30] Denying the virgin birth. Amen.
[1:01:31] Hallelujah. But Jesus, you see, one
[1:01:34] thing about the word, the word will
[1:01:36] correct that error.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right? The word will correct the
[1:01:41] error. Jesus looked at her and said,
[1:01:43] "Don't you know I must be about my
[1:01:45] father's business." Amen. And God's
[1:01:47] Jesus's father's business was not
[1:01:49] building canvas. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:52] It was preaching the gospel. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:54] That's why we got to be about our
[1:01:56] father's building. Amen. Especially in
[1:01:57] this hour that we're living in. Amen.
[1:01:59] When we see that all foundations are out
[1:02:01] of course. Amen. Is that right?
[1:02:03] Everything that we put in in trust in is
[1:02:06] on shaky grounds right now. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:09] You can't believe the police force.
[1:02:11] Amen. You can't believe teachers in
[1:02:13] school. Amen. Amen. You can't even tr
[1:02:15] put trust in your doctors. Is it right?
[1:02:17] Amen. And definitely not your
[1:02:18] politicians. Ain't right. Amen. The only
[1:02:20] true place you can put trust in is in
[1:02:22] Jesus Christ and he heal the living
[1:02:25] word. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the living word. Amen. Put
[1:02:30] your trust in Christ. Amen. Trust in the
[1:02:32] Lord with all thine heart. Lean not to
[1:02:34] thine own understanding, but in all your
[1:02:37] ways acknowledge him. And his promise is
[1:02:39] that he will direct your path.
[1:02:41] Hallelujah.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all believe it.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Jesus Christ's name.
[1:02:46] Hallelujah. Amen. See
[1:02:51] as a John. Amen. He saw that in the
[1:02:54] right hand of him that sit on the
[1:02:56] throne. As I said earlier, that that
[1:02:58] that the cry went out for the kisman
[1:03:00] redeemer. And God fulfilled that kinsman
[1:03:03] redeemer requirement in the person of
[1:03:04] Jesus Christ. He had to become become
[1:03:06] human and the virgin birth produced that
[1:03:09] person. Jesus came in the likeness of
[1:03:12] sinful flesh. As I said, amen. He was in
[1:03:14] he was just like we are. Jesus got
[1:03:17] hungry. Jesus got sleepy. Jesus got
[1:03:20] tired. Is that right?
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; But he he didn't his flesh was not
[1:03:24] sinful. The Bible say he was in all
[1:03:27] points tempted yet without sin. Because
[1:03:29] if he had one sin against him, he could
[1:03:32] not have gone to the cross. Amen. It had
[1:03:34] to be a sinless sacrifice. Is that
[1:03:36] right? Amen. Hallelujah. So he was he
[1:03:38] was tempted now. Amen. Y'all better
[1:03:41] believe it. Women approached Jesus.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. Jesus was offer
[1:03:46] offer some of alcohol to drink. Amen.
[1:03:49] They he was probably offered some drinks
[1:03:50] or something. Is that right? All of that
[1:03:52] is sin. He was tempted in that but he
[1:03:55] did not accept it. Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all understand?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I say he was in all
[1:03:59] points tempted but yet without seeing in
[1:04:02] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. So the cry
[1:04:05] went out for the kinsman redeemer.
[1:04:06] Revelation the fifth chapter said who is
[1:04:09] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:04:11] seals the hell? Amen. But there was no
[1:04:14] man worthy. Amen. Amen. He looked up in
[1:04:17] heaven. John looked up in heaven. Amen.
[1:04:19] The 24 elders wasn't worship. That Moses
[1:04:22] wasn't worthy. Adam wasn't worthy. David
[1:04:26] wasn't worthy. Amen. He looked even into
[1:04:29] the earth. Martin Luther King wasn't
[1:04:31] worthy.
[1:04:32] Billy Graham wasn't worthy. Ro, even
[1:04:36] William Brandon wasn't worthy. Amen. Is
[1:04:38] that right? Amen. He even looked under
[1:04:40] the earth. The young rich ruler wasn't
[1:04:42] worthy. Dayan wasn't worthy. Dayan and
[1:04:44] Kora. Amen. Balam, none of them was
[1:04:46] worthy. The Bible said John began to
[1:04:48] weep.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because he knew if nobody
[1:04:52] worthy was found that all was lost. Is
[1:04:55] that right? Amen. But one of the elders
[1:04:57] said, "Weep not John. Behold, the lion
[1:05:00] of the tribe of Judah has prevailed." Is
[1:05:02] that right? To open the book and to
[1:05:04] loose the seals thereof. Amen. But John
[1:05:07] said he turned and he looked. Amen. But
[1:05:09] he saw a line a lamb as it has been
[1:05:12] stain slain. Is that right? And that
[1:05:14] lamb, he wasn't sitting down. He was
[1:05:16] standing. Hallelujah. Amen. Cuz he
[1:05:19] didn't traded a wine press of the wrath
[1:05:20] of God all by himself. Amen. And he saw
[1:05:23] a bloody lamb. Amen. That's why the
[1:05:25] Bible tell us once you've done all that
[1:05:28] you can do
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; stand. Amen. Had your loans gird about
[1:05:33] with truth. Hallelujah. Is that right?
[1:05:35] Amen. Hallelujah. As you've done all you
[1:05:37] can do. Don't don't give up. Amen.
[1:05:39] Stand. Amen. God said. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:05:43] Bring back the scripture to him. Is that
[1:05:44] right? God, you said. Hallelujah. I pay
[1:05:47] my tithes and offering. You'll pour out
[1:05:49] a blessing enough to me that I cannot
[1:05:51] behold. Amen. Lord, you said by your
[1:05:54] stripes I'm already healed. Is that
[1:05:55] right? Amen. Hallelujah. God, you say
[1:05:58] you're my Jehovah Gyra. Hallelujah.
[1:06:00] Amen. Hallelujah. You said bring it back
[1:06:02] to him. Bring break his word to him.
[1:06:04] God, you said it.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And I'm standing on your promises. Amen.
[1:06:09] I'll do all hell a sail against me.
[1:06:11] Amen. I'm standing on your word. Amen.
[1:06:14] I'm like Job. Amen. Hallelujah. Go God
[1:06:16] gave a good testimony of Job. Amen. He
[1:06:19] told Satan about Job. Amen. He said,
[1:06:21] "Though you move against Job, you've
[1:06:24] taken all that he got. You even got
[1:06:27] careless children." Amen. But one thing
[1:06:29] about him, though you move against him,
[1:06:31] he still holds fast his integrity.
[1:06:34] Hallelujah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Amen. Though the
[1:06:37] Satan come against us, Amen. Hold on to
[1:06:39] your integrity. Still be honest, still
[1:06:42] be pure. Amen. Is that right? Amen.
[1:06:45] Regardless of what going against you,
[1:06:47] Amen. Amen. Don't falter. Amen. Hold
[1:06:50] fast your integrity just like Job. Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; So God can give a testimony to him.
[1:06:55] Amen. Why they say God allowed Satan to
[1:06:57] come against Job? Cuz God knew the
[1:06:59] testimony that Job had in his heart.
[1:07:02] Amen. He knew the testimony of Job. That
[1:07:04] why he said, "Have you considered my
[1:07:06] servant Job?
[1:07:08] Have you considered my servant Earnest
[1:07:11] of my servant brother Fred? Have you
[1:07:13] considered them?" Is that right? Amen.
[1:07:15] God God knew what was in him. Is that
[1:07:17] right? Amen. And so when the enemy come
[1:07:18] in like a flood, stand
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; like that lamb was standing. Is that
[1:07:23] right? Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. In
[1:07:26] Jesus Christ's name. And see the lamb,
[1:07:28] he came and he took the book out of out
[1:07:29] of the hand of him that set on the
[1:07:30] throne. Amen. It now belongs to the
[1:07:34] lamb. God's law required a kinsman
[1:07:37] redeemer. And the lamb cannot book.
[1:07:41] He said, "I'm the kinsman. I'm the
[1:07:44] redeemer. I made intercessions for them.
[1:07:47] Now I have come to claim the rights for
[1:07:50] them. Amen. They have a right to
[1:07:52] everything that was lost. Is that right?
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; We thank God. Amen. That he said in the
[1:07:58] Bible. I shall restore unto you all the
[1:08:01] yield that the canker worm, the pormer,
[1:08:04] the caterpillar, and the locust have
[1:08:06] taken away. Is that right? Amen. Well,
[1:08:08] God said my army that I s against. Amen.
[1:08:10] But God promised that he going to
[1:08:12] restore it. And he have in this hour
[1:08:14] restored it all back. Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. If y'all can believe it. Amen.
[1:08:18] Amen. God has restored back to us what
[1:08:20] Adam and Eve had. Amen.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; I believe it. I'm crazy enough to
[1:08:25] believe it.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? And I and I live
[1:08:30] live according to that. Is that right?
[1:08:32] Amen. Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah.
[1:08:35] Amen. And see after the lamb took that
[1:08:37] book. Amen. Worship broke out into
[1:08:40] heaven. Is that right? Amen. Worship
[1:08:43] broke out in heaven cuz God had take the
[1:08:46] lamb had taken that book and opened the
[1:08:48] seals and loo and worship. The elders
[1:08:50] fell down there 24 elders and all of
[1:08:52] them began to worship and the Bible said
[1:08:54] they sang a new song.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That song be sang that thou
[1:08:59] art worthy to take the book and to open
[1:09:05] the seals thereof.
[1:09:07] For thou was slain and has redeemed
[1:09:11] us to God by thy blood out of every
[1:09:17] kingdom and tongue and people
[1:09:21] and nation
[1:09:23] and has made us unto our God kings and
[1:09:28] priests and we shall reign on the earth.
[1:09:33] Amen. Worship broke out. Hallelujah.
[1:09:36] Amen. Wow. Because God had done
[1:09:37] something. Amen. Look back through the
[1:09:39] scriptures. Every time God does some
[1:09:40] miracle, a news they bring out with a
[1:09:42] new song. Hallelujah. Amen. I remember
[1:09:44] when they walked through the God open up
[1:09:46] the Red Sea. Amen. They walked across on
[1:09:48] dry land. Amen. Amen. After they after
[1:09:51] his children got on the other side and
[1:09:52] Pharaoh tried to follow and God let the
[1:09:55] sea come back over and kill them. Amen.
[1:09:57] But the Bible said on that other side of
[1:09:58] that river, Miriam got that tamarine and
[1:10:01] they began to praise and worship God. Is
[1:10:03] that right? Amen. Amen. That's how we
[1:10:06] should be. Amen. When God bring us
[1:10:08] deliverance to us, Amen. we shall break

[1:20:40] reminded when Job Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] Every morning he offer offered a
[1:20:43] sacrifice for his children just in the
[1:20:45] event that he may have sinned against
[1:20:47] God. Amen. any God servant in this house
[1:20:49] that when that house fell on them and
[1:20:51] killed them all. Hallelujah. Not one of

[1:20:56] was there as a memorial for them. Amen.

[1:21:11] gave him 2,000. Amen. Had a 100 sheep,
[1:21:14] he gave him 200 sheep. Is that right?
[1:21:16] But when it came down to the children,
[1:21:18] he only gave them seven. Amen.
[1:21:23] Why he didn't double the children?
[1:21:24] Because he already had seven on the
[1:21:26] other side already saved. So when the
[1:21:28] seven on the earth to get over there
[1:21:30] with the seven in heaven. Amen. That was
[1:21:32] double. Hallelujah. Amen. In Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ's name. Hallelujah. We possess
[1:21:37] the title of deed that have lost and all
[1:21:39] the benefits of it. Why? Because the
[1:21:41] Bible said the meek shall inherit the
[1:21:43] earth. Amen.
[1:21:45] Luke 17:30, God promised that the Son of
[1:21:48] Man would be revealed when the days get
[1:21:50] like they were in Sodom. And I must say
[1:21:53] that we're living in the days of Sodom
[1:21:57] right now.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Perversion is everywhere.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; All over the world,

[1:22:08] We're in that sodomite condition yet
[1:22:10] once again. Amen. But to to us, Amen.
[1:22:14] It's not a bad time for us because we

[1:22:20] revealing himself. Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Y'all believe that? Amen.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We know that that that
[1:22:28] uh in the God comes in three sons names.
[1:22:30] Amen. God came in the son of man with a
[1:22:33] prophet. Is that right? He come in the
[1:22:35] son uh son of God. Amen. Which is the
[1:22:37] Holy Ghost. Amen. He didn't come as the
[1:22:40] son of David in the millennium. Amen.
[1:22:43] Amen. But we know that in the midst of
[1:22:45] uh in between the the ministry of the
[1:22:47] son of God and the son of David that God
[1:22:50] was going to be revealed once again as a
[1:22:52] son of man. Is that right prophet to
[1:22:55] reveal what? The son of man. Amen. And
[1:22:58] he has done that. Is that right? Amen.
[1:23:00] He has come. Amen. I remind him when he
[1:23:02] was baptizing I think on it may have
[1:23:04] been on Ohio River. What? What river he
[1:23:06] was baptizing on. Amen. And that light
[1:23:08] came and it shone over him and out of
[1:23:11] that light the voice spoke. He said as
[1:23:14] John the Baptist for my first coming. Is
[1:23:18] that right? He said your message shall
[1:23:21] forrun my second coming. Amen. So this
[1:23:24] very message that we got is that right?
[1:23:27] We we're privileged to have Amen. is
[1:23:30] actually a message that's forrunning the
[1:23:32] coming of Christ. That's how important
[1:23:35] it is. Is that right?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can believe that. Amen.
[1:23:39] Amen. It's for running Christ. Christ is
[1:23:41] on is this coming this message has been
[1:23:44] given to us. Amen. What? To turn our
[1:23:46] hearts back to the faith that the
[1:23:48] Pentecostal fathers had. Amen. Is that
[1:23:51] right? Amen. Because right now we're
[1:23:52] enjoying this message right now. But one
[1:23:55] day, Amen. As God cut the Jews off, he
[1:23:57] going to cut us off. Is that right?
[1:23:59] Amen. Because the same message that
[1:24:01] we're enjoying got to go back to the
[1:24:02] Jews. Go to the Jews. God promised the
[1:24:05] Jews, Amen, one week of preaching. Amen.
[1:24:07] We know that one week in the Bible
[1:24:08] represent seven years. Jesus preached
[1:24:10] only three and a half years and he was
[1:24:12] cut off at the cross. Amen. Is that
[1:24:14] right? And after that Jews would were
[1:24:16] not accepted. God ushered us Gentiles
[1:24:18] in. Amen. We know that God blinded the
[1:24:20] Jews that they might not receive him. Is
[1:24:24] that right? Why? Because that gave us an
[1:24:26] opportunity for us Gentile dogs to come
[1:24:29] into the
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right? The kingdom. Amen. But as
[1:24:34] as God cut the Jews off and ushered us
[1:24:36] in, God is going to cut us off. Is that
[1:24:39] right? The days of the Gentiles
[1:24:40] dispensation is closing. Amen. Amen. And
[1:24:43] once that this days of the Gentile
[1:24:45] dispensation closes, then this this uh
[1:24:49] uh revelation of Jesus Christ that we're
[1:24:51] enjoying, I hope you're enjoying it.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Is going to come go over to the Jews to
[1:24:58] pull out the elected 144,000.
[1:25:01] Amen. Amen. Because they don't know
[1:25:04] Jesus Christ as the Messiah not yet.
[1:25:06] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So
[1:25:09] God owed he preached to them for three
[1:25:11] and a half years. He owed them another
[1:25:13] three and a half years of preaching.
[1:25:15] Amen. Amen. Like I said earlier that all
[1:25:17] the promises of God are what? Yay and
[1:25:20] amen. Amen. Hallelujah. But I said in
[1:25:23] between the ministry, the son of God
[1:25:24] ministry and the and the son of David
[1:25:26] ministry, God will be revealed again as
[1:25:28] a son of man. Is that right? And God
[1:25:31] will be in human flesh again. Y'all
[1:25:33] believe that?

[1:25:56] same same thing. Amen. Is that right?
[1:25:58] Amen. And he and he had reached the
[1:26:00] pinnacle of his ministry. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:02] And he said he had to pull back. Amen.
[1:26:04] Hallelujah. Amen. And Jesus said, you
[1:26:06] know that brother, he was out a way
[1:26:08] chief over. Is that right? Amen. In
[1:26:10] Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:26:12] But we now when he left off the scene,
[1:26:14] he said now the move is on the bride. Is
[1:26:17] that right? The very thing that he did,
[1:26:19] Amen. we should be doing and will be
[1:26:21] doing. Amen. If you can believe that.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. God has

[1:26:40] that's the way it'll be done." Whatever
[1:26:42] you say. Amen. He said, "If you pray and
[1:26:45] doubt not, you'll have what you ask
[1:26:46] for." Y'all believe that? Amen.
[1:26:48] Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:50] Hallelujah. You pray and doubt not,
[1:26:52] you'll have what you ask for. I reminded
[1:26:54] when Paul and Paul Paul and Silas I
[1:26:56] believe was in the jail in the book of
[1:26:57] Acts. Amen. And they were locked up in
[1:26:59] the chains. Amen. But they were still
[1:27:01] worshiping God. Hallelujah. They
[1:27:03] worshiping God so so much. Amen. That
[1:27:05] all of a sudden the chains fell off of
[1:27:06] them. The jail those are the jail flew
[1:27:08] over. Amen. The jailer he ran back there
[1:27:11] scared. Amen. That they had escaped and
[1:27:13] he know that they had escaped that they
[1:27:15] were going to kill him. Amen. So he he
[1:27:16] was about to take his life. Paul said,
[1:27:18] "Oh, do yourself no harm. We all still
[1:27:21] yet here." Amen. Hallelujah. But they
[1:27:23] had worshiped God so much that that that
[1:27:25] jeal had fallen under conviction. Amen.
[1:27:27] Till he come running to him and said,
[1:27:29] "Men and brother, what must I do to be
[1:27:30] saved?" Hallelujah. Amen. Paul didn't
[1:27:33] tell him what not to do. But he said,
[1:27:35] "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. You
[1:27:37] and your household shall be saved."
[1:27:40] Amen. Hallelujah. Is that right?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Not that his not that his
[1:27:44] faith not that his salvation was going
[1:27:46] to save his house, but his faith for his
[1:27:49] family was going to save his house cuz
[1:27:51] he believed God what the word say if you
[1:27:54] believe and doubt not you should have
[1:27:56] what you ask for. Hallelujah. That's why
[1:27:58] claim your children. Amen. They may be
[1:28:01] cutting up. Claim them anyway. Claim
[1:28:03] your brothers and your sister, your
[1:28:04] loved ones. Amen. They may not be coming
[1:28:06] this way, but claim them for the kingdom
[1:28:08] of God. Hallelujah. Amen. If you and you
[1:28:11] hold that prayer, God is obligated to
[1:28:13] answer that prayer. Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz you praying dot dot, God ain't going
[1:28:17] to break his word. Amen. God ain't going

[1:28:33] himself and not for us. Amen. Amen. And
[1:28:35] none of his word shall ever fail. Amen.
[1:28:37] Amen. Heaven and earth will pass away,
[1:28:39] but not one jot, not till, not even the
[1:28:41] punctuation in the in the scriptures,
[1:28:44] the periods and the comma, none of that
[1:28:45] will pass away to all be fulfilled.
[1:28:48] Hallelujah. Amen. In Jesus Christ's
[1:28:50] name. So, we got a sure word of prophecy
[1:28:53] and we got to believe that. Amen. We got
[1:28:56] to honor that. Amen. And and and hold
[1:28:58] fast to it in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:29:00] because it's your message. Amen. Is that
[1:29:02] right? Amen. is is introducing is
[1:29:05] ushering in the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:07] Christ. Amen. This wrote, this message
[1:29:09] is going to get get us filled with the
[1:29:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost. This message
[1:29:13] of our Amen. is going to get us filled
[1:29:15] with faith. Is it right? Amen. Cuz this
[1:29:17] is a faith message. Amen. It's a Holy
[1:29:20] Ghost message. Amen. Amen. Cuz see,
[1:29:22] faith is a revelation. Amen. And the the
[1:29:25] the key to the rapture is faith.
[1:29:29] Is that right? The Bible say Enoch was
[1:29:32] translated. Is that right? Amen. Amen. H
[1:29:35] Enoch walked with God, but he was not.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God took him. But before
[1:29:41] his translation, he had this one
[1:29:43] testimony that he pleased God.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He pleased God. Jesus
[1:29:51] said, "Lord, I know you hear me because
[1:29:53] I always do the things that pleases
[1:29:55] you." Amen. Is that right? Amen. And we
[1:29:58] want to always do things that pleases
[1:30:00] God. Amen. So we can have that same
[1:30:03] testimony. Lord, I know you're here
[1:30:06] because I do everything to please you.
[1:30:09] Amen. Amen. And all you got to do is
[1:30:11] keep God's word. Amen. Amen. You keep
[1:30:13] God's word, you'll please him. Amen. Is
[1:30:15] that right? Hallelujah. In Jesus
[1:30:18] Christ's name. Hallelujah.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; As I say, the same ministry, the same
[1:30:23] thing, the spirit of the own brother, it
[1:30:26] didn't leave when he left. is now moved
[1:30:28] into the bride. We've now become the
[1:30:31] living word of God. Is that right? Amen.
[1:30:34] And see, because Jesus Christ is the
[1:30:36] same yesterday and today and forever.
[1:30:38] Amen. I reminded when Elijah crossed
[1:30:41] that Jordan River. Amen. He had told
[1:30:43] Elijah if he see him when he leave,
[1:30:45] he'll get what he asked for. So Elijah
[1:30:47] asked for a double portion of what he
[1:30:49] had. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah. So
[1:30:51] when Elijah walked down to that river,
[1:30:53] Amen. he took that mana and he smoked
[1:30:55] that water. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[1:30:57] that water party. Amen. And they walked
[1:30:59] across. Amen. Hallelujah. The Bible
[1:31:01] don't say that. But when they walked the
[1:31:03] cross, that water closed back up.
[1:31:06] The Bible don't say that, but it did.
[1:31:08] Why? Cuz when after after Elijah took
[1:31:10] off and that man fell down with the type
[1:31:12] of the Holy Ghost, is that right? Elijah
[1:31:14] picked up that manner and he spoke that
[1:31:16] water again.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where is the Lord God of Elijah?
[1:31:19] Amen. And once again, the water parted.
[1:31:21] Amen. Why? He had that same spirit that
[1:31:24] was on Elijah was in a double portion
[1:31:27] upon the Elishia. And the Elisha is a
[1:31:29] type of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:30] Hallelujah. Amen. Y'all believe he got a
[1:31:32] double portion on you now.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All we got to do is operate
[1:31:36] on it. Amen. Do what Jesus did. Amen. Is
[1:31:40] that right? Do as Jesus did. Amen.
[1:31:41] Hallelujah. Cuz Jesus said, "The works I
[1:31:43] do shall ye do even greater work than
[1:31:46] these cuz I go to the father." Is that
[1:31:48] right? Not that we can do anything
[1:31:50] greater than what Jesus did. Amen. But
[1:31:52] the greater work is that we once we can
[1:31:54] impart eternal life to somebody. Is that
[1:31:57] right? But it'll be more of us doing
[1:31:59] what Jesus did. Amen. Is that right?
[1:32:01] Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; The son of man is re being revealed in
[1:32:05] this hour of sodomite condition through
[1:32:09] his bride. Is that right? In the form of
[1:32:12] the Holy Ghost. Amen. In Jesus Christ's
[1:32:15] name. Y'all believe that? Amen. In Jesus
[1:32:17] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. As I as I
[1:32:21] draw down to close, I'm reminded
[1:32:26] about two years ago, we lo lost our son
[1:32:30] down in Florida. Amen. A guy killed him.
[1:32:32] Yeah, man. Stabbed him. Is that right?
[1:32:36] He stabbed him one time in the chest.
[1:32:38] That wasn't too bad. Is that right?
[1:32:40] Anytime you get stabbed is bad. Period.
[1:32:42] You know, excuse me.
[1:32:47] But when they stabbed him on this side,
[1:32:49] it cut a main artery that went to his
[1:32:52] brain
[1:32:55] and he was uh
[1:32:57] actually dead. Is that right? When they
[1:33:00] went in, they patched up that vein and
[1:33:02] they gave him eight pints of blood and
[1:33:05] and as he was coming out of the surgery,
[1:33:07] he had a major stroke and they had to
[1:33:09] rush him take him back to surgery. They
[1:33:12] put a a hose in his head to drain the
[1:33:16] fluid off of his brain. But actually a
[1:33:20] son, he was actually even though it had
[1:33:22] him on life support,
[1:33:24] he was dead for actually for 8 days. For
[1:33:28] 8 days he laid in that bed, no response,
[1:33:32] no kind of activity. Only thing that
[1:33:34] kept him going was that life support
[1:33:37] that was breathing breath into his body.
[1:33:40] Amen. So they called and told the wife,
[1:33:44] Amen, that they were going to have to
[1:33:45] take him off the life support. And she
[1:33:48] said, "If you can just leave him on
[1:33:49] there to Sunday, we'll be back down to
[1:33:51] Florida." And we had to be back down
[1:33:53] there at 10:00 that Sunday morning. And
[1:33:56] and we was there. And so we went in the
[1:33:59] room to see him. They asked us to leave
[1:34:01] out the room cuz they were going to take
[1:34:03] the life support off off of it.
[1:34:07] And because they said once they pull
[1:34:08] that tube out of it, a lot of time they
[1:34:10] throws up and they didn't want us to see
[1:34:12] that. But God was in control.
[1:34:16] Amen. They they like I said, he laid
[1:34:19] there. He was actually dead for 8 days.
[1:34:22] And he was only being kept going by that
[1:34:25] respirator.
[1:34:27] And once they took it out of him, is
[1:34:29] that right? Well, he didn't throw up.
[1:34:31] Amen. So they brought us back into the
[1:34:34] room. Amen. And he he had he was gone.
[1:34:38] He was dead.
[1:34:41] Hallelujah. God is good. But my prayer
[1:34:44] as we were standing here, I said, "Lord
[1:34:47] Jesus,
[1:34:49] in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:34:52] Lord, let him open his eyes."
[1:34:54] Hallelujah. Lord, I want to see his eyes
[1:34:58] open. Now, a man that's been dead for
[1:35:01] eight days,
[1:35:03] no activity in his body. Is that right?
[1:35:08] Amen. Amen. Just like God did to
[1:35:10] Lazarus. Amen. Lazarus dead in the
[1:35:13] grave. Amen. His spirit was gone. His
[1:35:16] soul was gone. God called that spirit
[1:35:19] back into Lazarus's body. Called his
[1:35:22] soul back into that Lazarus body.
[1:35:23] Lazarus got up out of the grave. God did
[1:35:26] the same thing for my son. even though
[1:35:29] he had been dead for eight days. Is that
[1:35:31] right? Through prayer to the Lord. Amen.
[1:35:34] A man that's been dead for eight days
[1:35:36] opened his eyes.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:41] In this day, he opened his eyes. He
[1:35:44] looked around. Then he closed his eyes.
[1:35:48] Then he opened his eyes again. And this
[1:35:50] time a little tear was coming down his
[1:35:52] eyes. Hallelujah. Amen. But then he
[1:35:56] closed his eyes and he was gone. Amen.
[1:36:00] Amen. Well, I just want to share to you
[1:36:01] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:36:05] today and forever. All we got to do is
[1:36:08] take him at his word. All we got to do
[1:36:11] is be willing enough to step out on his
[1:36:13] promises. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[1:36:16] that that's a testimony that I share.
[1:36:18] Amen. Until I leave here, God opened the
[1:36:21] eyes of a dead man for me. Hallelujah.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; The works that Jesus did, I was able to
[1:36:29] do through the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:31] Ghost. Amen. Because the word has been
[1:36:33] restored back in my life. And now I
[1:36:38] claim it. I am a walking living word in
[1:36:42] the flesh.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; And you are too. Amen. Amen. You just
[1:36:46] got to be willing to claim it. Amen. and
[1:36:48] operate in it and do the very works that
[1:36:51] Jesus did and you will receive the same
[1:36:55] results. Is that right? Get a lot of cap
[1:36:58] praise. Amen. In the name of Jesus
[1:37:01] Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. Though my son
[1:37:05] has gone on to the other world now.
[1:37:06] Amen. Amen. Even though he didn't like
[1:37:09] live a life worthy of the gospel, my
[1:37:12] prayer will save him cuz I prayed for
[1:37:16] him constantly like Job did his
[1:37:19] children. So I'm not I'm sad because I
[1:37:22] don't have the fellowship with him on
[1:37:23] this side, but I believe on the other
[1:37:25] side he's all right. He's all right.
[1:37:28] Amen. Cuz God is faithful to his
[1:37:30] promises. God is faithful to his word.
[1:37:34] Because the son of man is revealing
[1:37:36] himself through his bride in this
[1:37:39] sodomite condition hour that we're
[1:37:41] living in. Amen. Believest thou do
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us bow
[1:37:47] Jesus name. Lord in your allsufficient
[1:37:50] name.
[1:37:51] Hallelujah.
[1:37:53] First of all we thank you for being our
[1:37:55] God. We thank you for predestination.
[1:37:59] We thank you for bestowing upon us
[1:38:01] eternal life even before the foundation
[1:38:03] of the world.
[1:38:04] We thank you for sending the word back
[1:38:06] in this hour, Lord, to to open our eyes
[1:38:08] and take away our spiritual amnesia that
[1:38:11] we can see who that we are, that we are
[1:38:14] the child of the queen, that we are the
[1:38:17] bride of Jesus Christ, knowing that even
[1:38:20] as you put Adam to sleep, Lord, and took
[1:38:21] a bride out of his side when you died on
[1:38:25] the cross and they spirit you in the
[1:38:26] side, out came your bride in this hour.
[1:38:29] I came water and blood and now that
[1:38:32] water, blood, and spirit is searching
[1:38:33] the earth. Amen. Seeking for those,
[1:38:36] Amen. who was ordained to eternal life.

[1:42:23] now. Oh, God. as our brothers
[1:42:25] ministering, Lord. And I was talking
[1:42:28] about, oh God, just claiming, oh God, is
[1:42:30] claiming your children, claiming,
[1:42:32] speaking, oh God, reminding you of your
[1:42:35] promises, God. And Lord, what you said
[1:42:37] to us because we know that you can't
[1:42:40] break your word, Lord. And that's our
[1:42:42] God. Lord, that's what we are, oh God,
[1:42:45] sure about tonight. Oh God, that your
[1:42:48] all your promises are yay and not nay.

[1:42:58] receive deliverance. God, we receive it.
[1:43:01] Oh God, our children, loved ones, oh
[1:43:05] God, all that we're crying out for.
[1:43:06] Lord, help us, oh God, to as we receive
[1:43:09] the word tonight, God, to be able to lay
[1:43:12] down our burdens, oh God, to be able to
[1:43:14] walk in delivery. Oh God, as our brother
[1:43:17] was saying, God, let a praise break out,
[1:43:19] oh God, let something happen in our
[1:43:22] souls, oh God, that we can sing a new
[1:43:24] song, oh Jesus, come out all that doubt
[1:43:27] and fear, oh God, but sing a song of
[1:43:30] praise, Lord, I thank you, Lord, I love

[1:43:46] continue to strengthen them, Lord, and
[1:43:47] his wife, Lord. Oh God, Lord, bless your
[1:43:50] children, Lord, as we depart this place,
[1:43:53] but never your presence, God, I pray
[1:43:55] that the word, oh God, might go. We
[1:43:58] might ponder on it deep in our hearts.
[1:44:01] Don't let the enemy take it away, but oh
[1:44:03] God, experience it in a mighty way. We
[1:44:07] love you. We appreciate you. Thank you
[1:44:09] again Lord for all things as we depart
[1:44:12] this place but never your presence. Amen
