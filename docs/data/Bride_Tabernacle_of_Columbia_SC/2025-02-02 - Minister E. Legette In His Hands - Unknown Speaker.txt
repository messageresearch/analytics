want to draw n unto thee Lord we thank you this morning we bless your holy name in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good this morning ain't he amen we want to look at the book of Isaiah by the grace of God Isaiah 49 amen is we stand for reading of the word God is so good ain't he amen God is good don't ever think God forgot about you amen amen don't ever thank God forgot about you Hallelujah Isaiah 49 and we'll begin here at the first verse amen we got it say amen and it reads listen oh all unto me and hearken ye people from AAR from far the Lord ha called me from the womb from the bows of my mother hath he made mention of my name and he ha made my mouth like a sharp Sword and the shadow of his hand hath he hidden me and made me a polished shaft and his quiver hath he hidden me and said unto me thou art my servant oh Israel in whom I will be glorified then I said I have labored in vain I have spent my strength for not and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the Lord and my work with my God and now sayth the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob again to him though Israel be not gathered yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord and my God shall be my strength you may be seated we're going to read down a little further amen he says my God be my strength amen come on that's one strength that won't fail amen y'all believe that this morning here in the sixth verse he says and he said it is a light thing that thou shall be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation Toto the end of the Earth thus sayith the Lord the Redeemer of Israel and His Holy One to him whom whom man despiseth and to him whom Nation abh horth the servant of rulers King shall see and arise princes also shall worship because of the Lord that is faithful amen you thank God for being faithful this morning that's one thing I know amen that in all things God is faithful amen amen I can't remember one time where he ever fell Hallelujah he didn't come through amen but he's always been what faithful Amen in all things God is faithful we're not faithful but he is faithful Hallelujah that's why I'm glad he doesn't he doesn't do as as they say like um you know like I guess I don't know the correct terminology but you know Tit for Tat or whatever they call it but God loves you unconditionally amen it's not what you can do or what you've are or what you going to do or can do for him in that way but God loves you just because amen because of you are his elect you believe that this morning and that that's what makes us love God even the more amen when we can see ourselves and know that we don't have what it takes to pay the price Hallelujah we never could pay the price right but he was able to go and pay a debt that he didn't know right even though we oldow he was willing to go pay that debt right and that's what encourages us when the devil try to beat you down sometimes and and look at yourself and all that I just remember that I ain't worthy noow Hallelujah but I'm I only come because God chose me Hallelujah I'm only here because God called me and if God had to call me and and and chose me and predestinated me before the foundation of the world and I wouldn't be here today so it was God choosing it wasn't my choosing so all I can do is just praise God and glorify his name along the way through my ups and downs through my valleys Hallelujah through my trials and tribulations all I can do is say God thank you Lord anyhow Hallelujah he says here in in the in the 7 verse to to the servant of rules of King K shall see and arise princes shall worship because the Lord is faithful and the Holy One of Israel has what chose thee th thus sayith the Lord in an acceptable time have I heard thee how many glad for that and in the day of salvation have I what helped thee and I will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the Earth to cause to inherit the desolate heritages that thou May say to the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness show yourselves they shall feed and do and the ways and their pastures shall be in all high places they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor the sun Smite them for he that have mercy on them shall lead them Hallelujah even in the springs of the waters shall he guide them and I will make all my mountains away and my highways shall be exalted behold these shall come from far and low these from the north and from the from the west and these from the land of Cam sing oh heavens and be joyful o Earth and Break Forth into singing old Mountains for the Lord have comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted but Zion but Zion said the Lord have forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me and this is a question can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on a son of her womb yay they may forget yet will I not forget thee behold I have Graven thee in the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me thy children shall make haste thy destroyers and they that may thee wayte shall go forth lift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather themselves together and come to thee as I live sayth the Lord Thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as an ornament and bind them on thee as a bride doeth may God a bless to the reading of his word this morning God is good amen you know one thing about God he always gives us precious promises don't he amen and I love the Lord for that because one thing I know that God can't break his promises can he amen amen come on we as individuals break our promises all the time but God can't break his amen you know the the more we go into this life and and I want to talk this morning about in in in God's hands Amen in God's hand is in his hands amen and I says that the more we go on in this life you know and and the more we experience some things then that's the more that it's going to either you know your trial tribulation going either bring you further to God or it's going to I mean closer to God or it's going to drive you further away amen but I don't know about you but the more I go through those little ups and downs it brings me just that much closer to God hallelujah that I can look back over some of the victories that God has already brought us through and I can say Lord I I know that throughout all of that God I was in your hands come on how many realize that this morning you know I was telling uh I think it was brother Damon last night I was standing on the church step the other day and and I was thinking about some things and and over the last 20 something years and I said Lord I look at some of the things that I went through and some of the things that I've been through and I said even in all that I said I was in God's hands and all that I've been through and some of you can reach Back 40 years amen I know my little 20 years don't amount to a whole lot but I says I thank God for the 20 years amen because God didn't have to keep you one day did he but he desired to keep you and I say God if you kept me this far Lord I know that you'll keep me keep me on right so we want to talk about in his hands this morning I was thinking about situations and I said in all those situations not one time was I ever out of God's hands amen come on and all that I went through not one time was it I never out of God's hand right but I was in God's hand the whole time Hallelujah and I like that how he lead he led you Hallelujah he going to guide you and one thing about it he said the Lord is faithful right and all of the time seems like to be desolate don't you know that I never hungered Hallelujah I never thirst I might have got to the point to where I thought I was but when I look back I didn't lose no weight Hallelujah I'm talking about spiritual weight now come on I might didn't lose no physical weight neither but we going to talk about that right now come on but I ain't lost no weight did I come on I'm plump in the spirit Hallelujah I still got joy on speakable and full of Glory Hallelujah I'm just as happy today about serving the lord than I was before I started why Hallelujah because all that I've been through God always showed up and solidified Hallelujah made me that much stronger to let me know that I'm here come on Amen Hallelujah I don't age with Time come on I'm just as strong today as I was back then oh Jesus God shows us that don't he but what messes up us up in the is that we see how the world is changing right we see how the world is going on and they getting that much further away from God right to where there sometimes there don't even seem to be an open Vision right but in that time God is still speaking right in a time of no open Vision God came to Samuel one day didn't he begin to speak to him about the lamp that went out Hallelujah and I come to light the fire back oh Jesus and I thank God for that that's been my prayer God light the fire back Hallelujah come on where they cool off at light the fire again come on let it burn Hallelujah and I believe God to do that all you got to do is call for it right come on God is right there waiting all you got to do is call for it a lot of times we realize situations would have been a lot easier Hallelujah if we to looked to the Lord from the beginning right but we waited and we waited then all of a sudden you know but what happens desperation bring God on the scene don't it come on you get desperate enough you learn how to cry out then right come on but then God begins to to show you those things you know uh uh like we always say scriptures become alive in your time of need don't it come on no longer that you just heard it but it becomes it's alive then right come on and I don't know about you but I I love the Living Word Hallelujah I was telling saying about someone the other day I saying you know you need a religion that's going to that's going to help that's going to change you right that's going to be able to do something for you hallelujah amen I know one one of guys got a lot of intellectual knowledge and all that but he can't seem to get over his right he still can't defeat himself he still got all kind of battles in his flesh and all kind of things because I says that what you got ain't changing you Hallelujah but I says that you need something that's going to change amen what's going to change it's going to be more than just the letter of the word but it's going to be the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's why Jesus told Peter and NOS he said after you be converted then go strengthen your brotherr right I know you can't help yourself right now but when the Holy Ghost comes come on and when I put my spirit in you then I'll cause you to walk in my statues Hallelujah you won't have to worry about trying no more it'll be easy now Hallelujah because it'll not be you but it'll be me living in you come on Hallelujah and I thank God for that it's always pray I said Lord help me cuz I'm afraid of myself I don't know what I'm capable of but when he came Hallelujah I didn't have to worry about it no more right because now what it is I just let him take over those times where I don't know what to do I just let go and let God take over come on put it in God's hand and I'm going to let God take over how many feel like doing that this morning come on but I said in his hands come on many of times you know uh like I say you might think because sometimes people have gotten so out of contact with God right so out of contact with the spirit that they forget they acknowledge Him right you know the Bible says that trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not to thine own understanding but in all thy ways do what acknowledge Him right come on ask God about it hallelujah how many want to ask God about it come on I don't know I want to ask God about it God is this your will Hallelujah cuz if it ain't your will then I don't want to do it God but if it's in your will then give me Faith Hallelujah to stand here when the winds begin to blow come on Hallelujah something about it when you acknowledge God and it's God that's leading you no matter where you at when God leading you got faith right you understand that it's God that brought me here hallelujah one thing about the devil he can't cross the blood line can you I always tell tell a testimony about one night I was at the house and a while ago now and you know uh I woke up and feel like I can feel just demon powers all over and I kept like I was hearing something beating at the door and I said uh something was telling me that's fear trying to grip your heart but don't let it come on cuz don't you know fear got torment don't it come on why fear when you can have faith why are you fearing when God is on your side come on if God before us then who can be against us come on sometimes we got to remember that who is on our side Hallelujah sometimes we got to remember who called us who we running the race for Hallelujah but I remember that I got up I walked up to the front door and I can feel like pressures things was demon powers right I might have looked crazy but nobody saw me in the middle of the night but I began talking to the front door I said devil you might snare and you might bite like sister want us the same but you going to lose this battle tonight because you came cross the bloodline Hallelujah the blood has been applied to this home so you might as well go on about your business hallelujah hallelujah I said I'm covered by the blood Hallelujah then I begin to say I said now I'm going back to get me some sleep Hallelujah but what it is the devil want to grip your heart with fear right but when challenges come Hallelujah it might catch you unaware sometimes but then when you remembered who how strong God is come on when you remember what God promised you come on at every place the soul of your foot tread upon I'll give it to you Hallelujah when you remember what God has promised you right that in blessing I'll bless you come on and whom God blessed nobody can't curse oh Jesus things look like they going bad for you but remember you blessed come on in all things Hallelujah make you bed in hell God will bless you there I like how David was one of my always favorite scriptures how David used to say how David said in the presence of my enemies come on he hath anointed my head with all Hallelujah come on it's all right to be anointed in front of all your friends and all that but when you're in the presence of your enemies hallelujah oh Jesus when you're outnumbered by the demon powers trials and tribulations then all of a sudden the anoint oting comes come on then you start realizing Hallelujah you start singing that little song I feel like I can make it hallelujah oh Jesus no matter what comes my way why because the anointing is here hallelujah the rushing Mighty Wind has come oh Jesus in the presence of my enemies oh Jesus come on but you got to get to that place sometimes Hallelujah right come on it's nothing sweeter but in the presence of your enemy God show up Hallelujah come on and to comfort you y'all believe that come on why because you in his hands right I said ain't no situation I was praying I said ain't no situation trial come on if you belong to God that God ain't got control over look like sometimes thing is out of cater right look like you you don't have a handle of the situation but when you ain't got a handle remember you still in God's hands Hallelujah the whole time God's Got control of the situation but it's up to you and I to say Lord I'm leaving it in your hands Hallelujah long as you stay in God's hands you'll be all right hallelujah oh Jesus amen come on I thought about Rahab the Harlot and H you know they knew that destruction was coming to the city right but one thing about it God gave her a token didn't he come on he said long as you hang this out of the window Hallelujah and everybody in the house that's with you come on they'll be sa save Hallelujah but also told them but those that go out we ain't going to be responsible for them now come on you got to stay in the ark Hallelujah like the sister used to saying get in the ark and stay there Hallelujah and be ready when Jesus come come on you got to stay behind the blood now if you get out from behind the blood I can't do nothing for you you on your own but if you stay behind the blood oh Jesus no matter how hard times get Hallelujah no matter how rough the situation get no matter how much the politics of America fall apart God is going to bless you Hallelujah why because you covered by the blood oh Jesus I believe that this morning come on but what it what it is God gets us to those times don't he come on I want to say this morning you in God's hands right amen come on Israel Israel was at a place I believe uh of of identity crisis we can call it come on cuz sometimes they forgot who they were serving right so what God would always do Hallelujah is bring judgment wouldn't he come on he don't do it because he just want to be bring judgment he do it because he love you right come on you belong to God he ain't going to let you go Hallelujah he might put up with certain things for a while but after that little while is over with God going to call one day Hallelujah and you going to have to answer that call ain't you I'm so glad that God called me Hallelujah though I might not want to listen I'm glad that God called me oh Jesus Hallelujah but what happens like it says that even in that time come on uh her Jeremiah I mean Isaiah prophesying to him now we know that you know he was talking about Jesus was going to fulfill this part come on coming and and I like how in Luke 4 Jesus when he came in the temple he begin to to read the scripture where it said in Isaiah he he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me right cuz he have anointed me come on to preach the gospel come on to bring Good Tidings Hallelujah the men the Broken Heart come on set free those that are captive something about God right God comes and he comes for deliverance I like how Isaiah say says here he says that God heard you in an acceptable Time come on come onen God heard you didn't he in an acceptable time Hallelujah one thing about it sometimes we don't think that God hear us come on because look like God showed up right then but God is moving the whole time ain't he come on I said you in his hands this morning but we find that you know they they came to that place right and and they begin to like we say that sometimes have an identity crisis but God want to show that Hallelujah help was on the way right come on they know that they didn't know probably they was going to go down to Babylon and being bondage and all those things but even in all that come on no matter where you at you in God's hand come on amen help is on the way right but then uh they they begin to say Lord uh like you said Zion uh begin to say that the Lord forgot them come on I said God ain't going to forget you this morning amen begin to say that the that the Lord forgot them when they going through how many people feel like that sometimes that the Lord forgot you come on when you going through but he wanted to remind them Hallelujah and I'm so glad this morning Hallelujah that when we forget God remind us sometime come on that you belong to me Hallelujah come on this didn't just start now right as we were saying the other week but before the foundation of the world Hallelujah he already placed your name on the Lamb's Book of Life you didn't realize what God was doing with your life but he knew what he was doing the whole time hallelujah oh Jesus come on but he begin to tell him he said God forgotten about him forgotten us right but he asked him a question and this was deep wasn't it he said can a can a woman right forget her suckling child that's a rough answer ain't it come on but so many of them do today don't they come on can I say that this morning why because we living in a mean world ain't it we living in a world way people have gone in completely insane ain't it come on the brother was preaching the other night violence everywhere right amen but it's one thing about it in the midst of all that chaos and all that violence the love of God is still running rampid ain't it love of God is still reaching Souls Hallelujah and letting you know you don't have to conform to the violence of this world you don't have to be mean cuz everybody else being mean come on but the love of God restrains us don't it come on I believe it was Paul said I'm persuaded that life nor death come on principalities Powers none of that ain't going to be able to do what separate us from what the love of God come on God's love is something about his love you know he says that can a woman uh for get a suckling child then he say yay but he said but I can't forget you come on I can't forget you why come on I say God ain't forgot about you this morning come on think about your situation God ain't forgot about you God a't forgot about your children amen God ain't forgot about your family God ain't forgot about the prayers you cried come on he heard everyone amen and he remembers them all come on not only that but he's faithful come on you just hold on a little while longer oh Jesus come on but he says that I I ain't forgot you come on he said how can I forget you you engraved in the palm of my hands come on right ain't that a blessing come on every time I look at my hands I see you there hallelujah oh Jesus you know what the palms of the hands is used for us use to grip things Hallelujah come on God's got a firm grip on you Hallelujah don't he come on Amen Hallelujah he used to help you feel things come on he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities ain't he he said you in the palm of my hands I engraved you there amen I can't forget you you part of me hallelujah oh Jesus come on I was so stirred I said God thank you for allowing me to be a part of you Hallelujah come on when I forget God reminds me hallelujah oh Jesus come on somebody get the Lord a hand clap of Praise come on I said one thing about it one thing about it come on I said you in his hands right there many examples we can go through this morning in the scriptures where like like I said the thing about it what is God don't just dump you and come back leave you and run off God don't do that man do that God don't do that in the time where you everything is solid don't you realize that God is still there come on Amen sometimes he's waiting to see what you going to do Hallelujah but when you realize that I said Lord in your solid times I'm going still praise you Amen in the solent times I'm going still tell you how good you are am in the silent times when the wind is blowing I'm I'm still say thank you Lord I'mma still say naked I came and naked I leave but blessed be the name of the Lord in my time of sickness I'm going say still the Lord is the god that Health thee in my time of sickness I'm going say with the stripes I am healed when God is silid hallelujah I don't know what to do I ain't going to be silent even when it seems that God is silid but I'm going lift up my voice Hallelujah and I'm going praise God even tomorrow come on come on I believe God wants some ch children like that come on but to realize like we said that that you in God's hands one thing about it when he was talking about this mother here right and forgetting her child I says sometimes we misunderstand God's love right because we thinking about it first off like humans do right come on cuz we can't help ourselves right but to understand that the love of God it supersedes anything we can ever imagine come on God's love supersedes anything that we can ever imagine come on God loves goes to the unlovable right we can't even imagine sometimes the The Depths that God go through the save people right amen amen sometimes we look at people might say oh they they they done they washed up but God love supersedes anything that we can ever think of right amen amen God's love go down to the prison house Hallelujah God's love will go by the hospital won't it God's love will go to the crack house to the liquor store God's love go by and see about that prostitute God's love supersedes anything that we can think about don't it come on it does so we get confused sometime don't we come on we get confused but I said the thing about it is you know to understand that's why he he begin to to give them that that's saying uh about the woman forgetting her her suckling child because that seemed to be almost impossible but he said that she can do that but I can't never forget you right come on devil be all in your ear God can't never forget you amen you might not want to recognize God but he know you right where you're at God you in God's hands ain't it come on I think about Joseph Hallelujah let's talk about him for a little bit right Joseph was in God's hand wasn't he he might have thought that you know sometimes we don't understand why we going through I'm a good Christian right come on I pay my ti I do what the good things but then the winds begin to blow right just because the winds are blowing remember you still in God's hand right come on people jealous of you hate you right false accused him didn't throw them in a pit and sold them into slavery that's hard to believe that I'm still in God's hand right come on but don't you know even in all that he was in God's hands even in all that God might have permitted certain things right but the devil couldn't do no more than what God allowed Hallelujah and when God was going to call a storm up he had to stop didn't he come on I said that this morning you know one thing about it the devil can't do no more than what God allow right come on Amen you in God's hands the devil can't do no more than what God than what God allow come on and all of that I can see Joseph in the end looking back right knowing Hallelujah that the path that he took right knowing that the mountains and the and the valleys and the Low Places right amen and all those things I can see him tell his brothers it wasn't you but it was God hallelujah amen I am what I am because of God brought me here you didn't send me but I was in God's hand amen hallelujah I couldn't see his great plan but I know that I was in his hands Hallelujah and God showed up didn't he come on but it's one thing about that like we says God is faithful this morning Hallelujah it says one thing about it you know uh uh he's talking here he was reminding them come on that that you might be in a a certain place right now or certain going through certain things right now but it ain't going to always be like that come on amen amen come on now amen it ain't always that way amen come on I don't know about you but I'm on the up and up side now come on all right I'm thinking positive I'm on the up and up side like they sometimes you don't know the meaning of of certain script of certain songs until you're going through heavily right then God whisper that song in your ear Hallelujah God whisper that scripture in your ear then you can start that can become your daily bread right Hallelujah that I know my deliverer coming Hallelujah that can be your daily bread come on that I never the righteous forsaken nor is seed begging for bread won't let these things come out of my mouth I know Hallelujah why because God has given me the victory come on yes he has Hallelujah I like that how David like we said you in his hands right come on when you in God's hands he going to hold you up come on y'all believe that this morning when you in God's hand I know it's real simple but when you in God's hand he going to hold you up amen come on ain't he amen when everything else fall he going to hold you up amen come on but if you ain't in his hands you might get through the first Storm come on you might even make it through the second storm but one of these storms is going to knock you out the only thing that's going to hold you up Hallelujah come on you got to be built on a firm foundation amen got to be held up by the rock hallelujah amen oh Jesus and that rock is Christ right you know I I had a dream the other night that uh it was earthquake hitting shaking everything loose and I even in the dream the whole house falling apart everything trees falling over everything looked like it was lost but one thing that wouldn't lost I still have faith in God Amen I was looking at those things I said Lord give and he take away but blessed be the name of the Lord I was looking at those things and I said he might have shook the earthquakes might have shook but I'm still standing on Christ Hallelujah even in the dream I was saying Lord I'm still standing on the Rock everything's shaking away but I'm standing on a rock and that's what matters come on y'all believe that this morning but we hold on to materialistic thing we worry about those things Hallelujah but I'm only concerned about staying in Christ come on cuz all those things are passed away how many believe that this morning come on but what it is you in his hands come on in the middle of earthquake you in his hands come on middle of floods you in his hands amen come on how many times we can talk talk to you about shootout started Hallelujah bullets flying I ain't even know at that time but I was in God's hand come on somebody was praying God had me on his mind what was it in God's hands right come on and that's the safest place to be this morning how many believe that this morning somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise come [Music] on I said you in God's hands sometimes like we said we misunderstand the love of God right oh what God is doing right but he's bringing us two things the trial us right perfect us come on to make you better come on you got to be better than what you are right now amen sometimes people think I've already arrived but no God got something he want to chop off you right come on I've arrived I'm no God got some work he want to work in you amen just by you thinking that you already show that God got some more you got to work in you come on and God is going to do it right and who are we to tell the the the the pot how to form us right who are we to tell the teacher how what he need to do in our life right come on but God knows what he what he need to do to get you where you belong at right come on and he'll do it won't him Hallelujah but we find that I says that what it is we we misunderstand it but it supersedes it said far above that you know the uh uh what we can ask or think many of times and I thinking about how you know the love of God you know and God promises right you know Israel was once and they they begin to murmur against the Lord I want to show you how strong God promis is God got some strong promises come on they begin to murmur against God right building idols and all kind of things and God was going to destroy them wasn't he told Moses he say move out the way I'm going to destroy this people and raise up a nation from you but one thing about the the promise of God God Moses began to tell God he said Lord you need to repent of this thing right the first time God the man ever asked God to repent he hearkened to it but what it was Moses even though God knew Moses was reminding God about the promise that he made you can't do that Lord because you promised Abraham Hallelujah that you was going to bless his seed right it was an unconditional promise amen then in blessing I'll bless you right multiplying I'll multiply you come on you got to honor that promise God and what God do God remembered don't him come on and God honored that promise didn't he amen come on I'm so glad today that God don't go back on his promises I'm so glad today that you can remind God and God do just what he said aren't you glad of that this morning Hallelujah come on but we find that you know I just come to encourage you this morning come on that you in his hands come on many situations many many examples I want to go through the Hebrew boys Hallelujah Daniel Hallelujah we can look out throughout all the scriptures people that's in God's hand amen and can I say they were in the tender hand Hallelujah come on sometimes they look at what they going through come on is that what it's like to be in your hands come on cuz you only looking at it when they going through but you ain't looking what the end look like Hallelujah come on you ain't looking at the end come on cuz when the End come Hallelujah you'll see then hallelujah what God has been shaping you up for hallelujah what he's been building you up for sustaining you up for you'll find out when it's when the real Storm Come Hallelujah come on but I said you in his hands this morning come on are you in God's hands this morning come on one thing about it as we've been preaching here a musicians come this morning I don't want to be long was preaching here lately come on about letting go Hallelujah letting go come on and giving it to God right cuz one thing about it God know how to handle it your situation God know how to handle it don't you what you dealing with don't you know God know how to handle that come on but the problem is we've been trying to handle it for too long am ain't it but the way this world is going your faith is going to have to rise up one day the way the world is going your confidence and Trust going to have to be in one or the other amen and I want to tell you the other is going to fall apart the other going to be cast down but it's one that'll stay solid the whole time it's only one that I know of come on and that's God himself come on I said Lord no matter what comes today or tomorrow God I'm in your hands come on I won't let the devil play with my mind like God don't care about me he cared so much for me he came and died for me come on he cared so much for me and he was longsuffering too come on even in my failures and mistakes God was still there come on why you got to remind yourself God I'm in your hands Hallelujah somebody give the Lord Praise this morning come [Music] on come on we in God's hand amen am come on during the Passover night they were in God's hand
