[29:30] me through." Amen. God has been good
[29:33] this morning. Amen. Let us all stand at
[29:35] this time.
[29:41] Let us bow.
[29:45] Lord Jesus, we thank you for allowing us
[29:46] to come in your house this morning.
[29:49] Lord, we ask that you come down this
[29:51] morning and move us out of the way.
[29:53] Lord, get all the glory, honor, and the
[29:55] praise. Lord, we want your anointing to
[29:57] flow freely in this place this morning,
[29:59] Lord Jesus. Lord, we ask that you would
[30:01] just come down and speak to every
[30:03] heart's need, every heart's desire. And
[30:05] Lord, you know what your people need.
[30:07] And Lord, we ask that you move in a
[30:09] mighty and a special way. In Jesus' name
[30:12] we pray. Amen. Amen.
[30:16] Amen. If you got your Bibles, we'll turn
[30:18] to Genesis chapter 22. Amen.
[30:50] And when you got it, say amen. Amen. And
[30:54] it reads, "And it came to pass after
[30:56] these things that God did tempt Abraham
[30:59] and said unto him,"Abraham, and he said,
[31:02] Behold, here am I." He said, "Take now
[31:05] thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
[31:08] lovest, and get thee into the land of
[31:10] Mariah, and offer him there for a burnt
[31:12] offering upon one of the mountains,
[31:15] which I will tell thee." And Abraham
[31:18] rose up early in the morning and saddled
[31:20] his ass, and took him two of of his
[31:24] young men that were with him, and Isaac
[31:26] his son, and clay the wood for the burnt
[31:28] offering, and rose up, and went unto the
[31:31] place unto the place of which God had
[31:34] told him. And we'll drop down to the the
[31:37] ninth verse. And they came to the place
[31:40] which God had told of him of. And
[31:43] Abraham built an altar there, and laid
[31:45] the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
[31:48] son, and laid him on the altar upon the
[31:51] wood. And Abraham stretched forth his
[31:54] hand, and took the knight to slay his
[31:56] son. And the angel of the Lord called
[31:58] unto him out of heaven, and
[32:00] said,"Abraham,
[32:02] Abraham." And he said, "Here am I." And
[32:05] he said, "Lay not thine hand upon the
[32:07] lad, neither do thou anything unto him,
[32:11] for
[32:13] now I know that thou fearest God." And
[32:16] seeing that thou hast not withheld thine
[32:19] son, thine only son, from me." And
[32:21] Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked,
[32:24] and behold, behind him a ram caught in
[32:26] the in a thicket by his thorns. And
[32:30] Abraham went and took the ram and
[32:32] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[32:34] thestead of his son. God bless the
[32:37] reading of this word. You may be seated.
[32:45] Amen. This morning
[32:50] I'd like to speak on a little thing that
[32:52] a little topic that I entitled the test
[32:55] before the blessing.
[32:57] The test before the blessing. And I I
[33:00] started thinking about this and in verse
[33:02] one it said and God tempted Abraham
[33:05] and just started thinking about that for
[33:07] Abraham this was a test and before
[33:11] before he could get his blessing he had
[33:13] to go through the test. And it wasn't
[33:15] about the test it was how he responded
[33:17] to the test. It wasn't about the test
[33:20] and how how what the magnitude was. God
[33:23] wanted to see how far was Abraham
[33:25] willing to go. Amen. How far was Abraham
[33:28] willing to go after God had promised him
[33:31] his promised him a son? After God had
[33:34] given him a son after so many years,
[33:37] Abraham had waited so long for this
[33:40] promised thing that God had given him.
[33:42] And then God decided to test him to see
[33:45] was he willing to go through the test to
[33:48] get his blessing.
[33:54] And I wanted to read further in here. So
[33:56] we'll go to verse 15 in the scripture.
[33:59] He said, "And the angel of the Lord came
[34:01] unto Abraham out of heaven the second
[34:03] time and said, by myself have I sworn,
[34:06] said the Lord, for because thou hast
[34:09] done this thing, and hast not withheld
[34:12] thine son, thine only son, that in
[34:14] blessing I will bless thee. And in
[34:17] multiply, I will multiply thy seed as
[34:19] the stars of heaven, and as the sand
[34:21] which are upon the seashore, and thy
[34:24] seed shall possess the gates of his
[34:26] enemies. Amen. See, it wasn't just that
[34:30] God spirit God spirit um spared Isaac's
[34:35] life. There was a greater blessing that
[34:37] was in store. There was something that
[34:39] was coming down the pipeline that God
[34:42] wanted to see by the faithfulness of
[34:44] Abraham, I'm not only going to bless
[34:46] you, I'm not only going to bless your
[34:47] son, I'm going to bless you for
[34:49] generations and generations to come. It
[34:52] might just only have been one seed, but
[34:53] that seed was to multiply into a nation.
[34:56] It was to spread around the whole entire
[34:58] world even to this in to this day and
[35:02] said, "But Abraham had to go through
[35:03] that test before he got his blessing."
[35:06] And many of times we can go through life
[35:08] and God will put a test before we get
[35:11] our blessing. But many of times we so
[35:13] stuck on the test that we never realize
[35:16] the blessing is soon to come. We never
[35:18] realize that right beyond the gate,
[35:20] right beyond this door is where God has
[35:23] his greatest blessing for us. But he had
[35:25] us but he makes us go through the test
[35:28] first.
[35:30] Said in the test there's trials and
[35:32] tribulations. In the test there's things
[35:34] that are unforeseen. In the test, God
[35:37] make asked you to do something that may
[35:39] seem hard to you. The Abraham, he asked
[35:42] him to to to sacrifice his son. Now, how
[35:47] many of us would take that and and we be
[35:49] willing to give up our sister or brother
[35:52] or our son or daughter? If God told us
[35:55] that, hey, I need you not only to do it,
[35:57] but I need you to be the hand that takes
[35:59] the life of your son.
[36:02] That's what God asked Abraham to do. But
[36:05] God knew that when Abraham came to that
[36:07] critical moment, he was going to have
[36:09] that ram in the bush. He was going to
[36:11] have a way of escape that Abraham didn't
[36:14] know about. But he wanted to see was
[36:15] Abraham willing to go there. He wanted
[36:18] to see that will Abraham pass the test.
[36:21] Will Abraham be willing to go through
[36:23] the test and will he pass the test?
[36:25] Sometimes you can pass a test. Some
[36:27] people call sees us as passing a test.
[36:31] It is technically passing, but but that
[36:33] ain't what you should strive for. And
[36:36] some people, they they strive for only
[36:37] A's. That's all they that they want to
[36:40] get on their test. But see, when God
[36:42] gives you a test, he want to see what
[36:44] type of grade are you going to receive
[36:45] when you come through this test.
[36:47] Sometimes when you come through a test,
[36:49] it has happened to us all. Well, if you
[36:52] if you take enough tests, you might even
[36:54] fail one.
[36:56] And when you fail it, you realize that
[36:58] one, either your preparation wasn't
[37:00] right, your attitude wasn't right, or
[37:02] you didn't study hard enough. There's so
[37:04] many things that goes into taking a
[37:06] test. But while you're on the test,
[37:08] you're trying to strive for something.
[37:10] When you go to take this test, you're
[37:12] trying to achieve something. And see,
[37:14] when God puts you through the test, he's
[37:16] trying to prove something in you. Many
[37:18] of times, he's trying to prove that I am
[37:20] God and that I change not. Many of times
[37:23] he's trying to prove that if you go
[37:25] through this test, there's something on
[37:27] the other side. When you come through
[37:29] this test, there's something greater on
[37:30] the other side. But first, you got to go
[37:32] through the test. You might not
[37:34] understand the test. You might not
[37:36] understand the trial, but he wants you
[37:38] to go through it because there's
[37:39] something on the other side. It's not
[37:41] for you to know what's on the other side
[37:43] cuz God knows that. It's not for you to
[37:45] understand what's on the other side
[37:47] because he's the one that says, "I know
[37:49] all things, not you." Yeah. Your friends
[37:51] don't know. Your parents don't know, but
[37:53] I know. And when you come through the
[37:55] test, there's something greater on the
[37:57] other side of this test. There's
[37:59] something that when you look back and
[38:00] you can see it all throughout the Bible.
[38:02] When someone went through a test, there
[38:04] was something on the other side. There
[38:06] was something that they achieved that
[38:09] they won. When they got through this
[38:10] test, Abraham, it was generations of it
[38:14] was a generational blessing. Even to
[38:16] this day where the prophet of God said
[38:19] that we fall under this generational
[38:20] blessing that where the devil may try to
[38:23] come and attack us. He says that I've
[38:25] given you that you can possess the gates
[38:28] of your enemy. You can have the have
[38:30] whatever may be behind these gates
[38:33] because God has given you the victory.
[38:35] When he went to Calvary and he died for
[38:37] you, he gave you the victory. There's
[38:39] nothing that can stand in between you
[38:41] and getting what God has for you. All
[38:43] you got to do is accept it and say,
[38:45] "Lord, I surrender. I give it to you."
[38:48] And he said, "You can have ask what you
[38:49] will and I'll do it for you." See, God
[38:52] has a way of bringing you through the
[38:54] test because there's a blessing on the
[38:56] other side. Amen. See, God couldn't save
[38:58] the whole world if he didn't die on the
[39:00] cross. That was his test. See, he had to
[39:04] go through the cross. He had to shed his
[39:06] blood for you and me so that that when
[39:08] he came through his test, we can be
[39:10] blessed to be allowed to go to heaven.
[39:12] Amen. See, that was the test he had to
[39:14] go through. And throughout the
[39:16] scriptures, we start I started to look
[39:18] and I started to see and I thought about
[39:20] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. What
[39:22] was their test? Their test was to see if
[39:26] they if they could hold on to if they if
[39:29] they can hold on hold true to their
[39:31] convictions.
[39:33] That was their test. When Shadrach,
[39:35] Meshach, and Abedneo in Daniel 3:3,
[39:39] when they came to it and they had
[39:42] created this fiery furnace and they were
[39:45] putting them in there, their test was,
[39:47] will you hold on to your convictions?
[39:50] Will you hold on to what you believe is
[39:52] true? And if it is true, will you
[39:55] willing to die for it? Amen. See, but
[39:58] when they came through, when they put
[40:00] them in the fiery furnace, every devil
[40:02] that was leading them in the fiery
[40:04] furnace, they they they died on the way.
[40:07] The heat was so high. It it's something
[40:09] to see how how God can protect you in
[40:12] the m when the devil is all around you.
[40:15] See, the people that died, I'm walking
[40:17] right next to you, the one next to you
[40:19] die, but you still alive.
[40:21] I'm walking right next to you. This one
[40:23] fall by the wayside, but you keep going.
[40:25] That's right. That's what happened to
[40:27] him. And you wonder why this one get in
[40:30] a car accident and you in the car right
[40:32] beside him and no scratches, no nothing.
[40:35] But see, God has a way of protecting
[40:37] you. And see they see that was all if if
[40:40] God didn't do if they didn't even get in
[40:42] the fire, just seeing that was a miracle
[40:44] enough. Amen. It should have been a
[40:46] miracle enough. But when they got in the
[40:48] fire, the fire burned everything except
[40:50] for them. It burned all the chains loose
[40:53] and all they did was they got there and
[40:55] they had the right attitude. They said,
[40:56] "I'm going to glorify God." Cuz what I
[40:59] recogniz is this is not something that
[41:01] we did. Is that we held true and we
[41:03] waited on God to show up on the scene.
[41:06] We waited on him to come down and say,
[41:08] "Lord, you we believe that you are the
[41:10] one true and living God. And if you're
[41:12] the true and living God, then you will
[41:14] show up when we need you to show up. And
[41:16] Lord, this is not we are living as a
[41:18] testimony. We gave your word and we know
[41:21] that you got to show up. When we ask
[41:23] that you come on the scene, you said
[41:25] when two or three are gathered in my
[41:26] name, there I be in the midst. So it's
[41:28] three of us right here. So Lord, we know
[41:30] that you're right here. And Lord, we
[41:32] just want you to be visible. We just
[41:34] want you to show yourself and show
[41:36] others that, hey, what we talking about
[41:38] is real. When Nebuchadnezzar saw it, he
[41:41] said that looks like the son of God.
[41:43] Amen.
[41:45] It's something that someone that had
[41:47] never seen God recognized him when he
[41:50] saw him. Just like Paul on the on the
[41:53] way to Emmas, it could have been any
[41:55] voice, but he said, "Who art thou?"
[41:59] Yes. Yeah. Amen. That's right. But but
[42:02] when Paul was there, he he he was on the
[42:05] road and when the voice came to him, he
[42:06] said, "Who art thou, Lord?" See, when
[42:09] God calls you, you recognize the voice.
[42:11] Amen. It's something that you recognize.
[42:14] And Neb Nebuchadnezzar when he seen it,
[42:16] he said that that's that's that's that
[42:19] didn't we send three in that fire. Why
[42:22] do we why do I see four? And he called
[42:25] them out of the fire. Now, it's one
[42:27] thing to go in the fire. It's a whole
[42:28] another thing to come up out of it. See,
[42:31] that was their test. They had to go to
[42:34] the fire. They had to be bound and get
[42:37] thrown in the fire. And then they had to
[42:39] come back out the fire. See, it was a
[42:41] whole cycle that they had to go through.
[42:43] But all the while, God was just cleaning
[42:45] them up. He was just making sure that
[42:47] when they came out that they had a
[42:49] stronger testimony than they had before.
[42:51] When they came through the trials and
[42:53] tribulation, they had a stronger
[42:55] testimony than they did before. They can
[42:57] stand on it and say, "You know what? I
[42:59] seen God and he was with me." Not only
[43:02] was he with me every day, he was with me
[43:04] in my test. He was with me in my trial.
[43:07] He was with me in the fire. And no
[43:09] matter how hot the fire got, he was
[43:11] still right there with me. And he was
[43:13] blocking the flame from burning me. He
[43:16] was blocking the flames from catching on
[43:18] me. See, he was right there in my fire.
[43:21] Amen. But I was not consumed. Amen. See,
[43:25] he was right there in my test, but I was
[43:27] not consumed. He said that that and when
[43:30] you realize that, see, when you when
[43:32] they they were able to hold true to what
[43:34] they believed,
[43:35] when they came through and they held
[43:37] true to what they believed, God showed
[43:39] up. They It wasn't a fake God. It wasn't
[43:42] one of those statues. It was a real God.
[43:45] It was something that they could prove
[43:46] over and over and say, "This is the God
[43:48] that I serve. This is the God that I
[43:51] serve." And if you don't believe me, we
[43:53] got a witness. Nebuchadnezzar can
[43:55] witness that God was in there with me.
[43:57] Amen. We got a witness that the sinner
[43:59] can witness that God was right here with
[44:01] me. I They might say, "I don't know how.
[44:04] I don't know why. I don't even
[44:05] understand how I recognized it, but God
[44:08] was right here with me." See, and when
[44:11] when you have a testimony, sometimes God
[44:14] is trying to show others. He got to take
[44:16] you through the test to get them to have
[44:18] a a correct testimony. He got to take
[44:21] you through the trial so others can see
[44:22] that God is with you. Amen. How would
[44:25] you know God is with you if you ain't
[44:27] never seen him work? How would you know
[44:29] God is with you if you've never
[44:31] experienced him with you? How would you
[44:33] know that God is with you if you've
[44:34] never seen him keep you safe? If you've
[44:36] never seen him provide for you, if
[44:38] you've never seen him heal you, if
[44:40] you've never seen him deliver you.
[44:42] Sometimes it's good to hear everybody
[44:44] else testimony, but sometimes you got to
[44:46] have your own. You got to have your own
[44:49] experience where you can lean down and
[44:51] say, "No, God did this for me. God might
[44:54] have did it for mom and daddy, but he
[44:55] also did it for me. He might have did it
[44:58] for sister and brother, but he also did
[44:59] it for me. Amen. See, I can point to my
[45:04] test that God brought me through for my
[45:06] blessing. Amen. I can point to my trial
[45:09] and say, "God brought me through this
[45:10] and realize that it was only because it
[45:12] was a blessing for me." See, I realized
[45:16] what God was working on even though I
[45:18] didn't understand it while I was going
[45:20] through it. Amen. I realize that
[45:22] afterwards when I look back over my
[45:24] life, see that that when some things
[45:27] they become real to you, but it only is
[45:29] real after you come through time. Amen.
[45:32] It's only when you look back and you
[45:34] realize God was there from he was there
[45:36] all the time as the songwriter said said
[45:40] God was there and he was bringing us
[45:41] through.
[45:43] And I thought about it. I I thought
[45:45] about in the New Testament in Luke 8
[45:47] where there was the woman with the issue
[45:49] of blood. Now, what was her test? She
[45:52] had a twofold test. She had a disease
[45:55] that was incurable
[45:58] and then she had a crowd that she had to
[46:00] get through to get to Jesus. Amen.
[46:03] Now, some people, they would have just
[46:04] stopped at one of those and said, "It's
[46:06] enough for me." But she was so
[46:09] determined that even if she had the
[46:11] crawl, stretch, and claw, she was going
[46:13] to get to Jesus. But she had a
[46:15] determination also. She said, "I don't
[46:17] need Jesus to pray for me. I just need
[46:21] to touch his garment.
[46:23] What level of faith is that?
[46:26] I don't need the pastor to call pray for
[46:29] me. All I need to do is get on my knees
[46:31] and pray."
[46:33] She had such great faith. She said, "If
[46:35] this is the same God that can that heals
[46:38] all diseases." And so she went to him
[46:41] and
[46:42] and she crawled and she finally got to
[46:44] him and
[46:50] and she and touched the border of his
[46:52] garment and immediately her issue of
[46:55] blood was staunch
[46:57] and Jesus said who touched me and that
[47:00] and that was pivotal because sometimes
[47:03] you know when you touch somebody
[47:04] sometimes they don't feel it you could
[47:07] touch somebody on the shoulder and and
[47:09] don't even phase him. But when she
[47:11] touched Jesus, something happened. See,
[47:14] it was when she touched the master and
[47:16] her faith ignited with the healing power
[47:18] of Jesus. There was something had to
[47:21] take place. Her faith had reached such a
[47:23] high level. I think as she got closer to
[47:26] Jesus, the stronger her faith got. As
[47:29] she got closer to him, she her she got
[47:31] more embold and said, "I'm almost there
[47:34] now. My healing is almost here." Amen.
[47:36] my he see she had that faith that when
[47:39] and when I believe that she had the
[47:40] faith that when she touched him she knew
[47:42] something was going to happen
[47:44] it wasn't a might or maybe it wasn't
[47:46] something that she was trying to
[47:48] discover she knew something was going to
[47:50] happen and so when it happened she said
[47:52] who touched me
[47:54] and he said unto her daughter be of good
[47:57] comfort thy faith has made thee whole it
[48:00] wasn't nothing that she did it was her
[48:02] faith that when it touched Jesus it made
[48:04] her whole see but That was her test. And
[48:07] when she got through the test and she
[48:09] got through the crowd, she real she had
[48:11] she recognized her blessing. And I
[48:14] realized and I started to think of
[48:16] continue to think about it and and I was
[48:19] like, whenever there was a great
[48:21] blessing, there was always a trial that
[48:22] came first.
[48:24] Whenever you look back in the Bible,
[48:26] whenever there was a great blessing,
[48:28] there was a trial that came first. and
[48:31] and and and I and I started to
[48:34] thinking about the children of Israel
[48:36] coming out of Egypt. And when when the
[48:39] children of Israel came out of Egypt, I
[48:41] actually want to turn to it. Exodus
[48:45] Exodus 12.
[48:52] And you may ask what was the test that
[48:55] they had? the test that they had that
[48:57] they were in bondage for 430
[49:01] years. They were in bondage in for 430
[49:05] years. And
[49:09] when they got in bondage,
[49:12] the God allowed them, he promised them
[49:14] that a savior was coming. There was a
[49:17] savior that was on the way. There was a
[49:18] savior that was coming. There was one
[49:21] day God was going to deliver his people.
[49:23] One day, God was going to deliver his
[49:25] people. when it took 430 years before
[49:28] God delivered his people. When God when
[49:30] he said it on day one, it wasn't any
[49:33] less of a promise on day one of 430 than
[49:36] it was on day 431.
[49:40] It was the same promise. It was the same
[49:43] thing. Now, many people might have gone
[49:44] on and passed away, but one day they I
[49:47] think that they believe that God's going
[49:48] to deliver his people. God's going to
[49:51] deliver his people. See, but the test
[49:53] that they had to endure was going
[49:55] through being under affliction of the
[49:58] Egyptians. And then God sent these
[50:01] plagues on the Egyptian.
[50:03] But when God sent these plagues on the
[50:05] Egyptian, he sent 11 plagues. But on the
[50:07] 12th plague, he said, "I'm going to
[50:09] allow this to affect everyone."
[50:13] This was a different test because this
[50:16] one didn't just affect the Egyptian.
[50:17] This one affect all the Hebrews and all
[50:19] their households. And on this and on
[50:22] this one, he said that God was going to
[50:25] kill the firstborn sons, but there was a
[50:27] way of escape.
[50:29] All you had to do was you had to get a
[50:32] lamb and you had to kill this lamb and
[50:33] you had to put the blood on the doorpost
[50:35] and you had to be inside inside of that
[50:37] home under that blood or you would not
[50:40] be spared. See, there was there was
[50:42] directions that you had to follow in
[50:45] order in order to be saved. There was a
[50:49] things that you had to follow and that
[50:50] was your test. That was your test. It
[50:53] was a simple set of instructions. All
[50:56] you had to do was kill this lamb, put a
[50:58] blood on the doorpost and be under the
[51:00] be under the shelter of the blood and
[51:03] you'd be saved.
[51:05] And see sometime God make things real
[51:07] simple. He allow you he put the
[51:09] direction in there plain and straight
[51:11] and all you have to do is follow them.
[51:14] And some people say, "I this just too
[51:17] much for me." When God most time, he
[51:20] only put a three-step process. Now, if
[51:23] everything in life was full of
[51:24] three-step processes, life would be real
[51:26] simple.
[51:28] If you could fix your if you could fix
[51:29] your car in three steps, no matter what
[51:31] the problem was, you life would be real
[51:33] simple.
[51:35] I mean, if you could give somebody
[51:36] directions and only had to tell them
[51:38] three steps,
[51:40] hey, everything everything would be
[51:42] simple. But God has a has a way of
[51:45] making things simplistic. And all he
[51:47] asks is that you that that you give him
[51:49] everything and he'll give you even more
[51:51] than you can ask or think. And so when I
[51:54] started reading this, I want to start in
[51:56] verse 37. at the end of the scripture
[52:01] actually in verse 31
[52:03] and this is after the death of all the
[52:06] firstborn of the Egyptians. God God
[52:09] those ones that was under the blood he
[52:11] spared their firstborn and it it was
[52:14] shocking to see he said he not only
[52:16] killed the firstborn of the humans he
[52:17] killed them of the cattle too. Amen.
[52:22] He killed them of the cattle too. And I
[52:23] said well God has his way of doing what
[52:26] he wants to do. Amen. But in verse one,
[52:29] Pharaoh he there was such a cry of
[52:32] anguish in in in in Egypt that night
[52:36] when all these people died. He that
[52:39] Pharaoh he called in Moses and Aaron
[52:42] verse 31 by night and said rise up and
[52:44] get you forth from among my people. See
[52:48] after they had come through that final
[52:49] and last test, Pharaoh was happy to let
[52:52] him go. He said, "Rise up in the middle
[52:54] of the night." He said, "Rise up and get
[52:58] you forth from among my people, both ye
[53:00] and the children of Israel, and go serve
[53:02] the Lord as you have said."
[53:05] Also, he he not only let them go, he
[53:08] said, "Also take your flocks and your
[53:10] herd as ye have said, and be gone and
[53:12] bless me also." Many of times when you
[53:15] coming through someone that the person
[53:17] that give you the hardest problem, they
[53:19] say, "Please pray for me."
[53:21] after they done gave you the roughest
[53:23] time and and the Lord done allow you to
[53:25] pass the test, they be like, "Please
[53:27] pray for me. I need so much help." And
[53:30] you'll be like, "Lord,
[53:32] this a whole new test."
[53:35] But God allowed you to understand that,
[53:37] you know what? Some things God, it's
[53:39] just like he did Abraham. God tempted
[53:42] Abraham. Amen. God sent that test. It
[53:45] wasn't the person, it wasn't the thing.
[53:47] God allowed it to be so. He justified it
[53:49] and said, "I want you to go through
[53:51] this. So, I'm going to make a way that
[53:52] you'll have to go through it." And he is
[53:55] only for your good. It's only that you
[53:58] can build character that I can give you
[54:00] greater than what you have now. Because
[54:02] if you don't go through this, you can
[54:04] never grow. If you don't go through
[54:05] this, you can never achieve what I need
[54:07] you to achieve, what I want you to
[54:09] achieve. So, I'm going to take you
[54:10] through it until you learn, until you
[54:13] grow, until you no longer are a baby,
[54:15] but you become a you become a young
[54:17] adult. You become a man. and you become
[54:18] a woman, you got to go through these
[54:20] things. Amen. And each journey is
[54:23] different and each one's journey is
[54:25] different. But he also in verse 33 and
[54:28] he said, "And the Egyptians were urgent
[54:30] upon the people that they may send them
[54:33] out of the land in haste, for they said,
[54:36] we be all dead men." And the people took
[54:39] their dough before it was leavened in
[54:41] their kneading troughs
[54:44] being bound upon their clothes upon
[54:46] their shoulders. And the children of
[54:47] Israel did according to the word of
[54:50] Moses. And they borrowed of the
[54:51] Egyptians jewels to of silver and jewels
[54:54] of gold and raignment.
[54:57] And the Lord gave the people favor in
[54:59] the sight of the Egyptians. So that they
[55:01] lent unto them such as they had
[55:03] required. And they spoiled the
[55:05] Egyptians. that this thing it got me
[55:08] because I I started reading this and I
[55:10] read and and I realized I said you know
[55:14] now we don't know if the if the Hebrews
[55:16] they were poor but they didn't have what
[55:18] the Egyptians had now at that time the
[55:21] Egyptians was the ruling nation of the
[55:23] world they had they had conquered so
[55:26] many areas so they had the gold and the
[55:28] silver and before the Israelites left
[55:31] God allowed them to take all the Jews
[55:33] from Before
[55:36] they came out of that test and trial,
[55:38] God allowed them to to become greater
[55:40] than they ever was. God, they took all
[55:43] the riches. It said they spoiled the
[55:45] Egyptians, which means many of times
[55:47] when you go to world war and you spoil
[55:50] your enemy. That means you ransack them.
[55:52] You take all the valuables. They said
[55:55] they spoil the Egyptians. And I thought
[55:57] about it. I said, you know, even in your
[55:59] test, God can bless you. On the way out
[56:02] of your test, God can bless you. so so
[56:04] much greater than you thought. They
[56:06] said, "God ain't going to leave you
[56:08] going out of there poor." He said, "No,
[56:09] I'm going to bless you highly than you
[56:11] thought. I'm going to make sure that you
[56:13] got all the procision provisions that
[56:15] you need when you come out of this." He
[56:17] and he wasn't sending them. Now, it was
[56:19] just going to the wilderness. What they
[56:21] need all the gold and all that stuff
[56:22] for? But God blessed them. God gave it
[56:25] to him. He said, "All that your enemy
[56:27] was storing up, all that your enemy was
[56:30] keeping to themselves, I'm going to
[56:32] provide a way. Now, I'm going to give it
[56:33] to you." You want to fight, you want to
[56:36] work hard, you want to ask for this, but
[56:38] instead, I can just give it to you.
[56:40] Amen. Amen. All you had to do was go
[56:43] through this test. Amen. Now, this
[56:45] probably stuff that they've been storing
[56:46] up for years and years. And not only
[56:48] that, I'm going to make it so that the
[56:50] people are willing to give it to you.
[56:53] You don't have to even fight for it.
[56:55] They're going to be like, "Please take
[56:56] it." Now, just imagine if God started
[56:59] blessing you like that on the way out of
[57:02] your test so that when you coming out of
[57:05] this, someone said, "Hey, I want to give
[57:06] you this."
[57:08] And on the way out of their test, they
[57:11] spoiled the Egyptians. God just blessed
[57:13] them with everything that they they went
[57:15] to him and asked for him. They said,
[57:16] "Please take it." Blessing, Jesus.
[57:19] I I it started a marvel to me cuz I
[57:22] realized that see In order to get their
[57:25] blessing, they had to go through the
[57:27] test. Order to get their blessings, they
[57:29] had to follow the steps that God had
[57:31] provided to be saved. But when they came
[57:33] out, there was something greater on the
[57:35] other side. There was something greater
[57:38] on the other side. Now, when I started
[57:40] looking at it, I said, you know what?
[57:41] Always so stuck in the test that we
[57:43] forget about the greater on the other
[57:45] side. We forget about there streets made
[57:48] of gold. There's a mansion that I got
[57:50] over there. We we forget about some of
[57:52] that type of stuff cuz we're so focused
[57:54] on the test. We're so focused on what we
[57:57] can see and what we can accomplish that
[57:59] we forget about the other side of the
[58:02] ble of the test. Amen. This life is just
[58:05] nothing but a short test. When you when
[58:07] you look at the option and realize that
[58:09] the other side is eternity, this life is
[58:11] nothing but a short test. And on the
[58:14] other side of this test is a greater
[58:16] blessing than we can even imagine. And
[58:18] when I started to think about it, I
[58:20] said, "You know what? We're so You don't
[58:22] want to get so focused on the test that
[58:24] you miss out on getting your blessing.
[58:26] You don't want to get so focused on the
[58:28] things over here that you miss out on
[58:30] doing what God asked you to do so that
[58:32] you can make it there."
[58:35] See, but God has given you everything on
[58:38] this earth. He said he give you he you
[58:40] can possess all the gates of your enemy
[58:42] because he said, "I defeated every enemy
[58:45] at the cross." Amen. Every devil that
[58:47] you may struggle with, he said, "I
[58:49] defeated them." And whether that's
[58:51] sickness, whether that's mental, whether
[58:53] that's physical, God said, "I delivered
[58:55] you from it all." Hallelujah. He said,
[58:57] "I gone forth and I destroyed all these
[59:00] enemies. I went to death, hell, and the
[59:02] grave. I went down there so you don't
[59:04] have to go." I went down there and
[59:07] defeated them all so that you wouldn't
[59:09] have to go there. I I did something that
[59:12] most wouldn't have done and no human
[59:14] could have done. He said, "I'm the lamb
[59:16] that was slain that could take the
[59:18] book." See, he's God. And he said, "I'm
[59:21] the only one that could do it. So, I did
[59:23] it for you." I did it for me. He did it
[59:26] for me. He did it for each and every one
[59:28] of us. That one day that we can realize
[59:30] that he went through the test so that I
[59:32] can be blessed. He went through the
[59:35] trial so that I can be blessed. So that
[59:37] I would have an opportunity to one say
[59:39] one day say, "Lord, thank you for going
[59:42] through the test for me. Lord, thank you
[59:44] for going through this trial for me.
[59:46] Lord, thank you for dying for me. Amen.
[59:49] And I realized that when I when I was
[59:52] doing this, it started making me rejoice
[59:54] of of of the test and the trial. You
[59:57] started looking at my I started looking
[59:59] at a test and a trial differently. I
[1:00:02] started praying. I said, "Lord, direct
[1:00:03] my steps in the test." Amen. Lord,
[1:00:06] direct my path in the test. Lord, I
[1:00:09] could go through this test for this long
[1:00:11] and this long, but Lord, you can lead me
[1:00:13] straight on through the test. Lord, you
[1:00:15] can take me right on through the trial.
[1:00:17] You can allow me to get the shortest way
[1:00:19] possible so that I can reach my
[1:00:21] blessing. So that I can reach where you
[1:00:23] want me to be. I can reach where you
[1:00:25] have me to be, Lord. And that I'm no
[1:00:27] longer stagnant, sitting by the side
[1:00:29] wondering what you would have me to do,
[1:00:31] Lord. I read a scripture one time. It's
[1:00:33] in it's in the Bible and it said um
[1:00:38] it said and God was Elijah had run to
[1:00:41] the back side of the desert and when he
[1:00:43] got to the back side of the desert one
[1:00:46] day he was just sitting there and God
[1:00:48] came and visited him. He said Elijah
[1:00:50] what does thy hear?
[1:00:52] He had him run. He had gotten to such a
[1:00:55] low state that God had to go visit him
[1:00:57] and say what you doing here? What are
[1:00:59] you doing here? And sometimes God will
[1:01:01] come to you and say, "What are you doing
[1:01:02] here?"
[1:01:04] Where you are and what you're doing,
[1:01:06] what are you doing here?
[1:01:08] Is this what I purpose for you to do?
[1:01:10] Yes, Jesus. And if you don't know what
[1:01:13] your purpose is, then you have to ask
[1:01:15] God, Lord, what what would you have me
[1:01:18] to do? You have to go to him and say,
[1:01:20] Lord, what would you have me to do? And
[1:01:22] Elijah said,
[1:01:25] and and he he the Lord went to him and
[1:01:27] said, "What doest thou here?" And many
[1:01:30] of times that's a question that you
[1:01:31] don't want to ask yourself
[1:01:33] because you have a realization with
[1:01:35] yourself. What am I doing here? What's
[1:01:38] my purpose? What am I doing here? Where
[1:01:40] am I going with this? Where will it lead
[1:01:43] me? And sometimes many a times someone
[1:01:46] said something to me recently. It says
[1:01:48] sometimes God will show you and you can
[1:01:51] see it but you don't want to believe
[1:01:53] what you see.
[1:01:55] Sometimes you can see the end of a road,
[1:01:57] but you don't want to believe that's the
[1:01:59] end of the road.
[1:02:01] There was a sign that said, "This is a
[1:02:02] dead end.
[1:02:05] This is a dead end." And but but as
[1:02:07] you're traveling down the road, you slow
[1:02:09] up your speed to see how long it's going
[1:02:11] to take you to get down this dead end.
[1:02:13] But you read the sign. You believed the
[1:02:16] sign, but you but you didn't you didn't
[1:02:19] want to turn around and go a different
[1:02:20] way because turning around me might have
[1:02:23] meant that you had to admit that I made
[1:02:25] a mistake. It might have had you admit
[1:02:29] that, hey, there was something that I
[1:02:31] need that's greater than me. Hey, I
[1:02:33] can't handle this by myself. It might
[1:02:35] have had all those effects on you, but
[1:02:37] instead you decide to go down the dead
[1:02:39] end street. And when you get down there,
[1:02:42] you still got to go somewhere cuz that
[1:02:44] ain't the end of your journey. You might
[1:02:46] have just come down to the end of the
[1:02:48] street. But see, God is saying that,
[1:02:50] hey, these, you can go down there and
[1:02:52] find out that there's a dead end. Or you
[1:02:54] can go down this other path right over
[1:02:57] here where he said, "My yoke is easy and
[1:03:00] my burden is light." You can go down
[1:03:02] this other path over here. And when you
[1:03:04] go down this path, there there's going
[1:03:07] to be some tests and trials on this
[1:03:09] path. But behind every test and trial,
[1:03:11] there's something that's greater behind
[1:03:13] it. When when you come through it, you
[1:03:15] can realize that there's something
[1:03:16] that's greater behind this. When when
[1:03:19] when I come through it, there's
[1:03:20] something that I can look forward to on
[1:03:22] that other path. There's nothing to look
[1:03:24] forward to. There's only death, hell,
[1:03:26] and destruction. Amen. That's all that
[1:03:28] there is. And you're fighting and you're
[1:03:31] fighting a fighting someone that's
[1:03:33] fighting you to go where you where you
[1:03:35] seem to be headed.
[1:03:37] And as you head down that path, I want
[1:03:40] to ask you, what are you doing there?
[1:03:44] As you go down your path and you make
[1:03:47] your decisions and choices, I want to
[1:03:49] ask you, what are you doing there?
[1:03:52] Where is it going to lead you?
[1:03:55] Where is it going to lead you? Is it
[1:03:57] something that's going to lead you into
[1:03:58] something greater?
[1:04:00] When you get done, is you going to have
[1:04:02] you going to have greater blessings than
[1:04:04] what God can give you? Are you going to
[1:04:06] have greater success than what God can
[1:04:08] give you? Are you going to have greater
[1:04:10] greater higher heights than what God can
[1:04:12] give you?
[1:04:16] That's the question that you have to ask
[1:04:17] yourself because because when you look
[1:04:20] back at it, nobody can make that
[1:04:21] decision but you. Nobody can make that
[1:04:24] choice but you. But you have to make the
[1:04:26] choice. When when will enough be enough?
[1:04:29] When will I realize that hey, the road
[1:04:31] I'm going down has a dead end?
[1:04:34] When will I realize that when I get down
[1:04:36] here, I'm just going through tests just
[1:04:38] to go through them. I'm just going
[1:04:40] through trials and tribulations just to
[1:04:41] go through them. There ain't no reward
[1:04:43] when I get there. There ain't no reward
[1:04:45] when I get there. But if I go through
[1:04:47] what God has for me, there's a reward
[1:04:49] there. There's something I can look
[1:04:51] forward to. There's something that's
[1:04:53] greater than you and I. That's is
[1:04:55] greater than I can look back and say,
[1:04:57] "Lord, when when I got done, he's going
[1:05:00] to ask me what did I do with the life he
[1:05:02] gave me? Yes. He's going to ask me,
[1:05:04] "What did I do with it? Did I squander
[1:05:07] it? Did I throw it away? Did I live it
[1:05:09] up with righteous living? Did I have a
[1:05:11] talent and I went and buried it? Or did
[1:05:13] I use it and multiplied it and I used it
[1:05:15] for his good pleasure?" Yes, sir. Yes,
[1:05:17] Jesus. But what what why are you sitting
[1:05:21] where you are?
[1:05:23] If God has something that he wants you
[1:05:24] to do, sometimes he'll take you there to
[1:05:27] show you that, hey, there's a great
[1:05:29] there's an easier pathway for you to go.
[1:05:32] There's something that you can do.
[1:05:33] There's a greater way that you can go
[1:05:35] that God has lead you and guide you. And
[1:05:37] when you get down there, you realize
[1:05:39] that the test has become your blessing.
[1:05:42] My scripture for the other day was all
[1:05:44] things work together for the good. To
[1:05:45] them that love God, to them that are
[1:05:47] called accord to his purpose. See, but
[1:05:50] don't quote the first part. Remember
[1:05:52] that to them that love God. That's
[1:05:53] right. Quote quote the other part. Them
[1:05:56] that are called according to his
[1:05:57] purpose. Amen. See, see there's there's
[1:06:00] some things that you also have to do.
[1:06:02] But God allowed the things that you
[1:06:04] thought was meaningless and thought that
[1:06:06] you had gone the wrong way. He allowed
[1:06:07] that just to be a test that turns into a
[1:06:10] blessing. Amen. He allows that to be a
[1:06:12] part of your testimony. He allows that
[1:06:14] to be something that grows into
[1:06:16] something greater that one day that you
[1:06:17] can look back and say, you know what,
[1:06:19] even though I might have made the wrong
[1:06:21] steps and wrongs decision, God turned it
[1:06:23] around for me. God did a work that I
[1:06:26] could not explain. And I don't know how
[1:06:28] I got to where I am, but God did the
[1:06:31] work. And when I look back and see that
[1:06:33] God did the work, all I can do is give
[1:06:35] the glory to him. I It's nothing to
[1:06:37] serve God. It's nothing to to do what
[1:06:40] God asked me to do because I realize
[1:06:42] where he brought me from and where I
[1:06:44] could have been and I should have been,
[1:06:45] but I'm not there because the grace and
[1:06:48] mercy of God. Amen. See, I'd rather take
[1:06:51] these tests that God gives me because I
[1:06:54] know they're going somewhere that one
[1:06:56] day I'll end up where where God wants me
[1:06:58] to be. And that's that that's that's the
[1:07:01] that's that's the whole point of living
[1:07:03] life. What why else are you living life?
[1:07:07] What does living life achieve? There are
[1:07:10] so many people when you get enough
[1:07:12] money, money is just money. If you get
[1:07:15] enough of it to everybody that that's a
[1:07:18] different limit for everybody. But when
[1:07:20] you get enough money,
[1:07:22] it's just money.
[1:07:25] When you get enough fame, it's just
[1:07:27] fame. When you get enough popularity,
[1:07:29] it's just popularity.
[1:07:31] And sometimes then it becomes a
[1:07:32] headache. You get enough money, more
[1:07:35] people going to ask you for money. Not
[1:07:37] just becomes a headache. But but you
[1:07:39] see, God has something that the more you
[1:07:42] deposit into it, the greater it becomes.
[1:07:46] Amen. The more you deposit into it, the
[1:07:48] greater it becomes. And when you when
[1:07:50] you look back, you you may never know
[1:07:53] how much is worth until you get to the
[1:07:55] other side.
[1:07:57] How much the small things are worth
[1:07:59] until you get to the other side. But
[1:08:02] this morning, God wants you to make the
[1:08:05] right decision. God wants you to say,
[1:08:08] "Lord, I I can I can go through my test
[1:08:10] and trial or I can go through the ones
[1:08:12] that you have for me." And that and I
[1:08:15] know that these tests will lead to
[1:08:17] something that's greater than I can ever
[1:08:18] imagine. I can go through these tests
[1:08:21] and I can I can go and I can continue to
[1:08:23] fight on that one day uh I want to hear
[1:08:26] you say, "Well done, my good and
[1:08:28] faithful servant." And if I'm not going
[1:08:30] on the right way, I don't think I ever
[1:08:32] lose living for you.
[1:08:35] if I don't think I'll lose if I if I if
[1:08:38] I live for you each and every day. But
[1:08:40] God has a way that making your test and
[1:08:43] trial a blessing. He has a way of making
[1:08:46] sure that all things work to the good.
[1:08:48] Amen. He has a way of making sure that
[1:08:50] one day when you come to the the end of
[1:08:53] your journey, you can say, "I I I fought
[1:08:55] a good fight." Amen. And I finished my
[1:08:57] course. Amen. Now, you never know when
[1:09:00] that when that moment will come for you.
[1:09:02] Cuz everybody moment is different. But
[1:09:05] when you get to that moment, you want to
[1:09:07] say, "I fought a good fight." Amen. And
[1:09:09] I finished my course.
[1:09:11] Amen. Let us bow.
[1:09:14] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:09:20] Lord Jesus, we we come before you this
[1:09:23] morning. Lord,
[1:09:25] we ask that you just come down and move
[1:09:27] us out of the way, Lord. Lord, you know
[1:09:30] the hearts and the needs of your people.

[1:09:35] each and every day. And Lord, Lord, we

[1:09:48] test and trial for not. that they may
[1:09:51] turn to you and say, "Lord, I I I I want
[1:09:53] to make the right decision this morning,
[1:09:56] Lord. I I I I I want I I want to go
[1:09:59] through the test and trials that you
[1:10:00] have prepared for me, Lord. One day, I
[1:10:03] want to look up and say, Lord, that that
[1:10:05] that I I've done the right thing, that I
[1:10:09] I I fought the the right fight. I could
[1:10:12] fight many fights, but Lord, I want to
[1:10:14] fight the right fight. Lord, I want you
[1:10:16] to lead and guide my steps.
[1:10:20] If there's one this morning that said,
[1:10:21] "Lord,
[1:10:23] I I I want you to lead and guide my
[1:10:25] steps."
[1:10:27] Then I want you to to lift your hands
[1:10:29] this morning. Oh yes, Jesus. Thank you,
[1:10:32] Jesus.

[1:10:37] see all the hands that are lifted. Thank
[1:10:39] you, Jesus. Lord, you said that you can
[1:10:42] make a trial of blessing. And Lord, we
[1:10:44] ask that you touch all the hands that
[1:10:46] are lifted. Touch all the open hearts
[1:10:48] this morning. And Lord, may you do a
[1:10:51] work in the life that we all may sit
[1:10:53] back and testify that Lord that you did
[1:10:55] the work that you brought us through,
[1:10:57] Lord. That you moved in such a mighty
[1:10:59] and a strong way that we had testimony
[1:11:02] this morning of how you make trials a
[1:11:04] blessing. Lord, how you come through in
[1:11:06] ways that we didn't understand, we
[1:11:08] didn't even know. But Lord, you did the
[1:11:10] work. And Lord, we ask that you just
[1:11:12] move this morning. Lord, may you
[1:11:14] continue to work in each and every life.
[1:11:16] Lord, may you continue to bless each and
[1:11:18] every home and each and every person
[1:11:20] that's here, Lord. Each and every
[1:11:22] heart's needs and each and every heart's
[1:11:24] desires this morning. In Jesus name we
[1:11:26] pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:40] Praise God. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:44] We thank God again with the word bless,
[1:11:49] you know, I thought on this week,
[1:11:52] blessed are the pure in heart, for they
[1:11:54] shall see God. Amen. And um he was
[1:11:58] saying something in Sunday school this
[1:12:00] morning. It takes the It takes the pure
[1:12:03] and heart. It takes those that
[1:12:06] are willing to give their whole heart to
[1:12:08] God. And sometimes God tries, he
[1:12:14] searches the heart, tries to rim it. He
[1:12:17] sees whether or not we're willing to
[1:12:19] give him our heart. So sometimes
[1:12:24] God takes us through
[1:12:27] a certain way to prove what's in our
[1:12:30] heart.
[1:12:31] And so God took Israel through
[1:12:34] a way that he could see what was in
[1:12:36] their heart.
[1:12:38] And sometimes our trial and our test is
[1:12:42] to see what's in our heart. God was able
[1:12:45] to see what was in Abraham's heart. When
[1:12:48] Abraham was willing to give up the son,
[1:12:52] his only son
[1:12:55] and God looked at Job and saw what was
[1:12:59] in his heart. He said, "He's a perfect
[1:13:01] and upright man. And I know that he
[1:13:03] loves me and I know he'll serve me. I
[1:13:05] know you maintain his integrity.
[1:13:09] Sometimes God will look at us and he'll
[1:13:11] know.
[1:13:12] But
[1:13:14] Satan didn't know that.
[1:13:19] God told Satan there was nothing like
[1:13:21] him in the earth.
[1:13:23] And I I'm sure that God will look down
[1:13:25] at his bride this hour
[1:13:28] and he'll say there's none like you.
[1:13:32] There's no people on the face of the
[1:13:33] earth
[1:13:35] that will stand up against the ws of the
[1:13:37] devil
[1:13:39] that would be faithful to God
[1:13:43] in the midst of the trials and
[1:13:44] tribulations and the test.
[1:13:47] There's none like
[1:13:49] the bride of Jesus Christ. There's none
[1:13:52] like
[1:13:53] the true Christians in their heart.
[1:13:57] And I know the Satan is saying to God,
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:02] I'll make them curse you to your face.
[1:14:07] They're not serving you for nothing.
[1:14:11] Just let me go down and test them. Let
[1:14:13] me go down and try them. God, let the
[1:14:16] devil be here to test you and try you
[1:14:20] that you can come out victorious.
[1:14:23] I'm going to keep the faith of God. I'm
[1:14:26] going to hold his unchanging hand no
[1:14:29] matter what the test is.
[1:14:32] Each and every one of us have our own
[1:14:35] test and trial that we got to go
[1:14:37] through. Amen. But
[1:14:41] God will make your
[1:14:44] trial and your test a blessing
[1:14:49] if you just hold on.
[1:14:52] Something that was said
[1:14:55] that the prophet God was saying about
[1:14:58] the seed
[1:15:00] being the word.
[1:15:02] And he said the word got to fall in good
[1:15:05] ground.
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:07] and it fall in good ground.
[1:15:11] Then the seed is being watered.
[1:15:15] But faith waters the seed. Your faith
[1:15:20] waters the seed
[1:15:24] that the seed can grow.
[1:15:28] You can plant the seed. It's got to be
[1:15:30] planted in a in good ground.
[1:15:34] And you are the good ground that the
[1:15:37] seed, the word is planted in.
[1:15:41] And when that word is planted in good
[1:15:43] ground, your faith waters the seed that
[1:15:46] the seed can come forth.
[1:15:49] So brother and sister, we got to wait
[1:15:54] and let the word, Amen, accomplish that
[1:15:57] which God sent it to do. Amen.
[1:16:00] God word will grow
[1:16:02] if you just have faith and patience to
[1:16:04] wait on God. Amen. Amen. While you're
[1:16:09] going through, you got to have faith and
[1:16:11] patience. Lord, I'm waiting on you.
[1:16:13] Amen. Because it fell upon good ground.
[1:16:15] I don't care how long it takes. Amen.
[1:16:18] God, I'm going to trust your word.
[1:16:21] Your faith is water in the word. Amen.
[1:16:24] The seed. Amen. And it's got to bring
[1:16:27] forth. Amen. in his season. Amen. And
[1:16:31] those that are faithful to God and
[1:16:33] knowing that God will never fail, but
[1:16:36] God keeps his word. Amen. God will Amen.
[1:16:40] He'll show up on time. He'll do what he
[1:16:44] said he'll do. That's when your faith is
[1:16:46] worthy of water in the word. You're
[1:16:48] going to say, "God, you said, Amen, that
[1:16:51] with your stripes, I'm healed so I can
[1:16:54] hold to your word." Amen. Amen. Yes.
[1:16:57] your faith. Amen. Water in the word.
[1:17:00] Amen.
[1:17:01] That your faith says, "I'mma hold on to
[1:17:04] God." Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:07] When you going through when folks say
[1:17:09] you can't make it and you feel like you
[1:17:12] can't take it, but your faith holds on
[1:17:14] to the word.
[1:17:17] Hallelujah. Keep watering the word.
[1:17:19] Hallelujah. Praise God. Let your faith
[1:17:21] keep on saying, "God, I believe your
[1:17:23] word. God, you made me a promise." Amen.
[1:17:26] God, you and that seed shall possess the
[1:17:28] gates of his enemy. Amen. You just keep
[1:17:32] holding on
[1:17:33] [Music]
[1:17:35] and watch God show up. Amen. Aren't you
[1:17:38] glad that God showed up that day on
[1:17:41] Calvary? He showed up for you and I.
[1:17:45] Amen.
[1:17:47] He showed who was on the winning side.
[1:17:51] Amen. He showed that you're more than
[1:17:52] conquerors. Amen. Praise God. Abraham
[1:17:55] was able to see that God provided. Amen.
[1:18:00] A ram in the bush. Amen. He called that
[1:18:03] place Jehovah Gyar because the Lord
[1:18:05] would provide. I said God will provide
[1:18:08] for Abraham. He's the same God that
[1:18:10] said, "I'll provide for you."
[1:18:12] The same God today as it was yesterday.
[1:18:15] I am your provider.
[1:18:18] Praise God. And I'll make a way where
[1:18:20] there's no way. God will do it.
[1:18:24] Hallelujah. You believe that? Amen.
[1:18:27] Hallelujah.
[1:18:29] Bless
[1:18:32] God will make your trial a blessing if
[1:18:36] you just hold on. Praise God. People
[1:18:39] that have been faithful to God and they
[1:18:43] held on regardless of the circumstances
[1:18:46] that the test. Those that trusted God,
[1:18:49] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:18:53] their strength. They shall mount up with
[1:18:55] wings as an eagle. They shall run and
[1:18:58] not be
[1:19:00] weary. They should walk and not faint.
[1:19:05] Run and not they won't be weary. But you
[1:19:08] got to wait on the Lord. Amen. God bless
[1:19:11] you this. Thank God again for the word.
[1:19:14] Thank God for each and every one of you
[1:19:16] to press your way. Keep fighting the

[1:19:42] forsake me, then the Lord will take me."

[1:19:48] never leave you and never forsake you,
[1:19:50] but I'll be with you always, even until
