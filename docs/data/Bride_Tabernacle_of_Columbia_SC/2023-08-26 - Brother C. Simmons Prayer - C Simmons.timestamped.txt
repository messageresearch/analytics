[18:25] special way in Jesus name we pray amen
[18:29] amen
[18:33] tonight if you got your Bibles we'll
[18:35] turn to
[18:38] turn a real real simple thing tonight
[18:49] turn to the Book of Matthew
[18:52] Matthew chapter 6. a very familiar
[18:55] scripture
[19:12] I'm sorry everyone knows it Matthew
[19:14] chapter 6 and we'll start in verse 5.
[19:19] said when our prayers thou shall not be
[19:21] as the Hypocrites are
[19:23] for they love to pray standing in the
[19:25] synagogues in the corners of the streets
[19:27] that they may be seen of man verily I
[19:31] say unto thee they have their reward but
[19:34] thou will now pray as enter into thy
[19:37] closet and want and when thou has shut
[19:39] thy door pray to thy father which is in
[19:42] secret and thy father which see it in
[19:45] secret shall reward open reward the
[19:49] openly but when you pray use not vain
[19:52] repetitions as the heathens do
[19:54] for they think that they shall be heard
[19:57] for their much speaking be not ye
[20:01] therefore like unto them for your father
[20:03] knows what things ye have need of before
[20:06] ye ask him
[20:08] after this man are therefore pray Our
[20:11] Father which art in heaven Hallowed be
[20:14] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[20:17] done in earth as it is in heaven give us
[20:20] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[20:23] our debts as we forgive our debtors and
[20:26] lead us not into temptation but Deliver
[20:28] Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom
[20:31] and the power and the glory forever amen
[20:34] amen you may be seated tonight I'd like
[20:37] to speak on a little small topic and not
[20:39] entitled a prayer
[20:40] or also the power of Prayer and I read
[20:44] the scripture because it's it's when
[20:46] Jesus he came to Earth and he said he
[20:49] gave us instructions for how to pray he
[20:52] came down and he he said when you pray
[20:53] you should pray like this and it's
[20:55] pivotal to me that that's our
[20:58] communication with the father and that's
[21:00] the way that we communicate with God is
[21:01] to get down on our knees and to pray to
[21:04] him and when we pray to him things
[21:06] happen things can move God can do things
[21:09] but you got to talk to him you got to
[21:11] have that conversation to him and it's
[21:13] so important that we pray that it's so
[21:16] important that we remember those times
[21:18] on our knees where we got a hold of God
[21:20] and God moved and I missed God moved in
[21:23] our situation and as the songwriter said
[21:25] even when we don't see him working he's
[21:27] working even when we pray those prayers
[21:30] and we think they've forgotten God has a
[21:32] way of answering them when we need them
[21:34] he has a way of coming down and
[21:36] vindicating and surely I still heard
[21:38] those prayers I still heard what you got
[21:40] down on your knees it might have been
[21:42] years ago but I still heard what you
[21:44] asked me for and I'm gonna do exactly
[21:46] what you asked me to but it might not
[21:49] have been when you thought it was going
[21:50] to happen but it was right on time it
[21:53] was right on time it was right when God
[21:55] wanted you to have it he said I'm going
[21:57] to give it to you but he heard those
[21:59] prayers
[22:01] it's a Matthew 21-22 and he said in all
[22:06] things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer
[22:08] believe in you shall receive it see
[22:11] sometimes when you go down in prayer you
[22:13] got to believe what you're asking for
[22:14] you got to believe that lord lord I want
[22:17] you to do this and I believe that you
[22:19] are more than able to do it you're more
[22:21] than able to do what I'm asking you for
[22:23] whatever it is Lord I believe that it
[22:26] shall be done in Jesus name and you got
[22:28] to leave it at that you said it whatever
[22:30] ye shall ask in prayer believe in you
[22:33] shall receive it and Philippians it said
[22:36] four and six it said be careful for
[22:38] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[22:40] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[22:43] requests be made known unto God said
[22:45] there's some Thanksgiving sometimes you
[22:47] got to go and before you ask you got to
[22:48] thank them you need to thank God and say
[22:51] Lord I Thank you for everything that
[22:52] you've done thus far and I know that I'm
[22:55] coming with a request but Lord I got so
[22:57] much more and thank you for there's so
[22:59] much more Lord I got to get down and say
[23:01] thank you you because even though it
[23:02] might look rough it might look tough but
[23:04] Lord there's still so much I can thank
[23:06] you for you've been that good to me
[23:08] you've been that even more good to me
[23:10] and David said if I had ten thousand
[23:12] Tums I couldn't praise you enough see
[23:14] there's some Thanksgiving that has to
[23:16] happen before you ask God for things
[23:19] because God just wants you to praise him
[23:21] he wouldn't have created you if he
[23:22] didn't want you to praise him he
[23:24] wouldn't have created everything that he
[23:26] created this world and let the devil
[23:28] fall from Heaven so that he could have
[23:30] someone to praise him he said before
[23:32] with with Thanksgiving let your requests
[23:35] be made known to God
[23:37] in James 5 15 he said and the prayer of
[23:41] faith shall save the sick and the Lord
[23:43] shall raise him up and it if he have
[23:46] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[23:48] him see you have to pray with faith you
[23:51] have to pray and it said and it says in
[23:53] the Scripture it says in the prayer of
[23:56] faith shall save the sick he said when
[23:59] you have faith with prayer it shall save
[24:02] the sick so if you're sick and you have
[24:04] and you pray with faith it said it shall
[24:07] save the sick and the Lord shall raise
[24:09] him up it's not anyone that any man can
[24:11] do it's not anything that any doctor can
[24:13] do anyone that anyone can say do except
[24:16] but the Lord shall raise him up and we
[24:18] have to go with faith and Lord You're
[24:20] Going To Raise Me Up Lord you're going
[24:22] to deliver my body Lord you're going to
[24:24] deliver me out of everything that I'm
[24:26] going through every demon that's coming
[24:28] against me Lord you're going to do it
[24:29] and he said if you have committed sins
[24:32] they shall be forgiven him and it says I
[24:35] think in the word it says that he'll
[24:37] throw him into the you're forgiveness
[24:38] and remember them no more and said that
[24:43] and I wrote out I said I thought about
[24:45] something I was faced with some
[24:47] situations recently and it made me
[24:49] examine my prayer life
[24:51] and I said Lord I went to pray for
[24:54] something then I got convicted and the
[24:56] Lord came to me and said you got to be
[24:57] right before you pray
[24:59] you go down on your knees sometimes you
[25:01] wonder why God ain't moved but have you
[25:03] gotten down and you said Lord forgive me
[25:05] for anything I said I done or even
[25:07] thought that was against you Lord
[25:09] forgive me and now I can pray now I can
[25:12] give you Thanksgiving because Lord I
[25:13] want to be right before you that you can
[25:15] hear my prayers Lord I want to be right
[25:17] before you that Lord I know that you're
[25:19] hearing what I say even though I mean I
[25:22] see that like you're moving but I know
[25:24] that you're moving because that's what
[25:25] you said you would do
[25:27] and Proverbs 15 29 he said the Lord is
[25:31] far from the wicked but he hears the
[25:33] prayers of the righteous the Lord May if
[25:36] you're doing things that are not right
[25:38] then it may not seem like God is moving
[25:40] in your life even when you're praying it
[25:43] may not see but you know I something a
[25:45] song that somebody prayed for me
[25:46] sometimes you don't know what God has
[25:49] protected you from because somebody was
[25:51] praying for you you don't know what God
[25:53] has kept you from because somebody was
[25:55] praying for you somebody was on their
[25:58] knees the Lord sent them and woke them
[26:00] up in the middle of the night and said
[26:01] pray for them pray for this one pray for
[26:03] that one because they need prayer they
[26:06] can't even intercede for themselves but
[26:08] Lord I'm going to intercede for them
[26:10] that Lord you bring them out Lord that
[26:12] you deliver them Lord that you take care
[26:13] of them Lord that you keep them from all
[26:16] harm keep them from those evil spirits
[26:18] that's coming against them Lord keep
[26:20] them from anything that may not be not
[26:22] like you it said in Proverbs 15 8 the
[26:25] the sacrifice of the wicked isn't an
[26:28] Abomination to the Lord but the prayers
[26:30] of the upright is his Delight the
[26:33] prayers of the upright is his Delight
[26:34] said that you got to be right with God
[26:37] when you go to pray when you expect God
[26:39] to move you want to be right with them
[26:41] you want to make sure that all channels
[26:43] are clear and said many times some
[26:45] people don't get it right to the end of
[26:47] the road but you got an opportunity each
[26:49] and every day to get it right you got an
[26:51] opportunity to every day that you have
[26:53] breath in your body say Lord I want to
[26:55] live closer and closer to you Lord I
[26:57] want to live closer and closer for you
[26:59] Lord I want to grow in in you and Lord I
[27:01] want you to do exceedingly and
[27:03] abundantly in my life
[27:05] in James 5 and 16 it said confess your
[27:08] faults one to another and pray for one
[27:11] another that you may be healed some
[27:13] people wonder why they aren't healed and
[27:16] they haven't confessed what they have in
[27:17] them you can't move past that until you
[27:20] that's a scripture that's not anything
[27:22] that we said but that's in the scripture
[27:24] in James 5 and 16 it says confess your
[27:27] faults one to another and pray one for
[27:30] another that you may be healed the
[27:32] affection fervent prayer of the
[27:33] righteous man Avail as much she is you
[27:37] have to confess things sometimes you got
[27:39] to come and you if you got all against
[27:41] your brother your sister you got to come
[27:42] and confess to him and say brother
[27:44] forgive me sister forgive me
[27:46] Pastor forgive me anyone that you that
[27:49] you may feel that that you may feel
[27:52] against you have to come and confess it
[27:54] and get it right and then pray and then
[27:57] pray that you may be healed said in
[28:00] Ephesians said praying always with all
[28:03] prayer and supplication and spirit
[28:04] watching therefore unto all perseverance
[28:07] and supplication for All Saints in first
[28:09] Thessalonians 5 17 and said pray without
[28:11] ceasing
[28:13] so so God wanted to put that in the
[28:16] scripture if it wasn't important
[28:18] he wouldn't have put it there it was
[28:20] only three three words pray without
[28:23] ceasing it was but it was pivotal
[28:25] because with everything in life you need
[28:27] to have constant communication with God
[28:29] everything that you do you should be
[28:32] asking Lord should I do this Lord should
[28:34] I go here Lord should I conversate with
[28:37] these people Lord Lord God my tongue God
[28:40] my speech Lord Lord that I might not say
[28:42] something that's against you Lord that I
[28:45] may that I might be a light for you
[28:47] because whether you like it or not
[28:48] people are watching people are watching
[28:51] what you say people are watching how you
[28:53] react and sometimes the devil will send
[28:56] a test so that he so that you can react
[28:58] and to be to be so that your testimony
[29:01] may not be as impactful as it is because
[29:05] people are watching you they may not be
[29:08] watching a person that says something to
[29:09] you but they watching How You Gonna
[29:11] react and sometimes you got to pray and
[29:13] say Lord Keep Me Lord keep me from
[29:16] what's coming against me because I can't
[29:18] keep myself Lord watch over me and let
[29:21] no put a hedge around me that's what the
[29:23] devil said Lord I can't touch job
[29:25] because you gotta hedge around them but
[29:27] lift that hedge but God knew what was in
[29:30] job God knew that you know what no
[29:32] matter what I give Joe as long as you
[29:35] don't take his life he's not going to
[29:37] deny me not once he's not going to come
[29:40] against me once he's always going to
[29:42] stick with me because God knew what was
[29:44] in job
[29:45] just imagine how strong job had to be
[29:48] with his prayers
[29:50] when everyone comes against him even his
[29:52] own wife came against him the only one
[29:54] that he could talk to was God the only
[29:57] one that he could go to and confide in
[29:59] was God his body's feeling him his
[30:02] friends have failed him his wife has
[30:04] failed him his children have been killed
[30:06] they're gone all his wealth is gone who
[30:08] else does he have to turn to
[30:10] but God then I I wonder if job was
[30:14] praying all the time I guess he had to
[30:16] he didn't have no one else to turn to he
[30:19] didn't have no one else but God knew
[30:21] that when he didn't have no one else he
[30:23] still would turn to him he wouldn't
[30:24] forget what God had already done to him
[30:27] and if God could do that he could do
[30:28] more than he ever could expect
[30:31] and I I wrote down something I said
[30:33] sometimes you gotta ask for what you
[30:35] want
[30:36] you got to go to God and you gotta come
[30:38] with the right Spirit when you go to God
[30:40] you got to come with the right attitude
[30:42] when you go to God but once you come
[30:44] with the right attitude and the right
[30:45] Spirit then you can ask for things in
[30:48] Mark 7 and 7 he said ask and it shall be
[30:50] given seek and ye shall find knock and
[30:53] it shall be open unto you so all you
[30:56] have to do is ask sometimes
[31:00] I think in James it says you have not
[31:02] because you ask not and when you ask you
[31:05] ask a Miss that's what James said you
[31:07] have not because you asked not and you
[31:09] ask sometimes like why don't I have this
[31:12] why don't I have that it's maybe because
[31:15] you ain't asked for it maybe because you
[31:17] you you got to there and the Lord was
[31:19] waiting on you to ask for more and you
[31:21] said I'm satisfied with what I have I'm
[31:24] satisfied with what I have Lord but but
[31:27] David said Lord I want my cup to run
[31:30] over
[31:31] Lord I wanted to overflow I wanted to
[31:34] overflow I don't want to just be filled
[31:36] I wanted to be spilling over sometimes
[31:39] you know I I've seen this in my own life
[31:41] sometimes you look around you say Lord
[31:43] why is everyone else being blessed
[31:45] around me
[31:47] and sometimes you look and you say you
[31:49] know what
[31:50] maybe the Lord is Blessing them because
[31:52] of me being in this place
[31:55] because I pray every day Lord bless them
[31:58] and bless this bless where I am bless my
[32:01] child bless and bless my co-workers Lord
[32:03] and I'm and they're receiving some of
[32:06] the blessings that God is pouring on
[32:08] your life and you wonder why man I can't
[32:11] understand this but God is doing the
[32:13] work it's not what you do it's not
[32:16] anything that you do you said Lord I
[32:17] Surrender everything the Lord I just
[32:19] want to be a willing vessel Lord I want
[32:22] you to fill me up and continue to fill
[32:24] me up Lord that I make my cup May
[32:26] overflow now others may feel your
[32:28] presence now Others May know that you
[32:30] are God that you are the one and the
[32:32] true God and there's nothing that I may
[32:34] say or do but they know that you are
[32:36] real
[32:37] to sometimes people when you when you
[32:40] start getting getting into that prayer
[32:42] people will come to you and ask you to
[32:44] pray
[32:45] because they know that God is moving on
[32:47] your prayers they'll come to you you
[32:49] made the stranger the person that don't
[32:51] like you or say they'll go through
[32:52] something and they'll come and they say
[32:54] hey can you pray for my family can you
[32:56] pray for this situation and you said
[32:58] they don't even like me they might have
[33:00] spoke things against me but they'll come
[33:01] to you because they know that when you
[33:03] pray things happen things change and
[33:06] that's the that's the god that we serve
[33:08] that he can change it
[33:11] in John 14 and 14 say if you shall ask
[33:15] anything in my name I will do it
[33:18] it's just that simple sometimes when you
[33:20] go to God and pray you got to believe
[33:22] that God is able and willing to answer
[33:25] what you ask him for you got to believe
[33:27] that God will do everything that he can
[33:29] what that he said he would do if it's
[33:32] not contrary to his word then you got to
[33:34] believe that God can do it you got to
[33:36] believe the Lord when I get down on my
[33:38] knees said that when the weakest
[33:40] Christian get down on they need is to
[33:42] pray all the devil's Shake because they
[33:45] know there's power in that prayer they
[33:47] know there's there's power in the
[33:49] prayers when they when you get down to
[33:52] pray
[33:53] and I was reading something and it
[33:55] touched me and said
[33:56] now there are some things in the Bible
[33:58] this Prophet God said he said there's
[34:01] some things in the Bible that God wants
[34:03] us
[34:04] wants us to challenge and God is an
[34:07] all-powerful God and he gives his
[34:09] servants a commission to do great things
[34:11] and we mustn't be afraid to ask God to
[34:15] do great things
[34:17] so we mustn't be afraid to ask God to do
[34:19] great things because he's asked us to do
[34:22] the impossible without him so if he's
[34:25] asked us to do the impossible we want to
[34:28] have the I'm nipping
[34:30] um omnipotent God to do those
[34:33] Impossibles he said go ye into all the
[34:36] world and preach the gospel to Every
[34:37] Creature these signs shall follow them
[34:39] that believe the impossible with man
[34:43] that's impossible with man and we
[34:46] mustn't be afraid to ask God to keep his
[34:49] word
[34:50] said we mustn't be afraid to ask God to
[34:54] keep his word so if God said it in his
[34:57] word then it shall be done he said no
[35:00] word can return to me boy so if you ask
[35:02] him and it's in his word then they can't
[35:04] turn return to him or so you believe
[35:07] that it's going to happen you believe
[35:09] that no matter how long it takes it's
[35:11] going to happen if you believe and God
[35:13] said I shall deliver that you believe
[35:15] that it's going to happen and it shall
[35:17] happen because that's in his word if you
[35:19] believe if you say that Lord you said
[35:21] you would heal then you got to believe
[35:23] that it's going to happen because it's
[35:24] in his words he said by his strength we
[35:27] are healed yes anything that's in his
[35:29] word you mustn't be afraid to ask God to
[35:32] keep his word because it's his word it's
[35:35] his word and he gave it and he said it
[35:38] can't return to me boy said when you get
[35:40] down to pray you said you want to defeat
[35:42] the Devil you use the word you don't use
[35:45] anything else you turned here and you
[35:46] said Lord in his word that's how Jesus
[35:49] defeated them and that's how we're
[35:50] supposed to defeat him I can't be afraid
[35:53] to ask God to keep his word I can't be
[35:56] afraid to ask God to do what he already
[35:58] said he would do he said he would bless
[36:01] me I can't be afraid of the blessings of
[36:03] God and I can't be afraid of the healing
[36:05] I can't be afraid of the Deliverance of
[36:08] God because he's God there's no one
[36:10] greater than him he said I own the
[36:12] cattle on a thousand hills and he can
[36:14] give it to you he's a God that can
[36:16] change things he's the god that can
[36:19] deliver he's a God that can set free
[36:21] he's a god that is above all names he's
[36:24] Jesus and there's no one that's higher
[36:26] than him said you can't you mustn't be
[36:29] afraid to ask God to keep his word see
[36:33] that's what prayer can do
[36:35] prayer it can move mountains it can cast
[36:38] things into the sea he said what you
[36:40] bound on Earth our bind in heaven and
[36:42] what you're loose on Earth are loose in
[36:44] heaven so you need some things bound up
[36:46] you get down on your knees and you say
[36:48] Lord I need you to bind this up Lord I
[36:51] need you to move in this Lord I need you
[36:53] to take control because Lord that's what
[36:55] I need you to do Lord I'm coming to you
[36:57] and Lord this is in your word Lord you
[37:00] move you do what you said you would do
[37:02] it's in your word and it can't return it
[37:04] to your voice yes when you go to him
[37:06] with the right Spirit God can do
[37:09] exceedingly and abundantly more than you
[37:11] can ever ask for a thing because that's
[37:13] the god that we serve amen
[37:22] [Applause]
[37:31] it's all right to praise God Amen
[37:34] it's all right to tell the Lord thank
[37:36] you

[37:39] it's all right to ask God
[37:42] to keep his word
[37:44] this ain't something somebody else
[37:45] promised us but God in heaven he heard
[37:48] Hallelujah and he made the promise
[37:51] didn't he it's all right to ask God to
[37:53] keep his word he said if you believe on
[37:56] the Lord hallelujah then thou in thy
[37:59] house ain't that what he said come on

[39:26] you know God brings us to certain trials
[39:29] and tribulations situations he never
[39:32] left us
[39:33] he was all he's still there the whole
[39:35] time
[39:36] he let everybody fail you
[39:39] so our brother was preaching tonight I
[39:41] was just meditating I said sometimes you
[39:45] you come to a place especially early in
[39:48] the Christian journey and you feel like
[39:50] you're all alone
[39:52] and nobody's there I said but in that
[39:54] time
[39:55] that's when I found God
[39:58] in that quiet place
[40:01] when I had nobody else to talk to
[40:04] I found God in that place you know how
[40:07] because I was on my knees
[40:10] talking to God all about it
[40:13] calling on the name of Jesus that's
[40:15] where that relationship was built
[40:18] and that's the way God in those times
[40:20] those in those prayer Clauses those
[40:24] coming out to the church sometimes all
[40:26] night being by yourself
[40:29] but in those times that's when that
[40:31] relationship was formed
[40:33] that's when that Bond was formed and he
[40:36] let he let you know early in your
[40:37] Christian Journey that I'll never leave
[40:40] you nor forsake you
[40:41] he let you know early then you can trust
[40:44] in me
[40:45] when everybody else is gone I'll still
[40:48] be here
[40:49] it was in those times
[40:52] that you forged that relationship
[40:55] but it wasn't in the mass crowds it was
[40:58] somewhere in the steel steel place
[41:01] down on your knees in prayer
[41:03] I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna
[41:05] sit down because I believe God he don't
[41:08] say what he wanted to say tonight
[41:10] but
[41:11] I was thinking
[41:13] I was telling my wife and I know
[41:15] somebody else I was saying you know
[41:17] in certain situations only prayer gonna
[41:20] help
[41:22] we don't talk we don't try
[41:26] it ain't doing no good it ain't did no
[41:28] good
[41:30] that's all we're going to do is pray
[41:32] because in certain situations only
[41:34] prayer will do amen
