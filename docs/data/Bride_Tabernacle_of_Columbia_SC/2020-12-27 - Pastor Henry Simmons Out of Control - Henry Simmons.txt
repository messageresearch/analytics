chapter ii peter the third chapter as we dwell on just what is the future the future 2021 as we embark upon a new year the future here peter says in the second peter the third chapter this second epistle beloved are now writing to you in both which i stir up your pure mind by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the prophet holy prophet and of the commandments of us the apostle of the lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continued as they were from the beginning of creation for this they are willingly ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being over flood with water perish but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved into fire against the day of judgment and prediction of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is what the lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the lord is not slight concerning his promises that some men do count slightly but is long suffering to us for not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with the great noise and the elements shall melt with the fervent heat the earth also in the works that are there in shall be burnt up sin then that all these things shall be dissolved what amount of person ought you to be in all holy conversation in godliness looking for and hasting until the coming of the day of god when the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heaven and a new earth when dwelleth righteousness wherefore my beloved sin that you look for such thing be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given him has written unto you may god bless you with his word you may be seated again we thank the lord we thank god for our sister there we're glad to have you this morning and we just appreciate everyone again the pressure way god is good amen the future let's um have a you know just a preview of what we've been through in a little bit of uh 2020 as we embark upon 2021 out of control we said things are out of control amen as we look at the fires the wildfires that have hit the that have hit america next oh okay the pandemic and what is its cause then we had the social injustice and all of that hurricanes so many it's never before well by the grace of god we had so many things that have transpired in 2020 that things just spare it out of control so much now man is trying to recover from 2020. we're in the recovering phase but is there really a recovery when i said the future what's in store for 2021 is it more of the same or is there recovery can president-elect biden in his cabinet that he's put together can they cause a recovery sin the pandemic and the wildfires and the hurricanes and all the disasters that have hit america not only in america but hit the whole world how do we recover from it so i thought about i said hopefully we won't be here to speak on the new years that's coming in how do we prepare ourselves for 2021 how do we prepare ourselves for 2021 [Music] how do we prepare ourselves for 2021 it's a lot that is going on i thought it's fitting that ii peter third chapter he said this second episcopal love are not right unto you and by which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance the bible states that evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse we realize that the world is saying this global warming and different things my wife was just telling me they say we're in store for more pandemics we're in store for how can we control the global warming and all of these things that are happening that's causing all of these things to befall us and they said except we attack except we deal with the main issues of what's causing the effect now scientific world is looking at what what's causing all of this we know that man because of greed he'll contaminate the waters to try to pull the resources the oil and the gold the diamonds and everything out of the earth and you know what if we stop pulling the coal the different things out of the earth that it's going to weaken the earth we know if we start drilling the oil and stuff in the oceans and all that it's going to contaminate the ocean so everything is being and it's going so far now so i think the things are out of control when it comes down to the social life i believe the world is saying everything is goes everything goes they said black lives matter but they said all lives matter so we're not going to get into the political arena but we realize that everything is being dealt with and man is facing the fact that how do we get it in control seeing that everything is falling apart the world is falling apart how do we get it back together how can we recover [Music] or to help us get things back together but peter's saying here he says knowing this first that that should come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming people in our age in this dispensation this period of time do not want to face the fact that the coming of the lord is drawing now the disciples they were more in contact they told jesus jesus when should these things be and what shall be the sign of that coming in the end of the world they wanted to know because they knew that it was going to come a time that the world would come to his end and i'm saying to you and i sir just the time of the end have we come as far as we can go this 2021 the end of the world brother and sister we need to recognize that what are you and i going to prepare ourselves for they're talking about a a another strand of this virus and so when they get through with this one will it be a next one and how do we deal with it would there be more hurricanes next year how can we deal with the brother sister how do we prepare ourselves it's look it looks pretty damn it looks pretty dark outside the future don't look good to nobody young people are giving up on the future they're trying to live it up now the jobs are saying there's no future in your job people used to look forward to something but now what do we look forward to brother and sister let us not fool ourselves the bible says here in second timothy 3. the bible talks about the day of the lord part about i was in the days of noah sometimes folks keep eating drinking and marrying and giving in marriage and keep on sinning and thank god just going to stand back and get a live man just to do anything he's big enough and bad enough to do and god just going to stand back and just let him keep on doing it prophet god says that the man called the flood on himself and if man calls the flood man can cause the battle i'm looking in the bombs and all the fire to cause it to come on itself not that god sanded fire man cause the bombs to be all of this that they've invented and all of this thing these things that they've caused to come to pass then it caused amen the earth began to burn like an oven what happens god just allowed man to destroy himself [Music] but instead of trying to make things better every time they try to better themselves they make it worse they're not satisfied with the way god has made it we know that this god made a garden of eden and he saw that everything was wonderful lovely but the devil got in the midst of it and the devil since that time amen he's tried to make a better world to sin in a world that man could have pleasure and sin you're trying to make it comfortable to sin the laws are being passed to make it comfortable to do what god said not to do hey we got a right to sin we want to put it on the book that is all right to have pleasure in that which god said is abomination in his sight but man is making it so comfortable and think he's going to get away with it not knowing that the day of reckoning coming that judgment amen going to come one day and everyone no matter what you're doing you got to stand and face god and you got to be accountable to the word of god preachers that are afraid to preach the truth to the people one day they're gonna have to face the fact amen that they fail to tell the people the truth praise god when we made it a cabinet amen where we got everything goes well wow where everything is all right amen we don't feel condemned from amen the things amen that are sinful [Music] the bible said that conscience reached it with a heart iron amen because they didn't learn to love the truth god gave them over to reprobate minds we've come to a place that reprobation have set in people have gone so far to they don't feel condemned when they're wrong anymore sometimes we we want to make folk comfortable in sin we don't want them to feel condemned when they're in sin amen do what you big and bad enough to do amen as long as amen it's your own thing do what you want to do with it amen but the bible said to the church we're bound with the price we're not on amen your body is the temple of the holy ghost oh yes amen you're gonna have to give a count whatever man so that shall he also read what day are you gonna be amen you're gonna stand before god and the book is gonna be open praise god it won't be amen the supreme court of america neither would it be amen the world cult whether it be god himself will be the church of the quicken the dead amen god gonna hold you accountable amen so one day you're going to stand before the judgment seat of christ and you must give an answer sometimes we want to brush it past what does 2021 hold can we stand more pandemics can we stand amen the more amen of what we've been through in 2020 can we take in any more of this restaurant amen they're going out of business amen the jobs they meant folks that are losing their jobs social life amen is not what it used to be but god is still telling you amen spent some time with me the community means socialize with me what this 2021 holds how can we prepare for 2021 you need to take time to get on your knees and commune with god and to god what will you help me to do in 2021 lord i want to know your will your purpose for my life oh lord yes lord i want to know what you would have me to do oh yes brothers and sisters time out praise god one day god's going to require you amen the gift and the talent that he's given you god's going to require of you one day amen the life that he gave amen the light that he gave you he said what do you do with the light that i gave you hallelujah you said i i i i gave it all to the devil you gave me the life but i thought it away amen god gives us life help and strength and we won't praise him we won't tell him thank you i thought about the future what does the future hold in 2021 and i said one thing about it amen i want to thank the law amen if this was uh it meant uh thursday night i would say thank you jesus thank you for taking me through the pandemic thank you for taking me through and keeping me lord so many have died so many are sick so many oh god i can't praise you right now the lord why i can i want to say thank you thank you jesus i got another chance to praise you amen what are the future oh more praises for me i want to thank you more than i ever hey god oh i want to oh hallelujah i want to lift his name up i want to serve god's purpose amen amen i want the will of god to be done in my life 20 21 amen i want to be able to teach somebody about jesus tell them about the love of god got them to this change tell him that he healed him that he can do it for you hallelujah i want to do more for jesus in 2021 amen praise god hallelujah lord i go amen i'll go where you want me to go it might look a little difficult a little amen are hard to go amen well amen god will send you but lord if you send me i'll go i'll do what you want done amen sometimes you have to leave home to do what god said sometimes you have to leave family to do what god's saying sometimes you have to leave friends to do what god say but i'll do 20 21 amen you might lose friends you might lose family members amen you might lose the one you think amen that you love so much amen but you might have to walk away from it all remember because you got to be led by the spirit of the lord and have you led by the spirit hallelujah everything will be all right thank you jesus hallelujah it's time to get about your father's business it's trouble times out there amen praise god the bible says amen they said where's the promise of it's coming they meant they thought he was coming in 88 they thought he was coming in 2000. they meant somebody said he was coming amen in 2020 or whatever amen did it seem like but what is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continued as a word they met as many amen men of god that are left off the scene in 2020. praise god just coming from my brother-in-law bishop they meant roseanne funeral the other day they met praise god my brother lying sick amen praise god pastor simmons they meant for god amen it's still good amen but god is still good he's good to us oh yes it hurts oh yes we'll travel on the other hand but god is good amen he's able to heal and comfort them that moan in zion hallelujah knowing oh god to the future your future brother sister amen he said nevertheless we according to this promise look for a new heaven a new earth way and dwell in the righteousness amen there's no righteousness here amen i don't care how much social justice they're crying now there's no righteous here we might as well forget about it praise god the only righteous one is god himself the bible said he was made sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of god we want our own righteousness amen that's why paul said my heart designed prayer to god for israel then they might be saved saying that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of god's righteousness going about to establish their own righteousness amen they're going about to establish their own righteousness amen there's a way to seem right to a man but the end of is the way of death amen let's not go with the way that seems right amen i'ma tell you brothers and sisters time to take a stand amen are you with me this morning i say in 2021 will you stand with me brother will you stand with me sister i said time for you to stand up for jesus it's time for you to know the will of god for your life it's time for you to take a stand praise god if you have to stand by yourself amen praise god god i ever understand by myself it might be lonely but you said i never leave you neither will i forsake you if god be with you amen if god before you who can be against you amen if you got god amen you got a whole multitude with you praise god you got a whole army with you have you got god amen sometimes we worry about amen standing by ourselves elijah said lord lord i'm standing here by myself and god said i got seven thousand to have not buy the bill amen god got others that standing in the gut that makes up their heads they've got others that are crying and sign because the abomination done in the city god got others amen that you may not be able to see you might think you're by yourself but god got somebody standing standing for righteousness i said stand for righteousness stand o god amen all hell is going to be against you every devil out of the pits of the hell is going to come up against you amen but you got to take a stand for god i believe the demon powers and the devil amen is upset with those that are standing amen for righteousness and those that are standing for holiness and those that want to live a godly life i believe amen that you've been persecuted amen and i believe that some folk even that go to church they don't like you because you're trying to do the best you can to live the life for god amen praise god preachers and pastors don't like you ain't meant because you're trying to stand up for god they look at you like something wrong with you amen when you're not playing the games the other folks are playing hallelujah amen sometimes you look like amen am i standing by myself am i the only amen young folks stand up for jesus amen stand for jesus oh hallelujah not every young lady they ain't meant all to lose amen herself in the falling in the filth of the world not every young man ought to get involved they meant to try to play the kings of the world got to be somebody that's holy there's got to be somebody that's going to stand in this last day amen and stand up for god amen he said it was possible i said you to see the very lake and i'll tell you the devil is bringing deception upon the world amen and deception is setting in and man is going to do everything he can do to try to make it better and all that he does if god is not in the forefront it's only going to get worse and you think that they're going to put god in the forefront will god be the head of this social society that they're trying to bring into being is god going to be ahead of this government that they're trying to amen bring in the power in this last day will god be the center force of will that be the antichrist amen will that be somebody that's against the word of god amen if god was in it then they would not try to make it amen where god condemns it are you with me so man is getting together of force amen to be acceptable and they say conclu see oh that big word that you use they're making everything way to be accepted are you going to fall for it or you're going to take a stand in the school house on this job they're saying if you don't then you're doing a hate crime so we're being pressured into a place that society is trying to push us into they're trying to push us into a place where sin is going to reign and ungodliness and perversion is gonna be all right but i'm saying to you tonight i mean today this morning let god have preeminence in your life if you want things to get better i want you to look to god i want you to live a life i i said this second i said i was gonna do that knowing this that in the last days perilous times dangerous times are gonna come for men should be lovers of their own self are we here are we there lovers of their own self the only way folks love you is you put up with their filth but if you stand against it they say you hate them you don't hate them you hate what they're doing you don't hate them you hate the way they're living you hate sin you love them and praise god but they want to say because you don't love what they're doing that you don't love them are you with me you love the sinner but you hate the sin are you with me it says lovers of their own selves covers this boasters proud we got gay pride they proud to be what they are are you with me and you better not say nothing against you all of our families all over our homes everybody preachers are scared if you say anything we're living in a society that they're gonna shut us up those that bold enough to speak out against and call it sin they don't want you to call nothing sin they don't want you to call it it's all right god love everybody but god don't love sin again god loves the sinner but he hates the sin okay proud blasphemers disobedient to parents are we there we there do we have obedient children children would be disobedient but society exalt the child over the parents we're living in a world where his children are their oppressors and are you with me child got my right than the parent guy are you with me and they know it if you look at them hard they say i'm gonna tell on you and you know who they're gonna believe they gonna believe that child before they believe their parents we're living in a dangerous time you can't correct correction if we did not take correction god don't deal with us as sons i don't want to say that word but you know what god did with your ass okay people can't stand you to say certain words now if you say hell fire you to get oh no i might have a panic attack are you a man would you nevertheless that's what they're ahead if they don't do right okay it says blasphemers disobedient parents unthankful unholy we'll tell you something people have made unholy felt garbage holy some of the most unholy things people have made it holy you ought to see what the people say the holy ghost is they got nightclub in church and praise dancers like striptease and they're saying it's holy holy dancing little girls slinging their bodies around dancing in the church like god is accepting it brother and sister is that holy dancing is that a holy god that would allow certain things if it was 75 years ago when you're going to holiness church and do some of the stuff that holiness peoples do today you asking us to accept this is being holy now if it wasn't holy 75 years ago what makes it holy now have holiness lost its meaning you don't have to say male nor female you can say others are what what's up they got a whole nother language out there you ain't got to be called male not female you can be called what is that word they see what i'm saying we've gone too far language has lost the language that's lost its meaning we've gone so far to we don't even know how what to say old preachers don't have an idea of what to say because you if you say this they said that's wrong you said that but you got to say what the bible says isn't that right you can't add to it you can't take away are y'all with me if you say what the word say then god will back you up you say well man say the devil will back you up who you want to back you up god or the devil are you with me it says unthankful and holy without natural affection i'm telling you you have to pray and see what's natural and what's unnatural see because the natural and unnatural to these young people almost lost the reality they think it's natural to walk down the street what used to be pantyhose underneath garment oh y'all whoop me ain't ashamed to walk down the street and forgot your dress oh you're with me don't say nothing about it because they didn't forget the dream that used to be the underneath clothes but now it's acceptable as being your odd appearance are you with me and they don't want the old preachers to say nothing about it because this is new things are changing but god's word don't change are you look man if the preachers were standing the pulpit and telling people the truth things would be better are you with me truth breakers false accusers incontinence fears despising of those that are what i'm gonna tell you something you got a lot of folks hate you because you try to do the right thing i'm gonna tell you the world will draw you the devil will pull at you here pressure you god said whosoever will let him come with love and kindness he'll draw us the world will put pressure on you if you're not doing what the world wants you to do he'll keep pressuring your oppression you're pulling on you but god said whosoever will let him come take up the water of life freely anytime you feel pressured into a thing stay away from it because if it's god it'll be a love affair you don't want to serve god because you're afraid of him you want to serve him because you love him are you with me so we want to love god more than more and more in 2021 that we get ready to meet god as a world is preparing and trying to recover by increasing sin and doing more wickedness than they ever practice in history of the world as they're increasing their wickedness and try to recover the economy and try to recap the global warming and all of these things but they'll have no solution and no dealing with sin as i said if america would have did like joan nineman when jonah went to the netherlands then will repent if america would get on their knees in the white house and everywhere in america in the state house if they get on their knees and say we repent we are sinners lord we're going so far away from you god we want to bring think we can do that you think that we can do that no if the world itself could get on their knees is that god we repent we'll lord we've gone away from your word lord forgive us can the world do that no let's come back home brother sister we've gone as far as we can go but you and i let's get ready to get out of here let's get ready to go home better
