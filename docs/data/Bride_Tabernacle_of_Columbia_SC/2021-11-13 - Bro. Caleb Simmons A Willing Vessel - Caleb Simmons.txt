and have your way in jesus name we pray amen amen at this time we go to the book of first first samuel chapter 17. you been first samuel chapter 17 when you got it say amen amen and verse 32 that's what we started first samuel chapter 17 verse 32. and david said to saul let no man heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine and saul said to david thou are not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou a butter youth and he a man of war from his youth and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father sheep and there came a lion in a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and salute him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he would deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee amen god had a blessing to the reason that's where you may be seeing amen amen i'd like to speak on a small topic of a willing vessel a willing vessel if you read in the scripture here you see how david he came this he had went to the story before the if you read before in the chapter he went to go see his brothers davis went to go see his brothers they were in the camp of saul and the philistines have brought their most most valuable weapon in goliath fourth and goliath challenged the army of the of the israel and said if y'all can bring one person to defeat me then we'll all we all surrender and come to your side and david and no one everyone was afraid because july goliath was a giant he was so many feet high and he he was a soldier from his youth that saul said here and he said and david came to bring food to his brothers his dad sent him and he said and he said i'll fight him and saul looked at him and said you can't fight him he's been training since he was a youth and david said well i fought the lion and i fought the bear and i got victory over both of them and and saul said go forth the lord be with you and david at this point in time david had some things that he had victory over he had some victories some small things that the lord had brought him through and and stepped forward and he said i'm willing to go i'm willing to fight because i know that the lord is with me i know that the things that god has brought me through is going to carry forward and the things that he's going to do for me so i'm not afraid because he was a willing vessel he said lord you send me i'll go lord use me i'll go because i know that what you brought me through is just showing me what you can do it's just showing me what you're able to do and where you're able to take me it doesn't take much it just takes one person being a willing vessel it just takes one person saying lord use me send me i'll go and god can do exploits he can do mighty wondrous works um you look through history and you see um seymour he was on azusa street and he was praying lord send a revival he wanted a revival he he got down and he he dedicated his life to a move of god he dedicated his life and he became that willing vessel and it started a movement called the azusa street revival where it and it caught fire and it touched so many people and he was able to see the effects of one man's dedication one man has taken the time out to get close to god one man saying that this is not enough i need to do more this is not enough i need to do more i need to pray more i need to seek his face more and that's all he did he became that willing vessel he became the one that he said lord use me lord send me and i'll go and lord and i just taken a small step taking something very small but god can do something so great with it god can take the smallest of vessels and say that's the one i'm going to use like they like you look at david david had many other brothers that were taller and statue that were bigger stronger and samuel when he went to the lord since samuel down to david's father's house to anoint him king he brought all his sons sons before him except for david and everyone that passed before samuel was like i know that's the one i know that's the one and the lord said no the lord said no the lord said no and then they even forgot david was out in the field tending the sheep they forgot he was out there but after all samuel said is there any you have any more sons and they say yeah you got the one out there in the field 10 in the sheep and samuel said call for him and bring him forward and he brought him forward in the and samuel anointed him to be the king it was the one that no one thought was going to be the one to be successful no one thought that he was going to be king he didn't look like the king he didn't act like the king but he was the one that god wanted he was the one that was going to shine the light for and lead the people forward in the victory it wasn't everyone it wasn't the one that everyone was looking forward to and saying that's the one or that looks like the one but it was the one that god had pre-ordained and said that's the that's my chosen vessel that's the one that's the one that's going to be a willing vessel that's going to take heed to my to my word and take heed to what i want him to do and he's going to listen and he's going to follow and a willing vessel tonight amen you see in the bible you look at the story of esther now through the story of esther you see how god was preparing her to be the to for the role that she was going to play he was preparing her since he was a child he could have chose any other person to be esther but he chose that one person who uncle's name was motorcyc he could have chose any other young lady to do to do that work but he chose esther it wasn't someone that everyone else would have said that's the one that's the one right there but god said this is the one that's going to listen and heed and be a willing vessel to me and do what i want her to do and to show forth that it doesn't take the biggest strongest person it just takes the one that's that's able to be willing to to lean to his understanding not my understanding to lean to what he wants me to do not what i want to do lord i just want to sacrifice and give you back to you what what you gave to me you look at even jesus which was god's son on earth and you look at how he came and he said lord if this cup can pass then let it pass but at the end of the day he became a willing vessel and he said not my will be done but that will be done and said lord i just want to be a willing vessel something that you can use something that's empty when god he said you can't fill up a cup that's already got water in it you got to have an empty cup to put to fill it up totally up so what you want to be an empty vessel a willing and an empty vessel says sometimes it takes small steps jesus just wants you to take small steps and he can he can reach you and pull you the rest of the way he he can take a small sacrifice that you give and he can make that a great thing because he can magnify it and glorify it i said when you take a small step with jesus he'll take you further than you ever thought you could go when you take a small step with jesus he'll take you further than you ever thought you could go so just giving your life to him even though it may seem small can be something that proves to be something great it can move you across and put you in position in places that you never thought you could have been you never thought you would have been but god god is able to do exceedingly abundantly all that we ask or think so just taking a small thing and god able to multiply and magnify it you never know who god is going to use to be there it could be one one of the children it could be one of us that said lord i want to be a willing vessel it don't take the grown folks to to be the one to lead god can use whoever he wants to use so you're not too small too young or too great or too high that god can't use you god always uses those that are willing that are able say taking that small step with jesus can leave you can take you further than you all ever thought you could go and sometimes we we look at problems and we want the solution without going through the process we want this answer to the problem without going through the process we we want to take the problem and say and just shortcut it and get me to the answer but not realizing that if we would go through the process god will be building us and creating us and using us and washing out and cleaning out that vessel so it can be used he can take the steps the many steps that we thought that we could skip but god said no you need to go through this to make you who who he wants us to be so that he can use us so everything that you go through is just a testament of what god can bring you through everything that you experience is just a testament of what god can do for you everything that you you experience everything that every trial and tribulation it's just proof of how much more god can do for you so if he done it for you yesterday don't think that he gonna mistake and not do it for you tomorrow because he's so good and so gracious he said i'm the same yesterday today and forever and i change not so if he's that god he can always fill up the vessel again and say to his to his glory and say i'm going to use this vessel because now you're clean now you done sacrificed it now yet i've been through some things so you understand the vessel might have some cracks and god said i'm gonna mold it and and clean up the broken pieces and i'm gonna put it back together a willing vessel even if it's broken and shattered when you got the master potter that can reshape and remold and can bring it all together again and say lord i know that i'm done broken and i'm messed up and i got cracks and i got different things that is happening but you can reshape me you can re-mold me into something for you to use something for you to you to take forward and hold in lording and use to your glory so it doesn't always take the most beautiful thing it's the one the most beautiful things most time is the thing that always sits on the shelf and you never use it's the thing that you go in the house and you see it's worn and you said that's that's a cup that's been used right there many people that's the one that got some vents and some bruises yeah they use that must be their favorite one because you can tell how it looks and then there's one sitting up in the glass thing that you never touch it looks so beautiful when sometimes god you does the same thing he says i don't necessarily need the perfect what i need is someone to work with he said i don't need the perfect i need someone to work with so that you and and it's he wants you to give that sacrifice and say lord i'm willing lord i'm willing and i'm able to be to use lord i surrender so that i can be willing lord i i come for forgiveness so that i can be willing lord i sacrifice so that i can't be willing for you to use me the broken pieces you can put them back together and make them what you want and just and sometimes if you cheat the process you'll pay for it later if you cheat the process you'll pay for it later and sometimes we don't understand that oh i'm just getting by here or i'm just going to skate by here and it's going to be all right i got time i got time i i'll fix it later but what you're not understanding is that you miss your foundation you missing the foundation and whatever you skipping now all you're gonna do is build on it later and when you're building on it you can have you can have the most beautiful building in a faulty foundation and that builds in the fall you can have the most pretty thing that you sitting on top of it but if the foundation isn't stable and firm it will fall that's why you want to be anchored in jesus you want your foundation to be in the word of god your foundation to be in prayer to be in studying and getting closer to god because that won't fail that foundation won't ever shake it's a it's a solid rock it's standing there when the water comes and the winds blow it'll stand stable it'll stand firm a willing vessel that's sitting on top of the rock of jesus they're standing there and says and you're sitting there and saying lord keep me lord keep me i'm a i'm a vessel and i got my cracks and bruises but lord keep me reshape me remold me lord keep me lord in the shadow of your wings lord keep me lord i i want to commit to you and give to you you said what abind on earth your mind in heaven and you're able to keep me you're able to keep this will and vessel even though it's empty you will fill it up you'll fill it up with lord your anointing your power and your holy ghost it said it only takes small steps he only asked for two things he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus and for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost god don't ask for a lot he don't ask for a lot he just asks for small things because he knows that if you do those small things they'll turn into something greater if you do those small things it'll turn your life around it'll stop you from going to hell it'll stop you from going doing things that you never thought that i would do but if you don't if you don't choose the right steps you'll fall if you don't choose the right path you're going to fall because you're cheating the process you're cheating what you're going through and you and you're willingly doing things that god don't god don't want you to do but god he always works in the small things he always worked in the small things it's not always the big show it's not always even the jews missed him because they thought he was going to come as a king and he came as a babe he came as something so small and something so ordinary that most people's like that can't be god that can't be god he overheating he eaten just like me and you he riding the donkey and he doing things just like me and you but but they said even some of the pharisees and sadducees recognized and said like nicodemus the things that you do can only be god the works that you do can only be god because jesus was a willing vessel that god used he was a willing vessel that came to earth and god used him and he would he was god created but god used him and all it takes is you being a willing vessel all it takes is you saying lord i surrender and give it all to you and if you truly give it to him i know god will keep you i know he will keep you because he's faithful and that he that he who is faithful in that which is least is faithful also and much all it takes is a little for god to do uh great things all it takes is small amount for you to for god to do great things you just look at an apple seed and you plant that you may not see the fruits for years and years to come but that don't mean it's not coming that don't mean that that seed that was planted a long time ago won't come to fruition and you you reap the harvest and so it all it takes is a small thing to produce something great all it takes is one person life to produce something great it only takes one person getting dedicated to produce a revival only takes one person getting down and and being faithful in prayer that god can move in the midst only takes one person to be praying for your brother to stop something from happening to you it only takes one person standing in the gap for you to keep that hedge of protection of god around your life all it takes is one small thing and someone being a willing vessel and say lord use me lord send me and i'll go amen [Applause] i appreciate the word tonight hey man let's get a lot of hand clapping praise hey man i will investigate man you know i was thinking about some things you know as my brother caleb was speaking i know uh this week you know lord was dealing with me on some things but i was just saying like i to myself i had a moses moment you know how god when he came to moses and he told him imma send you down moses thing was lord who am i that you should send me because he looks at himself and maybe his age and all his failures in his life and all his insufficiencies so i said this week i had a moses moment because i look at sometimes you know get up in the morning and your day planned out from the time you get up to the time you lay down at night you got one thing after another and then i said lord you know our desire of our heart and that is to just be close to you sometimes you want to just go away and and just be by yourself and just get that that time with the lord but you know just through the the times that we live in sometimes it's hard to do that because we in in time just moving so fast as they say we're experiencing that and you know next thing you know it's going on and on and on but then i was saying to myself i said lord you know looking at all your insufficiencies when i began to say lord even when it come down to the ministry it's many that more adequate whatever or can do things even their lives look to be more sufficient as mine more than mine sometimes you go into that place i was thinking of that way but then the lord began dealing with my heart and just showing me its levels of grace that god gave us and i thank god for that because i said that what it is that's i don't know about you but that's how i'm living right now i'm living on the grace of god because i believe that god knows the heart of a man and he knows what's in that man heart some that he might not let get by but some not saying you you you fall in and all that way but it's levels of grace that god give you so i was thinking about that tonight as brother kayla was talking about a willing vessel and i says that's what it is god god don't need your strength come on god don't need your money he don't need y'all like he told moses moses said i can't speak he said but who made the man's mouth moses had all kind of excuses but what god wanted him to see was moses this ain't you anyway he said but i've come down all i need is just a vessel to go down come on and once the lord can let us see that that we can get away from ourselves and what we think we've achieved because remember we can't do nothing without god anyway all that we have in a moment you know tomorrow it could be gone couldn't it i was thinking as was saying last week how short life is life is so short but so tomorrow can be something totally different i've seen some uh boys at work you know picking at this other guy because of uh because of a sickness that he had a illness that he has he has tourette's but and i i got grieved sometimes because i says you know that could be you tomorrow come on that could be your children i says we only live and by the grace of god whether you know it or not come on whether you know it or not we only living about the grace that god allowed us we only able to press our way through to be able to praise god by the grace that god has given you you know we've been going on this this embark embarking upon this month of you know consecration and things and you know sometimes you know you look at those days and you say man it's going to be kind of hard but nevertheless supernatural things be happening i'm a witness to that i was telling my wife last week a couple days i went the whole day but what it is it was the lord that done those things time you know go on and on and on but i said it's what it is we look at our insufficiencies don't we sometimes but it's it's levels of grace that god that god gives us and then that you know a lot of times i like how the scripture says that the weakness of god is stronger than men come on the foolishness of god is what wiser than men and i i i believe that with all of my heart i says what it is when you see yourself as being insufficient or the insufficiencies don't you know that's where god that's what god can work with i was thinking about gideon and how he was hiding from his enemies in in wine press and all that and then when the angel come to him the salutation was getting that mighty man of valor didn't he he says i could see gideon may be looking at himself saying how you say i'm a mighty man of valor yet we hide them from our enemies but what it was god knew what was in him god knew that pushed in the corner what what he what can what he would bring out of him you know something that was in my heart i said you know uh a tree can only bear the life that's in that tree and the fruit that come out of it not necessarily makes it good or bad but it just identifies what what's in that tree come on so we can say apple orange whatever but the tree is going to be known by the fruit it bears so the life that we produce we don't it only bear witness i mean the fruits that we produce in our life is only bear witness of the life that's in you so a lot of times we can claim certain things but what's going to come out of you is what the life that's in you if the life of christ is in there then it's going to come out in the time when you pushed in the corner somebody said i just didn't come on but in the time when that life appears it's only going to appear what was in you you believe that tonight but i say is that what it is you know that's why god knows what's in you and that's why it gets us to certain places pushes in certain trials and tribulations in our lives because he know what's in us we don't know what's in us sometimes i believe the bible says i know it's just paraphrasing the heart deceitful wicked and no man can know it come on god know what's in there but he gets you to that place sometimes and he allows you to see what's in there you see yourself as being weak but then you find out that hey you was a little stronger than you thought you was but what it was it wasn't you but god planted that in you come on he says greater is he that is in you now that might be a sin until you come to that time of your trial till you come to that time of your persecution things happen then you see what something takes over and rise up then you find strength that you didn't know you had come on and i said god that's what it is we want to learn i believe that as individuals how to yield to god how to let god have his way in our life now even though i was praying tonight i was thinking about that little song lord i give you my heart and i give you my soul come on i live for you alone know what the song says and that's what it is we don't just give god just our natural all these things which those things you know that's what men do to brag and look out all those things but when a man giving his heart and soul to god maybe nobody don't see him praying come on nobody don't see him doing those little things that nobody else don't want to do but god see it because that man is sold out to god everything to be done ain't done on the mountaintop but i say where are you in the secret place because in the secret place the prophet god talked about those in the dark ages and how they made it through he said he says because they had secret lives hidden alive their lives was they had the hidden lives what made them strong to make it through all that persecution because of those hidden lives and that's what it is what's going to get us through today come on we're living in a world dark dark world and the world you know the world hates you if it loves you then remember the world of its own but they hate you come on the devil want to do anything he can do to do what destroy your life destroy your soul i told someone before i says you know sometimes when you're dealing i'll say it like this even with natural family they may love you like that feel your love but you have to be careful sometimes because of spirits come on to do what drag you on the other side but what it is you and i uh those gates we'll minister on that sunday by the lord's will but those gates come on you got to let the holy ghost guard those gates because you don't want to be found in that day weighed in the balance come on and found warning but nevertheless what are we here to do we're here to make this journey come on are you here to make this journey and i said that all of our what is all our are running to do our running not to be in vain but we living this life so we can live again you can see those that have that have gone on and all those things and you say i'll see you then but you got to make it there come on we still got a race to run don't we we still got a battle to fight do you believe that tonight but i says what it is you gotta it's gotta be a will you gotta be a willing vessel as brother keller was saying i i thought that was good because i was thinking on that way one day this week i said look at all your insufficiencies in all reality sometimes you say lord is it somebody else that you that you want to raise up come on in your heart because you said lord there's many that could do a way better job than i can but the lord sometimes what it is it ain't your choosing it's god's choosing and i just said lord whatever you want just let me be faithful that's all i want i want to be faithful in it amen [Applause] praise god god it's good amen you know just talking to a few passages today and then i was just studying some of the things the prophet god was bringing out and i said one thing about the message of the iowa where god's servant is born it's always pointing us back to the bible back to the bible you're always putting the emphasis on the baptism of the holy ghost the more you read and study the message of the hour you can see the emphasis put on the word of god stay with the word stay with the bible the bible the bible the bible the word of god because he's he's constantly saying the word is god in letter phone the word is god in letter form stay with the bible because that's the word that's god can't add to it you can't take away from it stay with the bible praise god don't get away from the bible stay with that that's your absolute amen thank god you appreciate the word stay with the word don't make the message something in the bible something else amen praise god it's the word that was preached to us amen that we were to return back to the word the faith that was once delivered into the sinks it's the bible amen not another book amen but the bible amen ain't god good we're going to give brother charles a couple of minutes to give him a little bit of his testimony but charles come on up and give a little bit of your testimony first of all it's truly an honor i give glory praise and honor to the lord jesus christ amen for saving me amen at age 29 in a prison i was in chicago in drugs and gangs and very disobedient to my mom had a father that i was fatherless because at age two he left my mother and us and then 21 years later when i was 23 i went to visit him and my stepmother and i said to uh well she said you could sit in the living room i sit in there about 40 some minutes she came in and she said charles she said uh where's percy i said you know she said have you talked to him i said no ma'am it's very me went outside he's uh barbecuing the ribs and uh and she said she had a hands on hip she said percy your son is her child he said that ain't my son john and when he said uh tears ran incessantly down my eyes you know and everything was like a downward downward downward because rejection you know when you get rejected especially by your own father you know it's a blow and i began to he started crying i got angry i used to carry guns and stuff you know and just just start doing wrong you know but i thank god that prison delivered me prison saved me some the bible says all things work together for the good all things may not be good but they'll work together for your good and they work together for my good and i thank god that while being in prison you know eight nine ten hours a day reading the bible and one thing i said to god when he when i gave my life to him i said if you're teaching me your bible i'll teach you people for the first year and a half i never went out to wreck read even when they cut the lights out i'd be on the i'd be down on the float like this trying to read and uh i was very diligent and after that year and a half i went out on the yard and started ministering the word every prison i went to i just started ministering the word and everybody knew me as a preacher and most of these institutions from uh broad river uh to uh libra evans uh lee county at lee county i was in b1148 chesterfield north you know i was in a dorm where everything was locked down real rough and and i used to work in the cafeteria everything and i'd come back from cafeteria i used to feed the men top tier in the dark bottom tier because i bring food back at nine o'clock you know so i thank god for the wilderness i thank god amen for when you when you think that you can't do your your dependency or your sufficiency is is on god and you look to him and that's what i thank god for i thank god for the man of god amen he is truly a man of god a god man after god's own heart it feeds the house of god here with knowledge and with understanding jeremiah 3 15 so i thank god for the word willingness you know because the bible says if we be willing isaiah 1 19 if we be willing and obedient be the good land so i thank god thank god for what you shared man of god you know uh brokenness the bible says a broken and contrite spirit he won't despise psalm 51 so i thank god for that there you know thank god for the young people though it may be small that's what gideon god said you got too many it was 3 000. it went down to 2 700 and god only used 300. you know god will take out not enough and make it more than enough god bless you praise god time is short and we got to pray more than we ever prayed before i'm talking about if you're missing out on prayer brother and sister you can't make this journey you're going to be left right behind and people that you love people that you should have stood in the gap for your family members your children people that you you said you cared about but you didn't pray you you didn't spend that needed time in prayer the needed time that's why amen god is trying to call us to a book seem like we don't want to do that for but i believe god is calling us back to prayer practice seeking his face back to standing in the gap somebody just signed and crying because of the abomination done in the city if we're going to help our families you're going to help the people you love you're going to have to stand in the gap you're going to have to start crying like to god you're going to have to spend time praying and calling on god you know sometimes you're just walking working it's jesus lord heaven sometimes people get heavy on your heart you got to start praying amen and you can't wait till somebody said pray for me you got to pray right then you just say let me pray for you brother let me pray for you sister somebody said tell somebody to pray tell a preacher to pray for me he said i'm gonna pray for you amen when i see the preacher i'll tell him i'm gonna pray for you now are you with me and let's get to praying i'll tell you when you get to praying you're going to see the results you're going to see great results through fasting and through prayer you see great results amen and you look for great results in the things that you wouldn't begging god and asking god to do watch god begin to just do those things and you say oh if i knew a long time ago see we wasted a lot of time if i knew a long time ago then i would have spent this time because i've been talking and witnessing and doing this and doing that but if i only would have prayed then i would have known what to say and i would have known how to witness because but when i spent the time in praying god began to move brother and sister that's what we want to spend time crying out to god and telling god you know because he knows amen you'll find yourself saying things and when you say things that you know you ain't saying and you remember those things you know sometimes i'm on my knees and i start writing why because i'm saying things that i know i ain't saying so i take the notes you need to start taking notes and you because sometimes god be prophesied and telling you things that succumb and you'll find out that god is dealing with you god is speaking to you and you might tell somebody what you know when i was praying this came up this person came up call them up and and see how they doing and see what god and then you begin to flow in the supernatural beginning to flow in the spirit of the lord god began to speak to needs god began to show you what to do the problem that you're having on the job god began to resolve those problems and show you how to fix things show you how to do things god began to do that in the prayer he said oh god things begin to flow your enemies become your footstool things begin to move amen i mean those demon powers amen sometimes amen daniel was praying for 21 days amen but the angel was delayed amen he said god heard him when he first started but he had a delay amen but daniel amen i heard you amen but so by the grace of god god he might be delayed but he come in amen but you got to keep on believing keep on praying keep on trusting god because god's going to do what he's saying all you gotta do is put your confidence in him and god you said i'm oh i'm taking you at your word lord nevertheless your word god what you said god i know it's got to come to pass because oh god you declined it in your word and i got just said the lord because i got dust at the word praise god hallelujah sometimes we wait on a prophet that prophesied we went on somebody to give us a word of prophecy amen but the word of god is here amen praise god that's your word of prophecy amen amen have faith in what god said amen and prophesy to yourself david encouraged himself in the lord amen it's time for you to prophesy amen praise god not ezekiel bones but can these bones can i live praise god hallelujah i must amen not not look at it back then but i gotta take it up out of history and i gotta let praise god the dry bones live now praise god in me praise god all the dry places all the oh god hallelujah if you want things to change then you speak it if you want the rain amen if you've been in a drought and you need rain you call for the rain praise god hallelujah god is good amen appreciate him amen if you be willing and obedient you eat the fat of the land but you got to be willing in obedience amen to brother simmons no to the word of god praise god hallelujah i don't have no problem i tell you you know when a person fall in love with jesus when a person accept jesus and really from the heart you got no problem with them being baptized in water in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you don't have no problem with them seeking the baptism in the holy ghost because if they come to god right they may they're willing to do whatever god wants whatever your words say lord but if they halfway come praise god that won't work amen when they surrender all amen god bless you appreciate the word tonight appreciate you that come tonight amen it's a present way but thank god amen is it worth your effort it's worth your press everything god oh oh you do right god bless you let us stand uh be seated got a testimony come on up and tell the testimony i was out here with a prayer i looked back at my phone like you said you know you still have to be in prayer and and i was praying and i was just you know you got the mic on i was praying and you know like they were saying sometimes you think you so you're insufficient and you question you're not saying you're not questioning god you're just questioning like these your decisions that you made throughout your life and you're like well lord did i make the right decision here did i make the right decision there and it came to me the other voice came i was in prayer it was on october the 9th was out on saturday and it said my grace is sufficient for you and so my brother ernest said you know about my grace and that was the exact words that came to me that saturday and i put it in my phone that saturday i went back like i said look at the date and the day it said my grace is sufficient for you so to me that was just confirmation what he said with the lord just confirming his word to me that his grace you know i may not need everything perfect and right but his grace is sufficient for me [Applause] it was assault summoning any other testimonies anybody else well god is good y'all want to hurry up and get home well thank the lord it's gracious official i got so many testimonies god is doing so many things and i ain't gonna start because it's just so much until i'm just being quiet and sometimes my uh johnson said rachel said daddy daddy what did god do i said let somebody else tell and i ain't telling it you know see when god is moving and they know god is in action he's doing some things you know somebody else tell those testimonies because you know you don't want to you know it's difficult when god is using you for you to testify you know it's it's kind of difficult after a while it'll all come to it'll come where god uh let somebody else tell a story he said let somebody else praise you don't don't you praise yourself let somebody else do it and god will let somebody else tell a testimony some some testimonies you want you to tell but as a whole many times amen you take away the glory from god if you amen if you go ahead but just let god do it amen when god is blessing and pouring out blessings and doing things and great things amen what's done in secret to come to the light whether it's good or whether it's bad amen and some things you don't want to you know you don't you don't want to mess with praise god it's some things i i told people i see god move and i just move out the way and sometimes i avoid people because they be lifting you up so high and god's in my glory will i not give to another amen because i am a jealous god and god is so jealous so uh brother and sister amen it seemed like god is taking your places and doing things for you you got to know you got to stay out of the way you got to stay humble and stay out the way because if you if god is doing those things and you get in the way you're getting all the glory so it'll be like them you know what i was reading the prophet saying and it's it's the bible too but it was it's just something that i was just looking at he said now and this is this is being said again those that come in that day said lord then i prophesied in my your name then i cast out devils then i do many wonderful works he's gonna say depart from me your work was of iniquity and i don't know i didn't know you right never knew you amen why because why because you got all the glory for those things everything you you didn't give god the glory you wanted the glory you know and god can look down at our hearts and he can see everything and then it's the one that you know when god is using somebody see like god was using jesus was being used by god he wasn't he wasn't doing nothing of himself but you didn't know they wanted to kill him because they were jealous of him and they wanted to kill him you know and that's you know sometimes they are accusing the spirit of god it's something brother carry on saying today he said you got to be careful how you talk against about the holy ghost he said you got to be careful when you talk about pentecost and pentecost that because he said you got to be careful because you can be blaspheming the holy ghost and you know because god can be moving and people's unrecognized they they think it's a oh ah that ain't nothing amen you don't be careful because there's a lot of people thought they had a revelation who god was and those are the people and the prophet god said they'll be the people that gonna persecute the saints just like they did of old the jews killed jesus he said watch in the end time he said watch them do the same thing he said the denominations would do the same thing to the bride i'm not talking about people say they're in this message but i'm talking about some people have a denomination of spirit and think they you know the bride and they'll kill you and they think they're doing god service are you with me praise god so i'm saying to you watch these spirits in the last days when god is moving in a supernatural way it'll be a spirit they're going to come against you and it'll say that's the devil that's what the jews said they called invisible they called him the devil but god was doing things you know especially when it's a when it's a when it's a powerful move of god people look at it you're going to have to see what side of the fence you're going to be on when god is moving if he's moving with you it is a spirit of jealousy i don't know you know because he ain't moving with you but he'd be moving with the little ones somebody small insignificant with god moving in their life and vindicating it amen their ministry and their lives don't talk about somebody pray for them and say lord i thank you just going about your business if you don't know just go head on well they're not in the message leave them alone go ahead home just pray for your brother break i mean pray and make sure that you're doing what god called you to do because some things you won't understand and i'm saying be very careful because some things you don't understand god bless you let us stand okay
