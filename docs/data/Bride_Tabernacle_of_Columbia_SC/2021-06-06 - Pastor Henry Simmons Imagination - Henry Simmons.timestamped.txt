[41:56] in jesus name amen
[42:00] genesis 6
[42:03] and 1
[42:08] and it came to pass that when men began
[42:11] to multiply on the face of the earth
[42:15] that the daughters were born unto them
[42:19] and the sons of god saw the daughters of
[42:21] men that they were
[42:22] fair and they took them
[42:25] wives of all which were cho
[42:29] which they chose and the lord
[42:32] said my spirit shall not always strive
[42:35] with man
[42:36] for that he also is flesh
[42:40] yet his days shall be in 120 years
[42:44] there were giants in the earth
[42:47] in those days and also
[42:51] after that when the sons of god
[42:54] came into the daughters of men
[42:59] and they bear children to them
[43:02] the same became mighty men which were of
[43:06] old men of renown
[43:09] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[43:12] was great in the earth and that every
[43:16] imagination and thought of his heart
[43:19] was only evil continually
[43:23] and it repented the lord that he made
[43:26] man on
[43:27] the earth and it grieved him at his
[43:30] heart
[43:31] and the lord's in the lord
[43:34] said i will destroy man whom i have
[43:37] created
[43:38] from the face of the earth both man
[43:42] beasts and creeping things and the files
[43:45] of the air for
[43:46] it repented me that i have made them
[43:50] but nor found grace in the
[43:53] eyes of the lord may god bless you read
[43:56] this word you may be seated
[43:59] this morning as we talk about
[44:02] imagination
[44:05] i remember when i was in the world they
[44:08] said
[44:09] saying a song was just my imagination
[44:11] running away with me
[44:13] and i believe the imagination have ran
[44:16] the way with the fault
[44:19] the imagination i want to
[44:23] look at luke 17
[44:27] luke 17. and i believe folks imagination
[44:32] has
[44:32] ran completely away from them
[44:36] and when we talk about imagination we're
[44:39] talking about purpose and desire
[44:42] it's continually evil
[44:46] god saw that the purpose and desire
[44:50] of man in that particular day
[44:54] was continually evil
[44:57] and we know that this is an evil age
[45:00] that we're living in
[45:02] and the god of this evil age is satan
[45:06] amen the world has been polluted with
[45:10] demon
[45:10] powers and everywhere you look the devil
[45:14] looked like he's controlling he meant
[45:18] the political the religious
[45:19] and the spiritual realm
[45:25] and those three unclean spirits like
[45:27] frogs
[45:29] amen but god amen
[45:32] with amen the pale horse rider riding in
[45:36] death and hell riding
[45:39] god will amen when the enemy come in
[45:42] like a flood then god would send an
[45:44] eagle an anointing
[45:46] amen the man faced of an eagle
[45:50] amen was the type of john amen you had
[45:53] matthew mark luke and john john
[45:56] wrote about writing as an eagle as
[46:00] god amen matthew wrote about him as a
[46:04] lion as a king
[46:06] amen mark wrote about him as an
[46:10] ox as a servant amen
[46:13] and luke wrote about him as a man
[46:16] amen but john wrote about him as an
[46:20] eagle god
[46:21] we need an eagle in this age and he said
[46:25] whether caucus is there where the eagles
[46:27] should be gathered together

[51:40] are you with me prophet of god it says
[51:43] a lot of times dealing with their

[52:19] in what
[52:20] marriage until the day
[52:24] the noah entered into the ark and the
[52:27] flood came
[52:29] and destroyed them what praise god
[52:32] isn't it sad that like it was then so
[52:37] shall it be now
[52:40] likewise also as it was in the days of
[52:43] what
[52:45] days of our lives they did what they ate
[52:48] in the what and they what
[52:53] you know sometimes you have to stop
[52:54] buying and just stand still long enough
[52:58] you get a little money in your pocket
[52:59] you want to buy
[53:02] just buy you can't
[53:05] um so that can't be satisfied with
[53:07] nothing
[53:09] just go get it why are you getting
[53:12] i feel like i won't do so i want that
[53:14] stand still a little while
[53:17] praying sometimes instead of getting
[53:20] give
[53:22] find a way to give somebody and bless
[53:25] somebody
[53:26] but we're too busy trying to
[53:29] being selfish looking at ourselves
[53:35] how many times have you thought about
[53:36] somebody else
[53:41] we we're so stingy
[53:44] he said blessed is the one cheer for
[53:47] what
[53:50] okay and you you wonder why it's more
[53:53] blessed to what
[53:54] give then what
[53:58] see sometimes folk don't receive because
[54:00] they're not givers
[54:03] you got to be a giver to receive
[54:07] oh i wonder why i'm not blessed you're
[54:08] not a giver
[54:11] amen one of my other folks are blessed
[54:14] and i'm not blessed
[54:15] you're not a giver if i had to give i
[54:18] give
[54:18] give what you got
[54:22] amen you might not have much but give
[54:24] what you got
[54:26] and god will bless that what you give
[54:29] but if you hold back on god
[54:33] you know the holy ghost never spoke to
[54:35] anybody to give such and such
[54:40] do this many times
[54:43] the lord said empty your pocket
[54:46] and i said oh goodness hit me in my
[54:49] pocket
[54:50] give everything you got it's empty
[54:54] he said you can't think about it if you
[54:57] thought about it you ain't gonna empty
[54:58] it
[54:59] you said that muscle was uh i don't know
[55:00] what that was spoken to me tell me
[55:04] you know you question it but when god
[55:07] tell you to
[55:08] be a blessing to so-and-so
[55:13] a lot of times folks don't listen to the
[55:15] voice of god
[55:18] there's more blessings to give than it
[55:20] is to receive
[55:22] but some so many people so trying to
[55:24] bless themselves by receiving so much
[55:29] all they can see is the dollar sign and
[55:31] the more they see dollars the more they
[55:33] want dollars
[55:36] and they think they blessing themselves
[55:40] sometimes god give to you for you to
[55:42] give to somebody else
[55:43] it's not for you it's for you to give
[55:48] but a lot of times folk get and they
[55:51] think that's the blessing of the lord
[55:52] that they can just keep
[55:53] getting and building bonds and bigger
[55:55] bonds and bigger bonds
[56:01] and say so be at ease and take your rest
[56:05] and some of the bigger givers are the
[56:06] biggest the bigger
[56:08] blessings people that are being blessed
[56:12] extraordinary because they give
[56:16] and they give freely from the heart and
[56:19] god keep
[56:19] on blessing them those that give grudges
[56:23] amen and sparingly
[56:27] but those that give with a cheerful
[56:29] heart
[56:30] they began to be blessed abundantly
[56:34] are you with me but a lot of people give
[56:37] and they give
[56:38] on they average their dollar
[56:42] i used to see preachers that had
[56:46] tremendous jobs and i used to see
[56:49] you have a meeting they put their dollar
[56:52] in
[56:53] you know they said minimum wages went up
[56:56] but they showed that dollar didn't
[56:58] change god blessed them more
[57:01] but they gave the same much no matter
[57:03] how many times god bless them
[57:05] they kept this is what i give you know
[57:09] when god bless you your giving should
[57:12] increase
[57:13] the more god bless you the more your
[57:15] giving should increase
[57:17] are you with me but if you hold back on
[57:20] god
[57:21] and don't try to be a blessing to
[57:23] somebody else but trying to bless
[57:25] yourself
[57:26] the more you try to bless yourself all
[57:28] kind of stuff will begin to happen
[57:29] to your cause something happened on the
[57:31] job something happening in
[57:33] your body something happen this way and
[57:35] you every time you try to bless yourself
[57:37] you end up cursing yourself
[57:40] are you a man don't try to bless your
[57:43] own self and make your own self rich
[57:46] amen if god wants you to be rich it'll
[57:49] come to you
[57:51] amen you don't have to strive to be
[57:54] labeled to be rich
[57:56] amen having food and women learn to be
[58:00] content amen god wants you to be
[58:04] contented
[58:04] because some folk the rich pierced
[58:07] themselves with many sorrows
[58:10] are you with me some folk because the
[58:13] love of money is
[58:14] what some folk is in the
[58:17] the root of all evil because they love
[58:20] dollar signs
[58:22] it's the root of all evil the love of it
[58:25] amen
[58:26] so when you love it you ain't gonna give
[58:28] it up
[58:30] are you with me because you love it
[58:34] amen you think oh i'm already broke
[58:37] and you think broke your i talk broke
[58:40] and you'll be broke
[58:43] are you up man praise god but you talk
[58:46] i'm blessed i'm blessed in spite of god
[58:50] has blessed me and i'm continually
[58:52] blessed amen
[58:53] praise god and you begin to receive from
[58:57] god
[58:57] amen as you speak it into existence
[59:01] amen you have what you say
[59:04] amen praise god if you say it and don't
[59:07] mean
[59:08] it amen but you a double-minded man is
[59:11] unstable in
[59:12] all his ways amen praise god
[59:15] you send it to consume it upon your own
[59:18] lust amen and that's why god ain't
[59:22] giving you nothing because he know what
[59:23] you're going to do with it
[59:26] praise god you want to lift yourself up
[59:28] somewhere where you don't need to be
[59:32] are you i don't know why i'm going this
[59:34] way
[59:35] praise god but it takes a humble spirit
[59:37] to realize
[59:38] the will of god and the purpose of god
[59:40] and why god wants to bless you
[59:44] but you recognize when god the lessons
[59:47] flow to you
[59:48] amen you ought to be a blessing to
[59:50] somebody else
[59:57] that ain't that wasn't in there i just
[59:58] put that on the sideline for dessert
[1:00:02] it wasn't in the message okay
[1:00:08] said here we are
[1:00:13] and floyd came and destroyed them all
[1:00:14] 28. likewise also

[1:00:23] their soul
[1:00:24] and they what planted and they what
[1:00:29] you can't get man they're building
[1:00:30] everywhere isn't that right
[1:00:33] y'all wonder how it was in the days of
[1:00:35] noah
[1:00:36] and how it was in the days a lot
[1:00:41] he said
[1:00:45] but the 29th verse but the same day the
[1:00:47] lot went out of
[1:00:49] sodom it rained what
[1:00:53] out of heaven and what god give us a
[1:00:57] chance to get out of sodom

[1:01:16] was in the days of sodom
[1:01:19] amen praise god
[1:01:22] the spirits are taking over the world
[1:01:25] fallen angels have pressed themselves
[1:01:28] into men bodies
[1:01:30] amen because they re oh god let me let
[1:01:33] me go read this last verse
[1:01:34] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:01:36] the son of man is revealed
[1:01:39] praise god as lot
[1:01:42] amen was done in sodom abraham wasn't in
[1:01:46] sodom
[1:01:48] praise god and three angels came
[1:01:52] and visited abraham and said shall i
[1:01:53] hide from abraham the thing
[1:01:56] the bible says surely the lord god will
[1:01:57] do nothing but he reveals the secret to
[1:01:59] his servant the prophet isn't that right
[1:02:01] so before god does any major thing he
[1:02:04] reveals it to a prophet
[1:02:05] and the prophet get warned and before
[1:02:07] judgment
[1:02:08] are you what man so amen and abraham
[1:02:12] interceded for a lot and said
[1:02:14] lord pray eventually if you find ten
[1:02:17] will you spare the city these are out
[1:02:18] spat if i find 10.
[1:02:20] you mean to tell me when god comes back
[1:02:22] he ain't going to find 10 on this whole
[1:02:23] earth
[1:02:25] you know the prophet god says one in a
[1:02:27] million isn't that right
[1:02:29] out of a million you might find one
[1:02:32] praise god look at how many million
[1:02:34] people in this world
[1:02:37] are you with me but you got to say i'm
[1:02:40] one in a million
[1:02:42] i thank god i'm one of them praise god
[1:02:45] it might be a million
[1:02:47] amen but i'm one
[1:02:50] of them i'm one in a million
[1:02:53] let's just see how faithful we can be to
[1:02:55] god's word
[1:02:57] let's see how faithful we can be to god
[1:03:00] amen your life is a manifestation of
[1:03:03] what you believe
[1:03:04] it doesn't it doesn't matter what you
[1:03:06] say but your life speak louder than your
[1:03:09] words
[1:03:11] oh you look man so you got to look
[1:03:14] recognize that every thought and
[1:03:16] imagination amen
[1:03:18] and what as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:03:20] what
[1:03:22] so is he every imagination that thought
[1:03:25] a men's heart was continually what
[1:03:28] evil so man heart amen
[1:03:32] praise god is despitefully wicked and
[1:03:35] who can know it says jeremiah
[1:03:38] oh you look man so who oh
[1:03:41] i gotta go but he said here
[1:03:44] in the third even thus shall it be in
[1:03:46] the day when the son of man is revealed
[1:03:49] now amen god was revealing himself to
[1:03:52] abraham before solomon burned
[1:03:54] isn't that right so god reveals himself
[1:03:57] to
[1:03:58] us in this age before amen
[1:04:01] uh the world burns are you with me
[1:04:05] so we have a revelation that god will
[1:04:07] come and speak to us
[1:04:09] and reveal the son of man ministry to us
[1:04:12] in this age so we have a son of man
[1:04:15] ministry amen revealed to us to get us
[1:04:18] ready amen and to call you and i out of
[1:04:22] sodom
[1:04:24] we've been called out amen but we
[1:04:27] what amen
[1:04:31] we wasn't in sodom as the denominational
[1:04:34] system was
[1:04:35] are you up there i'm talking to you two
[1:04:37] kind of ways
[1:04:39] are you with me i hope you receive it
[1:04:41] praise god
[1:04:43] for those that don't understand amen
[1:04:45] abraham never was
[1:04:48] in solomon it was locked because he saw
[1:04:52] the green grass and the greased grass
[1:04:53] fooled them
[1:04:55] so he ended up in sodom he pitched his
[1:04:58] tent towards what
[1:05:00] sodom but he ended up where when you put
[1:05:03] your tent towards the things of the
[1:05:05] world you end up in the world amen all
[1:05:08] you got to do is put your tent in that
[1:05:10] direction
[1:05:11] amen because you you're looking at the
[1:05:13] green grass and the green grass or what
[1:05:16] it'll fool you amen praise god the
[1:05:19] the grass look greener on the uh
[1:05:22] on the other side when you get in on the
[1:05:24] other side you realize
[1:05:26] amen it's hard to come back over
[1:05:29] on the lord's side isn't that right
[1:05:32] somebody
[1:05:34] i i got to move on uh let's go to romans
[1:05:38] 1.
[1:05:40] we're you know we're in an evil age
[1:05:42] where people don't want truth no more
[1:05:45] and they don't want you to tell the
[1:05:46] truth they try to bind you up
[1:05:50] if you tell truth they're going to say
[1:05:52] amen praise god
[1:05:54] there's something wrong with you amen
[1:05:57] because we
[1:05:57] we we've been made to accept by
[1:06:00] intellectual knowledge
[1:06:01] we got to accept sin
[1:06:04] amen what the devil try to make a a a
[1:06:08] better world
[1:06:09] to sin in are you with me but god want
[1:06:12] to get us out of this cosmos this world
[1:06:15] order amen
[1:06:17] god wanted to give us amen a new heaven
[1:06:19] and a new earth
[1:06:21] so god amen does it in spirit realm amen
[1:06:24] in spirit realm he said any man be in
[1:06:27] christ jesus he's a new one
[1:06:29] he's a new creature he's a new creation
[1:06:31] god has recreated you in christ jesus
[1:06:34] unto good works are you what man so he
[1:06:37] said let this mind be in you that was
[1:06:39] also in christ jesus who being in the
[1:06:41] form of god
[1:06:41] thought it not robbery to be good with
[1:06:43] god he said therefore being
[1:06:45] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:06:48] are you with me that you might prove
[1:06:50] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:06:52] perfect will of god
[1:06:53] isn't that right so god gives us a new
[1:06:55] creation with a new mind we don't think
[1:06:57] like the world thing praise god
[1:07:00] your thoughts are not my thoughts uh are
[1:07:03] you with me
[1:07:04] so god we started thinking heavenly amen
[1:07:07] we start thinking like our father the
[1:07:10] amen praise god
[1:07:11] because we have the mind of god they met
[1:07:15] praise god and the mind we had
[1:07:16] was a he met praise god with the enmity
[1:07:19] against god and wasn't subject to the
[1:07:21] laws of the god
[1:07:22] and neither indeed could it be but god
[1:07:25] has transformed our mind amen
[1:07:29] he's given us the mind of christ praise
[1:07:32] god we've been
[1:07:33] changed praise god the gospel has
[1:07:36] changed our lives
[1:07:38] jesus has come in and he transformed us
[1:07:42] praise god you might not see it on the

[1:23:54] right
[1:23:56] are you with me the children are being
[1:23:59] taught in school it's all right
[1:24:02] on your job you got to put up with it
[1:24:05] everywhere you go
[1:24:06] in the churches the preachers have to
[1:24:08] put up with it
[1:24:10] all you look man so they are making
[1:24:14] accommodation for these spirits to take
[1:24:17] over the church
[1:24:19] and to take over the world but it's got
[1:24:22] to be that way
[1:24:24] so you can't get around and you got to
[1:24:26] get out of here
[1:24:29] are you with me it's time for the

[1:25:27] praise god the person themselves god
[1:25:30] hates sin but he loves the sinner
[1:25:35] are you with me so you got to realize

[1:25:49] you come against that spirit
[1:25:52] are you a man and that spirit don't want

[1:28:10] the man of god was saying and and you
[1:28:12] know the enemy is running run shad but
[1:28:15] greater is he that is in us than he
[1:28:17] that's in the world
[1:28:18] and we can do all things through christ
[1:28:20] who strengthens us
[1:28:22] and as we arm ourselves with the whole
[1:28:24] arm of god by
[1:28:25] you know uh meditating in the word of
[1:28:28] god
[1:28:28] you know uh studying the word of god you
[1:28:31] know
[1:28:32] oftentimes you know we'll you know we'll
[1:28:35] sing the word we hear
[1:28:36] songs got the word in it but there's
[1:28:38] nothing like
[1:28:39] you and i are taking our time daily you
[1:28:42] know and the enemy
[1:28:44] this is what i've learned the enemy will
[1:28:46] fight you
[1:28:48] and me we can be talking about sports we
[1:28:50] can be talking about going to the
[1:28:52] restaurant going shopping
[1:28:53] anybody can bother but the moment you
[1:28:55] and i talk about i'm going to spend some
[1:28:57] time with god
[1:28:58] look like eric the phone started ringing
[1:29:02] people get to want to talk to you call
[1:29:04] you up you say
[1:29:05] i haven't heard from this person you
[1:29:06] know because the bible says he comes for
[1:29:09] the word
[1:29:10] he don't come for you he comes for the
[1:29:12] word once he gets the word
[1:29:14] from getting to you then he got you and
[1:29:16] that's why the bible says amen
[1:29:18] be strong in the lord and in the power
[1:29:20] of his might and the way we are strong
[1:29:22] in the lord amen
[1:29:23] as we continually for this is what i
[1:29:25] used to do every day
[1:29:27] hallelujah before the lord uh you know
[1:29:29] when i gave my life to god
[1:29:30] i used to sit and say uh like for
[1:29:32] instance philippians 4
[1:29:34] uh 13. i can do all things of christ who
[1:29:36] strengthens me i can do all things with
[1:29:38] christ and strengthens me
[1:29:39] i can do all things with christ
[1:29:40] strengthen me i can do all things with
[1:29:41] christ strengthen me i can do all things
[1:29:43] christ's turn to me and then all of a
[1:29:44] sudden it got good to me i'm getting
[1:29:46] i can do all things with christ i can do
[1:29:49] i can do i can do
[1:29:50] now as i start doing this here the word
[1:29:54] from my mind it began now to drench in
[1:29:57] my heart
[1:29:58] and then it begin to take root and once
[1:30:01] the word of god takes root
[1:30:02] then you see the fruit no root no fruit
[1:30:06] you see that's why jesus said you know
[1:30:07] the tree by the fruit at best so
[1:30:10] but if i don't put no word in there then
[1:30:12] i'll be like that man
[1:30:14] in the bible that the bible say when the
[1:30:15] unclean spirit goes out of a man
[1:30:18] walking through dry places seeking rest
[1:30:20] and fight if none
[1:30:21] but when he come back he finds that that
[1:30:23] house is swept garnish and clean
[1:30:25] but it's two ingredients it's not there
[1:30:28] he see that that person they save
[1:30:30] they clean they love the lord but
[1:30:33] there's two ingredients that's not there
[1:30:34] in that house
[1:30:36] the word of god amen and the power of
[1:30:39] the holy ghost
[1:30:41] that's why that's why that unclean
[1:30:43] spirit said
[1:30:45] i know what i do i'll go get seven
[1:30:47] others worse than me
[1:30:49] and that's what and that's what and so
[1:30:50] what are you saying when a person when a
[1:30:52] brother or sister in christ give his or
[1:30:54] her life to the lord jesus christ
[1:30:57] and then they begin to not put the word
[1:31:00] not
[1:31:00] feed on the word just like we eat
[1:31:02] natural food for our nurturement
[1:31:04] and body for vitamin c and so forth we
[1:31:07] need to eat the word of god that's why
[1:31:09] david said oh taste and see
[1:31:11] that the lord is good psalms 119 verse 9
[1:31:14] david said wherewithal shall a young man
[1:31:16] cleanse his way that's a question
[1:31:18] then he answered by taking heed
[1:31:19] according to thy word verse 10
[1:31:21] thy word have i hid in my heart that
[1:31:23] what that i might not sin against thee
[1:31:25] so
[1:31:25] we got to familiarize ourselves and do
[1:31:27] it amen
[1:31:28] just just like you if you're running
[1:31:30] track i used to run track and field you
[1:31:32] know
[1:31:32] the 440 to 880 mile medley you know so
[1:31:36] it became it's an exercise i mean i read
[1:31:38] the word amen
[1:31:39] 10 hours 11 hours you know and trenching
[1:31:42] myself people you say
[1:31:43] man he's going to go crazy no you ain't
[1:31:45] a little you're going to go wise
[1:31:46] see the enemy what you what she called
[1:31:49] crazy is making you wise
[1:31:51] under salvation amen that's why i see
[1:31:53] remember it's always the opposite
[1:31:56] the enemy will never tell you he'll
[1:31:58] always say
[1:31:59] no don't do that
[1:32:02] god know that when you do that you're
[1:32:04] going to be like him it was already like
[1:32:06] him
[1:32:07] you see he's a deceiver and a liar
[1:32:11] but the thing that god showed me in
[1:32:13] genesis and i didn't see this i always
[1:32:15] used to see
[1:32:16] how the woman saw the tree with good
[1:32:17] food but then the lord showed me
[1:32:19] something that i didn't really
[1:32:20] and and pastor said it a little while
[1:32:22] ago
[1:32:23] purpose and desire god is not going to
[1:32:26] overrule
[1:32:27] mind or your desire because the bible
[1:32:30] says in revelation 22
[1:32:31] 17 whosoever will
[1:32:35] whosoever will let him come what are you
[1:32:37] saying you can ask a child to sit down
[1:32:40] the child will sit down but in his heart
[1:32:44] or her heart guess what they standing up
[1:32:48] they did it obediently but what they
[1:32:50] weren't willing
[1:32:53] you you see there and that's why we got
[1:32:55] to love it i would never let me tell you
[1:32:57] something i grew up in in chicago
[1:32:59] in gangs and stuff and and and you know
[1:33:02] my i used to hear my mom she said and my
[1:33:05] sister name because they first got saved
[1:33:07] and then come on go to church child
[1:33:08] someone i ain't i don't want to do with
[1:33:10] that stuff
[1:33:11] you know and i didn't and the thing i'm
[1:33:13] going to tell you something that really
[1:33:14] turned me off
[1:33:15] when i would see one thing them in
[1:33:17] church and i see them living enough you
[1:33:19] know
[1:33:20] we got to be examples and god taught me
[1:33:24] you know be an example don't be no
[1:33:25] hypocrite don't be phony
[1:33:28] don't be a pretender or an actor you see
[1:33:30] and i thank god amen i thank god
[1:33:32] hallelujah for how he's made me
[1:33:34] because if i can be in darkness
[1:33:38] crazy and foolish and wild and strong
[1:33:42] and and what we call fearless
[1:33:45] before uh the people doing wrong
[1:33:49] how much more on the light side you
[1:33:51] understand i'm saying
[1:33:52] in other words not fearing you know
[1:33:54] people looking so look at them gangs
[1:33:56] over there look at them
[1:33:58] you know if god can save me and i was in
[1:34:00] a gang he could say that other gang man
[1:34:03] i remember talking to a mem uh minister
[1:34:06] into a muslim
[1:34:07] this is what the muslim said to me i
[1:34:10] want to pay close attention
[1:34:12] and also listen to the wisdom of god how
[1:34:14] the response that he got to
[1:34:16] he said you see all them hypocrites over
[1:34:18] there
[1:34:19] and that's what i said to him i said
[1:34:21] what are you looking for
[1:34:24] i want somebody was real
[1:34:27] i said why don't you become what you're
[1:34:28] looking for and you'll become your best
[1:34:30] example
[1:34:33] he he uh uh no no no you become what
[1:34:37] you're looking for
[1:34:40] it shed his mouth he said and guess what
[1:34:43] two weeks later
[1:34:45] i'll never forget in the church service
[1:34:47] in the system
[1:34:49] why because i was in prison he ended up
[1:34:51] coming there sitting in the back
[1:34:54] and then next you know i see him come up
[1:34:56] to the altar and give his life to jesus
[1:35:00] god wants to see and the bible says be
[1:35:02] able to answer every man
[1:35:03] the hope of the calling in you i don't
[1:35:05] care if they muslim i used to admit to
[1:35:07] muslim rastafarians
[1:35:09] five percenters god bodies wicked or
[1:35:12] devil worshipers
[1:35:13] even the chapel i never forget they had
[1:35:15] a chaplain come and he starts saying
[1:35:17] well you know jesus was just like tarzan
[1:35:19] and i had all the brothers i said i
[1:35:21] stood up i stood up
[1:35:23] because the other brothers in christ
[1:35:24] they just sitting there letting them
[1:35:25] talk i said
[1:35:27] what did you say i chill mouth mister
[1:35:29] just this just why i dressed him
[1:35:31] what did you see at your mouth mister
[1:35:33] first of all the lord jesus christ is
[1:35:35] lord of lord and king of kings
[1:35:37] how are you going to associate him with
[1:35:39] with some uh television thing on tv
[1:35:42] and when i said those words he got quiet
[1:35:45] tarts turning red and pink in the face
[1:35:47] and the other brothers uh brother
[1:35:49] charles said hey no brother charles
[1:35:53] where's your backbone you don't let
[1:35:56] nobody
[1:35:57] degrade what you believe in do you think
[1:36:00] do you think that do you think that if
[1:36:02] you go on a mosque with the muslims you
[1:36:04] think they're going to let you
[1:36:05] disrespect them
[1:36:06] no they're not they're going to even
[1:36:08] though they're wrong
[1:36:09] but they're going to stand up and in
[1:36:12] psalms 94 16
[1:36:14] it says who will stand up for me against
[1:36:16] the evildoers
[1:36:17] and who will rise up for me against the
[1:36:19] workers of iniquity
[1:36:22] we got amen we got to stand amen
[1:36:25] we can't be afraid god did not give us
[1:36:27] the spirit of fear but power love and a
[1:36:29] sound mind
[1:36:30] or a well-disciplined mind amen so we've
[1:36:33] got to have a conviction
[1:36:36] we have to have a conviction and a
[1:36:37] commitment say lord i'm going to do
[1:36:40] i don't care where to go because for you
[1:36:43] i'll live and for you i'll die
[1:36:45] jesus said if we he that will save his
[1:36:47] life he'll lose it but if we'll lose our
[1:36:49] life for the lord jesus christ
[1:36:50] he said we'll pick it back up he told
[1:36:52] them when they said
[1:36:53] i take your life jesus said you don't
[1:36:55] take my life guess what
