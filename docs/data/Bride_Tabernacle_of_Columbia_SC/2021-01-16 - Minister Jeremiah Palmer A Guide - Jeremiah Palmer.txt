you're still on the throne you're still able to keep oh god and provide the things that we need love for we ask these things in jesus name amen and amen if you have your bibles return with us tonight to the book of psalms psalms 32 it's good to be in the house of the lord again amen pressing the battle amen amen we psalms 32 and 8 32-8 it reads i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shall go i will guide thee with mine i let us pray father god we lord we thank you tonight for your mercy and for your grace lord jesus thank you for your word tonight lord that we o lord are looking unto you father to instruct us even tonight lord lord we need your leadership father god i pray for your people lord and bless the word tonight in jesus name amen may be seated i want to use for a thought tonight as i was listening to one of the messages of the hour on a god and as i began to listening listen to it and within myself i said you know that was really where we really at now in this hour a god many of us if we will go to a foreign country or someplace or another that we not really are familiar with you'll be seeking someone to be able to show you around someone that is familiar with the city or the country or wherever you are going at and one of the reasons that you do that because you just don't want to be wandering around and get lost servant god said that's a good thing that you shouldn't go anywhere where you are not don't have some kind of god that can scruck you where to go and as i was thinking i said lord truly uh this is the hour that we don't need to be wondering with so much chaos and so much epidemic and so much voices that we have saying this and saying that to where uh it puts the people in a confused state because everybody seemed to have an opinion everybody seemed to had even sometimes scientific information and then they come back and say well it's not correct but yet once you put something out there somebody's going to hold to it and some will follow it and then they begin to find out it was wrong but you know i thank god spiritually speaking this hour that we are not left without a god many of us we as i did try to lead myself try to do what i thought and that's where we get in trouble right there we have thought we have plans we have goals we have ambition nothing wrong with that but did you seek the lord after all he is the one that gave you life but man has always tried to lead themselves and if you look at our country we see the chaotic mess we got cause sometimes group of people can form groups of intelligence and put their masterminds together to do a thing but yet without seeking god about it and the bible say in one place that you know uh proverbs i believe it says that there's a way that seemeth right to a man but that way the way of death i look at it in the natural and we know the natural type so spiritual and the servant of god was saying there you know in that message there that uh a god has to be a selected person anybody just can't be a guy like we got now today we have people that have no training no no kind of background no kind of uh experience and and they lead the whole country by what intelligence and every time even we do it and we find out we'll round up we wind up in a mess and then we feel well we'll get somebody else and lord behold that fail so we have constantly having failure upon the failures upon the failure because the wrong kind of god and god has a remedy god has had provided a way that we can live like we ought to like he wants us to uh to be prosperous that have good health health but we always reject that way you reject the way that god has provided but yet you take what anybody else makes to tell us because god's way is not like our ways god uh sees it in a different avenue and he just don't look at um now present but god look at the future who would you rather listen to somebody that knows what's going to happen at the end or you will just take the good old way now and perish later see we we are failed to listen to the correct god but we got these blind gods intellectually and uh minds that can put things together in all the mechanical way but it still fails but hearing um psalm 38 or 2 and 80 it says uh i like the way it has even read you know because it put not emphasis on uh several men but it said i god's saying i will instruct you i don't know nobody else that i can put my confidence in i don't know nobody else that just don't know what's going on now but he knows the future he knows what's best for us even when we don't even think so god was always right tell me what man you can say that about every man in his best of failure even the best intentions we have of doing the right things and we still fail but if we can just understand that god is is it's got a way made for us i mean because god's way is not like us or like we want it and to please us i say to please the flesh we reject that way because it's a straight way but it's a way that a leads you to glory the bible said many are called and feel chosen another place it says great is the gate you know i i i can't excuse my kids can't for never forget when i heard that and i was in that place and that preacher come church of god and says scrape is the gate and there was something about it i wanted it didn't even know really what i was saying but something in me had to come to a conclusion i tried to live my life a certain kind of way and it became a pure mess a shipwreck and no doubt you don't mean for it to be like that but because it's humanistically nature and this mindset and you know how you were young you think oh i'm i'm gonna enjoy life i'm gonna i'll do this and i'm gonna do that because i want to do it and you'll find out and i hope you'll find out real soon and try not to really try those things but take heed godway is the best no doubt many of you when you're growing up and still yet uh you try to choose a school that you uh feel that can lead guide you in the right direction and that's good to try to get some of the best schools some that got prominent professors and you know and prominent of people that has got a good track record you search it out and you know the instant out of it but did you see god see because what could be good for one person may not be for you see god got something for you god got a way for you to go but when you do it your way you know how we get i'm grown now really are you growner than your creator he knows where you headed that servant of god said there's nothing in your life that you can do that god already don't know every place you go every turn that you make god already know you're gonna do it but he let you choose it watch what you choose see you ought to sit down and and really consider the pros and the cons where is this going to lead me you looking at the natural effects of success and and the riches and the glory or where you can live and what you can have but have you really considered the end of the matter you know i don't know about you but many times i know now we look at our life we said boy if i would only just listen if i would have only just made the right choices you could have been spared for some other thing that you might be going through right now like i told maybe i said but you can't take it back but you can use it as a stepping stone god wants you to be successful god wants you to prosper too because he is in the but it's a way to do it don't just take the educational way of it but see god about it nothing wrong with getting any device but carefully sit down and write the pros and the khan right ahead of that put god first i'll be the bible say seek ye first the kingdom of god and all his righteousness and everything else will be added to you isn't that simple but it's the hardest thing to get us to do too hard isn't it yes well what is hard about it it's our desire but god said there in uh uh 32 he said now i will inscrut thee and teach thee in the way which thou shall go i will god thee with my eye oh my i look at these things now i said lord i you know wish that i would have really took more heed to the things that i've heard and not let them slip but you know i can do something about it now what has in the past is in the past i'm gonna forget those things behind me and i'm gonna press see you we have another opportunity of what we did back there is gone but now you're in a brand new 2020 lord have mercy 2021 if i if you were gonna make a new year resolution call up the costs cut it up think soberly of what am i gonna do with this life god gave me remember that god gave it to you but he gonna let you choose do he already know what you're going to do you know why because you want somebody they made me do it god put adam leaded him on freeway he put the tree of knowledge and good and evil he put life and death right in the same garden he also gave them now don't touch this tree all you will die eat of everything else why was that so hard the curious that curiosity kills the cat it killed the whole human race one woman disbelieved one word and this is why we in the condition let me in right now today reasoning can't just take god for it now it it looked like especially now that if anybody can prove whatever girl tell a lie you have a reason to be able to doubt it but there is no proof nowhere because he knows all things yes you're young you're ambitious that's all right but god's saying seek me first i give you the desires of your heart if you're followed to know me saith the lord have mercy hard age to get the people that believe that god is the best god there is servant of god was sending that message of the god he was saying that god has to be in some states or the state have to select them and they have to be able to sign off if they're going to take somebody out that they're reliable he has to see some kind of proof of they've been trained properly you know to be able to take you out there and to lead you in the right way he has to know that he is responsible for what happens to you he has to know that if the weather get bad off a tornado or something come he has to know where you act he has to be able to track you and approach you in the right direction for safety if something was to go wrong he has to know this he can't get you out there somewhere and say well now what did i tell them and you out there wondering panicking about to die you see that's why god he gave us the best god he didn't leave it in the hand over some man that went to some kind of school or or this or that no he said let's go let's go read that guy a little bit saint john 16. and i'm closing this pandemic and all that we see going on the news and lord have mercy and everything from every way and every angle uh is chaotic because we're relying on the wrong god do what you call blind guides we are trying to make something come back that has been destroyed could the bible say if the foundation has been destroyed where should a godly appear what are we going to do if the fight if you then destroy the what's the founding of something that holds everything up if the foundation had been destroyed what are you building on brother you building upon sinking sand man has come to they're destroying themselves with interventions they want to make it better again and all the signs and everything everywhere all the signs are pointing that it's never coming back no matter what they do they're going to try and all they got spent all that they got to try to make us think that it's going to get better that's why i hear people oh yeah it's 20 21 now and we're gonna have it's a new year and things are going to this depending on what you're looking at are you looking at the count and how people are leaving here daily i've been saying lord sanders but every six minutes or so people are dying lord help us saint john 16 seventh verse through 13. nevertheless i'll tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you see it's a person and when he not them and when he is come he will prove the word of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged you see i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will do what into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall you should hear that shall he speak he will show you things to come your god someone that it's going to lead you into all truth we took it from the natural and we know the natural types of spiritual we need a spiritual god and the servant of god was saying someone that who know where they're going you he knows how to take you there but will you follow they oftentimes say you can lead a horse to the trout but you can't make them drink we can show you by the word where you ought to and where you need to go but no man can make you do it you are the free motion you can choose to say whether i don't want that uh well i'll do that later or maybe you got a better way maybe you are much more smarter than god is maybe you know something that god don't know like eve did uh you know she found out something adam didn't knew found out what she knew that it caused chaos adam knew you what have you done come adam show let me show you in other words what god kept back from us no god told me you don't eat that tree or you're gonna die you know that curiosity is still people have that spirit still living today people always accuse well you know um well i know you know and they'll try to reason maybe you know but everybody else just seemed to be enjoying it and and and seem to be doing well maybe you know ain't nothing happened to them don't realize spiritually they're dead that's why it says that it was better for you not to know the way and to know it and depart from it because we know what we ought to do but seemingly you know i know the hardness of the organization system that you know that people if they had the bishop to make them do it they'll do it because the bishop put some force on them and he tell them heavy but god is a man that's meek and lowly and he said come unto me and i give you rest for your soul you got to come but a jesus said no one can come except the father draw them but how many times have we heard the voice you heard the god voice calling and you understand real well that i found out until i say people can do whatever they want to do if they really want to do it but because of our self-will that we have and a spirit of disobedience we seem to don't want it that way we want it another way but jesus said i am the way the truth into life you know it's strange to see that how that people uh can believe any other man that tells them anything you know for his job wise or even the doctors or or whatever and they can believe what he they say but they can't take what god say and the bible says it means hates his liars but show me where god have a boston it is impossible for god to lie see uh this god here uh he went away and he sent something back that we were gonna need and surely in this hour we need a god i mean a real god that knows what he's doing that knows that if you lost i can guide you back to the path of life but you got to come follow me jesus told him every time he met with him he said come pick up your cross and come follow me see why because he was the god he did they had pharisees in the senate but he said no blind guy he said they did they trying to keep the law but he said i come to fulfill what the law has already spoken of me and they thought jesus was coming with a whole different kind of religion but no it was the very word that they were studying that was spoken of him and he was right there fulfilling it and yet they call him the devil wow what kind of proof they had none but because of their religious standard they had it they knew the scroll abraham of a father moses said jesus said before moses the world abraham was out of hell what is this man talking about he's only 30 something years how can he be before abraham church tonight follow your god which is the holy ghost no matter how much we preach how much we teach you have to have the holy ghost he will lead you but if you follow the instructions that he left you sure to get it but you must follow the god god bless you tonight [Music] god bless amen we thank god for the word and the songs and thank god for each and every one of you to press your way out tonight jesus christ the same yesterday today in favor so where you lead me i'll follow amen and brother and sister if it's ever been a time we need to follow him amen because he'll lead us all the way from earth to glory trying to turn this thing off but that somebody get it praise god god is good amen so by the grace of god we knowing that life here on this earth it's very very short it's like grass i like the flowers it'll fade away in just a short time when you get my age you'll see how short life is and you got to take this time to make the best of every moment but one thing you don't want to do is waste time because time is precious the time that god has given us to live on this earth is very short for he said the days of a man life is three school years and ten and by reading the strength there'll be four school years that time is very valuable what we do with the little time that we have here some felt to sleep it away some folks are drank it away some folks are duck dope it away some folks just have pledges but god didn't give us this life that we have just to throw it away and to waste it gave us life and life is precious but this life here it'll perish but god wants to give us his life and that's zoey god's own life that's eternal and the bible tells us that one day it's what the lord is a thousand years and thousand years is one day brother and sister if you think about it how you waste time how you waste your life you know just praying today just coming out here just praying and crying at the lord and while i'm spraying i just said lord we're wasting time we're wasting this opportunity that we have to live and what are we doing for god how how how successful can we be in life yet we miss the opportunity to serve god's purpose in god's plan and god's will for our lives and all of our trying and all of our doing if it's not god's plan and god's purpose and god's will then the prophet of god says we can try to do god of service without his being his will we got to find out god what will i have me to do and can i serve your purpose i only have a little time that i'm going to be here lord can i amen do it the right way and can i be in your perfect plan and your will lord not my will but let thine be done jesus had a struggle himself and he was god he had a struggle and a battle because he meant amen every devil out of the pits of hell was coming against him and because of the struggle that he had and he was facing death of the cross and he said father if it's possible to let this cup pass but he said nevertheless i got a purpose amen for this hour amen this is why i was born and said i said saving from this hour brother and sister when jesus amen knowing that it's suffering in pain that he was then do he said if it's possible let this compass brother and sister but if it's god's will in god's purpose and is for the good then you we must be willing to suffer to add in in the pain that god's purpose and plan might be in our lives sometimes we don't want to give up our will and our plan and i i what we want and what we want to do we don't want to give it up for god's purpose for we hold to our own will instead of him guiding us we got ourselves instead of him leading us we lead ourselves and we say here it is god it must be good it must be god because god is blessing it it must be god because it's working out brother and sister i'm going to tell you something this path when god takes you down a path this flesh don't want to go down that plan when god has something for you to do i'll tell you it's a struggle and it's a battle to do it because all the devils in hell will try to keep you away from god's plan and purpose for your life but once you amen pass through you're struck on your oh hallelujah when you get there and then you find out hey god i i i i i i i i'm on course now amen but you got to get to amen your struggle and your battle amen how you know sometimes prophet god said when a man want to do something he said 9 out of 10 god didn't call him to do it he said it's only those that don't want to do it he said now look at god's servant moses said when he wanted to do it even he was all wrong he thought he could do it with his own ability but when he came to the point on the back side of the desert and he didn't have any more confidence in himself when he became perfectly weak then he was strong god said now you and your 80s come on i want you to do it now why because it wasn't moses that was going to deliver to god's people it was god gonna do it and moses wasn't gonna get the credit for it are you with me and god wants you to get the glory out of our lives as long as you seek it when moses was strong and moses could do it and had all his intellect oh yeah i can do it but moses had to come to the place where he couldn't do it and we got to come to the place where i can't but nevertheless lord amen once i become to the point that i can't do it oh yes it's a struggle brother and sister every day you know i'm constantly in prayer lord i you know i can't do it yeah amen i can't lead those people i can't sharpen this flock but god i know i can't do it but you can [Music] i'm a failure god and i fail all the time but lord you do it are you with me see brother and sister once we depend on him to do the job it's not about our ability or our ingenuity but it's god's spirit that does the world and we let god do it it'll be done well and we won't get any glory because that's not what we want god you be glorified amen anytime we lift up man amen man is going to come to nothing but when we lift up jesus he said what if i be lifted up if jesus is lifted up he said what i'll draw oh man that's what we want to do i wonder who wonder who who wonder who i wonder who [Music] wonder who wonder who wonder who [Music] jesus wonder who wonder [Music] amen god is good amen just keep on lifting him up when you lift him up amen things are happening they meant demons are cast out amen bodies are healed marriages come together deliverance is here when you lift jesus up amen let us just stand tonight and let us we appreciate god the god

show me the way i god show me the way ah god well you said i am the way show me your god the direction in which i'm to travel for love you in control hallelujah but we are depending on almighty god to move by your spirit and move in our lives lord may you destroy every yoke of the enemy lord god those devils that coming against the marriages isn't coming against the home and coming against the family coming against the children lord we buying up the powers of the enemy lord god the prophet of god said go after them amen god said i give you your children i give you your family and you go after them in the name of jesus we send the holy ghost out to them in jesus name hallelujah god you promised it lord and god we're here standing on your promises you said with your stripes we healed you said i give you your children you said i give you your family in jesus name we lay hold on your word hallelujah what's mad and i claim the victory you're worried amen going out of your mouth it
