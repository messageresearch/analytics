help your children in jesus name amen the book of first kings 18. first kings 18. god is good amen somebody said i love the lord because he heard my cry first kings 18 and 21. and elijah came unto all the people and said how long haunt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if they'll then follow him and the people asking him not a word may god bless the reader's word maybe see the people answered him not a word the 39th verse here same chapter let's just start at the 37th verse 37 hear me o lord hear me and this people may know that thou art the lord god and the thou has turned their hearts back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifices in the wood and the stone and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trenches and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is god the lord he is god the lord he's god amen now we was to talk to you this morning about turning our hearts back again turning your hearts back again our hearts back again amen israel a little theme this morning a sub-topic this morning is how long will you hawk between two opinions how long will you hawk between two opinions see israel was in a backslidden state but in that backsling state they wanted to take heave to the prophets and worshipping the law but at the same time they wanted to please jezebel by worshiping baal are you with me so they had two options they wanted to worship the lord because of the prophets they wanted to worship baal because of jezebel but elijah came on the scene with the word from the lord elijah thought that the status of israel was the prophet of baal was 400 and so but he was standing by himself he was alone because the status of israel we understand that once jeroboam and real born had the conflict jeroboam in israel built the golden calf to keep the people from going back to worship the lord and the people worship the golden calf as they did when they were in the wilderness when they had aaron to build the golden caps that these be our god this is our god that brought us out of egypt so oftentimes that there was then so is it now i was talking to the young people on tuesday and i said how you treat god now is how you would have treated him if you were back there in that day how you worship the lord now if you were in the days of moses you would do the same thing if you were in the days of noah you would do the same thing you will be no different if god does not mean much to you now he wouldn't mean much to you then if you serve god half halfway and you know like you wanna and do like you wanna live like you wanna uh how hawk you between how long will you hawk between two opinions can you make up your mind you're going to serve the lord or not so elijah was giving the people an option i want you to consider what you're going to do are you going to serve your lord or are you going to serve baal and elijah had uh uh i i wanted to demonstrate to you amen which god is real and which god is the living god which god that has the power i need sometimes we every night dead amen the people need to see that god is the lord that god is the lord the god that you're serving amen he is the true and living god so there was a challenge of we call it the calm or showdown it was all about who was gonna win the hearts of the people see sometimes we're backslidden in our hearts and we're actually watching with our own secret uh uh uh uh our own bail worship and we'll are heating taking heat to jezebel teaching so jezebel doctrine now who is the jezebel and who is the baal the god that we bowed on in worship and at the same time we want to please the god in that of the prophets we want the lord and we want to jezebel god we don't want to just give up god we want both often times we look and people want to be in the night club and they want to party and they want to do this and that the pledges of this life they want to have the entertainment i believe that we are so much stuck on entertainment and pledges of this life till we put god on the back burner he's not really amen first in our lives we just saw uh talk about him we're just doing enough for the that say that god you first see you know sometimes we have to amen put away amen the images of baal and the things of this world see uh he said why hulk how long will you hawk between two opinions make up your mind who you gonna serve are you with me but the people had a problem because they thought amen i'm getting along fine because i i i got bailed and i i i i got both and people in the church they think they can have it both ways i think i can do what i want to do and i think that i can do what the lord want me to do brother and sister let me let me look at uh jeremiah for a minute jeremiah 2 and hopefully we're not preaching this morning so hopefully we just talk to you a little bit amen our hearts need to be turned we need to realize that uh that every man thinks that he's right in his own eyes in his own eyes he thinks he's all right but god is not looking at what you think about it because he said your thoughts are not my thoughts the way you think i don't think like that so don't tell me how you think cause god is not concerning how you what you think about it because your thoughts don't matter with god are you with me because in our hearts amen we can't even trust our own heart because jeremiah said the heart is deceitful and desperately wicked who can know it amen so god we must amen allow god to change just so hard of mine he said i'll give you a new spirit and i'll give you a new heart see because your heart ain't good enough for god so god has to give you a new heart and a new spirit and then god said i put my spirit inside of you we must allow god to give us a new heart that our hearts might be turned again turn back to god why you have an opportunity so amen the purpose of the message of the hour was to turn the hearts of the children back into the faith of the apostolic fathers are you with me in other words to turn you back amen to the what the word of god says that man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god the purpose of the word amen that come in this uh the book being opened is to show you the need of you and i amen living by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god it meant that god wants you amen to have the preeminence in our lives god wants to have our all in all leave it god he don't want you ain't meant to uh be in the world and in the church at the same time trying to amen let me see what jeremiah says about it he says go and cry excuse me jeremiah 2 and 11. he said has a nation as an has a nation changed their gods which yet are no gods but my people have changed their what see see what happens is we have changed the glory what my glory amen he says change my glory for that which do not what it won't prompt my glory amen for that which does not profit you know everybody wants to be glorified and amen and they're changing god's glory for that which was not possible amen that's the stuff that people are caught up in and the stuff that they're putting in front of god amen it won't profit it amen i don't care how how how much your house calls and what kind of car you drive i don't care what kind of money you're making seems like something wrong with the minds of man their heart is not all with god amen they can't get enough of amen this kind of glory that the world is offering them some type of uh image that they'll want to put up amen and they were caught up in baal worship amen these are this thing are caught up even in images and glory for man and they're trying they meant to have a false and a counterfeit type of glory we're looking for prestige and image and amen glory for man what are we trying to achieve where are we going what do we want out of life who are you trying to please who do you want to look up to you what you're trying to be what are you seeking after the bible says seek you first the kingdom of god and here's what i i believe amen amen the prophet of god said people are trying to do god a service without it being his will we're so stuck on amen i'm doing something for god you cannot serve god and mammal amen why hawk you between that we're in an age where the church has become lukewarm it's neither hot nor cold amen he said lukewarm i spew you out of my mouth that is the condition of leo seal and that is the condition of most people's lives they're not hot they're not cold they they want to serve bail and they want to serve god but he said why how long will you heart between two opinions make up your mind he says he said i would that you were hot or cold because lukewarm i'll spew you out of my mouth don't talk about amen all of this nonsense it's what's wrong with you that your hearts are not turned amen where is the fire amen elijah said now now i i i want to help y'all make up your mind while y'all standing and you got your mouth wide open and you can't answer me look at huh elijah said how long will i heart between two opinions amen if they'll be god didn't serve him well if the lord if he be god serving and the people asked him not not a word amen because they they had a problem and the problem was i'm all right i ain't got the answer you elijah but the lie just said wait a minute wait a minute y'all don't want to say nothing see a lot of folk want to just uh amen uh play the game i'm not gonna answer i'm not gonna i'm not messing with that amen i don't know what elijah talking about because i love the lord amen but i loved the things that jezebel is offering me too they love to eat at jezebel table you know amen so it was a two-way street as long as i'm in the church i love the law but when i'm in the schoolhouse i'm on the job somewhere i i i i love the world i got friends in the church and i got friends in the world amen it seemed like my friends in the world i'm closer than them then i'm closer to the ones in the church amen not because you come in the building are you in the church but whether you're in the word or not that's your decision as an individual not at the group it's not collected it's not what amen what you see others do that you make up your mind it's you and the lord amen it's whether or not you hawk between two opinions god is not going to ask you amen you did run well who did him to you god's going to say why didn't you do what i told you to do why don't you live the way i told you to live well you know i saw john down the street and i even live in a brother's song song or oh so and so on that ain't got nothing to do with you i heard the prophet joshua said as for me in my house i'm going to serve the law amen joshua was faced with the people hawking between two opinions but he came to the place where amen he made a decision y'all got to choose you this day whom you're gonna serve amen praise god but i made up in my mind for me in my house we're gonna serve god amen you got to be determined that i'm making up in my mind i will serve god amen praise god i don't care what you think about it i'm going to serve god you got to be serious about it amen praise god but it don't take something from god it's going to take a supernatural happening i believe the people have drifted so far away from the lord then it's going to take an elijah spirit it's going to take the fire of god to come on the scene amen in order for the people hard to be turned back praise god it takes a fire to consume the sacrifice so that fire okay jeremiah it says be astonished all ye heavens the 12th verse at this and be horrified horror horribly afraid be very desolate said the lord for my people have committed two evils are you with me the 13th verse it says my people have committed two evils are you with me y'all with me my people have committed two evils let's examine it my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me after all god does for you after where he bought you from after dying on the cross after shedding his precious blood after all god has done for her oh

thing you want to be amen i want to be right with god lord i want to please god come on somebody have you talked to him and ask them about amen what you're doing and have you concerned amen having a cancer let's talk it over jesus let's have amen the prophet of god was talking about leadership and i was just going over that he said a young man amen in leadership he had uh he was religious he said good master what must i do to inherit eternal life he said to my young man he was a young man and jesus loved him because he was religious he kept the commandments his parents raised him upright he said his parents raised him right and he was a nice religious young man but the young man he he he made a decision when he came to jesus and jesus said go sell all you have and give them to the poor and come and follow me he turned on eternal life because he had treasures that he was seeking on the earth and he didn't want to give up the young man maybe the prophet said he may be 18 19 years old and had a lot of stuff going for himself he was a businessman he had he had treasures he had things that were you know he was successful but the decision that he made he chose rather amen to hold on to the things of this life then to follow jesus brother sister i don't know what decision you're making amen whether you're making a decision to hold on to the thing that the world amen and to turn down the leadership of jesus christ and following him well why hawk you between two opinions you got to make a decision what you gonna do brother sister friend what are you doing with your life the decision that that young man made amen he got richer maybe build his barns and one day he said oh so take that ease amen i'm gonna sit down and enjoy all my business transaction and all that i've accumulated and then they came to a point hey it's about food this day your soul is required what prophet of man that gained the whole world a brother sister loses soul whatever the young beggar named ladders desire to crime they fall from the rich man table one day his riches amen he had woke up in hell and the pope back didn't have much but he had the laws amen ladders made the right decision that young boy ain't meant to had this youth all before him that held his success and all he wanted to hold on to that but he wanted to give up god brother sister the decisions that you make today amen the decision that you make in life realize where it's going to take you what prophet is are you with me what is it going to profit you oh lord here it says i gotta i'm closing the musicians can
