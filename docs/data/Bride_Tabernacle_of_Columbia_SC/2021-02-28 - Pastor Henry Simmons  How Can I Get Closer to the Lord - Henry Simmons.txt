you today amen this is the day the lord has made we're rejoicing and we're glad in it ii chronicles 7 and 12 it says ii chronicles 7 and 12. and the lord appeared unto solomon by night and said unto him i've heard thy prayer it's good to let that god hears us even when we think he's not listening he said i've heard thy prayers hallelujah i heard thy prayers i have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice this place brother i want you to point at this place you know what he's talking about i've chosen what this place amen not somewhere off not a building but this place for a house of sacrifice are you with me this is where the sacrifice is gonna come from the house of sacrifice are you with me so you know what you're all about god chose this place for a house of sacrifice come on when you think you're doing too much then you're not sacrificing amen the sacrifice when you go beyond and above amen when it seems like you can't do no more then you oh it's a sacrifice to be here this morning it's a sacrifice to do the things that you know god won when you don't feel like praising the lord make a sacrifice because god chose this house said if i shut up the heavens that there be no rain if i command the locust to divide the land or if i send peasants among the people if what my people which are called by what i'm talking about the bride of jesus christ amen i'm talking about you that's called by his name my people that are called by my name will what humble themselves we don't have enough humility amen we got to humble ourselves and what pray and seek my face and turn from their what then will i hear from heaven and i will forgive their sins and i will what god bless you you may be seated so the question is to god's servant how can we get closer to the lord it was two things that he respond if you want to get closer to the lord he said read your bible and what read your bible and pray amen the bible says pray without ceasing pray always there was a saying that the old timers used to say prayer is the key to the kingdom and faith unlocks the door are you with me prayer is the key to the kingdom faith unlocks the door we've heard many terminologies lord but we understand in this time amen that we must amen uh how can i get closer to the lord we got to become desperate this is a state of desperation the world is in a desperate state because the world sees itself as falling apart amen so people are coming to drastic actions they're getting desperate to try to save the planet they're trying to save the america people are getting desperate and they're doing desperate things amen if the world is getting desperate trying to save a savage amen this little world this country this nation the world is falling apart and people of that scientific world are getting desperate they met the the military world is conducting everything has come in a state of panic amen look at we by the time we climb out of one uh uh disaster there's another coming in amen how much more can we take amen so it goes amen the economy is in desperation people amen if they don't do something to try to help amen uh the unemployment the different things people are getting desperate they're losing amen family members all around amen the churches are getting desperate they can't come amen in the building and some folks are losing out amen but there's a desperation what when you get desperate what do you do amen if i want to get close to the lord i'll read my bible and pray are you with me so i'm saying in the state that we're in amen i i i i i perhaps i could have said my subject is desperation we must become desperate amen but i don't want you to become desperate as though you got to work yourself into desperation or you got to try to get desperate i i believe that amen there's something that's moving and warning us and pushing us amen that we got to get destroyed amen because i got to amen get a word from the lord i got to get some resolve amen i got to get some resolve amen things got to get better amen and they're not going to get better until i get desperate amen i have to see a need that i need if my people they which are called by my name will humble themselves amen and pray i i'm telling you if there ever been a time they amen that we need to pray amen what do i when i pray somebody said pray i will change our condition change things they meant the children of israel amen i believe after 430 years even the bondage and the tax masters things got rough amen they got amen they really got tough in egypt so the people cried out to god god amen you see what pharaoh is doing you see our condition amen god oh hallelujah we're your people lord and you said that you'll deliver us lord but lord look like our bondage is getting amen magnified they're doing all it can do to try to destroy us oh i believe they cried a little louder they met they knew amen that god promised deliverance and amen i believe that uh pharaoh tried to kill all the firstborn amen and i i know amen the devil amen uh amen got all kind of plans to destroy you all kind of plans how can he kill you because he knows that there's a purpose for your life he know that god amen is going to use you in a greater way he knew amen that amen satan has a short time amen he knew that he meant somewhere amen uh herod learned that jesus shaman he they said why is he that is born king of the jews and he was searching out trying to find that child he told a wise man when you find him come back and tell me that i want to come and worship him too amen but i want you to know amen that when the devil knows amen that this is the season in the time that the bride will step out on the scene then the devil's seeking how he may devour you he's seeking how he can destroy you amen but i believe in that our god he meant steps on the scene amen and gives a dream tell lament joseph get out of this land going to egypt hallelujah i believe at the time of the exodus out of egypt i believe that it was time for the children of israel amen in goshen land to apply to blood amen it's time for you and i they meant to recognize that we're in desperate times we end times well amen if we ever needed prayer before we need prayer now hallelujah glory to jesus the saying is is the family that prays together stays together amen and i wonder amen the church that prays together stays together praise god you know i i i i'm just trying to come to resolve what is the problem why aren't we further up the road as individuals in our lives amen then we got to amen see what it takes for us to get closer to the lord amen if the god servant is right then read the bible and pray amen if you're not reading your bible and praying amen then we understand why you're not closer to the law amen but i said if you want to be closest to the lord then he said i want you to pray pray without ceasing pray always amen pray oh pray when you don't feel like praying amen now ephesians 6 says here glory to jesus i know a lot of times amen we want to just lay down and just go to bed and just get up and forget we got in such a big rush to get to work get on our job we sleep a little longer than we supposed to sleep we come to church amen just when the doors are open we don't recognize what the servant of god said come a half hour early get the atmosphere created and when we come in half an hour early we we don't pray amen we just half an hour earlier wasting time amen but we need to be more functional amen more spiritual to get closer to the lord read your bible and pray amen pray don't come to church looking for you know this and that come looking for god come create an atmosphere god i want you to move amen thank god amen this morning for worship this morning thank god for those that are singing and praising god thank god sister lisa thank god brother go thank god amen sister dale thank you hallelujah god is good we come to worship the lord we come to praise god hey we may not have this chance oh lord see how the doors were shut they meant praise god the squeeze might come at any time amen we may not have the time to come to the house of the lord why we got this time amen though we got mass on and all of that but let's praise the lord while we got a chance amen oh god ephesians uh six he says uh you know uh concerning putting on the whole arm of god that would really be able to stand against the walls of the devil amen we know amen god told us amen to put on the whole lawn he said in the 17th verse he said take the heaven of salvation which and the swold of the spirit which is the what see it's a read your bibles and pray the word of god the heaven of salvation amen get something to cover your head this is headship time amen the heaven of salvation amen on the sword of the spirit which is the what which is the word of god the sword of the spirit is the word of god and it'll it'll kill every demon every devil so use your word read your bible and pray amen pray in the spirit amen well not you praying but it's the holy ghost to make his intercession for us we're growing that cannot be uttered when the holy ghost can take over your prayer and you ain't praying no more it's the spirit making the intercession for us amen have you ever amen let the spirit take over your prayer it's not you you know when you're praying sometimes you get tired sometimes you start sleeping and all kind of stuff but when he takes over amen your prize is unlimited you don't get tired you don't get worried why because when the spirit takes over he be called a name that you ain't called in 20 years are you with me it's praying for folk that you know don't love you don't like you and doing everything that can or gets you but when the spirit takes over they make you praying for them and you wonder where it's coming from but it's coming from the spirit that you make an intercession for them hallelujah praise god you're praying amen for those that are in authority are you with me you're praying for the congressman the senators and the presidents and all of that praying without ceasing amen because the holy ghost took over amen you ran amen but it's not you praying it's the spirit praying amen make an intercession amen hallelujah when the spirit takes over brothers and sisters it's b you you listening to amen that prayer amen so how many times you ever wanted to record your prayer you said i sure wish i had a tape recorder where i can record this you know say because you know i mean you cut you discovering things amen and you understand the things because the spirit is talking to you the spirit is speaking you know sometimes if you don't have amen a life of prayer and you don't learn to communicate with god then you really amen don't take the opportunity as a child of god amen to ask god for what you will and see won't he do it amen because your prize is accent amen he said seek and you shall find not acts and it shall be what given amen acts amen but we don't want we don't act but we expect to get but to be given but we never ask god for it amen acts and it shall be given sometimes we don't we don't have enough faith amen but god's servant said when the weak is saying amen when they get down on their knees to pray i'm talking about weak when you're so weak you the least of them all when you begin to get on your knees and pray it caused the devil to what tremble oh you would be you say well i i i i'm just i ain't nobody i i'm not even always right but you might be weak but i dare you to get on your knees and pray in your weakness the bible says he is what he's strong when i'm weak then he's strong and see the devil is just tempting you he don't want you to talk to god he don't want you to communicate with god that you ever know amen that if in that praise god hallelujah if you pray and read your bible you're going to be closer to the lord amen the devil you know it may not take you but uh uh uh 15 minutes amen the the pray and read your bible and then you know once you start loving it your 15 minutes turn into half an hour and your half an hour turn into an hour and then next thing you know you're a proud warrior and you're communicating with god you say heaven isn't this good how many of you ever walk out got up out of a prayer and say oh lord amen you felt so good you felt so oh lord amen and you you know you once you build that kind of relationship and you lose it then you miss you miss your communication you fall in love with god and you know amen you and god got uh a thing going on you and god got something going on you and god amen praise god you in love with god you love him so you want to communicate you want to talk to him amen that's what i like what brother fred said amen amen his testimony amen praise god so i i want you you got to have a communication with god you got to know that god talked to you god amen he communicates amen and you know if you know god is god amen he don't never change amen if he can talk to them in the bible he can talk to you because you're in the bible are you with me but sometimes we don't talk to god we talk to one another and we fail to talk to god amen i believe we ought to spend more time talking to god than talking to one another and we spend more time talking to god because sometimes people try to interpret what you meant when what you saying you know what i'm saying people spend so much time analyzing why did the why did they sing that song why did he preach that sermon why did he say that why uh i don't know why he said it i don't know why she you know the word is not to why amen if god is speaking to you you say thank the lord he wasn't saying nothing to you you just said pray for him amen because you're talking to somebody else what if he's talking to you you say amen lord thank you lord are you with me but you trying to analyze why you said that renee said you said to somebody else they got it i don't know how many times i walked off the pulpit and i said something and i said why did i say that i didn't mean to say that and then when i walk out the pool a bit somebody said well you know lord spoke directly to me i said thank you lord and i you know and it happened all the time when i'm on the road preaching out evangelizing and stuff and i i i and all of a sudden i leave my the message and i started dealing with stuff and then i said oh lord and then when i walk off the pastor said how do you know all of this stuff i said i need to know nothing amen but the holy ghost knows what we need amen so by the grace of god god sometimes he when we come to church amen don't try to analyze what the preacher is saying amen but when you get a critical spirit to you everything everything is to be criticized and analyzed and amen and then that's what preaching is all about that is not what the pastor and what the ministry of fivefold ministry is about they're here to preach the word and when they're preaching the word amen then the holy ghost is saying things to the people it's got not have nothing to do with you this time but you wait a little while he gets to you are you with me because we all need amen the word of god are you with me so it's the word that gives us life and if we're not the word of god we will not live but if we want to live it takes a word so i i said ephesians 6 he says uh in 12 i don't know what i read about it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world amen so that's if you realize what you working against what you're wrestling against then you'll pray i try to get the young people to understand you know a lot of times you think you're wrestling against what somebody said about you what somebody did to you you're not wrestling against that it's spiritual wickedness in high places you'll know that a lot of times before a war start the wall takes place in the spirit realm and those demons begin to possess people to do certain things are you with me and the devil he would get in people to inspire them to go to war at one another are you with me and he does that to nations and the principalities and powers and the kings and the kingdoms amen so the devil would come into your house and come into your home and he would have anoint spirits to divide and cause havoc he comes into the church and he anoints spirits to amen to keep the people divided a kingdom divided against itself cannot work stan a house divided against itself cannot work stand isn't that right but how do you pull together in spite of what's going on amen read your bible and what pray and if you pray amen you'll find out that god can speak through your prayer and he can identify situations that you didn't know nothing of amen the thing that most of us got to discover we got to discover our weaknesses and when we discover how weak we are then we'll realize amen that i as an individual need help from god you know i got so many things going on with me as an individual till i don't have time to look outside at other folks you with me because when i pay attention to other folks then my house is you know what i'm saying you know when you so visit worrying about other folk house then you forget about your own children that got all kind of problems thing going on with them you can't see them worrying about my my sister children there's some bad children oh no my sis my brother children i'll tell you they need to do this what about yours amen and they crying out mommy i need you daddy i need you but you so busy looking at other folks are you with me see that's why i said sometimes when you you can be god they may give you word in season for your your present distress amen it doesn't matter what the church does go over january and over on this your present is stretched god you need something from god for you amen that's why amen he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers and that pastor amen it's got to get a word for you amen it doesn't matter who you listen to or not what kind of voices you hear but the word for you to feed the church of god which is purchased with your own blood i'm gonna tell you something i'm gonna take it oh i i i don't want to get off into something let me go on and read uh what i wanted to read the 13th verse no let's just let's just go on 18th verse praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there into with all perseverance and supplication for all saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mysteries of the gospel see paul realized that he needed he needed prayer he needed you to pray for him amen if paul needed you to pray for him i need you to pray for me are you with me that utterance may be given that i can open my mouth boldly are you with me and that's what is needed you it's not enough for me to identify or see somebody's weakness it's enough for me when i see that i can get on my knees and start crying out for my brother convinced and concerned are you with me if you have concern for your brother your sister you get on your knees and you pray for them if you don't care you're gonna run your mouth and talk about them and back by them and all kind of stuff you'll never go to them and never try to get anything straight now i can't have it that can't help lord have mercy that's just an excuse for that devil just to have you i i tried i tried 100 times how many times did you try 70 times 70 i got if you tried five times well i tried two times i tried three times 70 times what a day are you up man see brother sister don't never give up on your brother and sister so quick because god could have gave up on you he can give up on you today you think that you're so big and so bad and you're so righteous and so holy that you don't have to go to your brother 70 times 70. i know i didn't went to them and they ain't did nothing i didn't win did god tell you to stop well i just told i told sisters on so-called said they went to them too and so and someone said they went to him too and so and someone said that's the way they are see what i'm saying go spreading all that garbage and
