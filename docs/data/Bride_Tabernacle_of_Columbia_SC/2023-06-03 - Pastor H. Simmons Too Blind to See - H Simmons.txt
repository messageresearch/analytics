tonight Lord with your word father I thank you today in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen the book of The Second Kings sixth chapter 11th verse 6 and 11. Second Kings sixth chapter the eleventh verse and therefore the heart of the king of Syria were sure trouble for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye show me which of us is for the king of Israel and one of his servants said none my Lord O King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel tells the king of Israel the words that thou speak it in thy bed chamber and he said go and spy where he is that I may sin and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in Dalton therefore sin he did the horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and can pass the city around about and when the Servants of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold and holds can pass the city both with horses and chariots and his servants said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elisha praying and said Lord I pray thee thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha Alicia God bless you read this word you may received it oftentimes we walk by sight not by faith so and oftentimes we the world has its way of blinding us and the world had his mind as the song says I was blind but now I see so we're talking about too blind to see and if you was reading the unveiling of God you'll see a lot of times the prophet we're stalking him out to blind to see so two by two blind is C oftentimes what the devil shows us is different from what God shows us but because it was the way we were born to contact this Earthly place with here tasty and feel and touch and so I mean those five senses amen now I want to go to Genesis 3. the devil is doing the same thing he ever did Jesus Christ is same yesterday and today and forever the devil is ever the same too as he said there's nothing new Under the Sun the schemes and the tricks and deception that the devil used you know in Genesis and all through the Bible he's still using those same tactics and you know who's falling fun the same kind of people are falling for the same schemes and tricks of the devil those that said I would I would have believed then and don't believe now the people that don't believe nine would have been back there if you put them back there they would have done the same thing that those people did so by the grace of God as I was saying in uh something on Wednesday about the days of law said it was a time where only eight Souls were saved just say when the whole world so if it was that close then we ought to take the most Earnest Heap to Think Through Hillary at least in any time when she letting them slip God is a serious God and our journey to heaven God wants y'all to I mean we want us to really recognize that this thing is going to thin out as we approach the end time it's going to be very few people that want God the devil is is he blind in the beginning he's going to Blind many today because where their hearts ain't in it well your tragedy is that will your heart be also their hearts and their minds said in Genesis was continually evil that's what they were they had their mind the devil had successfully blinded the mind of the people in Genesis and he successfully blinded the mind now of the whole entire world has been hoodwinked has been blinded by the devil alone don't you think that he would not come into Brian Tabernacle or into any Church no matter what his bride or message or whatever the devil is still working but God is so not willing than any should perish but it all should come to repentance but the prophet God said if we're blind it's because it's our choice he blind Israel for our sakes are you with me for our sakes he blinded them but if we are blind it's because we want to be blind are you with me so here in Genesis 3 now the serpent was more subtle than in any beast of the field which the Lord God made and he said unto the woman yea has God said you should not eat of every tree of the god you know your flesh don't want God your flesh does not want God so so you're not expecting to please your flesh you have to battle and you have to fight just to be in the house of the Lord and you have to fight to pray the Lord because your faith your flesh will never want to praise the Lord your flesh would never want to lift Jesus up your flesh would always want to dishonor disrespect God you don't know which what time it would be when your mind and your heart will be so darkened that you would not be able to see God you don't know what hour it'll come because as much as God loved Adam and Eve he yet gave them a choice of what they you gave them made them free moral agents and you have a choice you can do right or you can do wrong but you know it's not many make the right choice the reason why because it's not in man to make the right choice it's just the mercy of God and the grace of God it's the grace of God that we can see the word and love God it's not P many people that's going to love God there's not many people in this day in this age it's going to really carry anything about God because God is not important to their lives this is to Here and Now God is not important they don't even want God the world don't love God don't want God and they feel like they don't need God but here that same devil you know if that's not a hungry that's not a love I want God if your mind is just so blank and so void and so dull that there's no that you don't even listen to the word you don't never open your Bible you don't never really want to pay attention in churches all we want to do is get up and walk and walk in prancing you know we don't even care we don't get serious about God our mind just you printing out fingernails and yeah it doesn't matter I don't care but once we find out I'm serious about God lord it's you that I'm on and when I come to your house I'm arning you and I want to I want my soul to be fed I want something that anchored me I want you to speak to me that's why we come early and kind of get in proud and that's no more early coming and getting in prayer anymore people don't do that no more we just don't come early and get in prayer we come late and we're ready to go on time you know what I'm saying come early get in prayer expecting God to move Lord let me get all of this that I've been through the day out from me Lord I want to just settle down and I just want to relax and try to get in the mood of the spirit where we come just in time you know not knowing we got to get our thoughts our mind right up Spirits right and kind of mellow down and said Lord I need you speak to my heart we come to a place that we are we expecting to hear from God are we expecting a word from the Lord are we just going through the motion of traditional worship and coming to church but when we come with the unexpectation that I want to hear something that Lord I'm going through some stuff those are the times we want to hear God only when we're in trouble we want to hear God I was reading today a Christian psychologist and he was telling about his battle with being an agnostic and um he was saying in his battle uh uh uh not because he he was telling how people become atheists how you say the 80s 80s and how they become agnostic and he said it's you that come into childhood it's usually in childhood time and it's usually it's what they see in the home and uh and they say it's usually the battle within the home causes that them to come in doubt of God so he said in adolescence usually the people the children are battling and trying to get to know whether God is real it wasn't not they're trying to get in contact they're trying to understand in adolescent age he said that's when he had his greatest battles took him a long time in life to find out God define God so he was talking about finding God in the battles that he went through whether to believe that God was real or was it God exists and if God did exist why is all this turmoil in the world and he could not understand he could not understand all the stuff what's going on why is life so chaotic why so confusing what is the purpose of it I think we all go through that especially in adolescence you know if you hadn't then thank you but a lot of times we we're searching and seeking and wanting to find God but he says sometimes it's what we see in the home those that supposed to know God sometimes it's a loving home sometimes it's one way and that way and they get confused one going this way and the other going that way it kind of confused the children they don't know what the the god that they hear in the Bible the god that's preached that sometimes they're looking to see that they're looking to see that God in their parents they want to see God they want to see the god that people talk about in the church they want to see that God in people's lives so let me go on I I got caught up in that but here the a lot of a lot of things in life blind so blind but here the devil look at the tactics of the Devil look at how what he does to Blind your mind see all he wants to do is get your mind twisted up tangled up messed up and then he knows when he got you in confusion the Bible said God is not the author or what confusion the devil knows when he can get you confused that he got you but he said he gives them perfect what peace and that's what uh you know I I I started this style my top of this uh uh peace perfect peace because what what people need now is to have peace amen but they can't have peace when they don't trust God the neither can they you know ah you know it's something that that the psychologist said he said that a woman lost their child and when they lost the child they came and you know he was you know it was she was grieving and in her grief she said that I all my praying all my living right all my doing this all that and God took my child and God you know I don't understand and why why me why did God do this to me and she was she was so out of it he said most of the time you can't help that person that blame God for all their troubles he said it's hard to help somebody who started blaming God for their troubles and not understanding God see first of all the god that most people worship is the god that gives them all the things they want as long as life is going pretty good he said that's the kind of the god that people have in their mind but when things don't go their way then they don't believe God no more they don't trust God no more because things ain't going their way a lot of folk just turn their back that's it I ain't God ain't real but of God that gives them what they want and that's the kind of God they want to serve so a lot of times I find that it be the truth people have difficult times coming to church if everything ain't going like they wanted to go they have difficult time believing the preachers the preacher ain't saying what they want to hear they have difficult times in school difficult times to live in life peace is not there but when they come down and that's why it says too blind to see if we're going to believe God we're going to believe God by faith if we gonna by faith in God we've got to believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them they're dealing seeking if we're going to see God we're going to see him by faith amen not by what what happened what kind of experience we had in life we're going to see him by faith amen we're going to the god that uh that that we see by faith in the god that we trust in amen he's going to work things out good no matter how difficult it is oh you look man but we got to know that come in contact with that God and he's got he got to become real to us that God if you're not we're going to bite our fingernails and we our mind gonna be all wear off somewhere he'll never get y'all what we can hear we come to church when we can't we don't hear God we go through the motion we sing about him but we can't hear we can't experience him we talk about it we try to make ourselves believe and that's what he was saying it's a lot of talk a lot of talk but God is not really real to them they have not he said he says there's so many talk what themselves up and talk about to talk and be real religious he said they pray all the time it's just like that woman praying all the time she she prayed she did everything she was supposed to do but when things didn't go her way [Music] um that's the way it is our reaction when things are not going the way we think it ought to go oh you're talking about somebody that could uh bring Habit to the church and chaos a person that is disciplined things ain't going their way are you with me and something happened you know that they don't think it's supposed to happen oh Lord you got a problem and that's what just as much as people can get go Haywire a husband go hey wow and wife right now and children can battle one another and all of that people do God just as they do one another they do God that's denica same way and that but they don't know it he said have you done it to the least of these you've done it to me how can you love God whom you're not seeing and hate your brother who you see isn't that right see a lot of times we don't know that there are spirits that are Fallen Angels just as those angels that will that Eli Elijah those saw there are falling angels that are here to accomplish their job those angels uh that that are Fallen amen they are there to press themselves into your mind and into your life that you may do their will that's another thing we was talking about those angels those Fallen Angels where did it go they're looking for somebody to dwell in a woman they're not all Angels nobody called demons and devils are you up man and if you don't want God in there you got you're going to have demons and devils and those Devils gonna lead you down the path and they're gonna lead you to the things of the world and if you don't want God you're gonna have something you're gonna have demons devils and they're going to lead you now on the path of destruction are you with me but people are satisfied with old spirits just like the prophet the man what's up there beating up the preachers and breaking them up and and then he casted the devil out and fell on his feet and said this is healed and the prophet says no is it is it dead no is it here no he said what is it he said the man loved those spirits if the man love those Spirits you know you can cast it out but he's coming right back and to you won't do you want you don't want those spirits but a lot of times people are satisfied with being like they are because this is me you got to die to yourself daily you got to stop being you you're satisfying and content with being you but God does not want you to be you are you with me God don't like you amen you you know amen your flesh cannot please God your flesh shall not love God it's enmity against God and it does not want to obey God at all so where you are this is me God don't want you God is asking you to take up your cross and follow me I want you dead the only way Christ can live Paul says I Die daily and as long as you die to yourself Christ can live but if you were satisfied being no own little special person and your little attitude of thinking that you are special glad you are God don't want it are you a man see Christ is wanting you to look in the miracle and you got to see Jesus in the mirror not you are you with me because as long as you see you it's things that you got to commodify things got to be crucified amen all right that's why Paul says you know I pressurize the mark of the prize of the High Calling we're too we're too into ourselves and think that we are really Christians we're really soldiers of the Cross you're lying to yourself and that's why you can't have the joy uh and the peace that God wants you to have is because amen we we can tell ourselves lies make ourselves feel like we can have joy outside of God that's only an invitation of will Joy that's the only invitation of real peace that's not really amen Jesus said my peace I give you not as the world give give I you the joy that God gives you amen is the joy that's in the Holy Ghost the joy of the Lord is by strength Amen to see God move in our lives and see God keep us to see God bless us to see the things that God does for us well that's what made me excited amen this afternoon as I meditated on the Lord when I got excited about is that God got so many blessings that He blesses with yet we choose to get what the devil is off enough not knowing that God blessings are far beyond amen God Amen his joy unspeakable and full of Glory but you'll never experience it as long as you listen to what the devil said as long as you believe the devil's lies you'll never experience the joy of the Lord you'll never be at peace because you think that you're gonna get it on your own you think you're gonna get happiness and you're gonna make it through life and without God I'm gonna tell you something you're lying to yourself if life can become miserable it can become difficult without God amen I'm talking to somebody and that's what people struggling with the woman let me go back here to this I got I got the clothes because I didn't mean to be long tonight but uh in the woman saw a woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said you should not what eat of it need to show you what least you what and the serpent said unto the woman you should not well let me tell you the devil is speaking to you you can do what you want you got time you can do exactly what you want you got time you'll get God after a while I wish I could bring a bathroom and set it in the middle everybody just seen the walk walk I'll tell you and if I don't say nothing people will keep walking if I said something people will still keep walking so we're gonna do me no good to say nothing because people are gonna walk I know the lord the devil is fighting you know but I understand see the genuine the devil will make everybody walk y'all know we got to walk in this church in America they're walking this church in America the number one walk in this church that means we got to pray these Devils out of him because folk walk soon the word come forward go to walking are you with me the walk-in grows and I'm gonna tell you something you got to Cal calm down pray hold it y'all have been on the road and you had to hold it until you get to the rest stop or somewhere holy sometimes you'll find out what number to lie anyway the trick of the devil it wasn't even important are you with me when I said that at genuine need came up you see what I'm saying but you see I gotta go but let y'all know the story I don't have to read the scripture do I y'all know what the devil did to Eve right he added to see what he wanted him to see you know that same devil telling you what you're seeing what you this is what you want don't you don't you see the tree you see this right here you see that the devil is taking you away from God he's still showing you stuff and you say yo your eyes will be open that's what the day I will tell you you know no the devil the God trying to keep you away from something isn't that right and the devil is convincing people now he's using the same tactic why do you think these young people go out here and experience these things man take a hit off this joint man take a little swag off of this alcohol man going with this girl here like you all kind of stuff people are all experiencing all kind of stuff because the devil haven't so deceived and so blind today believe the devil lie and don't know that they're gonna die don't know that they're gonna go to I don't want to say it but I better say it because the depth you know wait a minute in heaven where'd he end up in where he said it I didn't see it okay so the devil knows that he can talk you out of your blessings see that's what the devil does he talked people out of their blessings God is is blessing abundantly modernly but the devil want to talk you on your blessings don't let the God give you a gift the devil talk you out of that gift don't let the Lord be using you to witness that they're able to talk you out of that if you stand for God God got so many blessings for you God want to use your spottedly but the devil don't want you to be used by God the devil want to mess your life up amen the devil doesn't mess so many lives up that we ought to have sense enough not to believe him but yet we find ourselves still believing the devil eyes came on me David didn't didn't the devil tell her eyes if they feel first God didn't know then in the day you eat there are your eyes or what Eli shall be open and I'ma tell you something your eyes show gonna be open if you don't listen to God in a hurry you don't get your praying in a hurry your eyes show gonna be open in a few days you'll find out that people's eyes gonna be open you say oh I didn't know she was gonna do that oh I didn't know he was gonna do that yeah he's gonna do it because he set up here and let the devil blind them said in the church didn't listen to Mama didn't listen to daddy didn't listen to Teresa didn't listen to nobody and the eyes got blind yeah they didn't listen good here why I want to do hey yo girl what nobody say I want to do so and so yeah you want to do it who introduced you to it where do you get that thought from where do you get that desire from did it come from above or from beneath doesn't line up with God's desire for your life would it please God for that what you want to do will it please God and will it please you are you up there see because if you're going to please God you're going to say God I want to do your will I want to do what you want me to do I don't want to do my own thing I want to do what God wants me to do amen let your will be done in my life that's what I want amen that the devil would oh come on your eyes will be open see and every sickness every death oh sorrow every pain is because what Eve believed the devil was la are you with me and I'm gonna tell you that same devil if he got hit working on you you're working on me you're working on all of us amen all you got to do is let your guard down and the devil got you are you up man and even at that sometimes he does get us for a moment to God have mercy on our soul don't it and we come to ourselves and ask God to forgive us get back on our knees and ask God to put us back in in in in the right spirit in the right mind amen the devil amen somebody said you might fall seven times but you got to get get back up you don't stay down there praise God never think you're so high always amen I'd rather Lord I need more of you than think I got everything praise God don't let the devil lie to you think you are further up the road than you are you know what I'm saying sometimes those reach all to lead people alone man that the preacher don't bother you the devil's Gonna Get You are you up there oh nobody knows what are you talking about you better let him talk you better let the preacher talk cause the devil's show talking are you with me and the devil shows or take your children do something yeah take them through something the devil got a plan for each and every one of your lives but God wants his plan to be done his will to be done are you with me I said I was going to be sure but don't you see her eyes are open but not in the right way get hazel I mean Elijah's servant eyes will open you can see the angels and that's what I saw I saw look at all these blessings God got for us the angels of God right there can't feel about us God said light yourself in the Lord I give you desires of your heart but you say I I I I I I won't do this I want that God said don't don't do that stay up I didn't mean my word abide in you and you can ask what you will and I'll do it but you said no no I can get it myself I don't want to buy it I'm gonna step outside from behind the word when you step from behind the word the devil got you you're fortified behind the word but if you step outside the devil got you you got a state guarded amen keep your God up amen put on the whole armor God you're able to stand against the tricks of the devil the wives of the devil are you with me but when you step from behind that word the devil's gonna beat you to pieces I'm gonna tell you something we're on this Earth for a little while and while we're here we got one purpose in mind that we want to serve the Lord the worship God God I I do all these things extra these these little things on the side but my my real purpose is to serve the Lord I know we might go to work for eight hours go to school fade out but I'm saying your real purpose is Amen to Worship the Lord when you when you're on the job say thank you Jesus amen can I find somebody to tell about the goodness of the Lord how good God is to me where he bought me from what he done for me praise God but if you stop amen witnessing for God you're going to start witnessing for the devil if you're ashamed of God they make you sure ain't gonna be ashamed of the devil are you with me you can't serve two masters the devil took her to the side and he blinded her good didn't he he deceived her so much and so she said Adam this thing was so good I want you to have it this fruit are you with me and Adam knew better are you with me when you see somebody doing wrong and you know better why you gonna do it we know that
