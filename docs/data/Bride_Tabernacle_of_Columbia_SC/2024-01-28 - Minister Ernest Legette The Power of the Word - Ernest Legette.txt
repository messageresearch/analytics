amen God is good amen thank the Lord this morning we want to look at a book of Isaiah by the grace of God Isaiah 55 we'll begin at the seventh verse we want to talk this morning by the grace of God just for few moments on the power of the word amen the power of the word Isaiah 55 and 7 you got it say amen and it reads let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon Him aren't you glad for the mercies of God and to our God for he will abundantly pardon you may be seated read a little further down for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not to thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it to bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sord and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whether where to I sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace and the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands and instead of thorn of the thorn shall come up the fur tree and instead of the Briar shall come up the Myrtle tree and and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off amen God is good ain't I want to read from one other scripture Hebrew 6 by the grace of God we talking about the power of the word this morning amen aren't you glad that God mercies endure forever amen I was thinking on that the other day I I was saying Lord I I I I was saying to myself I heard of your mercies but now I know of about them I heard of your mercies but now I know amen you know you think about what the Lord has has done for you and where he's brought you from and you say I heard heard of your mercies and your Graces but now I know of it amen when he takes you back in your mind or just where he brought you from amen I was sharing brother Simmons the other night I saying you know I was just going back in my mind of when the Lord first save me and and how I went to the same corners and the same places where I used to hang out and uh to the same people same group and and I was witnessing to him I as to car my Bible walking those same places I said I says you know trying to tell them what God has did for me said majority of people thought I was I was Looney crazy like or either thought it was something that was just going to pass on right but I said if they had only know knew back then what the Lord what I knew what I found out if they only knew and and could have accepted and and came on you know back then I says you know I started naming some names I said you know looking at the lives this one dead and gone that one dead and gone that look at the Hard lives and struggles and all the things that the hard lives I said that it didn't have to be that way I said they only knew they only knew back then what God could have done for them or would have done for them I says but I thank God for election amen you know and that's the thing about it if we only knew know sometimes just what God wants to do for you A lot of times you go through people go through unnecessary suffering necessary things don't have to just from not uh listening to God or not coming to him when he call you but I said if you only know that God what he wants to do for you I believe it was uh uh Jeremiah was saying his proph sign he was saying you know you forsaken the The Fountains of Living Waters you forsaken those Fountains of everlasting or Living Waters and he says and and have he heun yourself out sisters broken sisters but you forsaken the Fountain of Life come on he's a Fountain of Life y'all believe that this morning come on he's he's not just a well like that but it is a living water springing up in you he's a Fountain of Life I said if if you only they only would have knew of you or if you you this morning only that haven't tasted only would knew know what God wants to do for you in your life now you go through uh uh trials and tribulations but in all of that God going to see you through because it's only for character building process anyway because God is bringing you into maturity but I said if you only knew if you only know just uh what God wants to do for you those hard nights that you face all alone if you only know you didn't have to face them by yourself amen yes those trials and situations if you only know you ain't got to face them by yourself come on somebody want to walk there with you and lead you through those Dark Hours come on David said he he leadth me come on through the valley and the shadow of death God want to lead you through those places if you only know you don't have to face those battles alone you don't have to face those trials those sicknesses all those things on on alone you don't have to face them alone God want to walk in there with you if you only know hallelujah oh Jesus Hebrews 6 by the grace of God Hebrews 6 and we'll begin at the want to begin at the 12th verse amen let's begin at the 13th verse and he says for When God Made made promise to Abraham because he couldn't swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable immutable things in which it is impossible for God to tell a lie how many glad for that this morning I said it's impossible for God to tell a lie so the things that God spoke toward uh concerning you and I it is impossible for God to tell a lie amen come on our faith we might not believe it and it might hold it up but it is impossible for God to tell a lie Hallelujah so he says we might have or as apostle for God to tell a li we might have strong consol who have fled for Refuge should lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest Forever After the order of MDC may God had a blessed to the reading of his word this morning we says we want to just talk for a moment and that's something that the Lord just put on my heart and I was meditating on it for a while now it's it's just the power of the word amen just how much life is in the word you know we know that the the letter kills but the spirit giveth life but it's so much life in the word you know you know when you reading the Bible it's not just some the book that you're reading but it's life in that book it's power in that book and the Devils know that too don't they and that's why they they try to keep you away from that and being down on your knees in prayer because it's it's power in the word of God hallelujah when you read the word it's it's things in the word that just lift you up out of whatever you going through you you say Lord I need a word but God always send a word to lift you up out of of that what you in you know I was thinking about that and that's what it is when we talk about the power of the word you know it's something about God's word Can't Fail none of his words will fall to the ground and and won't accomplish that which he sent it to do but he said just as the you know the water rain falleth unto the earth and the snow it's got a purpose in it don't it he says to bring forth seed to bring forth bread all those things and to nourish it it it's got a purpose and that purpose is a powerful purpose right he and it falls because it falls and it does the job of what it was intended to do so he just used that he says but even as that is that way so my word is come on he says it left my my mouth and it ain't going to return unto me void what I sent it to do it'll do what I sent it to do and the devil that's why I like that saying that I think brother Jackson was saying the other night you are what the word says about you come on you are what the word says about you that's what you are you might not feel it yourself you might not believe it yourself but what the word says about you that's what you are because God cannot lie come on God can't lie his word you know you you think about what you walking in what are you walking in you walking in the favor of God ain't you you blessed because God says you blessed come on I was saying the other week who God bless is blessed ain't they and who God curs is cursed right come on because God you can't you can't alter God's word you know I I was reading the other day where it says well a man rob God right he says and how will you rob me he said in tithes and offerings Malachi 3 he says in tithes and offerings he's talking about how you know you curse with a curse when you rob him right no matter how much you try to bless yourself or people try to bless you you cursed with a curse why because you rob God right but on the other hand he says try me he says bring them to the storehouse and says and see won I bless you come on he says see w i open up the windows of heaven and pour out blessings upon you come on you blessed Hallelujah and that's the thing about it God's word can't fall to the ground can it come on he says try me Hallelujah but we find that I says that that God's word is is uh powerful he says you know I like how here and I don't know how really we're going to get it but it says here in uh Hebrews 6 you know he's speaking to Abraham I mean you know we know it was in Genesis but here Paul going back over it again he says you know about the promise that God made Abraham right and it was because of his faithfulness right God made him a promise because Abraham had came to a point in his life to where he would do anything that God required of him he was uh God asked him to come out from among his Kindred he came out didn't he God told him I'm bless you even after the blessing God told him to give them back to me and he was willing to do that right but he begin to say in blessing I'mma bless you come on I'm going multiply you not only you but your seed after you right and so we know that that it's a blessing just was the blessing was just on the natural seed wasn't it come on and just because he blessed the their fathers the the blessing was on the children right now we know that a lot of times the children would get out of the way and God God would have to punish them right but nevertheless even though he punish he would punish them that would be only to get them back in line to what the word of God says back into the line so therefore he can continue to bless them amen right and that's what God you know uh we being a Seed of Abraham is the Bible says in Galatians 3 you know if we be Christ then we're Abraham's seed right not only we Abraham's seed but says that we we we are Hees to the promise right am Hees to the promise come on the the we we we've been blessed abundantly right God and it wasn't through of none of nothing that what we've done to obtain that but it was God through his election right before the foundation of the world he decided to pick you right he already knew what decision youd make what choices you make so from the foundation of Of The World God had you in his mind right and he calls you his elect because he knew that one day you'd hear the call and The Voice come on you hear that voice and it's something would Quicken you and I think about that sometimes come on no matter the mess that you were in come on Amen no matter the rotness the filth the darkness that you were in you were you were a part of God from the beginning amen you belong to God and you going back to him amen come on Hallelujah no matter the darkness am come on no matter the place that you were in it's by election ain't it you know we sang that song I don't know why Jesus loved me and I don't know why he cares I don't know why he came and sacrific his life oh but I'm glad I'm so glad he did come on Hallelujah but you know we belong to Christ right so we're heirs to the promise come on he said in blessing I bless you we heirs to the promise right come on join HS with Christ I believe that with all of my heart so we look at you know what what are the promises come on Hallelujah we look at those promises and I says that God he swore by himself come on it was no greater that he could swear by he swore by himself come on and that still hold true right the power of the word still holds true to the day in the face I look at that in the face of sickness the power of the word still holds true don't it come on he said with the stripes you were heal the word left his mouth and it won't return to him void will it but it'll accomplish healing in somebody I believe it come on Hallelujah God is something something's got to happen you know I said the power of the word you know that we know the spoken word is the Original Seed come on we always talk about how we were in the Bible study with the children and sharing with them you know uh the birds fly blind all those things and all that says everything you see is a product of the spoken word everything you see come on is a product of what God spoke one day and it came about come on the power of the word God spoke it and it came about God created those trees and apples and all those things he said let them bring forth after their own kind right and from then hallelujah they still producing right and reproducing and bringing forth why the natural tree you might say have died but the life that was in the tree is still around come on because why that life came from God himself didn't it come on and you can't kill that life can you the life that life when God spoke it come on you talk about life it come from God himself you can't kill that life so when God comes into your heart saves you Hallelujah fills you with the Holy Ghost come on the Life of Christ not a jump a shout not a not a scream a hollow but the ve the literal Life of Christ comes inside of you can't kill that can it Hallelujah sickness attack your body death might come but oh death where is th sing Oh grave where is thy Victory because the light that's in you now didn't come from man did it came from God hallelujah oh that stirs your heart up Don't It come on that's the thing when when you know that you passed from Death to life then you are you Victorious nothing can't defeat you come come on oh we go through hardships trials mountains valleys but in all of that we are more than conquerors Hallelujah we passed from Death to life right you can kill this flesh but not the soul why because it's come from God and it's going back to him oh Jesus the life that God is giving us now oh the devil can't kill that life can he oh Jesus y'all believe that come on and that's what it is I says the the power of the word you imagine you you think about that sometimes come on that that we're not dealing with something that ain't been battle tested right we're not dealing with something that ain't that a ain't and doesn't have a firm foundation come on the promises that that we resting on it's got It's it's firm got firm foundation on it don't it come on this ain't just something that we just all excited about running around the church no but we know that what we've got been battle tested if I can say it like that come on it's been tested time tested come on from the beginning like I said he spoken and it's still the same way why Hallelujah cuz it's Eternal it's life come on it's God it's God did that did it it's God that spoken it it don't have to do it right can't nothing alter it oh Jesus ah Hallelujah when God speaks can't nothing alter it can it you know you down on your knees sometime praying saying Lord this is what you said Hallelujah this is your promise unto the children Hallelujah God I I like uh the Bible says after he patiently endured right come on he didn't get it sometimes overnight but Abraham patiently endured didn't he he was willing to wait on God come on in the wilderness he waited on God didn't he in the dry places he waited on God he patiently endured come on through the battles he had to go through he patiently endured come on enemies and things all around him but he patiently endured and waited on it didn't he because I believe that he knew that God couldn't lie Hallelujah right I said this morning are you willing to patiently wait on it come on without freten as they say come on wavering no God I'm willing to patiently wait on it amen I believe those Hebrew boys said our God is able right amen said even if he don't I know he's able and we still ain't going to bow down come on we've been given a char charge yes amen come on now hold up and we know what God promised our forefathers we don't have to defile ourself with the king's meat hallelujah oh Jesus Daniel knows but what it is because God's word hold true even in Babylon in held true didn't it come on his word it can't fall to the ground it can't fail it's the power in it come on but what it is God is is getting us what are all these trials what are all these things about God is getting us to that place right to way where you you got to you know I believe uh sister keish was saying the other night that nothing surprises her anymore you know and it's the truth nothing don't surprise you right but no matter what comes no matter what goes we're not surprised by it but I said the thing is I'm just going to trust God God in the situation because it didn't catch God underwear right God knew it would come before it happened he sent it your way but he also made a way of Escape come on I said Lord give us a testimony Hallelujah let the glory of the Lord come out this situation Hallelujah you know I said let the glory of the Lord is taking about situation let the glory of the Lord come out this situation God God you get the glory out of this situation let me testify of your goodness Lord let me tell somebody Hallelujah that God is still real that he's the same yesterday today and forever that the power is still in the word it's still holding true y'all believe it this morning somebody get God praise this morning come on it's still holding true you know he said the Heaven and Earth are pass away but my word it ain't going to pass right come on why it's a firm foundation you know we was looking at a house the other day in uh in the neighborhood the house burned down but they was building another house and they had that house up in no time they dug all the way in the ground and had that house up less than a month ain't it less than a month and we was like Lord they threw that house together didn't they but now you see they got these big old uh IE beams and stuff wased out there and got the whole house jacked up off the ground sitting on ey beams and they had to go and you can see what they're doing they're tearing the whole Foundation apart come on whole house was built in no time looking like it's going to be a pretty nice house they had to Jack the whole house up and now you see them tearing up up the foundation you see rubbles and rocks pil all on the side of the road right cuz no matter how beautiful the house looked it or was appearing to look right the inspector must have
