[29:57] we thank the lord for all of
[30:00] you that are here and those that are
[30:03] listening appreciate the lord
[30:10] hallelujah i feel like
[30:15] i don't know
[30:20] praise god i can't feel at home in this
[30:22] world anymore
[30:26] the book of hebrews 11th chapter the
[30:30] eighth verse
[30:38] life here is fleeing
[30:41] it's very short
[30:44] the bible says the days of a man life is
[30:49] three school years and ten and by reason
[30:51] the strength to be four school years
[30:56] somebody talks about and then when this
[30:59] life is over we'll fly away
[31:04] here in hebrews
[31:07] 11 8 said by faith
[31:11] abraham when he was called to go out
[31:15] until a place
[31:18] which he should have to receive an
[31:21] inheritance
[31:22] obeyed and he went out
[31:27] not knowing whether he went
[31:30] by faith he's adjourned in the land of
[31:33] promise
[31:35] as in a strange country
[31:38] dwelling in tabernacles with eyes and
[31:40] jacob
[31:42] the heirs with him of the same
[31:46] promise for
[31:49] he looked for a city
[31:53] which builds those which had foundation
[31:57] whose builder and maker is god
[32:01] looking for a city you may be seated
[32:05] looking for a city
[32:12] we heard god's servant talked about the
[32:14] future home
[32:17] and by the grace of god there is a
[32:20] future home for you and i
[32:24] for all those that love his appearance
[32:27] god has a place
[32:30] prepared for you and i
[32:31] [Music]
[32:34] there is a future home
[32:38] and as we think about that future home
[32:41] that god
[32:42] has gone away to prepare a place for you
[32:45] and i
[32:47] abraham looked for a city
[32:53] and i was looking and our anticipation
[32:59] we're looking for a city
[33:06] see in looking for the city we must
[33:09] recognize
[33:11] not what's going to be things that ought
[33:14] to be
[33:16] but we want not only to look at things
[33:18] that ought to be but the things that are
[33:24] for solomon altman said that which has
[33:28] been is now and he said
[33:32] that which is the bee has already been
[33:36] and he said there is nothing new under
[33:39] the sun
[33:43] so as we look at the old testament it
[33:45] was a
[33:46] type and shadow of things to come
[33:51] and i believe that god
[33:56] never left himself without witness
[34:01] so here in looking for the city
[34:06] in the same 11 i mean in the 12th
[34:10] chapter maybe i'll just read
[34:14] revelation excuse me revelation 21
[34:17] revelation 21 and 1
[34:19] looking for a city hopefully we can just
[34:23] lay a foundation here
[34:26] if i don't get too excited
[34:30] what i was getting excited about in
[34:32] prior
[34:36] yesterday it was
[34:39] i was thinking about our lord
[34:42] and i was thinking about and that song
[34:46] came into my heart he's a waymaker
[34:50] one day he made it away from me
[34:54] i believe he made the bible say the
[34:58] builder and maker
[34:59] is gone
[35:02] he's a way maker
[35:06] i thought about when they sing the song
[35:10] and when they oftentimes we hear him say
[35:13] that he'll make a way out of nowhere
[35:17] [Music]
[35:19] when there's no way he'll make a way
[35:24] my mind went back and looked at the
[35:27] children of
[35:28] israel as there was no waste
[35:30] [Music]
[35:32] when the mountains in the army was
[35:35] behind them in the sea was in front of
[35:37] them
[35:38] amen he will make a way
[35:42] god amen made a way
[35:47] said stand still
[35:51] oh yes brother and sister i don't know
[35:54] what you're going through today
[35:57] ah but god is away makeup
[36:01] yes he will he'll make a way for you
[36:08] we got a god that can make a way
[36:12] you know sometimes the light journey
[36:14] seems to be very
[36:16] amen close in on you sometimes
[36:20] amen and things amen began to be
[36:23] amen somewhat pressurized
[36:27] and we don't know what to do with our
[36:29] circumstances
[36:30] and our situation sometimes
[36:33] amen and sometimes we can't see how
[36:37] things are going to get better i thought
[36:41] about
[36:41] uh uh what we're going through now
[36:47] and i said lord amen
[36:50] in the midst of the crisis that we face
[36:54] the economical crisis uh uh
[36:57] the sickness in the uh this uh
[37:00] corona virus amen in the midst of
[37:04] all that we're going through how can
[37:08] things get better i like to encourage
[37:11] you this morning
[37:13] but he will make a way
[37:17] somehow amen
[37:20] he'll make a way for you
[37:23] well that seemed no way hallelujah
[37:27] he will make a way
[37:30] the bible says that there's no
[37:32] temptation taking us
[37:34] with such as common demand but god with
[37:37] the temptation
[37:40] make a way for us to escape
[37:44] yes he'll make a way
[37:46] [Music]
[37:47] amen of escape praise god i'll tell you
[37:52] it might seem like amen amen the world
[37:55] is closely
[37:57] closing in around you but god will make
[38:01] a way
[38:03] somebody need to see that amen
[38:06] through your darkest hours amen the sun
[38:10] is shining
[38:11] on the other side of the clouds
[38:14] amen and i want you to know the sun is
[38:16] still down
[38:18] and i want you to know not to ask you in
[38:21] son but they are so in son
[38:24] jesus is still there
[38:27] [Music]
[38:29] and he'll make a way for you
[38:34] praise god he'll make a way
[38:38] amen i was so stirred up and
[38:42] amen i realized the largest servant
[38:46] when the syrian army was all around the
[38:48] bottom
[38:50] and uh amen and the servant
[38:53] says amen he thought that
[38:57] it was all over and the enemy was
[38:59] closing in on them
[39:02] and um he elijah said
