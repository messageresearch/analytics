[43:08] not and when thou art
[43:12] converted strengthen thy Brethren amen
[43:17] amen the book of
[43:19] Jude just before Revelation the book of
[43:24] jeude I want to talk about save
[43:28] but not
[43:30] converted thank
[43:32] youus save but not converted
[43:37] am sometimes folks try to take folks
[43:42] salvation away from
[43:45] them and tell folks they're not saved
[43:48] because they're not with
[43:51] us folks uh Salvation is of the Lord
[43:57] and he saves whomsoever he
[44:02] will but save and not
[44:08] converted what a condition what a
[44:12] situation we
[44:14] have today as it
[44:18] was back
[44:20] then as we read juw here the fifth verse
[44:24] of Jew
[44:28] it says I will therefore put you in
[44:32] remembrance though ye once knew this how
[44:37] that the Lord having what save the
[44:40] people now some folks said God did not
[44:44] save
[44:48] them I'm using the word save amen
[44:53] because the Bible say after he saved
[44:56] them
[44:59] isn't that
[45:00] right people say
[45:04] well this person is not saved
[45:09] because saved but not
[45:19] converted said after saving to save the
[45:22] people out of the land of Egypt he after
[45:26] dest destroy them that what believe not
[45:30] that believe
[45:34] not sometimes we talked on it many times
[45:37] you hear it all the time that we said
[45:40] that God lifts a cup up out of the mud a
[45:45] glass out of the mud
[45:47] right now he lifts it up out of the mud
[45:51] but the it's still muddy and dirty amen
[45:55] amen
[45:57] okay God Lift us up out of our sins and
[46:01] picked us
[46:06] up but you after picking the c glass up
[46:10] he washes it
[46:14] amen so once we're Justified then God
[46:18] comes and he sanctifies
[46:21] us cleans us
[46:25] up some folks have gone through the
[46:28] motion
[46:30] but it's only gone through the
[46:34] motion God Amen done a work for them
[46:38] yes I think they shouted they dance when
[46:41] they got cross the Red Sea and they saw
[46:45] the enemy destroyed amen amen were they
[46:52] saved egyp is a type of sin
[46:59] and God delivered them from their
[47:02] sin are you with me amen God brought
[47:06] them out amen from the Egyptian bondage
[47:13] amen some folks were delivered from all
[47:17] types of drugs and all types of habits
[47:20] and they were delivered
[47:24] amen there was no doubt in there mind
[47:27] these children they danced they shout
[47:32] it they praise the Lord amen cuz God had
[47:37] worked miracles for him amen amen are
[47:40] you with me amen when God save you you
[47:44] got something to shout
[47:46] about amen when you know that you're
[47:48] saved you got something to shout
[47:51] about they were
[47:54] save it was something about
[48:00] it was
[48:01] farther they had more distance to go
[48:04] before they got what God had in store
[48:08] for them for God made promises to you
[48:11] yes amen see after you repent and be
[48:15] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[48:18] the remission of your sin then God
[48:22] says amen
[48:27] he makes promises amen he said this
[48:30] promis to
[48:31] you and to your children and to them
[48:35] that have fall off amen the promise of
[48:38] what the promise that if you repent and
[48:41] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[48:43] you shall that's right amen
[48:46] amen receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[48:49] amen sometimes it doesn't mean that you
[48:52] got it he said You shall amen receive it
[48:56] amen
[48:57] but you amen after repenting and being
[49:00] baptized and you don't get it you got to
[49:04] say God you
[49:06] said you
[49:08] share you made a promise to me Lord amen
[49:13] and you keep your
[49:14] promises if you say me then I know you
[49:18] can feel
[49:19] me are you with me I know you can God
[49:25] you can feel me amen amen but sometime
[49:28] folks stop just with being
[49:33] saved and we've been
[49:35] taught sometimes the wrong
[49:38] way because instead of folks uh
[49:41] receiving the uh Holy Ghost they
[49:46] shout because they
[49:48] happy they've been delivered amen amen
[49:52] oh they feel that Joy amen amen they

[50:16] many people in church
[50:18] today need to be converted amen let's go
[50:22] back to um Luke here uh and and 22

[50:32] response to those that Jesus had uh told
[50:36] them what would happen to them in the
[50:38] future in the Kingdom that they would
[50:41] judg they would be on the set on Thrones
[50:44] and judge the 12 tribes of
[50:47] Israel their position amen and God had
[50:51] identified but he said uh Simon Peter I
