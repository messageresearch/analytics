[52:59] brother Nicholas shanet from South
[53:02] Africa will be sharing with us tonight
[53:05] but before he comes forth we're going to
[53:08] ask it's it's a Revival taking place
[53:10] over in yuganda you hear about two 300
[53:14] getting baptized at one time in the name
[53:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ and I told him
[53:19] just to give us a brief testimony so
[53:21] Brother Sam going to come and give us a
[53:24] brief testimony of what God is doing in
[53:27] Uganda let's receive brother Samuel from
[53:32] [Applause]
[53:46] Uganda God bless you all bless I want to
[53:50] see Hands
[53:51] Up amen
[53:57] uh I just want to take this privilege to
[53:59] greet all of you again in that mighty
[54:02] name of our Lord Jesus
[54:05] Christ a name that's above every
[54:08] name the
[54:10] name of the Lord Jesus
[54:14] Christ uh I thank God for the grace that
[54:17] he has given us and
[54:21] especially
[54:23] uh to shine upon us
[54:27] am that we come to
[54:29] know the message of the
[54:32] hour I believe that's the greatest thing
[54:35] because the Bible
[54:36] says God wants all
[54:39] people to get saved and to come to the
[54:42] knowledge of the truth
[54:44] amen because there are many who are
[54:47] saved but they don't have not come the
[54:50] knowledge of the truth and we know Jesus
[54:55] said is the way
[54:56] the truth and the
[54:59] life
[55:00] amen and
[55:03] uh just before I just give a
[55:07] testimony I feel that I should just give
[55:11] a
[55:13] greeting and
[55:16] uh maybe you shall just read one
[55:18] scripture as I greet
[55:21] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:24] that is uh
[55:27] John chapter
[55:43] 15 ah the Bible
[55:48] says I am the
[55:51] vine I'm the True Vine and my father is
[55:56] the the husband
[55:58] man every branch in me that beareth not
[56:03] fruit he taketh
[56:06] away and every branch that beareth fruit
[56:11] he PES it that it
[56:14] may bring forth more
[56:19] fruit now ye are clean through the word
[56:23] which I have spoken unto you
[56:27] abide in me and I in you as the branch
[56:33] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[56:37] abide in the vine nor more can ye except
[56:42] you abide in
[56:44] me I am the vine ye are the
[56:48] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[56:53] him the same bringeth
[56:56] forth much fruit for without me he can
[57:02] do
[57:04] nothing if a man abide in
[57:08] me he is if a man abide not in me he is
[57:14] cast forth as a
[57:16] branch and is withered and Men gather
[57:21] them and cast them into the fire and
[57:25] they are burned
[57:27] if he abide in me and my words abide in
[57:30] you he shall ask whatsoever you will and
[57:35] it shall be done unto you here in is my
[57:39] father uh glorified that ye bear much
[57:44] fruit so shall ye be my
[57:49] disciples
[57:51] amen I believe that's the purpose of
[57:56] these tent
[57:58] meetings is for us to bear
[58:02] fruit and the fruits that the Bible is
[58:05] talking about here I believe not the
[58:08] fruits of First
[58:11] Corinthians but this is bringing more
[58:16] Christians to the Lord yes
[58:18] sir because if the life of the Lord
[58:21] Jesus Christ is in you according to the
[58:24] Bible then you will bear much
[58:28] fruit it does not mean only that by
[58:32] preaching but the life when the life of
[58:35] Jesus is in you whether you are not
[58:38] preaching yeah but your life will be
[58:42] able to Bear
[58:44] fruits that is to see that it will bring
[58:47] more people to
[58:48] Christ and any branch according to
[58:52] scripture that does not bear any fruit
[58:55] it that the Life of Christ is not in
[58:59] that
[59:01] person because if the Life of Christ is
[59:04] in you he is abiding in you then the
[59:08] Life of Christ will bear fruits because
[59:12] you are the branch I am the
[59:16] branch amen so the purpose of Christ
[59:20] being in US is to bring forth much
[59:25] fruit and the Bible says that's when the
[59:28] father is
[59:29] glorified when you bring forth much
[59:33] fruit
[59:35] amen so my brother my
[59:38] sister God wants you to bring forth much
[59:43] fruit otherwise you'll be
[59:47] Barren and if you are Barren the Bible
[59:50] says you should be cut
[59:52] off and cast in the fire so many any
[59:57] Christians claim to be
[1:00:00] Christians Hallelujah claim to be
[1:00:04] Believers but they are not abiding in
[1:00:07] the branch meaning that they are not
[1:00:10] bringing forth any
[1:00:11] fruit and if you are Barren then you
[1:00:14] should be Cast Away oh
[1:00:18] my I just want to say something small
[1:00:21] here before I give my testimony
[1:00:26] says here in the message a blessing
[1:00:31] Prophet I know God's
[1:00:34] program is written out here in the
[1:00:37] Bible and I'm ashamed of myself as a
[1:00:41] minister of the Gospel 1 million Souls
[1:00:45] won I ought to have 10 million Souls
[1:00:50] won I am a way behind
[1:00:56] what about
[1:00:59] you how many Souls you want since you've
[1:01:03] been in
[1:01:06] Christ Christianity is just goes from
[1:01:09] one to
[1:01:11] another bearing fruit no
[1:01:14] so how many Souls you want since you've
[1:01:17] been a
[1:01:19] Christian if you are not winning Souls
[1:01:21] you are
[1:01:23] guilty you are barren
[1:01:26] you have brought shame on the church and
[1:01:29] the
[1:01:30] gospel how many people you get out for
[1:01:33] Wednesday night prayer meetings if you
[1:01:37] are not doing it you are you ought to be
[1:01:39] ashamed of yourself before
[1:01:42] Christ you are guilty and your place is
[1:01:45] at the
[1:01:46] altar I I invite you to come with me for
[1:01:51] repentance amen amen so ask yourself my
[1:01:56] Brother since you became a
[1:02:00] Christian how many Souls have you WN to
[1:02:04] Christ if not then you are
[1:02:07] baren you should be a branch to be cut
[1:02:11] off amen oh God may God help us and the
[1:02:16] purpose of these meetings is for us to
[1:02:18] bring souls to
[1:02:20] Christ and wherever you are as a
[1:02:23] Christian whether you are working
[1:02:25] whether you are a woman whatever you are
[1:02:28] your purpose is to bring somebody to
[1:02:35] Christ is that right God bless
[1:02:39] you I just give my small
[1:02:43] testimony I believe it was in
[1:02:48] 2016 um i' had gone to
[1:02:52] Zimbabwe for a missionary work
[1:02:57] and had traveled for about 4 days from
[1:03:01] Uganda in a
[1:03:04] bus and took about 4 days because cross
[1:03:08] from Uganda to Kenya from Kenya to
[1:03:11] Zambia from
[1:03:13] Zambia then you go to
[1:03:17] Zimbabwe so I took about 4
[1:03:20] days and around 10: in the evening I was
[1:03:25] resting
[1:03:27] tired is when I heard a voice calling me
[1:03:30] Samuel
[1:03:32] Samuel you have gone to many countries
[1:03:36] preaching this
[1:03:38] gospel what about your
[1:03:41] people go back to your people and preach
[1:03:44] to them this
[1:03:46] gospel
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:51] and when I went back home because the
[1:03:55] place where I am
[1:03:56] pastoring is not my
[1:04:00] birthplace I think brother
[1:04:03] kith is knows about because he has been
[1:04:06] visiting
[1:04:07] us so when I went back home then I felt
[1:04:12] a burden of going back home to my people
[1:04:15] my
[1:04:17] birthplace
[1:04:19] amen and when I
[1:04:22] went I was invited to preach
[1:04:27] in one of the Anglican
[1:04:31] churches which to them they said it is
[1:04:34] me who started at
[1:04:36] church before I came to the place where
[1:04:38] I am right now when I was still in
[1:04:42] Pentecost so it's just a young boy of
[1:04:46] about 15 years who told me Pastor you go
[1:04:50] back to Busia that's the place I Stay
[1:04:53] come back next week you'll be the one to
[1:04:55] preach
[1:04:56] in that church so when I
[1:05:00] went I came back to Bia and I went back
[1:05:03] I think after one or two
[1:05:06] weeks and I was given the chance to
[1:05:10] preach there was a reverend with a
[1:05:12] caller and other ministers but they told
[1:05:16] them today there is a vistor is going to
[1:05:19] preach
[1:05:21] amen and I just took one scripture from
[1:05:24] chapter 1 Timothy
[1:05:28] 2:3 this is good and acceptable in the
[1:05:31] sight of God who wants all men to get
[1:05:34] saved and to come the know of the truth
[1:05:37] and from that scripture I continue all
[1:05:40] up to
[1:05:41] baptism and one brother said pastor you
[1:05:45] go back to theia when you come back
[1:05:47] you'll baptize
[1:05:49] me and after I went back I baptized four
[1:05:53] people and the church started from there
[1:05:56] Lord
[1:05:58] amen and God gave us
[1:06:01] Grace we bought land and we also build a
[1:06:05] church brother kith has been there I
[1:06:07] think twice now and from that church we
[1:06:11] have already started other three more
[1:06:14] churches in that
[1:06:16] [Applause]
[1:06:19] place
[1:06:20] amen and know people are being baptized
[1:06:24] every week
[1:06:27] every month even when I was here they
[1:06:30] baptized some people last
[1:06:33] Sunday amen so people are coming to the
[1:06:38] Lord amen the Revival is going on on and
[1:06:43] on many people are coming to the
[1:06:47] Lord amen and I believe when brother Cas
[1:06:51] was there amen many people he ministered
[1:06:56] to amen now it is my
[1:07:01] prayer
[1:07:03] amen that you continue praying for the
[1:07:06] work in
[1:07:08] Uganda I'm speaking mostly about my area
[1:07:12] that is Eastern
[1:07:13] Uganda
[1:07:15] amen and uh I would say
[1:07:20] this that God really needs to help us
[1:07:26] because many many
[1:07:30] ministers
[1:07:31] amen they are struggling to preach the
[1:07:35] gospel but they don't even have
[1:07:40] support amen sir most of them even don't
[1:07:44] have bicycles I think brother kith is a
[1:07:48] witness not even a bicycle in our
[1:07:52] meetings we have very many meetings like
[1:07:54] this but may not even have one m one
[1:07:58] vehicle but here you have vehicles
[1:08:02] everywhere amen amen but we are
[1:08:06] struggling to bring in souls to the
[1:08:09] kingdom in any way possible yes sir so
[1:08:13] we are asking for your prayers amen that
[1:08:16] God May touch
[1:08:19] you in any way I believe prayers is more
[1:08:23] important
[1:08:25] if God would touch some of these
[1:08:29] ministers
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:32] amen instead of them paying tithe to one
[1:08:35] another they should pay tithe to some of
[1:08:38] those poor
[1:08:39] ministers so that the work of God may
[1:08:42] continue God bless
[1:08:44] [Applause]
[1:08:51] you appreciate it

[2:00:33] shout that the enemy is too
[2:00:39] late I'm standing as a living
[2:00:42] testimony that God is the same
[2:00:45] yesterday today and
[2:00:49] forever the plan of the enemy is
[2:00:57] defeated I'm grateful this evening to be
[2:01:01] here I'm here I'm a t 10 preacher I love
[2:01:05] the work of the Lord I've seen many
[2:01:07] souls coming in in 10 meetings lives
[2:01:10] been changed we had one
[2:01:13] campaign 10 meetings me and my dead and
[2:01:16] the Holy Ghost was present there was a
[2:01:18] man in a wheelchair coming in and he
[2:01:21] comes in here all swollen up his
[2:01:22] wheelchair was in a very bad condition
[2:01:25] there was no tires it was been put
[2:01:27] together by wires and it was you could
[2:01:29] see the condition of the man and the
[2:01:31] condition of the wheelchair they have
[2:01:32] been so close netted together probably
[2:01:34] for the last 10 to 20 years 20 years he
[2:01:37] came into the prayer line and the Holy
[2:01:40] Ghost moves such a mighty way he stood
[2:01:42] in the prayer line and look at his
[2:01:44] condition you don't have even to ask him
[2:01:45] what is wrong take the oil anoint him we
[2:01:49] prayed and asked the Lord to heal him is
[2:01:51] legs was like this
[2:01:53] swollen and the next moment these legs
[2:01:56] started to
[2:02:00] shrink when God is on the scene you
[2:02:02] don't have to do much
[2:02:04] amen you can just speak the word and
[2:02:06] everything is
[2:02:08] well you don't have to scream and shout
[2:02:11] L when the presence of God is there you
[2:02:14] just do the
[2:02:15] thing and I said to him sir you can
[2:02:18] stand up and go God has made you well
[2:02:23] he looked at me like this he pulled me
[2:02:25] in the caller here he pulled me back he
[2:02:28] said to me
[2:02:29] sir if I stand up here
[2:02:33] today there might
[2:02:35] be government people in this
[2:02:38] tent social
[2:02:40] workers if they see me standing up
[2:02:44] today they will take away my
[2:02:50] grant when we have realized in 10
[2:02:53] meetings it's no more so effective than
[2:02:56] it was in the
[2:02:57] past because people have become
[2:03:01] slaves of government
[2:03:04] support they rather remain sick they
[2:03:08] rather remain in that condition than to
[2:03:11] stand up and walk out and be a living
[2:03:15] testimony he said I cannot stand up
[2:03:19] here I might lose my money
[2:03:22] if I stand up here a few days later his
[2:03:27] coffin pass the tent on the way to the
[2:03:32] burial
[2:03:34] site he

[2:03:39] accept the portion that God had for you

[3:17:03] something too many preachers in this
[3:17:05] message are looking for William Brenham
[3:17:07] in every verse of scripture that's not
[3:17:10] what the message taught us the message
[3:17:12] taught us to look to
[3:17:14] Christ look for Christ and ver of
[3:17:18] scripture you know what that's caus it's
[3:17:21] caus two
[3:17:23] absolutes ain't no such thing is two
[3:17:25] absolutes brother Henry there's only one
[3:17:28] absolute and that's Jesus Christ
[3:17:31] himself
[3:17:33] Hallelujah you know brother bam when he
[3:17:35] preached the absolutes he actually said
[3:17:37] there was about five or six different
[3:17:39] absolutes Hall he said a vision from God
[3:17:42] is an absolute he said the written word
[3:17:45] of God is an absolute the Holy Ghost
[3:17:46] both is an absolute but when I study it
[3:17:49] all you know what I found out it all it
[3:17:51] all ties into the Holy Spirit see if it
[3:17:55] comes from the holy spirit it's the
[3:17:58] absolute and I believe my salvation came
[3:18:01] from the Holy Spirit I've got an
[3:18:03] absolute in my soul I believe God hears
