[29:53] book of Songs of Solomon
[29:56] the songs of Solomon 6.
[29:59] I mean eight and six
[30:03] eight and six
[30:06] the songs of Solomon eight
[30:10] and six
[30:12] set me as a seal upon thine heart
[30:17] and as a seal upon that arm
[30:20] for love is strong as death
[30:24] jealousy is cruel as the greed
[30:29] the coals there are coals of Fire
[30:34] which has
[30:36] a most vehicle Flame
[30:40] God bless the reasons words you may be
[30:42] seated
[30:49] Genesis 20 I mean 37
[30:53] Genesis 37 and 4.
[30:57] Genesis 37
[31:00] and four
[31:05] I says jealousy is cruel as a grave
[31:13] we have seen
[31:16] jealousy and jealousy it's a great
[31:18] hindrance of the body of Jesus Christ
[31:24] the prophet of God preached a message
[31:26] from that time
[31:28] from that time
[31:32] from that time when jealousy comes in
[31:37] from that time
[31:39] it changes the complex of one's life
[31:43] that persons can never be the same
[31:46] as long as that Spirit exists
[31:52] but sometimes the spirit Creeps in
[31:54] unaware
[31:56] but no doubt the attributes of it
[32:01] the tree is known by its fruit
[32:04] the manifestation of it
[32:08] I've seen ministers jealous of ministers
[32:12] I've seen church members jealous of
[32:14] church members I've seen employees
[32:17] jealous of other the employees I've seen
[32:19] the spirit of jealousy
[32:22] being around for a little while
[32:24] and I've seen the damaging effects of
[32:27] jealousy
[32:30] I've seen the crippling effects of
[32:33] jealousy
[32:35] and I'm telling you jealousy
[32:38] runs rampant
[32:41] in all forms of society
[32:44] in all walks of life
[32:47] jealousy
[32:49] affects one's
[32:51] life in a major way
[32:55] and when that spirit of jealousy gets
[32:57] upon a person
[33:00] you know sometimes
[33:03] it comes because God has rejected the
[33:05] person
[33:09] when God rejects rejected Saul
[33:15] it didn't immediately happen
[33:18] because
[33:20] Saul disobedience
[33:24] we'll get there after a while
[33:27] because it's all Saul disobed God
[33:29] disobeyed God
[33:31] yet he had a lot of sacrifices that he
[33:33] made
[33:35] yet he bought back what he thought God
[33:37] would please God when God told him
[33:40] what to do he said kill everything
[33:43] but he thought it was you know he said I
[33:47] listened to the people
[33:49] you know
[33:50] sometimes we give excuses
[33:54] for what we have done under Disobedience
[33:56] to God's word
[33:58] when God gives you the word
[34:02] it's no excuse
[34:04] for not obeying what God Said
[34:07] and God speaks to us
[34:10] speaks our heart by the holy spirit is
[34:13] no excuse
[34:15] would not obeying what God said to us
[34:18] the Holy Spirit would never leave you
[34:20] wrong
[34:22] the holy spirit always leads you how you
[34:24] know when the Holy Spirit is leading you
[34:26] right
[34:27] you can search it out by the word
[34:30] holy spirit always leads you to obey the
[34:33] word it doesn't matter or your
[34:35] compromise and your feeling how you
[34:37] think about it it doesn't have anything
[34:39] it's what the word say
[34:43] when we're outside of the word we're
[34:45] outside of God's Divine protection
[34:49] we're outside of the word we're outside
[34:51] of the will of God
[34:56] that means the blessing that God would
[34:59] have blessed us with he cannot bless us
[35:02] until we're back into the promised land
[35:04] are you with me
[35:06] we got to come back into the promised
[35:08] land and God's promised land for us is
[35:11] his word
[35:12] and his word said if you abide in me and
[35:16] my word abide in you then you can ask
[35:18] what you will and I will do it
[35:21] but outside of the promised land outside
[35:23] of oh God your Homeland
[35:27] what God has given you he given you his
[35:29] word
[35:30] are you with me and you get out of the
[35:33] Homeland then you curse yourself
[35:36] you cannot look for the blessings of God
[35:38] to be upon you out of your Homeland
[35:41] that's why when you get back in your
[35:43] Homeland then you're ready to receive
[35:45] the blessings that come from God
[35:51] here we are
[35:53] um 37 and four it says oh I got me some
[35:57] readers in here come on brother Ernest
[36:01] God bless you
[36:03] you said and when his Brethren saw that
[36:08] their father loved him more than all the
[36:11] brethren
[36:13] they what hated him did what hated him
[36:18] oh Lord
[36:20] not me
[36:23] let me see what jealousy is all about as
[36:26] the dictionary says
[36:30] jealousy work work
[36:33] are afraid
[36:35] that some
[36:38] one
[36:40] is taking the love
[36:42] of the attention
[36:44] one has a warrant
[36:48] does that sound familiar
[36:51] jealousy
[36:53] worried or afraid that someone is taking
[36:58] the love
[37:00] all the attention
[37:02] one has or wants
[37:05] unhappy
[37:08] in the Years
[37:10] and he talks about the images means
[37:12] jealousy or dislike felt
[37:18] because of different things I'll get to
[37:21] that later hopefully but jealousy
[37:26] examine yourselves and see whether you
[37:28] be into Faith see whether that Spirit
[37:31] ever comes up to try to latch on to you
[37:34] as individuals
[37:36] see whether that Spirit ever enter into
[37:38] you and begin to tempt you will begin to
[37:41] wow you
[37:44] when jealousy takes hold of you
[37:46] sometimes you
[37:48] folks have said I don't like her
[37:52] I don't care for her nine out of ten
[37:56] you say well that ain't what I mean that
[37:59] ain't what you mean but many times
[38:01] that's what you're saying when you say I
[38:04] dislike her I don't care for her that
[38:06] many times that's a jealous spirit
[38:10] are you with me
[38:12] now if you're just a plain devil you
[38:14] just don't like that devil that got a
[38:17] hold of that person
[38:18] so you've got to distinguish the the
[38:21] spirit
[38:23] then
[38:25] the uh the person
[38:27] because sometimes it's a spirit on a
[38:30] person that you dislike it's not the
[38:32] person that you dislike it's a spirit
[38:34] that's on that person that you dislike
[38:37] are you with me man so when you say I
[38:40] don't like that person you got to talk
[38:42] right because a Christian don't talk
[38:45] like that
[38:46] you know uh but a baby does a baby talk
[38:50] like you know any kind of talk come out
[38:52] of their mouth when they babes they can
[38:54] talk like that you know because they
[38:56] know
[38:58] you know baby
[38:59] Christians that hadn't come to maturity
[39:02] they said certain things
[39:05] out of their mouth because they are
[39:08] babes but when we become matured
[39:10] Christians we try to watch what we say
[39:14] and be careful what we speak and how we
[39:18] say and how we conduct ourselves as
[39:21] matured Christians
[39:23] are you with me and I don't believe God
[39:26] coming back for a baby church but he's
[39:29] coming back for a church that's mature
[39:33] with that spot we wrinkle blemish any
[39:35] such thing so this church in this last
[39:38] age must be come to Perfection come to
[39:41] maturity are you with me
[39:45] so if you're gonna be a part of the
[39:47] Bride word amen church then you're gonna
[39:51] have to come to maturity
[39:54] and now it's the responsibility that God
[39:57] has put in the hand of the five-fold
[40:00] ministry to bring you to perfection
[40:04] are you with me
[40:05] so uh God sent his word and it healed it
[40:10] delivered them
[40:11] okay
[40:12] so um he's saying
[40:17] you know Joseph and his brother his
[40:19] brother had a problem with him
[40:22] and one of the problems is because
[40:25] the father what
[40:27] loved him
[40:29] it's not that the father didn't love
[40:31] them his father loved them too
[40:34] but it just seeming like that was a
[40:38] little extra
[40:40] love
[40:42] to Joseph
[40:45] and because of that a little extra put
[40:47] over there his brother's what
[40:51] he hated him
[40:53] did Joseph have anything to do with that
[40:55] his father loving him like that what did
[40:58] Joseph do
[40:59] to deserve for his father to love him
[41:03] he just was a Joseph
[41:06] and I'm saying when you're a Christian
[41:08] amen and you got God in the inside all
[41:12] you got to do is be a Christian for
[41:14] folks that hate you
[41:16] for the world
[41:17] love there what
[41:20] oh all you got to do is be saved
[41:23] all you got to do just uh live a holy
[41:26] and Sanctified life and just be saved
[41:28] folks just gonna hate you
[41:31] they hated Jesus we died of what without
[41:34] a cause they gonna hate you without a
[41:36] call they just you know hate you and I'm
[41:38] gonna tell you some folk in the church I
[41:40] hate you worse than the folks in the
[41:42] world
[41:42] because a religious spirit is ten times
[41:45] worse
[41:46] than the people in the world
[41:48] are you with me
[41:55] okay let's the fifth verse brothers and
[42:00] Joseph dreamed a dream and he told his
[42:02] brother and they hated him yet the more
[42:04] oh goodness
[42:07] when God is getting a hold of somebody
[42:09] and they you know a little spiritual and
[42:12] you know trying to be nice to tell him
[42:15] about it
[42:17] huh
[42:19] you can see him who
[42:21] he think he is
[42:24] telling us this dream
[42:27] they probably didn't even want to hear
[42:30] it
[42:31] because of who he was I don't even want
[42:33] to hate him you know how folks get the
[42:35] they got that little group and their
[42:36] little skills them and here's some I I
[42:39] don't want to have him I want to hear
[42:41] her she ain't got nothing to say to me
[42:43] and you can see the attitude on them
[42:46] they don't even know that they gotta let
[42:48] him know
[42:51] you know they go on and you can see that
[42:54] you know if it was the right spirit
[42:57] sometimes you know a person don't have
[42:59] the right spirit and you don't want to
[43:02] deal with that spirit
[43:03] are you with me
[43:05] so you're dealing with spiritual
[43:07] wickedness that got a hold of that
[43:10] person so you're praying God be merciful
[43:13] so you have to do everything to maintain
[43:16] and keep yourself in the love of God
[43:19] because the spirit amen is trying to
[43:23] conduct itself in a way it should not
[43:26] conduct itself with a so-called brother
[43:29] or sister
[43:31] and when that spirit is conducted in
[43:33] itself you know and not becoming
[43:36] godliness of Holiness then you got to be
[43:39] able to resist the devil
[43:42] because of that Spirit overtake you
[43:45] you become one like them
[43:50] you know I said if if there's a bad
[43:53] attitude
[43:55] it should not cause you to have a bad
[43:57] attitude
[43:59] but having a matured people Christian
[44:01] because people are babes in Christ if
[44:04] somebody come to them with a nasty and a
[44:06] bad attitude you know what
[44:10] you come here with that bad attitude you
[44:13] know what you're gonna get
[44:15] another bad attitude
[44:18] are you with me because you ain't coming
[44:20] here with that y'all hear me
[44:24] [Music]
[44:26] a lot of times folks
[44:28] they know they can take advantage of the
[44:29] preaching didn't come with a bad nasty
[44:32] attitude and the preacher guy
[44:34] just be quiet take it
[44:37] the preacher King said nothing
[44:39] foreign
[44:42] get behind me say
[44:46] the preacher had to take everything from
[44:49] everybody
[44:52] if he just raised his voice a little bit
[44:54] then his his attitude is bad
[44:58] but they can be just as nasty
[45:01] and some folks are ornery as can be
[45:04] and the preacher had to take it all
[45:06] right but that's the way God made the
[45:09] preacher
[45:10] he has to take you
[45:13] because why
[45:15] he is the one that has to give account
[45:19] for the people he can't allow their bad
[45:22] attitude to get on him
[45:24] and listen God give him permission to
[45:27] cast that devil out
[45:30] are you with him
[45:32] see it comes a time when God said okay
[45:36] that devil and linger too long
[45:39] devil get out of here
[45:41] are you with me Paul let that woman
[45:43] these men are the great man I thought 80
[45:46] minutes following them around they were
[45:48] telling the truth wasn't it
[45:49] but that was a lying spirit that was a
[45:52] witchcraft Spirit on that woman
[45:54] and Paul had to turn around after a
[45:56] period of time
[45:58] and he had to rebuke that devil
[46:00] are you with me
[46:03] so so no no no no don't think that
[46:06] because
[46:08] the preacher has to take certain things
[46:10] it come a time when the preacher got to
[46:14] God give him a mission to rebuke the
[46:17] devil
[46:20] I don't want to speak
[46:24] the preacher might have wasn't expecting
[46:26] to do it but it came a season and a time
[46:30] where God said call it the devil and let
[46:33] it not be known that that is the devil
[46:36] and that is the devil that's got to hold
[46:38] it Jesus said Peter get behind me who
[46:42] Satan
[46:44] you think Jesus apologized for saying
[46:46] that
[46:47] Peter I'm sorry I call you Satan
[46:49] no he didn't apologize because he wasn't
[46:51] talking he wasn't addressing Peter he
[46:54] was addressing Satan that had gotten a
[46:57] hold of Peter are you with me so we got
[46:59] to realize that we're not addressing a
[47:02] person we have to address the spirit
[47:06] and you better be sure you're addressing
[47:08] the spirit and not that person because
[47:10] God gets you from damaging one of his
[47:12] little children
[47:15] it doesn't matter if you to preach it
[47:17] doesn't matter you the Deacon doesn't
[47:19] matter who you are it's a touching out
[47:21] my anointing
[47:23] no matter how wrong they are don't touch
[47:25] them
[47:27] I I might get there
[47:30] hopefully but it's the time was gonna
[47:32] fail me
[47:34] y'all know about David and Saul no
[47:36] matter how he was
[47:39] God said don't touch him
[47:42] David said don't you touch God's
[47:43] anointed
[47:45] you had many times he had a time a
[47:47] chance to kill Saul but he didn't kill
[47:49] him did he
[47:50] because he knew what the word said touch
[47:52] not my anointing do my prophets know
[47:55] harm
[47:56] are you with me
[47:58] so God see sometimes we
[48:03] oh God I can't
[48:05] if I could sit at we ain't just dare to
[48:08] try sometimes folks you know they'll say
[48:11] things that Angels wouldn't even say
[48:14] you know
[48:15] and some preachers that say things and
[48:17] Angels wouldn't even say
[48:21] you're gonna we've got to be careful if
[48:23] we get real in accusations
[48:26] angels are afraid to do it
[48:30] let's let's go I gotta get I'm getting
[48:33] ahead of my whole story tonight but go
[48:36] ahead on brother Ernest
[48:38] and his brother hated him to move didn't
[48:40] it man go ahead and he said unto them
[48:42] here I pray you this dream which I've
[48:45] dreamed for behold we are buying we
[48:47] we're binding sheaves in the field and
[48:50] load my shifa rose and stood upright and
[48:53] behold your shoes stood round about and
[48:56] made obesience to my sheep and his
[48:58] brother and said unto him shall thou
[49:00] indeed Reign Over Us or shall thou
[49:03] indeed have dominion over us and they
[49:05] hated him yet the more for his dreams
[49:08] and for his words I'm gonna tell you
[49:12] foreign
[49:18] can make hate amen come to his balling
[49:21] point
[49:26] hate would come to his boiling point you
[49:29] know when when haters take place he
[49:32] ain't got no nice thing to say
[49:36] every time they think
[49:38] they hear the name they call
[49:40] they're going to say something bad
[49:42] negative if somebody tried to say
[49:44] something nice about sister so and so
[49:46] they got a negative thing to say
[49:52] well well sister Renee she just oh no
[49:56] she ain't that I remember sometimes on
[49:58] and so and so
[50:00] um sister so and so and so oh no
[50:04] you can't say nothing about it but Josh
[50:07] or Josh he does you know
[50:12] y'all ever been around anybody to be
[50:14] negative about everything
[50:16] yo y'all might need to tell it because
[50:18] that's your friend
[50:21] I I I I I can excuse them because they
[50:24] my friend uh you know we we've been
[50:28] friends a long time
[50:30] but just a negative attitude
[50:33] always
[50:34] something negative to say always some
[50:38] can never lift nobody up because why
[50:42] it might ruin their reputation
[50:46] you know what I'm saying
[50:47] because they're always looking for
[50:50] self-gratification and they always want
[50:52] to be lifted up so they would never lift
[50:55] anybody else up
[50:57] are you happy
[51:03] just get their loose up
[51:07] they hated him the more go ahead on and
[51:10] he dreamed he had another dream and told
[51:12] it his Brethren and said behold I have
[51:15] dreamed a dream more and behold the Sun
[51:17] and the Moon and the 11 stars made
[51:19] obesions to me and he told it to his
[51:22] father and to his brother and his father
[51:24] rebuked him and said unto him what is
[51:27] this dream that thou has a dream shall I
[51:30] and thy mother and thy brother indeed
[51:32] come and bow down ourselves to lead to
[51:35] the Earth and his brother when envied
[51:37] him but his father observed the same
[51:41] see his brother envied you know what I'm
[51:45] saying the enmity they was jealous you
[51:47] know but his father observed the same
[51:51] see what I'm saying y'all know the story
[51:53] of Joseph and what happened so we're not
[51:55] going to get into the depths of that but
[51:58] we know in Cain and Abel
[52:00] Cain was jealous
[52:02] of the sacrifice that Abel gained
[52:06] and he had an opportunity to straight
[52:08] nodded
[52:10] but you think he was going to do it
[52:13] you turn around because he was jealous
[52:16] of his brother jealousy is cruel as a
[52:20] what grade
[52:21] he was jealous of his brother he turned
[52:23] around he killed his brother amen
[52:26] amen are you with me
[52:28] jealous you'll take you further than you
[52:30] want to go
[52:32] that's Caleb say
[52:34] the book of James 3.
[52:38] jealousy takes you farther than I'm
[52:40] skipping over the all this
[52:43] about Saul and
[52:45] and David and all
[52:47] and hopefully I may not get back to it
[52:50] but but by the grace of God
[52:54] you got to watch
[52:57] examine yourself because a lot of anger
[53:00] and bitterness speed and built up
[53:02] somebody Did You Wrong somebody said
[53:05] something to you somebody thought
[53:07] something you you just you hear that
[53:10] name and you could have trimmed him
[53:16] not effective you like that you have to
[53:18] tell Lord if you forgive a person
[53:21] forgive them from the heart
[53:24] amen and if you forgive them from the
[53:26] heart then that all that that that that
[53:28] shaking and that nervousness and you
[53:31] don't want to look at them you got to
[53:32] hold your head down you see since it's
[53:34] so and so on
[53:35] [Music]
[53:37] you see brother some sister some other
[53:39] sister

[53:46] almost like something on her own with
[53:49] your hand
[53:52] you know you can't even Shake hand with
[53:54] them why you didn't gossip about them
[53:56] and talk about them and say it all kind
[53:58] of nasty stuff about them and you
[54:01] but they got the problem
[54:03] they have the problem
[54:07] but when you done all kind of stuff you
[54:10] can't even look a person in the face
[54:12] why because you thinking in your mind
[54:15] that they are your worst enemy
[54:18] that they are your biggest problem
[54:21] you know you you want to be a victim
[54:24] somebody hurt me somebody done me wrong
[54:27] or somebody doesn't care oh no oh God
[54:32] got to stop that crime
[54:35] come to maturity
[54:38] see sometimes we we cry because we want
[54:41] to be the victim
[54:45] and we want the attention
[54:49] I want attention
[54:52] why
[54:53] it's a spirit the spirit of jealousy I'm
[54:57] gonna show you what the spirit of
[54:58] jealous and envy would do
[55:01] you know
[55:03] it's chaotic
[55:05] it's very chaotic
[55:07] you let a spirit of jealousy get among
[55:09] the people and you're gonna have a a
[55:12] chaotic place
[55:16] I've had people in Ministry and people
[55:18] in life and they were jealous and I'm
[55:22] gonna tell you something
[55:26] can I go with you I said no but I didn't
[55:29] have nothing there I said no you
[55:32] that would be too many or something but
[55:34] you know that person
[55:36] I hate it
[55:39] and goals before you and tell everybody
[55:42] brother send me that
[55:46] you see what I'm saying
[55:47] because why
[55:49] a jealousy because why you can't take me
[55:53] why I can't go with you why I can't do
[55:58] this why why you choose them over me
[56:01] I see what I'm saying jealousy
[56:05] why did God accept
[56:08] evil and then accept mine why Joseph
[56:12] have to be more spiritual than all of us
[56:16] can you see a church the church didn't
[56:19] have a 12 members but you can you see a
[56:21] church with 12 members and all them
[56:23] brothers
[56:26] but one of the brothers seemed to be the
[56:28] biggest problem
[56:30] but he wasn't a problem
[56:33] but it was a spirit of what
[56:35] a spirit of jealous that got in there
[56:37] ruined the whole church
[56:41] guess what they they thought they're
[56:43] going to get rid of that problem
[56:45] their problem with Joseph so they sold
[56:48] him
[56:49] let's get rid of our problem
[56:52] are you with me
[56:53] see what happens I'm gonna tell you if
[56:56] it's a bad Spirit on you I don't care
[56:58] where you go and who you connect with
[57:02] you're going to run into the same thing
[57:04] because you carry the spirit of jealousy
[57:08] and that Spirit has to be dealt with
[57:11] and when that spirit is not dealt with
[57:14] you know we try to be oh I'm so humble
[57:18] I'm so sweet I'm so kind
[57:21] but in the heart I can't stand
[57:24] I can't stand her she thinks you're cute
[57:28] she thinks she looked better than
[57:29] everybody else you do look better than
[57:30] you though
[57:33] it don't ain't no harms a lot of folks
[57:35] look better than me
[57:39] that's an absent fella
[57:43] I mean I can't help because I got a big
[57:45] nose
[57:46] and a little belly and all that
[57:52] [Laughter]
[57:55] all right but I ain't jealous of brother
[57:57] Dave
[58:00] see what I'm saying but we we think they
[58:03] got to be jealous it's got to be enemies
[58:06] you see what I'm saying or somebody
[58:08] because they think they look they think
[58:10] they look better than me
[58:13] think about you
[58:15] are you with me ain't had nothing to do
[58:18] with how they look
[58:20] you know oh this one can play better
[58:23] than me don't even say any better than
[58:25] me they can sing about how can I change
[58:27] them
[58:28] be quiet they can't sing better than you
[58:33] but I no you can't play better than them
[58:36] oh yeah
[58:37] yes I know you can't
[58:41] you can't see sometimes folks don't want
[58:43] to hear the truth
[58:44] but you just tell them the truth anyhow
[58:46] but sometimes oh that's my friend I
[58:49] ain't gonna tell her the truth yeah I
[58:50] think you can do you telling that lie
[58:52] now you got a lying spirit
[58:55] you should have went on and told him I
[58:57] ain't gonna say nothing
[59:00] I ain't getting into that now
[59:03] are you with me
[59:04] and you better pray for
[59:06] because they need to be if you're a real
[59:07] friend you just tell them
[59:10] they can't say any better than you
[59:13] let's see what they still be your friend
[59:17] yeah I thought you were gonna say
[59:19] something like that because you like
[59:20] them better than me
[59:21] that's the first thing they're gonna say
[59:23] why
[59:25] and you know they're gonna say that
[59:28] and they're gonna find a way that they
[59:29] ain't gonna keep no company with you
[59:30] either
[59:32] so you don't lost your best friend
[59:35] are you with me even if you've got a
[59:38] sister in your own family
[59:43] that think they can do this and that
[59:47] everybody got to take they jump
[59:50] because they Superior
[59:53] are you with me
[59:54] Brothers you know sometimes the person
[59:57] that wants superiority is not the one
[1:00:01] that needed
[1:00:02] the one that's the humble this one
[1:00:05] that's the one that needs
[1:00:08] the attention that's the one that needs
[1:00:10] to be exalted but the one that's
[1:00:11] exalting got everything you know that's
[1:00:14] the one need to be humble
[1:00:16] are you with me
[1:00:17] because God resists the what
[1:00:20] he gives grace to the world
[1:00:22] humble
[1:00:24] notice the humble may not
[1:00:26] they may need some attention they might
[1:00:28] need something but they're not they're
[1:00:31] not gonna voices why it's humility that
[1:00:33] keeps them that keeps them humble and
[1:00:36] God's Own time God to give them what
[1:00:38] they need
[1:00:39] God would exalt him in due season if
[1:00:42] they just stay humble and stay in the
[1:00:45] will of God God will bless him
[1:00:47] but as many if we get out of our
[1:00:50] humility and get out of the harmlessness
[1:00:53] of the heart
[1:00:55] and the meekness of the Lord and the
[1:00:57] kindness of the Lord and the gentleness
[1:00:59] of the lord we get out of there man we
[1:01:01] get it out of we're getting out of our
[1:01:03] homeland
[1:01:04] we're getting out of the word
[1:01:06] we got to stay there
[1:01:08] amen be humble before the Lord
[1:01:11] be humbly humbleness of mine

[1:01:50] taking nothing on my children taking
[1:01:51] nothing off of nobody

[1:02:06] sometime all that you ain't nothing but
[1:02:08] dirt

[1:03:25] the Lord
[1:03:26] that takes care of all the bad and tough
[1:03:29] and rough people but we are children of
[1:03:31] God
[1:03:32] amen when children of God not because
[1:03:35] the preacher preached that not because
[1:03:38] the bible say that it's just because
[1:03:40] that's what we really are
[1:03:42] we cannot help ourselves because the
[1:03:46] love of God we've been born into a
[1:03:48] kingdom amen in this kingdom is the
[1:03:52] Kingdom of Light it's not Darkness he's
[1:03:55] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:03:57] and translated this into the kingdom of
[1:03:59] his dear son so we act like Christians
[1:04:02] we conduct ourselves as Christians we
[1:04:04] can't help because we've been born again
[1:04:08] and when you were born again your
[1:04:10] conduct is different
[1:04:12] you can't help from being different
[1:04:16] if you were still a sinner yeah yeah try
[1:04:22] when you say you say Lord help them but
[1:04:24] God forgive them Lord have mercy on this
[1:04:26] soul
[1:04:28] not unless they catch you off guard
[1:04:30] Lord have mercy
[1:04:32] they catch you all God
[1:04:34] or one of your
[1:04:36] full moon days
[1:04:41] foreign
[1:04:42] and then look out
[1:04:44] you know what I'm saying you know every
[1:04:47] day and all day long you ain't in the
[1:04:50] spirit
[1:04:51] sometimes if you ever slip one in on you
[1:04:55] are you with me
[1:04:56] you ain't prayed up that way you ought
[1:04:58] to be prayed up
[1:05:00] and then they come oh Lord thinking that
[1:05:02] and hold on
[1:05:04] huh
[1:05:06] and then you'll be crying Lord please
[1:05:08] forgive me love please forgive me
[1:05:10] because why I I active out of character
[1:05:14] I shouldn't have said what I said
[1:05:18] I've acted out of character
[1:05:20] and not all I can do is repent and ask
[1:05:23] God to forgive me and actually
[1:05:25] individual forgive me I've acted out of
[1:05:27] character
[1:05:29] but you know some people ain't gonna
[1:05:31] forgive you now
[1:05:32] they're gonna act out of character too
[1:05:35] because you acted out of Courage you
[1:05:37] don't mean
[1:05:38] God just had to bring some things at you
[1:05:41] to get you a deeper walk with him he
[1:05:44] allows us to make mistakes and have he
[1:05:47] allows us to make certain phase that
[1:05:50] because he's trying to perfect us
[1:05:53] he's bringing us into gratuity sometimes
[1:05:56] a child will fall fall fall but after
[1:05:59] why that child gets strong enough to
[1:06:01] what walk and that's the way God allows
[1:06:05] us you know sometimes we it don't mean
[1:06:08] that we're not born again it means that
[1:06:11] we need to come to maturity and God is
[1:06:14] trying to bring us there by showing us
[1:06:16] our weakness in our failure and when we
[1:06:20] fail him we immediately repent and ask
[1:06:23] God for forgiveness and Lord I'm sorry I

[1:08:12] envying and strife is there is confusion
[1:08:14] in every evil work
[1:08:19] and the main person talking about all

[1:14:08] is from above is first pure then
[1:14:11] peaceful okay now see if it's wisdom
[1:14:15] that's from above it's first pure and
[1:14:18] then is what
[1:14:19] peaceful the Bible blessed is The
[1:14:23] Peacemaker
[1:14:25] things that are going to bring peace
[1:14:26] things that gonna bring negative and
[1:14:29] confusion

[1:14:36] going to bring I said no well that'll do
[1:14:39] nothing
[1:14:40] don't have to do nothing
[1:14:42] no because I know where they're gonna
[1:14:44] bring
[1:14:46] I told some pastors don't do this and
[1:14:48] don't do that Bishop Bishop Simmons
[1:14:53] 20 years from then they said Bishop said
[1:14:56] you were right
[1:14:58] but you called me Bishop under the right
[1:15:00] terminology now
[1:15:05] because you to learn what you thought
[1:15:07] would work ain't working
[1:15:09] are you with me
[1:15:12] that's when humility set in
[1:15:15] you know sometimes you can tell your
[1:15:17] children something
[1:15:18] they ain't got there
[1:15:21] but you've done been there and you don't
[1:15:23] been through that
[1:15:24] are you telling them about it ain't
[1:15:27] gonna help them none because they think
[1:15:28] you don't know what you're talking about
[1:15:32] but 10 years later after that I went
[1:15:34] through some
[1:15:35] suffering
[1:15:36] ah Mom I wish you would have told me
[1:15:38] telling me all the time
[1:15:41] but I didn't know yeah you didn't know
[1:15:43] but if you just someone listening
[1:15:46] are you with me
[1:15:49] children obey your parents in the Lord
[1:15:51] for this is right
[1:15:54] are you with me
[1:15:57] folks won't listen you're telling them
[1:16:00] for their own benefit
[1:16:02] and I I look at brother carry on I said
[1:16:05] brother really love his people
[1:16:07] really love the conjugation but I said
[1:16:10] man
[1:16:11] I almost tell them man you have a heart
[1:16:13] attack in here
[1:16:15] you know dealing with certain spirits
[1:16:18] caring so much about the people but
[1:16:20] sometimes people
[1:16:22] they just gonna do what they're going to
[1:16:24] do
[1:16:25] you can love them all you want and try
[1:16:28] so hard to get them to do the right
[1:16:30] things but people you have on their mind
[1:16:34] when I get 18 I'm getting out of mama
[1:16:38] daddy house and I'm gonna smoke me a
[1:16:41] cigarette
[1:16:42] they have it in their mind they don't
[1:16:44] have it in their mindset whatever 12
[1:16:45] years old
[1:16:47] some of them have it in there when
[1:16:49] there's 10
[1:16:51] what they gonna do
[1:16:53] and it'll get bigger as they get older
[1:16:57] are you with me the demon growth
[1:17:01] and you think all the word that David
[1:17:03] handed and been preaching and no they
[1:17:07] didn't hear nothing all they heard was
[1:17:09] that Devil's whistling in their ear and
[1:17:11] every time that word was supposed to hit
[1:17:13] them I got to go to the bathroom
[1:17:17] and that word was sent right to him then
[1:17:19] jump up and run to the bathroom because
[1:17:21] that Devil's knows it's Gonna Knock that
[1:17:23] devil out of me
[1:17:24] but they going to the bathroom then
[1:17:27] you see
[1:17:29] and God had a special word just for them
[1:17:31] and they went to the bathroom just in
[1:17:34] time for the word they're missing why
[1:17:37] because it's a spirit in them that
[1:17:38] didn't want to be cast out
[1:17:41] are you oh you put him to sleep
[1:17:45] I ain't saying that because somebody's
[1:17:47] sleeping tonight
[1:17:50] but it does those things
[1:17:53] you can preach your heart out but I'm
[1:17:57] gonna tell you something it's better for
[1:17:58] you to pray
[1:18:00] for your children pray earnestly on your
[1:18:04] knees cry not to God it's better to pray
[1:18:08] and say Lord Lord Lord you say oh bless
[1:18:12] him and your children are grown now
[1:18:14] because you have to pray harder now
[1:18:19] no you pray harder now you pray harder
[1:18:22] than you ever pray why
[1:18:24] because you you know it don't take my
[1:18:28] one mistake
[1:18:30] just one mistake
[1:18:32] and the devil got him
[1:18:35] from that time
[1:18:40] y'all see what jealousy calls Joseph
[1:18:42] brother to do to him y'all see what
[1:18:44] jealousy calls Haman to do the medical
[1:18:46] Malachi
[1:18:49] he hated all the Jewish people because
[1:18:51] he was jealous about a guy Mordecai
[1:18:54] are you with me so he wanted to wipe out
[1:18:56] the whole Jewish race
[1:18:59] you see what jealousy called the
[1:19:01] Pharisees and sightseeing to do to Jesus
[1:19:03] because Jesus was doing those Miracles
[1:19:05] and Healing The Sick giving sight to the
[1:19:07] Blind and all of those things they
[1:19:09] jealous they they were saying to him so
[1:19:12] much they took a murder they took
[1:19:13] Barabbas they took a a one that you know
[1:19:17] deserved to die but they wanted Jesus to
[1:19:20] die and let him go free
[1:19:24] jealousy
[1:19:27] jealousy
[1:19:29] jealousy is cruel as the grave I'm gonna
[1:19:32] tell you something if you let a jealous
[1:19:34] Spirit get a hold of you Brothers can be
