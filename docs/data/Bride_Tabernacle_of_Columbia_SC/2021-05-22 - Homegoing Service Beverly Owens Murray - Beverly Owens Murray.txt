could be here all day talking about miss murray so let me preface by good afternoon family and friends my sincerest condolences and prayers at this time of bereavement caring loyal beautiful god-fearing humble faithful altruistic are just a few attributes that come to mind when i think of miss murray the old adage people come into our lives for a season a reason and a lifetime i met miss murray seven years ago at hopkins middle school i knew there was a reason and we will be in each other's lives for a lifetime miss murray always gave more than she took she was the kind of person who always wanted you to be all right whether it was feeding you clothing you providing you with comfort in your time of need she not only gave us her time she gave us her talent and her love and i gave her her flowers when she was here we ate lunch every day at work together when we had a chance so this is the poem that i wrote for miss murray we knew little that morning when god called your name and life we loved you dearly and death we will do the same our hearts broke when we lost you you did not go alone for part of us went with you the day god called you home you left us with beautiful memories your love is still our god and though we cannot see you i know you'll always be by my side our friendship chain is broken and nothing seems the same but as god calls us one by one i know our chain will link again good morning um i too had to write down my my thoughts and my feelings so that i could keep my emotions in check but beverly owens murray was a loving daughter a gracious sister a devoted wife an auntie a friend a godmother and my mom she was a nana to my children blood couldn't have made us any closer and any thicker and you couldn't have told her i wasn't her child or that my children weren't her grands she was a second mother figure to so many children that she assisted on a daily basis she had a heart like no other and oftentimes caring for others and putting them before herself even when she wasn't okay our beverly was a blessing to everybody she was encouraging to so many of us and she was a vessel to the young people that she interacted with she taught them she encouraged them she loved them and spread the word of god and loved wherever she went she was always energetic and was full of life her spirit was very contagious she was righteous in her ways she was loving to her family and friends beverly yearned to be with the lord and she's now in his loving arms and protection on behalf of the owens murray family we thank you for your kind words thoughts and prayers during this time i just ask that you keep us covered in strength and lifted in prayer in the days to come we love you all our favorite scripture that we both loved so much that i have it permanently on me the lord is the light in our salvation for whom shall we fear the lord is the strength of our life and whom shall we be afraid just keep us covered in strength and prayers at this [Applause] time amen praise lord um brother girl asked me to get sister bowie to say something but she said i can't stand up here and say anything but sister bowie and sister beverly were real close and they talked all the time and even the the last day they spoke for over two hours that day and she said she was ready she told sister bowie is i call her grandma she's my mother-in-law i just call her grandma but she she said that uh sister beverly said i'm ready and uh praise the lord he took her that day but she put some things down on her relationship and i told her i'd read it for a man amen to me she was one of the best friends anyone could have no matter when you saw her she's always the same i never seen her upset nor angry one of her favorite sayings was girl i tell you and then like grandma said she'd kick her head back and start talk talk talk talk then she started talking and talking and talking the good thing about it is she always talking about the lord how good he is all the miracles that he did in her life and how he brought her out of the world and how the lord blessed her and her husband and how the lord put them together and she just loved cooking for brother gerald brother got spoiled sister beverly was a sister of all traits there was nothing she couldn't do she did her best to help me and my granddaughter to learn how to sew she helped us with cooking and one of the best things she loved the most was singing for the lord she would give her all all to the lord from her heart there's nothing that she wouldn't do for you she just loved doing for people taking care of ones that were sick and needy sister beverly on the day that the lord came and took her home we talked about how she was saying that it was no it didn't matter when the lord came for you you got to be ready i believe we talked about two hours that day when the lord came and got her there is so much i could say i lost one of my best friends in the lord amen and then just my little pieces sister beverly was always smiling if you saw sister beverly her countenance was always uplifting she was sincere she was giving every time she came by the house or every time grandma would come she'd always bring bringing something to the house i said praise the lord she was a given sister and she could sing even after she was bedridden for i don't know how long and then she came to the fellowship here and she gave her testimony and then brother simmons put her on the spot asked her to sing we didn't know if she had strength or not but the lord blessed that sister with a gift she could sing and she sang from her heart she was blessed we were blessed to have her amen so with that we're going to ask sister isetta anderson to share a song with us at this time amen i just want to say this truly is a privilege and an honor for me to be here to celebrate the life of sister beverly she was a beautiful person and certainly that smile stood out most of all we love you all i'm kind of home seek for a country to which i've never been before no sad goodbyes there will be spoken [Music] for time won't my [Music] anymore [Music] you love [Music] and someday [Music] love [Music]

you'll be with our brother gerald today this family today was in your comfort hearts you'd strengthen them well father we know oh god that you said we can cast every care upon you because you care for us but right now we trust you and god we thank you today for the word of grace help us today to move out of the way that you can speak word to confident words of life in jesus christ's name we pray amen we do honor the lord jesus christ and the ministers of the gospel and the support from all of you the family we thank god for this family and we've been here a number of times even if not at this church at other churches and we thank god for owen's family and murray family we thank god for sister beverly coming this way for the juror we thank god for them it's been a blessing and it would continue to be a blessing for what we leave behind the testimonies the things that god has done it'll keep on living so we want to say a few things i've heard so many wonderful things about sister beverly and and hearing those things uh i began to re reflect back a few years ago she had an operation and the doctors did all they could do and she was diagnosed with terminal and during that time and eugeno was going through her troubled times and gina had went completely blind and they diagnosed her with she'd probably never see again if she did she would just only see it just so slightly and god miraculously healed her and she was able to drive again and so she was so happy that god had healed her but not knowing that she was going to have some trouble times now mind you beverly probably didn't even tell eugene what she was going to and it was many times she was taking care of eugene and she was already diagnosed terminal and cheaper didn't have much time but god blessed her to go and i'm talking about tireless time day and night taking care of eugene and she worked hard she loved her sister she loved her family a lot of times we were there with her sometimes just about every day with the eugenia my wife would stay on the phone sometimes off and on all night and we knew what badly i had to go through but nobody knew i thought some of the family knew they said no she didn't let them know and i didn't you know to beverly she was healed i'm here nevertheless she told us the diagnosis and she accessed it continually praying because she was healed and by the grace of god she did not any different she said she was healed she acted like she was healed so she went back to work and she took what the doctor said she saw my heels they wanted to do disability she says i'm healed so it it took her so long before she just say well i just do the disability thing but by the grace of god it took something out of her just to say okay this is what they want me to do but if it's up to beverly no matter how what she was going through she was going to stick to the word he was wounded father transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed [Applause] so she kept that testimony that i'm healed amen she didn't want to confess what they say she want to confess what the words say i'm healed so by the grace of god um she i was there praying for her grandmom and she was taking care of grandma and that was a tireless time she was just all the way to the end and we would come by and we would pray with grandmom and and beverly would be there taking care of her not knowing it after she got through taking care of grandma it's time for her to take care of eugene and then it comes to her but i thank god for the saints and every one of you that sister boy that took time out of her schedule to come and stay with her deadly and to to she could just get back enough strength to move and do what she needs to do at the house and the different ones sister keisha lee sometimes they don't want me to say but i think i was proud of the i'm very much proud of the saints that that was there my wife that was able to be there all the way until the end and i appreciate this thanks i know brother gerald appreciate the saints they were there amen i think um mandela you know andela this she was there amen and i thank god many times she would be the one that could tell you she didn't know the fullness of things but she was there amen and i appreciate that amen so by the grace of god i don't want to hold you up but i wanted to tell you that a person that could go through stage four cancer and working tirelessly to help others then i'm not here to feel sad today i'm not here to hold my head down i know i know we're going to miss him i was trying to get my daughter to see could she get the last testimony in the last song that she's saying she said i want i'm trying working hard jairu got here a little late and i was dependent on him to do it for me because she did the best she could she said somehow she'll get it to y'all the testimony and the last song one of the last songs she sing so by the grace of god i told brother gerald that we're going to try to do that today but we're what navel so by the grace of god and that's what i wanted before i got up here i wanted y'all to hear her and to hear her saying one of the last songs but nevertheless let's for a short message i i i'm not good at talking but i said i'd rather just go and preach but by the grace of god words of comfort coming from um ii timothy 4 and 6. before i read again can we bow again father i thank you for your word i thank you that you can give strength you can give utterance and lord you can speak to this people god because god i'm feel loved by i just feel a little full noun lord i don't know just look like i gotta hold back to tears because it's not so much it's just tears that we're gonna miss someone that felt pretty close to and father i just pray that you help us help us to be able to speak today because i need your help now in jesus name amen first timothy 4 and 6 says for i am now ready to be offered the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearance i said sister beverly finish her coats i finished my course she has finished the course you know it's not sometimes how you begin it's not how long you run but are you able to finish i finish my course i was called early this morning and they was telling me that one of the members of the church i pastored in mullins the grandmama talked to her this morning and she said my 18 year old grandson got killed last night she says it's hard i says i know it we prayed with her and i thought about the daughter and what she was going through the mother and i thought about at 18 he finished you don't know when your time is coming and you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow life here it's like a vapor we're here today and we're going tomorrow job styles a man that is born of a woman but a few days and full of trouble life is short somebody said i got a raise to run oh god children got a restaurant i've seen many start running some ran so hard till they didn't last a year they gave out they gave in but there's a finishing line paul was looking at his destiny and a prophet by the name of ajumbo agabus he saw in a vision and he came to tell paul his destiny and he was telling the striving what was going to befall paul and he said save that the holy ghost is witness in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide paul was looking to a place that it wasn't good news but to paul he looked at it and he stared his destiny in the face and he said none of these things move me neither can i my life dear to myself so that i might finish my course paul knew he had a course to finish but he said in timothy as he looked at the young man and he was getting ready to go off the scene he he told timothy he said the time of my departure is at hand and he said i'm ready to be offered up in other words he was saying farewell i'm getting ready to go i believe that such a bevel in her own way was saying farewell the time of my departure is at hand she came by my wife's job a few days ago it was our anniversary and mother's day and all that and she said i want to bring you flowers and i said she says she said to me my wife says beverly knew beverly knew that her time was at hand she was trying uh some of you might reflect that she was trying to tell you that the time of my departure is at hand she said brother simmons i wasn't quite ready but she said i'm ready now she said i'm ready now and i want to tell you family he she said i'm ready now praise god she went through enough afflictions amen tell you she was always there trying to help somebody else and worried about somebody else's problems i said bill said beverly please stop that you you are the doctors just saying you got a few days to be here and you you telling i said just stop it she said but um my brother i uh he had a stroke and and she was concerned about him and then she was telling about this one and that one i said right so the beverly i i don't want to hear let's just think about you now but you think she could quit no way for her to quit she gonna think about you call you check on you checking on that one i said no you're not supposed to do that you're supposed to just zero in on you and that's it she couldn't stop so i just i just throwed up my hand that's that's all right this is belly she's going to be concerned about everybody else so i might as well just stop telling her just forget about everybody else let's let's just let's just think about you now are you with me so brother and sister paul says i finished my course i you know it's something to fight amen but not to fight a good fight amen but she said i fought a good fight amen praise god hallelujah amen i gave the devil a run amen we had some battles enough he punched me but i punched back amen praise god i didn't let him get away with it praise god i came back strong i finished strong praise

god and my savior yes there's nothing between me and my savior nothing between are you with me praise god but i'm saying to you if there's anything between amen if there's anything that's between you and god but she says there's nothing between amen i said let's get amen let's get it straight because one day amen and sister badly ran her race finish her coast amen you got to run and she fought her fight you got to fight your fight praise god and amen if he punts you amen how are you going to respond if the light billows begin to roll how are you going to respond brother and sister amen i know

about where is home hey man home is in they met right now she took a a little stop off in the sixth dimension amen that's beneath the altar that's before you go up to the seven dimension where god is
