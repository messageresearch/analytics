revelation 5 as we stand for the reading of the word we god is so wonderful amen 5 and 1 revelation 5 and 1. and i saw in the right hand of him that set on the throne a book written and within and on the backside seal with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book needle to look their own and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book need them to look their own and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and low in the midst of the throne and all and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it was slain had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set it upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hops of gold golden vowel full of the odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindreds tongues and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall what and we shall reign well god bless you may you be seated it's very important we were uh dealing with the kingdom age we dealing with the millennium time and uh as we just continue to deal with the kingdom age we see how it's intertwined in here because he said he made us in the 10th verse he's made us unto our god kings and priests he's made us into our god kings and priests and in the millennium we talked about uh the kingdom age where the kingdom of god was set up amen and we realized that there is a period of time amen that god will uh jesus would reign as son of david and to set on the throne of david so this is the period of time after the great tribulation period that we call the millennium we call it and those feast days the feasts of tabernacle with god with tabernacle and we're talking about the the period of 1 000 years uh that would be we're still in time remember that we move from time to eternity but the thousand years is a time period so we're still dealing with time but that is the eternal age that's coming because time would be no more i mean we won't we would not be dealing with time amen but we're still dealing with time because and isaiah said a little child will die a hundred years old so you're still dealing with time but you and i he meant steps out of time we stepped into eternity because once you're born again and once you really receive the baptism the holy ghost amen then god says you within you you have within you the kingdom of god within you amen but i want you to see your position in christ your position this morning in christ who you are positionally placed in the earth today amen as god amen comes to claim his possession he comes to claim his amen church he came to claim that which he purchased with his blood so here we're talking about uh god the one that's worthy to claim amen he was worthy to claim and take the book because nobody was was worthy the only one was worthy amen it was he had to be a kinman redeemer the angels could not do it because they were not kin to the human family so he typed it out in boaz and ruth amen boaz was the nearest kinman to roof and he claimed the gentile bride are you with me amen so we understand that naomi amen which was the type of the jews when he claimed naomi he got roof also and have a gentile bride so in this age christ i mean boaz which was a type of christ has come amen to claim amen which is christ come to claim his bride are you with me but you had to be a ken business amen so he says here he said no man was able no man it was able to take man sin so man lost the title deed uh the abstract kind of deed went back into the hand of the original owner amen so what happens was man had lost his dominion he had dominion god gave him the earth and everything and he had dominion over everything so man was you know he had it blown to him but he lost it he forfeited it when he uh believed the lie of the devil are you with me so it was a loss amen so when man fell everything else fell amen the whole earth everything began to die the trees died animals everything began to get out of care uh it would get out of cater everything was just rapidly going down okay so uh here it says in the 10th verse he made us kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth see a lot of folk when they go to church they just looking to go to heaven they don't realize that the scripture said we shall reign where on the earth when is that going to take place see because the jews are very much interested master will die at this time restore the kingdom because one time they had the kingdom one time israel ruled over the nations amen they were in power and they they they fell they met when babylon came in and uh never canelza they came in and they always do the jews amen took over through jerusalem and so forth and they took them in captivity and daniel was over in captivity amen and uh the hebrew boys they were over in captivity and then we find out near mind and the loads went back and they began to build the walls and so forth so uh when we talk about the rubber ball and the seven horns and the seven eyes and so forth and the rebuilding of amen jerusalem in the natural amen restoration now we also talking about those seven eyes which is seven seals and they meant seven horns and that's a power to seven church ages are you with me so by the grace of god uh in the seven church ages amen god was restoring back amen that which adam had lost god promised that he would restore amen everything that adam lost so we're talking about you knowing your position as kings and priests and getting your redempted rights are you with me remember what i'm saying your redemptive rights amen what adam laws amen the redeemer has paid the price okay now let's just look at revelation 1 and 6. maybe i try to talk to you and i it it could get a little complicated caleb she always sitting in the right place he forgot all about what i told him you're sitting in the right place okay okay one and six it says and he has made who he's made we're talking about the kingdom eight he's made who you remember john came preaching to what the kingdom of what the kingdom of god the kingdom of heaven is at hand isn't that right john was preaching amen about a kingdom so if john is preaching amen and john was preaching the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen but the reason why the jews rejected the king other than that if they would receive jesus christ then the kingdom would have been restored then but they're rejecting them amen but that was all in the purpose and in the plain of god if they could have received and the bible said they were blind for our sakes isn't that right so the that the gentiles could come in but we as a wild olive tree amen in romans 11 we were grafted in amen praise god we were wild we were gentiles but god granted us in amen well we are not to boast against the root are you with me because they were the rule amen and we were grating in to the olive tree amen so by the grace of god god blinded israel for our sakes that they could reject him that the gentiles amen could be fellow and fellow citizens in the kingdom of god god made a way proficient he meant that you and i could be a part of his kingdom are you with me and so by the grace of god he's made us that that brings us to the elevated state we're not just coming to church and we're not just uh church goals or traditional believers amen we are somebody special we are king he made us he made us kings and priests amen i'm going to tell you something amen you're not going to conduct yourself properly if you don't know your position and who you are i i if you don't know who you are the devil can uh you know i i i you know i look at me you know it's something that you allow the devil to make you a subject to his old demonic those demon powers and and have sinned the bible says sin shall not have dominion over you amen god gave you dominion over sin over the devil amen amen god made you amen kings and priests sin shall not have dominion over you but look at us amen people why why do you let the devil lie to you and deceive you and trick you amen the bible said adam was not deceived but the woman being the seed was in the transgression isn't that right praise god now we know that being in adam being in christ which is the last adam being in christ we cannot be deceived because we're in him if you abide in me and my word abide in you you can ask what you will and i'll do it isn't that right so god amen in christ amen as long as you back in adam you're not separated from adam amen the twain become one are you with me so god places you back into christ for by one spirit we are baptized not in two bodies but by one spirit we are baptized into what one body that is christ so the the eve had come back into adam amen and amen you cannot be deceived because adam could not be deceived but the woman being the seed was in the transgression why because adam was the original seed eve was a byproduct of adam are you a man so brother and sister recognizing who you are amen you come back into your position headship has come to the body amen so you have your emit restored dominion god has given you restoration amen oh let me slow down because i want you to understand because you know i look at people i said why are you going people want to look like the devil act like the devil they want to be devils no you know it makes real tears come in my eyes it makes me want to cry that hey all this is available to you all this word all this eternal life and everything and you want to sell it out for muscle meat like you saw soul is birthed right you mean to tell me you ex you know all the devil is often used a little bit of time to have a little bit of fun a little bit of pleasure for just a little season amen a little season and then all of that wasted why because you listen to the devil's lie look the bible the prophet god said if we're deceived we willfully deceive god blinded is grown you know for his for our sakes but if we're blind we willfully blind amen lay out a seal is blind naked and don't know it amen you ought to know better amen because it's given you to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom isn't that right but look like you know we claim to be the bride of jesus christ and look like we don't know no matter are you with me you mean to tell me you know somehow the way somebody knock knocks them locked them sensing somebody amen god have mercy on your soul that you want to be a devil yeah lord the kingdom is yours and you don't want it the kingdom of god is yours and you turn it down to believe that there was a lie brother sister what's wrong what's the matter why don't we wake up can i really amen possess the kingdom can i be a possessor let me see he said he's made us kings and priests amen unto god and his father and to him that be what glory and forever and ever amen let's look at um i'm talking about the kingdom age the kingdom amen what god has in store for you and i it meant as a believers let's go to genesis 14. hopefully i can find out where i supposed to be genesis 14 and 18. genesis 14 and 18. okay read brother caleb it says and mekezid that king of what you got it and merkel that king of salem king of peace king of salem remember we said jerusalem which is above is the mother of us all amen we're not in bondage amen praise god we're not talking about sinai amen we're talking about jerusalem and john said i saw a new heaven and a new earth amen i saw new jerusalem coming down from god jerusalem is the city of our great king isn't that right psalms 48 talk about the great king amen i saw the queen with the king oh hallelujah now what happens you know if we show all of that picture but you can go back over those scriptures amen but i'm talking about the kingdom age it's a beautiful time it's a wonderful time amen solomon rain which is a reign of peace amen no more war amen praise god amen brother sister god brings you into a peaceful state amen the wall amen has been warned you're victorious and your conquerors you've won the devil when he comes up to look at you he's afraid of you now because you have recognized your position as king and priest praise god when you see the king amen he knows he can't mess with you amen because you're a ruler with a rod of mine praise god you've got something to fight with ain't that the sword of the spirit which is the word of god hallelujah so devil look out amen hallelujah you gotta sword in your mouth you can speak the word you got power and authority praise god you walking amen in victory praise god you're walking in faith walking with authority and power because you recognize who you are your position in christ praise god i'm in the kingdom of god amen and we shall reign as kings and priests praise god you have dominion restored praise god your rejected rights restored back to the promises of god back to what adam lost amen walking as sons and daughters of god praise god i'm not of this world my kingdom is not of this world amen praise god but there is a time amen when the physical as we call it the physical kingdom the amen the kingdom of this world have become the kingdoms of our god and of his christ praise god it's going to come a time when praise god this earth that we know this cosmos amen praise god gonna melt with the firm and he the elements gonna melt with the fervent heat and the world that we know now the cosmos the world order and all this demon power shall be burnt as an oven but ii peter 3 said nevertheless we are called into his promise look for a new heaven and a new earth way and dwell in the righteousness are you with me so god amen has something in store but don't let the devil lie to you and talk you out of it praise god don't lose your virginity come on somebody don't let the devil take your virginity for you the virtuous bride of jesus christ are you with me praise god as the word was in mary so the word would be in the bride praise god she is a virgin she has what one huh praise god it's the wound of your mind and warner of your mind they meant let it be impregnated with the word the spoken word is original seed faith come by here and hearing come by the word of god amen your virgin you only have one husband and that is christ paul says i i i've exposed you to one husband even christ for he's your husband and he's the worry you don't take nothing less than that man should not live by bread alone but by what every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god praise god that which comes from the pits of hell rejected praise god i received the words of life praise god because anything else is death oh god y'all see where we at god is bringing us up a little higher so he said to john in in the fourth chapter before we got to the field he said come up here revelation amen come up here amen god is calling us out of laodicea calling us in what you're gonna come you're the overcomers to be positioned in place let me get to genesis that you're overcoming to be positionally placed in your position the overcomers of this age amen in the layout of age which is oh those that hear the voice of the seven angel message amen to positionally place you in your in proper place amen i hope you can hear the voice okay caleb read on it's king of salem amen genesis uh 14 18 king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high and he was what now he was not only king mckesson remember your position amen god looks at you as he looked at me cassidy amen remember aaron's sons they were just a levitical priest amen the bible tells us in uh hebrews 7 it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah with what spoken nothing of priesthood amen but amen but he is our high priest of our confession isn't that right i i wish i had time to go to hebrews but brother fred i ain't got time to tell you a little bit about this mechanic amen the order that god has placed you in a higher order amen that you can be king and priest are you a man so god brings you to a higher order now amen there's one time you either be priests or you either be king but you couldn't be king and priests amen because you had to be a son of aaron to be priests isn't that right but it is evident that our lord spring out of judah they met praise god was just amen spoken moses spoke nothing to priesthood amen but this is you are after the order of meccan today amen you are positionally placed by amen as king and priest are you with me your position oh god read on here and he blessed him and said blessed be abra abram the of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth okay come on what the devil offered you that you don't you don't already have he said he possess a what now what the devil offering you that you don't already have are you with me see the devil i offer you something you fall for it yes you get behind me get behind me satan what you trying to give me the kingdoms of the world like it don't belong to me anyway devil offering you a little bit of money a little bit of fun never get behind me i got i know my position i know who i am you ain't nothing but a liar you can't give me nothing that don't belong to me anyway amen praise god hallelujah but i got to go through my uh uh uh what god has a name for me to go through amen but i'm gonna eventually get what blown to me jesus had to go through the cro by calvary and we got to go through our suffering amen before we reign jesus had to go to cavalry amen that he could lay whole and claim that which god had all which was already his but he went through according to the word he had to be a kingman redeemer praise god he said i i i'm gonna pay the price not for himself as the prophet said he wasn't doing it for himself because he was god but he was doing it to claim his bride god had a purpose and a plan in mind and he wasn't going to let you stay in sin so god wanted to claim you amen a spotless bride a spotless church without spark rank of blemish anything he made it possible through his blood that he can wash and make you white as snow amen that the blood of jesus christ can atone for all of your sins all your mistakes and all you ever done god could atone for that praise god the only reason you stay like that is you don't believe that you're sons and daughters of god but if you ever accept the fact amen you know the devil said you know the son of god you might as well forget it if and then the devil got a trick you know he throw a curveball you know he don't throw no fastball he throw a curve one amen and he'll throw that current ball he said hey if you if you're meant to be saved you're going to be saved anyhow so you know it's just like saying you know if i go out and commit a doctor on my wife my wife's gonna forgive me anyhow what kind of person is that if i go out and run around on them she gonna forgive me anyhow when we do our god like that uh the bible says my little children are writing to you that you sin not but if any man sinned he said i don't want you to go out and do wrong just to go out if you love the lord do you you're not you're not going to do the lord in any kind of way but you know the devil is very tricky and he's very sly he's very crafty and he he can woo you away and all he takes is about a moment amen to capture your attention and get your mind amen off of your position who you really are and then he'll twist you as fast as he can twist you and next thing you know you're doing something but when you come to yourself one thing about a child of god they're not going to stay in the place that the devil got them in they're going to come to themselves a child of god ain't going to stay there well you might not be a child of god you might just blow you might just supposed to go to hell so you might as well enjoy your trip to hell is that the way a child of god i think i'm gonna tell you something when i was a sinner you know out there the devil had me tricked y'all up i mean he could twist you up now i'll tell you the devil can mess you up the devil tell you it especially has been the blood of jesus christ that because you got all this knowledge and all amen god if you was in the mind of god you can't be lost anyway and then if you wasn't there you might as well not try to get there see that's when you get to know too much the bible said when a man think he knew when he know nothing man thinking something winning nothing we don't figure that out a lot like we're so intelligent at the devil playing with you trying to make you do all kinds of twisters and see that's what the devil did eve he kept on that he'll come on that the eyes when she saw she didn't see that the devil got inside of her and tried to show her thing that god is hiding from you you know it's things out there the devil introduced to you that uh put a stronghold and mess your life up and you but you know in the midst of it all god got a way of getting amen even adam back amen god amen god away i'm gonna get you back amen i know what the devil has deceived and lied and i know all this craft in this but that's all right he thought he got you amen but he's not gonna have you amen because you belong to me the prophet god said if there's a desire in you for god amen as long as that desire is there you haven't gone too far amen you see the devil a lie to you until you're going too far but if there's a desire in you for god then god has put that desire there amen if that desire is not there anymore you know you've gone past the limit but if there's a deep calling to the deep then there is a deep to respond there's a god that cares no matter how bad how uh it looks no matter how far you've gone god still cares oh lord possessor you know our ex-kings and priests amen you have dominion and god gave you dominion over amen he said possessor of what heaven and lord have mercy god have mercy but but see abram amen has to recognize who he is amen praise god and you must recognize who you are as sons and daughters of god that you are kings and priests and that you have a a kingdom when your kingdom is not of this cosmo this world order amen but you you you you've inherited a kingdom amen an incorruptible you've been translated collagen said he has delivered us from the what the power of what darkness and he has translated us into the world the kingdom of his his dear son he's delivered us from the power of darkness and he's translated us in the spirit rhyme amen we sat together in heavenly places in christ jesus amen you amen and i by faith in the blood of jesus by faith we are the seed of abraham by faith in christ jesus amen praise god hallelujah you're with me and because you abraham seized your ears of the promises amen praise god and because you're an heir you are a possessor of heaven and earth amen everything god gave abraham he meant abraham was the father of faith amen and abraham seed which is christ amen praise god you are abraham's seed if you're in christ and your ears of the promise all that god was he poured into christ and all the christ was he pulled into you the bride amen so you were possessors of what heaven and earth are you with me so by the grace of god and you see why my tears come in my eyes i want to cry if we really recognize who we are i'm not talking about uh we go out and try to win souls to christ i'm talking about the ones that say well you know i'm a part of bride tabernacle if those ones that say you know if they just came you couldn't get a seat in the building amen because one thing about it a lot of times folks say i am but the action's showing that you know do i really believe it do i really believe who i am am i really taking heave or am i do i really believe it praise god you know we we act like make believers sometimes that we don't really believe who we are amen let the prophet god talk about three kind of believers but you got to be truly genuine believers it doesn't matter what you go through in life you still believe god amen you might stumble you might fall but i still believe god somebody might talk about you somebody might do you wrong but i still believe god somebody might lie on you but i still believe god i'm still trusting sickness might befall your body but i'm still believing god huh i know we're just straight just i'm healed the word of god still right now how many amen arrows or dots the devils go at me i'm still claiming my victory amen healing is mine victory is mine praise god i'm overcomer amen i shall have what god says mine amen i'm a possessor of heaven and there amen it's mine it's mine it's mine oh hallelujah thank you don't let the devil steal because the thief coming to kill the steal and but jesus said i come that you might have life and that you might have it praise god you believe that then trust god trust him with all our
