[44:23] and it came to pass that after these
[44:25] things
[44:27] god did tempt abraham and said unto him
[44:30] abraham and he said behold
[44:34] he am i too
[44:51] and abraham rose
[44:53] up early in the morning and saddled his
[44:56] eyes
[44:57] and took two of his young men with him
[45:01] and isaac his son and
[45:04] [Music]
[45:05] and
[45:06] clay
[45:08] wood
[45:09] for the burnt offering
[45:12] and rose up and went into the place
[45:15] of which
[45:16] god had told him for
[45:25] and abraham said unto his
[45:28] young men
[45:29] abide ye here with this with the ass and
[45:34] i
[45:35] and
[45:36] the lad
[45:38] will go yonder and worship and come
[45:40] again to you 6.
[45:54] and i respect unto abraham his father
[45:59] and said my father and he said here am i
[46:03] my son and he said
[46:07] beca behold the fire and wood
[46:10] but where is the lamb for the burnt
[46:13] offering 8.
[46:24] and they came to the place which god had
[46:27] told him of
[46:29] and abraham built and altered there and
[46:32] laid the wood in order and bound eyes at
[46:37] his son
[46:38] and laid him on the altar upon the wood
[46:41] 10.
[46:47] and the angel of the lord called unto
[46:51] him out of heaven and said abraham
[46:54] abraham and he said here am i
[46:58] 12.
[47:13] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[47:16] looked
[47:17] and behold behind him
[47:20] a ram caught in the thicket
[47:22] by his horn and abraham went and took
[47:26] the ram and offered him up for a burnt
[47:30] offering instead of his son 14.
[47:42] and the angel of the lord called unto
[47:45] abraham out of heaven the second time
[47:48] 16.
[47:59] together
[48:00] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[48:03] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[48:06] in the stars of heaven and as the sand
[48:09] upon
[48:10] she shall
[48:12] and thy seed shall possess the gates of
[48:14] his enemy may god bless you toward you
[48:17] you may be seated
[48:20] and we wanted to talk this morning about
[48:22] possessing the gates of his enemy
[48:25] it's a many things that we were reading
[48:27] that
[48:28] could be brought out this morning but
[48:31] uh possessing the gates
[48:34] of the enemy
[48:37] and we oftentimes tell us our greatest
[48:39] enemy
[48:40] that we're looking at you know back then
[48:43] it was talking about
[48:46] they had to go and possess land and so
[48:48] forth and the enemies would come against
[48:52] uh them and they would have to fight the
[48:54] enemy
[48:55] such as going into battle at jericho and
[48:58] different places and
[49:00] and
[49:02] god would give him victory over the
[49:03] enemy so by the grace of god possessing
[49:07] the gates of your enemy
[49:09] that
[49:10] he told joshua is
[49:13] that your enemies would not be able to
[49:16] stand before you
[49:19] and so by the grace of god we understand
[49:21] that
[49:22] the gates that we were dealing with you
[49:25] know
[49:25] through the week we were talking about
[49:28] the gates of the spirit you know
[49:30] like the body
[49:32] the soul in the spirit we're talking
[49:34] about those gates and possessing the
[49:36] gates of the enemy
[49:37] we're talking about
[49:41] when we deal with the body smell taste
[49:43] hair feel and so forth
[49:45] and then we were talking about
[49:47] in the spirit realm we'll talk about
[49:49] affection conscious memory and so forth
[49:52] and imagination and
[49:55] so affection
[49:56] so those gates and in the soul we're
[49:59] talking about either faith or doubt
[50:02] either you believe god or you doubt it
[50:04] amen
[50:05] and we find out that down in our soul
[50:08] down in the inner man amen
[50:11] if we're really saving we're really a
[50:13] believer of jesus christ
[50:16] then
[50:17] that causes all these other
[50:20] uh imagination conscious memory and even
[50:23] our taste
[50:24] is subject
[50:27] then we bring those under subjection to
[50:29] the spirit
[50:31] amen if we have the holy ghost then
[50:34] of the works of the flesh amen those
[50:37] things that will work against the spirit
[50:39] of god
[50:40] the flesh walls against the spirit and
[50:43] the spirit against the flesh
[50:45] are you with me
[50:46] so we are constantly battling the will
[50:49] of god in our own will what we want and
[50:52] what god wants
[50:54] amen what this flesh wants
[50:56] amen the bible says you know concerning
[51:00] the works of the flesh
[51:01] amen the different things that the flesh
[51:04] desires is not the things that would
[51:06] please god but it would please the flesh
[51:09] and the
[51:10] and the flesh amen is inspired by the
[51:14] devil
[51:16] the devil had you know that's the works
[51:18] of the flesh we're talking about the
[51:20] lusts of the flesh the lust of the eye
[51:24] and the pride of life these things are
[51:26] not of the father but of the world
[51:28] so we're dealing with those things
[51:31] constantly amen what we see amen lust of
[51:34] the flesh what we desire amen that's
[51:38] against the word amen somebody might
[51:41] desire amen because they see it amen and
[51:44] it belongs to somebody else they'll
[51:46] steal
[51:48] somebody a teal for something that
[51:50] belongs to somebody else
[51:53] oh you look man
[51:55] so we'll find that not only not
[51:58] we desire somebody else wife somebody
[52:00] else husband
[52:02] which is against god are you with me
[52:05] so people to have desires
[52:08] they meant that they want to please
[52:10] themselves and not god
[52:13] so those gates amen that we must possess
[52:17] the enemy gate now he said to abraham he
[52:20] said thou see
[52:22] shall possess the gates of the enemy
[52:24] we're talking about the seed of abraham
[52:26] now who is the seed of abraham let's go
[52:28] to galatians 3 16 quickly and
[52:33] as we go to galatians 3 16.
[52:41] galatians 3 16.
[52:49] he says not abraham and his seed
[52:53] word what
[52:54] the promise made he said not unto seeds
[52:58] as of what but as a warm and
[53:02] to thy seed
[53:04] which is what
[53:06] christ
[53:08] so christ was to possess the gates of
[53:11] the enemy
[53:12] now with the bible said the last enemy
[53:14] that shall be destroyed is death
[53:17] death is an enemy to you
[53:19] the bible says there's no fear in love
[53:22] but perfect love cast out fear for fear
[53:26] is of the devil and it has torment
[53:29] so the love of god which is the baptism
[53:32] of the holy ghost that shed it brought
[53:34] in our heart it catches our fear
[53:37] are you with me
[53:38] so the thing amen the devil uses fear
[53:41] against faith
[53:43] but we must your children abraham see
[53:46] the children of faith
[53:48] amen that believe the word regardless of
[53:51] what
[53:53] amen regardless of what we see
[53:55] regardless of how we feel the word of
[53:58] god because we are children of faith
[54:00] faith come by hearing and hearing by the
[54:02] word of god
[54:03] so we have victory in amen but trusting
[54:07] in god unfailing words now as galatians
[54:11] 3 here
[54:12] um
[54:14] in in 26
[54:17] he said i read 25 galatians 3 and 25
[54:21] and
[54:22] but after that faith is come
[54:25] we are no longer under a schoolmaster
[54:29] for
[54:30] ye are all what
[54:33] now how do you become a children a child
[54:35] of god by what
[54:37] faith in what
[54:40] now you say well i
[54:41] it doesn't you know sometimes
[54:44] our lack of interest in in god and
[54:47] understanding who we are amen because we
[54:50] want to be who we want to be
[54:52] amen it doesn't make a difference what
[54:54] god wants us to be we want to be who we
[54:57] want to be
[54:58] so it's not god i i i'm here in this
[55:02] earth it meant doing my thing whatever
[55:04] i'm pleased to do amen it's not what you
[55:08] will why am i in the earth why was i
[55:10] born and what am i doing in this place
[55:14] amen people are not interested in
[55:17] discovering where they come from and
[55:19] where they're going and why they're here
[55:21] for but a short time what is my purpose
[55:24] and what is my journey all about
[55:27] some people just don't care
[55:30] because they just gonna do whatever i
[55:33] seem whatever seemed right in my eyes
[55:36] and i'm gonna live and die
[55:40] not knowing that
[55:41] life is but a vapors here today is gone
[55:44] tomorrow you may be strong today but you
[55:47] may be weak tomorrow
[55:50] are you with me
[55:51] it doesn't matter how you think about
[55:53] what you think about yourself amen
[55:57] you're nothing
[56:00] jesus said without me you can
[56:03] you can you can't do a thing you can't
[56:05] even wake up in the morning
[56:07] but we take our life as though we're
[56:10] it's
[56:10] we have control of it but not knowing
[56:13] we're either under the control of the
[56:16] devil or we're under control of god
[56:19] are you with me
[56:20] the devil amen becomes your father or
[56:23] your master uh uh god becomes amen your
[56:28] ruler amen and the god
[56:31] oh you look man
[56:32] so the one that rules over you amen how
[56:35] do you know who's got the rule who's got
[56:36] the preeminence over you by the one look
[56:39] at your life by the way you live
[56:42] amen yo the things that you desire
[56:46] amen do you desire to please god or do
[56:48] you desire how to please yourself
[56:50] yourself it ain't about pleasing
[56:52] yourself it's about obeying the evil one
[56:58] okay
[57:00] so he says you're children of god by
[57:02] faith in christ jesus for as many of you
[57:05] that have been what
[57:08] the 27th verse but many of you that have
[57:10] been baptized into christ have what
[57:13] you put on christ now the bible said by
[57:16] one spirit are we baptized into one body
[57:20] you know as we said except a man be born
[57:22] again he cannot enter the kingdom of god
[57:25] so we're not the baptism of the holy
[57:27] ghost amen we're just potentially
[57:30] children of god but the holy ghost put
[57:33] you into the body
[57:35] amen if you want to be in the kingdom of
[57:37] god then you got to be born in it you
[57:39] cannot just say well i believe and i'm
[57:42] there the bible says have you received
[57:44] the holy ghost since you believe
[57:47] it means simply believing is just the
[57:50] starting point but you got to continue
[57:52] to believe because he said he that
[57:54] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[57:58] amen because if we say we believe and
[58:00] don't get baptized in the name of the
[58:02] lord jesus christ amen then somewhere
[58:05] the bible said after he saved the people
[58:08] out of the land of egypt he destroyed
[58:11] them because of unbelief
[58:13] they meant so god amen it's not enough
[58:16] just to say i believe amen and don't
[58:19] keep believing
[58:21] but god
[58:23] i've got to get back to my subject
[58:26] but
[58:27] possessing the enemy gate
[58:29] but god has a test after the trial
[58:33] then we prosestigate some enemy after
[58:36] we've been tested
[58:38] see the the the test of your faith
[58:42] the trine of your faith
[58:45] your faith has to be tested to see
[58:47] whether it's genuine
[58:50] what is real
[58:52] amen whether you you mean it
[58:56] it has to be proven god allows us to be
[59:00] tested and proven
[59:03] so it says
[59:07] many of us are baptized in christ have
[59:08] put on christ there's neither jew the
[59:10] greek that needs to born they're free
[59:12] they're neither male nor female but here
[59:14] all what
[59:16] one in christ jesus
[59:18] and if ye be
[59:21] christ then you are what
[59:24] now
[59:25] so i'm talking about you that
[59:27] you know have been baptized in the body
[59:30] then you are abraham's seed now
[59:33] and god says abraham i'm going to bless
[59:36] you
[59:38] amen
[59:39] and you know i wrote something down
[59:42] blessing in the testing
[59:47] god bless you in your testing
[59:50] what you presently are seeing what
[59:53] you're presently going through you don't
[59:55] see your blessing sometimes
[59:58] he said no suffering of this present
[1:00:00] time seemed to be glorious
[1:00:02] but there's a blessing the test
[1:00:06] amen so what happens amen abraham did
[1:00:09] not know
[1:00:10] amen he had done a lot of things
[1:00:12] amen abraham had come a long way
[1:00:17] praise god
[1:00:18] and and in in coming a long way abraham
[1:00:22] must have felt like amen praise god i've
[1:00:25] i left my father
[1:00:27] played a house and
[1:00:29] i left my home
[1:00:31] left my land i left everything i had
[1:00:34] and i come to follow jesus
[1:00:37] amen i left everything to follow him and
[1:00:40] here i am i don't know where i'm going
[1:00:43] but all i know god said i want you to
[1:00:45] abraham i want you to leave your country
[1:00:47] i want you to leave where you've been
[1:00:49] brought up and i want you to uh follow
[1:00:52] me amen
[1:00:53] abraham didn't know where it was going
[1:00:55] he he's adjourned as a stranger
[1:00:58] and see sometimes god i asked you to do
[1:01:01] something that you don't understand but
[1:01:03] he meant something about god when he's
[1:01:06] speaking to you he don't have to tell
[1:01:08] you why and what you know and that's
[1:01:10] what happens because god don't tell you
[1:01:12] amen what he's going to do for you and
[1:01:14] what he's going to do to you amen
[1:01:17] sometimes
[1:01:20] i want to know all about what you're
[1:01:21] talking about before i make a move
[1:01:24] and i want to see whether or not i want
[1:01:26] to do it or not
[1:01:28] amen so god
[1:01:30] he don't have to do that with us he
[1:01:32] don't have to prove to us anything
[1:01:36] all he does he says abraham
[1:01:38] i want you to leave
[1:01:40] i want you to come out from your country
[1:01:43] you know
[1:01:44] sometimes he said okay
[1:01:46] i died not
[1:01:48] now what did i do it for you know we get
[1:01:51] an attitude lord i gave you i i i
[1:01:54] accepted you as my person to save it and
[1:01:56] lord you came into my life and lord
[1:01:59] thank you
[1:02:00] amen praise god
[1:02:02] now amen because i i i i i left my
[1:02:06] friends and amen and i left the things
[1:02:08] that i used to do but lord i i i'm done
[1:02:12] enough
[1:02:13] see sometimes we think we've already
[1:02:15] done enough to be satisfied
[1:02:18] amen now amen god you know
[1:02:21] abraham's journey and he took lot with
[1:02:23] him and okay lot come on
[1:02:26] god didn't tell him to take a lot but he
[1:02:28] took life
[1:02:29] because abraham didn't have no children
[1:02:32] are you what man
[1:02:33] so uh let me take a lot alone with me
[1:02:35] but after a while amen god started
[1:02:37] blessing abraham and blessing a lot and
[1:02:41] and it came to time that god says you
[1:02:43] gotta you gotta get rid of this
[1:02:46] lot i ain't got no children there like
[1:02:49] my son you know
[1:02:51] so you had to get rid of a lot separated
[1:02:53] from life
[1:02:54] so here it must have caused a lot of
[1:02:57] hurt and then
[1:02:58] look like god promised that i'm gonna
[1:03:00] bless you and i'm gonna give you a son
[1:03:02] and a child but look like it ain't
[1:03:04] coming so hey god
[1:03:06] you know you
[1:03:08] you know he was convinced to you know
[1:03:10] have a child i hate god and ishmael then
[1:03:13] god took that child go on separate
[1:03:17] it's different things that god comes in
[1:03:19] our lives and amen even when our failure
[1:03:22] and our mistakes god allows it sometimes
[1:03:26] but yet god has to test you prove you
[1:03:28] and he's taking you on a journey
[1:03:31] and sometimes when we on that journey
[1:03:33] god does not explain to you all about it
[1:03:37] you know you know sometimes we want to
[1:03:38] know the end of it before we start
[1:03:41] before i start on the journey i want to
[1:03:44] know amen the end amen and life is not
[1:03:47] like that
[1:03:49] you know sometimes you you have to trust
[1:03:52] god to navigate you through life just it
[1:03:54] meant to be amen
[1:03:57] the one that's going to lead you amen to
[1:03:59] green pastures
[1:04:01] amen sometimes you got to go through the
[1:04:03] violent shadows of death to get to that
[1:04:06] pasture
[1:04:07] but god is leading you
[1:04:09] in the midst of all your troubles
[1:04:12] god leads
[1:04:14] and god dies
[1:04:17] and sometimes we don't understand it
[1:04:18] because we don't understand we we're not
[1:04:20] going to move
[1:04:24] but abraham must have had something in
[1:04:26] him
[1:04:27] it must have was something about abraham
[1:04:30] that he believed god
[1:04:32] and you know
[1:04:34] it comes crucial points
[1:04:37] in our lives crucial times critical
[1:04:40] times in our life
[1:04:42] and god asks us to do something that we
[1:04:44] don't want to do
[1:04:48] and sometimes the thing that we
[1:04:51] love the most goddesses i want you to
[1:04:54] give that up
[1:04:57] yeah
[1:04:59] some of us love
[1:05:00] different things
[1:05:02] it might be a companion it might be or
[1:05:05] a friend might be you know who you hang
[1:05:09] out with it might be
[1:05:10] uh you know
[1:05:12] it could be
[1:05:13] something that
[1:05:14] would cause you to
[1:05:16] displease god but you you may not
[1:05:18] understand it
[1:05:21] where god is taking you to
[1:05:24] a better place
[1:05:26] he's taking you higher in the spirit
[1:05:29] he's he's actually trying to establish
[1:05:32] you strengthen you
[1:05:34] he's trying to make you stronger
[1:05:38] but you know we just don't start off
[1:05:40] almost running a mile we might run
[1:05:43] you know we might walk a mile first
[1:05:46] and god takes us to different levels to
[1:05:50] make us strong in faith
[1:05:52] it takes us through different avenues to
[1:05:55] strengthen our faith
[1:05:57] and sometimes things that god allows to
[1:06:00] happen in your life amen it causes you
[1:06:03] to wander and causes you to think it
[1:06:05] causes you to uh want to say god why am
[1:06:09] i going through this
[1:06:12] i've seen so many
[1:06:15] young people just turn around and and
[1:06:18] not serve god because
[1:06:20] amen they don't see the progress in
[1:06:22] their lives
[1:06:24] and they don't see the reason for them
[1:06:26] not doing like the rest of the folk
[1:06:31] and why should i be taken advantage of i
[1:06:34] don't see amen why why am i being
[1:06:38] amen uh i can't have what the rest of
[1:06:42] them have
[1:06:43] why i can't do and have fun and have
[1:06:46] pleasure like the rest of the
[1:06:49] other young people why why why why am i
[1:06:51] victimized why am i gonna do without and
[1:06:54] they're having fun and they you know why
[1:06:57] why you want me to do that
[1:07:00] god explain to me why
[1:07:05] can you see some explain to me why
[1:07:09] mama dad explained to me why
[1:07:13] if you can't tell me why then i do what
[1:07:15] i want to do
[1:07:17] and
[1:07:18] and then i you know i might not let you
[1:07:20] know but i'ma do it
[1:07:22] because why
[1:07:24] i want to know why
[1:07:26] not
[1:07:29] and and sometimes we feel like we're in
[1:07:32] prison
[1:07:34] god you
[1:07:35] is not going to make a prisoner of me
[1:07:38] that i can't do this and i can't do that
[1:07:40] and i i'm not going to be a prisoner for
[1:07:44] nobody
[1:07:45] i'm going to be free
[1:07:48] free to do what i want to do free to
[1:07:51] live like i want to live free free from
[1:07:53] everybody free from parents free from
[1:07:56] love
[1:07:58] you know
[1:07:59] are we really free
[1:08:02] when we're free are we really free
[1:08:06] okay we free
[1:08:08] just go down 35 miles an hour and just
[1:08:11] go
[1:08:12] 50 if you want a hundred
[1:08:15] the sign says 35
[1:08:17] free
[1:08:19] okay
[1:08:21] you're free
[1:08:22] go to school
[1:08:26] and you're free
[1:08:28] but you got to have some type of respect
[1:08:31] for those that are trying to teach you
[1:08:34] are you with me
[1:08:36] but you you you have to be subject
[1:08:39] enough and you know i said lord you know
[1:08:42] what happens
[1:08:44] people don't respect anybody almost
[1:08:48] respect has been gone from
[1:08:50] society
[1:08:52] when people can
[1:08:54] disrespect
[1:08:56] any anybody that's have any kind of
[1:08:59] authority at all people disrespect
[1:09:02] authority
[1:09:04] so what it when it comes down to because
[1:09:08] the children disrespect the parents
[1:09:11] the parents disrespect god
[1:09:15] are you open
[1:09:16] but the parents want the children to
[1:09:18] respect them but they don't respect the
[1:09:20] word of god
[1:09:23] are you with me
[1:09:26] i didn't mean to go there but
[1:09:29] by the grace of god let me go back to
[1:09:31] protesting against an enemy
[1:09:34] but respect goes a long way
[1:09:38] being humble
[1:09:40] you tell the teacher teacher why are you
[1:09:42] teaching me this way
[1:09:46] why are you saying that i should learn
[1:09:48] algebra what i'm gonna do with it i
[1:09:50] don't need it anyhow not what i'm gonna
[1:09:52] do
[1:09:54] what why i need
[1:09:56] to learn
[1:09:59] these
[1:10:01] terminologies
[1:10:03] that i'm not gonna use
[1:10:05] and sometimes they say
[1:10:07] okay
[1:10:08] if you want your degree
[1:10:11] then you're gonna learn it you're gonna
[1:10:12] go through it
[1:10:14] well i'm going through all of this just
[1:10:15] to get a degree
[1:10:18] but what is the degree going to do for
[1:10:20] you
[1:10:22] oftentimes it's going to get you what
[1:10:25] a better job
[1:10:27] are you with me
[1:10:29] so if i got to go through this to get
[1:10:31] what i want
[1:10:34] see what i'm saying what god has
[1:10:37] given to you amen sometimes we have to
[1:10:40] go through certain things to get what
[1:10:42] god has in store for us
[1:10:47] god wants to bless us but we can't get
[1:10:50] the blessed until we pass the test
[1:10:56] are you with
[1:10:57] but sometimes we just think that if i'm
[1:11:00] not blessed i ain't gonna do nothing
[1:11:04] you know
[1:11:05] i looked at job he had to be test
[1:11:08] did and i said
[1:11:10] how many times you probably thought that
[1:11:13] job he lost his cattle he lost his
[1:11:16] camels he lost everything
[1:11:18] then he came to it he lost his children
[1:11:22] and now
[1:11:24] he says
[1:11:25] job said
[1:11:27] naked came out to the world next shall i
[1:11:29] return the lord give it to the lord take
[1:11:31] it away what
[1:11:34] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:11:36] amen i'm talking about
[1:11:40] joe probably you know
[1:11:42] you know what what do we say
[1:11:44] i i i've been through enough
[1:11:51] it's enough i
[1:11:54] i can't take it no more
[1:12:00] sometimes the things that we suffer in
[1:12:02] our bodies and sometimes the things we
[1:12:04] suffer through life we say it's enough
[1:12:08] i've been through enough
[1:12:10] i'm tired you know young people give up
[1:12:13] at the early age they blow their brains
[1:12:14] out why because they thought
[1:12:16] i can't take it no more
[1:12:19] because i don't take it because i don't
[1:12:21] understand it
[1:12:25] so we find that people do they just go
[1:12:27] out and they just i'm going to take a
[1:12:29] drink i'm going to take i'm going to
[1:12:30] smoke or join i'm going to do anything
[1:12:32] because i can't take it or they don't
[1:12:34] know where you're coming from
[1:12:36] it's a rebellion against
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:40] the rebellion against the ways of god
[1:12:42] and the plan of god for their lives they
[1:12:44] don't want god's plan they rebel against
[1:12:47] it so i'm gonna do something in
[1:12:48] rebellion
[1:12:53] lord i i don't want this this is not
[1:12:56] what i want i want to do my thing
[1:13:00] so i rebel against god
[1:13:02] and in rebellion we actually do more
[1:13:05] hurt and damage to our own lives we're
[1:13:08] not hurting god because whatever god
[1:13:10] asks us to do he just want to take us
[1:13:13] and bless us
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:20] so even though abraham did not
[1:13:21] understand the
[1:13:23] one that i love and i god gave it to me
[1:13:26] after 25 years going through after god
[1:13:29] had unchanged his body from an old man
[1:13:32] and made him young again took sarah from
[1:13:35] a 90 year old lady and let her come back
[1:13:37] to be young to have a child
[1:13:42] the miracle had it happened
[1:13:45] and you know after the miracles can you
[1:13:47] imagine you walking around with a stick
[1:13:49] 90
[1:13:52] years old
[1:13:54] and abraham 99
[1:13:56] you know walking around then all of a
[1:13:58] sudden
[1:14:00] ah
[1:14:01] oh thank you
[1:14:03] they looked at the mirror and they
[1:14:04] looked cool boy
[1:14:07] i'm back
[1:14:09] 1819
[1:14:12] and then
[1:14:13] sarah looks so beautiful
[1:14:17] here she is back young
[1:14:19] and then all of a sudden
[1:14:21] she's
[1:14:23] for 25 years i've waited and i waited
[1:14:25] and i waited and god made me a promise
[1:14:28] that i'm gonna bless you
[1:14:30] but i didn't see it
[1:14:32] i never saw it
[1:14:34] i'm gonna tell you something you may get
[1:14:36] old and it look like it ain't gonna
[1:14:37] happen things are not gonna change for
[1:14:39] you things are not to happen for you you
[1:14:42] can give up amen
[1:14:44] but if god's
[1:14:47] you can't get out of god's plan and amen
[1:14:49] and actually get the blessing that god
[1:14:51] wants you to have
[1:14:53] sometimes the husband the wife the
[1:14:55] different things that we want in life
[1:14:56] the house that we want the car that we
[1:14:58] want to drive all of that you might say
[1:15:00] well i'm gonna get it on my own
[1:15:02] but you know god said i
[1:15:04] i'ma tell you something you can't bless
[1:15:06] yourself
[1:15:08] like god can bless you
[1:15:12] god can give you greater
[1:15:14] the bible says he's able to do exceeding
[1:15:16] and abundantly above all that which we
[1:15:18] can act as a thing
[1:15:20] are you with me he said eyes have not
[1:15:22] seen here have not heard neither have
[1:15:23] entered into the heart of man the things
[1:15:25] that god has prepared for them that
[1:15:28] love him
[1:15:29] are you a man
[1:15:31] i'm just i'm talking about what god can
[1:15:33] do for you possessing the gates of his
[1:15:35] enemy god can do far above just see we
[1:15:37] settle we settle with things we settle
[1:15:39] with uh trivial things we follow with
[1:15:42] the less than what god wants you to have
[1:15:44] we settle with it and we say well that
[1:15:46] yes yes i'm gonna settle with this amen
[1:15:49] this is what i you know
[1:15:51] this is what i want
[1:15:55] but god wants to give you greater
[1:15:58] greater than what
[1:15:59] but you see
[1:16:01] after the blessing
[1:16:03] after we get to a certain stage of our
[1:16:05] lives at certain stage of our christian
[1:16:07] walk we think
[1:16:09] thank you oh can you see i'm so happy
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:13] okay
[1:16:14] i'm beyond trials intestines now i've
[1:16:17] already proven myself
[1:16:21] so i i've been through enough and now
[1:16:24] it's time you said that i can say oh
[1:16:26] i'm enjoying life now
[1:16:29] hallelujah
[1:16:30] god you finally came
[1:16:32] amen finally done what you say
[1:16:35] then it's time you sat back and relaxed
[1:16:38] whoo
[1:16:39] oh it was what me going leaving my
[1:16:41] father's house and separating
[1:16:43] all the trials and tests and everything
[1:16:46] i've been through oh let me sit back and
[1:16:48] see whoa i'm going to i'm in heaven now
[1:16:52] your heaven is interrupted
[1:16:57] oh you're enjoying playing with isaac
[1:16:59] and teaching him how to hunt fish and
[1:17:01] all that you know he's having a ball
[1:17:05] thank god this is what what oh it's
[1:17:07] worth waiting for amen because you're
[1:17:10] faithful abraham i'm gonna give you that
[1:17:13] child
[1:17:14] oh lord
[1:17:16] praise god aim at the house you wanted
[1:17:18] the job you wanted even the children
[1:17:21] amen god bless you and every
[1:17:23] everything about you
[1:17:25] see we come to a place that we are so
[1:17:28] blessed and
[1:17:29] so satisfied with what god has done and
[1:17:32] look like no
[1:17:34] it's over with no
[1:17:37] and see sometimes that's what happens to
[1:17:39] us
[1:17:41] and god says
[1:17:43] amen at
[1:17:45] no time
[1:17:47] amen do you tell god it is enough
[1:17:52] that i've been through enough i don't
[1:17:55] i'm not going through nothing else
[1:17:58] you know
[1:17:59] sometimes we do that with our
[1:18:01] relationships
[1:18:02] with companion
[1:18:04] i don't took enough off of him
[1:18:07] i don't took enough off of her
[1:18:10] and i ain't taking no more
[1:18:13] and sometimes
[1:18:15] you know we make up in our mind
[1:18:18] that we've taken enough and i ain't
[1:18:20] taking no more but sometimes is that
[1:18:23] what god says
[1:18:26] sometimes what we say what we're not
[1:18:29] going to take
[1:18:31] you know because god wants you to stay
[1:18:33] soft
[1:18:34] and hard and sweet
[1:18:37] let your heart still be soft and sweet
[1:18:40] praise god and say god
[1:18:42] will put no more on me
[1:18:45] you put no more on me than i'm evil
[1:18:49] are you with me
[1:18:51] god wouldn't allowed it
[1:18:53] if he wouldn't give me the strength to
[1:18:54] go through it
[1:18:56] are you with me
[1:18:58] so if god whatever you allow
[1:19:01] praise god let me face it
[1:19:04] with joy
[1:19:07] knowing that the trine of your faith

[1:21:38] glory and being spit on was it worth it
[1:21:44] for you to be called a devil a better
[1:21:46] bug prince of devils was it worth it for
[1:21:50] them to lie on you
[1:21:52] was it worth it for them to take the
[1:21:54] uh the whip and you shall pull your the
[1:21:57] flesh off your back
[1:21:59] was it worth it lord
[1:22:03] praise god

[1:22:26] to go through what i'm going through but

[1:22:44] and sometimes
[1:22:46] don't let me don't don't deceive
[1:22:48] ourselves
[1:22:49] sometimes
[1:22:50] what we go through is because we put
[1:22:53] ourselves in that predicament
[1:22:57] sometimes we put ourselves there
[1:23:00] and god has allowed us
[1:23:03] to work this thing out
[1:23:05] because it's a lesson
[1:23:07] in the blessing
[1:23:09] are you with me
[1:23:11] god is teaching us a lesson in the
[1:23:13] blessing sometimes we have to learn even
[1:23:16] from our mistakes and god might they say
[1:23:18] hey hey there was a lesson that you had
[1:23:21] to gain through your testing
[1:23:24] so god was teaching you a lesson that
[1:23:26] amen don't you do that no more
[1:23:30] praise god you say well i i wish i had

[1:23:45] suffering and not look time i meant
[1:23:49] of regret
[1:23:50] amen i shouldn't have i knew better but
[1:23:54] i did it anyhow and now i'm being
[1:23:59] you think we need being punished
[1:24:03] and we
[1:24:04] sometimes
[1:24:05] well lord now i'm talking about
[1:24:07] suffering for christ's sake
[1:24:09] not suffering for your
[1:24:11] devilishness
[1:24:13] your meanness
[1:24:15] you're disobedient
[1:24:17] amen because you didn't do what you were
[1:24:20] your parents told you to do you didn't
[1:24:22] do amen what this teacher told you to do
[1:24:25] so when you flunked you flunked
[1:24:29] not because you couldn't do it
[1:24:31] because you wouldn't do it
[1:24:33] are you with me

[1:24:56] and what what happened
[1:24:58] that was passed down through the genes
[1:25:02] it was in the seed you couldn't get it
[1:25:03] out amen because amen you caused your
[1:25:06] children to go through certain things
[1:25:08] because it was in the seed
[1:25:13] are you with me
[1:25:14] he said why they going through that
[1:25:18] you could call the blessing
[1:25:20] to your seed
[1:25:22] your children
[1:25:23] and your children after you or you can
[1:25:26] cause a what
[1:25:28] a curse to the third and fourth
[1:25:29] generation
[1:25:31] are you with me
[1:25:33] you see
[1:25:34] my behavior today can cause blessings on
[1:25:37] my children or can cause curses on my
[1:25:40] children
[1:25:41] how i conduct my life is maybe determine
[1:25:46] how what my children go through
[1:25:49] if i don't get rid of my complex
[1:25:52] it's gonna pass on down to the next
[1:25:54] generation the same kind of attitude
[1:25:57] that i had it's going to be in them
[1:26:02] are you hooked man
[1:26:06] i got to close
[1:26:09] possessing the gates of the enemy
[1:26:14] if you want to be blessed
[1:26:17] then you have to realize
[1:26:19] life is a big test
[1:26:24] abraham found out
[1:26:27] it was only a test
[1:26:29] god wasn't
[1:26:31] really gonna want him to offer up isaac
[1:26:35] to kill his son
[1:26:39] but god was testing him
[1:26:43] something
[1:26:44] think about it brother sister what is
[1:26:46] your test
[1:26:48] what are you present now we all through
[1:26:51] life journey
[1:26:53] how you're dealing with it
[1:26:56] what is god saying to you what is god
[1:26:58] saying you and i
[1:27:01] what did he say to us that
[1:27:05] our lives can
[1:27:06] be turned around and get on the straight
[1:27:08] narrow
[1:27:10] get on the right path
[1:27:13] or we can listen to all the outside
[1:27:15] voices
[1:27:17] mama daddies teachers whatever
[1:27:22] people that's trying to help us
[1:27:25] in our lives but we're not listening to
[1:27:27] those voices the right voice
[1:27:34] we listen to all the other voices
[1:27:36] outside influences
[1:27:40] but when you're down in the house
[1:27:45] and you say why did i
[1:27:47] listen to those voices
[1:27:49] why did i listen to
[1:27:51] jesus
[1:27:52] why didn't i listen to that
[1:27:55] right voice the one that was
[1:27:57] pointing me in the right direction to i
[1:27:59] can have a better life
[1:28:01] not to be successful
[1:28:06] tell you
[1:28:08] one day
[1:28:10] maybe soon
[1:28:13] that you'll find out
[1:28:15] the choices you made
[1:28:18] whatever man so
[1:28:20] that show
[1:28:23] you read

[1:28:45] provided

[1:29:06] you
[1:29:08] if you only trust him and believe him he
[1:29:11] knows what he wants to do for you
[1:29:14] he wants to bless you
