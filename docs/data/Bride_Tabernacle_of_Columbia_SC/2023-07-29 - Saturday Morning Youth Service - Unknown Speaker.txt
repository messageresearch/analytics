the old Saints have been passing away I've been in this message a little bit over 30 some years it's a blessing to see all of the youth here this morning oh what a blessing you know that really turns my heart on fire this morning speaking with the brothers over in Africa you know I go to uh the country of United Arab Emirates in Dubai have a business over there and they have big churches but they don't have that many youth in there so it's really good to see you this morning and I'm gonna go back and give them a report that the youth are still on line for the Lord y'all stay online for the Lord [Applause] [Applause] okay how everybody doing uh I ain't the greatest talker in front of people so if I start stumbling and mumbling y'all just bear with me uh I got a kind of long testimony I guess in January everybody say start a year with a bang my starter with a I don't even know it's just so many different things that happened to me in just a matter of months but uh just started off uh in January uh me even a couple of guys from churches helping brother Gordon um move out his house to move back to Columbia to the trip down there having real I was having real bad headaches my eye was just just thumping I'm like maybe I get enough sleep last night I'm just tired I ain't gonna I'm asleep at all wake up in the morning everything gonna be all right so this is on Friday when we finally got down there I wake up Saturday morning and my left eye I couldn't I couldn't barely see on my left eye it looks like a barely I'm just like it's nothing I mean it is what it is you know I'm young I gotta worry about I ain't got to worry about nothing ain't no but ain't nothing and uh as the day went on by my eye just started hurting like more and more and more and by the time we finally got done with everything and made it back to Columbia on Saturday night my vision was completely gone on my left eye I couldn't see and I'm just like all right maybe this might be something a little serious cuz that's not normal and uh go to my text my mom and tell her uh whatever said Sunday morning I said yeah I can't I can't see anything on my left eye we might need to go to the hospital and yeah that's a picture of me in the hospital uh so we went to a first hospital first and they like I'm still thinking this ain't nothing you know they gonna give me some medicine I'll be good by Monday so he goes to the first hospital the first hospital like oh there's something more serious than what we can do here and I'm like oh okay and I'm kind of getting like a little and down I'm like you know this might be a little bit more serious and we finally went to another hospital we sitting in the room the it's one doctor come in I'm like okay the first doctor gonna figure it out we good we going first daughter came in didn't know what was going on they sent another daughter in he came in didn't know what's going on and then they see the third doctor and he she didn't even know what's going on so I'm like I'm like oh this is this is serious and uh um finally the daughter come in and tell us well we're gonna have to have you stay overnight uh well one night ain't that bad I mean that's that's cool but all I mean what after the first night we'd had the uh what the neuro neuro uh neurosurgeon uh come in the room and he came in he's checking me out looking at mine and everything and I'm like it's a new real surgeon he can tell me what it is right off the get-go we could go ahead and get him back on out of here and uh the neurosurgeon come in he's doing his test and everything and he looks at me and he said I don't know what's going on I'm like that ain't good if nobody know what's going on so now I'm like sitting in the room and I'm like I'm just like kind of I mean honestly I was kind of like I'm young I shouldn't have to deal with this like I mean I'm just it just don't make no sense and as the people kept coming in didn't know what was going on uh Pastor Simmons came in he was like I mean nobody like nobody really know what's going on so you got to have faith in like basically almost claim your own healing and just you know do it that way because I mean the daughters don't know what to do and like the doctor know what to do and don't know what else can help you but God that's the only person that can't help you at this point uh but we end up staying there for a couple of more days I just start praying every night trying to listen you know listen to the message and just try to you know really claim my healing the right way not just I'm Healed all right you're like you know you gotta you gotta claim it and uh as the days went on my vision started just like coming back you know slowly but surely and like I said that's what that was like the progress of just claiming your healing was a was it was like I don't know it was good and uh if that if that wasn't enough right there losing your vision and can't see out your eye and that wasn't enough I guess and you know I just started you know trying to follow God a little bit better and I guess the devil's just like you know what he doing too good let's knock him down again few what two months after that I'm uh me and my girlfriend was riding down to my my sister's uh birthday dinner we're riding down the highways raining outside uh we're just driving I'm like it's raining real hard I'm like I'm not gonna speed today I speak most of the time I drink on speed today it's raining outside so I slow down a little bit so I'm going a little bit below the speed limit you know just cruising and uh as we're driving it's a little Nissan Altima just comes on the right side of us and hits the back of my truck and slams the whole truck into the wall and we slam into the wall I black out on the Wheel and we spend in 360 in the highway and my girlfriend says she can see all the cars just coming towards it's almost like it was like a like a standard like right there just making sure nobody hit us and as we're going off the side of the road as I'm blacked out at the Wheel by the time I wake up if you can see in that what that third picture right there that pole if I didn't if I would have waked up a couple more seconds later that pole would have probably been in my in my head but it's just I don't know like I say it's unbelievable how you know how good God is and [Applause] and uh I mean as I seen that picture on uh Instagram the other day and basically in that whole time period I was like in between do I really want to give my all to God do I really want to step into church it's like as a you know I don't know for all young people but I know for me it was a battle because the world looked more appealing than going to church but it's like I guess God just came like they see you running to the lamb like I'm coming to get you like you ain't I ain't letting you go far and that scripture uh that's that scripture right there been on my heart it says for the son of man it's come to seek and save that which is lost which was Lawson and it's like in that time period I was just lost I didn't know I guess I didn't know like what I wanted to do and God said this is where you're gonna go and I say I ain't I ain't perfect I'm still trying to learn some things and trying to live my life in the best way possible but because they've been leaning leaning on him and just gonna keep believing and trusting in Him foreign [Applause] I'm Grace uh I'm the daughter of brother Gordon over there and my testimony starts the beginning of my senior year August 12th I collapsed down on the floor right over there and I started having a seizure I was foaming at the mouth I would violently Shake I would gasp for air and we went to the hospital it stopped on the way to the hospital and we were like maybe it's the Clorox wipes that I use maybe I got alert allergic reaction to that and was like okay just don't use them again you know I was like okay fine about two weeks later the same thing happened but it happened longer I wasn't seizing but I was going in and out I would always my eyes would roll in the back of my head I would lose my sight I could hear all the time I blacked out and I would just lay there and then come back it was like I don't know it was like I was sleeping and then waking up but I could always hear so brother Simmons had prayed for me and were and we were saying that I wouldn't go to school because we didn't know if it would happen again but School hasn't hadn't started or had it it started school started so I had the most violent one that I had was at home I woke up and I was not breathing my sister had to get Mom and Dad and help me to wake up to get up to breathe but I was shaking violently I was shaking my mother I was shaking the bed I was just trying to breathe I was trying to stop shaking it was just terrible after that we went to the neuro neurologist thank you we went to the neurologist and we did an EEG and that's when they put things on your head to see if you're having seizure signs on your brain and I was not having any shown up show up at all and we're like okay that's great so I go to the bathroom because we're about to leave and as I'm washing my hands you know my mother's outside waiting for me and I opened I don't know if I opened the door but I think my mother opened the door I opened the door and mom was like Grace you ready to go I looked at her and I realized I was not moving but in my mind I thought I was and then I fell uh thank God there was a doctor there who was able to see this because you wouldn't believe us because the test wasn't showing that it was happening so a doctor was there they got me in the they got me admitted to the hospital right next door and I had another EEG when I woke up I could talk to you but I'd pass out and still be in the conversation I would pass out and I would answer the doctors came they saw how it was happening and they told me that it was stress from being a senior [Music] I had only been a senior for two weeks and I wasn't even in the classroom yeah so um we did not believe it I can't remember the term right now uh but it was something disorder and mom didn't believe it because they had given mom a paper and on the paper they were saying if she has another episode don't let her do something because it's out of um it's out of spite for what she wants like basically punish her because this is stress and she's just doing this for attention and we did not like that at all so I went home and I started to have it again and we went to the um MUSC a hospital in Charlotte and it this was a movie scene because I could not get up oh sorry before that I was passing out and my brother took me downstairs because I couldn't walk I couldn't walk and my brother was yelling at me wake up and everything and I was just passed out pass out every position you put me in I would pass out or I couldn't breathe and for some reason I don't know but Paul had lifted my leg my older brother and I woke up and then he dropped it and I passed out and then Paul was like Mom look at this because I can hear everything now even though I'm passing out Paul lists my leg I'm awake I can see he drops it again I'm out so God bless Paul Paul did a lot for me um so for I don't know about 20 minutes he's just standing there holding my legs so I'm awake and conscious and Mom and Dad are videoing because we don't know what's going on and Mom had never seen that before so we decided to go to MUSC to see what's happening because maybe they have better doctors I can't walk and the ER is probably on the third floor so this nice man carried me all the way to the ER and I think I was passing out but he was screaming move and stuff it was like in a movie scene and then he put me on the tray that they put people in the ER in and we spent some time in the ER because the doctors were asking all the basic questions um is she up to left is she epileptic does she have any issues with her heart is she healthy is she you know is her blood sugar right and mom was telling them we don't know what's going on we already had a EEG but it shows nothing but this is still happening what do we do the doctor had to um an IV we were having troubles with the IV come in my vein because it was to uh well it wasn't working and we had to spend time on that to get the IV and draw blood and stuff and Mom had to try to do it so that was that because mom had to try to do it I was like oh no you know because mom's a nurse and when the nurse tries to take over from another nurse it's not good so we stayed there and we did another e k e g I think and this one seemed to be better because the one the guy who did it on my head said that if they didn't remove my hair um like he had they did it wrong and we're like oh okay that's great because they most definitely did it wrong because they just put it on top of my braids while he sectioned out my hair and put it on my scalp once again it showed no sign even though Mom and Dad sitting on the sitting on the side in the room and me on the bed they could see me Twitch just twitch and still sleep and that's what's been that what had happened so because of this I'm on Homebound and I can't go to school because I can't walk while I'm eating I'm passing out and people are my my family's jumping out at the table making sure I don't choke while I pass out with food on my mouth I'm drinking through a straw my brother is carrying me upstairs I can't use the bathroom by myself I can't shower by myself I was completely helpless and we're coming back from MUSC Paul takes me up the stairs and I'm in my bed and I'm thinking how in the world can this happen I was just walking how long in DC enjoying the sights in the heat with all my strength intact we went to an orchestra we walked downstairs I didn't have any of this trouble so Mom and Dad going downstairs because during this time Dad's in Florida well no Dad's here but he's working in Florida I think they're talking about that or whatever and I lay in bed and I'm looking at the TV in front of my room nothing is in my mind right now and I hear Grace you can walk and when I hear that I get up I have all strength in my legs and I walked I don't remember I I know I walked but I don't remember walking and I get to the stairs and then I remember this I say Mom Dad I'm walking and my parents run up to me and I'm crying my dad's crying my mom's crying and we're just praying and thanking God at the end of the stairs and then I pass out again so me finally hearing God's voice I'm energized I'm like we are gonna get through this during uh that was during September in October mom had found a uh neural functional neurological a neurological chiropractor in Michigan and as we talked to him we heard that he had dealt with he had seen cases like mine people are fine and then they can't control their body at all so we talked to him and we pray about it and we decide to go to Michigan and we go to Michigan and we stay there for two weeks just doing normal um all he's doing is moving my head back and forth and as he and if I try to stand up I would pass out if um he tries to move my head a little bit too fast my heartbeat would shoot up for no reason so we just stay like there for a while and when I leave when I um walk I'm walking to the right but I can still walk straight but I just keep walking to the right my body is just pushing people so when we leave God help me help my body and him to correct it So the plan is when I came home from school when I come home from Michigan I'll go to school it took time God bless Lydia because she had to roll me in a high school with so many children who apparently don't see a wheelchair one time Lydia hit this girl's ankles because we had to turn and we're like sorry but we didn't really care but um I thank God for Lydia she pushed me up she took me back to the car when I wanted to go home and I thank God for Joy for just encouraging all of us during school you don't realize that people only ask when they see something's wrong they don't truly care you know and my church family thank God for them because they always came and prayed for me and they just made me feel real welcomed and loved and this went about during all December I was in a wheelchair and then I talked to Lee I was like Lydia I'm gonna walk when Christmas break is over and Lydia said bet let's do it so we would walk in our neighborhood with the wheelchair I would walk with the wheelchair in front of me and we'd go down the street when it was too much I'd get in the wheelchair and Lydia would roll me back up we did that all during Christmas break and um sooner or later I wouldn't have the wheelchair in my hand or with me at all so Mom was like okay put the backpacks on your back because that's extra weight so we would do that we would even add more weight to make sure so even during all of this during church I would be experiencing symptoms that I've never seen my arm would flop like it was a fish out of water by itself it would just do that one time my arm should shot out and I hit my grandmother I didn't even mean to that just happened it I just did that and my leg would kick like it was a machine out of function my eyes I couldn't open my eyes by myself I would have to wait I couldn't tell them to do it apparently I had to wait on them so I had to battle with my body for some time and I thank God for healing me because um I'm standing and walking and [Music] just yesterday I was helping carry things and you know I'm taking my time because you know I'm still recovering but God is so real [Applause] I have a picture of when me and Lydia went back to school after Christmas break and it's a picture of me and Lydia walking in school without the wheelchair and we titled the picture Victory Day because [Applause] so um I just thank God for giving me the opportunity to tell my testimony [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey man how many thank God for that make mine short and sweet a couple years ago since we've given testimonies about how God healed your body and if you heard the word last night and you received your healing just thank God for it a couple years ago um this was right before covet hit um I would have these spells in my throat where I would have a sore throat for months at a time and it's not on and off but a consistent sore throat for three four months at a time and never knew what was wrong it would go away for three days and then it'll come back and then I have it for six more months or however long and uh so I just finally was decided to go to a doctor because it just was getting unbearable and um I went to the doctor and he said well you know you never got your tonsils removed and your tonsils are very swollen and I knew I had a problem with my tonsils when I was actually in a freshman in high school my tonsil swole up to the size of a a orange and I just sat there on my neck and um but Pastor Simmons prayed for me and the Lord healed me without any surgery and all that and so it was just like brother Randy said last night the devil will come back and he'll make you believe that whatever you received you didn't receive and it don't always happen right away sometimes it may be years down the road that Satan will come and say well you know you never got healed from that thing and so I went to the doctor and he told me that you know we got to remove your tonsils and we have to remove your adenoids well like a lot of saints that go to this church my mom is a nurse and so she's like well I don't think that's a good idea you're too old for that and I said well Ma I really it's just unbearable I can't do it and young people I want to tell you if your parents tell you something listen to oh listen to him because my mom told me over and over don't get that surgery don't get that surgery and me being thinking I'm grown and I'm persistent and I'm saying I'm gonna do it anyway I'm gonna do it because I'm just tired of it I'm tired of it so I went and had the surgery which was successful but after I get out of surgery I just begin to have seizure-like symptoms and then I just die in many medical professionals in here the brain can't go without oxygen for eight minutes I was dead for about 10 to 15 minutes they were taking trying to revive me and revive me and whenever they would take me back to the operating room out there would bring me back then I would go out again and they would bring me back and I'll go out again so they put me on a ventilator for three days I went into surgery on a Tuesday I didn't wake up until Friday afternoon and didn't know what was happening what transpired to nothing like that and I just went into a deep dark depression I was living with my I went and lived with my mom to recover and I just like I just want to go home I just want to go home I want to go home and again my mom said I don't think you need to go home I don't think you need to go home and I just decided to pack my stuff up and when I leave and I go home anyway and that night I just don't know what came over me but I was so depressed I was so upset because you know when you're going through problems as a young person especially it ain't just one problem that you're going through it's one two five seven I have that many problems it ain't just one and so I was just going through in my mind and I just bought a gun to to have you know protect myself and I said you know what I'm just tired of it I said I'll just become a burden of people I don't want to do it no more and I literally put my gun right here and I was about to pull the trigger and my phone went off and I knew my phone was on silent I knew I put it on silent because I knew somebody was going to call me my phone dinged and then it dinged again and it dinged again and it was a message that I you know I know we ain't supposed to have favorite preachers but I do so y'all forgive me if y'all don't one of my favorite preachers was preaching a sermon and he was preaching on having a purpose and the devil destroying it destroying your life to keep you from fulfilling that purpose and I was like I don't have no purpose you know within myself and so I was getting ready to pull the trigger and that went off and so I watched the full sermon then I began to pray and the Lord took it off of me well years down maybe a year down the road I just went to the doctor to get a physical and uh some other things done and the doctor told me he said you know son I don't know how to tell you this he said but you gotta you got a disease that you're gonna have to live with for the rest of your life and he said well you may not have children he said but you'll live a comfortable life and you'll be all right and so I went on and I believed that I believed it and that night I went to work in a brother uh clip came across my Facebook page and the brother said sometimes God puts a incurable disease on you just so he can make a miracle out of you and so from that point on I began to confess my healing like Lord you healed me Lord you said by your stripes I was healed it's already done and when I did that I just began to just keep confessing and keep festing it and it didn't happen right away I moved to uh Gastonia North Carolina and I had to get a physical done for work again and I was just dealing with some things in my body and I went to the doctor and she examined me she did and then she tested me for what I knew I already what they told me I had and so you know I was expecting to hear it but when I got my results back it was gone it was gone she called me and she said Son you got a clean bill of health and I knew and right then the Lord brought back to my remembrance I said Lord I told the Lord I promised Lord if you heal me from this I said I was serve you and I never looked back and God came back on that promise and not only did he do that but we were me and my wife we were trying to have a daughter God had promised us a daughter and we were trying to have it in in we couldn't we no matter how hard we tried we were trying we would have a negative test after negative test and miscarriages and all these things and nothing worked and so my I went to go preach a sermon down in Arkansas and this is what I believe true Ministry is when you can preach unbiasedly knowing that you're going through something where you can pour your heart out to people and know that you suffer within yourself and you don't try to cast your burdens on the people I'm preaching about speaking things into existence but I'm not speaking over my own life and sometimes that happens you speak things over other people and you serve in other people and then you lacking within your life because you don't apply the same Faith to your life and so I began to my wife thank God for her she said you know you preaching to all these other people preach to me you know how about we how about we put this stuff in action in our family you know and so after I finished preaching I didn't know the lord gave my wife three dreams you know God is perfected in threes he gave us three dreams that we were gonna have a baby and we got back and she said honey I think you need to go get a pregnancy test and I said okay you know and me being a husband and I love my wife and I don't want her to suffer because I know what she's been going through I told her I texted back I said honey I said I'll do it I said but you know if it's a bad result I want you to you know still be strong and still have faith and I don't know what changed within my wife but she said something that I think we should all tell ourselves she said honey don't worry she said I'm delayed but I'm not denied [Applause] and I know that's something we can all take for ourselves sometimes it the Bible says though it Tara wait on it you know and so she said baby I'm delayed but not denied so I'm not worried about it and so we took a test and normally it take you know three to three to five minutes for it to show up positive or something like that well we took a to decide to go a different route we took a you know regular old-fashioned test and within two seconds it was positive so of course we want to be sure and sure so we say you know what we're going to take the test that's been giving us giving us the fault the the results of negative we're going to take that test in the morning we took that test and it was positive and now we got our little baby girl sitting back there just like what she said [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord Saints listen to be in the house of the Lord amen amen oh my name is Damien Rogers I'm from Mullins South Carolina I got my wife over here with Christian Rogers 11 years take the law off of My Wife and my two sons brother Simmons encouraging me to start telling my testimony because I had stopped because uh you know it has been some years and you know I started Living Large save me and delivered me from so much I tried to like not talk about it but the Bible tells us we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony but uh me and Ernest grew up in Mullins brother in this right here on small mothers who are forsake the day of the Small Things amen Mayors grew up in Mullins I grew up a straight A

in church we went to a Baptist Church and whatever Grandma wanted me to do I did you know I tried to keep my Grandma happy because I knew if it went for her I would have been in the system you know I didn't really I felt love but I didn't understand like you know seeing the people with mom and dads always wanted a family you know what I'm saying um but as I kept growing old I of course I made Straight A's in school Ernst to tell you that I was naturally smart that's god-given a blessing but I ain't really made the best decisions um I started hanking around but I didn't have a father figure
