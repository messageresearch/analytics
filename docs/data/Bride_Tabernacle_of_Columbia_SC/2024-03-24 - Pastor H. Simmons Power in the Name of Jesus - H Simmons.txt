Jesus Amen sometimes it's it's not the Deep things it's the simple things God hides himself in Simplicity and re reveals himself in the same so sometimes we can get too deep and forget about the thing that really matters he says how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and heeding all that were oppressed of devils for God God was with him and we Are Witnesses of all these things which he did both in the land of Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and hang on a tree him God raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto Witnesses chosen before God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead and to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believe in him shall receive remission of sin may God bless you re words you may be seated he says in the 43rd verse andto him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believe in him shall receive remission of sin the power that's in the name of Jesus Jesus he went on to say in the 44th verse and while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believe were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was ped out the gift of the Holy Ghost for they heard heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then answered Peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of who the Lord I know Saul on his way to damasc said who are thy Lord the Lord said I'm Jesus Jesus amen then pray they him to T certain days the power in the name of Jesus Proverbs says in Proverbs 1810 the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run there in and they are safe so we realize the name of the Lord is a strong tower now as we go back to the book of Acts here we were talking talking about the book of Acts church but because of the name of Jesus he told us why Amen in Acts 3 it says the account of Peter and John going into the temple and they saw a man laying and they said unto him when he asking arms of them and they told them sing gold have we none but such as we have we give unto thee and they told him that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I want you to sixth verse he said rise up and walk see they use the name and in the 11th verse here in the same chapter it says here and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon greatly wondering people were excited they seen something happen and we're saying that we want to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever there's power in the name of Jesus the people ran together because they saw the man walking and when Peter the 12th verse and Peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of Israel why Marvel at ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our our own what our own power of Holiness we had made this man to walk and God the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of our fathers which glorified his son Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of P when he had when he was determined to let him go but ye deny the Holy One and Je the just and desired a murder to be granted unto you and you killed the what you killed who the Prince of Life whom God raised from the dead well we Are Witnesses and here what and his name through faith in what faith in his name you see it's something about the name the name of Jesus is so sweet the name power in his name wondering working power in the name hallelujah it's power in the name of Jesus Jesus when you don't know what to say or what to do you can call him by his name call

says if there be therefore any consolation in Christ of any comfort of Love of any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows in Mercy F fulfill ye my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being a one Accord is he talking to us being a one Accord amen of one mind let nothing be done through Strife of vain Glory but in less of M Let each exting others better than themselves look not every man on his own thing but every man also on the things of others let what what kind of mind did he have let this mind be in you which is also in who amen you want that's the kind of mind you want we didn't always have that kind of mind but we got a mind you know I I heard this song I got a mind to do right every day since Jesus gave me this mind to do right Amen Let the mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus amen they said who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be what to be equal with God but made of himself a no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of a men and being found in the fashion of a man he what I'm say you got you know just humble yourself say Lord I'm in your hand Lord Lord I'm in your hand humble yourself praise God you know I look at folks all the time they they they they said they saved they say they got the Holy Ghost and they'll fight you in a minute may even shoot you you know what I'm saying because they not they and they don't know just as much of their fight somebody can beat them and just as much as they can shoot somebody can shoot them that's a goodness our defense is God we got to depend on God hum on yourself hum on yourself realizing that amen it's not you that you that's so strong it's not the the gun that you got makes you so so mighty it's not the strength that you got or your intelligence your mind it's all you got is what God gave you and just as much as you got it God gave it to you amen God can take it away in the moment your health your strength your life amen God gave and the Lord can take it away so you you need to just be humble and stop come on I see Christian going on I said Lord have mercy y'all I better watch out there somebody bigger and bad than you I mean stop and thing amen the only way you liveing today is because of God's mercy only way you surviving is the mercy of God so what you boasting and bragging about oh nobody uhuh who are you what have you done so much that you deserve to be so boastful and so lifted up and pride about who are you I mean we got to realize we ain't nothing but God is everything and because of him amen We Are Who We Are it's because of God that we are who we are not because of who we are it because who he is and what he means to each and every one of us Jesus himself being in the form of God not thought it not being thought it not Rob to be equal with God are you with me but he humbled himself what the Christian what what why people can't get healed why people people can't be delivered cuz they failed to Humble themselves they failed to Humble themselves they would not humble themselves and you can pray for them all day and all night they'll still do the same sinful stuff that they done the only reason they doing that stuff is because they would not humble themselves watch what comes out of their mouth it's a lack of humility they're still worrying about who did this or who did that to them you know I I see a lot of people been hurt in a lot of ways and every time I look around I'm running into somebody who's got a lot of hurt and a lot of pain some folks have been messed up since childhood they went through things that they had no no power no strength over it and then they so they they feel so victimized until they do anything because they can't stand to live with what have happened to them in their life those are the people that gives up give up hope give up life and they become a victim and they wonder why God has left them and why God has allowed them to go through the things the hurt and the pain and the suffering that they've been through and then wonder where where was God then and why didn't God do something about my situation and my case and they come to church and sometimes in the church they get hurt sometimes they go through pain they go through things some sometimes the preacher is a hypocrite sometime the Deacon is a hypocrit sometime amen folks in the church are hypocritical sometimes things are all twisted up people all twisted up in their head and in their mind because they're hurting in the inside somebody asked me can you help the hurt that's said too many hurting people out here I can't help them all sometimes it's too many po people you can't have them on are you with me we come to places in our in life where people fail to go to the source go to Jesus Christ because he's the only one that can help us but instead of going to Jesus Christ they do anything because they said if Jesus was real why did he let it happen why did he let it happen happened to me if he was real why did he let it happen to me but Jesus is standing there with his arm outstretched said I'm here to help you somebody said why I said God didn't do it the devil did it whatever you were went through the devil did it why God let the devil did it you know sometime we say why you let you yourself become a victim why don't you get up why don't you take the situation to make a better life instead of letting it beat you die want you let it lift you up see some situation you take and use it for a stepping stone I can do better I'm not gonna do this because I've seen what it done to others some things I didn't want to do because I seen what it done to my family members I ain't going to do it but do you know I wasn't strong enough not to do it see it don't it doesn't matter what you say you ain't going to do you ain't strong enough not to do it that's why you need God without God you'll do anything Lord I'm depending on you to see me through cuz you know I if if God didn't come by and save me I don't know where I would have been or what I would have done but God saved me in time amen and I thank God because I probably would have been dead and gone somebody think we privileged it's just the mercy of God it's just God's mercy on us that's all it is it's not that you were better it's not that you I wouldn't do that no you would have done it yes you would might have done worse but God just had mercy on you and I thank God for his Mercy do you look down on others because others no thank God for the mercy of God I'm telling tell them why don't you turn your life to Jesus why don't you turn Let Jesus handle your situation he did it for me amen no good person like me God saved me are you with me well no good you don't what to save me he saved me from all the mess and all the lies and all those all the stuff that I I I was doing are you with me and God saved me one day and somebody say you think you're better I don't think I'm better I think God for his Mercy amen as a Christian I thank God for saving me somebody say I remember when you can remember when but I remember when he Saed me amen I remember when God delivered me praise God I didn't look back I thank God that didn't look back because I it means it means something to be saved I said it means something to know that you save that God is Sav you one day God delivered me one day not saying I'm better but thank God that God is better amen hallelujah I hope you realize he saved he's still saves nobody's better than the other one just thank God for salvation the Savor are you with me and some people have excuses for still being The Sinner when God doesn't paid the price oh well you just stronger than me then that's a lie ain't nobody stronger than you you just have to have faith and trust God no I you just strong no just have faith and trust God and if if if I stop trusting God today I'll be in bad shape amen I'm dependent on him every day are you with me but see those that won't call on the name of Jesus until God delivered them I'm telling you I spend my time before I spent all my medicine and all my money Amen to the doctor I Call On Jesus to something happen are you with me some sometimes you have to have enough Fai you to keep calling it amen and let something happen amen nothing wrong with the medicine now I ain't telling you that now but I'm saying some some cases Jesus got to take care some why don't you try him first try Jesus first let him have it you know sometime we we do everything before we Let Jesus handle and sometimes that when we come to the end that then we try Jesus I'm telling you we let ought to let Jesus hand on our situations now he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the Cross where wherefore God has also ninth verse highly exalted him and giving him a name which is what Hallelujah we can set back and be in part if we want to be oh Superstar bright star got a austar I got this I got that that don't mean nothing don't mean a thing in the kingdom of God oh I got certain status that don't mean a thing in the kingdom of God see just how humble you can be amen just how how much are you yourself you can get out the way all our accolades and all thank God Amen that you're able to certain things in this world that's good but that's not what what it's all about he is the Prince of Life praise God if you want to live you got to have Jesus to live other than that you Di and trespass in sin without Jesus life is not worth living amen it's because of him I live God has I exalted him you must exalt Jesus Christ I'm telling you brother and sisters failure to exalt Jesus Christ in your life in your everyday walk amen you failure to exalt Jesus God exalted him and you must exalt Jesus Christ you must let him be the head of your life you must ask him for direction and guidance every day amen you must say Lord amen what is your will for me today Lord guide me through this day God watch over me today God keep me today God I need you every day in the name of Jesus God take control of my life in Jesus name I don't care what addiction you might have amen I want to be addicted to the name of Jesus I want to say Jesus help me Jesus hey God help me Jesus oh God sometimes you have to cry with everything to send you God I need help in the name of Jesus Lord help me in the name of Jesus help me you know why people ain't delivered why people ain't set free why is the hurt of my daughters and while are they not heal is there no bomb in Gill is there no physician here I want to know if there no God here why then praise God in Jeremiah he says they kept on doing Wicked and doing Wicked and then they ask where why then in the health of my do daughters of my people why aren't they heal he said they doing more wickedness the Great images is the thing that they was worshiping and they Wonder where's my healing and God says you know they're not healed because they won't do right they won't live right they won't do right why why am I going through I need to do right I need to live right I need to I need to do what God says a Christian ought to do then healing is the
