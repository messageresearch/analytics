we thank the Lord for everyone fresh away out tonight we wasn't listening tonight we want to just continue on in the message from Sunday morning by the grace of God and we were talking about the destiny of the soul just where our souls gonna be and how we stand with God it's gonna determine how how we identify with the word so tonight as we bow our heads we do want to say thank you again for tuning in and thank you for coming this morning father in Jesus name God you're great and greatly to be praised and we want to thank you today thank you for your blood that you shed it thank you for those old God that are praying warriors Lord and we thank you Lord God for Lord without you we can do nothing with you Lord all things are possible to them they believe and father we put our trust in you I should have look upon the sick in the trouble Lord the nation the world is in a turbo condition Lord Lord men and women don't know what to do what seemeth oh god they're taking the ease in Zion but father we know that the rapture is at hand and the coming of the Lord is close so father we want to prepare our hearts to go back with you Lord let everyone know God the name the name of Christ you said depart from iniquity so Lord as we look to the hills now trusting in your failing word of promise you know all the special requests you know all the needs lord action to look upon them Lord brother Barnes your brother Lord for you touch him today Lord the different Warren's an excellent prayer Lord you know that all them by their names in Jesus name we pray amen the father's have eaten sour grapes and the children teeth assetid edge as I live say the Lord you shall not have occasion anymore to use this proverb in Israel behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father saw so the soul of the son is mine and the soul that's in it it should die the destiny of the soul just where where is the soul headed now we understand that we took God's servant said the soul is the nature of the Spirit the book of Hebrews for we want to look at it from the standpoint what the word says here it says in the twelfth verse Hebrews four and twelve for the word of God it's quick it's powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even the divine of the Sunda of the soul and of the spirit and of the joints in the marrow and is a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart so the Word of God can reach down into the depths of man in and actually the soul of man so he said to sold that sentence has a destiny in the destiny of that soul that sentence is death and the Bible tells us that the wages of sin is death in the gift of God is eternal life we told on Sunday that God made man spirit man and Genesis 1 and then he next he made God a man of the dust of the ground breathed in his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul the difference between man and animal animal has a spirit and it has flesh but it doesn't have a soul but man has a soul and that soul that sentence that should die so we're responsible for the destiny of our soul then God plays us on free more agent you have a choice to make in the decision to me God told Adam and Eve every tree of the garden you may freely eat but of the tree of knowledge and good and evil the day you eat thereof that's the day you die and sometimes we talked about death we talked about death it's being separated from God we find that God put man out of a Garden of Eden and he put Charles down range instead of God the way to the Tree of Life that man couldn't get back into God he said Lisa eat up the tree of life and live forever now Jesus being the tree of life we eat and we live forever are you with me so man that sin comes to death ends so the soul that sinneth shall die well what happened to the soul that event that God David said thou restored my soul God comes to bring man back to God now how did they do that when he was telling the disciples after his resurrection that what to do in commission in them he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost is the very nature of God it's a very life of God it's gooey God's on life so the Holy Ghost comes amen inside of you he meant to bring man back in relationship and bring back the very nature of God back to man because man nature had become corrupt are you with me so man in the sense had become corrupt sinful amen and from underneath and from sin amen came death by sin amen so by the grace of God I want to send all of that I want to go to some places here and in the book of first Thessalonians 5:23 first Thessalonians 5:23 it says here we talk about the gates of the inlets to the body the five senses taste here see and so forth and the five inlets of the five contacts to the body until the spirit of vice versa some said of soul some set of spirit and when we talk about reason affecting confidence and memory and so forth now when we talk about those things that deal with our spirit without soul then it's so that's one of the other faiths our unbelief when man went away from God that means he died when Eve doubted the word then men become deaf came in and they were separated from God because man had sinned and in the president of God man could not stay in the president of God because of sin because God is a holy God and God being holy man cannot stay and abide in the presence of God are you with me so man cannot stand the president of God because of sin that how can we we could come to church we can go through the motion he meant but of our soul is not right with God if in the inside we don't have faith in God and we have faith in God then he said man should not live by bread only alone but he should live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so we're responsible before God to live by every word not just part of it every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so God has acts and you and I they meant to recognize he meant because Eve dotted one word and it caused all his sickness all the pain all the death everything they meant that we can imagine all our troubles all our sorrows is because Eve God at one word and the devil was able to come in amen Lucifer when he was in heaven he just the Bible says yeah the Lord has made all things even the wicked for the day of evil if God made all things amen but you say that God make the evil he said he made all things even the wicked because but we want to look at it from the standpoint that God made Lucifer and he made everything good God is the great fountain of love and it was not no evil in God but the Bible says when Lucifer exalted himself and the Bible text about the devil when he speaks to life speaketh of his own for he is the father of it God is not the author of confusion God did not bring make us sin I'll make man sinned or make the Lucifer do what he did Lucifer in his own self he had a decision to make that he wanted to take over his pride he got lifted up are you with me so God did not make him evil he became evil because of his own imaginations and the thoughts of his heart became wicked and that's what happens man thoughts and when God made man he made man wholly made Eve and Adam holy but he didn't make him a robot where he program and say do this he made him a mint were they free are you with me and because we get the Holy Ghost that don't mean we become we will slaves prisoners by our own free will we are Paul says I am a prisoner for the Lord and because I'm a prisoner amen it's because I I want to live this way I recognize this is what I chose this is what I want and I'm happy being this way amen because before Amen I was a slave to sin amen I was a slave to unrighteousness but now Amen I am to God amen I'm a prisoner to God and I love being a prisoner for God because I know amen well my destiny where I'm headed because I know where I was headed I was headed to death and I was headed to hell oh you wouldn't but now I have a new destiny a new destination a mint in things that ought to be a mint God serve it talked about it was talking about you and I became when God lit the fire when the Holy Ghost came in got a little fire and we became sons and daughters of God and then he says Amen talked about you and I being jeans and of God in attributes of God where God for Dane nothing before the foundation of the world are you with me so God saw that one day that you would make the decision he meant that you wanted that baptism of the Holy Ghost and when God fill you with the Holy Ghost he meant you lit a fire that you a meant became sons and daughters of God and you reckon I do your father was God and he is the worry are you with me but you amen you had a decision to making you made the right decision are you a man but then others have a decision to make but they make the wrong decision with you and I because your destiny your soul meant something it was valuable to you where you go to spend eternity was valuable it was important he meant some people it's not important they don't care if they come to church they don't care if they all serve the Lord they I'm telling you some people view of God is so I don't know it's so it's so chaotic it's so like a puzzle you know they have no concept of what God is requiring what God wants amen God amen wants you to realize the value of your soul amen and God has made provision a meant to take you where you need to be to get back amen from where a man has are you with me I want to get you back amen - what evil loss and what atom loss I want to take you back and I want to restore paradise again I want to restore you back to eating I wanted to restore you back amen to where you was before death came before sin came in are you with me so that's you on a journey brother and sister first Thessalonians 5:23 he said in 21 he says prove all things hold fast to that which is good a stain from all appearance of evil he's saying and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly oh you the very God of peace sanctify you wholly you know and that's what I believe that God it says you know a lot of pastors and I need to kind of bring that up - he said forsake not the assembling yourself together the amount of some is amen and then we ought to come together even the more sin that what we at the time we're living in now with this virus and all of this is going on but if we can find a way it ought to be able discern our heart with all our hearts we ought to desire to come together because that's what a man is all about when two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst we are with all our heart desire to come together and as much as we can and we can get just six feet apart we ought to just do that and just do it with all our heart Lord I want to come if I have to where I'm a survivor to do this lord I want to come together because I want to fulfill your word are you with me so it ought to be in our heart to do what we can to come together are you with me so your soul it determines your action determines what your soul don't spend eternity well your destinies are you with me so he says and the 23rd verse for the very God of peace if I you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be what we preserved blameless God wants your soul to be blameless he wants you to be blameless a church without spot or blemish any such thing that it might be holy amen God wants you to be holy God want you to be blameless and I God has if he's required that that he must make provision for that to be because of God did not provide a way for you to be blameless then you would have an excuse but God said I pray God that your whole body soul and spirit amen be preserved blameless God wants to preserve you blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ he said faithful is he that called you who also what will also will do it God it's gonna do it for you amen he said he will do it now you just have to allow him to do it for you amen he said he will do it amen so brother brother and sister I want to go a little further to extend this out amen we talked about amen the soul amen the senate's it's going to die and and in Hebrews it was it was telling us that the Destiny Hebrews 9 and 27 Hebrews 9 and 27 I just want to teach a little bit by the grace of God if I can I know I'm not a teacher like that but by the grace of God we 1 9 and 27 and God is so good to us it's so easy for me to speed up and get the preaching so I want to kind of slow it down because I want you to think he meant that as much as death is real a meant life is even more real I'm not talking about this life here because this life is only it's not the real thing is just a fragment it's just a little taste of what life is but Zoe is God's own life its eternal life amen and we want to a met have Zoe we want to have God like the the kind of life that they had before the fall they met and God breathed in the knowledge they received the Holy Ghost I want you to have that life I want you to taste of the heavenly gift I want you to be partakers of the heavenly calling and that's what I said in Hebrews ro3 it says wherefore holy brethren amen God won't you he called your brother and partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus amen I want you to consider that you're partakers of a heavenly calling amen and God called you to be heavenly not earthly bound by heavenly bound God is taking you to a higher level amen he's taking you Amy and not like a beasts and animals but God and not even like a human being in it because when we talk about humanity we're not talking about divinity amen and when we talk about divinity we're talking about God nature Amite divine nature but when we talk about humanity we're talking about human nature amen and the difference between human nature in God's in nature Amen because God's nature is holy it's alright he meant to have morals and all of that but when we got to divine nature that's something that only comes from the baptism of the Holy Ghost come from the audience self are you with me so it's a difference brother he meant to be morally good and humanely good and nice and do the humanly things because amen we will not say by works what we're saved by grace amen but it's but we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works so it is he that worketh in us both the will and to do of his good pleasure so it's not us anymore living but it's Christ that lives inside of us are you with me so the question lives inside of you it is the Christ that gives you a meant that kind of life that I'm talking about that kind of nature that was lost in the garden amen it's being restored back to the party so here we are brothers sister on a journey the destiny of the soul the value of your soul what more than ten thousand worlds Amen brothers sister God is calling you to a higher calling your soul is important and God wants you to recognize even don't take in life even but we take it light because we don't understand amen so we understand about church we understand about coming to church hearing the word singing and just talking all kind of nonsense thinking all kind of nonsense in our head who did this who said that all kind of stuff like that but when it comes down to our soul none of that is important amen we must focus our attention on amen amen well I gotta be concerned about the destiny of my soul where am I headed all of this is just bumps in the road and I'm not gonna let these bumps stop me amen amen stuff amen the devil try to put it in my way to keep me from my destiny because I'm headed somewhere amen all of this is just a light affliction is it is that possible amen we got to go do some things because we go to things we got to be careful how we conduct ourselves when we go into our tests are you but you wanna journey and you've been tested and you've been tried I mean your action sometimes you can justify your action but God will never justify you in it because you got to take it and you gotta say god I love you in spite of me I'm not gonna be faithful to Brian Tabernacle feat little brother Simmons I'm gonna be faithful to God are you with me so the God that you serving amen you don't owe me anything but you all God everything how much do I owe him I told him everything well we got me without God we're nothing Hebrews for as it is appointed to men once to die amen I said on Sunday we have an appointment each and every one of us have God Terry amen you have an appointment but we're not looking to die he meant with we've already died in Christ but in reality it's just like Jesus was trying to talk to disciples and said my friend your friend louder is asleep and I'm going to wake him in and they said Lord of his sleep he do it well and Jesus said I want you to know he's dead so if I talk to you is the point of the man wants to die and after the judgment you don't want me to use the word Amen it's appointed to die because you're looking forward to the rapture isn't that right but in reality a meant some that here today may not amen make the rapture you might die before the rapture are you with me I might die before the rapture we don't know Amen but we just believe in that God is going to come and take us in the rapture before death comes amen somebody please God so just look at a mint but we know death is real and death is a reality Amit is not something that we just imagine in our mind and it can it can just disappear it it won't come our way we know it's it's coming everybody wait we can feel it as you amen you go from Amit the adolescence and you start are going to adulthood in and when your door for a little while you find out did you come from somewhere they meant you come from baby and you come through your adolescence and you come into adulthood and you pass it on to middle age and then you get like me and you're passing on in into old age oh you look me well you had it I'm going somewhere I'm going he said the star and dust out your return in that right but it said it speaks that of the body but not of his soul oh you with me Amen he said we bought nothing in the world and it said we can take nothing out but God servants it is what you take out is your character it meant how you conducted your life I try I try to stress to my children amen if you stay in the bear too long if you make certain habits you're building a character if you let the lawn clock ring two or three times amen and you know and you might be late for work and you don't want to live like that when the alarm clock rain one time jump up and get up and let's go let's fly they met because the lawn clock Ingo means nothing after a while get a ring and ring and you'll sleep are you a man so what you practice you building a character after why you mold yourself into an image and that's what you will be are you with me if you got a lid on and I mean but if you get up and you get your move around amen you become active and you come motivated you got to get serious about the things in this world if you're gonna aim it be those that's gonna achieve certain goals and have certain things in life you got to get up and move you can't just set around and things come to you I want you to be able to be successful in this world here big but you got to move you got to go and get it somebody say you got to give you a go-getter you got it going moving you got to go in at Ain a men you can scarcely back and serve the will of God if don't save your natural will type out your spiritual naturally you have no vision without without a vision the people perish we must have a vision they make our destiny work and we must be concerned if we're not concerned about our soul how can the preacher be concerned about it amen how can you know the church how can we brothers and sisters you got to work out your own soul salvation with fear and trembling you got to realize that I my soul is headed somewhere and is headed to glory and I got to make sure I got to prepare myself for where I'm going as much as God said when I am there you may be also and I'm going to prepare pleased for you oh you with me and I want to be ready for that please see men for the bride has made herself his wife had made us somewhat ready you got to make yourself ready for the police hit God prepare for you amen I heard God say if the ground Amen is not prepared you go throw the seat on it something the birds and but you've got to prepare to ground are you with me so when the seed of the word fall into the ground it could come forth and bring forth fruit in the right so let's prepare our hearts else the soul a man is sitting now what is it I believe amen I want you to know and then you amen have you just take this journey is so light I mean you don't value you might value if I just ten million dollars I'll be rich I'll be a value that a man you don't value fifty cents if you don't value a hundred dollars how you gonna value Oh ten million dollars you'll be just as broke as you are now you wouldn't have nothing just like you don't have nothing why because you don't take advantage of what you've got if you're a faithful over little how can God trust you with a life are you with me so you've got to take amen these carnal things that God has given to you and you got to use some amen that is my given increasing that's what we complain about that but this it's almost like the man said I ain't got for one dollar I might as well bury it a lot of people don't value their soul they bury me they just throw it away in my soul and my soul don't mean that much to me I've just taken a throw it away and that's what it is people can do all kind of stuff in the pleasure of this world men will be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God that's what the last days condition is we'll go out we'll do everything when it comes down to God we don't do nothing outstanding for God amen sometimes we ought to do something that are outstanding for God amen let's show God how much I love you we'll do some outstanding for ourselves we go they meant to hole or we go - oh Lord I bet that said some of these things y'all won't get mad at me but do things jump on a plane Kalamazoo and do all kind of things I'm in a cup of fuel three or four thousand dollars you know I had a good time but women last time your soul and your spirit man your inner man could rejoice it's and Lord God thank you oh god I'm so I mean I feasted on a man God has energized my feet oh god I'm all ready to be a witness I'm striving for reflection Oh God thank you when you've ever seen folks excited and fired up stir it up because God a demon has dropped something down in your spirit and you said Lord thank you brother so you got to desired you got to seek hey you got a seek maybe I might get off for this for a minute but Romans 2 I was reading that today we're almost to excuse me for a minute we're almost to maybe I just stored Romans two here and I just started father it says but after that the Hartness and infinite heart trade you up unto thyself rap against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God who renders to every man according to his deeds to death patient continues in well doing seek that's what I was this is diversity really struck me today to them who by patient continuance see in well doing seek for glory see you got a seek seek and you shall find seek for glory and honor and what see you got a seek for in mortality people want to live forever seek for immortality and that's what it means your soul amen it's in mortality Amen that God is providing for you but you got to seek for immortality he said seek for glory and honor and immortality and then he says eternal one eternal life but what happens but there's no seeking you know I you know I you know and in this covert time and the people you know not got around to alter not seeking and crying out to God you know I just you know I missed all time this amen coming out and crying out and seeking God on the altar crying out to God I seek I miss the way that people come together in a Norton and atmosphere is electrified and the people of lifting their hand and praising the Lord hallelujah the smiles on their faces Amen you missed out amen but I'm saying let's not let the devil take that away from us let's do what we can do we men let's say god I appreciate I will seek immortality it really struck my soul it stirred me up amen but he said here in a first but unto them that are contentious that are contentious and do not what and do not obey the truth o you of me but obey what unrighteousness in the nation and round he says you know you know sometimes contentious let's not be contentious amen but no this is their destiny tribulation anguish upon every one every why you see what I'm saying every soul of man amen every soul of man that was that doeth evil amen every soul a man that doeth evil of the Jew first and also to the Gentiles but glory honor and peace to every man that working what no one treats us do good amen because you have what God I mean that is the attribute of God even noting that the devil does to make God react or respond I mean they can spit on him naked whooping and naked 12 Legion away he's not gonna call 12-lead an angel I don't need a war I could've called 12 are you but because of his love evening and if that same Jesus dwelling on see me that same God that same word that same kind of life how do we respond in the time of our adversities when we'll try it and we will attest it how do we respond that's determines the destiny of your soul what you had it well your soul going brother and sister you've got to be concerned enough about your soul and the destiny of your soul that your soul is important is very valuable in it because God came down a menace on the condition that we were in and he said in I got to bring man bike he makes the wave hell from I see some sons and daughters that attracted at death and I got to make away a bridge to make them make a way for them to get back to God and I believe that God even through Jesus Christ he meant bridge the gap they men that separated you and I from God and it took the blood of Jesus Christ and the blood of Jesus Christ atoned for each and every one of us I know I couldn't get to my subject because I got the preaching you know I see the state slow down and just teach you know but I get it got excited did I go too fast okay but I'm dealing with your soul in there points because you know sometimes you can look on folks face and says it ain't get there it's not even penetrating because they don't see the importance of their soul it's not it's not in not surging deep it's not going down into the anchor the soul the soul got to be anchored what well how did this God anchor the soul amen his word goes down to the depth of your heart and it enriches you amen it makes your life richer it meant it makes your heart pure it actually sanctify you wholly it cleanses you amen it purges you've all unbelief and all doubt it makes you love amen in a deeper way your enemies it goes down in this surges so this is what I don't have time to get into this but I maybe I just I better cut off get the it's gonna take me too long just some things I want to get in but I love you today and I want you to love God if you love God you love me amen if you don't love God then ain't got no problem I still love you amen and that's what it's gonna take amen people want you to love them and they want to be loved but you got to love me even when you think I'm wrong amen because the devil would pay tricks with all of us and he'll play tricks with all of our minds are you with me and if we listen to him long enough to take the love of God away from us well we can't allow ourselves to be victims of the devil we're not ignorant of Satan advices so brother and sisters by all means by this meant you know that you're my disciples because you have love one for the other and then brother and sister we ought to be able to lay down our lives for one another oh you whoopee for God's God lay down his life for us Amen it's alright to lay down your life for your husband your wife for your children amen but for the least one brother and sister let us be ready at all times to give an answer concerning home that God has given us he's given you and I he turn our life God has given us a place that he prepared for us and that place he said that where I am there you may be also I hid my father's house and I'm gonna tell you something God has prepared a house for his children to do we all and there's so best house that we're living in it's not the house that God intended for us to have are you with me but God God got a house amen and as God's servant setting things to be they meant God has prepared a place for you and I a house not made with hand so look like get that message thing didn't ought to be and you see put a stir on your heart God loves you and we love you let us pray father
