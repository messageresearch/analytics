spirit can be clean lord ready to receive your word lord we thank you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen god is good tonight amen we want to look at the book of matthew by god's grace matthew 14. matthew 14 and and we'll begin at the 22nd verse you got it say amen and it reads and straight away jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him until the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into the mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight away jesus spoke unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou if it be thou be me to come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walketh into the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefores did thou doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased and they that were with that they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god and when they were going over it came into the land of jenesseret and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased and besought him that they might only touch the hymn of his garment as many as were touched were made perfectly whole may god are the blessed to the reading of his word tonight about god's grace we try not to hold you along just but i i entitled it the sermon tonight your darkest hour amen i entitled it your darkest hour you know i like here how jesus i mean how in the scriptures it says that you know it was the fourth watch of the night you know many talk about that fourth watch and when they talk about that fourth watch they say sometimes you know they look at it as the hours of three between three and six you know some very i can say very dark dark hours of the of the night so when we translate that you know spiritually speaking into our lives our lives some very dark times but we want to say in your darkest hour you know i says you know as i was on my knees the other day and i was thinking about ministering on a sermon uh titled it searching for answers because sometimes you don't know what to do the present crisis and stuff that's at hand you don't know how to handle so a lot of times you you you within yourself are searching for answers but we know that god has all the answers you know i was sharing with someone that says we aren't like those that don't have hope but we have hope we live because he lived that's the way we we saw of how he overcame and it says that you know not to fear the world christ told us that he says because i have overcome the world so when we look at the present crisis sometimes i like how the bible says david had to encourage himself because sometimes we got to encourage ourselves to know that in the midst of all of the things you know that we're faced with that we don't have to worry because he will overcome because he overcame all uh all our victory uh i say tonight belongs to christ the battle ain't chores but the battle is yours i mean the battle ain't choice but the battle is the lord's so when we fight him you know i was sharing with the church and something the other day i was saying you know that little song my wife was playing it the other morning fight on christian soldiers you fight on come on it says keep your sword in your hand and you fight on and i thought about that i said that was my motto here with this present crisis and the things that we see taking place to turmoil i said what are you gonna do i said we're gonna fight on you know a brother called me and he was telling me you know of his situations and the issues that he's faced with with his body and all those things and i asked him the question i say well what are you going to do are you going to give up come on i said no you fight on and i was thinking about i says you know i was sharing him how i was sharing with the guy at work he was saying that how his truck broke down and he was like man every time i try to get ahead something happened my car broke down and this and i thought about something the profit of god was talking about he says that you know we always are striving for perfection we always gonna be striving for more you know the thing is you know once you once you think you got a little bit of money it's bills to pay once you get the bills caught up then the car gonna break down then after the car break down you get that straightened out somebody gonna get sick come on it's gonna it's trial after trial test out the test but we got a blessing of surety that we know one thing that the bible declared that what you going through these are light afflictions these these are are nothing to be compared with the glory you know like the bible says he enduring the shame and the cross because he saw what was set before him i began to share i says what it is i says you got to fight on i asked the guy at work i said what you going to do you going to quit come on i said no but you got to fight on come on i said the things you're going through it ain't like nobody else ain't been through them before when we look in the scriptures we got so many clouds of witnesses the bible says that time would fail to tell all of their stories how many believe that tonight so they got stories to tell and when we get over there you can say that they'll tell their story how they made it over but i said i ain't gonna let them be the only one to testify come on but i'ma tell them how i made it over how did you make it over it was only by the grace of god because when i felt like hallelujah giving up come on in my darkest hour jesus showed up he showed up in some form some way hallelujah and that's what we're talking about in your darkest hours i was telling my uncle the other day i said you know it never failed when i'm faced with something or i really need it i'm searching for answers the word of god came i said and what it is when god answers you answer me i said it never felt they never felt that he did what would bring me back to the scriptures in the same scripture that you heard over and over when the lord brings it to you come on then it becomes alive and once it becomes alive it's got power in it hallelujah i like how jesus told peter and those when the bible says that they saw him coming they cried out for fear but one of the first things he says was to fear not hallelujah but be of good cheer i know the storm is raging i know the wind is contrary and the ship is being tossed but put a smile on your face keep joy in your heart hallelujah shout in the midst of the of what you're going through hallelujah like it says i was sharing with the church the other day i said you know i came to the place in my christian journey where i says lord i'm not asking for you to move the mountain i'm not asking for you to take away the storm but what i'm asking you for is the grace and the patience to make it through it i want to wait on you lord i don't want to move so fast god because why when i come out of it i'm going to be better than i was when i went in it hallelujah how many believe that tonight but we find that it's your darkest hour come on i said all the time you know just thinking about it i says we got so many clouds of witnesses when we look through the scriptures in the darkest times that's when god showed up he showed up in such a way and a lot of times it was supernatural happens you know a lot of times god if he wants to he can ease it anytime you want to he can ease a storm or the rain any time he won't but he allows things to happen because he's he's doing something in your life he's bringing out something in you you know when you look back over your life you ought to see yourself growing hallelujah you ought to see yours you ought to see growth in your christian journey the things that bother you you should like he says overcoming part of that overcoming ain't winning one battle and that's it but it's all the little battles that make up the war it's all the little fights and the little things that you that you come through hallelujah then in the end you can you can tell your story how many believe that tonight but i said it's your darkest hour i said as we we taught that by the scriptures that uh uh in the darkest times that's when jesus shows up in those times i don't know about you i was thinking about the things that we faced with and how you know we all in prayer and the sickness and the things at hand but then like i said i'm reminded lord this is the time where you show up this is your hour this is your season because it's out of our hands we can't do nothing about it we gonna need a supernatural guard to do supernatural things we're gonna need that guard that we've been singing about jehovah jairo come on he's my provider we're gonna need him to provide jehovah nisi jehovah shalom come on the prince of peace we need you to be those things and we gonna worship you because you are those things hallelujah how many believe that tonight so we find that i says lord in those hours i don't know about you people look all around don't they but i said i'm looking up scriptures start coming alive you know david said i'll look to the heels from where it's cometh my help come on i'm looking to calvary i'm looking to where he died hallelujah his blood was shed and he said that it's finished devil don't have no hold on you he can't do nothing to you why because god has stripped him i was ministering the other day i said he rose he said all power is given unto me hallelujah and he says all that god was reporting christ and all that was in christ he poured into the church you and i hallelujah the devil has been stripped of all his power he's trying to take control of your mind what i say is get your mind right let this mind be in you that was also in christ hallelujah that in the midst of what he going through he wasn't looking at his surroundings but he know where his help came from and i know tonight where my help come from it don't come from my natural body it don't come from my natural strength of finances but all of my help come from the lord if it ain't the lord that build a city it won't be built if god don't keep the house the house will be destroyed if god don't touch you in the morning you won't be able to get up out of the bed but it's goddamn hallelujah and it's god now how many believe that tonight hallelujah i said in your darkest hour i was praying i said lord this is your time hallelujah in the fourth watch of the night they crying for fear he said be a good cheer hallelujah oh peter see him walking out on the waters all walking out on the stormy seas and he said lord if it's you bidding me to come i want to walk on my troubles i want to walk in on the waters in the midnight i want to walk in that hallelujah sometimes the devil make you want to lay down and die make you want to give up hallelujah but i say don't give up go to jesus get out the boat and go to jesus welcome to mister what you're going through walk in your trials jesus is bidding you to come tonight get up from crying and get to walking hallelujah get up from complaining and whining and go to jesus hallelujah so i don't know about you but i'm going to jesus how you going to jesus i'm going down on my knees the bible said they cried out lord save me hallelujah that's what peter cried out hallelujah and the lord reached out his hands he won't let you fall hallelujah i thought about that song jesus said if you lean on me hallelujah i won't let you fall god ain't gonna let you fall tonight lean on it hallelujah oh jesus how many want to lean on the lord tonight i said in your darkest hour come on it's dark out there hallelujah the night is dark it's the fourth watcher tonight hallelujah they talk about between three and six but you know what happens after the fourth watch hallelujah the sun getting ready to come up hallelujah the sun is getting ready to rise blessings are on the way your healing is on the way your deliverance is on the way how many believe that tonight hallelujah oh jesus somebody give god praise i don't know about you but i said lord this is your this is your hour i said i'm transferring it over to jesus i'm giving it all to him i don't know about you like the saul said i surrender all i'm giving it all to him all of my hurt all of my pain all of my worries i'm giving it all to you lord i surrender all lord here it is god my job is to worship you my job is to give you thanks and to give you praise you gonna take care of everything else that's what i'm here to do god i'm giving it all to you hallelujah i ain't worried about it no more i'm giving it all to you oh i gave it over to jesus hallelujah and it's been all right how many believe that i say give it to jesus i challenge you to give it to jesus i don't care what it is you know he's the master of everything come on he's the master of every situation hallelujah he he's the master builder the master carpenter the master doctor he's a great physician he's all those things come on he's the expert he's higher than highest as they say he's greater than the greatest hallelujah he's all those things and if he is that's the god i serve hallelujah i like how those hebrew boys says that if he don't deliver us that don't take away from who he is he's still able and we still won't bow down hallelujah we're going to press our way through we're still going to fight on oh jesus come on ain't taken away from him he's all powerful how many believe that tonight i said in your darkest hours you know i was sharing with the church on sunday i said jesus you know the thing about he can show up whenever he wants to but he waits till the situation gets dark he waits all hope is gone come on abraham against hope believed in hope hallelujah he didn't even consider his body now dead hallelujah or the deadness of sarah's womb but he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but he was strong in faith giving glory to god hallelujah against all hope he believed in it how many believe that in his darkest hour he knew hallelujah that he that made the promise was able to keep it hallelujah i believe that the one that made the promise come on we standing on the promises of jesus god our savior we standing on it i say tonight god ain't forgot you come on god ain't forgot about you you can be down like the hebrew boys in babylon god ain't forgot about him daniel them said we still ain't gonna defile ourselves come on in the midst of our darkest hour god ain't forgot about us he's still revealing secrets to the hearts he's still doing supernatural things he's still sustaining us in our darkest hour hallelujah watch god show up i said you know he can come whenever he wants i thought about you know lazarus and how they called for him when lazarus was sick he could have came then couldn't he he could have came but he didn't he waited till it got dark didn't he he died and what he says ain't no houston call for him no more come on the situation is hopeless but i believe just says as in the scriptures you know god asked abraham he said is there anything too hard for the lord come on as long as god is alive and well hallelujah ain't no situation too hard for him come on he dead he's been stinking four days but there's nothing too hard for the lord i said is is god alive and if he's still alive your situation ain't hopeless your case ain't hopeless he's still able hallelujah to bring life to the bones how many believe that tonight hallelujah we talk about the dead in christ rising first how that's going to happen by the power of god i like that song everything is moving by the power of god hallelujah not by might nor by power as he says but by my spirit it's power in the spirit the brain the life hallelujah those that are going on how many believe that and i'm looking forward to it too be caught up hallelujah to meet him nothing else matters come on oh jesus i said he could have came whenever he wanted to but he waited till it got dark didn't he wait until he dead in the grave then he shows up i could see mary the bible says she didn't even go out to meet him but she stayed in the house cooking maybe she got in her feelings he didn't come when we needed him so it ain't doing no good to come now come on oh the situation is over with but martha the bible says when she heard that jesus was coming she ran out to beat him she said lord she says if you had been here our brother wouldn't die but even now hallelujah you showed up you still can raise them up right now i know you can't even right now that's the kind of faith we're looking for the doctors gave them up but even now hallelujah situation is hopeless but even now lord oh i'm running to see jesus i ain't getting in my feelings and saying lord you didn't come when we needed you to come lord i'm glad you're here and whatever you want to do god do it hallelujah i just want to be a part of it oh jesus don't you want to be a part of what god's doing hallelujah oh i said but what it is she came running out and jesus began to say he says she says she's talking about the resurrection he says i am the resurrection come on and the life he that were dead no he don't i mean he that lived and believed he said he that were dead no he was dead if he should believe in me shall live again amen help me out he says but though you know you know the scripture is the devil see what the devil does come on but the word of god is true hallelujah how many believe that tonight i said god could have came anytime he wanted but he waited to the darkest hour to show us come on to show us something that in the darkest hour we got so many clouds of winter in the darkest hour come on that's when here comes jesus showing up say lord where were you before he says i was about i was there all the time didn't i say i'll never leave you nor forsake you and i promise i will never fail you come on hallelujah don't matter how dark the situation is in the darkest hour here comes jesus coming all along hallelujah when everybody's in the frenzy here comes jesus the call of peace be a good cheer fear not come on be at peace be at rest i'm here now hallelujah and i'm gonna i'm gonna handle that situation in your darkest hour i'm gonna take care of it come on and i said that you know long as we live in this life we got we got challenges not get all over ourselves we got challenges you know we got things to face don't we come on mountains to climb all these things but in the darkest hours come on this is god's time this is his time where he shows up hallelujah so what are we doing we're going to go home as i was saying uh earlier fight on come on fight on christian soldiers hybrid song go fight on come on keep your sword in your hand and you fight on read your bible come on pray every day hallelujah fight on hallelujah keep your sword in your hand you know when you're looking up it's hard to see what's going on around you fires in the things earthquakes it's hard to even notice those things when you're looking up hallelujah because you only see your savior you only see calvary and what it done for you how it brought the victory how it brought you out of sin and shame hallelujah how it translated you when you were born again from the from the powers of darkness it translated you into the kingdom hallelujah his dear son when all things hallelujah are accessible to those that believe do you believe tonight i said your darkest hour come on i asked you the question tonight i said people tend to look everywhere but up come on i thought about saul he went to a witch come on people tend to look everywhere but uh are you gonna look up come on are you looking to jesus this is this is the fourth night let's call it like that it's dark who are you looking to as the night gets darker come on who are you crying out to hallelujah cry out to jesus hallelujah lord help us we need help god save us we need savior do something again lord this is your
