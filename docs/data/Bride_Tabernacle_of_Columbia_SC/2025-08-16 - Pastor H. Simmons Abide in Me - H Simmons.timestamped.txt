[38:12] I am the true vine. My father is the
[38:14] husband. Every branch in me that beareth
[38:17] not fruit, he taketh away. And every
[38:20] branch that bears fruit, he purges it,
[38:23] that it may bring forth more fruit.

[38:38] &gt;&gt; and I
[38:39] &gt;&gt; in you.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; As the branch cannot bear fruit of
[38:44] itself except it abide

[39:06] &gt;&gt; the same bringeth forth much fruit. For
[39:09] without me you can do
[39:12] &gt;&gt; nothing.
[39:13] If a man abide not in me, he's cast
[39:17] forth as a branch and is withered. And
[39:22] men gather them and they are cast them
[39:26] into
