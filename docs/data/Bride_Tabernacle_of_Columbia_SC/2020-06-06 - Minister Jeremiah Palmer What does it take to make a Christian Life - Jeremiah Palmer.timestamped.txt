[22:52] amen amen
[22:55] if you have your Bibles to turn with me
[22:58] to the book of his ego is ego of 36 I
[23:07] know someone what we touch based on this
[23:10] from a different angle just felt a layer
[23:17] of the Lord to maybe speak just a little
[23:23] bit on just thought that 0 36 24 to 29
[23:41] for I will take you from among the
[23:47] heathen and gather you out of all
[23:50] countries and will bring you into your
[23:55] own land then will I sprinkle clean
[23:59] water upon you notice clean water and ye
[24:04] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[24:07] and from all your idols will I cleanse
[24:11] you a new heart also will I give you and
[24:16] a new spirit will I put within you and I
[24:22] will take away the stony heart out of
[24:26] your flesh and I would give you a heart
[24:29] of flesh and I will put my spirit within
[24:32] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[24:36] and you shall keep my judgments
[24:40] and do them and you shall do well in the
[24:44] land that I give to your father's and
[24:47] you shall be my people and I will be
[24:50] your God
[24:51] I will also save you from all your on
[24:55] the cleanliness and I will call for the
[25:00] corn and will increase it and lay no
[25:03] faman upon you one more scripture in the
[25:07] book of 2nd Corinthians 5 we want to
[25:10] come back here
[25:11] second Corinthians 5 this one scripture
[25:17] there 5 in 17 5 and 17 in second
[25:26] Corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any
[25:30] man be in Christ he is a new creature
[25:33] old things are passed away behold all
[25:39] things become new father may you bless
[25:42] your word sanctified in Jesus name Amen
[25:46] may be seated
[25:47] I want to turn back to the book of
[25:50] ezekiel 36 where i want to take a little
[25:59] thought tonight what does it take to
[26:04] make a christian life in other words
[26:09] what constitutes you know christian life
[26:14] and i know that you have your own
[26:21] perception on what does it take or what
[26:27] does it take to make a christian life
[26:33] everybody basically would like to feel
[26:39] that what they are doing or what they
[26:43] are keeping is what makes them a
[26:47] Christian now the word Christian
[26:53] I looked it up in the dictionary and I
[26:56] saw a different little meaning but this
[26:59] one really stood out because it was what
[27:03] I was kind of looking forward to try to
[27:06] explain what I want to use for the
[27:09] thought tonight and I hoped I'm not
[27:12] trying to decrease the knives anyone but
[27:15] I want us to understand that when Jesus
[27:19] a dotted Calvary he finished it and he
[27:26] did that alone everything that we have
[27:34] need of is here right now the word
[27:43] Christian it has several meaning but I
[27:46] like this one by the kiss says having
[27:49] the qualities demonstrated and taught by
[27:55] Jesus Christ I like the hand it's having
[28:01] the qualities demonstrated I believe
[28:06] that when Jesus came upon an earth he'd
[28:09] ever skated certain qualities if you
[28:14] noticed one quality he had he didn't
[28:18] come for himself he realized that his
[28:23] entire life was for somebody else
[28:29] he didn't went to those who were
[28:33] religious are all right but the Bible
[28:36] say he went to those that were without
[28:39] in other words he went to those that
[28:42] were cast out and maybe are set aside
[28:48] because they could be a part of a
[28:52] certain church group but he had the very
[28:57] qualities of God was within him
[29:01] and he demonstrated that that's so
[29:05] important because we've heard so much
[29:09] about Kristen Kristen and yet we don't
[29:14] see no qualities being demonstrated we
[29:21] try to make Kristen life as well if you
[29:30] join a certain church then you build
[29:34] Kristen or you repeat a certain Creed
[29:41] are you dressed so certainly if you pay
[29:46] your tithes and you shout or your
[29:50] speakings and all things are alright but
[29:53] it don't make you a Kristen you may
[29:59] treat your neighbors right you may be
[30:01] faithful to the church that's good but
[30:07] it don't make you a Christian see I
[30:09] believe with Jesus one day he this man
[30:14] named Nicodemus met him by night a rabbi
[30:20] a preacher and he came in asking him
[30:25] what must he do I believe that some time
[30:32] that we have allowed people to tell us
[30:37] that we are Kristen because we're doing
[30:41] a certain thing that they may want us to
[30:45] do I believe but Kristen life has
[30:51] qualities the love of God and that love
[30:57] is not partial and that love love in
[31:02] spite of not because of who you are and
[31:08] what you got that's not what Jesus did
[31:13] but he came and died for those that were
[31:16] without those that were without any hope
[31:40] or nothing like that but it was a
[31:46] quality that God had in him you know I
[31:52] was thinking about telling somebody you
[31:54] know that really under sundar standing
[31:58] that there are a lot of good people that
[32:02] really try hard to live a Christian life
[32:11] they try hard and then look like the
[32:15] heartily tried to deceive me can't
[32:18] measure up see because is not your human
[32:25] efforts it's a new work that God does
[32:32] within you see I want to go to because
[32:37] ego and look at this because I saw some
[32:40] things notice
[32:49] the Bible said in 2nd Corinthians that
[32:55] all the in Christ all things are new the
[33:02] life that you now live you live it by
[33:07] the Son of God Christianity as I see
[33:14] that people sometimes seem to get very
[33:21] discouraged because of are they are
[33:24] trying to do what the church is telling
[33:27] them to do but yet the qualities of
[33:30] Christ is not being demonstrated and
[33:36] sometimes they wonder why why am I
[33:39] always seem to coming up short why my
[33:45] life seems to be full of ups and downs
[33:50] and I can't seem to get settling it it's
[33:57] because maybe that you haven't been a
[34:01] fully baptized you know with the Holy
[34:04] Ghost though you made a confession
[34:12] though you've been just a father though
[34:15] you've been sanctified and all those
[34:20] things are good we need to do those
[34:22] things but I want to say you know any
[34:28] birth it produces a certain kind of life
[34:36] that's why Jesus told Nicodemus that you
[34:40] must be born again
[34:44] he acts and how how can I be born again
[34:50] that's the great question of the church
[34:52] world because they've been taught when
[34:55] you believed and you've been born again
[34:58] but then they don't see the
[35:02] qualities of God manifests are
[35:07] demonstrated they are struggling from
[35:11] new to live a holy life they still can
[35:18] vivid ever with the world and then in
[35:21] church at the same time but God is
[35:25] calling for separation see Christianity
[35:30] is a separate life there will skilltree
[35:36] and Lu say that you know you can't put
[35:38] new wine in old bottles where you can't
[35:42] mix the life of Christ with the world -
[35:46] there got to be a difference not just I
[35:52] was dressing and not just the thing we
[35:55] do out late but it's an inward work that
[36:00] only it's a supernatural experience that
[36:04] only God can give you and when that
[36:09] happened then you walk differently your
[36:14] conversations are different the places
[36:18] that you used to go you don't wanna go
[36:21] anymore
[36:23] the words I have no desire why because
[36:28] it's a new creation my desires are
[36:34] different it's in the Naturals like a
[36:38] woman you know who's expecting a child
[36:41] appetite changes why because it's
[36:45] another life is not to be born and she
[36:50] craved for different foods and and why
[36:53] because of a birth that is about to take
[36:56] place
[36:57] and I believe that your spiritual birth
[37:00] it'll cause you to have a different
[37:03] appetite the thing that you used to like
[37:08] you don't like them anymore not because
[37:13] you are better than anybody else
[37:16] but because of Christ came in so all
[37:20] things got to become new see God don't
[37:25] do patch-up work when God saves he saves
[37:30] to the utmost I wonder sometimes and I
[37:38] look at even the out of my life you know
[37:43] when God created everything he created
[37:47] everything in a certain way and every
[37:51] animal has their own characteristics
[37:56] they have their own qualities now a dog
[38:02] is is born the dog he don't have to ask
[38:07] any bark it's already in him why because
[38:12] it's the quality of a dog and it's be
[38:16] demonstrated even as a little puppy you
[38:19] here little puppy he been born they
[38:21] Charlotte you know why because it's in
[38:26] them they don't struggle to do that and
[38:31] see that's what I'm when Christ really
[38:34] comes in then you don't struggle to live
[38:39] a Christian life because it's inside of
[38:45] you so it'll work itself out side but we
[38:53] try to manufacture what God word is
[38:58] calling for without God doing a
[39:00] supernatural working us yet we still
[39:06] have the label of I'm a Christian now
[39:11] here in his ego if you notice in the
[39:18] 25th verse dinner one hour sprinkle
[39:23] clean water on you
[39:29] God wants to clean you he wants to make
[39:35] all things new
[39:37] that's why he washes us in the word
[39:43] sitting up under the word it begins to
[39:46] purify your heart it began to show you
[39:50] things in your life you know that that
[39:53] you need to be cleaned from I know we
[39:58] used to have a time that we had good
[40:01] moral standards that we used to keep you
[40:05] know but we're finding out in this
[40:07] generation here the standard has gone
[40:13] that standard of holiness and and living
[40:17] a clean life we used to understand that
[40:23] your body is the temple of the holy
[40:26] ghosts and Paul said that I present your
[40:32] bodies a living sacrifice holy
[40:35] acceptable to God which is your
[40:39] reasonable service so you have got a
[40:45] part to play that you you must
[40:48] understand that coming to into Christ is
[40:52] is to be our new and I can remember so
[41:01] clearly you know that when God touched
[41:05] me and I knew something happened though
[41:12] it was more to it but I know it was a
[41:15] new beginning because that even in that
[41:18] justifying state you know I wanted ah
[41:22] you know more out of life than just what
[41:26] the world was offered though yet I
[41:29] didn't understand fully what was going
[41:32] on but I know something had happened
[41:38] many of time we be in church and and we
[41:42] say we hear God's voice and how God
[41:45] speak to us and and what he told you so
[41:50] I believe that once you really hear the
[41:52] voice of God it'll cause you to react
[41:56] differently though you may not fully
[41:59] understand it but it'll be a chain that
[42:03] I come over yeah we see sometimes that's
[42:07] the problem we just don't want to come
[42:09] over us we will God to get in us until
[42:16] that happens we can do all the outward
[42:22] things that a christen are doing and we
[42:26] can have God on us and own our spirit
[42:29] but he got to go deeper than that God
[42:39] said I'll cleanse you and he shall be
[42:42] clean oh how how does it feel to to be
[42:50] rid of all your filthiness and from all
[42:55] your idols will I cleanse you in then
[42:58] gonna say now a new heart see everything
[43:02] God has given us isn't new it's not
[43:08] something patched up something like the
[43:12] people go to rehab to get rehabilitated
[43:14] no no God wants to change that heart
[43:21] kind of others say the man hard as
[43:23] wickedness a new heart also will I give
[43:29] you not only a new heart but a new
[43:32] spirit listen a new spirit will output
[43:40] within you this is all what God is doing
[43:46] see it's not something you work up or
[43:51] something you
[43:52] manufacture but is you dis yiling to him
[43:56] and let him take control yeah you
[44:01] surrendering your life to him
[44:03] seeing that's what God wants God just
[44:07] don't want us to have a label tag to us
[44:11] with no qualities and demonstration I
[44:17] was telling some people as I always said
[44:24] now especially I believe there has to be
[44:30] a first in the bottle state when he who
[44:35] is hungry in thirst after righteousness
[44:37] they shall be filled and I believe that
[44:45] our believe is here now that if there is
[44:48] another thirst in us you know to really
[44:51] examine ourselves you know and be
[44:55] certain that the qualities of a
[45:00] Christian is in us so many times that we
[45:08] we want a label of Christian life are
[45:12] only two when we come to church but
[45:16] that's not a Christian life when you
[45:18] ain't Church but it should be more so on
[45:21] the outside cuz see our light shine
[45:26] better in darkness and when when there's
[45:30] been a change in you didn't you take
[45:33] that outside of the church and then that
[45:37] life that you live it begins to magnify
[45:41] itself if the qualities of God is really
[45:46] there then what you have people will be
[45:49] thirsty for it I realize that there are
[45:58] some thirsty people looking for God
[46:02] and not just a form of God but they want
[46:07] the realities today I saw so much forms
[46:14] but they haven't seen no qualities
[46:18] they've heard the preaching you've heard
[46:22] the singing
[46:23] they'll had a sharpening the speaking in
[46:27] tongues but where are the quality is the
[46:30] love of God the long-suffering the
[46:34] patience the faith the godliness the
[46:38] temperance where are the real qualities
[46:43] that are you will love God regardless of
[46:48] in spite of what you have to go through
[46:52] your love for God won't change see real
[46:59] qualities look at what Jesus had look at
[47:05] what the early church had in the book of
[47:07] Acts before them when they when shields
[47:12] were with them in a New Testament he was
[47:15] teaching him a command missing and
[47:17] preaching them about the things in and
[47:20] you know he had a little problem with a
[47:23] man one time called Peter one of his
[47:27] great disciples one who he gave the keys
[47:32] to but he told Peter what they said
[47:36] Peter he said after you have been
[47:38] converted
[47:39] they descripton your brother he knew
[47:46] that Peter need a conversion a deeper
[47:50] conversion but as long as he was with
[47:52] them they were rejoicing and they love
[47:56] the Lord but Jesus even knew that why he
[48:00] told them even bookmark you know that go
[48:03] to Jerusalem and Terry wait until you be
[48:09] endued with power from on high Z he
[48:15] know that it didn't needed something
[48:18] even though they had the word that he
[48:21] talked but they need something to give
[48:24] them power to keep the words and you may
[48:29] hear a lot of good sermon is in a lot of
[48:32] good things preached but the Bible say
[48:34] the letter killeth but the Spirit give
[48:38] life
[48:39] I like their scripture I won't turn to a
[48:45] second Timothy 3:16 says all Scripture
[48:50] is given by inspiration of God about us
[48:57] in Romans if you have not the Spirit of
[49:00] Christ he said you another here's that's
[49:05] that's pretty tough so in order to be
[49:09] identified to be a really of Christ he
[49:15] must be in you see but too many times I
[49:19] believe that the people had been getting
[49:23] some kind of false security or a false
[49:28] hope that just having religion is good
[49:32] enough no you need to let him come in
[49:40] not just come in at the door but let him
[49:44] have preeminence the her brother Ernest
[49:49] remember he was saying one time what's
[49:52] the matter with Jesus you know they said
[49:55] he loved him and they don't mind him
[49:57] coming in but did I want him to be the
[49:59] ruler sometimes people love coming to
[50:06] church they love the things that the
[50:08] church does but they don't want God the
[50:11] total rule their lives they give them
[50:15] give him part of it in other words so
[50:18] they still can do things that they do in
[50:22] God I'm gonna serve you on Sunday always
[50:25] the night the Lord on the other
[50:27] Days learn our Lord I got some things
[50:30] that I need to do know God wants all
[50:37] he's looking for a total commitment it's
[50:42] like a man that when he married a woman
[50:45] marry they're looking for a total
[50:48] commitment and God is looking for a
[50:52] total commitment but notice that down to
[50:55] work that Jesus came to do you know
[51:00] because it was God living in him he
[51:04] couldn't do those thing except God was
[51:06] in him
[51:07] that's why his birth was a supernatural
[51:10] birth it couldn't be
[51:12] some contaminated sexual birth but it
[51:16] was a supernatural birth see because he
[51:20] was God on earth living in a human
[51:25] vessel to do what to reconcile the world
[51:29] back to himself what he was doing was
[51:33] showing that what you see me did through
[51:36] Jesus Christ I want to get in you to the
[51:42] church world don't want to let him in
[51:45] money in the book of Revelation in that
[51:50] the Laodicean Church age Jesus was
[51:53] knocking at the door and about to say
[51:56] they won't let him in he was knocking on
[52:01] the church door and they wouldn't let
[52:03] him come in I pray tonight that you will
[52:07] let him come in and let him go through
[52:10] you let him purge you let him wash you
[52:16] let him break those powers you know of
[52:19] the world out of your life got her beat
[52:23] about I said because you can't serve two
[52:25] masters you know it's time to let it all
[52:30] go let that all life go it ain't gonna
[52:35] do you no good here for a season you
[52:39] know you have pleasure
[52:40] but the end of it is death and God came
[52:46] to give you a life and to give you life
[52:49] more abundantly God
[52:55] something that would like to say but I
[52:58] don't know if I have time let's go goat
[53:02] me to one example and I'm gonna close
[53:04] with this in the Book of Luke can't seem
[53:09] to get away Luke 18 sometimes you know
[53:16] people feel that because they keep the
[53:20] church Commandments in their gonna be
[53:23] alright because that's what they was
[53:26] talked but ababa tell us search the
[53:31] scriptures don't take meant search them
[53:36] if you think you have internalized he
[53:39] the Scriptures testify of him the very
[53:44] qualities of God you know or can be
[53:48] demonstrated in your very life mom I'm
[53:55] not gonna read all of I'm gonna
[53:56] paraphrase 18 Luke 18 in 18 they say
[54:07] they're certain you know the story about
[54:09] a young rich ruler he came to Jesus and
[54:14] I some good master what shall I do to
[54:16] inherit eternal life they had a
[54:20] conversation in videos talking about the
[54:22] commandments and all those things and he
[54:25] began to reply Lord he said all these
[54:29] have I kept from my youth but in other
[54:33] words he kept he was liking something
[54:45] could it be that you've kept what the
[54:49] church said you read the Bible but still
[54:53] you feel within yourself you are liking
[54:56] something and sometimes we try to
[55:01] replace that with with uh-oh
[55:04] we'll have a chance to it give the
[55:06] people more entertainment give them a
[55:11] work to do in the church give them
[55:16] better programs and and socials life why
[55:21] because the real life of God they can't
[55:25] produce it their Creed's can't do it all
[55:30] the entertainment they giving them can't
[55:33] do it so what are they going to do with
[55:37] the people they go around in a circle
[55:42] after a while sever the God say this he
[55:51] said if you are born again and I'm
[55:54] closing if you are born again of the
[55:57] Spirit of God you are at Kristen c4 you
[56:06] are born again distressed that you must
[56:14] be no matter how much you may confess
[56:21] that your Kristen until those qualities
[56:27] until the very life of God come in you
[56:32] and and those quality begin to be
[56:35] demonstrated he said but only but you
[56:40] must be born again must be born of the
[56:45] Holy Ghost must come into your life in
[56:49] that mixture your Christian that seals
[56:53] you until the day of your redemption as
[56:58] long as you live right keep him with you
[57:01] you'll make it
[57:08] I'm telling you it's an hour to be
[57:16] confessing something and don't possess
[57:20] it we have enough trouble with people
[57:29] seeing so much hypocritical lives where
[57:35] to write in church the people have
[57:39] seemed to lost confidence they used to
[57:43] go to church for help not to say what's
[57:47] the use they are not living no better
[57:50] than I am they can't help me they see
[57:55] the to the preacher living double lives
[57:58] but they see this and they seeing that
[58:01] but I want to tell you though you may
[58:04] see all of that there are some people
[58:07] still that is possessing the life I pray
[58:17] that we all will examine I be sure that
[58:22] those qualities are being demonstrated
[58:27] not by Richert not because you work hard
[58:31] for the church but know that you will
[58:33] yield your life so much to God that you
[58:37] love giving him preeminence god bless
[58:41] you tonight
[58:49] raise the Lord amen was it what does it
[58:53] take to be a Christian amen praise God
[58:59] Christ's coming down inside of you
[59:03] living its life through you it's very
[59:09] important
[59:10] I was just praying as minister Parma
[59:15] sharing the word tonight it's a lot
[59:20] going on in the world today and a lot
[59:22] going on in our city in our country the
[59:26] world has come to a place that took a
[59:34] death to shake the whole nation in the
[59:39] world today and the people are crying
[59:43] out for change private of God said it
[59:50] takes a desperation to bring Christ on
[59:52] the scene people got to get desperate if
[59:57] you want God you got to get desperate he
[1:00:02] did hungry and thirst after
[1:00:03] righteousness shall be filled we got to
[1:00:08] get in desperation if we want to see God
[1:00:10] in our lives we want to see a real move
[1:00:14] of God we got to become desperate but
[1:00:18] sometimes as God's servant said
[1:00:21] something got to happen to us sometimes
[1:00:26] the calls us to get in desperation some
[1:00:34] crisis gotta happen in our lives to get
[1:00:37] us in desperation I thought about how
[1:00:43] the words to Blackson everybody's
[1:00:48] marching together for change
[1:00:51] they seem to come together we want to
[1:00:54] change rule things would be better and I
[1:01:03] believe that if the world can come
[1:01:06] together oftentimes it said the most
[1:01:10] subjugated place is the church the
[1:01:18] blacks are here the whites are there and
[1:01:23] I believe it's time it's comfort the
[1:01:26] people to get desperate and realize that
[1:01:29] God is calling us by one spirit into one
[1:01:32] body we cannot treat a black brother
[1:01:41] different from a white brother or white
[1:01:43] brother different from a black brother
[1:01:46] the time has come for change a brother
[1:01:51] is a brother once spirit are we baptized
[1:01:57] into one body Jesus got to be Jesus not
[1:02:04] a white cheeses are black Jesus but a
[1:02:06] God shows himself in head shows up for
[1:02:14] you and I
[1:02:17] they meant identified by his alarm that
[1:02:20] is godly love his character verified in
[1:02:27] his own characteristics a compassionate
[1:02:31] God that loves you dine he has no
[1:02:35] partiality they man well I believe that
[1:02:42] God knows them there are hears and God
[1:02:46] makes a way for you to get where you
[1:02:49] need to be
[1:02:51] he makes provision for you because God
[1:02:54] said whosoever will let him come take of
[1:02:59] the water of life freely I believe that
[1:03:04] it's something inside of a child of God
[1:03:07] that makes the right decision and makes
[1:03:10] the right choice
[1:03:11] I believe that something are deep in
[1:03:13] their heart begin to pull I want God no
[1:03:17] matter what it takes
[1:03:19] I want the Holy Ghost I want to live for
[1:03:22] God I want to be a Christian well it
[1:03:27] takes for me to be a Christian I want to
[1:03:29] live a Christian life
[1:03:31] oh yes the time has come that the real
[1:03:37] Christians sure praise God not be cold
[1:03:42] identified with a church identified with
[1:03:45] a group but identified with Christ and
[1:03:50] here's the word you abide in me and my
[1:03:54] words abide in you then you can act what
[1:03:58] you will and I'll do it people are sadly
[1:04:03] mistaken their attitude towards one
[1:04:05] another is their attitude towards God if
[1:04:10] you've got the wrong attitude towards
[1:04:12] your brother or your sister then
[1:04:17] where are we brother sister you can't
[1:04:21] love God until you can love your brother
[1:04:25] are you with me
[1:04:27] God is good in that I'm sorry because if
[1:04:34] they can watch for the rights that out
[1:04:42] there then I believe it's time for us to
[1:04:46] begin to get on our knees and cry out
[1:04:49] cry out for the injustice that are done
[1:04:53] not only in the world in this city but
[1:04:56] all injustice oh this is sin and God has
[1:05:05] called us to a higher calling he calls
[1:05:09] us into the kingdom of God and coming
[1:05:13] into the kingdom of God that God is
[1:05:16] calling you in the fight for something
[1:05:19] oh it's so much higher than what man is
[1:05:24] fighting for he meant the fight the good
[1:05:28] fight of faith lay hold on eternal life
[1:05:31] he meant realized that your battle is
[1:05:34] not Amen earthly battle your kingdom is
[1:05:37] not of this world but your fighting
[1:05:39] either
[1:05:40] hallelujah award they may get spiritual
[1:05:44] wickedness in high places you're
[1:05:47] fighting against the powers of darkness

[1:07:49] change in the church what we're changing
