[30:01] for this cause i paul the prisoner
[30:05] of jesus christ for you gentiles
[30:09] have you heard of the dispensation of
[30:12] the grace of god which
[30:13] is given me to you lord
[30:17] how that by revelation he made known
[30:21] unto me the mystery as i wrote before
[30:24] in few words whereby when you read
[30:29] ye may understand my knowledge in the
[30:32] mystery of christ
[30:34] which in other ages were was
[30:37] not made known unto the sons of men
[30:42] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[30:46] apostles and prophets by the spirit
[30:51] that the gentiles should be fellow ears
[30:56] and of the same body
[30:59] and partakers of his promise
[31:02] in christ by the the gospel
[31:06] whereof i was made a minister
[31:10] according to the gift of the grace of
[31:14] god
[31:14] given unto me by the effectual working
[31:18] of his power unto me
[31:23] whom least than
[31:26] is less than the least of all saints
[31:30] is disgrace given
[31:34] that i should preach among the gentiles
[31:38] the unsearchable riches of christ
[31:42] and god bless you reading towards you
[31:43] may be seated today we want to talk on
[31:48] on authority unsearchable riches
[31:51] amen unsearchable
[31:54] riches god
[31:58] is a rich so rich
[32:01] that he calls an unsearchable
[32:04] praise god how can i buy how can we by
[32:07] search and find our god
[32:10] amen god weighs a past fighting out
[32:14] but thank god that paul says it came a
[32:17] period of time that
[32:19] god had hid certain things
[32:22] from amen the children the sons of god
[32:26] but
[32:27] it was at a time period that god was
[32:30] going to release what he heard
[32:33] so by the grace of god as we know that
[32:36] in this age
[32:37] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[32:40] amen and god has unveiled himself today
[32:45] oh god the mighty god has been a veil
[32:47] before us
[32:50] and we have seen amen that god
[32:53] locking was in the uh dispensation of
[32:56] time and when god dealt with the jews
[32:59] under the dispensation of the law
[33:02] they met god was dealing amen and
[33:04] bringing
[33:05] amen a new revelation
[33:08] amen and he was uh revealing unto them
[33:11] that grace of god has appeared
[33:16] amen so what was locked up under the law
[33:20] amen ready to be revealed at the last
[33:23] time
[33:24] god locked it up and shielded up and
[33:27] nobody knew
[33:28] amen praise god this grace that god was
[33:32] getting ready to release
[33:35] among the people so the pharisees and
[33:39] the sadducees and the jews
[33:41] which were god chosen people amen
[33:45] did not have the revelation that god
[33:48] was getting ready to reveal
[33:51] what paul said he made it known unto us
[33:55] amen the apostles and prophets
[33:58] amen that we might give it to you
[34:02] and i want to say uh the riches
[34:05] the unsearchable riches are available
[34:07] this morning
[34:10] god had made certain things available
[34:13] that was not available beforehand
[34:17] amen so god in this last day
[34:21] amen has made available to you
[34:24] and are the things that he told daniel
[34:27] to seal it in the book
[34:29] until the time of the end
[34:31] [Music]
[34:32] amen but now at the time of the end
[34:36] god will release and make those
[34:40] things that was sealed up available to
[34:43] you and now
[34:46] so by the grace of god as god had hidden
[34:48] things
[34:49] in christ amen and he wanted to make
[34:53] them known
[34:54] god has a way of making things
[34:58] known amen and god always
[35:01] uses a man amen to make
[35:04] things known that he wants to reveal to
[35:07] the people
[35:09] amen but god chooses vessels
[35:13] amen in order to reveal his revelation
[35:17] praise god he could have just said well
[35:19] i'ma reveal it to everybody
[35:21] but god amen revealed it to
[35:24] paul said to us the prophets and the
[35:27] apostles
[35:29] amen he said but i i i want you to know
[35:32] that god had a special anointing on my
[35:34] life
[35:36] i was uh uh i was less than the least
[35:40] of the apostles the uh of all men i i
[35:44] i you know i don't i don't even have uh
[35:47] amen
[35:47] praise god uh any business amen amen
[35:51] that god will give this gift
[35:54] that god will restore upon me these
[35:57] revelations that i'm
[35:59] praise god and use me in this way i'm
[36:03] not worthy of it
[36:05] because i'm the less in the least of all
[36:09] are you with me so paul was showing the
[36:12] humility you know
[36:14] that's what god does when we see
[36:16] ourselves
[36:17] as insufficient amen that we're not able
[36:20] amen
[36:20] and sometimes we see ourselves as
[36:22] oddballs as
[36:24] and nobody's but god wants to do
[36:26] something with those that
[36:28] look down on those that despise and
[36:30] reject it god want to use
[36:34] oh yes he does oh god when you look like
[36:37] you the least of all
[36:40] amen then god amen wants to elevate you
[36:43] again
[36:44] amen god when we think with something
[36:47] when we're nothing and that's when god
[36:49] amen hallelujah our pride are getting
[36:52] our way
[36:54] god cannot release revelation revelating
[36:56] knowledge to you
[36:58] until you humble yourself till you
[37:00] recognize your condition
[37:03] i recognize how weak i am but when i'm
[37:06] weak he's strong thank god i'm not
[37:10] worthy
[37:11] but he meant of the abundance of
[37:12] revelation that he's bestowed upon me
[37:15] but by is a a gift that god has given me
[37:19] amen i i i he's a
[37:22] he's leaded to my charge he's giving me
[37:26] a choice to keep
[37:28] amen and then these revelations that
[37:30] amen he could have chosen anybody
[37:33] else but god has chosen me that's the
[37:36] least
[37:37] nonetheless the least of them all
[37:42] praise god i you know i persecuted the
[37:45] church

[1:16:09] not what
[1:16:10] connor god is made available to us they
[1:16:13] met
[1:16:14] the tools that within god in god god is
[1:16:17] what
[1:16:18] love isn't that right and god is
[1:16:21] released to you and i
[1:16:23] amen made available to us the weapons
[1:16:26] they meant that we are to use are you
[1:16:29] with me

[1:17:03] understand who you are
[1:17:05] if they only knew who you are they
[1:17:08] wouldn't have never persecuted you
[1:17:12] are you with me but because when you
[1:17:14] don't know who you are you respond back
[1:17:20] amen because you got to recognize before
[1:17:22] they can recognize who you are
[1:17:23] you got to recognize who you are god has
[1:17:27] chosen you in christ before the
[1:17:29] foundation of the world

[1:18:00] i'm closing but let me go and try to
[1:18:02] finish this
[1:18:04] maybe the 18th verse may be able to
[1:18:06] comprehend
[1:18:07] with all the sinks the breath the lymph
[1:18:09] the depth and the height
[1:18:11] and the know the what the 19th verse and
[1:18:14] the know the what
[1:18:16] the love of christ which passes what
[1:18:19] knowledge see god love is unsearchable
[1:18:23] it passed all knowledge so you can't
[1:18:24] find out
[1:18:26] it's love praise god
[1:18:29] so god loves you in such a way that
[1:18:32] praise god
[1:18:33] nobody can love you like god love you
[1:18:37] amen people want love but the love that
[1:18:39] they are looking for
[1:18:40] is only through the baptism of the holy
[1:18:42] ghost
[1:18:43] it's only when christ can get in your
[1:18:45] heart and only
[1:18:46] when when christ get deep enough down
[1:18:49] inside you
[1:18:50] see because it's some depths of the love
[1:18:53] of god
[1:18:54] so sometimes we love i mean we feel a
[1:18:57] little of the love of god
[1:18:58] but the depths of the love of god that's
[1:19:01] what keeps you
[1:19:02] that's when you're rooted and that's
[1:19:03] when you're grounded
[1:19:05] amen but when you just you know i love
[1:19:08] the lord i love the lord i know he loved
[1:19:10] me
[1:19:10] amen not just you know on surface love
[1:19:14] but you got to go a little deeper down
[1:19:16] to it passes your
[1:19:18] your flesh and passes your spirit your
[1:19:21] you know
[1:19:22] and goes down into the soul amen
[1:19:25] and it finds root there it's got to be
