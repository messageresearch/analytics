we said or done anything that's not like god that you would forgive us tonight god that you would bless us just here just now lord for we love you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen god is good amen let's turn to the book of matthew the 28th chapter about god's grace i'm trying not to be before you long amen matthew 28 you feel all right tonight amen matthew 28 and very familiar scripture 28-16 you got to say amen and it reads then the 11 then the 11 disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth our power tonight is given unto me into heaven and earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even until the end of the world amen may god bless you reading of his word you may be seated tonight by god's grace just for a moment i want to minister to you on a little topic that the lord put on my heart and i ministered about a week ago or so and i entitled it power amen power i like how hearing the scriptures how jesus when they saw him he said all power is given unto me come on he didn't say some power did he but he said all power is given unto me and if all power is given unto him then how much does that leave the devil tonight that that leaves him what powerless many times we fearful and afraid but what are you afraid of come on don't you know that the god you serve declared that all power is given unto me hallelujah you know many times what we see like even here in the scriptures that no matter what god does some people just won't believe you know the bible here talks about that when they saw him the 11th saw him the bible said and some doubt it come on i asked the question tonight what more hallelujah he lay the foundation he don't open the way i ask you what more hallelujah can he do you know sometimes no matter what god does people are doubting come on they saw him walk on water they saw him raise the dead hallelujah they saw him heal the hallelujah and he told them that in three days i'll rise again but yet when they saw some doubted hallelujah you know i always say that if god don't never do nothing else hallelujah he already done enough to cause me to believe him and sorrow until the day that i see his face hallelujah how many believe that tonight you know i was sharing with some of the guys at work and i say as you know we living in a time where you know a lot of even some of my friends they're at work they they say they don't believe in god hallelujah ones i told them one day i said i'm going to prayer and they asked me who you're praying to come on and i asked them the question i said do you believe in god do you believe in christ jesus christ come on i said i want you to think before you answer that and i began to talk to the boys i said what it is i said many times people say that they don't believe i says but have you ever been in that room hallelujah when the doctor walked in and said you know i'm doing all he can do hallelujah nothing else i said have you ever been to that place where every everywhere you turn hallelujah just shut in your face have you ever been to that place the way even your own mother and father forsook you hallelujah i said because when you get there hallelujah you'll learn to call on guard then oh jesus how many believe that tonight hallelujah i seen many that say they didn't believe but when they came to a crisis that same one say god if you be god hallelujah then why all your miracles that we heard about hallelujah i don't know about you but i don't want to get to that place i said if he don't do nothing else he already done enough that i believe him hallelujah just for who he is how many believe him tonight oh god i said all power come on he's given unto me you know god he done so many great things i can share with you by the grace of god tonight so many testimonies the way god has brought us from come on i don't know about you but i thought about the song sister brenda lewis said that he did it for me come on maybe you never felt lost and alone hallelujah but i was lost and alone one day maybe you never felt that a burning hell was gonna be your home i felt that way one day hallelujah oh jesus maybe he never dried your eyes so swollen by the tears nobody else know what you was going through and all of a sudden god came in the room oh hallelujah anybody didn't do it for you but he did it for me oh jesus hallelujah somebody ought to give him praise somebody ought to say lord thank you hallelujah oh jesus i said all power come on it's given unto me that's what he says come on tonight we know he said we won't even be able to finish at all but i said all power we're living in a world today where the people are struggling for power come on most of the world wars and things were fought because of what how hallelujah men and greed and all these things wanna you know the first one in heaven was fought over what power come on somebody said it was the battle of wheels satan said he says hard not falling o lucifer son in the morning he said i will hallelujah i will come on he wanted power didn't he it wasn't good enough just to be in his presence but he wanted power hallelujah i don't know about you but i said god i just want to be in your presence that's all i want god i don't have to be the biggest name i don't have to be in the biggest church god just let me be in your presence that's all i want hallelujah oh jesus i might just be a dog keeper but let me be the dog keeper i might just be the sound man but let me be the sound man long as i'm where god is that's all i want long as i'm down or experiences blessings in his glory oh hallelujah powell come on it's a struggle people want power come on all these things are says but you know you look at the world today it's a struggle right power struggle on the job i've been a part of a job where a power struggle destroyed the whole company come on everybody want to be in charge nobody want to follow come on hallelujah but i said one thing paul said follow me hallelujah as i follow christ he is our leader he is our god hallelujah oh jesus come on power come on i said what is power i asked the church the other day i said what is power come on and why do men crave it come on men crave it don't they come on won't that be influence won't that control hallelujah but it's something that the holy ghost does when he comes into a man's life he get rid of all his will come on your will your battle of will you get rid of your will lord is not my will no more but god it's your will whatever you want on me lord that's what i want to do hallelujah oh jesus do you believe that tonight i said what it is come on i'm being a part of companies come on we're struggling things fell apart hallelujah you know i was ministering not long ago on the foundation and it says that you are you are you are stones lobby stones come on god has fitly framed you to do what to build up the house of god you don't have to worry about it nobody can't take your place you'll cut out hallelujah for a specific place and god want to put you in that place and you know the building can't be complete without you that's what it is i said a lot of times hallelujah we ride by big buildings don't we hallelujah we marvel at this statue in the structure but we don't understand and recognize you might not even see the pillars up under the porch hallelujah but it's the most important part of the structure hallelujah that's what holding the building together many times nobody see you on your knees praying nobody see you crying out for god to help the pastor hallelujah help the preacher oh jesus but without the pills come on oh we might see beautiful buildings come on pretty windows and all these things might have a big choir all these things but without the pills hallelujah it wouldn't be no building would it come on show me a grand mama that's all newspring show me a wife or a husband there's a prayer team on their knees praying god help your children god get a man of god a word god help them hallelujah and i'll show you a pillar i'll show you somebody that's keeping the church going i'll show you somebody hallelujah that oh with all power how many believe that tonight oh jesus i said power come on men craving it come on what is it they want they want that that control that influence but what is real power hallelujah real power only comes from god hallelujah his spirit real power is the power to love your enemies come on power to bless those that curse you power to let somebody spit in your face and you'll go on hallelujah and love that man that's real power hallelujah oh jesus you know i was ministering on the other week and it was talking about how those police officers come on i said they ordinary men just like you and i hallelujah but when they get up in the morning and they put that uniform on hallelujah and they put that badge on they'll do things that they wouldn't normally do hallelujah they'll stand in front of 18 wheels won't they holy hand up hallelujah they'll block traffic they'll stand out there stop say stop hallelujah you'll hear uh tires screeching brakes the streets and all that people might write why they they under the influence of that police officer come on hallelujah and he knows that he got all the force backing them up hallelujah i said but what about a child of god armed with the word of god hallelujah don't you know you got more authority and power than all angels in heaven hallelujah you don't have to take what the devil has given to you oh jesus hallelujah you know that you got all of heaven backing you up he said i give you my word speak my word hallelujah all in heaven is backing you up oh jesus you know god does whatever he wants that's one thing one thing the lord showed me he does whatever he wants whenever he wants and nobody can't tell

church and i remember we got in the car come on i said god does whatever he wants whenever he wants we got in the car and we get over there and the lady was over there fighting and carrying on saying all kind of things we stood out tonight we said a little prayer but we got out the car we got out the car and you know it was a bunch of people trying to subdue this girl they couldn't so we got out the cars i i looked from a distance i said sister we kind of pray for you she turned around and said all kind of things to me and brother sam but i don't know why but when she began to talk like that something got hold to me hallelujah i grabbed brother sam the bible i get brother saying the bible i walk straight up to him come on they touched when and all i reached out my hand i laid on it for him when i did that she fell to her knees she began weeping and crying hallelujah oh jesus we begin praying with him right there when we looked up everybody at the crack house was broke down in tears you tell me god can't do what he want to do when he want to do it hallelujah oh jesus i said god to go to the crack house will you hallelujah if he sends you will you go oh jesus come on i'll never

another crack spot come on something about the crack spots come on wow those people be crying out for help but something got them bound i believe jesus would go come on how many believe that tonight i believe jesus would go wherever people had a desire and a need hallelujah me and brother carl went down and we pulled up to the house and it was a bunch of people out there i tell a testimony all the time brother carl jumped out the car before the car even stopped he had flyers in his head for the tent revival he i hear him telling them you know i mean the boys was back there doing their thing he said y'all won't come to church but we're gonna bring church to y'all he began passing out flyers and all but what got my heart was when brother carl was walking back to the car it was a man dressed in a full suit at the crank house on a sunday afternoon he walked behind brother carl with tears coming down his face and he said i got dressed to make it to church this morning go to church this morning but i never made it come on you know i believe god knew him and i believe god knew the desire in his hearts though the devil hallelujah had him bound god was going to send somebody by that way to pray for this man and give him deliverance how many believe that tonight hallelujah you know we stood outside in the road praying hard as we could car parked in the middle of the street we might have been looking fanatical but nevertheless i was just thanking god i said because god's got a purpose in everything hallelujah somebody give god praise tonight [Applause] i said what it is come on power come on power people fighting over power and control come on but he's christ jesus said all power is given unto me come on and he said to many that believe he gave them power didn't he say that hallelujah to become the what sons of god many times we look at power it's just in the demonstration of the gifts in the spirit hallelujah but the real power is in the power of transformation how god can take a sinner and turn that man into a child of god a god can take one that's bound on drugs and alcohol and turn them into a minister of the gospel that's the kind of transformation i love hallelujah god i i'll never forget i say when i come to the lord my favorite song is god has smiled on me hallelujah he has set me free come on that little verse i came to jesus just as i was weary hallelujah it wasn't sad but i found in him a resting place and he has made me glad hallelujah i said i don't care how you are tonight come to jesus hallelujah come to jesus just like you are hallelujah god will work with those broken pieces how many believe that tonight god will work with those broken pieces you know we serve a guard that can work with anything come on world that throws you away but god can work with anything he can take anything and turn it into something marvelous what the world is rejected hallelujah that's who god that's what god wants how many believe that tonight that's what god wants that's what god want to use oh jesus you know i said what it is power control fighting all these things but the real power that that we we love to see is the power of transformation hallelujah it's not just good enough to be a church member come on but it's in the transforming come on be not conformed to this world but be you what transformed by the what renewing of your mind god got to do something in your spirit y'all got to do something down on the inside that you'll never be the same hallelujah and that's what we want that's what we love i said the power come on a transformation god don't you know god wants to transform you and it don't just stop there but he wants to change you from glory to glory come on somebody sing a song from glory to glory he's changing me you look back at where you are i like that song it says i just can't give up now hallelujah i come too far hallelujah from where i started from but the devil might be fighting me hallelujah i'm replaced on every side but i come too far i just can't give up now i don't believe hallelujah he brought me this far to leave me i don't believe that hallelujah i don't believe god brought us this far to leave us i don't believe god did that just leave us out here hallelujah but with all ours against us watch god did hallelujah i love that little sin then came jesus come on then came gee here he is hallelujah in the darkness hour then came jesus hallelujah with all the hearts was then came jesus he showed up didn't he hallelujah and he was right on time do you believe that tonight come on i said power come on many times you look at like we're saying you know people want power don't they look at things that that uh it's a lot of things that make people feel empowered you know a lot of times a friend of mine he says that he got his concealed weapon license so he says he started walking around carrying his gun he feeling power don't it not knowing that no matter if you got a thousand guns it's still gonna take the grace of god to keep you it's still gonna take the grace of god to watch over your home how many you believe that tonight hallelujah but many things make people feel empowered you know i was i was thinking of a once i was at a funeral down in florida in front of my friends passed away and i was in there with the preachers before they came out and this is my first time you know being like in a group like that of that prestige come on of that class hallelujah you know they begin to go around the table identifying who they were the one a bishop of the church he began to say that he went to oxford and yale it ain't too many that could say this got a degree in all these things the one next to him after he got done the one next to him began to talk about how he went to touch the airmen in all his great standings come on people feel the power hallelujah don't they you know the man next to me was laughing and they tell them they're telling me they say you know why you laughing because he was the mayor of boynton beach come on i said i'm sitting in a room with some big boys but i began to say to myself i said lord when they get to me what am i gonna say hallelujah because all i know is that i'm a sinner saved by grace all i know hallelujah is i was lost and one day god found me all i know hallelujah is that he raised me up hallelujah he been keeping me ever since that's all i know hallelujah i said oh i come from a small town nobody don't even might not even know our name hallelujah i said but god knows my name hallelujah i don't have all that to say i'm just a sinner saved by grace i'm glad to be saved tonight hallelujah oh jesus i said even come on even with all of that and don't have no power all of that and can't come bring guard on the scene what does it mean come on i can show your grandmama they can't read or write hallelujah she never been in the oxford no yeah you talk to about it she might not even know what you're talking about hallelujah but she know how to get down on her knees and cry out for her children proud for the for the taste of god she know how to bring guard on the scene hallelujah that's what i'm talking about i said what it is come on bringing god on the scene come on that's what it's all about i'll share with my wife the other week i said you know no matter how god blesses us no matter what god does with us in our life don't let nothing change us but let us be those same simple people that make the prayer meetings that come to church faithful every day that give the last damn out of pocket to those that need it don't let nothing change us hallelujah oh jesus somebody give god praise tonight i said power come on come on power he said all power is given unto me come on fighting for control one thing coming to god as i was ministering the other week on the battle of wheels one thing coming to god come on you got to let go of your own will come on you know paul talked about it he said that when i desire to do good evil is present with me come on he talked about a war going on what it is your body wanting to get this glory come on yo your flesh wanting to get glory but it's not all about that don't you know that christ he said i'm divine and you're the branches without me you can't do nothing so we glory sometimes and who we are and our flesh and all these things not knowing that if god would cut us off we wouldn't be nothing hallelujah but every day we thank god for his grace every day we thank god for his mercy we thank him for waking us up one more day hallelujah oh jesus somebody give god praise tonight i said what it is come on power he said all he said all power is given unto me come on when we think about power we look at it a lot of times many many times in the wrong way come on but we find that you know all these things what do they do they come with it but i says lord when i don't know what else to do god i just want to yield to you and let you have your way in my life how many want that tonight don't you know god wants to use you god has a word that he want to put in your mouth come on to use you in a special way hallelujah but it takes us learning how to let go let go of ourselves let go of our will and desire let god have its weight i don't know about you but i says the more you know i was sharing with someone i was saying that when uh a friend of mine i went by his mother house and visit her and she began to tell me she says ernest she says what happened to you boy that was you told me and i said wait a minute i went outside and i grabbed the bible out the car and i walked back in the house and i began reading to her a little bit and i began reading to her a little bit more and i says what it is i said the more i read i became what i read the more i read i began to let go and let god have this way the more i read i began to believe what i read hallelujah and that's what happened i said what it is sometimes you can't explain things everything ain't meant to be it should be explained is it come on but god know what he doing hallelujah god know what he want out your life just give it to god how many believe that tonight i said come on power come on i thought about that song there's power power wonder working power where in the blood hallelujah of the lamb somebody say the blood lost his power come on he ain't lost his power come on all these things like i said even with technology and all these things are failure but god is still real he's still doing supernatural things all the time i was telling my wife this morning about something that god did come on and that's what that's what you know like the brother brother brooks said last night people saying restore to me to joy unto me the joy of my salvation but you should never lose that joy come on it's something about that every time i think hallelujah that he ain't there he does something else for me every time i think that god is solid god does something else to do what ignites you i don't know about you but i'm on fire now just as i beat when i first started hallelujah god is still burning on the inside hallelujah how many believe that tonight but i said that's what it is you know lord doing something this morning i said what it is god be working with us all the time but don't you know we're missing because we're looking for them in the wrong places come on we look for god in the wrong places but god is working with you come on speaking to you asking you to believe him hallelujah all you got to do is believe god how many believe that tonight i said the power come on i didn't want to be long tonight i always been a short-winning preacher come on i said all that oh what it is you know god just encourages you on your journey come on keep building on it hallelujah keep building in that prayer life keep building on the testimonies that god gave you don't you know that what these little things that god has taken you through they're they're setting you up for the climax you think about david he wasn't just out there and uh with the sheep for nothing come on but when the lion came that was just building them up when the bat king that was just building them up hallelujah the problem was that that day the people wasn't built though so when goliath came they were running and hiding but god's got a people hallelujah it might just be that little brother over here or that little sister over there but god has got somebody to raise up to meet the challenge of the hour i believe that with all of my heart hallelujah i said lord whatever you're doing in the season don't do it without me come on i want to be a part of it don't you want to be a part of what god is doing come on how many want to be a part of what god is doing let us buy our kids thank you somebody tell the lord thank you somebody say lord thank you lord i love you [Laughter] hallelujah come on i said power what is real power god wants to transform you tonight come on you've been struggling you've been battling but then hallelujah god is here to turn on the light god is here to pick you up from the place that you are and set you on high i said do you believe that remember when they saw some dollars don't doubt tonight lord i love you lord i need you lord i can't make it without you help me lord i find my way i've been struggling i've been battled help me lord come out of this place where i'm at hallelujah lord if it's you then we come well god has beaten you to come tonight come to the altar come while the blood is running warm in your veins come while the master is calling hallelujah god is calling you tonight you don't have to leave the same way you came but you can leave transform tonight you can leave better hallelujah and what you did when you came in lord we thank you god bless your children [Music] somebody hear hallelujah praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] praise god praise god amen [Music] praise god if you haven't given your life to jesus tonight you ought to do something about it praise god we're talking about the unveiling of god the body god unveiled before us god hides himself in a veil brother sister god hides himself in simplicity reveals himself in the scene god unveils himself tonight see sometimes when we talk about the unveiling of god [Music] we're talking about something that past tense something that's future tense but failing to recognize that god unveiling himself now but god hiding himself behind a veil called jesus the wicked god was in christ reconciling the world but to himself god interval praise god [Music] god had filled himself in this hour in an end-time bride praise god of people amen despised and rejected the stone that was said ignored of your buildings the same has become the head of the corner that's how the headstone had shook to come amen and it's great grace grace hardship has come but we got to recognize the head has come to the body praise god and the body is connected with the hay there's no more you but we see jesus in broad form jesus christ in broad form oh recognize who you are recognize who you are praise god [Music] corinthians tell us that we are written epistles written and read of all men praise god we're written episcopals amen i said to the church on sunday morning read me praise god read me praise god i i just amen what would they see praise god because your life is a book being wrecked and one day he opened up hey man praise god and i want to see myself in the book praise god because your name was written there praise god if your name was there then you in the book and somebody ought to recognize amen read me praise god [Music] god [Music] the reason why things are not happening is because the people are failing to recognize where god is amen because they fail to recognize where god is they amen talk about a god they made it though he's a something but he's a very person amen he's a person he's jesus christ and that same jesus amen we don't look for him in heaven for the kingdom of heaven coming not would meet and drink but his righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost amen because god all that god was he poured it into christ and all that christ was he put it in the bride he put it in his church so where's god now [Music] that's not why it's gone now can't you recognize that god [Music] is in you if he's in you praise god then read me what if i'm looking at the book and i'm reading do i see jesus am i looking at jesus what am i reading i said read me praise god we got to read the book praise god our lives amen ought to be what the book said the bribe would be amen in this hour amen jesus said such a scripture for in them you think you have eternal life but they are there to testify for me praise god i wonder what was amen the structures that testified of you can you say like john the baptist the voice of one crime and oneness praise god that's who i am i recognize my day i recognize my message i recognize who i am i see my name in the book praise god god has been unveiled amen he's not here praise god the world can't recognize it but you and i we recognize who god is and where god is praise god you know reason why folks amen you can claim to have something but when we're reading reading you when we really read you we can be a part and we can be talking about something and we can be saying i'm identifying with it but when i read you that's not that's not what the book said the bribe would be praise god read me i'm reading and i'm looking at the tree and i'm seeing what kind of fruit is producing and i'm saying i'm reading praise god it doesn't say praise god good fruit praise god this tree is saying praise god brother and sister what kind of fruity on your tree bearing you said read me amen what kind of fruit are you bearing praise god thank you brother ernest he left me a little space that's all right praise god hey god all right [Music] when we first started amen coming into columbia in the different areas throughout south carolina everybody would leave me to last and every preacher would just hand me the mic praise god and they said well brother simmers got it let's bring it home amen praise god it was all right for a season but brother and sister now i i think we've come to a place where we put our brakes on praise god we've learned terminology we learned how to act like the other folks act praise god but before the holy ghost was acting out now we're looking for a sign or our name amen you know you got to call amen approximate praise god if we say uh uh john the baptist it don't mean nothing and we said paul it don't mean nothing and we say uh amen anderson it don't mean nothing if we say amen oh lord but if we say sandwich that don't mean nothing but and we said william branham it means everything but you got to recognize amen where is god now amen you got to recognize god amen should be god shall be that same jesus he's so much alive as he was praise god yesterday he must be the living god today doing the same signs and oneness the same god doing the same thing in your life but if he's not it's all right to be a frog and look back [Music] praise god the frog look back to the past amen praise god and don't praise god you'll never recognize who you are you got to recognize who you are and if you're not that then you need to pray through pray through for your breakthrough are you with me get on your knees and get something that's real all the holland screaming and chumping amen and you ain't got nothing but when you get it right your life is changed you talking about walking in power walking in a car again praise god walking in the power of the holy ghost praise god brother brooks talking about the life the life the life praise god i said praise god this bible is god in letterform but it takes somebody it takes your faith praise god the spirit brings the word to life are you with me i said the spirit amen bring the seed to life isn't that right the water amen brings the seed to life amen now what am i saying you being saved amen the holy ghost amen praise god to call the seed to live isn't that right praise god to the seed of abraham praise god shouldn't the spirit of god call that word to live and manifest jesus christ in your life praise god that's what it's all about the manifestation of jesus christ praise god him living again praise god you'll never be able to achieve and accomplish anything until you recognize your position praise god and while the holy ghost has positionally placed you in the body praise god and if you are who you say you are dan praise god read me praise god read me brother read me sister praise god hallelujah i wish you can tell somebody when you're looking at me what do you see see some folks are being honest with you praise god i see a hypocrite praise god i i i see somebody praise god playing and causing a lot of folks to stumble cause a lot of folk to fall [Music] praise god and that's what happened you see someone else hypocrisy people ain't met standing in the way but others won't let them in praise god brother and sister it's time that the bride recognize who she is praise god we don't just want successful crowds but we want to see jesus and people they may get a hold of jesus [Music] i said if somebody come to the tent and they can receive the baptism of the holy ghost it's worth all the thousands of dollars that are spent amen if somebody received the baptism in the holy ghost let somebody get a hold of god i don't care how many thousands of dollars spent but somebody get a hold of god amen there's just one center come to repentance it's worth all of that praise god brother and sister he said it don't take all of that i tell you brothers and sisters it takes more because i want you to wake up because you know how the pharisees they thought oh certainly if he had known who that woman was that woman was [Music] washing his feet where her hair that woman y'all see how it is brother and sister if i was reading you [Music] you know what we are we looking for jesus are we really looking for jesus because the pharisees thought they were looking for the messiah but they had already been preached a messiah amen and that messiah was going to come according to their persuasion the way they thought but jesus always come amen in a way that the people are not looking for him are you with me jesus the creep right in once you've already formulated and already got it all mapped out how he did come if he comes surely he'll come to chaophas and he said chiamas i have arrived the high priest you know oh he'll come to the bishop but he'll come to this one brother and sister if god might come to one of these little young men on the front and god can you start using them but who want to listen to them who won't listen the holy ghost is no more in control we've already already put god and somebody said we'll put him in a box we've already formulated that the holy ghost holy ghost can't move no more why because amen it only can move with certain scenes you know when i know that you know sometimes a person can say two words and i said that's a this particular nomination and sometimes i remember i was witnessing to a brother and as i was praying for the sick some people came in and i had never seen them they never seen me i said be quiet i know who you are listen huh i said just required i'm trying to pray for the sick person and they said uh uh i says look i said i'll get to y'all later they kept me interrupting so i we had to pray and pray for the brother they said well who are we who are man who are they i see y'all church of christ you know if god can do that tell me who they are without them opening their mouth look like able to fell down and repent and say oh you know what people do that don't change them you know i i've seen folks say if i if if i saw the blind eyes open i heard the lord folks said tell you all kind of stuff until it happened praise god i got i baptized a little filipino girl over in uh england and she said i was telling about all the things god was doing and all the miracles she and i tell him about how the demons uh protest she said i want to see that the first service she came to church lady fell out demon possessed and she going like a snake you know and we prayed and cast the devil out she said i don't want to see no more and that's the way we are we just want to see it way because i saw it amen miracles don't mean too much but every time i don't think it's fair brother every time we put the tent up amen we seen the run we're seeing somebody get about the wheelchair amen we see we have testimonies of people getting healed camps in it every time it hasn't failed yet praise god god does miracles signs and oneness praise god but yet you know i i think we've come accustomed to it are we brother but people have come accustomed to miracles amen there used to be a time when when folks saw a miracle they go get everybody i remember god healing uh a brother thompson mother and and brother keith said uh brother simmers get up here to the hospital amen everybody all the sick get about to be she was in a coma uh for uh so many months and the doctor told me he said brother simmons look here he pulled a cover back and he showed me a foot look like it was rotten he said that's gang green and it's going all throughout the body he said you go out there and you tell that family that [Music] she been in this coma and on this machine and that's all keeping us alive if she came through she wouldn't have no mind so you go out there and tell them i said dog i said they believing in trusting god and i'm believing with them i said let me tell you a few testimonies i said they had a young man around the corner in the same wall on the same floor and he had when i got there they called me for my funeral when i got there they said the young man heart was so weak that they sedated him and put him in ice and if they take him off the ice it's hard so weak that he gonna die the nurse talking to me she said it'll take a miracle i looked at her i said i believe in miracles are you with me what about you brother sister amen we got that no amen that god want to use each and every one of you [Music]

a fellow minister right there tell that family pull a plug and let it go [Music] i said no doc i said i believe god it's mama how many you believe in miracles praise god she came out of the coma went home [Music] are you with me [Music] god is god amen see brother and sister it's nothing too hard for god amen you get what you expect if you want god see god want to use every one of you praise god what i said this is the written word it only takes your faith to ignite the word are you with me you have faith in this word your faith ignites the word and the word become fire see jeremiah said it was like what and that's what it's unique though everything that you have need of is right here in the book all you need is the faith to believe it and what you need tonight you certainly can have that it's all in the word your healing is in the word everything you have need to have is in the word just have faith to believe let it stand [Music] praise god [Music] praise god [Music] don't leave here without your miracle don't leave here without your blessing praise god if you want to be delivered you can be delivered if you just want to say i believe the message uh i i think i'm saved brother says read the book if you read the book that the book say you saved and you acting like a devil living like a devil praise god read the book but if you have faith enough to say god i believe what you said amen and i'm going to accept you according to your word and i'm apply faith to your word and all the joke that's in my life amen my life is a mess and i want to get out of the mess let me thank god that i can get out we don't have to wait till the prophet get back to do it i said jesus is the prophet i said jesus is here right now praise god and you want your deliverance jesus is
