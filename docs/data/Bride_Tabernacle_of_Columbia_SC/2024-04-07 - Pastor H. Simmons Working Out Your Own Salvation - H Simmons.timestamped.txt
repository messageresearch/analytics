[43:27] to see a concert or uh you know and they
[43:31] take up so many offerings like you're
[43:32] paying to see a
[43:35] concert but we come to church and we
[43:37] ought to come to church to worship God
[43:40] Amen and we ought to worship Him in
[43:42] spirit and in truth he said I therefore
[43:45] the prison of the Lord beseech you that
[43:48] you walk worthy of the vocation
[43:50] whereever you are called with all Loess
[43:52] and meekness endeavoring to keep the
[43:56] unity
[43:58] and you know I I thought about that and
[44:01] I thought about I beseech you that you
[44:03] present your body as a Living Sacrifice
[44:06] holy and acceptable to God which is your
[44:08] reason for service and be not conformed
[44:10] to this world but be you transformed by
[44:13] the renewing of your
[44:15] mind there's a conforming to the world
[44:18] and there's a
[44:20] transforming that takes place by the
[44:22] Holy
[44:23] Ghost now you can be conformed or you
[44:26] can be trans
[44:27] form are you with me some often times
[44:32] the Christian is is conforming to the
[44:36] world instead of being
[44:40] transforming instead of allowing the
[44:42] Holy Ghost to transform and they
[44:45] conform okay I'm not going to get into
[44:47] that because it's not for Sunday morning
[44:51] amen but anyway uh Revelation talks
[44:56] about dead
[44:58] Works amen Revelation three talks about
[45:02] dead
[45:03] works I you know I don't want go I I
[45:06] don't believe God is satisfied with dead
[45:09] Works
[45:11] amen and then uh uh Hebrews 6 says
[45:15] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[45:19] amen and then it talks about dead Works
[45:23] he he said no Revelation say that you
[45:25] have a name that you live and you're
[45:27] dead Philippians said about Philippians
[45:31] I mean Hebrews 6 talks about dead
[45:34] works okay so here we are I don't have
[45:39] time to go through all the scriptures so
[45:42] one talks about dead you have a name
[45:45] that you live but you're
[45:47] dead Okay and the others talk
[45:51] about let us leave the principles of the
[45:54] doctrine of the land hand on the hand
[45:57] and so forth and repentance from dead
[46:00] work are you with me so we need to go
[46:03] ahead on because sometimes our works is
[46:07] dead and I thought Lord surely the
[46:10] Harvest is plentiful we in the end time
[46:13] in this end time you look around the
[46:14] Harvest is pitiful but the
[46:18] labors are few when Jesus
[46:22] called you know I I wrote down payday
[46:26] pay payday you're going to get paid
[46:28] whatever is right you get paid that's my
[46:31] subtopic payday are you with me he said
[46:34] whatever is right I'll
[46:35] pay are you with me God is a just God
[46:40] and he's going to pay you what's
[46:42] right whatever whatever and then in my
[46:47] little prayer I said who you working
[46:50] for look at somebody ask who you working
[46:55] for cuz you know if you work you expect
[47:01] what you expect to get paid but you got
[47:04] to realize who am I working
[47:08] for you know you we often times uh sing
[47:12] the song My M Mama used to love to hear
[47:14] that song when I made the work I've
[47:18] done are you with me
[47:21] but the work you done May the work I
[47:25] done what speak for me but you want your
[47:29] word to speak for you okay so look uh
[47:34] Revelation uh 14 I said
[47:37] right Revelation 14 and 13 it says here
[47:43] excuse
[47:44] me 14 and 13 they probably got it up
[47:47] there before I get it 14 and 13 it says
[47:51] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying
[47:54] unto me who's he talking to
[47:58] who's he talking to I Heard a Voice from
[48:01] Heaven say unto
[48:03] who who Who's me I hope God is talking
[48:07] to
[48:08] you I hope you hear him talking to you I
[48:11] Heard a Voice from Heaven you know John
[48:14] was talking about that day but can you
[48:16] personalize it can it be personal to you
[48:19] and I would it work for us
[48:22] now amen is the word of God present
[48:25] tense amen the Bible said okay
[48:31] it's right blessed are
[48:34] who blessed are the dead that what die
[48:38] in the Lord die in the
[48:40] Lord now we understand that when we
[48:43] become Christians we die to
[48:47] ourself for Romans 6 said we were buried
[48:50] with him in baptism into death the like
[48:53] as Christ was raised from the dead even
[48:56] so we shall rise to walk in newness of
[48:59] what life are you with me so we die to
[49:03] ourselves but we live as those that are
[49:07] alive from the dead death has no more
[49:10] dominion over
[49:12] us so he
[49:14] said if we then be risen with Christ
[49:18] then in Colossians 3 seek those things
[49:21] which are what above
[49:23] above for my oh I I'm not going to get
[49:26] into
[49:27] my life is here with Christ in God are
[49:31] you with me so he says here blessed of
[49:34] the Dead which die in the Lord from
[49:37] hence forth yay said the spirit for they
[49:47] what uh that they may
[49:50] what that they may
[49:53] what see the Bible said come unto me all
[49:56] you that labor heavy Laten and I'll give
[49:58] you rest
[50:00] resten see a Christian Life we're not
[50:04] amen we're not working for the devil no
[50:07] more but we're resting in
[50:10] Christ we'll cease from our own
[50:14] Works
[50:16] amen we used should do our own thing
[50:19] we're not doing that
[50:20] anymore are you with me so he said that
[50:26] they may
[50:27] rest from their
[50:29] labor now it's talking about in the
[50:33] kingdom of God when we in the kingdom of
[50:36] God brother and sister we are labels
[50:40] with him we are his workmanship created
[50:43] in Christ Jesus and the good works we're
[50:46] working out our own soul salvation
[50:50] working out our own salvation with fear
[50:54] and trembling
[50:57] surely God called us into the kingdom he
[51:01] calls each and every one of us as
[51:04] Christians for a purpose surely there's
[51:08] a
[51:09] work that I can
[51:13] do are you with me God calls you because
[51:19] he saw that it was a work that he called
[51:23] you to
[51:24] do but when I I first became a Christian
[51:28] the first thing I wanted to know uh as a
[51:31] Christian what can I
[51:33] do I just didn't want to come to church
[51:36] and come into church and sit down and
[51:38] look around and as though I I I just is
[51:42] that that's not me I don't know about
[51:45] you maybe you you just feel happy
[51:48] sitting around doing
[51:49] nothing you know what I'm saying I was
[51:52] talking about Betty and Frank how we
[51:54] didn't have to worry about visiting the
[51:56] sick cuz they were going to be there
[51:58] visiting now they done got up in age and
[52:01] we got to get somebody to take their
[52:02] place you know what I'm saying they was
[52:05] going to visit if you were in the
[52:07] hospital or whatever they was going to
[52:08] visit amen so by the grace of God
[52:12] there's a work that I can
[52:14] do are you with me you must some people
[52:18] just get saved you know what they do
[52:21] they just sat there and just look I I
[52:23] can't understand that I I couldn't
[52:25] understand that I believe when God saved
[52:28] you he saved you for a purpose it's a
[52:30] reason why he saved you first of all I
[52:33] said I can't
[52:35] sing I'm scared to stand up in front of
[52:37] people so I never
[52:39] preach so I can't do much of nothing I
[52:42] can't I couldn't see nothing that I
[52:43] could
[52:44] do I can't have read so I sure can't
[52:47] teach
[52:49] nobody so I I said what am I going to
[52:51] do I almost look at myself and that made
[52:55] me feel kind of bad cuz I couldn't see
[52:57] within the church anything I could
[53:01] do and I so the bishop told me go sang
[53:05] on the
[53:07] choir and y'all remember brother
[53:10] Jackson Kenny he came out he said did
[53:14] say that sing
[53:15] this I said I can't sing I'm just being
[53:18] obedient he told me to come sing on the
[53:20] choir I I know I can't sing and he had
[53:24] to know and he told me sing and I cried
[53:26] he
[53:27] said okay do
[53:30] this he said you said the right thing
[53:33] you can't
[53:36] saying so so he gave me some notes and I
[53:41] thought I was back in music in high
[53:43] school in music he gave me the quarter
[53:45] note half note I I knew all of that but
[53:47] I wasn't interested in that when I was
[53:50] in school I was interested in knowing
[53:52] all those notes and I said I ain't going
[53:55] back there
[53:57] and I didn't go by I tried to be
[53:59] obedient you know but I knew I couldn't
[54:02] sing all the
[54:03] time you know what I'm saying but I
[54:05] wanted to do
[54:08] something so it was later on then when I
[54:12] got in a small group and small
[54:14] atmosphere where it was about 20 people
[54:17] in the whole church but 30 at the most
[54:20] then I could work in there I started
[54:22] teaching Sunday school working with the
[54:24] young people and all of that that was in
[54:26] my brother-in-law
[54:28] church so little by little I gained a
[54:32] little you know I could do something and
[54:36] in the big church where it's 500
[54:39] whatever or more people I I felt out of
[54:44] place I I felt you know I'm but surely
[54:49] doesn't work but I wanted to do
[54:51] something I just didn't want to just
[54:53] come to
[54:55] church I want wanted to do
[54:59] something but I
[55:01] find that what's the difference now I
[55:05] believe when God save you you it said
[55:09] let your light shine you you want to be
[55:12] involved I'm G tell you something people
[55:15] that I find that get saved and not
[55:17] involved in the church they're not going
[55:19] to stay
[55:21] long they usually going to go back out
[55:24] there and they're going to work for who
[55:26] they've been working for before they got
[55:29] saved if people don't want to be
[55:31] involved in the church they're not going
[55:33] to stay in the
[55:36] church when they get out of environment
[55:39] and they don't want to do
[55:41] nothing you know they're not going to
[55:43] stay you ain't got to worry about a
[55:44] thing after a while sooner or later
[55:48] they're
[55:49] gone because they don't want to be a
[55:52] part of what's going on see Paul said
[55:55] help those women that label with me in
[55:57] the gospel isn't that
[56:00] right and and he recognized that Jesus
[56:04] had certain that ministered of their
[56:06] substance to him so they found a way of
[56:10] giving Paul had lyia or whatever they
[56:14] that had made things in so them and and
[56:18] was able to help
[56:20] out it it's surely that something is a
[56:23] meal you could cook a something that you
[56:27] can just contribute to the
[56:32] kingdom he said call for the praying
[56:36] women somewhere along the line I go I'm
[56:38] going find my
[56:40] place I'mma find my place in the kingdom
[56:43] and I'm going to be a part of God's
[56:47] kingdom because he called me for a
[56:48] purpose and have you found look at
[56:52] somebody and ask have you found your
[56:55] place
[56:56] surely there's a place there's a purpose
[57:00] and a place for
[57:02] you and you need to say Lord show me my
[57:07] place and show me my
[57:09] purpose see there's a purpose for you
[57:12] being in the earth amen you here for a
[57:15] reason am God could have not let you
[57:18] even come in this planet call Earth but
[57:22] you here because God allowed you to get
[57:24] here and while I'm here here Lord what
[57:27] is my reason for being
[57:30] here and my reason for being here is to
[57:33] serve and Worship the Lord while I pass
[57:36] on through to my eternal home then Lord
[57:40] let me find my
[57:43] purpose I want to know my reason why I'm
[57:46] here and I want to know my purpose
[57:50] because a person without purpose they're
[57:53] lost and confused and anything goes
[57:57] anything happen because I have no
[58:00] purpose am
[58:02] amen see when you go to school and you
[58:04] don't know what you want to major
[58:07] in you can minor in
[58:10] everything and you get a de Plum and
[58:14] nothing are you with me I I don't know
[58:19] what I want to do we get we give you one
[58:21] of those anything goes you know what I'm
[58:25] saying
[58:26] I went all these years and I got a depl
[58:29] in
[58:29] nothing you know what I'm saying but you
[58:32] got to find your
[58:34] place sometimes we go for a certain
[58:37] thing and it doesn't work out and then
[58:39] we have to change to this and we change
[58:41] to that until we find out amen what
[58:44] works for me am
[58:47] amen amen what I feel comfortable in
[58:50] doing so when I get ready to go out into
[58:53] the world I've gotten a a a degree I
[58:57] kind of know what I what I supposed to
[58:59] be doing am so in the kingdom of God
[59:03] people without purpose in the church
[59:06] find themselves doing nothing and get
[59:08] all confused and others
[59:13] confused because why I'm not doing
[59:15] nothing I'm talking you out of doing
[59:19] nothing
[59:22] see are you with me because you working
[59:27] for
[59:30] somebody whether you know it or not you
[59:33] are
[59:35] working okay he said let let me let me
[59:39] get back to this verse at the last part
[59:42] yay the yay said the spirit that they
[59:45] rest from their labor and their
[59:49] what their Works do follow them and that
[59:53] that it's sad that that people well I
[59:58] did nothing so you resting from your
[1:00:01] label what
[1:00:03] label Lord I pay my tithe and my
[1:00:06] offering I came to
[1:00:08] church what what what what do I
[1:00:12] contribute to the
[1:00:13] kingdom the man that had one Talent
[1:00:16] Jesus knew what to give him one because
[1:00:18] he knew was going to do nothing with
[1:00:19] that
[1:00:20] one are you with me so he gave him one
[1:00:24] where he wouldn't have no excuse
[1:00:26] but he said I'll take this one and I'll
[1:00:28] do
[1:00:30] what he
[1:00:32] multiplied what he did Buri it see the
[1:00:38] little that you got amen instead of
[1:00:40] multiplying it you take it and bury
[1:00:44] it you're not even interested in the
[1:00:47] what God gave you you'll bury that
[1:00:50] you'll find it
[1:00:53] insignificant I I'm insignificant
[1:00:56] you know how we play the pity
[1:00:59] game we play that uh uh pity and and and
[1:01:03] you're going to find out if you grow up
[1:01:05] folks ain't going to pity
[1:01:08] you you get on the job you better you
[1:01:11] better produce if you don't produce
[1:01:13] you you what out of
[1:01:17] here so you got to find amen that you
[1:01:20] going to have to produce in
[1:01:23] life and if you're not prod dting in
[1:01:27] life folks going to
[1:01:29] just run over
[1:01:32] you because you're not
[1:01:36] produced are you with me some folks
[1:01:39] don't want
[1:01:41] nothing and nothing for
[1:01:46] nothing but you got to have those that
[1:01:49] want to be productive they want
[1:01:54] something they want to see others have
[1:01:59] the Jesus that they
[1:02:02] got I want others to to know the Lord
[1:02:06] like I know
[1:02:08] him I want them to know the joy that I
[1:02:12] have the peace that I
[1:02:15] have I want others to experience the God
[1:02:19] that I serve am amen but if you are not
[1:02:24] convinced that he's good to you
[1:02:28] if you have not tasted and found out T
[1:02:31] and see that the Lord he is
[1:02:35] good but if you don't know how good he
[1:02:40] is then you don't want anybody else to
[1:02:43] have this
[1:02:45] Joy I'm saying but you got to get in a
[1:02:48] place do I really have I really
[1:02:52] experienced the love of God have I
[1:02:54] really experienced is Jesus Christ as my
[1:02:58] personal savior is he really real to me
[1:03:03] I am I fabricating or am I just going
[1:03:06] through the
[1:03:07] motion am I just putting am I
[1:03:09] impersonating or what am I doing am I
