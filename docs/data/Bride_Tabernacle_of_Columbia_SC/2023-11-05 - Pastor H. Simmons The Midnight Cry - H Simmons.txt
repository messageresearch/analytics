better Lord for we're trusting you now in Jesus Christ name amen Matthew 25 and often time we come back to the scripture because we constantly [Music] remind we have to remind ourselves what time it is if it's ever been midnight it is now if it's ever been time the time of the end sir what time is it is the time of the end I believe we're at that time so Matthew 25 and one it says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five of them were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no o with their lamps not enough just to come to church but the the wise took allil in their vessel with their lamps while the bridegroom T they all what slumbered and sleeping you got to wake up W up wake up amen look around and tell somebody to wake up wake up amen don't sleep now amen and at midnight there was a what midnight there was a cry made behold what rise come go yah to meet him then all those virgins arose and what what it's triming lamp time trim it and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your A for our lamps are G out what a Time midnight and your lamp's gone out no more light your light is not shining but the wise answer said not so so least there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourself and while they went to buy what happened and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was what the door was shut God bless you readers word you may be seated if I can just talk to you a little bit this morning I know you're familiar with the Midnight Cry we will understand that there was a midnight before and then that midnight it was midnight for the Jewish Jewish Jews and in the midnight for the Jews let's look at the midnight for the Jews we said the Old Testament was types and shadows of the real thing what was it to come as the Jews they had the church in the wilderness they had a church and the Jews had a Midnight Cry the Jews had balum the church has a balum the Jews had Jezebel the church has a jezebel Jews had a Babylon the church has mystery Babylon are you with me so here we are in the church ages we're at the End of the Age Midnight Cry what is this cry all about let's see what the cry was then then we understand what the cry is now should at midnight should we have a cry they had a cry the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yes today and the day and forever and God would not bring uh judgment unless he what warn you God warns you before judgment if God didn't warn you then why should he bring judgment on the people that he didn't give an opportunity amen but God warns us before he bring judgment Even in our lives God got something inside of us a little warning signal a red light Flash before us don't do this don't do that that's a red light flashing telling you not to that's a warning signal sometimes your heart beat faster when you're doing something wrong so they got a lie detective tell when you're lying are you with me things change in you because you're not made to be a liar are you with me so by the grace of God we God is trying to some ought to be ticking in your spirit because you want to know what time is it is it really midnight or are we just presuming we're venturing without Authority but is it real how to be people behave themselves then in the Jewish time is how the people will behave themselves again but you and I that are the elect and the chosen of God should take care as the world Amen don't understand and don't amen don't want to understand that is midnight AM it's all right to come to church but are we taking it serious the midnight CH what what do you mean what is it all about okay Isaiah 40 Isaiah 40 and3 Isaiah 40 and3 it says the voice of him okay the cry is the voice of him that cries in the wilderness now we said the Midnight Cry The Bride the the voice of him that cried in the wilderness prepare what prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a what highway for our God are you with me every Valley shall be exalted and every Mountain sh and Hill shall be made alow and the Crooked shall be made what and the rough places plain amen you know our lives we were we were crooked our lives were out of shape amen but God came amen and said the straight and narrow way isn't that right that so God saw you and I as individuals and God Amen praise God he made our pathway straight he said wi is the way to lead it to what destuction straight and narrow is the gate leading to righteousness are you with me amen praise God aren't you glad that God gave you a word amen to straighten out your life he said everybody go right here next U and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord has what SP has spoken it goad the voice said cry and he said what shall I cry says what all flesh is grass and all the goodness thereof is as the what flower of the field the grass wiard the flowers faded because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it surely the people is what the people is gr amen the grass wer the what but word Word of Our God shall stand forever I'm G tell you brothers and sisters the word of God shall stand amen the word of God shall stand forever amen are you with me and you got to realize that you want to be caught in the word I want to be in the word of God because that's what's going to stand everything else going to fail you everything else going to fall but I want to be in the word because the grass wigger the flowers faded and all fleshes as amen amen as the grass amen but I want to be in the word amen yes cuz that's what's going to stand when it's all over with yes Matthew 3 now he said the voice of one crying in the wilderness Matthew 3 And1 it says in those days came who John the Baptist preaching in the what Wilderness of Judea John the Baptist ain't that right preaching and saying what how about now is it time for you and I to repent if it's midnight is it time to repent in that day amen the people had their own opinion about church and what was right but they didn't recognize the voice that was crying am is it today a voice that is crying in the wilderness a voice that is crying that is promise see you got to know the promise for your day you got to know what to be on the expectation what God has promised just to come to church sing songs uh uh just to stop drinking or stop smoking just to stop lying and stealing and stop foric and commit adulr God want you to know the promise it's far beyond that am I want you to recognize your day and the hour you live in I want you to know your promise I want you to know what time it is because if you know what our time it is you would get ready to meet the bridegroom but if you don't know all you know about how the church how how they sing how the people I like the people but do I know my day do I know what time it is amen I do I have much time to get myself right you can't get yourself right God gets you right if you got to give your life to God God I can't get myself right I can't make myself a better person but you can God I want you to I I I want to give my life to you because I know time is winding up okay it says say repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand it it's at hand you believe that y'all believe that his kingdom is at hand amen Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am that you may be also amen I'm coming back for you amen he promised to come back for you a't that right are you are you expecting him to come or you thought he told you something that's wrong he it's not right if you believe he told you the truth he said th my thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen one day the king is going to come back and I want to be ready to meet the king amen because I believe that we at the end yes amen okay he says for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah Isaiah saying the voice of what now we said the mid night cry for the Jews amen they were anticipating something and hopefully we'll get there in a minute they were anticipating amen uh the the Midnight Cry they knew that amen that there was supposed to be a cry made there was supposed to be something happened to warn them to get them ready for the bridegroom they knew that amen yeah we come to church we we don't know we just come to church we know the Jesus know about Jesus know he's died on the cross and and and the way we live like we are halfway know that you know what I'm saying the way we act like you know because we we give our our head to him but we don't give our heart to him amen intellectually we know in in our minds we know but have we given him him our heart have we said God I don't want you to have my head I want you to have my heart for where your trag is that will your heart be also amen yes are you with me so when you give Jesus your heart that I mean you give him everything you got Lord I want you to have all of me why should I hold on to it because I ain't no good cuz all flesh is as grass and all the goodness of man is as flowers the grass W the flowers faded but the word of the Lord shall stand are you with me what shall I cry cry all flesh amen if cry that you we are no good amen the only thing going to stand is the word I need to be I want the word and that's all g stand give me the word so he said the voice and one crying in the wilderness for this is if you want to know what the voice is he said for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah Isaiah the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord and make his path what straight okay go ahead okay and make his path straight now who are we talking about make his path straight um y'all know that in in previous verse we was talking about John the Baptist isn't that right John the Baptist was the you think you think the people that went to church then believe that they went to church every Sabbath day and they didn't believe what they were reading in their Bible and what they were supposed to be anticipate they didn't even believe it when it came to pass all they did was went to church read their Bibles and the preacher preached about amen The Voice some one crying in the wilderness but they could not recognize him when he came it came off the pages it was a promise but they couldn't recognize it people said in the church with their head up like I got mine you ain't giving me nothing I got everything I need the Bible said they'll be rich increaseing good and have need of what nothing I told you I got to walk in this church I tell them not to walk but they keep walking amen it's time to set and hear the word are you with me but when we have special needs you got to take care of special needs okay seem like when I get to my major Point folk move y'all be careful don't move because that's the time you know the devil got a way of making an urgent when it come to the point that you need he want you to miss it you know what I'm saying yeah we we got to get some brothers stand at the door that brother I talk about the brother in Progressive he he give me a hard time I said and I was talking to another brother he said yeah that brother I know who you're talking about he strive I said yeah he give me a hard time I said I come you can't sit where you want to sit I said oh oh he I said I I said okay I ain't I don't want to fight but by the grace of God that's what we got to do you know we the the word when it comth forth if the president was speaking you don't move are you with me when God is speaking his word r it now it's a special need of urgency we know about that you know we got people that got to go when they got to go they got to go to don't bother with them and I ain't messing with those people amen okay now let us go on I I got to get there Malachi 4 Malachi 4 midnight there will be a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh amen there'll be a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh y'all realize the only way I'm going to help you is to tell you the truth if I tell you something wrong and you think oh you don't love me if I love you I'm going chasing you I'm going chastise you if your parents don't chastise you when you wrong you got a bad parent he said which father going to correct you after his own pleasure but the heavenly father correct you because he loves you are you with me I ain't got to take nothing for nobody no don't take nothing for nobody not even God are you with me let's go Malachi 4 and five behold I send unto you what well you know people had the idea when John the Baptist came on the scene we don't need you who you can't tell us nothing you think people listen to John and told John we don't need you the reason why they didn't need John because they had Moses and they had Abraham they all were dead but we had them Abraham was our father Moses they told him that kind of stuff you know people with Attitude the same attitude those people had in that day is the same attitude is the the people have in this day a't nothing new Under the Sun nothing changed it's still the same same people I mean different people Same Spirit are you with me the same kind of attitude people go to church and they tell God how you know I come to the point if you got two or three people left let's have two or three but let's have some people that want God it can you know if you got people that want God it makes a difference you got a church full of people and people don't even want God man you got a mess are you with me Noah got down to eight people that's all I wanted to go that's all I wanted to hear it comes down to whether or not you want God or not you don't want God you in the wrong place go go play some ball amen go shoot some dice like I used to do on Sunday morning are you with me but God saved me one day I didn't want to shoot dice no more on Sunday morning are you with me when God Sav you he saved you for a reason and for a purpose amen that you can worship and serve him Lord I want to be in church I want to serve God I want to live for God and even now more so cuz I see what's going over there in Israel amen I see that time is winding up I see we right at the end I want to be ready I want you to be ready amen that's why I can't hold nothing back I can't hold nothing back because I know it's too late I know the time is short you can get mad at me but get mad at God first because I didn't write this Bible he did are you with me f you tell people truth I don't think he y to do it that way well you come and take my place and do it your way I D got something to say about everything amen you can do a better job I want you to do it are you with me that's what I you know are you fussing at the people yeah I'm fussing but that's all right it takes that sometime are you with me it takes that sometime you said Mama yeah Mama just be quiet daddy don't tell me oh no no no you going to listen a good parent tell you you going to listen I don't care how grown you think you are you're going to listen I don't care who you think you are you going to listen come to church see it got to first US start at home if you disrespect Mom and Daddy you going to disrespect the pastor in the church are you with me I ain't trying to be you know uhuh no no no no judgment begin in the house of God praise God we coming with the word to help you but if you want to play games that's up to you you want the word that's what you get okay he said behold I send you Elijah the prophet you know when God sent them Elijah they didn't want him they cut his head off didn't they people I it was so upset read uh let me see I I said somebody read on behold I sent you Elijah to the prophet before the what before the end of time before the great dra day before the Great Tribulation period I'm going send you Elijah the prophet and what he's going to do and he shall what and the hearts of the children to the fathers least I come and what okay now let us go to uh Luke 7 uh 1 and 17 Luke 1 17 okay God is good amen things are moving so quick and time is so short but yet people want to play games people don't want to you know get down the business and cry to God and you saying look at what's going on over there look at the world and its condition and you say brother you better take it easy I better do all I can to try to compel you to get in before it's too late amen because God has a voice crying out in the wilderness God got a voice crying out to you and I amen that's why he said to help us amen I don't need it I don't need it I'm save I got go ahead on who you think you are Mr Big Stuff how need God I don't need that I got Jesus I don't need that that's the same attitude we got Moses we got Abraham we don't need you are you with me you know you know people when you fail to recognize what God is doing in the hour you live in you miss God all together it's going to take me being humble y'all might think I'm a little hard this morning but it's going to take humility it's going to take a a a broken and a contrite spirit a humble Spirit but it come time that you when you trying to warn somebody you know I I said my next old neighbor when I when our house was on fire he didn't say Mr samon you know your house on fire it was 4 5:00 in the morning and he didn't hesitate he ran out the door and he was crying Mr Simmon your house on fire house on fire you didn't have on no T-shirt no clothes on all he had on is his under unhs cuz we saw him on camera you think I y'all y'all got to live right y'all got to be nice and be good cuz it Hell Fire coming low he didn't care how he sound he didn't care how he look he was it was watering us because he was concerned about us he cared about us I didn't say man why you come out there looking like that but you you should have put on your under cloes we could have been burn up too he went on the under cloes and we burn up he didn't think about himself and how he looked he thought about us cuz he didn't want us to get burnt off a't that right but you don't care about the cner you don't care about that one on the way to hell you don't care about the way that they burn up or not you don't care whether or not their soul be lost you don't care nothing about it all you care about I don't know what you care about the attitude of the people today I don't know what they concerned about the devil has done something to the people Minds that they don't even want God they don't mind coming to church and singing a song don't mind coming and paying their tithes and offering but they don't want God don't want God because the god that they want is a God that's going to satisfy them because they know God I know God nobody can't tell that's what attitude of the Jews you can't tell me I don't have it you can't tell them I don't know they had their own type of attitude and they're aric spirit and you think John was patting them on the back all right y'all he said all right you snakes you Generation of Vipers he said who has warned you to flee from the Wrath to come oh you here come oh you know y'all to the nice and y'all the Israelites and I know you God chose the people and I know you're good people I know you love the Lord uhuh he said you Generation of Vipers who have warned you to flee from the rra to come somebody said that's a wild man that's a mean man he ain't even got on clergy clothes he ain't got on no look at him look at look how he dressed look how he is that make every time you come repent that's all you got to preach that's all you saying us repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand repent amen get ready to meet God he's here oh Lord but how many people listening to him man I'm tired of hearing that same old sermon I heard over and over again you think I got to believe that I ain't got to believe it I'm tired of hearing about repent repent I'm already all right look at me I'm saved sanctify Holy Ghost fill fire bapt TI nobody tell me nothing I got it all right thank you Jesus help us Lord help me Jesus help me Jesus is this what John had to deal with is this the attitude and spirit of of the midnight in the Jews dispensation is these the kind of people John had to cry out in the wilderness and preached repentance to that they need to repent and turn to God and get ready for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand is this what he had to deal with stiff neck and rebellious people are you with me if he did if he dealt with that so do we have to he talked about John the Baptist the Bible says uh in 17th verse of John the Baptist he shall go before him in the spirit of power of who elij Elijah Amen to what now we know that was John the Baptist and the what do you think those people thought they were disobedient no so what we need John for I Don't Need No John I'm I ain't disobedient I don't need him I already got Abraham

respect God's word to know how to conduct Our Lives to know how to behave ourselves and God will bless us amen so I got to get back here he says what John would do he turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of just and to what Make Ready a a people what see John that's midnight the Jews was getting ready Jerusalem rejected Jesus Christ and Jerusalem had the armies compassed about Jerusalem and Jerusalem was trotten down by the Gentiles the blood uh came out of the city up until the horse Bridal in ad70 why because they rejected their day The Voice tried to warn them and get them prepared to meet Jesus Christ but they did not take heed and to this hour and to this day the Jews as a whole has rejected Jesus Christ as their Messiah but to us as Gentiles we say we believe that Jesus is God we believe that he's the Messiah he's Lord all we do is hypocrite as a whole a lot of hypocrisy are you with me so do we really believe what we say we believe are you with me so by the grace of God uh uh St John 4 and and 19 St John 4 I got to speed up because my time are y'all with me this morning y'all might go home sad I don't know what that man was for fussing about but some people going to take it as fuss some people going to take it as he was trying to tell us up the one to take it as fuss I don't care if you speak it please don't do wrong please do right I don't know what he was talking about who was doing wrong I ain't doing no wrong don't care how you say it you can say good you can say bad you can say soft you said rub you still ain't going to please everybody are you with me but if you get to praying and say God Amen you know I you have to pray about things and sometime the fault ain't in who you think it is the Fault is in you are you with me see sometime we have to search ourselves and say Lord is it is it me if it's me Lord help me to get my get right Lord help me to get right because if it's in me I want it out of me are you up me and God knows I'll never disrespect God's people not intentionally now I done got plenty of weaping from God are you with me could God say these are my people not yours so God God know how to whip you chastise you isn't that right he'll chastise you he'll bring things back to you are you with me and I hope God do that for everybody in here God will bring things back to you so John 4:19 it says what the woman said unto him sir I proceed you know the woman at the well he told a woman she had five husband one she was with one her none of hers right and she said sir I perceive that thou are a prophet isn't that right the Jews when they saw him they perceived that he was bezug he was the devil there going to be people in the church instead of recognizing who Jesus is they going to say he's a devil his own people the Bible said he came into his own and his own people in the church people that supposed to an knowing but this woman that was had five husband and the one she had one none of hers and was shacking up she said sir when he told him yeah go get your husband she said I have none he said you said well you had five and the one you with is not your husband are you with me and he and she said sir I proceed to thou prophet go ahead next our fathers Worship in this mountain but and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to what worship go okay Jesus said unto her now a woman in bad shapes you know the word didn't you uhhuh everybody else looking down on that woman but that woman knew the word didn't she no matter what kind of shap a you see her uhuh huh yeah all them picking at this woman thought this woman was no good ain't that right but look at her she knew that word she said uh Jesus said unto her woman amen believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the father amen ye shall worship Ye Ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews amen but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him amen God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in what spirit and in truth and the woman said unto him I know that thou art the Messiah I know I mean the woman said I what I know that the Messiah y'all got me y'all with me this morning y'all all right y'all feel pretty good I know that the Messiah cometh which is called when he cometh he will what tell us all things amen Jesus said un her what I I I'm here amen see Jesus when he see that hungry heart and that thirsty heart and that humble heart and that person that has need of the water The Living Water God would do something for that person but that person that with that old attitude that they already know everything God ain't going to give you nothing he ain't telling you nothing because you missed the know it all you miss know it all he ain't going to tell you nothing but that woman was such a humble heart humble spirit that Jesus told her all things not only he he didn't tell everybody that but he told her woman you know you you you you know your Bible you may not be going to church but you know your Bible and you know what you're supposed to be looking and expecting all of them expecting but I didn't even he didn't tell them he told her his disciples didn't even know his discip he ask his discip who the men say I the son of man am and they said do John the Baptist El Jeremiah one of the prophets he said who do you say I am and Peter amen said th the Christ but Jesus told that woman I I'm Christ see what I'm saying because that woman had to write at it to even as disciples he didn't he say well I'm the Christ but that woman knew that what he would do the Messiah when he come he'll do this he'll tell us all things are you with me amen said when the Messiah come he'll tell us all things amen I'm glad amen that he came Matthew uh 27 and 11 when the Messiah come here tell us all things you know I'm excited about he would tell us all things she said I know when the Mah come he'll tell us all things and the woman ran through the street he she said come see a man that told me what all things that ever I've done amen come see a man that told me all things isn't he the Christ that's what she said is not he the Christ can you see a woman running through the street say isn't he the Christ a woman that had five husband and the sacking with somebody but yet she was testifying this man told me all things she said I know that when he come the Messiah come here tell us all things and she went and told everybody in the city come see a man that told me all things ever I've done are you with me I tell you when you meet up with Jesus again in the form of the Holy Ghost he'll tell you all things whatever you done praise God he'll reach down into the tents of your heart he knows I'm a secret place and he'll reveal the secrets of your heart he'll tell you where you stand and what you need he'll tell you all things but what you going to do with this Jesus who called Christ sometime we look look at him and we said when he's doing these things and the Bible they said he cast out devils in bzo he's the prince of devils he's this he ain't no prophet he not no Messiah are you with me I'm going to church I got God I know God oh Lord but the woman said he told me all things God is trying to penetrate some Spirits penetrate our heart and trying to give us something to recognize that Elijah has come the voice uh Midnight Cry voice has come in our day to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers back to the word amen but yet the people look at him and say who is this I don't know who this is that was the voice some one crying in the wilderness getting you ready for the Lord are you with me God is getting us ready for for the Rapture brother and sister the message of the hour to get us ready the raptured out of here yet we don't want to believe behold I sent my messenger he did it to the Jews what about you and I as Gentile bride could God wouldn't God do for us what he did for them but what kind of attitude should we have H I don't know they said to him how said then that the stries that El must first come see sometimes people are looking for Elijah to come that's that's what the scribe say how did they say El must first come and restore all things he said he come already and you did to him whatsoever you listed you killed them he come and you killed them and you God promis for the word for the day you live in he comes and they do the same thing they make his word of n effect by crucifying him the second time Amen brother and sisters you cannot you receive this word as God Amen has said to you Amen to get you ready for you to repent not to just stand by and judge it but to repent and get ready to meet the bridegroom amen it's repenting time a ain't time for you to evaluate it's time for you to repent amen I didn't come he didn't come to tell you Amen to evaluate or or try to figure it out until you can understand it he said repent but something got to be in your heart that cause you I want to repent God God I no this is you speaking to me I know it's God if God don't reveal himself to you I can't help you either amen I don't know a preacher that can help you except God come down and humble your heart and reveal himself to you as an individual same thing that saved you the same thing that going to keep you saved amen the same God that reveals himself to make you amen a Christian and make you want to live right it's the same God that's going to take you on to Perfection if you will continue to hear his voice are you with me but when you shut him off don't think he ain't going to take you no further he'll let you stay where you satisfied you'll stay right there he going he not obligated to you are you with me he's not obligated when you don't want to go no farther he'll let you stay right there that's all that's all I all I want all I I got it everything I need that's what that's all that's where you leave you're right there but there's are those that Lord I want more I want more I want more I want I everything you got Lord I want am me I know it's more of God I know it's a deep call to the deep I know there's a double portion for me I know that there's more of God and I want more Hallelujah that's got to be your a repentant heart that got to be somebody that's sincere about their Journey that can't be the one stuck up with the attitude problems amen don't even want the little that they got they're making a mess of that praise God the little God that they got they making a mess of it praise God grieving God to his Spirit grieving God Amen trying to love on their own you know I that phony love I see people so many Christian got phony love it ain't real it ain't real they can treat people nasty cold mean and have a bad attitude towards people and yet they got the love of God that ain't no love I don't care how bad a person treat you you ought to love them and treat them nice are you with me you ought to be just more concerned about them you than you concerned about your own self are you I told him up in uh I said Kentucky but we were in Indiana Brother Brad I said we build walls around us and we're trying to protect ourself I said you got to take take down those walls and Shake somebody hand that you don't feel I ain't shaking their hand cuz I know it's they ain't got no love if you got love shake their hand anyhow I don't want nothing to do with them cuz I I I know they ain't right shake their hand maybe some of the love that you got a rub off on them are you with me God is good I gotta close with this uh Matthew 2711 and Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying are thou the king of the Jews Jesus said unto him thou say re go ahead and when he had accused when he was accused of the chief priest and the elders he answer what see he told that woman something I'm tell tell you something let let me tell you something let let me tell you something I got to watchh my

all you ain't gonna believe nothing you see what the attitude that Jesus had I ain't telling y'all nothing but with that woman with that humble heart he told her y'all see what I'm saying y'all said well God didn't give you that message this morning I believe God told me cuz I wouldn't know how to tell y'all the these things like this I just praying what God what what what you want me to tell him
