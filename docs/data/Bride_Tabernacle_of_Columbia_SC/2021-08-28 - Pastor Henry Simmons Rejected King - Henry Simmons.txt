everyone who appreciate the songs appreciate the worship this night appreciate you all everyone that pressure we are and those that are listening we just appreciate you in jesus christ's name let us stand and read the word and go into prayer i want you to continue to pray for the saints over in haiti so the earthquake hit them pretty hard over there and we want to show you some some of the devastation that happened over there and hopefully we'll try to get with the trustees and see what we can do to help them and if you want to donate be sure to get with the trustees concerning the saints in haiti let us just well father in jesus name we thank you for the grace and mercy of god we thank you for the word we thank you for the love and kindness and tender mercy father father we ask you o god not only to look upon the saints in haiti but those of in afghanistan and the different things that are happening all over the world lord i just pray god that you'll be with your children lord and watch over your children everywhere father lord i pray god that you will meet the needs of those that are listening in and those that are here tonight lord god that you would speak to every need speak to every heart for certain of god you know our needs you know what oh where we stand and what we stand in need of i pray god that you're granted in jesus christ's name amen first samuel the eighth chapter first samuel eighth chapter as we stand we're gonna do seven verses i'll read the first you read the next and we'll read the seventh verse together and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sons judge or he made his son judges over israel too his sons and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after loot and took bribes and perverted judgment for and said unto him behold thou o and our sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us lack all the nations 6. together the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them may god bless you to work you may be seated tonight we want to talk to you concerning rejected king when the king is rejected amen now this could go from a lot of different angles and hopefully we just share a few different uh angers the king now if we notice mike in that seventh verse he says to samuel you know the lord said unto samuel hawking unto the voice of the people and and he said in what all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee you know a lot of times two wrongs don't make a right you know what samuel sons was doing was not right but what they were asking for and asking for a king that was not right so two wrong don't make a right because they saw the condition of samuel's sons and what they were doing and they pointed out you know their what they were doing to samuel and then so what they said well because this is happening this is what we want it's easy to see what's happening around you and you can see somebody doing something wrong you know people take the attitude or if they're doing it i could do it too you know and that's what folks do that gets discouraged because somebody else is doing wrong but remember you have an individual walk you must know god for yourself you just can't be following the crowd just say well i'm going to take things in my own hand you know what i'm saying i because you know we might we might find fault in this and fought in that but let us look at ourselves and whether or not let's see what god is saying to you as an individual see because you're going to be responsible for what god is saying now what they did they respected their king though they didn't have a king like the other nations mind you they did not have a king like the other nations all the other nations had a king but they had a prophet european and they had a king they had a king that ruled over them but they did not see that king in the physical realm neither do you and i in the physical realm see amen god but there's a god that rules over the church there's a king that rules over the church because remember he said the kingdom of heaven is at hand then if we're in the kingdom of god then we must have a king to rule are you with me as god served and said that you are the kingdom he is the king are you with me so you got to recognize that the king rules over the kingdom and you are the kingdom and he is the king are you with me so though i mean let's not you know sometimes look at the as they were doing they were looking at the physical kingdom of the world and they was looking out there and they saw all the nations had them a figure a visible head and it to them they must have admired it looked good i think we should have something of that magnitude so we want what the rest of the nations have now remember uh let's just go to first john here for a moment that we might rejected king he said they then samuel they didn't reject you but they rejected me oftentimes uh i i i hope before we get to that we will recognize that there is a king there is a king that's here he's invisible to most folks but to you and i he's real and we see him whom our soul love it amen and we have headship here praise god we have one that rules and have the authority over his kingdom are you with me and we must honor and respect the king to disrespect our king though he's invisible to the natural man but to the spiritual man he is here present for when two or three are gathered in my name i'm here he promised to be in our midst praise god and he's watching over his kingdom his eyes go to and fro through the earth all things are naked and open before the eyes of him and whom we have to do are you with me the king is here let's honor the king now this kingdom was not as egypt it was not as uh babylon it was not like the other kingdoms of the world but this kingdom that god special people when he called an exodus out of egypt he met and he said you are a peculiar people amen you are a holy nation amen so i i made you special you're not like the rest i call you out the church today is called the call out so we've come on an exodus not out of egypt the natural but we have come out on a spiritual exodus out of mystery babylon the great and coming out of mystery of babylon god took us to a place not a natural land but into christ himself are you with me so you and i have journeyed it okay let let me just go here uh first john 2 and 15. god calls us not only out of the spiritual see there are nations that we came out of we came out of denomination are you with me they came out of egypt they came out of natural nations physical countries they came out of that are you with me we've come out of the different denominations of the world we god called us on a spiritual exodus to come out of them and revelation 18 said come out of her my people and we heard the voice that cried to the people of god with the spiritual echo that echoed to those that god amen and it sounds like the voice of god calling his sheep out are you with me so we just didn't come to uh to a mountain that about sinai but we come to mount zion we come to a kingdom that cannot be moved we come to the church of the living god the church of the firstborn amen the pill and ground of the truth amen that's what we come to on a spiritual so we have a king that's leading us we have a king that's leading us out praise god i hope excuse me i said first john 2. yeah it says here love not the world we know that satan is the prince in the power of the air and satan is their king apollyon cake satan is their king the king that rules this world he said to jesus all this how will i give you show them all the kingdoms of the world say all this what i give you if you bow down and worship me are you look man see and you know what satan will give you the squirrel and his goods but are you with me but he wants worship are you with me see people worshiping in an invisible devil they're they're worshiping demons and devils without consciously physically knowing that they are also or have a king and his name is satan lucifer or whatever are you with me so these kingdoms these kings are at war the flesh walls against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh are you with me praise god and remember i said you are the kingdom and the devil is trying to overthrow your the kingdom isn't that right remember he said the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the what in the holy ghost are you with me so the devil would like the thief cometh not but to kill the steal and what destroyed amen but he said i come that you might have what let you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly amen so god amen you're in a kingdom that cannot be moved the joy you have the world didn't give it in the world are you with me so oh brother says listen he says love not the world neither the things that are in the world the things that are in the world they're temporal they're only going to last for a little season but the things that are not seen they are eternal are you with me so you by faith see the unseen as moses saw him who is invisible amen that's why he forsook egypt because he saw the invisible god how can he see the invisible god by faith amen amen praise god faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen but yet by faith we see for we walk by faith not by sight are you with me so we're on a journey of spiritual exodus praise god in this third exodus amen we're going somewhere amen we're entering into that realm of that cycle of a wretched faith are you looking the world don't know that we're moving praise god we're moving at such a high speed praise god hallelujah one day that light that amen they might call it a ufo whatever praise god one day that light came in praise god we'll just drop down and pick you up praise god you'll be changed in the moment of the tweaking of an eye praise god hallelujah oh amen i thank god for the sisters she said to my i hear my thief in the call calling me come up a little higher until god pay love amen i hear it calling me come on up come up here praise god because he after the church ages was over he he said come on up here amen god calling you to a higher place oh god i just got started and want to stop say here we are he says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man what love the world the love of the father is what you know no matter how beautiful things look now god says don't love it you only your love is for god i love god amen god is love amen you must fall in love with god and you i mean your love must be single not to another amen the love of god amen i love god i'm in love with god so if i'm in love with god i don't love this world praise god there's many things in the world you can fall in love with that you wouldn't want to give up or lose amen but when you got god you got everything you need everything you need when you got the lord when you have the lord are you with me praise god so he says these are the things that are in the world now if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him praise god you wonder why people do certain things because they love the world and if they do the love of god the father not in him simply you cannot love you cannot serve two masters you hate the one and love the other so if you're in love with the world you it's you become an enemy of god are you with me enmity with god okay he says the love of the father is not in him now you might say what are you talking about so he breaks it down he says for all that is in the world is what the lust of the flesh you know sometimes we get in trouble because we spend all of our attention and all of our money you're never satisfied sometimes you know i got to get a new outfit every time i get a paycheck i got to get a better call better house better this better that better the devil will run you crazy if you follow him up you can't even that flesh will never get satisfied you know so he says all that's in the world is the lust of the flesh this flesh cry out talking about it has needs yeah it has needed need of god come on but my god shall supply what according to his what so what god has for you is greater riches than that which is in egypt that's that then that that's in the world and moses recognized that god had greater riches than it would than those that were in egypt are you with me so brother and sister you got to recognize god got greater he got more for you he got more to offer you the devil might have certain things he can offer you but you got to recognize it's going to last just a little while temporary pledging it's only for a season well what god offers you is eternal okay it says for all that is in the world lust of the flesh and the lust of the what ah it's what we see we want did you see it yeah i see i'm gonna get me one of those get one of these one of those one of these oh lord sometimes we have to settle down settle down just settle ourselves down and say god just what just leave me guide me sometimes we have to not only are we fasting for the tent and praying for the tent meeting but we need to fast from stuff just stuff just fast i i'm not gonna do this no more you know just let me fast from that because i don't want nothing to be my god you know what i'm saying and so i have to kill you know the bible said we die daily so some things you have to crucify something you got to make sure that that thing is not ruling over you that's not your king doesn't that's not what you're worshiping are you with me see because if you put anything before god amen then that's that becomes your king and he rules over you are you with me so you don't want anything in this world to rule over you amen you have one king and that's king jesus are you with me and he rules in his kingdom amen my life is not my own he says and the pride of this life is not of the father but of the world the world passed away and the lust thereof but he that does the will of what hollow abided how long see that's what you got to uh be set with inside of your spirit and in your heart and in your mind that i'm going to be settled i'm going to be set praise god my eyes got to be single i got to know amen whom i believe and i got to be persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day you got to be fully persuaded that god amen oh lord oh he rules praise god you can tell who's ruling amen yo yo the very manifestation of your acts and how you uh uh conduct your lives shows who [Music] who rules amen so i'm i'm gonna have to cut it short because i might make it a series but let me just do this go to uh maybe you i don't know how i'm gonna do it i want to talk about the marriage of the lamb a little bit and and talking about the marriage of the lamb revelation um 10th chapter 19th chapter maybe i'll finish sunday morning but let me just try to get you some highlights here the marriage of the lamb and it says his wife has made her separating are you with me the marriage of the lamb it's very important to recognize when we talk about the king and we talk about the one that has ruled headship amen you know when he's when that sin happened in the garden he said to eve your desire shall be to your husband he shall what rule rule over you so we talking about the marriage of the lamb and the bible said his wife has made herself ready isn't that right so the husband should be the head and over the wife isn't that right so eve headship was adam are you with me but we've spiritualized everything and we've took taken the bible and made it with none effect so we got all kind of stuff going on in the church just today because we we we've taken and perverted the gospel and twisted it all up till there's no hatship no more instead of the parents being headship over the children the children got more rights than the parents everything is turned upside down are you with me so if we're living in a world that made almost the bible obsolete maybe it don't don't mean nothing because they folks go to church and they disregard the bible they made the bible of none effect there they crucified him where there jerusalem most holy city there where in the church amen he came into his own in his own way his own people amen so right in the midst there they who his own people they there they the the one that they said he's not our king crucified they rejected the king they said he he won't rule over us in other words you're not going to tell me what to do i'm going to tell you he's still king and i'm going to tell you he he's still here right here christ is revealed in his own word are you with me he's still king pray i'll tell you i i did a track when i was a young preacher about 40 years ago and i said you buy now about leader are you with me i said i'd rather bow every knee should bow and every tongue is going to confess to jesus christ is lord are you with me we can either do it now later but every knee shall bow amen so revelation uh 1919 only reason i'm going here because i i want to deal with the rejected king and i and i want you to see um you and i have a relationship with we we have received our king amen and in that in that we receive the king it identifies us as his kingdom and as we have received the king we know who he is we recognize him there they didn't recognize who he was so they rejected him and they didn't want him to rule over them because amen they were already preoccupied they were already saying i'm a pharisees if you're going to come and rule are you going to come and tell us what to do then you got to go to school and be like uh a chaotis and and go through like uh saul of tasha's paul you got to go identify yourself because you don't have an authority except you got letters from the high priest are you a pen and and you see they they they they have gone and they've structured themselves so today and jesus even in this age he talks about on the outside of the church he's been rejected in the church and then lay out a seal the bible says he was knocking on the door what he was knocking on the door to church that means he's on the outside amen you know sometimes if jesus wanted to walk in and say something he had to wait on protocol the spirit just couldn't move are you with me because they got it so structured that they they're almost organizing and got it so structured to jesus had been he's out of the picture are you with me so uh so uh the people of god you will be out of the picture you're not you're oddballs you you he's despised and rejected the men a man of sorrow acquainted with greed and we hid as it were our faces oh you look man so if the if they did it in the green tree he said they'll do it also in the dry if they did it to jesus they're going to do it the same thing to you are you with me now if they don't do it to you then something is wrong with you amen but we want to be accepted we want to be like the rest of the nations you know are you with me so we we are looking at them and we almost you know we are mine them amen but the one we ought to have our eyes focus on is the king but how can you see the king when he's disguised he's hidden in his own word amen but yet he comes amen for he says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life for they are there to testify of me praise god amen now they were looking for him the messiah but the woman at the well recognized who he was he i know when the messiah come she might have had five husbands the one that she was living with wasn't her but she recognized because she amen was amen the the one that amen oh i'll show you the bride the lamb's wife amen are you with me it comes down to identification you can see what others don't see with all their uh spirituality with all their uh knowledge and all his schooling yet they cannot see god reveal in his own word coming according to what the scripture said here come just oh oh hallelujah they were so intent on getting rid of john and when jesus come they were even more intent amen so jesus said which other prophets did not your father's kill amen so how are you going to receive jesus they always did that brother and sister throughout all when it comes down to the word the word was always looked at as being something out of date are you with me uh something that's not for us it's something that was or something that's gonna be but never recognized when it's identified now when it becomes present tense they can't they talk about a god that wants in a god that is to be but the god that is jesus said go tell them that i am sent you and he said before abraham i mean was i am i believe that he is right now the same i am is in the midst the same one are you with me but we amen as they did not recognize him neither they meant the world today recognize that he is living and he's real right now amen and on this he's still here he's still the king and he's still rules amen not by force but whosoever will ain't that praise god when we can yield ourselves and when we can get ourselves out to wait when we can say lord i love you not my will but let your will be done praise god lord oh hallelujah that's what we got to release and let our faith be anchored in the word okay so it says let us uh uh 19 7. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made what praise god remember five wives five foolish all virgins all clean living people but five wives five foolish but he said they never already had all amen see without the baptism of the holy ghost without all in our vessel without the baptism of the holy ghost not only did they have all but they had extra oil david said my cup run is over surely goodness and mercy he that believed on me as the scripture said that out of his belly shall flow what rivers of living water just more than no he's more than enough hallelujah he's got everything he's he gives us more than enough praise god but we got to have that extra praise god we just can't be satisfied just enough i i just want to just enough god to say i'm i'm saved i just want just enough to say that i'm a christian i want just enough that's the if i can just barely make it oh folks amen let's not amen just barely get in let's let's go deep amen praise god let's just launch into the deep enemy and let down your net come on somebody praise god you find you've been tall in all the all your life long but oh watch out in the deep and amen they said lord we done tall all the night and you said you know i'm gonna tell you something no matter how hard we try when when when jesus steps on the scene he knows where the fish are if there's no fish there he's he's going to create something just let down your net and watch watch god move praise god because he when he speaks here oh he'll do and god is good amen i'll tell you what i'm to do i'm going to skip because of the king that i want you to to see and the one that i want you to recognize tonight in verse 13 he says and he was clothed with the vester dipped in blood and his name is called the what the word of god this is the king that people fail to recognize it's not what the preachers say it's not what the church say it's not what the denominations say this name is called he's the king amen he's the one that we must crown praise god he's the one that we must recognize the word of god man should not live by bread alone but by what every word that proceeded out of what ma for god it's the word amen you must anchor your faith in the word are you with me and brother and sister until you're anchored in the word brothers that's what we miss out okay i had instead of trying to bring it all together i want you to recognize that the king that's been rejected today is the word of god people have rejected the word and they have creeds they got dogmas they got all kind of things that they actually think is all right but he said don't add to the word don't take away from the word are you with me but people can add a little here to satisfy this crowd and take away a lot of that that's what it takes to you know to have a couple thousand and you know let's just do it amen let's just do anything instead of coming to worship the lord let's just entertain the people just to make everything exciting let's just do all kind of stuff amen and when you got a good show going on everybody wants to come to see the show are you with me but we ought to come to worship god i want the word amen i want god i want to see god i want to see god praise god i want to see god do what he did yesterday i want to see him amen if he's here today then do the things that he did hallelujah same power same anointing same god amen praise god still moving moving by spirit that knows the secrets of our hearts that can tell us what we're going through where we've been and what oh the same word the word of god is quick powerful any two as a sword it can discern the thoughts even the intents of the heart god knows and he'll meet you praise god is that another king in your life is there another king are you bothering down do you want a king like they did they cried out give us a king like the other nations i want one like them or have you fallen in love with uh the king of other nations that you want one just like them you know god what god did he says samuel i want you to listen to what they're saying all that they say you don't let them have it because they don't know that they rejected me from reigning over them amen you know sometimes we'll put the holy ghost out the church we'll put we'll put the holy ghost out in the church and we'll put the holy ghost out of our lives are you what man you can easily allow the holy ghost to be put out amen when the word come to you amen and you reject the word then you're telling god there's no room in the end praise god when he comes to you as an individual speak to you and you can let him be lord of your life you can let him rule you can let him abide or you can tell him no thank brother you sister that's up to you that's your choice that you make the decision you make you can let the word praise god because i'm gonna show you amen he says the lamb's wife has made her self-ready and that's what it's all about so the word of god i'm not going to read the rest of it right now if i sometimes i said i'll finish sunday and i'm going to something else but i'll try the lord's willing but god is good everybody all right you know when i was going through this i said i i thought i'll let you let folks open it up to y'all talking again like i'm teaching sunday school but by the grace of god i i love you i appreciate you coming let us stand i'm glad for sister matt glad to have you tonight praise god let's buy his father in jesus name what a wonder you are lord we love you tonight lord i just searched
