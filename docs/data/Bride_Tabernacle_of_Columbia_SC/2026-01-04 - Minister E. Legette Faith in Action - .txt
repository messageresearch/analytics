Oh God, to give your name praise, Lord, and thanks for all your goodness and your grace. Lord, I thank you, Lord, for blessing us to be here today, Lord. And, oh God, to be able to sing praises and to worship your name, Lord. God, I pray Lord that if we said or done anything that ain't like you and if it would hinder the move of God this morning, Lord, I pray that you would forgive us and Lord that you would help us Lord to be reconciled to you and oh God to get out of the way Lord that you might have your way this morning [music] God I pray that you'd bless the ministers of the gospel Lord as they go forth Lord all over the land oh God surely Lord Lord we need a word from you God we need something that will sustain us in the hour that we live in seeing that these are treacherous times and but oh God I believe that your grace is sufficient for us and I pray that you continue to move, continue to bless God, save, heal and deliver by the power of the Holy Ghost. Bless Lord those that need to bless Lord and touch Lord that need to be touched Lord. Thank you Lord for we love you and we appreciate you. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Let the church say amen. Amen. [music] Amen. We want to look at the book of Hebrews by the grace of God. Hebrews 11. Feel all right this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11 and we'll begin at the first verse. Very familiar scripture. We want to talk about faith and action this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith in action. Hebrews 11. We'll begin here at the first verse. If you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it reads, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of the things which do appear." By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous. God testifying of his gifts. By it he being dead yet speaketh. By faith, Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him before he was trans for his translation. He had a testimony that pleased God. But without faith, it's impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of him that diligently seek him. You may be seated. I'm going read down a little further. I like how it says that you know uh through for by you know faith it says here in the second verse the elders obtain their good report. Amen. &gt;&gt; So faith doesn't give out bad reports. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith only going to give you a good report. Right? &gt;&gt; Everything else your all other five senses might give you a bad report but faith is going to give you a good report. &gt;&gt; When everybody everything else is saying it's all bad, faith going to say it's all well. Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; And you might look at it and say, "Well, how is it all well? Look at this." But faith saying all is well. Calm down. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's got it all under control. Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's and that's where we at right now. It says, you know, uh even the other night I was laying on the couch and I'll say it again that you know I was saying and something says to me, you know, look at all these mountains in the way, right? But at the same time, something believe said to me and I believe those faith said the this ain't a mountain. this a test. Hallelujah. And I says, I'm going to pass this test. I said, so many tests was put before people. I says, what it is, we got to understand that what the devil does a lot of times, he plays mind games with people, don't he? &gt;&gt; Because remember when Jesus rules, he said, "All power is given unto me." Right? &gt;&gt; So if he has all power, then how much does the devil have? &gt;&gt; The devil don't have none, does he? So when he's talking about what control he's got over you, he's only got the control that you give over him. Right? But I said, I ain't giving the devil no control. I'm taking it back. Hallelujah. I ain't letting them have control over my home. I'm taking my home back. I'm taking my children back. I'm taking my job back, my finance, whatever it is. Come on. God has given us the victory. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Come on. And one thing about God, it don't God time ain't nothing to God, is it? &gt;&gt; When God promise you something, it don't matter how long it is. God's word is still true. Right? When it left his mouth, it ain't going to return to him without accomplishing that which he sent it to do. Hallelujah. So, I believe what God says. Hallelujah. No matter how long it takes, I say, "God, I believe what you said." Hallelujah. And I got faith to wait on it. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many feel like waiting this morning? &gt;&gt; God is good, ain't he? &gt;&gt; Faith in action. Come on. Says, "By faith, Enoch was translated." And it says that he should not see death and was not found because God translated him before his translation. It says he had a testimony. Come on. How many got a testimony this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. But his testimony did what? His testimony pleased God, didn't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. We talking about faith and action. Some people say, "I got faith, but they walk around and can't hardly get around." Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. But faith in action. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pain bothering you getting around anyway, ain't you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Somebody say, "You look like you barely making." And you say, "No, but every step I take, I'm moving by the power of God." Hallelujah. Come on. Every mo every foot my foot uh steps mean possessions, right? So, I might have been fighting, but since I made that step, I'm possessing that ground. Hallelujah. And when I possess that ground, I ain't giving nothing back to the devil. Hallelujah. God didn't give you victory for you to give it back to the devil, did he? Come on. But he said it's yours. Hallelujah. And if it's mine, GOD SAID IT'S MINE. IT'S MINE. I don't care what the devil say. Hallelujah. How many believe that this morning? Come on. That's where I I feel like. Come on. I feel like taking mountains. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel like Caleb. He said I was I was so many years ago when God promised me this mountain, right? Because I stood before him and I was faithful. And it don't matter how many years ago that been, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. I think he said I was 40 that was 45 years ago or so. He says, you know, come on. And I can tell his testimony for him this morning. Hallelujah. He said, "Because I've been through a lot back then, right? We've been through A LOT OF BATTLES AND STORMS since then, right?" Hallelujah. I got more scars than I had back then, right? MIGHT BE A LITTLE OLDER than I was back then, but nevertheless, THE PROMISE OF GOD STANDS ASSURE. HALLELUJAH. GOD PROMISED IT TO ME AND I STILL WANT IT. HALLELUJAH. OH, JESUS. GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN. GIVE ME MY BLESSINGS. GIVE ME WHAT GOD [screaming] PROMISED ME. COME ON. HALLELUJAH. Y'all feel all right this morning? Come on. Before he left here, Enoch had a testimony that did what? Please God, right? Come on. How many want to be pleasing in God's sight? &gt;&gt; Come on. God ain't going to just take you on without a testimony that's pleasing to him. Right. Come on. West going to be pleasing to God when you willing to do his will. Right. Come on. When you LEARN TO SAY, "GOD, NOT MY WILL, but thy will." Hallelujah. When you learn that everything that you look at it, come on, it's only temporary. Here today and gone tomorrow. Hallelujah. When you learn to seek after the things that'll last. Hallelujah. And what'll last? The things that you do for God will last. Hallelujah. Come on. MAN WILL FORGET WHAT YOU DO ABOUT HIM. BUT GOD WON'T FORGET. HALLELUJAH. HE WON'T FORGET YOUR LABOR. HE WON'T FORGET THE NIGHTS YOU CRIED. HE WON'T FORGET THE NIGHTS YOU STAYED IN PRAYER AND STOOD IN THE GAP. GOD WON'T FORGET [screaming] THAT NOW. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all of my heart. Hallelujah. He had a testimony that pleased God. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says without faith, right? Come on, somebody say without faith. &gt;&gt; Without faith. &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU NEED FAITH, DON'T YOU? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need faith this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to believe at some point, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT? I say it's one thing, a sense of faith won't fail you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Won't fail you. Right? Faith to bring the impossible and make it possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it says that the world by faith, we believe that uh the world was created by the word of God, right? &gt;&gt; I like saying that all the time. I say that everything we see is a product of the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. We believe that everything we see, come on, is at one point it was spoken, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's how it appeared. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT? THAT'S HOW MUCH THAT'S HOW POWERFUL THE word of God is. THAT WHEN GOD SPEAKS, IT DON'T SAY, "HE, I spoke and it didn't happen." NO. WHEN GOD SPEAKS, it happens, don't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. WHEN HE SPEAKS SOMETHING, IT'S GOT TO BE JUST WHAT HE SAID. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. EVERYTHING WE SEE IS A PRODUCT OF THE SPOKEN WORD. HALLELUJAH. He said, "LET THERE BE AND THERE WAS." RIGHT? &gt;&gt; COME ON. I LIKE THAT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD IS TRYING TO GET US TO THAT FAITH. COME ON. HE SAYS THAT HE TELL DISCIPLES ONCE. HE SAYS, "WHY ARE YOU DOUBTING?" HE SAYS IF YOU WOULD ONLY BELIEVE, RIGHT? HE SAID IT'LL BE AS YOU SAY, RIGHT? COME ON. GOD PUT THAT SAME WORD IN YOUR MOUTH THAT WHEN YOU SPEAK, HALLELUJAH. THINGS WILL BEGIN TO CREATE. HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU GOT TO ONLY WHAT? BELIEVE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH JESUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come on. I like screaming. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. Something happens, don't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. Something about, you know, I was thinking about speaking, right? I says, "We got to start speaking, don't we?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. The other night we was was I would say we was joking around, but I'm being serious. Brother Gordon, I said, "We speaking things into existence this year." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "What you want?" He said, "I want to be home, brother." &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, you going to be home?" I told Caleb, I said, "Since you going to start calling the date, what's the date?" He going to be home. [laughter] Come on. CALL IT OUT. HALLELUJAH. And we going TO SPEAK IT, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; COME ON. DO Y'ALL BELIEVE THAT? COME ON. DO Y'ALL BELIEVE WE WE SERVE A GOD THAT POWERFUL? COME ON. HALLELUJAH. THAT WHEN YOU SPEAK, MOUNTAINS ARE MOVED. COME ON. SITUATIONS ARE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; COME ON. I BELIEVE THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

A gentile, right? People that had them in captive, but when he did when he had he he got in desperation one day, right? He had somebody in his house that he loved. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that person was going through maybe at the point of death, but he loved them. Hallelujah. He loved him enough to go to the one that he ain't even look like he had no right to go to, right? Oh Jesus, how humble he had TO GET TO PRESS his way through, right? To go to the the ONE THAT WE GOT CAPTIVE BECAUSE WHAT HE SAW IN HIM, AUTHORITY in him, RIGHT? HE SAW IN JESUS THERE WAS POWER IN JESUS. &gt;&gt; COME ON. And that's the SAME THING TODAY. YOU GOT TO REALIZE [screaming] THERE'S POWER IN THE NAME OF JESUS. COME ON. YOU GOT TO REALIZE THAT THE BLOOD NEVER LOST HIS POWER. HALLELUJAH. DO YOU GOT A NEED? PRESS YOUR WAY THROUGH. HALLELUJAH.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. That centurion went to Jesus, didn't he? &gt;&gt; I like how he began to say, "Come on.

But he began to say, "Hey, Jesus." Hallelujah. Come on. He says, "I got a servant. I got one in my house." Hallelujah. He's sick towards death. I know what we're doing, y'all people. I'm just paraphrasing, right? I know how we got y'all in Cal, but I got a need. And I know that you're the only one that can meet that need. Hallelujah. Money can't meet that need. Hallelujah. Nobody else can't meet that need but you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus looked at him and said, "Come on, I'll go to your house." Hallelujah. But it was something about his faith. Hallelujah. It was in action, wasn't it? He says that I SEE SOMETHING IN YOU THAT [screaming] I DON'T SEE IN NOBODY ELSE. HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T EVEN GOT TO COME TO MY HOUSE. HALLELUJAH.

SOMEBODY SAID, "I GOT FAITH, BUT FAITH WITHOUT WORKS is dead, ain't it?" &gt;&gt; Come on. I GOT FAITH, BUT I AIN'T doing nothing. Come on. Oh, you got to have faith. AND YOU GOT TO MOVE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Come on. Move it. And that's what we was reading here. I know we want to get them all, but looking here at at through the scriptures, I said what it was. The these warriors are what we call heroes of faith, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their faith was in action, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. They didn't just say, "Oh, I believe." And not do nothing about it, but they believed and they begin to move, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. One thing about Abraham, I was looking at him. I says, "You know who God called Abraham. All he heard was a voice, right? &gt;&gt; And his voice told him to get out, right?" &gt;&gt; Amen. and I'mma make of you a great nation. Right? &gt;&gt; His his uh uh uh uh uh way of thinking right from the beginning, him already being old. Sometimes we look at and dried up. If he would have looked at his at his own uh uh body or whatever right from the beginning, then he might have said, "I ain't going to go." Right? But what did faith tell him? Hallelujah. He had a belief. He wanted something from God, didn't he? Come on. And did he receive it? Yes, he received it. But what did he have to do? HE HAD TO GET UP AND MOVE, DIDN'T HE? &gt;&gt; Come on. But even though he got up and moved, it was trial after trial, right? Situation after situation. Hallelujah. But still yet, faith had a move, didn't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. And when he moved, God did something, didn't he? GOD CAME ON the scene. And that's what it is today. Come on. God wants you to move. God is not a liar. Come on. He's not a man that he should lie, but he'll do everything his word said he'll do. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. But you got to have faith to do what? Believe. And your faith, what it was, your faith to make you move, right? Your faith to make YOU GET UP AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. HALLELUJAH. TAKE BACK WHAT THE DEVIL STOLE from you. COME ON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK AROUND SAD and weary and in doubt all the time worrying about this and WORRYING ABOUT THAT. COME ON. THE DEVIL PUT THOSE THINGS ON YOU, RIGHT? THROUGH THE FIVE SENSES, BUT THE SENSE OF FAITH ONLY HAS A GOOD REPORT. HALLELUJAH. BILLS ARE DUE. COME ON. CHILDREN GONE OUT. COME ON. BODY IS IN PAIN. BUT NEVERTHELESS, [screaming] I GOT A GOOD REPORT. HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE HE SAID HE'LL SUPPLY ALL OF MY NEEDS ACCORDING TO HIS RICHES AND GLORY. WHY? BECAUSE HE SAID, "I'M THE LORD THY [screaming] GOD THAT HEALTHTH THEE." COME ON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO PRAISE GOD FOR THAT THIS MORNING. KNOWING [screaming] THAT GOD CAN DO ALL THINGS, CAN'T HE? &gt;&gt; Come on. We're talking about faith in action. Hallelujah. Come on. One thing, you know, I I was I was thinking about so many testimonies. Hallelujah. of what God done. I remember, you know, it wasn't long ago and my leg, my left leg was bothering me so bad. I I got the little knot still, some of the little knot is still there on my leg, but I couldn't even bend down hardly. And every time I bend down, it was in so much pain. This was a little while ago. And I I was going through and I went to the doctor and they look at my legs and first they were telling me at one point, you got fluid in your legs, right? Then they said it was arthritis [laughter] at 42 years old. Arthritis in your bone, the shins, right? Got got the problems with your knees and and I was getting to pray and I said, "Lord, thing hurt so bad sometimes I couldn't even bend down." But I remember one night, hallelujah, I came to service and uh brother Simmons in the back before I come out, I think must have had to preach that night. I said, "Brother Simmons," I said, "Could you lay hands on this leg for me?" Right? So he reached out and when he laid his hands on that leg. Hallelujah. He prayed for my leg back there in the back office. When I come out and I sat down on the front pew, all of a sudden I felt something tightening around my leg like somebody putting an ace band or something real tight around my leg. So I'm thinking what in the world going on, right? But don't you know from that service even until now that was I don't know how many months ago brother Sim could testify. I don't know how many months ago I ain't had not one pain in that leg since. Come on. And I've been walking and praising God. Now the little the little bumper n is still there. They could have called it off riders or whatever there was. It don't matter what it was, but I know one thing. Faith took it away. Hallelujah. What was it? Was faith in action. He said you you lay hands on the sick. Hallelujah. And you shall recover. He laid that hand on it. I AIN'T HAD A PAIN SINCE. HALLELUJAH. WHAT IT WAS FAITH. HALLELUJAH. IN ACTION. &gt;&gt; COME ON. GOD trying to show us something. Ain't he? I remember another time, this is years ago, I had some stomach pains. Come on. I'm just trying to increase your faith this morning. Come on. Faith in action. Sometimes we have issues, but we don't tell nobody about them. Right? We don't want to say, "I don't want it." But what it is, you'll tell the doctor and everybody else about it, but what about the saints in prayer? Hallelujah. What about doing what the word of God says? But sometimes God will let you go on. Hallelujah. Because when all of that fell, don't you know God will still be right there? Hallelujah. And you'll find out sometimes it was easier for you to go to God and ask God about it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe that. Right. &gt;&gt; That woman with the issues, SHE SPENT ALL HER MONEY ALL those years, didn't she? Come on. MAYBE SHE WAS BROKE AT THE TIME. RIGHT. BUT THEN SHE HEARD JESUS WAS PASSING BY. RIGHT. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE CROWD WAS SICK. BUT WHAT SHE HAD TO DO WAS PRESS HER WAY THROUGH. HALLELUJAH. PRESS HER WAY THROUGH THE PAIN. PRESS HER WAY THROUGH THE DISCOURAGEMENT. PRESS HER WAY THROUGH EVERYBODY SAYING THAT THIS IS THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE. BUT SHE PRESSED HER WAY. HALLELUJAH. And all it took was TOUCHING JESUS. HALLELUJAH. OH JESUS. &gt;&gt; COME ON. TOUCH HIM. &gt;&gt; And you'll be all right. HALLELUJAH. BUT HER FAITH WAS [screaming] IN ACTION, WASN'T IT, &gt;&gt; to get through? Come on. I remember one night I says, you know, uh, one night I I come to church and, you know, uh, I know, uh, Charlotte, she can testify. I like having a witness. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; She can testify. One night I come home from work. I got off work early and my stomach was bottom. It had cramps in it so bad and all down in my legs and everywhere. I couldn't even stand up straight. I'm bent over and stomach was hurting so bad. Felt like something was pulling. I said, "Lord," and Charlotte was like, "You need to go to the doctor." I says, "You know, we had prayer service at night. It was on a Tuesday night." I says, "I'm going to go to prayer." And I said, you know, she said, "You need to go to the doctor." I said, "If the Lord don't heal me, [laughter] then I go to the doctor after church." But I believe that God was going to do something. Amen. So I pressed my way. I come in the building. I was bent over. And I remember brother Simmons had he said he said, "You all right?" I said, "No, I'm not all right. The stomach." So he prayed for me and I I got just enough just to get down on my knees and pray. And after we got done praying, my thing was still hurting me so bad. He says, "How you feeling, brother Ernest?" And then I said, "I still in pain." He said, "Everybody, I want everybody to come up to the church. Come up to the altar." So everybody come up to the altar that night. He said, "Brother Sam, I want you to pray." And he says, "Brother Gordon, lay your hands on his stomach." And as brother Sam laid his hands on my head, God is my witness for whom I stand. Soon as brother Gordon laid his hands on my stomach, the pain left before they even started praying. I started to start shouting right then. Hallelujah. But I said, I'mma let him go on through. The pain left. Soon as soon as he touched my stomach, the pain left. Hallelujah. And don't you know that pain ain't never came back. Hallelujah. What it was, God did his own operation. HALLELUJAH. GOD DID the healing, don't he? Didn't he? Come on. BUT WHAT IT WAS, FAITH IN ACTION. HALLELUJAH. Come on. What you got to do? YOU GOT TO BELIEVE IN GOD. HALLELUJAH. COME ON. FAITH IN ACTION AND WATCH WHAT GOD DO. HALLELUJAH. Somebody give God praise this morning. Come on. [applause] I said faith in action. Come on. I says, you know, sometimes what it is, you know, we got to we got to believe God, right? &gt;&gt; I said faith going to give you a good report, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. You look at sometimes we look at these heroes of faith and we say, "Oh, look at THE MIGHTY." BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. SOMETIMES WE DON'T look at the mountains they had to face, right? Or the trials they had to face. But one thing, their faith outweighed their trials, didn't it? &gt;&gt; Their faith was stronger, right? What was it? What was it? Their faith was stronger because God was stronger. Hallelujah. They was believing in a higher power than what had them bound. Come on. I said, YOU KNOW, YOU ONLY DEALING WITH THREE POWERS. That's the power of de. The devil. Hallelujah. The power of faith and the power of God, right? The power of devil going to work with these five senses, right? But the power of faith works beyond the five senses. Hallelujah. Beyond what you can see. When the power of faith steps in, DON'T YOU KNOW THE POWER OF GOD takes over. Hallelujah. And that's what we enjoy. Hallelujah. What was we look at these heroes of faith? Many of times the p the devil, he'll flex his power. He'll show you his power. Right? Come on. But you faith is something that you can't see. But even though you can't see it, it's real. It's now faith. Come on. It's a substance. It's something real. Hallelujah. It ain't something that you imagine in your mind, but it's something you can have, grab hold to. Hallelujah. It's an understanding that you got that the doctors don't got. It's an understanding you got, your husband don't got, your wife don't got. IT'S AN UNDERSTANDING. HALLELUJAH. THAT I BELIEVE [screaming] GOD WHEN NOBODY ELSE DON'T BELIEVE. HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE GOD SPOKE TO ME. HALLELUJAH. AND I BELIEVE WHAT GOD [screaming] SAID. OH JESUS. LET SARAH LAUGH. BUT YET I BELIEVE GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH JESUS. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; Sarah laughed, didn't she? &gt;&gt; But Abraham believed, didn't he? &gt;&gt; And God sent him a witness, didn't he? Melzdc met him and said, "Oh, Abraham, servant of the most high God." Hallelujah. Come on. I'M JUST HERE TO ENCOURAGE YOU. HALLELUJAH. THAT THE BATTLE YOU JUST WON, GOD WON THAT BATTLE FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH. GOD FOUGHT YOUR BATTLES. HALLELUJAH. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD IS GOING TO DO [screaming] WHAT HE SAID. HALLELUJAH. OH, JESUS. I can see Abraham saying, "Nobody believe ME, BUT I BELIEVED ANYHOW." [screaming] HALLELUJAH. I TRUSTED IN GOD ANYHOW. AND IT WAS ACCOUNTED TO him for righteousness, wasn't it? Come on. If I got to stand by myself. HALLELUJAH. I'LL STAND BY MYSELF. IF I GOT TO PRAISE BY MYSELF, I'LL [screaming] PRAISE BY MYSELF. HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE I MET GOD FOR MYSELF. OH, JESUS. I heard the voice. Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But what it was, I said, "The power of the devil works on these senses, don't it?" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, the other day I was riding down the road. I said, "One thing about these five senses, they got such a power over our life, don't they?" Come on. &gt;&gt; I'll tell y'all what I did. I was riding out the road the other day. I said, "I want to see how much we need our eyes. I'mma close my eyes for a second. [laughter] for a split second now. I was right there by the house. I said, "I'mma close my eyes and see if I by memory I can see how to get to the house." Driving down the road, I open my eyes up real quick. I said, "That's how important the eyes are, right? I sense." But one thing about it, don't you know that the the the sense of sight, faith is more powerful than that? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can stop your ears. Sense is more powerful. Faith is got more powerful than the sense of hearing. Hallelujah. Faith is more powerful. I say it's one thing about it. If if if we need those five senses just that much, right? I said, how much more do we need the sense of faith, right? To be able to contact and reach God. And that's what I says, Lord. Hallelujah. It's got to come a time where we got to be able to reach you, right? What it is, faith has the power over death. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT? HALLELUJAH. Come on. Death, hell, and the grave. Faith to give you power over that, right? faith, believing that God, hallelujah, he owns all these things, right? HE'S IN CONTROL. HOW MANY believe that this morning? Come on. I believe that. Come on. There's three things that WE SAY. THE POWER OF THE DEVIL, THE POWER of faith, and the power of God. But when you know, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT THE THE the the Moses and his mother, right? You know, ONE THING ABOUT IT, THE POWER OF THE DEVIL, WHAT it was, TAKE ALL THOSE BOYS and throw them in the river, RIGHT? THROW THEM IN THE RIVER. All the animals and alligators out there. The devil's showing you his power. Right? Maybe she look at the river. River too high. He can't swim. Hallelujah. Even if he could swim, look at all the alligators out there, right? Look at the hippos or whatever it might be out there, right? The devil showing you all his power, right? But it WAS SOMETHING ABOUT FAITH. HALLELUJAH. Faith that they knew THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CHILD. HALLELUJAH. It was he WAS A PROPER CHILD. IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT I BELIEVE THAT GOD IS GOING TO USE THIS CHILD. RIGHT. So when the time came, what it was THE HER THE POWER OF FAITH. HALLELUJAH. WHEN WHEN SHE WHEN SHE GOT DOWN TO THAT RIVER, THAT'S WHEN FAITH TOOK OVER, RIGHT? SHE TOOK THAT CHILD AND PUT HIM IN A BASKET, RIGHT? BUT WHEN SHE RELEASED THAT BASKET, WHAT TOOK OVER? THE POWER OF GOD TOOK OVER, didn't it? Hallelujah. It was no LONGER THAT THE DEVIL COULD HAVE HIS power because now it was in God's hand. Hallelujah. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. YOU GOT TO TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR HANDS AND PUT IT IN God's hands. Right? When it's in your hands, YOU GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING. YOU GOING TO KEEP WRESTLING. YOU GOING TO KEEP HAVING SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. YOU GOING TO KEEP HAVING PAIN. COME ON. BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN GOD'S HAND, HALLELUJAH. WATCH THE POWER OF GOD TAKE OVER. OH JESUS. NOTHING WON'T BE ABLE TO HARM IT. WHY? WHY? BECAUSE THE power of God took over, didn't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that this morning? It's something about it. Come on. I say, you know what? It's out of my hands. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Reason why you struggling cuz it's still in your hands, right? I got faith, but I'm holding on to it's got to get you got to get it out your hands, right? &gt;&gt; You got to get it out your hands and go on with God, [screaming] RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU PUT IT OUT OF IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT AND GOD GOT TO TEACH US THAT. &gt;&gt; Come on. You don't just learn that overnight, right? God got to teach you that &gt;&gt; to let it out. It's out of my hands. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I done tried this and and it done failed me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I done tried and I can't do nothing with it. Hallelujah. I done been up sleeping sleepless nights going through going through. I done tried. Come on. But God, you got to learn how to pray. Lord, help me turn it over to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God, I believe you, Lord, that you're ABLE TO KEEP THAT WHICH I COMMIT TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. AND GOD, I'M PUTTING THIS IN YOUR HAND. HALLELUJAH. AND GOD, WHEN I PUT IT IN YOUR HAND, I'MMA WALK AWAY FROM IT. HALLELUJAH. I KNOW THAT GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF IT. HALLELUJAH. I KNOW THAT GOD WILL HANDLE THAT SITUATION. AND I AIN'T GOING TO GO GET IT BACK OUT HIS HAND, BUT [screaming] I'M GOING TO LET GOD DO WHAT HE DO. HALLELUJAH. I KNOW WHAT HIS PROMISE SAID. I KNOW WHAT HIS WORD SAID. AND I TRUST THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. That's where we coming to. We got to learn how to trust God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Some things are out of your hands, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. SOME THINGS ARE OUT OF YOUR CONTROL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. But one thing about it, when you put it in God's hand, &gt;&gt; it ain't nothing too great for God. Hallelujah. I like how God asked uh Abraham any of those. He said, "Is there anything too hard for the Lord?" &gt;&gt; Come on. And I asked you that question this morning. Is there anything too hard for the Lord? Come on. Your situation, your trial, come on. What you faced with, is there anything too hard for the Lord? Come on. Well, why you still holding on to it? Put it in God's hand. &gt;&gt; Come on. You still holding on to it, wrestling with it. I don't have to wrestle with it no more. I'll put that in God's hand. &gt;&gt; Come on. I can see those Hebrew boys. What was it? the power of the devil. Come on. IF YOU DON'T BOW DOWN TO this image, we going to throw you in the fire. Hallelujah. Maybe they saw the fire. Some could feel the heat from the fire. But what it was, their faith. Hallelujah. Their faith was in almighty God, right? Though the fire was there in front of them, though the threats was there, maybe they didn't even hear a voice from God, RIGHT? BUT THEY KNEW WHAT THEIR GOD WAS CAPABLE OF. HALLELUJAH. AND THEY EVEN TESTIFIED OF THAT, RIGHT? THEY HAD A TESTIMONY THAT PLEASED GOD. HALLELUJAH. THEY SAID THAT EVEN IF HE DON'T COME, WE BELIEVE THAT HE'S STILL ABLE. HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL RIGHT NOW. HALLELUJAH. IF GOD DON'T SHOW UP, [screaming] HE'S STILL ABLE. HALLELUJAH. HE'LL STILL MOVE MOUNTAIN. HE STILL RAISE THE DEAD. HE STILL HEALS THE SICK. EVEN IF [screaming] HE DON'T, HALLELUJAH. OH, JESUS. Their testimony pleased God, didn't it? Come on. And when the power of faith took hold. Hallelujah. They let it go. When the power of faith was over with, what happened? The power of God stepped in, didn't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. In the midst of the fire, I can see the power of God there. Hallelujah. Come on. The fires all around them, but they couldn't GET BURNED. HALLELUJAH. NOT EVEN A HAIR ON THEIR HEAD, not none of THEIR CLOTHES, NOTHING COULDN'T get burned. What it was, THE POWER OF GOD stepped in. Hallelujah. Come on. WALKING WALKING WITH A TESTIMONY LIKE THAT. WHAT COULD SHAKE YOU? HALLELUJAH. WHAT IT IS, YOUR TESTIMONY OUGHT TO BE building you. Hallelujah. FROM FROM GLORY TO GLORY, HE OUGHT TO BE CHANGING YOU. HALLELUJAH. WHAT GOD BROUGHT YOU THROUGH ONE TESTIMONY THROUGH ANOTHER, YOU OUGHT TO BE MOVING. HALLELUJAH. OH JESUS, LITTLE BIT HIGHER. &gt;&gt; COME ON. I BELIEVE that with all of my heart. Hallelujah. David said the lion to bear Goliath JUST WHAT IT IS. COME ON. &gt;&gt; BRINGING YOU THROUGH.

But what it is, it's got to become more than just talk. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's got to become more than just, oh, we danced and we shouted. Come on. But it's time for fighting now. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's time to let go and let God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe that you got to let go and let God have his way. How many believe that this morning? Come on. Faith in action. said, "I got faith." He says, "You got faith without works." Come on. That's dead. He says, "But I got faith, and I'mma show you by my works." Right? Cuz I'm going to go ahead and start claiming those things that that were not as though they were. Hallelujah. I'm going to go ahead and start speaking it. Call me crazy. Call me whatever you want. I'm going to go ahead and start speaking it. Not only I'm speaking, I'm preparing for it. I'm walking in. Hallelujah. Why? Because God promised me. And one thing, I know that his word don't he can't lie. Come on. He's not a man, but he he's he's God. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he DON'T NEED NOBODY SUPPORT TO [screaming] DO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. HE'S GOD ALL BY HIMSELF, AIN'T HE? &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. Somebody give God praise this morning. [applause] Oh, Jesus. You know, I says one thing about it. God is so good, ain't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. So many so many testimonies. I says faith in action. So many uh uh testimonies, right? So many cloud of witnesses. We've got here. You can read it sometimes in Hebrews. But like I said, it wasn't that they didn't go through something, right? They had mighty trials, but what overcame was their faith, right? &gt;&gt; Somewhere along the line, they learned to trust in Jesus. Come on. Somewhere along the line, you know, I was talking to one of my uncles once and before he passed some years ago and he was sick and he says, he says, he called me Jermaine. said, "Jermaine, you do you do you think God can heal me?" I said, "I know God can heal you." I says, "But will he heal you?" I said, "That's up to him." I says, "But one thing about it, let me talk to you about faith." Hallelujah. I said, "The same faith that you had when you got saved." I says, "You gave your heart to the Lord and all of a sudden you just begin to telling everybody, "I'm saved. I'm saved. I'm saved." Right? I said, "Until you walk right into it." Hallelujah. You kept confessing it, right? And the more you confess, things dropped off your life. You walked into it, right? I said that's the same thing with healing. You got to confess it. Hallelujah. You can't keep walking around saying, "I feel. I feel. I feel because faith don't go by feeling." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith is the things that we the rust touch the thing that's unseen. Right? I said you got to walk and say, "I'm healed." Hallelujah. And you ain't telling no lie. How you say I ain't telling no lie? He says because with his stripes you are healed. Hallelujah. He healed you already when he died on Calvary. Hallelujah. Don't you know that the work was finished? What I need you to do is walk around and say, "I'm healed." Hallelujah. I'm healed. I don't want to hear no. Come on. Faith got a good report. I don't want to hear no evil report. I'm healed. I'm blessed. Hallelujah. I might be fighting, but I'm blessed. I'm healed. Hallelujah. I'm victorious. Walk. KEEP WALKING UNTIL YOU WALK into it. Hallelujah. Somebody give God praise. Amen. [applause] I said, "That's what you got to do." Amen. You got to walk into it. &gt;&gt; Come on. You got to walk. Some people don't know what I'm talking about. But you got to walk into it. Come on. When you're speaking faith in action, what am I doing walking into it? Those children of Israel, hallelujah, when they got to the land and they said, "Oh, the enemies there, right?" But they knew that God gave them a promise, right? Every place the soul of your foot touch, I'mma give it to you. Right? So what they had to do, they had to walk into it, didn't they? And everywhere they walked, though the enemy might have seemed like it was large, this land belonged to me. Hallelujah. THIS GROUND BELONGED TO ME. WHY? BECAUSE I STEPPED on it and God promised it to me. Hallelujah. So I'm walking into it. Hallelujah. I'm walking into it. My healing. I'm walking into my deliverance. I'm walking into the promise. What it is, YOU GOT TO WALK. HALLELUJAH. WALK into it. Oh Jesus. Sometimes you got to do that. I said faith in action. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See the enemy trying to take your voice. &gt;&gt; But I believe God got something he want to say. &gt;&gt; Come on. And I believe that God can say what he want to say. Hallelujah. One thing about it, the devil tried to shut God's mouth, but he can't never do that. Hallelujah. He thought he had him when he took him down in the grave. Hallelujah. But he didn't realize that at the third day. Hallelujah. He was going to rise, but this time with all power. Hallelujah. Death was going to lose his sting. Hallelujah. And it wasn't going to BE NOTHING THAT HOLD OVER YOU AND I. &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHEN HE send the spirit back, how many thank God for that this morning? Come on. We talking about faith in action. AMEN.
