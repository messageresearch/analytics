[26:19] word man our New Testament scripture
[26:21] reading be coming from 2 Corinthians 5
[26:24] amen for we know that if our Earthly
[26:27] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[26:30] we have a building of God and house not
[26:32] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[26:35] for in this we groan earnestly Desiring
[26:39] to be clothed upon with our house which
[26:41] is from Heaven if so being that clothed
[26:44] we shall not be found naked for we that
[26:47] are in this Tabernacle do groan being
[26:50] burdened not for that we would be
[26:53] unclothed but clothed upon that
[26:56] mortality might be swallowed up in life
[26:59] now he that have wrought us for the
[27:02] selfs same thing is God who also hath
[27:05] given unto us the earnest of the spirit
[27:09] therefore we are always confident
[27:11] knowing that whil we are at home in the
[27:13] body we are absent from the Lord for we
[27:17] walk by faith and not by sight we are
[27:20] confident I say and willing rather to be
[27:24] absent from the body and to be present
[27:26] with the Lord amen

[30:14] [Music]
[30:23] Amen good
[30:25] afternoon can you hear me
[30:28] afternoon family good afternoon so I
[30:31] wrote some things about my Uncle
[30:35] [Applause]
[30:35] [Music]
[30:37] Frank bear with
[30:43] me one of my earliest moments of my
[30:46] childhood with my Uncle Frank was in the
[30:49] early 90s when he used to come to my
[30:51] grandmother's house and fellowship with
[30:53] the
[30:54] family now around this time I'm about 8
[30:57] or N9 years old
[30:59] and I know my Uncle Frank is you know my
[31:01] Uncle Frank Sierra's Dad I'm Betty's
[31:06] husband but on this one particular day
[31:08] Uncle Frank pulls up in a gold Nissan
[31:12] 280Z and he's handing out
[31:15] money and of course me being a young bro
[31:18] young man I am I'm right there next to
[31:20] my uncle prank Uncle Frank is talking to
[31:22] me and most of my cousins about being a
[31:25] man and being making our own
[31:29] way so you ask me what do I know around
[31:32] eight or n years old about giving game
[31:36] and I would tell you I had no idea but
[31:40] it at this moment in my life I realized
[31:43] that my Uncle Frank was the
[31:45] man Uncle Frank would often talk to us
[31:48] about working hard as a man doing the
[31:52] right thing how it would always pay off
[31:55] but ultimately making smart decision is
[31:58] and having
[31:59] Integrity would always keep us ahead of
[32:01] the
[32:02] game he not only told us how to be good
[32:05] men he showed
[32:07] us there were always times where my
[32:10] Uncle Frank showed up and always gave
[32:12] the best
[32:14] advice he was one of the most important
[32:16] pillars in my life and I highly
[32:19] respected him I remember the first time
[32:22] I I bought a new car and he spoke to me
[32:24] about integrity again about maintaining
[32:27] the in the field of what I
[32:29] own about not letting any and everyone
[32:32] work on my car even though it might be a
[32:34] little
[32:36] cheaper also about how not letting any
[32:39] and everyone inside of
[32:41] it too often as men we don't get our
[32:45] flowers but in the same way I feel that
[32:49] flowers from one man to another they
[32:52] come in forms of
[32:54] handshakes and I like to think every
[32:56] time I saw my Uncle Frank
[32:58] I gave him his
[33:00] flowers maybe not in the form of
[33:02] beautiful bouquets but in firm
[33:05] handshakes always confirming the thank
[33:08] yous yeah I appreciate
[33:11] you yeah I see
[33:13] you for not only simply showing the way
[33:17] but leading the
[33:18] way at every term of my life I always
[33:21] knew if I needed some advice I could
[33:23] make a trip to go find my Uncle
[33:25] Frank whether he was in the restaurant
[33:27] he on with Uncle Pete arounded around
[33:30] town in that stinking
[33:32] Lincoln I always knew I could count on
[33:34] Uncle Frank to deliver a word that word
[33:37] would always be
[33:39] encouraging it always would have
[33:41] integrity and it always will make you
[33:44] feel seen and
[33:46] understood I will miss those
[33:48] words I will miss those conversation
[33:50] that often started with now Jonathan let
[33:53] me tell you
[33:55] something but most of all I'll miss my
[33:58] Uncle Frank our Uncle

[1:06:27] all right Uncle Frank all right she she
[1:06:30] knows how to get next to him and my son
[1:06:35] says I told him often times I said Thank

[1:06:43] children the impact that he had on their
[1:06:48] lives he would always try to see where
[1:06:52] they at and what's going on with them
[1:06:56] not only did he do my children like
[1:07:00] that if you came to bride Tabernacle and

[1:07:32] them and they could see and often times
[1:07:35] they said Daddy Uncle
[1:07:38] Frank this and Uncle Frank that I said
[1:07:42] yeah I said and that's why I would go
[1:07:45] back to him and said thank you thank
[1:07:50] you it's so many
[1:07:52] things but just to have somebody
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:57] I
[1:07:57] remember in '
[1:08:00] 83 and the beginning of ' 84 I came to
[1:08:03] columia came back
[1:08:05] home past down in Maran County all that
[1:08:09] time and I came back
[1:08:11] home and I came back home and I
[1:08:14] had something that Colombia as a whole
[1:08:18] had never
[1:08:19] heard same Bible same gospel
[1:08:25] but columia as a whole hadn't
[1:08:28] heard from the
[1:08:32] angle and I said to brother
[1:08:36] Frank now he's going to hold you and
[1:08:40] make sure you with the
[1:08:42] book now you know a lot of people just
[1:08:44] go to
[1:08:46] church they don't
[1:08:48] study they're not checking out the
[1:08:51] preacher if I said something I said
[1:08:53] brother Frank Frank said hey
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:08:58] wait what you
[1:09:00] say you said what I said did I say it
[1:09:04] like that he said yeah but you know you
[1:09:07] can't talk like that to God's
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:11] people I said okay I said well I got to
[1:09:15] I I'm sorry I better make sure I get it
[1:09:17] straight you know sometimes you know he
[1:09:21] kept you in
[1:09:22] check you just couldn't do anything say
[1:09:25] anything around him am I I don't care
[1:09:28] who you
[1:09:29] were he going to come up to you and talk
[1:09:32] to
[1:09:33] you he had that boldness about
[1:09:38] him so when I came to
[1:09:41] Colombia
[1:09:43] Frank he studied he he checked things
[1:09:47] out you're not just going you going
[1:09:49] you're not going to tell him
[1:09:51] anything and when he got through
[1:09:54] checking he was introducing me to family
[1:09:57] members come and see aun so and so on
[1:09:59] come and see and then I was able to
[1:10:02] share the good
[1:10:04] news that the Bible here is open to me
[1:10:09] now I got something I want everybody to
[1:10:11] know people have been reading this Bible
[1:10:14] I I read it backwards and forward but
[1:10:16] now I got something I want to
[1:10:18] share he said oh Lord you got something
[1:10:22] that's different no it's it's the same
[1:10:25] Bible it's in the Bible but seems like
[1:10:29] folks ain't preaching
[1:10:31] it
[1:10:33] so it was stories
[1:10:36] like Sarah and Abraham had become young
[1:10:40] people and they were 99 years old and
[1:10:46] they was going to have a child but I
[1:10:48] didn't
[1:10:49] know looking back that the king
[1:10:54] wanted to have Sarah so Abraham told a
[1:10:58] lie told her tell the king you my
[1:11:04] sister are you with
[1:11:06] me and God was getting ready to kill him
[1:11:09] now how come a king want a 90 year old
[1:11:16] lady a king don't want to marry a 90y
[1:11:20] old lady going to take your bride from
[1:11:23] you she was turned young again
[1:11:28] and because she was young again it's
[1:11:30] showing you what's in store for you and
[1:11:34] I God got a new
[1:11:37] [Music]
[1:11:39] body God got another
[1:11:43] body brother Frank going to be young
[1:11:48] again are you with
[1:11:51] me you say I knew that all the time I I
[1:11:56] didn't you
[1:11:59] see it's just nuggets all over the Bible
[1:12:03] do you know that when people were
[1:12:06] looking for Jesus he was already
[1:12:09] there but the they know it they read
[1:12:13] their Bibles backwards and forwards and
[1:12:15] they studed the word and they didn't
[1:12:17] even recognize Jesus when he
[1:12:20] came matter of fact they told Mary she
[1:12:23] was lying
[1:12:26] cuz they told Jesus we be not born of
[1:12:31] fornication so they didn't believe he
[1:12:33] was virgin
[1:12:35] birth are you with me amen so most
[1:12:39] people when it comes down to Revelation
[1:12:41] and Truth they don't believe it they
[1:12:44] just go to
[1:12:45] church and feel
[1:12:47] good but whether or not they understand
[1:12:51] what's going on for the hour that we
[1:12:53] live in have no clue
[1:12:56] they all right I just go to church I
[1:12:58] will be good God going oh
[1:13:02] yes that's what's
[1:13:05] wrong brother Frank wasn't like
[1:13:08] that he studied the
[1:13:11] word you know a lot of people come to
[1:13:13] church even to this church they don't
[1:13:17] study you can preach all you want all
[1:13:20] they do
[1:13:27] not brother
[1:13:29] Frank you you you you going to come out
[1:13:31] the book and you going to come right
[1:13:33] amen are you with me amen I got a
[1:13:39] close see they my family pray for me so
[1:13:44] hard they pray that I don't make y'all
[1:13:52] mad see cuz when Jesus uh uh when he
[1:13:57] spoke he was
[1:14:00] plain and he was
[1:14:02] simple but they didn't like
[1:14:06] it why because he told
[1:14:09] them told them the
[1:14:12] truth are you with
[1:14:14] me it we had an hour wait there's
[1:14:17] another football player
[1:14:21] there call them the
[1:14:23] truth oh you a
[1:14:26] when it come down the
[1:14:29] truth you know folks think I'm I want
[1:14:31] the
[1:14:33] truth come
[1:14:35] on come
[1:14:38] on you want somebody to tell you you all

[1:14:45] wrong I'm all right I love the Lord

[1:39:46] families especially young men
[1:39:49] lives father I pray that that impact
[1:39:54] will carry on
[1:39:56] Lord that the Jesus that he knew the God
[1:40:00] that he
[1:40:02] served the God that he
[1:40:06] loved that they would fall in love with
[1:40:08] the same
[1:40:10] God for he realized who died for his
[1:40:14] sins and he was willing to accept the
[1:40:17] Lord as his personal
[1:40:19] savior I wonder if there's one hit
[1:40:23] today that have not accepted Jesus
[1:40:26] Christ as their personal
[1:40:29] savior he sheded his blood for
[1:40:33] you he died that you can have eternal
[1:40:36] life but the question is do you

[1:40:42] look at him is that one that would raise
[1:40:44] your hand said pastor pray for me I want
[1:40:46] to accept
[1:40:47] Jesus just lift your hand thank you
