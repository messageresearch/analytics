rock that is higher than i amen let's run in the ark of safety the book of romans 8 and 27 amen we thank god again for songs we thank god again for all of you this morning 8 27 he that searches the heart knows what the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercessions for the saints according to the will of god and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose may god bless the readers where you may be seated now we said we this morning we want to we got a little reverb we want to talk about to them who are the call amen we're talking about to them who are the call so the call this morning what if we are the call then why were we call to them who are the call if god called you then he called you for precipit reason and god had a purpose in calling you you just didn't call us to come to church and just to sit around god called you for a purpose now you could not be called and i mean you could not hear the call except you had an ear to hear he said he that has an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit says see many people amen don't have ears to hear but if you have an ear to hear you can hear what the spirit says to the church he said there'll be many call but few are chosen we're talking about the call and the chosen amen you've been called and you've been chosen for a design and for a special reason and a purpose amen out of all the millions in the world god chose one in a million amen god chose you out of all the people in the american all the people in colombia south carolina and all the people all the people in your family god chose you it don't it doesn't matter how how bad we want uh how how much we want our family members to be saved one thing about it we can thank god that god saved us amen we cry out daily and we want to claim them in jesus christ's name but thank god that god chose you god called you and chose you amen maybe he called them but maybe they wasn't listening maybe they put it off and says well god i'm not ready i don't uh that's not for me but when god called you you know that was the voice of god to call you it says here he says to the call according to not your purpose so don't when when you come when god called you you know paul says and saul on the way to the master he said lord what would thou have what do you want me to do you know many people god called them but they want to do their own thing but paul realized that the one that called him had something for him to do said lord what what what what do you want me to do amen then he began to describe he meant paul amen assault amen i want you to go down to the street called straight amen and they'll find one by the name of ananias and he'll pray for you because you've been blind by this light praise god so he's his eyes amen became blind because the light was so bright and when he fell to the earth he said who are thou lord the lord said i'm jesus whom you persecuted in other words god had connected his people up to him and he's saying that my people is jesus when you persecute my people you persecute me amen because they are the party and i'm the head and that's me are you a man so uh he went down and analyzed amen told him to rise and be baptized and wash away his stripes amen wash away your sins come on amen people don't want they meant to wash away their sins they don't want to be baptized in water in the name of jesus christ and wash it with your sins but peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen you've been called amen not just for water baptism but to receive the vindication of your calling and god comes down amen to with the water amen with the spirit the water the word and to bring the word to life amen to bring you amen to recognition and to realization amen that you are the seed gene seed of god amen and god comes to vindicate that to you by giving you the spirit baptizing you in the body amen and when you are baptized in the body amen you become one with christ by one spirit are we baptized into one body and because god baptizes you into the body amen you become a part of god which you were a part of god when before the world was before the foundation of the world you were connected with god amen and you just come back came in as gene seed in the mind of god when he took your picture there they met before the word was they met you came in the negative form but now you go back to the positive here we are this morning amen praise god by god providence god had a plan in his mind and you were part of god's amen plan before the foundation of the world amen now we're not excited about our journey sometimes because we don't really realize the purpose of god amen in our lives amen you know i'm so glad that amen i it's a journey i i told i think my my son i said i think it's friday night i said i felt like running he said why didn't you i said well i said i just took it he's just such a sweet spirit in the in the place until i felt like running praise god but you know me and brother gordon we we we we we're in the recovery mode amen thank god amen we're getting there amen it'll be something amen if i get to running and brother fred take out after me amen but god bless you this morning here in romans 8 again i i want to pick up you've been called according to the purpose of god amen and and god didn't make a mistake amen i'm going to tell you something some you know if god if you were making the decision to choose a bride or uh somebody for god amen i'm gonna tell you something i wouldn't want you all some of y'all to make that decision i wouldn't even want to make the decision i'm so glad that it's out of my hand it's god's hand because i'm afraid i might miss somebody but i know god amen in his divine providence he phone knew you are you with me we are so busy looking at the outward appearance but god is seeing something beyond that he says here the 29th verse for whom he did what amen as the prophet said he took a picture of you so he saw you there he saw you as a gene he saw you at the thought he saw he has an attribute in the mind of god he also did what he predestinated because he knew that one day you would come into decision making time you'll come into this world and you will have a choice to make and god predestinated you because he knew what church you would make he saw your choice he knew the end from the beginning he saw you making the right decision amen i'm going to tell you something the devil will bombard your mind and play tricks on you and have you thinking all kind of crazy stuff and amen sometimes you think am i worthy but who is worthy the prophet said our first birth was an adultered birth we came forth in sin are you open because of what eve did in the beginning amen we came forth born in sin shaping in what shaping in the nicotine isn't that right so there was nobody that was born right everybody was born wrong he that is born of a woman is a few days full of trouble amen so we cannot lay hold on uh i am a simmons i am a good time of that that don't mean nothing you were born in sin you're just a sinner are you a man and without amen you couldn't do you said i had nothing to do with that you had nothing to do with it that's the way you were born but we have something to do with getting out of it now amen jesus made a way for you that you can be born again are you with me so if jesus provided a way out then you need to take advantage of jesus amen that call you that chose you amen you don't have to steal sinner now you mind mind you as many people that are churchgoers and many people that say i'm saved amen many people that say i'm bribed many people are saying i'm this and i'm that that's just a talk but it's got to go something deep it's got to be a revelation to you amen cain might have thought he had it all together but his sacrifice was not accepted amen because he didn't have a revelation brother sister you must have a revelation of who you are you must have a revelation by faith amen praise god your faith amen it just can't be amen i'm just going through the motion you got to have a revelation amen of your relationship with god that you are part of him are you with me i'm more than just a church girl i'm you're more than just somebody that's been baptized in water i'm more oh god see because many times amen we latch onto things but we're never able to manifest amen it's something amen that you cannot you know you cannot fake this there are a lot of hypocrites amen there's a lot of crows are you with me there are a lot of folk that say i'm holy but they're not holy amen the only way we you and i are going to be holy is because the holy god has come down and tearing knocking in us oh wait a minute oh i'm getting ahead of myself but i got to go ahead on him he says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed unto the image of his son there's no use in us trying to be like somebody else he to be conformed in the image of his son sometimes we ask the question what would jesus do what would jesus do in situations in life because he has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son do you see your life becoming more and more like jesus are you satisfied with just being who you are but god wants to conform you into his image amen you want you to be like him somebody said to be like jesus oh how alone to be like him so meek and lowly so armored and holy you know i thought about people don't they don't seem as though there's not that sacredness about christians anymore amen that's not that holy hush about christians anymore people look like they are satisfied amen with the worldliness they let the world creep in anything the world is doing the church feel like i can do it but i'm going to do it in a holy way amen oh yes we can do it the holy way amen the instead of the the standard of holiness amen in a holiness standing people have lost their uh spiritual minds amen well that's not spiritual they meant uh uh you think preachers ought to be spiritual you think people ought to be uh but their holiness and the righteousness and the pureness of holiness people don't even understand it so how can god vindicate how can god come down in supernatural ways amen and do supernatural things when the people are so worthy amen sense lost his hair are you with me people are losing amen the holiness amen but you have been called you've been chosen you have been called to be holy praise god i don't you know we're so much interested in being happy and being holy i want to do it my way amen but it's not your way that god wants god amen it's his purpose you're called according to his purpose god got a purpose and a standard amen don't lower your standards don't give in to the world hallelujah it's something about the beauty of holiness god have mercy amen if god called us to be holy amen he said for those calls i sanctify myself amen that in order for you to be sanctified i sanctify myself sanctify them also through that word through thy truth oh lord god wants the truth amen you ought to say lord thank you lord i love you for calling me to be holy oh a wretched sinner as i but you called me out oh gideon look like i will reject amen but god called gideon amen the least of all in israel wasn't even a part god a letter a holler like rehab to be in a genealogy he said your ways are not my ways but your thoughts are not my thoughts god takes the lords oh god it said predestinated according to the image of his conformed to the image of his son that you might be the first mourn of many brethren more of whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also justified whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if god what who can be against us if god be for us who can be against us i'm gonna tell you when god is for you don't worry about what the world said about you what the world think hallelujah there's something about god being for you lord have mercy amen we want something to energize us oh god i'm thankful amen you can have the whole world whole whole wide world but give me jesus that's what i want i want jesus praise god this world gonna pass away everything in this world gonna pass but give me jesus i want jesus amen i'd rather have jesus in this whole world brother and sister you got to make up in your mind it's jesus worth he meant the sacrifice it is worth it praise god is jesus whoever he called for you ain't meant for a design and for a precipitate purpose amen god calls you and what he wants to do is bring you into adoption to the placing of the son amen but for the prophet god says amen he said i go away to prepare a place for you yeah that's what jesus said amen but he says now you are the play amen you are the place that god has chosen the place that he has prepared is you are you with me that he's prepared a place for you and praise god what is it the in my father's you are the house that god has prepared are you a man are you realizing that god has gone away to prepare a place for you to in my father's house with you the house of god that god wants to reside in you you are the house of god hallelujah you built up oh hallelujah and that place is prepared and sometimes we're looking away up there and over there amen but god has chosen you to be the place where he wants to dwell amen and through seven church ages god has been preparing a place for his father's house amen you are the house of god amen you are the habitation which god wants to dwell in you praise god and look at him amen as he build this house from faith to virtue building his house amen praise god you're built up upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophet jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone are you up man god building a house amen that he can dwell in praise god look at god building the church amen the body amen of christ amen the church is his body amen praise god where oh hallelujah hallelujah i go to prepare a place for you that where i am that ye may be also and whether i go you know thomas said lord we know not whether i go how can we know the way jesus said i am the way the truth and the life are you with me no man can come to the father except he come by me amen god has called you brother and sister to be a house the house of god the place amen everybody comes you know in the church but it's all about adoption and placing of a son and god brings you into sonship brings you into your position amen god didn't just just call you but amen into the promised land you come on crossover joy and into the promise of god but you got to be positioned in place in the promise are you a man god had a place for napoleon god had a place amen for reuben amen god got a place for you god got a place in the body amen that was full known and ordained for you before the foundation of the world and god will place you in your inheritance amen and you oh hallelujah just don't come to church get in your place get in your position just don't be happy because you're chosen but you amen must be positionally placed in the body praise god because you say i'm not the head amen that i'm not a part of the body i'm not defeat because i'm the hand amen don't worry about it god has ordained before the foundation of the world your position and your placing and the spirit of god the holy ghost will place you positionally in the body amen praise god but if the hand says because amen i'm not defeated then i'm not of the body are you with me we get in a lot of trouble because everybody want to be ahead look at it you see just a head nobody oh you see feet just feet you know sometimes we want to be amen what we want to be amen but god amen praise god oh hallelujah he positionally placed you where he wants you to be god and do what he wants to do in your life amen you cannot get around god predestinated plan for you you can run but you can't hide praise god amen do what god called you to do and don't worry about what folk think about it praise god if god called you to praise him to be a prayer war whatever god called you to do do it hallelujah it's time to amen stop with excuses and knowing amen the most exciting thing is to be calm and to be chosen if you just praise god god will do the rest but you just be thankful and grateful to god god to do the rest amen what's the matter with that's not getting in our place in our position it's because we ain't thankful but we read we have to praise god so lord i love you lord i praise you amen i might build nobody and nothing but god i love you hallelujah when i come and i'm excited to be in amen he said i'd rather be a goalkeeper in the house of the lord amen if you just let me be a dope keeper that'll

god but you are amen but you got to give god what he wants it's if god be for you amen what when you begin the moment complaining you saying god ain't for me that's when he's against me everything you believe in our god if god before you joseph brothers don't matter who powerful wife whatever if god are you with me god that calls you're gonna do what he's just saying praise god i don't care how unsatisfied you are they meant god never left himself without a witness gotta have somebody that's gonna stand they mean people can have fun all around but god's gonna have somebody that's gonna enjoy holiness they're not giving joy amen laying hands on the sick and seeing the sacred cove god gonna have somebody that's gonna be able to get a prayer to somebody that's gonna sign cry because of the abomination done in the city somebody that said i'm not shouted by god until my husband is shamed to my wife to say to my children they're saying god i'm not satisfied i'm gonna keep on crying out god

and lord have mercy that somebody gave you a island but he said i give you all things what what is that in comparison to god giving you all freely giving you all things and that's a promise for god and god cannot lie and he said he'll freely give us all things and don't you worry about a thing you're gonna have it if god said so i said if god says so it's yours i don't care what the devil brings to your mind i don't hold lord have mercy praise god the devil are sometimes those stumbling blocks and try to you and try to oh do all kind of stuff praise god amen you might go through some things in life but if you've been called and you've been chosen god's going to bring you out of it amen all the stuff that the devil tried to trap you and inspire you and make you feel like you ain't worthy but thank god amen god through the blood of jesus has made you worthy praise god hallelujah oh it's only in christ are we worthy they mean none of us outside of christ are worthy oh you look only in christ are you worthy amen only in christ are you justified only in christ are you perfect amen it's because you're in christ amen that's where your perfection come from amen glory be to god amen because of him i'm who i am amen not because of my good but not because what we've done is because of what he's done oh and i'm so thankful for him hallelujah oh yes sometimes we sit around and see our insufficiencies he said but your sufficiency amen is not of us but our sufficiencies of god amen god has given us all things amen you got to enjoy what he's given you but if you ain't enjoying you think the devil got something better brother and sister i i don't believe that lying devil do you i believe he's a liar so when he offers you something you know that he's a liar amen devil get behind me satan are you with me praise god hallelujah god got better for me amen god got better for you as the son and daughter of god amen you got to know who your father is and your father knows what's best are you with me oh hallelujah he says here freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifies i'm gonna tell you something there's a lot of characters in the bible that you can look at but he said it's god that justifies it no matter how many times i tell the story of the different ones you know who would choose to holler like rahab who would make that decision that rehab your holo that means you're out of it you know most of us are saying not who would choose a woman caught in the very act of adultery who would choose that kind of woman who would allow this woman that has been prostituting herself to put this precious ointment on my feet and wipe my own jesus doesn't he do he do things that beyond our comprehension of understanding but yet we are so ready to reject somebody if they just look like they look at us the wrong way we make a decision in our mind if somebody wronged us one time you would never be a joseph that could forgive your brother and treat them with kindness praise god you would say it's my turn now it's payback time are you with me see brother and sister it's not in a christian to do certain things but you got to realize god is trying to bring you into your position into your place and the only way he can do that is he's got to stop you long enough to see amen you call you're chosen and i can take care of all the in-betweens to get you where you need to be praise god you're going to have some failures and some disappointing time amen praise god rahab had her time ruth was a more bitis god had to go find her she wasn't in the message she was in some denomination but god bought her because she was predestinated seed amen god knew her ah you can't boy has recognized her amen

obey the word and let god change lives when god give the holy ghost he might give the holy ghost to somebody you think how in the word did that happen how in the world did they get the holy ghost and i've been praying for years and ain't got it yet person walked through the door and received the baptism of the holy ghost and are willing to live a godly life are you with me it's how how bad do you want it do you really want god or do you really want church some people have a good time in church they have a good time just living it up is it anything going in the soul that changes the life of a man anything going deep enough down to root out every and to give you a deeper love for god that you really fall in love with this god and say god i love you with all of my heart you know what causes a backslider when a a person that falls out of love with god say god i don't love you no more you cannot love god and backslide somehow you must fall out of love with god how can i love god and love the world also if any man love the world what you see what i'm saying how can that uh backslider is to turn your back on god amen to reject the love of god when you love god you would not reject him when god is saying wound you and says i love you with everlasting love have i love you with the love and kindness have you drawn us have he done enough to prove that he cared have he done enough to prove to you that i never will leave you and i never will forsake you or do you charge him for adversities and things that happened to you in life do you hold god blame for amen things that happen in life i'm gonna tell you a lot of people think god is to blame and that's why i'm gonna tell yourself why i'm gonna go if i turn my back on god what is gonna happen to me what am i going you think i'm gonna go to the book of man that old devil that old serpent amen you think i'm gonna go and and fall in love with that old line deceitful brother schemer sister praise god they chose the rappers they chose barriers called and chosen your time to make your decision they said crucify him shall we crucify him again he said i died this generation for the second crucifixion how about you brother are you crucifying christ afresh are you trotting under the fake blood of christ brother and sister what are you doing or do you esteem him do you say to god god no matter what i go through i never leave you because you said you'll never leave me you said you'll never forsake me i to god i made a commitment to you i recognize how much you care about me i serve you because i believe you i believe what you said you've been faithful i said he's been he's been faithful you have faith for god and he's been faithful to me brother and sister he's faithful don't you want to cry with tears of god you've been faithful why should i not be faithful back i had some scriptures that i wanted to read maybe i just skip over and i come to my conclusion in revelation 19. tell you something it's a lot of churches but there's only one bride the elect lady that's only one god chose you to be that god has chosen you to be that elected lady i can't i'll tell you something i've been tempted i know we've been tried and tested something about what he's done for me you it's been many disappointments in life many times the devil had come and said give up you know it's a constant battle just to stand in the pulpit sometimes because we're living in a terrible time with people the bible said they take to themselves teaching having itchiness men will love pleasure more than god they're trying to make the church a place of entertainment when you're having contests and this and contests and that and who's going to shine the brightest they're making the church who can shout the best of dance the best who can oh god and it's creeping into the god word promised word for the hour and people are accepting it because they think that they got to they got to conform to the world all the jokes and all the playing around and all the justin and all the craziness is going on out there people are saying come on amen we're trying to do everything to hold the young people and the young people are backsliding but it's that old-time holy ghost that old-time holy ghost with people have cried long enough but listen to the prophets some folks won't stay long enough to get the baptism of the holy ghost you need the baptism in the holy ghost that's the only thing going to keep you i don't care what you do in the church i don't care what kind of uh programs and what kind of things you put on in the church the only thing going to keep them is the baptism of the holy ghost if they don't get the holy ghost i don't care what you do to try to please them they go on anyhow or you have a worldly church people putting on a show yes something about getting the giving not just gifts so people who want to experience the gifts but not to give them i've heard hearing the prophet of god says that's what the people want to give the gifts to be in the church but forgetting about the giver are you with me i think we're more interested in the gifts than we're interested in together we need him we need jesus in us we need jesus now if it ever been a time when the church i'm going to talk about are people afraid to stand by themselves but brother and sister it's a lonely road in this hour it's a lonely road in this hour i'm talking individually it's a lonely road if you got somebody that's standing with you and trying to hold a standard then thank god for you brother sister if you got somebody that's trying to live a godly life and holding to the word thank god for you brother sister because there's not many people are slipping in their slides and they don't seem to even care anymore they don't seem to care preachers are saying i used to stand for this and i used to stand for that but i find out i got a new revelation and sometimes they try to brother simmons i said you know you're not going to bring that by me go do what you want to do at the end of the road god got to finally say song are you with me but i wonder how many are going to stand how many is going to really take a stand for god it's too many things and i can't bring them on the air see sometimes we have to cut it off and talk to you a little bit but you got to get desperate you got to get out on your knees and say god whether or not you mean business with god or not that god can't bless you with what you need then don't worry about it don't try to get something god don't want you to have are you with me and if you're not willing to give up what these things that's going to hinder you from being a christian for god if you're not willing to give them up then you love them more than you love god and if you love the world more than you love god then the love of the father is not in you brother and sister people say brother simmons i believe you to believe and not do is faith without works is dead brother and sister it's no excuse for us not living a holy life i don't care what the rest of the people do you've been called to holiness you've been called to live with god you say well i want to go deeper in revelation knowledge you know i'm going to tell you something you better get the bases first you better get your abcs first always believe christ you better get down to business where you really have a relationship and know god first then try to get algebra are you with me i think it's too many people been doing the algebra doing the deep things of god praise god they're trying to oh lord i'm not going to make you believe that you're somewhere you're not i'm not going to tell you you're going to be justified in everything you do blessed is the man whom god would not impute in sin i'm going to tell you something he's talking about that person that god looks at their heart and god is able to predestinate him but you and i are going to be responsible for the life we live god's gonna hold you accountable but god says there's no excuse because i made a way for you i've actually made a way for you to get out of i got to stop god it's good isn't it but you have to do everything to hold
