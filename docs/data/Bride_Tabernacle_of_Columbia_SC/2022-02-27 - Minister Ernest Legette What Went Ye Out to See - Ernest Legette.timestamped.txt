[43:10] when you got it's amen
[43:12] and it reads
[43:14] and it came to pass when jesus had made
[43:16] an ending an end of commanding his
[43:18] twelve disciples he departed thence to
[43:21] teach and to preach in their cities and
[43:23] now when john had heard in the prison
[43:26] the works of christ he sent two of his
[43:28] disciples and said unto him art thou he
[43:31] or thou he that should come
[43:34] or do we look for another you may be
[43:35] seated
[43:37] i'm gonna continue reading a little
[43:39] further down
[43:40] fourth verse here it says jesus answered
[43:42] and said unto them go and show john
[43:45] again these things which ye do hear and
[43:48] see the blind receive their sight and
[43:50] the lame walk and the lepers are
[43:51] cleansed and the death here and the dead
[43:53] are raised
[43:54] and the poor have the gospel preached
[43:56] unto them and blessed is he whosoever
[43:58] shall not be offended in me and as they
[44:01] departed jesus began to say unto the
[44:03] multitudes concerning john what went ye
[44:05] out into the wilderness to see
[44:08] a reed shaking in the wind
[44:10] but what weren't you out to see a man
[44:13] clothed in fire and raiment behold they
[44:15] that were
[44:17] they they that wear soft
[44:19] clothing are in king's houses but what
[44:21] went ye out to sea for a prophet yea i
[44:24] say unto you and more than a prophet for
[44:27] this is he of whom it is written behold
[44:30] i send my messenger before thy face
[44:32] which shall prepare thy way before thee
[44:35] verily i say unto you among them that
[44:37] are born of a woman
[44:39] a woman
[44:40] there have not risen a greater than john
[44:42] the baptist not with notwithstanding
[44:45] he is
[44:47] the
[44:48] he that is least in the kingdom of
[44:49] heaven is greater than he and from the
[44:52] days of john the baptist until now the
[44:53] kingdom of heaven suffering violence and
[44:55] the violence take it by force for all
[44:57] the prophets and the law of the prophets
[44:59] and the law prophesied unto john and if
[45:01] you receive will receive it this is
[45:04] elias
[45:05] which
[45:06] was for to come may god it blessed to
[45:08] the reading of his word
[45:10] this morning by grace of god just for a
[45:12] moment i don't tend to be long
[45:14] and i entitled i titled a message this
[45:17] morning what went ye out to see amen
[45:20] what went ye out to see
[45:22] we know that here in the scriptures and
[45:24] the setting of the scriptures and how
[45:26] you know john came to us came to a point
[45:30] in his life where you know he had done
[45:32] whatever god asked him to do
[45:34] and i guess he i believe he lived though
[45:36] the way that and god asked him to do and
[45:38] he fulfilled this mission
[45:40] even how
[45:42] you know when jesus stepped on the scene
[45:43] he says behold i must decrease and he
[45:45] must increase
[45:47] he said you don't follow me no more but
[45:49] he is the one that i've been telling you
[45:50] about that's coming you know the to
[45:52] carry on him the sins of the whole world
[45:55] and aren't you glad of that today
[45:57] that god came to carry out carry all of
[46:00] our burdens
[46:01] you know sometimes we carry things that
[46:03] we ought not be carrying come on
[46:05] when all we got to do is say lord i know
[46:07] you came to carry these things
[46:10] so sometimes i believe that we got to
[46:12] get back into that place in our lives
[46:14] that at once before we didn't want to
[46:16] carry nothing
[46:18] but we got on our knees to god in prayer
[46:20] and we gave it all to him and he carried
[46:22] it didn't he come on and sometimes you
[46:24] got to get back to that place to where
[46:26] you get down and you say lord i can't
[46:28] carry this load by myself
[46:30] god i can't carry these burdens and
[46:32] these things that are the uh the trials
[46:34] and tribulations i'm going through lord
[46:36] they too heavy for me come on
[46:38] and then he comes and he says what come
[46:40] under me all you that are heavy laying
[46:42] with burden and i'll give you rest
[46:44] he says take my yoke upon you and learn
[46:46] to me come on for my yoke is easy and my
[46:49] burden is light
[46:50] god here are all these burdens i got god
[46:52] i want you to carry them you know what
[46:54] the devil's trick is don't you know god
[46:57] came to take all that weight off you
[46:59] he come to release you of all that pain
[47:02] and all of the weight come on you know
[47:04] the bible said talks about his
[47:05] righteousness peace and joy in the holy
[47:08] ghost
[47:09] it didn't say weight depression and all
[47:10] these things but it's righteousness
[47:12] peace and joy
[47:13] but what the devil uh does he tricks you
[47:16] and i through mind battles and or what
[47:18] not to get us to carry these these
[47:20] burdens carry these weights and these
[47:22] things these trials in these
[47:23] tribulations he wants you to fight your
[47:25] own battles but once you get to
[47:27] revelation that the battle ain't yours
[47:30] and that the footsteps of the righteous
[47:32] are ordered by the lord it ain't nothing
[47:34] that will come your way that god ain't
[47:35] even already solved he already worked it
[47:38] out he got the answer for it all you got
[47:40] to do is praise god in the midst of the
[47:42] storm come on and let god carry those
[47:45] burdens
[47:46] i was back there uh meditating to myself
[47:49] i said lord i'm giving it all to you
[47:51] i'm giving it all to you god i'm giving
[47:54] you all my words i'm giving you my
[47:56] children i'm giving you all of my
[47:57] thoughts and my problems giving it all
[47:59] to you lord
[48:00] hallelujah and once you give it all to
[48:02] him watch god work it out
[48:04] come on and don't don't pay attention to
[48:06] how the situation is unfolding and and
[48:09] all those things come on because
[48:11] that don't mean nothing remember god's
[48:12] got it all in control the ship might
[48:15] look like it's sinking but long as jesus
[48:17] is in the ship come on it might go under
[48:20] but he'll raise it back up again how
[48:22] many believe that this morning i believe
[48:24] that with all of my heart why because
[48:26] i'm a witness today that god he's not a
[48:29] failure he never failed come on so i
[48:32] said what went you ought to see
[48:34] you know we find that uh john
[48:37] you know pointing them out said they
[48:39] said this is the one and but then we
[48:41] find that john gets to a place in his
[48:43] christian journey
[48:44] down in prison he got thrown in prison
[48:46] some say that jesus never even went to
[48:48] visit him so he got to the place the way
[48:50] he was down in the dumps come on
[48:52] sometimes thinking maybe in his mind
[48:54] just just kind of dramatizing it maybe
[48:57] in his mind thinking all that i'm doing
[48:59] i'll uh give my whole life to live for
[49:02] the lord and now here i am in prison and
[49:04] he ain't even come see about me come on
[49:06] is god forgot about me matter of fact
[49:09] asking the people we'll go ask him is he
[49:10] the one or shall we look for another
[49:13] why because john had preached a messiah
[49:15] that was going to come with a fan in his
[49:17] hand come on john preached a messiah
[49:19] that was coming with an axe laid at the
[49:21] root of the tree but yet when he saw
[49:24] jesus come down to jordan river he
[49:26] looked like a meek and a lowly man a man
[49:29] that was walking that didn't even seem
[49:30] like he could hold his head up a man of
[49:32] a few words come on
[49:34] but yet john preached that when he come
[49:36] it was going to be fire hallelujah ain't
[49:39] that what he preached come on so i could
[49:41] see john now in prison like the prophet
[49:44] of god was saying his juniper tree
[49:46] experience a juniper tree experience
[49:49] well thinking you know i haven't done
[49:51] all that and yet where is god i mean why
[49:53] he hadn't come recognize me come on but
[49:56] it's something about i want to say to
[49:58] you this morning you don't you don't you
[50:00] can't beat god given come on
[50:03] god ain't gonna never forget your labor
[50:05] and love the labor of that that god that
[50:07] you're doing come on
[50:09] god ain't gonna forget that
[50:11] god will never forget you
[50:13] talked about how you know the animals
[50:15] and all the people even people they
[50:17] might forget their children but god will
[50:19] never forget you
[50:20] you grave in them in the palm of his
[50:22] hand come on god's got you in his mind
[50:26] come on
[50:26] and you he can't never forget you so no
[50:29] matter where you are remember i did what
[50:32] all god asked me to do come on and now
[50:35] like paul said i know that there's a
[50:36] crown of life laid up for me i'm going
[50:39] to nero's shocking block but god ain't
[50:41] forsaking me why because he is his word
[50:44] and he said in his word that i'll never
[50:46] leave you nor forsake you no heaven and
[50:48] earth will pass away my word i'll still
[50:51] be here hallelujah and i'm part of that
[50:54] word
[50:54] hallelujah do y'all believe that this
[50:57] morning come on so god i'll never forget
[50:59] about you come on what it is that's the
[51:02] devil playing tricks on your mind
[51:04] remember when when that roll is called
[51:06] up yonder i believe my name will be on
[51:09] that roll and i pray to god this morning
[51:11] each and every one of our names be on
[51:13] that road that's all we come to
[51:16] today to live our lives for
[51:18] give our all come on we didn't just come
[51:20] here for just for the motion but we come
[51:23] here to make preparation

[51:27] come to prayer service and all those
[51:29] things what do we live such godly lives
[51:32] for not to just say we hoping come on
[51:35] and all these things but in our souls
[51:38] something says i know that my redeemer
[51:40] lives
[51:41] in your soul something says i know that

[52:19] spirit is willing
[52:20] what's driving us the the holy one come
[52:23] on that inside something on the inside
[52:26] keep nudging you telling you to go ahead

[52:29] you struggle you battle you're fighting
[52:31] come on i know you're tired
[52:33] but keep fighting to in the morning keep

[53:04] well it says that what it is john
[53:06] got to that place and we know that you
[53:09] know in that place where he was but god
[53:11] didn't forget about him did he
[53:12] when he sent his disciples back and and
[53:15] they began to talk to jesus one thing
[53:17] jesus didn't just give him a clear
[53:19] answer to say yes um
[53:21] i'm here go tell him yes he didn't do it
[53:23] that way but he says i want you to just
[53:25] hang around a little while
[53:26] come on and i want you to go back and
[53:28] tell john the things that you're seeing
[53:31] come on the manifestations are the gift
[53:33] of god
[53:34] i want you to go tell them how you
[53:36] hearing the poor got the gospel preached
[53:38] to them ain't you glad today that god
[53:40] don't just come to the high and mighty
[53:42] but he come to the low and the lowly
[53:44] come on the ones that don't even have a
[53:47] dollar in their pocket come on one that
[53:49] don't have the best suit to put on the
[53:51] walk in the house of god but god come to
[53:53] the lowest of the lowest god comes to
[53:55] that man on the street corner god goes
[53:57] to the crack house god goes to the place
[54:00] to where women
[54:01] maybe came in fame and all these things
[54:03] but that's what god the gospel come to
[54:05] be preached to them
[54:07] to let them know i know you're bound i
[54:10] know the devil has got chains on you but
[54:12] the word come to set you free hallelujah
[54:16] oh jesus come on i'm so glad that the
[54:19] word set me free
[54:20] you know
[54:22] in a place in my life uh growing up and
[54:25] and how to when the lord began calling
[54:27] on you come on
[54:28] you i was at a place in my life where
[54:30] things had me bound
[54:32] sometimes you think well all i got i can
[54:34] give up this night you think those are
[54:36] the easy things
[54:37] but then god is certain things that that
[54:39] attach themselves to your spirit and
[54:42] those aren't the things that are easy to
[54:44] let go
[54:45] those are the things that god by the
[54:47] holy ghost come on the anointing that
[54:50] destroys the yokes it's got to come down
[54:53] come on and go into a place the way man
[54:56] can't reach
[54:57] going to that place the way the preacher
[54:59] can't see what's going on in your life
[55:01] go into that place the way you don't
[55:03] have no control over but yet when the
[55:05] word when the word comes it begins to
[55:07] divide those things it begins to go down
[55:10] into that place where the strongholds
[55:12] are hallelujah and begins to pull down
[55:14] them strongholds next thing you know you
[55:17] begin to walk free you don't know when
[55:19] it happened hot happened but god did it

[55:26] now come on it's still things in the
[55:28] places that god want to reach i said

[55:40] that place don't you worry about how
[55:42] or when come on let god in let the
[55:45] anointing come and destroy those yokes
[55:48] pull them down hallelujah because we
[55:50] wrestling against flesh and blood but
[55:52] we're wrestling against powers come on
[55:54] rulers of darkness spiritual wickedness
[55:57] in high places
[55:59] but god is our battle axe hallelujah
[56:01] he's our fortress come on he's our will
[56:04] in the middle of the will come on he's
[56:07] the fire that'll quench heavy fire oh
[56:09] jesus hallelujah i'm so glad that god is
[56:14] on our side come on
[56:17] when god is on your side ain't nothing
[56:18] the devil can do to you do you believe
[56:20] that this morning
[56:22] come on i says what weren't you out to
[56:24] see we know that john like it says he
[56:27] his disciples came and jesus began to go
[56:30] tell him i want you to go back and show
[56:31] john the things you're seeing come on
[56:34] and done the things you're hearing and
[56:36] all these things say then he'll know
[56:38] because we know that you know god is
[56:40] known by his characteristics come on
[56:42] he's the same yesterday today and
[56:44] forever
[56:45] god changes mass but he'll never change
[56:47] his nature come on what he was he will
[56:49] always be
[56:50] come on i like that and how i like how
[56:53] god told joshua once he says as i was
[56:56] with moses come on first thing he told
[56:58] him moses my servant is dead now come on
[57:01] but even though moses is dead he said as
[57:03] i was with moses i'm gonna be with you
[57:04] that same way you don't have to look at
[57:07] yourself as being no less come on the
[57:09] only thing separates you between you and
[57:12] the uh other like the ministers and so
[57:14] forth like that is the calling that god
[57:16] got on your life but nevertheless god is
[57:18] still god he's god in the ministry he's
[57:20] god in the loyalty come on he's god and
[57:23] the one the little one that don't even
[57:24] sing a song come on but don't you know
[57:26] you still got rights with god you still
[57:29] can go and hold an audience with god
[57:30] just as the preacher can just as the
[57:33] deacon and the trustee all those kids
[57:35] you still got rights to go hold the
[57:37] audience with god
[57:38] and when you call don't you know god i
[57:40] answer your prayer don't you go know
[57:43] that
[57:43] yo your prayer can stop god
[57:46] hallelujah
[57:48] stop him
[57:50] make him turn to hear someone calling
[57:52] come on hallelujah
[57:55] do you believe that this morning
[57:57] come on but we find that like i said
[57:59] john you know sit uh disciples so he
[58:01] told him to go back uh uh and tell them
[58:03] the things you seen but then jesus began
[58:05] to ask the people a question he says
[58:08] what weren't you out to see
[58:10] when he was concerning john talking
[58:11] about john he said when you when you
[58:13] went out what did you go out to see come
[58:15] on did you go out to see a reed shaking
[58:18] in the wind come on
[58:19] man that's gonna change with every wind
[58:21] that blower did you go out and see
[58:23] somebody dressed in fine raiment we know
[58:25] how he looked a wild man come on coming
[58:27] out of the wilderness and all those
[58:29] things he said did you go out to see a
[58:31] prophet come on he said but i tell you
[58:33] more he was more than a prophet he says
[58:35] that there was not a man at that time
[58:37] born
[58:38] a woman that was greater than john about
[58:41] come on because of the the the
[58:43] commission that he gave and the
[58:45] dedication i believe in the life that he
[58:47] lived before god but the thing is that's
[58:50] why he asked him what went you ought to
[58:51] see don't you know you get whatever you
[58:54] expect
[58:55] a lot of people went out but everybody
[58:57] expectation wasn't the same
[58:59] and we find that even here today you
[59:02] know i say this morning what did you
[59:04] come out to see come on
[59:06] whatever you came don't you know
[59:07] whatever your expectation level is
[59:09] that's what god will give you
[59:11] some just went out next
[59:13] the spectate come on some went out to
[59:16] criticize some didn't even go out at all
[59:18] because they just didn't believe but
[59:20] then they were had some that went out
[59:22] because they were looking for a word
[59:24] from god some went out because they
[59:26] heard more than just john's voice crying
[59:29] in the wilderness but when they heard
[59:31] that voice crying they felt something
[59:34] down in the deep calling hallelujah i
[59:37] don't know what it is but i know that
[59:40] it's something to what john is saying
[59:42] hallelujah and that's what it is today
[59:45] the word of god going out it's got to go
[59:47] past your intellectual thought
[59:50] your intellectual mind and reason but
[59:52] it's got to be come to a place the way
[59:54] the call of god when it calls out is
[59:57] something down in the deep that you
[59:59] hearing and it reaches down in that
[1:00:01] place and it begins drawing on you
[1:00:04] do you believe that this morning come on
[1:00:07] i said what went you ought to see many
[1:00:09] times you know we look back at our lives
[1:00:12] and you know each and every one of us
[1:00:14] at one point in our journey in our life
[1:00:17] god began to call in on you come on
[1:00:20] something began to drawing on you no
[1:00:22] matter where you were
[1:00:23] no matter what condition of the life
[1:00:26] that you was in something began drawing
[1:00:28] on you somebody's in that place i
[1:00:30] believe this morning where they ain't
[1:00:32] answer the call yet but something is
[1:00:34] calling on you in that place the way you
[1:00:36] call it a crossroad you don't know which
[1:00:39] way to turn to the left or to the right
[1:00:41] but what i want to say this morning is
[1:00:43] he to the call come on that call the
[1:00:45] legion come on the shepherd know where
[1:00:48] he's going he called at the sheep by
[1:00:50] name and he lead them out god will lead
[1:00:53] you out
[1:00:54] all you got to do is answer the call
[1:00:56] come on
[1:00:57] what we find out says a lot of times
[1:01:00] what we ought to see come on a lot of
[1:01:02] times in our lives we look back and you
[1:01:05] know no matter where you were in life at
[1:01:07] one point god began calling on you that
[1:01:09] voice began calling you come on and you
[1:01:12] went out come on to see what the call
[1:01:14] was about
[1:01:15] to see what the attraction was about
[1:01:17] come on but yet we we grab sometimes i i
[1:01:21] say i says what you know what what did
[1:01:24] you go out when you went out what did
[1:01:26] you go out to see come on because many
[1:01:28] people had different expectations
[1:01:30] some just wanted to be delivered from
[1:01:33] whatever life that had them bound and
[1:01:36] that they can just go on and live a
[1:01:37] normal life well if that's all you're
[1:01:39] expecting that's all you'll get come on
[1:01:42] some they want it in their heart to
[1:01:44] please god
[1:01:45] some wanted the the really live for god
[1:01:48] come on not just to be delivered from
[1:01:50] what they were but they really really
[1:01:52] wanted to give their heart to god come
[1:01:53] on and i want to say that what it is a
[1:01:56] lot of times they're coming out ain't
[1:01:59] the hard part come on a lot of times are
[1:02:01] coming out is the easy part but going in
[1:02:05] come on that's the hard part going in to
[1:02:08] the land come on not just coming out the
[1:02:10] world and being sanctified come on or
[1:02:13] justify sanctified come on but going on
[1:02:16] in to the hole is the holiest
[1:02:18] going on in to the baptism of the holy
[1:02:20] ghost going on in to that place to where
[1:02:23] your soul is satisfied
[1:02:25] many people they came out but yet their
[1:02:28] soul ain't satisfied they flesh might be
[1:02:30] satisfied this spirit might be satisfied
[1:02:33] but their soul is still thirsting still
[1:02:36] hungry hallelujah for the living god
[1:02:39] well i want to say if you still
[1:02:41] hungering there's a god to quench that
[1:02:43] hunger there's a god that quits that
[1:02:46] thirst you got to let him in hallelujah
[1:02:49] and let him have his way in your life
[1:02:51] oh jesus
[1:02:53] glory
[1:02:54] i was sharing with someone the other day
[1:02:57] i said the thing is i says it's all
[1:03:00] right to come out and be and give your
[1:03:02] light to the lord and the lord clean
[1:03:04] your life up i says but if you don't
[1:03:07] ever go on into the baptism of the holy
[1:03:09] ghost you don't ever get a personal
[1:03:12] experience with god it might be 10 years
[1:03:14] it might be 15 years it might be 20
[1:03:17] years on down the road but sooner or
[1:03:19] later those same spirits gonna catch
[1:03:21] back up with you why because you didn't
[1:03:24] let god fill the house come on you
[1:03:26] didn't let god come in and occupy down
[1:03:29] in the rims of the soul so the demons
[1:03:31] always be out there i i began to tell
[1:03:34] them i said but one thing what god does
[1:03:36] god wants to annihilate demon powers out
[1:03:39] of your life when they were standing on
[1:03:41] the red sea i like how moses told the
[1:03:44] children of israel he said the egyptians
[1:03:46] that trouble you today come on they'll
[1:03:48] trouble you no more forever why because
[1:03:50] god was getting ready to deal with them
[1:03:52] god was getting ready to storm i want
[1:03:54] you to watch with your eyes hallelujah
[1:03:57] when i destroy them so you won't have to
[1:03:59] worry about it when you sleep at night
[1:04:01] knowing that those demons are still out
[1:04:03] there that those the enemies still out
[1:04:05] there you don't have to worry about it
[1:04:07] because i destroyed them all hallelujah
[1:04:09] and that's what god wants to do each and
[1:04:11] every one of our lives you don't have to
[1:04:13] be worried about a past desires and
[1:04:16] things why because that man is dead
[1:04:19] hallelujah
[1:04:20] you become a new creature in christ
[1:04:22] all things have become new
[1:04:24] that man that they talk about he doesn't
[1:04:27] even exist no more why because god has
[1:04:30] did a work in your life he took away
[1:04:32] that old heart and he gave you a new
[1:04:34] heart he took away that old nature and
[1:04:36] he gave you a new nature fills you with
[1:04:39] a spirit hallelujah then you and him
[1:04:41] became one how many believe that this
[1:04:43] morning
[1:04:44] hallelujah that's why we rejoice when
[1:04:47] people talk about our past and where the
[1:04:49] lord has brought us from come on
[1:04:51] sometimes the devil may anoint people to
[1:04:54] try to bring that up to try to make you
[1:04:56] feel guilty come on but when the lord
[1:04:59] has really delivered you you don't feel
[1:05:01] guilty no more when you really seen the
[1:05:03] effects of the cross you don't feel
[1:05:05] guilty no more because you know what the
[1:05:07] blood of jesus has done for you
[1:05:09] hallelujah then you can testify like
[1:05:12] paul and he says uh many of us walk that
[1:05:15] way in times past we all walk that way
[1:05:18] he said but god
[1:05:20] who was rich in mercy
[1:05:23] hallelujah in his love wherewith he
[1:05:25] loved us
[1:05:26] god didn't leave us in sin but he was
[1:05:28] rich in mercy oh jesus
[1:05:31] remind me of where i came from come on
[1:05:33] because why it's given me my joy that's
[1:05:36] where i get my peace that's where i get
[1:05:38] my shout that's where i get my song when
[1:05:41] you remind me of where i came from
[1:05:43] because it reminds me of the goodness of
[1:05:45] god it reminds me of the grace of god
[1:05:48] hallelujah oh jesus
[1:05:52] hallelujah
[1:05:53] come on you know i says one thing
[1:05:56] what happens you know i was looking at
[1:05:58] something this morning and how the
[1:06:00] prophet god was saying what the church
[1:06:02] world today what they struggle with is
[1:06:04] forgiveness
[1:06:06] come on
[1:06:07] he said they struggle with forgiveness
[1:06:09] he says that when one fall away from
[1:06:11] among them or fall he says that what
[1:06:14] they do instead of
[1:06:16] gathering together to try to win such a
[1:06:18] one back or restore the brother or the
[1:06:20] sister he says that that they run them
[1:06:22] further away by that by their what but
[1:06:25] they're talking
[1:06:26] come on
[1:06:28] instead of getting together try to win
[1:06:30] and encourage that brother he said we
[1:06:32] push him further away come on he said
[1:06:34] that's what the church world struggles
[1:06:36] with today he said but the reason why
[1:06:38] they do that is because they they
[1:06:40] haven't really experienced the power of
[1:06:42] forgiveness themselves
[1:06:44] because when they really experience the
[1:06:47] power of forgiveness come on you really
[1:06:50] realize god really showed you how down
[1:06:53] in the darkness you was and how wretched
[1:06:55] and miserable you were and how is his
[1:06:58] grace and his mercy came down and
[1:07:00] overshadowed your life come on and
[1:07:02] forgave you he said then you'll learn
[1:07:04] how to appreciate forgiveness then you
[1:07:06] won't mind extending forgiveness to
[1:07:08] somebody else you won't mind hallelujah
[1:07:12] you know it's one thing he was saying he
[1:07:14] says one thing he says it ain't a day he
[1:07:17] said it ain't an hour that go by that we
[1:07:19] don't do something wrong
[1:07:21] come on
[1:07:22] but what the problem is today
[1:07:25] is that we don't we don't want to come
[1:07:27] to the reckon and not skip down a little
[1:07:29] bit we don't we don't want to come to
[1:07:31] the reckoning that we do stuff wrong
[1:07:32] come on
[1:07:34] and that's what the church world had a
[1:07:35] problem with john's ministry john the
[1:07:38] baptist preached repentance
[1:07:40] that was his main ministry that was his
[1:07:41] main sermon was the people to repent
[1:07:44] come on but yet you had you know the we
[1:07:47] got in the church three types of
[1:07:49] believers you got the unbeliever where
[1:07:51] he just don't believe anyway but then
[1:07:53] you got to make believer come on
[1:07:55] and what does that make believer do
[1:07:57] don't you know that's a lukewarm spirit
[1:07:59] come on and where he thinking he
[1:08:00] righteous he don't see the need to
[1:08:02] repent because he thinks he's all right
[1:08:04] come on not knowing that when he in that
[1:08:07] condition the way he don't see the need
[1:08:09] for repentance and that's from the poor
[1:08:11] pit to the back door come on
[1:08:14] that he's worse than the man that's out
[1:08:16] there in the street at least that man
[1:08:18] out in the street know what kind of
[1:08:19] condition his life in he know where his
[1:08:22] head but to make believe come on the one
[1:08:24] that don't see the need for repentance
[1:08:26] yet the apostle paul
[1:08:28] he declared that he had to die daily
[1:08:31] come on he declared that when he desired
[1:08:33] to do good evil was present with him
[1:08:36] come on he declared that it was a war
[1:08:38] going on in his life hallelujah but
[1:08:40] nevertheless come on that make believer
[1:08:43] what does he do come on he don't see the
[1:08:46] need for repentance
[1:08:47] does he
[1:08:48] come on
[1:08:49] you know it's something about
[1:08:51] it's something about uh
[1:08:53] you know in this age
[1:08:54] how christ said it would people would be
[1:08:56] blind
[1:08:57] miserable wretched naked and don't know
[1:08:59] it
[1:09:00] you know to be blind is bad one thing to
[1:09:03] be miserable is one thing
[1:09:05] to be naked is one thing
[1:09:07] but to be all of those things and not
[1:09:09] know it is a whole different level
[1:09:11] come on
[1:09:12] that's a whole different level
[1:09:14] to be all those things and not know it
[1:09:16] come on but nevertheless i said god
[1:09:19] anoint our eyes with ourselves
[1:09:22] come on that we'll be able to see the
[1:09:24] condition of our lives
[1:09:26] that we won't be caught up in a false uh
[1:09:29] pretense or religion come on
[1:09:31] thinking everything is all right safe i
[1:09:33] don't have the need for repentance come
[1:09:35] on
[1:09:36] well we got to die daily do you believe
[1:09:38] that this morning come on i said that
[1:09:40] you know that's what they had problems
[1:09:42] the people of that day had problems with
[1:09:44] john
[1:09:46] ministry
[1:09:47] because of that
[1:09:48] one of his main things was to preach was
[1:09:50] a preaching repentance what we find that
[1:09:52] i says what went you ought to see it was
[1:09:54] a time you know like it says we can
[1:09:56] bring it from so many angles it was a
[1:09:58] time in your life when god calls you
[1:10:00] come on
[1:10:00] god and and what happened god i i was
[1:10:04] praying the other day and i was kind of
[1:10:05] envisioning the whole thing i said god
[1:10:07] standing at the door or standing far off
[1:10:10] making that call come on something
[1:10:12] attracted you
[1:10:13] and you went out i says but when you
[1:10:16] went out what'd you go out what'd you go
[1:10:17] out for come on i thought about so many
[1:10:20] of the patriarchs uh abraham and how and
[1:10:23] god began to call it on him come on and
[1:10:25] he went out i said abraham what'd you go
[1:10:27] out for come on he went out seeking a
[1:10:30] city whose builder and maker was god and
[1:10:32] i don't believe he was going to be able
[1:10:34] to rest until he got what he went out
[1:10:36] for come on i thought about the queen of
[1:10:38] the south and what she went out for come
[1:10:40] on because she had already heard of the
[1:10:42] supernatural things and the gifts and
[1:10:44] things that laid in king solomon her
[1:10:47] guard used them with wisdom and all but
[1:10:50] when she went out come on her
[1:10:51] expectation was right
[1:10:53] even when she got there it might have
[1:10:55] took a long journey to get there where
[1:10:57] she got she might have had to go through
[1:10:59] some things to get to where she got but
[1:11:01] when she got there god not only met her
[1:11:04] expectations but he exceeded her
[1:11:06] expectations i believe she said the half
[1:11:08] ain't been told and i believe that today
[1:11:11] what do you go out to see come on are
[1:11:13] you satisfied with just being a church
[1:11:15] member are you satisfied with just
[1:11:17] turning another leaf come on or just
[1:11:19] going in and out and living all right
[1:11:21] life come on are you satisfied or what
[1:11:24] did you go out to see hallelujah did you
[1:11:26] come out to see a god of jesus christ
[1:11:29] the same yesterday today and forever did
[1:11:31] you come out to see a god of miracles a
[1:11:33] supernatural god of power one that could
[1:11:36] save to the utmost hallelujah is that
[1:11:39] what you came out to see what if that's
[1:11:41] what you came out to see don't you know
[1:11:43] god exceeds your expectations
[1:11:45] i believe that
[1:11:47] do you believe that this morning come on
[1:11:49] that says what it is come on what you
[1:11:51] went out a lot of people came out
[1:11:54] come on
[1:11:55] but the going out like i said the coming
[1:11:58] out ain't the hard part but they're
[1:12:00] going in
[1:12:02] because there's a lot of wilderness out
[1:12:04] there come on
[1:12:05] israel they didn't see the enemies that
[1:12:08] they was gonna have to battle in the
[1:12:09] wilderness
[1:12:10] they didn't see the
[1:12:12] the dryness of the land
[1:12:14] and all those things did they come on
[1:12:16] but all of that god knew it was gonna
[1:12:18] work some things out of them come on
[1:12:20] he was gonna allow them to see things in
[1:12:23] their life that they didn't know was
[1:12:24] there come on things in their heart and
[1:12:26] their spirit come on because when they
[1:12:29] were bound no doubt the bible says that
[1:12:31] they cried unto the lord no doubt they
[1:12:33] were looking for deliverance come on
[1:12:35] some say they wanted a savior but they
[1:12:37] didn't want a lord come on and we find
[1:12:39] that many people have that same attitude
[1:12:42] today they got a savior but they don't
[1:12:44] want a lord but he doesn't just want to
[1:12:45] be your savior he wants to be lord reim
[1:12:48] supreme ruler over your life come on he
[1:12:51] wants to take you not only from this
[1:12:52] place but carry you on into glory come
[1:12:55] on into the deep things of god where he
[1:12:57] can do things with you that the world
[1:12:59] don't know nothing about he can reveal
[1:13:01] things to you that the world don't know
[1:13:03] nothing about come on god can give you
[1:13:06] special blessings how many want that
[1:13:07] this morning come on what i say is the
[1:13:10] going out to coming out they didn't see
[1:13:12] all that in the wilderness and all but
[1:13:14] going in was a hard thing you know one
[1:13:16] thing i say is
[1:13:17] that
[1:13:18] that
[1:13:19] hurt
[1:13:20] that god
[1:13:21] accounted to them
[1:13:23] was not
[1:13:24] all of the the murmuring complaining
[1:13:26] necessary necessarily or the sin but the
[1:13:30] bible declared that they didn't enter in
[1:13:32] because of unbelief
[1:13:36] that's what god held them accountable
[1:13:37] for come on was the unbelief
[1:13:41] all god wanted them to do was believe
[1:13:43] them
[1:13:44] come on
[1:13:45] and that's all god wants you to do today
[1:13:48] is to believe him
[1:13:49] sometimes god
[1:13:51] many times he does especially first
[1:13:53] starting out in your journey you might
[1:13:55] see all kinds of things he just god just
[1:13:57] do all kind of exploits and overboard
[1:13:59] why we get your attention
[1:14:01] but something somewhere along the lines
[1:14:03] got to anchor you come on
[1:14:06] down in the deep to where you know you
[1:14:08] come to that place the lord if you don't
[1:14:10] do nothing else you already done enough
[1:14:12] god i believe you come on because that's
[1:14:14] what all these things are for to do what
[1:14:17] to anchor your faith
[1:14:18] anchor your faith in god so where you
[1:14:20] can take god at his word you don't
[1:14:23] you're not uh you don't need the word
[1:14:25] plus but you got the word and the word
[1:14:27] is enough for you come on but he he he
[1:14:30] accounted he held him accountable for
[1:14:32] that that that through all these things
[1:14:34] he says that they perish in the
[1:14:35] wilderness because of unbelief and we
[1:14:38] today can look at the children of israel
[1:14:40] and say how can they not believe god
[1:14:43] when god did so many mighty works come
[1:14:45] on when god brought all the plagues and
[1:14:47] when the devil angel came through and
[1:14:49] how he opened the red sea and how he
[1:14:51] gave them bread from heaven and how he
[1:14:54] gave them water from the rock and how he
[1:14:56] did all kind of mighty and wonderful
[1:14:58] things for him how can they not believe
[1:15:00] god but yet they didn't and we find that
[1:15:03] today that god has done so many great
[1:15:05] things he's doing so many great things
[1:15:07] right now among us and for us but yet
[1:15:10] people still don't believe they still
[1:15:12] won't serve god they still won't love
[1:15:14] them
[1:15:15] hallelujah
[1:15:17] oh jesus
[1:15:19] but that's between them and god come on
[1:15:21] because on a day of judgment it won't be
[1:15:24] like the prophet of god was saying god
[1:15:26] never sent one person to hell come on
[1:15:28] man sends itself to hell why because he
[1:15:31] made a way of escape and they didn't
[1:15:33] want it
[1:15:34] he came from heaven
[1:15:36] died shed his blood
[1:15:38] that you don't have to be in the
[1:15:39] condition you in you don't have to walk
[1:15:42] in darkness
[1:15:43] but men love darkness rather than light
[1:15:45] why because their deeds are evil they
[1:15:48] need a nature change
[1:15:50] hallelujah and that's what happens today
[1:15:53] you need a nature change come on
[1:15:55] we were born wrong and sin did our
[1:15:58] mother conceive us
[1:15:59] we was liars from the womb cheetahs from
[1:16:02] the womb god know that
[1:16:04] he ain't gonna hold that against you but
[1:16:06] what he will hold against you was by him
[1:16:08] coming come on
[1:16:10] being rejected of men
[1:16:12] persecuted spit on wilt
[1:16:15] hallelujah went up to calvary shed his
[1:16:18] blood whosoever will let them come
[1:16:22] and yet you won't come come on the drink
[1:16:25] from that water life freely
[1:16:27] oh jesus come on what i find that i says
[1:16:30] what it is come on you say how could
[1:16:33] they not believe
[1:16:34] after all that but you fine they didn't
[1:16:36] come on but then you find that it was
[1:16:39] two
[1:16:40] come on out of all of those
[1:16:42] you no matter the obstacle now come on
[1:16:45] look
[1:16:46] that they were facing at that time
[1:16:48] looked to be
[1:16:49] way bigger than the obstacles that they
[1:16:51] came before before them
[1:16:53] looked to be like way more of a
[1:16:54] challenge but it was something that the
[1:16:57] bible says joshua and caleb had another
[1:16:59] spirit
[1:17:00] come on
[1:17:01] they didn't have the same spirit as
[1:17:02] everybody else
[1:17:04] they had another spirit come on
[1:17:06] because the other ones they were saying
[1:17:08] we in our own eyes look like
[1:17:09] grasshoppers come on but the spirit that
[1:17:12] joshua and caleb had in them come on god
[1:17:14] had already done enough
[1:17:16] he they already know what god who god
[1:17:18] was
[1:17:19] they already know that god was going to
[1:17:21] keep his word come on it didn't matter
[1:17:23] what was in the land come on but they
[1:17:25] knew that god was able
[1:17:27] we might be fewer number but they knew
[1:17:29] that god was able
[1:17:31] because their faith
[1:17:32] was anchored come on
[1:17:34] not just saying what moses said or any
[1:17:36] of those things but their faith
[1:17:38] somewhere along the line got anchored in
[1:17:39] god
[1:17:40] god anchored in the word of god and
[1:17:42] that's what we do today preaching the
[1:17:44] gospel what do we try to do get your
[1:17:46] faith anchored
[1:17:47] not in a man come on not in the church
[1:17:50] but get your faith anchored in guard
[1:17:52] come on that at the church fade away
[1:17:54] come on no matter who comes or who goes
[1:17:56] come on you can still be right there
[1:17:58] with god why because that's where your
[1:18:00] faith is anchored in there's nothing in
[1:18:02] between you and god but you've gotten to
[1:18:05] that place the way you went behind the
[1:18:06] veil come on the hole is a holist where
[1:18:09] everything is shut off you ain't hearing
[1:18:11] the noise of the world you ain't hearing
[1:18:13] the struggles and the battles of the
[1:18:14] world but you back there in that chicano
[1:18:16] glory where god is feeding you
[1:18:18] hallelujah it might be storming outside
[1:18:21] but in that chicano right there in the
[1:18:23] hole as a whole is
[1:18:24] in that place though it's storming
[1:18:26] outside though it's cold outside you in
[1:18:29] there with sunshine every day come on
[1:18:31] the light of the holy ghost is warming
[1:18:33] you and it's keeping you why because
[1:18:36] there is no death in that place there's
[1:18:38] only life and that's the place that we
[1:18:40] want to go to today this body might age
[1:18:43] but let me get to that place today where
[1:18:45] there's only life
[1:18:46] hallelujah that the skin worms though
[1:18:49] they might eat this flesh yet in my
[1:18:50] flesh i'll see god
[1:18:53] because i know
[1:18:55] hallelujah that my redeemer liveth and
[1:18:57] in the last days he'll stand on the
[1:18:59] earth and when he called my name i want
[1:19:01] to answer come on i will answer how many
[1:19:04] believe that this morning come on
[1:19:07] we don't doubt that but we believe that
[1:19:09] because that's a promise that god gave
[1:19:11] us how many thank the lord this morning
[1:19:14] jesus

[1:19:36] because you're going to get whatever you
[1:19:37] expect
[1:19:40] if you're expecting something from god
[1:19:42] god got something to give you
[1:19:44] come on
[1:19:45] you just came just to socialize and
[1:19:47] that's all you'll get
[1:19:49] if you come come on with your heart burn
[1:19:51] and desire come on might not even been
[1:19:53] for yourself but for lost souls
[1:19:56] for a family member for a friend come on
[1:19:59] i believe that if y'all if you get to

[1:20:14] ask a thing that ain't just a saying but
[1:20:17] that's reality
[1:20:18] i believe that come on so you say what
[1:20:21] did you go out to see come on i know
[1:20:23] that like i said when the lord saved you
[1:20:24] you might start off running then you
[1:20:26] come to that place of wilderness those
[1:20:28] trials things just to try you come on
[1:20:30] but you don't stop there what do you do
[1:20:32] you get back up and you keep on going
[1:20:35] god don't count the man that fall
[1:20:38] but god count them for not getting back
[1:20:39] up come on
[1:20:41] you fall but you get back up and you
[1:20:43] keep on come on we got a race to run i
[1:20:46] want to encourage y'all this morning
[1:20:47] let's get up and fight we got a race to
[1:20:49] run don't let the devil hold things over

[1:21:21] come on
[1:21:22] when you go out what are you going out
[1:21:24] to see
[1:21:25] come on
[1:21:27] because the word holds true
[1:21:29] everything that god said is true
[1:21:32] all his promises are yeah and not me
[1:21:35] come on
[1:21:36] i said so when you go out what are you
[1:21:37] going out to see
[1:21:38] come on
[1:21:40] god want to open your eyes you know it
[1:21:42] can be a lot of people in the same room
[1:21:43] but everybody ain't seeing the same
[1:21:45] thing
[1:21:46] everybody ain't feeling the same thing
[1:21:48] come on
[1:21:49] so why because some have an intern
[1:21:52] some minds
[1:21:54] have been
[1:21:55] captivated and just going all off
[1:21:58] into all these other things but then you
[1:22:00] got some that they came to hear a word i
[1:22:03] thought about that song this morning i
[1:22:04] don't know what you come to do
[1:22:06] come on
[1:22:07] but i come to give god praise i come to
[1:22:10] hear god's word
[1:22:12] a lot of times
[1:22:13] i know everybody pick at me because i
[1:22:15] say come on so much
[1:22:17] but i said a lot of times i say that
[1:22:19] because i be preaching to myself
[1:22:21] a lot of times say something i said come
[1:22:23] on because it's it's stirring to me too
[1:22:25] come on the ministry the preacher ain't
[1:22:27] just preaching to the congregation but
[1:22:28] he preaching it to himself
[1:22:30] something down to his souls amen in the
[1:22:33] word do y'all believe that this morning
[1:22:35] is the man up here just preaching out to
[1:22:38] y'all and he think that that he's uh
[1:22:40] he's doesn't need repentance himself
[1:22:42] then what happens he in bad shape too
[1:22:44] come on but what it is the word come to
[1:22:47] help us all
[1:22:48] that's what the word come to do
[1:22:50] they come to help us
[1:22:52] i say you got to let god help you
[1:22:54] come on god don't want to hurt you but
[1:22:56] god want to help you
[1:22:58] he knows your struggles and your battles
[1:23:00] he knows the the things you face with
[1:23:03] the peer pressures and all those things
[1:23:04] god knows all of that come on and don't
[1:23:06] you know he went through those things
[1:23:08] too
[1:23:09] come on he was tested and tried come on
[1:23:11] he went through all those things so not
[1:23:13] only does he telling you oh you can make
[1:23:15] it but he knows what you're going
[1:23:16] through
[1:23:17] come on he's a god that can be touched
[1:23:20] by the feeling of our affirmatives he
[1:23:21] knows what we're faced with
[1:23:23] he knows what what is life more so than
[1:23:25] each and every one of us come on to be
[1:23:27] rejected of all
[1:23:29] you know
[1:23:31] the creator of the world but when they
[1:23:32] came and he came to his own his own
[1:23:35] didn't even know him he didn't even
[1:23:36] receive him god know what that's like
[1:23:38] come on so when you come to god it ain't
[1:23:40] that he don't know what that's like he
[1:23:42] knows what that's like come on but he
[1:23:44] knows what it's like to overcome those
[1:23:46] things and he says that you're overcome
[1:23:48] too why because he's overcome the world
[1:23:51] and that's how you overcome by the
[1:23:52] through the blood of the lamb and the
[1:23:54] word of your testimony i say let's
[1:23:56] overcome this morning let us bow our
[1:23:58] heads in the word of prayer

[1:24:28] the seasons you won't be affected by
[1:24:30] them back there in that place
