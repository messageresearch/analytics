[32:11] moment worketh for us a far more
[32:16] exceeding and eternal weight of

[32:23] God while we look not at the things
[32:26] which are seen

[32:38] temporal but the things which are not
[32:41] seen are Eternal may God bless you to
[32:44] read this word you may be
[32:47] seated want to talk about looking unto
[32:49] the
[32:52] Unseen as I was praying I was I was just
[32:56] thinking about uh uh this morning about
[33:00] uh uh Simon the Sorcerer wanted to buy
[33:03] the Holy
[33:04] Ghost
[33:06] amen and I was thinking you can't bu the
[33:09] Holy
[33:09] Ghost but he thought that as he saw
[33:14] uh the Apostle lay hands on the people
[33:17] and they received the Holy Ghost down in
[33:19] Samaran he wanted to
[33:21] BU it's not for
[33:24] sale the Holy Ghost is not for sale amen
[33:28] some people want to abide their way to
[33:30] heaven or work their way to heaven but
[33:32] you can't do it true amen you can't buy
[33:36] and you can't work your way to heaven
[33:37] amen some people said you know may the
[33:40] work I done speak for me amen amen May
[33:44] the life I live speak for me
[33:48] amen are you with me but we understand
[33:51] to a real Christian they can't work but
[33:54] he said we are his workmanship created
[33:57] in Christ Jesus unto good works amen
[34:01] it's not the good we've done it's him
[34:02] that's done it amen he said my father
[34:06] hither to work so I work amen so he
[34:09] wasn't giving himself any credit for the
[34:12] things that were being done in Jesus
[34:14] life but he gave all the credit to God
[34:17] amen amen and as a Christian we give all
[34:20] the glory and all the credit to God for
[34:23] whatever is done amen amen a real
[34:26] Christian going to always praise the
[34:28] Lord amen lord it's you that's done it
[34:32] we haven't done
[34:34] anything and we can't do anything Amen
[34:37] to amen that we can glory
[34:40] in the Bible says let in his man Glory
[34:43] let him glory in the Lord amen so Simon
[34:47] amen seeing that he was a sorcerer amen
[34:50] working Witchcraft and had Bewitched the
[34:52] people thought he had everything under
[34:56] control amen
[34:58] but when uh philli come down preaching
[35:00] amen the kingdom of God Amen it was
[35:03] Revival in the city amen praise God and
[35:06] I said Lord you can't
[35:09] bu you can't buy the Holy
[35:12] Ghost then I thought about the there was
[35:15] two trees in the garden the tree that
[35:18] that were very interested because he put
[35:21] emphases on the tree of a life that was
[35:24] in the midst it was probably plenty of
[35:25] other trees but the Bible put emphasis
[35:28] on the tree of life and the tree of
[35:30] knowledge and good and evil amen and
[35:32] these true trees amen go all the way
[35:35] through until the coming of the
[35:37] Lord tree of life and the tree of
[35:40] knowledge of Good and
[35:41] Evil I'm just giving you pre before I
[35:44] get to the message the Tree of Life
[35:47] these are the things that was going
[35:48] through the tree of life and and the
[35:51] tree of a knowledge of Good and
[35:53] Evil I find that amen he the prophet of
[35:57] God said branches intertwine that's
[36:00] right you know what I'm saying so it it
[36:04] I was saying in uh thst night in Mullin
[36:06] if it was possible am if it was possible
[36:11] he he dece the very El but he said that
[36:16] he shorten the
[36:18] days for the elect
[36:20] sake God has to short these
[36:23] days if if he didn't short the days he
[36:26] said no flush be saved amen amen nobody
[36:30] would be saved if God did not shorten
[36:32] the days so God had to come by and
[36:35] shorten the days that any and for you
[36:37] and I to be
[36:39] saved things that's going on right now
[36:42] if God don't shorten the days nobody
[36:45] going to be saved amen but God short the
[36:48] days for the elect sake so by the grace
[36:50] of God the tree I find that as it was in
[36:56] the Garden of Eden so it is today people
[36:59] are more interested in the
[37:02] knowledge than they're interested in
[37:05] life people go to church and they're
[37:08] more interested in going to church to
[37:10] get knowledge than to get
[37:15] life life amen comes simply amen it's so
[37:22] simple but knowledge makes people puffed
[37:25] up and make them have have a lot of
[37:28] Pride about
[37:30] themselves but
[37:32] life is something that God gives amen
[37:36] are you with me Jesus said he didn't
[37:39] come to impress anybody he said I come
[37:43] that they might have what life that they
[37:45] might have life and that they might have
[37:47] it more abundantly amen amen praise God
[37:51] now two those that are looking at this
[37:55] life they fail to see need the
[37:58] real
[38:00] genuine life that's called eternal life
[38:04] amen amen as long as you look at this
[38:07] world and this real and
[38:11] amen you can't see the Unseen
[38:15] World amen but there's a world that eyes
[38:19] can't see amen amen that's the Unseen
[38:23] the things that are Eternal are unseen
[38:27] amen
[38:29] but you notice that Eve saw the tree of
[38:31] knowledge of Good and Evil and she
[38:37] ate are you with me people are still
[38:41] eating off that
[38:46] tree okay let me go on the knowledge the
[38:51] Unseen
[38:52] Rim the Unseen Rim we live in a world
[38:57] that operates by five senses
[39:00] right
[39:02] see hear taste whatever smell what feel
[39:09] are you with me amen you live in that
[39:12] realm right amen but there's another
[39:15] real we call the six sense not the five
[39:18] cense the six sense which is
[39:21] Faith in Hebrews 11 said faith is the
[39:25] substance of things
[39:28] hopeful it is the evidence of Things
[39:31] noten Not Seen
[39:34] amen Hebrews 11 there and um the one we
[39:40] just read I mean we just quoted but the
[39:43] second verse Hebrews 11 and 2 it went on
[39:47] to say for by
[39:50] faith I mean but for by it the elders
[39:53] attain a good report now the next verse
[39:58] says uh through faith we understand that
[40:01] the what the World by the word God I
[40:05] want you to know something we got to
[40:07] look to the Unseen amen because God did
[40:11] this amen amen by
[40:14] faith but we're so caught up in this
[40:17] world in this
[40:19] Dimension that we're so caught up Amen
[40:23] in in the things that not really real
[40:25] [Music]
[40:28] they're not really
[40:30] real and this is the you know the
[40:34] prophet of God said this is Satan eating
[40:36] amen this is what the devil made amen
[40:40] the make you to the thirst after the The
[40:43] Wanted and desire to have this right
[40:46] here amen took Jesus up on a high
[40:49] mountain said all this will I give to
[40:50] you if showing them all the kingdoms of
[40:53] the
[40:54] world but Jesus wasn't looking at that
[40:56] because he looked to the
[40:59] Unseen why because he knew that my
[41:02] kingdom is not of this
[41:04] world Amen because he knew it was
[41:06] another world the Unseen
[41:09] World amen there's Another Place Another
[41:13] Dimension that he was looking at so you
[41:16] can show me what the five sentence can
[41:19] see but I can look beyond that am amen
[41:22] brothers and sisters we got to look
[41:24] Beyond amen amen that as we were saying
[41:28] look beyond the curtains of time amen
[41:31] and look at eternity what it
[41:33] means
[41:34] amen so here we are looking he said
[41:38] through faith we understand that the
[41:40] world was framed by the word of God it
[41:43] took Faith to bring the world into
[41:44] existence am it took the word of God
[41:48] praise
[41:49] God and so we so that the things which
[41:54] the things which are what seen
[41:59] seen were not made of
[42:04] what the things that do
[42:06] appear praise God the devil would have
[42:10] you to to be caught up in the things
[42:12] that have
[42:14] seen amen but praise God I want to look
[42:17] to how did how did these things get
[42:21] here the things that was are seen got
[42:25] here by faith God said let there be and
[42:30] it
[42:31] was
[42:33] amen the word of God spoken into
[42:38] existence praise God now amen you got to
[42:42] have enough Faith to believe in the
[42:45] Unseen amen the Bible said we walk by
[42:50] faith not by I I got to get there if I
[42:54] can this morning we walk by faith not by
[42:57] s am amen but how can
[43:03] see you know there in in in in our
[43:07] spirit man the five s i mean the five uh
[43:11] things to contact imagination reason
[43:14] conscious and so
[43:16] forth and a lot of times what we
[43:19] imagine praise God I can
[43:23] imagine you know and uh affection how we
[43:27] uh uh folks have a feeling of
[43:31] infection amen
[43:33] memory the devil want you to get caught
[43:36] up but down in the soul it operates on
[43:39] faith a doubt I mean if you doubt God
[43:43] you never see
[43:44] him amen but if you going to see God you
[43:47] got to see him by faith amen but he that
[43:50] cometh to God must believe that he is
[43:53] and that he is the
[43:55] rewarder of them that de see Thomas said
[43:59] except I see him see we all about Sin we
[44:04] we ain't going to believe but we don't
[44:06] see I ain't believing in what I
[44:09] see the lon I see it but believe it is
[44:13] not
[44:14] sin you got to believe God if you don't
[44:17] even see
[44:19] God because the invisible things of God
[44:22] have really seen by the things which are
[44:26] amen
[44:28] but it
[44:30] appear praise God so we don't have to
[44:33] see him to believe him we have to
[44:35] believe in the
[44:37] Sin tell somebody you have to believe
[44:41] the
[44:43] sin not see to believe not but believe
[44:49] to see to see amen are you with me does
[44:54] it make any kind of sense if you don't
[44:56] believe even how you going to see
[44:59] him but he that cometh to God must
[45:02] believe that he is oh
[45:07] Lord we're concerned so much about the
[45:10] carnal and the
[45:12] natural
[45:14] right he said there's no condemnation to
[45:17] them that
[45:19] were that are in Christ Jesus who walk
[45:22] not after the what flesh but after the
[45:26] spirit for the LA of the spirit of life
[45:28] in Christ Jesus has made me free from
[45:31] the law of what s sin and death amen see
[45:36] when uh eve took up the tree of
[45:38] knowledge and good and evil it caused
[45:41] death and it does the day she began to
[45:45] walk by
[45:47] what
[45:48] sight she walked by what sight she saw
[45:53] amen and what we see is what we get
[45:57] somebody said what you see is what you
[45:59] get I'm for
[46:02] real I I'm not putting on what you see
[46:06] is what you get amen praise God I don't
[46:10] want that what I see I don't want to get
[46:13] that what I see I'm real what you see is
[46:16] what you get amen but a lot of people
[46:19] amen realizing that amen you don't see
[46:23] the heart of the person you might see am
[46:26] amen the outside share of what they
[46:29] trying to uh personify amen amen what
[46:34] they trying to get you to know you don't
[46:37] know them amen but they trying to get
[46:40] you to know what they want you to know
[46:44] are you up me because what you see amen
[46:48] you probably find out I ain't I didn't
[46:51] get what I
[46:54] saw amen I got a a somebody that was
[46:58] impersonating
[47:00] yes amen praise God so a lot of
[47:03] Christians are impersonating
[47:05] Christianity they're not really truly
[47:08] from the heart real genuine Christian
[47:11] they say I believe amen the message I
[47:14] believe the word but they don't really
[47:16] believe it because their life amen
[47:20] praise God I said the apple is not the
[47:23] tree but the Apple tell me what kind of
[47:26] tree it is amen amen amen are you with
[47:29] me

[47:41] expecting amen when I bite into the
[47:44] Apple amen the orange juice to come out

[47:51] I'm saying is amen the tree is known by
[47:54] his what fruit fruit
[47:57] praise God you might claim to be a
[48:00] Christian you might say you're a
[48:02] Christian you might say you're a
[48:04] Believer but
[48:07] am pray you got to look at what the word
[48:10] of God says God I believe your word amen
[48:15] I'm not walking by what I feel or what I
[48:18] think or what somebody told me but Lord
[48:21] I walk by faith in your word amen I put
[48:24] my confidence in your word amen amen I'm
[48:27] here amen because the word of God
[48:30] brought me here the life I live I live
