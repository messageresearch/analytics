[31:48] luke 6 and we'll begin at the 17th first

[32:09] you got to say amen and it reads
[32:14] but i say unto you which here
[32:17] love your enemies and do good to them
[32:20] which hate you
[32:21] bless them that curse you and pray for
[32:24] them
[32:25] which despitefully use you and unto him
[32:28] that smiteth thee on one cheek
[32:31] offer also the other and him that taketh
[32:34] away
[32:34] thy cloak forbid not to take away thy
[32:38] coat
[32:38] also you may be seated we'll read
[32:42] a little further down
[32:46] give to every man that asks of thee and
[32:49] of him that taketh away thy goods ask
[32:51] them not again
[32:53] and as you would that men should do
[32:56] to you do ye also to them likewise
[33:00] for if you love them which love you what
[33:03] thank
[33:04] have you what thank have you for sinners
[33:07] also love those that love them
[33:11] and if you do good to them which do good
[33:13] to you well thank have you for sinners
[33:15] also do even the same
[33:17] and if you lend to them of whom
[33:20] you hope to receive what thank have you
[33:23] for sinners also lend
[33:25] to the sinners to receive as much again
[33:28] but love your enemies and do good and
[33:31] lend
[33:32] hoping for nothing again and your reward
[33:35] shall be great
[33:36] and ye shall be the children of the
[33:38] highest for he
[33:40] is kind to unto the unthankful
[33:43] and to the evil but ye therefore be
[33:46] therefore
[33:47] merciful as your father also
[33:50] is merciful let's drop down here to the
[33:53] 46th verse
[33:57] and it reads and why call you you me
[34:00] lord
[34:01] lord and do not the things which i say
[34:04] whosoever come up to me and hears my
[34:07] sayings
[34:08] and do it them i will show you to whom
[34:10] he is like
[34:12] he is like a man was building a house
[34:14] and dig
[34:15] deep and laid the foundation on a rock
[34:18] and when the flood rose and the stream
[34:21] beat
[34:22] vehemently upon the house
[34:25] and could not and could not shake it for
[34:28] it was founded
[34:29] upon iraq but he that heareth and doeth
[34:33] not
[34:34] is like a man that without a foundation
[34:38] built in house
[34:39] upon the earth against which the stream
[34:42] did vehemently beat
[34:43] i mean did beat behemoth vehemently
[34:46] and immediately it failed and the ruin
[34:50] of that house was great may god of the
[34:53] blessed reading of his word
[34:54] tonight by god's grace uh for a short
[34:58] moment
[34:58] i want to speak on a topic and i
[35:01] entitled it foundation
[35:02] amen the foundation you know
[35:06] us ministering here on sunday
[35:09] and how you know is looking at some
[35:11] things and and how
[35:13] you know paul began to talk about
[35:16] you know that we are we are built
[35:20] you know god is using us as a building
[35:23] come on let's look at
[35:24] i'll just turn that ephesians 2 by god's
[35:27] grace
[35:28] ephesians 2
[35:31] and the 19th verse
[35:40] we're talking about foundation tonight
[35:42] ephesians 2 and 19
[35:44] and it says now therefore you are no
[35:46] more strangers than foreigners
[35:48] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[35:51] of the household of god
[35:52] and are built upon the foundation of the
[35:55] apostles and prophets
[35:56] jesus christ himself being the chief
[35:59] cornerstone in whom
[36:01] we all fitly framed together growth unto
[36:03] a holy
[36:05] temple in the lord in whom he also built
[36:08] it together for the habitation
[36:09] of god through the spirit see god
[36:12] he was talking about building a house
[36:15] but it says that we are built upon the
[36:17] foundation of the apostles and the
[36:19] prophets
[36:20] but he says jesus christ himself being
[36:23] the chief cornerstone
[36:24] so you know looking at it the house
[36:27] ain't nothing without christ
[36:30] the with without him being the chief
[36:32] cornerstone
[36:33] come on the house of fall you know i was
[36:35] sharing with the church the other day
[36:37] i said you know when we're looking at it
[36:40] even here in ephesians 2
[36:42] it talks about you can go home and read
[36:43] it in your spare time it talks about
[36:46] grace
[36:46] and the grace that god has given us and
[36:49] how we are saved by grace
[36:51] and not of works lest any man should
[36:53] boast
[36:54] so many times we look at the works and
[36:57] the things
[36:58] that we achieve and the things that we
[37:01] may have done in this life
[37:03] but nevertheless you know we're not
[37:05] saved by those things
[37:07] but we're saved by the grace of god the
[37:10] bible said we're with the love that he
[37:12] loved us
[37:13] so everything that we are and all that
[37:16] we
[37:17] can become even tonight it's only
[37:19] because of him
[37:21] that's where it starts at the building
[37:24] must start with him
[37:25] you know it says that you know before a
[37:27] person come to god
[37:30] they they should come to god under no
[37:32] unders no other circumstances
[37:34] other than recognizing that they are
[37:37] lost and they need a savior
[37:39] you know sometimes people say well i
[37:41] just gave my life to the lord just to
[37:43] turn a new leaf for
[37:44] or i game because you know i know it's
[37:47] the right thing to do
[37:48] well when you do it that way you know
[37:50] that ain't even starting out right
[37:52] come on so you know even when we're
[37:55] talking about building a house
[37:57] that house you can't start from the roof
[37:59] like i said many times you can't stop
[38:01] from the roof down but you got to start
[38:04] from the bottom up
[38:05] come on and the foundation is the most
[38:08] important part of the structure
[38:10] so if the foundation ain't laid right
[38:12] you find that
[38:14] you many times we see people they run
[38:16] for a long time
[38:18] maybe for years and years and then all
[38:21] of a sudden something happened
[38:24] and it and it and it uh uh knocks them
[38:27] out
[38:27] come on but nevertheless i like how
[38:30] jesus and i know i may get ahead of
[38:31] myself
[38:32] was here speaking about you know the
[38:35] foundation
[38:36] gotta be right jesus speaking on that he
[38:40] says
[38:40] i'ma tell you and he's beginning to talk
[38:42] about certain things
[38:44] he says that i tell you he that heareth
[38:47] my sins and do them
[38:48] he said i'ma tell you what that man is
[38:50] like
[38:51] he said that man is is like the one who
[38:54] dug
[38:54] deep come on and he dug deep
[38:57] until he found a rock and that's what he
[39:00] started building on
[39:02] he says but and then when the when the
[39:04] winds or we
[39:05] just paraphrase it when the floods came
[39:08] and the winds
[39:09] began to blow and all that i like the
[39:11] terminology he used
[39:13] he said that it couldn't shake the house
[39:15] because it was built
[39:17] on on a rock come on and i looked at
[39:20] that
[39:21] even you know i was looking at last week
[39:23] we had a storm
[39:24] so bad that's where i get a lot of the
[39:27] sermon from a week for last
[39:28] it was a storm so bad it was rain and
[39:31] down pouring
[39:32] the wind was blowing looked like it was
[39:34] going to shake the whole car
[39:36] and turn it upside down but nevertheless
[39:39] you know being in that it was only a
[39:41] little while later
[39:42] and then the rain already let up and the
[39:44] sun was already out come on
[39:46] and i says that you know just uh
[39:49] relating it
[39:50] to our life you know we in times we hit
[39:53] those times
[39:54] where the wind's going to blow come on
[39:57] where the rains are going to fall
[39:59] where the the the life itself
[40:02] seemed to be turning you upside down
[40:06] so jesus wants to prepare us for those
[40:09] times
[40:10] he gives us his word he gives us
[40:13] instructions
[40:14] on how to build a house come on on how
[40:17] to start because he knows that
[40:19] when you in this life storm's going to
[40:21] come
[40:22] flood's going to come and all those
[40:23] things he says but i'm going to tell you
[40:25] how to make it through that how many
[40:27] believe that tonight
[40:28] so we find that i says what it is you
[40:31] know jesus says
[40:33] he that keeps my sin i read that even in
[40:35] the beginning because
[40:37] i even like how when we talked about the
[40:39] beatitudes and things and
[40:41] how jesus gave us certain things that we
[40:44] ought to govern our lives by he said to
[40:47] for once he said to love your enemies
[40:50] come on
[40:51] and to bless them that curse you you
[40:54] know
[40:54] in the hour that we live in in the time
[40:57] that we live in that's almost
[40:59] uh uh one of the sins that people would
[41:01] laugh at today
[41:02] in the world that we live in today how
[41:04] can you live that way
[41:06] well you within yourself you can't live
[41:08] that way
[41:09] that's why you got to dig deep
[41:11] hallelujah
[41:13] you got to get down on your knees and
[41:14] dig deep
[41:16] dig deep until you hit a rock until you
[41:19] find
[41:20] that place in youtu no more about you
[41:24] just like jesus when he was in
[41:25] gethsemane and
[41:27] and praying the bible said he prayed
[41:29] unto us i believe sweat was like blood
[41:31] he said lord if it be thy will let this
[41:34] cup pass from me
[41:36] but then i believe he dug deep enough
[41:38] come on
[41:39] they hit a rock and he said lord not my
[41:42] will
[41:42] but thy will let it be done get into
[41:45] that place
[41:46] within ourselves to we're not even
[41:48] looking at ourselves
[41:50] but we dug deep enough you know i was
[41:52] praying today
[41:53] and i said lord you know our our whole
[41:57] main objective and our whole goal
[42:01] is to make the kingdom come on you know
[42:04] you know he asked once he says you know
[42:06] he says what is the greatest commandment
[42:08] and they begin to tell him
[42:09] he says the love of thy lord god with
[42:11] all that heart with all that mind
[42:13] with all that soul and he began to tell
[42:14] him that yes that's the truth he says
[42:16] but you miss one come on
[42:18] he says you know he began to talk about
[42:21] certain things
[42:22] that we uh uh don't look at ourselves
[42:26] come on
[42:27] but we begin to look at the well-being
[42:30] of others how many believe that tonight
[42:32] so we're talking about like i said a
[42:34] foundation
[42:36] finding you know uh what
[42:39] what is going to keep us
[42:42] when the storm is raging what's going to
[42:46] keep you when the storm is raging
[42:48] you know you within yourself you will
[42:51] fall
[42:52] i like how david as i was ministering a
[42:55] couple weeks ago
[42:56] on david said i believed and therefore
[43:00] have i spoken
[43:02] thou kept thou has kept my feet from
[43:04] falling
[43:05] we we believe even an hour that we live
[43:08] in come on
[43:10] that what's going to keep us nothing but
[43:12] the power of god
[43:14] i believe that's what the bible says
[43:15] that we are kept by what
[43:17] by the power of god when we look at this
[43:21] life
[43:21] come on in the storms and the floods and
[43:24] the things
[43:25] beaten so very humanly you say how did
[43:28] you make it come on
[43:29] because i was founded on a rock and that
[43:32] rock had power in it
[43:34] to do what to keep me in the midst of
[43:36] what was going through
[43:38] how did your mind stay stable
[43:41] because when i did all i could do all i
[43:44] did was stand hallelujah
[43:46] i like how jesus said that and i'll say
[43:48] it again he says that
[43:50] that though when it beat up against the
[43:52] house it couldn't shake
[43:54] it come on you shouldn't let nothing
[43:56] shouldn't be able to shake you come on
[43:58] you might get startled a little bit but
[44:01] when you when you grab yourself come on
[44:03] when you get hold of of the situation
[44:06] when you grab yourself and
[44:08] realize come on that the battle ain't
[44:10] mine but the battle is the lord's how
[44:12] many believe that tonight
[44:13] so we find that i says the foundation
[44:16] you know
[44:17] sometimes we got to go and examine
[44:20] you know go back and inspect and over
[44:23] do another like we say an inspection
[44:25] over our life
[44:26] what it is like i said down at the cross
[44:29] at the cross
[44:30] where i first saw the light come on and
[44:32] the burns of my heart rolled away
[44:35] it was there by faith i received my
[44:37] sight and now
[44:38] i'm happy all the day come on where did
[44:41] you see that light
[44:42] was it at the cross come on or was it
[44:45] just in some social gathering
[44:47] or something just feeling good moment
[44:49] but did you
[44:50] did you uh journey to the cross yet to
[44:53] that place to where you saw yourself
[44:56] as wretched and undone come on i like
[44:59] how the bible says
[45:00] and when you read in ephesians 2 it says
[45:03] that
[45:04] we at one point in our lives when paul
[45:07] was talking to him and explaining to him
[45:09] that it wasn't your
[45:10] your effort in anything you've done but
[45:12] it was god and god alone
[45:14] he began to explain to them he says you
[45:16] were strangers
[45:18] you were outside of outside of hope come
[45:21] on
[45:22] it says that you were in the world
[45:24] without god
[45:25] come on and i think about that i says
[45:27] lord
[45:28] how miserable uh creatures we were
[45:32] in the world without god come on
[45:35] you know i was i was sharing with them
[45:37] the other day i said that you know
[45:39] my testimony is that i i wouldn't be
[45:42] where i
[45:43] am today if it wasn't for the lord come
[45:45] on
[45:46] and i heard somebody say i made it this
[45:48] forward adam come on
[45:50] but they said that in ignorance because
[45:53] you can't do nothing without them come
[45:55] on
[45:55] he even said in one place i'm the vine
[45:58] come on and you are the branches
[46:00] don't you know that the life is in the
[46:02] vine if god was to cut you off you
[46:05] wouldn't be nothing today
[46:06] what can you brag about come on he said
[46:09] it's not a works
[46:10] lest any man should boast god i got
[46:13] nothing to brag about
[46:14] all of my glory and i'm going to glory
[46:16] in thee lord
[46:18] in all of my lifting you said if i be
[46:20] lifted up come on
[46:21] then i'll draw men unto me come on what
[46:24] we ought to do today
[46:26] is continue to lift the name of jesus up
[46:28] because he's still drawn
[46:30] he's still pulling he's still living
[46:32] he's still delivering
[46:34] living he's still delivering today how
[46:35] many believe that
[46:38] you know but what it is like i like that
[46:40] he says to keep my sins
[46:42] come on you know how we live in an hour
[46:44] where it's hard to keep his sins
[46:47] to those that aren't born again come on
[46:50] that's why
[46:50] it's important for the need the need of
[46:52] the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:55] because what he is the teacher when he
[46:57] comes inside even
[46:59] when your feet would fall he would keep
[47:01] you from falling
[47:03] when you want to slide he would keep you
[47:05] from sliding
[47:06] he comes to your mind all the time and
[47:09] he says quit you like men hallelujah
[47:12] my thoughts are not your thoughts my
[47:14] ways are not your ways
[47:16] lord but they did me this way i say love
[47:18] your enemies
[47:20] i say bless them that curse you come on
[47:22] i'm teaching you
[47:24] what's going to keep you in the long run
[47:26] i'm teaching you what's going to help
[47:27] you
[47:28] hallelujah how you how to build upon the
[47:30] right foundation how many believe that
[47:33] but what it is you know that's what it
[47:36] is
[47:36] many many times we come to christ we
[47:38] don't believe that our foundation is
[47:40] going to be tried
[47:42] we don't realize sometimes or we think
[47:45] just a little test come and that's it
[47:46] come on
[47:47] but the showdown is coming come on the
[47:50] fire
[47:51] will fall come on but he'll suffer you
[47:54] not to be consumed
[47:56] why because he is that consuming fire
[47:59] how many believe that tonight
[48:01] he is that living god and i thank god
[48:04] for that that's why
[48:05] we look to the unseen come on we look to
[48:08] the things that we can't see
[48:10] i don't know about you tonight but you
[48:12] look at this world
[48:14] these carnal things they fade so fast
[48:18] things are happening so quick like they
[48:20] say life is like a vapor
[48:21] here today and gone tomorrow but
[48:24] nevertheless
[48:24] that's why we strive we're striving as i
[48:27] was praying today we're striving for the
[48:29] kingdom of god
[48:30] lord we're striving for that kingdom we
[48:33] can't rest
[48:34] our feet can't rest until we find our
[48:37] place
[48:37] ourselves in our place in you lord our
[48:40] feet can't
[48:41] rest until we find our our part in the
[48:44] building come on
[48:46] you know paul says that you know we are
[48:49] we are
[48:49] a building we're a makeup of the house
[48:52] of god come on
[48:53] fitly frame together don't you know when
[48:55] you're talking about
[48:56] being fitted come on that means that
[48:59] nobody can't take your place
[49:02] you got a certain part you got to play
[49:04] come on you got a place
[49:06] in the building and without you the
[49:08] building ain't going to be complete come
[49:09] on
[49:10] so we can't try to fit ourselves in some
[49:13] other place
[49:14] but that's why we come to god and say
[49:16] lord not what i want to do but lord
[49:18] what will you have me to do i got goals
[49:21] and
[49:22] i got ambitions but i want to find my
[49:24] place in the building guard
[49:26] wherever it is god i want to find my
[49:28] place in the building
[49:29] how many want to find their place in the
[49:31] building and that's what it is
[49:33] finding uh uh uh your place but you know
[49:37] like we said the foundation we know that
[49:39] i says
[49:40] uh the foundation got to be right come
[49:42] on you know
[49:44] one of the one of the most mis
[49:47] ingredients
[49:48] that we'll say out of the foundation is
[49:51] repentance come on
[49:53] people don't like to repent
[49:56] the take the blame lord it's me god i'm
[50:00] sorry
[50:02] help me come on we don't like to say
[50:05] that sometimes
[50:06] when we know deep down in ourselves
[50:10] that we need god's help deep within
[50:13] ourselves
[50:14] that we're wrong and need god's help
[50:18] but pride sometimes won't let us get
[50:20] that law
[50:22] pride sometimes keep us from crying out
[50:25] to god for help
[50:27] but we get to those places sometimes
[50:31] where we're shaking i believe stanson
[50:34] got to that place
[50:35] the way pride it was done away with then
[50:37] come on
[50:38] his eyes were plucked out he was weak
[50:42] like every other man and everybody
[50:45] making fun of him
[50:46] i believe pride went out the window then
[50:48] didn't it come on
[50:50] then he could cry out lord have mercy on
[50:54] me
[50:57] forgive me i'll wrong you lord i've done
[51:00] wrong
[51:01] lord forgive me and and revive me lord
[51:04] come on
[51:05] renew my strength just this once more
[51:07] lord
[51:08] i'll obey you now hallelujah how many
[51:12] feel like letting go tonight come on
[51:14] but i says that's one most important i
[51:17] would say that
[51:18] ingredient out of out of the foundation
[51:21] coming to god
[51:22] with a repentant heart as we said no man
[51:24] should come to god under any other
[51:25] circumstances than recognizing
[51:27] that he's lost and he need a savior i
[51:29] don't care how good you've been
[51:32] what family you from come on what life
[51:36] you live what great works you've done
[51:39] then jesus said there'd be many on that
[51:41] day
[51:42] that said lord didn't we do great things
[51:44] in your name
[51:45] he said i'll say it apart from you
[51:46] workers of iniquity come on you that
[51:48] were connectedly i didn't
[51:50] even know you come on but it'll be those
[51:53] that recognize who they are come on
[51:56] recognize
[51:57] the condition of the life they're in and
[51:59] they say lord i need your help
[52:02] come on finding that i said the
[52:04] foundation
[52:05] you know storms going blow come on
[52:07] wind's gonna blow
[52:09] floods rain is gonna fall are you built
[52:11] on the right foundation tonight
[52:14] centering around what jesus christ and
[52:18] him alone
[52:19] no great church building as they say
[52:22] organization all these things but you
[52:24] built on christ
[52:26] come on on christ like they say the
[52:29] solid rock i stand
[52:31] no other ground all other ground i mean
[52:34] is shaking sand
[52:35] come on do you believe that tonight he
[52:38] says the one that don't
[52:40] that hears my sins and don't do them he
[52:42] said i'll show you what that man
[52:43] is like he said he's the man that build
[52:46] his house
[52:47] without a foundation just building
[52:50] on the quicksands when the winds blow
[52:54] you might make it past the first storm
[52:56] but when the next storm come
[52:58] it'll knock you out come on i said lord
[53:01] i want to be built right
[53:02] how many want to be built right tonight
[53:04] i said lord
[53:05] let me be built right let me get back to
[53:08] that place
[53:09] you know and that's what we desire to
[53:11] see to a place
[53:13] to where the people are broken come on
[53:16] to a broken and a contrite spirit to
[53:19] that one that come to the lord he said i
[53:21] will in no wise
[53:22] cast away didn't he say that i won't
[53:24] turn that one down
[53:26] come on because they come in right they
[53:29] broken
[53:30] they realize it i'm lost i need a savior
[53:34] hallelujah god save me
[53:37] i need your help how many need god's
[53:39] help tonight
[53:41] but he's talking about coming there you
[53:43] know broken he says i'll
[53:45] all i know wise turn that man down i
[53:47] want to say tonight
[53:48] come on the foundation i ask you the
[53:51] question
[53:52] is your foundation built right tonight
[53:54] come on we find that
[53:56] you know sometimes what do the storms do
[54:00] sometimes the storms they bring out
[54:03] imperfections in our lives
[54:05] they bring out things or just like jesus
[54:08] said you know
[54:09] love your enemies and all this you know
[54:11] these things they come to do what to try
[54:14] you don't they
[54:15] these situations saying they come to try
[54:17] you and a lot of times
[54:19] they bring out things in you the
[54:21] imperfections
[54:23] they show you the imperfections in your
[54:25] life
[54:26] that you can go back and work on them
[54:28] hallelujah
[54:29] you can go back and see where you left
[54:31] some doors open
[54:33] now these doors got to be closed
[54:37] and i can't stand at the door but i need
[54:40] the door here
[54:40] jesus said i am the door come on i need
[54:43] him to be the door
[54:45] i need god to watch those gates
[54:48] hallelujah
[54:49] that the wicked one might not come in in
[54:52] the night
[54:52] and destroy me hallelujah but in the
[54:55] middle of the night come on
[54:58] in the middle of the darkness even where
[55:00] we live at right now
[55:02] jesus is the door come on watching over
[55:05] us
[55:06] while we lay down at night how did i
[55:08] make it through the night
[55:10] because jesus was at the gate jesus
[55:13] was at the door he was the door
[55:15] hallelujah
[55:16] and he suffered not the enemy to come in
[55:18] and take me oh
[55:20] jesus how did you make it through the
[55:22] night it was only by the grace of god
[55:24] how did you make it through when the
[55:26] wolves were out there
[55:28] the demon powers in the darkness the
[55:30] wickedness in hot places
[55:32] how did they get pulled down hallelujah
[55:36] we were mighty through god hallelujah
[55:39] into pulling down the strongholds that's
[55:42] what it was
[55:43] god helped us pull those strongholds
[55:45] down the devil
[55:47] had fortifications and all these things
[55:49] against you
[55:50] but here come jesus help you to pull
[55:52] them down here come jesus
[55:54] making the way somebody said he made a
[55:56] way again hallelujah
[55:58] somebody said he showed up again what it
[56:00] was
[56:01] jesus the whole time doing these things
[56:04] hallelujah how many thank god for that
[56:06] tonight
[56:08] i said the foundation come on that's why
[56:11] i said we examine ourselves
[56:12] we forget certain things he says to keep
[56:15] my sins we forget certain things
[56:17] we leave off sometimes certain
[56:20] principles
[56:21] don't we and when the storm come
[56:24] i believe that we find ourselves not
[56:27] being able to stand
[56:28] as we ought to come on men out to pray
[56:31] always
[56:32] ain't that what the bible say come on we
[56:35] forget
[56:36] those things don't we and when the storm
[56:39] blow we wonder why
