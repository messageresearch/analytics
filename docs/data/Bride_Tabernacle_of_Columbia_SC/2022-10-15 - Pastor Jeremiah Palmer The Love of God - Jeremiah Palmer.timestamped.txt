[35:46] second
[35:48] First Peter 1 excuse me
[36:01] one in 22.
[36:19] a little something we shared back at
[36:21] home there and Sunday School
[36:24] from a different angle tonight in Jesus
[36:26] name
[36:27] one First Peter 1 and 22 it says
[36:32] seeing you have purified your heart you
[36:35] purify your souls
[36:37] in obeying the truth through the spirit
[36:41] unto unfaged love of the brethren
[36:45] see that you love one another with a
[36:48] pure heart fervently
[36:50] being born again not a corruptible seed
[36:54] but of incorrupt but by the word of God
[36:56] or to liveth and abideth forever father
[37:00] we ask you to bless the word tonight in
[37:03] Jesus name amen let me be seated
[37:12] also I want to turn also to the book of
[37:16] um Saint John 33 but I want to come back
[37:18] to First Peter Saint John
[37:33] Saint John 33
[37:35] excuse Saint John
[37:38] 13.
[37:39] every one of the moments of you huh
[37:45] Saint John 13.
[37:50] and 34.
[37:54] a new commandment I give unto you
[37:58] that you love one another
[38:00] as I have loved you
[38:02] that ye also love one another
[38:06] by this shall all men know
[38:09] that you're my disciples if ye have love
[38:12] one to another amen
[38:16] I'm gonna go back to First Peter
[38:18] 1 and 22.
[38:22] I want to maybe for a few minutes
[38:25] tonight try to
[38:28] which you know you never can
[38:31] explain the love of God
[38:35] because it's
[38:37] Eternal it's
[38:38] much deeper than what we even can
[38:42] imagine with our little finite brain
[38:46] to really Express what the love of God
[38:49] really is all about
[38:51] I believe in scripture said for God so
[38:54] loved the world that he gave his only
[38:57] begotten son
[39:00] but I want to speak a little bit on
[39:02] unfeigned love
[39:04] unfeigned love or the love of God I just
[39:06] title it when that word unfainted mean
[39:09] not hypocritical
[39:13] is genuine
[39:16] we like to say in our term let it be
[39:19] real
[39:22] sister to sing the song whatever you do
[39:24] for Jesus let it be real
[39:29] let our love be real
[39:32] as he said here one for another
[39:37] the love of God it constrains you
[39:44] to go an extra mile
[39:49] for someone
[39:53] not so much to say that as we like to
[39:57] call it in our ranks
[40:01] I like to use the terminology but the
[40:03] love of God goes outside of our box
[40:09] it even goes outside of our churches
[40:14] one place they say what good of you to
[40:17] love them that love you don't the public
[40:18] in the same
[40:22] but the love of God if he did for each
[40:25] and every one of us
[40:27] in spite of what and where we were and
[40:31] what we were doing God love went beyond
[40:34] that
[40:38] you know and I know myself we were in a
[40:40] horrible condition foreign
[40:44] they didn't even deserve the mercy and
[40:48] the grace of God that he had upon us
[40:53] but and he liked to say sometimes uh God
[40:56] go way down
[40:59] and pick us up
[41:03] I like about the love of God because uh
[41:08] as people look at it and how they label
[41:13] it
[41:15] you know you have the goody good people
[41:19] you know and the good of good people
[41:21] love other good and good people
[41:24] but that wasn't Jesus approach
[41:29] he went beyond and went to those that
[41:33] are without
[41:37] no hope
[41:40] per se amen
[41:42] amen the Castile
[41:44] the ridicued
[41:47] one that life that was so messed up
[41:53] they could not reconcile themselves back
[41:57] but God did
[42:02] I like that you know and you know
[42:06] I guess you know
[42:11] your life that we live and where we came
[42:14] from and we all can testify that we
[42:19] shouldn't be where we are tonight
[42:23] but it was God's grace
[42:28] and I wonder sometimes can we extend
[42:31] that Grace to somebody else
[42:36] that when God found you you weren't the
[42:39] good person
[42:45] find the rejected the one even sometime
[42:49] that our own family didn't want to have
[42:52] nothing to do with us
[42:55] you were like me you made a family name
[42:58] a shame
[43:01] because of how you turn out
[43:07] but it wasn't over there
[43:12] God began to move in our lives and God
[43:16] began to turn your life around
[43:24] one thing I learned if you put your
[43:25] trust in people you in bad shape
[43:31] and sometimes God let it get that low
[43:36] the way even you yourself give up hope
[43:42] but God didn't give up on you
[43:46] God knew the right time to the right
[43:50] place
[43:52] that he was going to begin to turn
[43:55] your life around
[44:00] someone said God let it get so messed up
[44:03] that you couldn't even fix it
[44:09] that's what I'll tell people a lot of
[44:11] time don't judge nothing before the time
[44:17] because God ain't through yet
[44:22] the worst one or the worst situation
[44:24] that may look bad now but remember God
[44:28] got the last say so
[44:34] here Paul
[44:37] a Peter
[44:39] was seen a scene that you have purified
[44:41] your heart your souls
[44:44] in obeying the truth
[44:48] through the spirit until unfeigned love
[44:52] of the brethren
[44:55] he says see that you love one another
[44:57] with a pure heart
[45:02] that's what God wants us to love with a
[45:05] pure heart
[45:07] not on conditions
[45:12] not having respectable or person because
[45:16] what they drive what they wear where
[45:19] they live
[45:22] it goes beyond those things it goes way
[45:26] deep
[45:31] this I guess the terminology that people
[45:33] love to use and it's all here you know
[45:36] when they uh look at things sometimes
[45:39] they tell oh brother that was deep let
[45:41] me tell you what's deep
[45:43] the love of God when it's pure in your
[45:45] heart
[45:47] hmm the love of God is not selfish
[45:52] in other words it's not about you it's
[45:54] about somebody else
[45:57] is that what Jesus did
[46:00] he laid his life down not for himself
[46:03] but he laid it down for us
[46:07] [Music]
[46:10] I think about that soon the sister don't
[46:13] say that that make me want to shout
[46:14] right there
[46:17] deep
[46:20] you want a deep mystery
[46:22] the pure love of God in your heart
[46:27] the circle of God said that's what the
[46:29] world is looking for the real love of
[46:33] God
[46:35] not because of your church affiliate
[46:39] you a deacon and you're a preacher or
[46:41] whatever you are no no no no beyond that
[46:49] God didn't categorize us
[46:53] in sections you know
[46:57] like the people trying to do today try
[46:59] to put you in sections
[47:01] no God law loves uh one of the purpose
[47:04] that that Avail was ripped he tore down
[47:08] the middle wall
[47:10] he told down every barrier
[47:15] [Music]
[47:17] up and he went beyond the camp
[47:25] they're using this in a Sunday School
[47:28] from a different angle though we took it
[47:30] from the book of First Corinthians 13
[47:33] how Paul you know was saying that though
[47:35] I give my body to be burned you know and
[47:38] do I can uh move mountains I know all
[47:41] the Mysteries and have all knowledge he
[47:44] said but if I have charity don't have
[47:46] charity it profit me nothing
[47:51] they know all the Mysteries
[47:54] give your body to be burned
[47:58] pay all the money in the church and have
[48:01] not charged
[48:07] see the love of God
[48:11] the love there's healing evening love
[48:18] but it has to be real
[48:21] it can't be one-sided
[48:27] we see that a lot on one side of it
[48:31] but no that won't work God not looking
[48:34] for that kind of one-sidedness
[48:37] God wants you to love them that don't
[48:40] even love you
[48:45] you said by this
[48:47] they'll know you are my disciples when
[48:50] you get in love
[48:53] love like I love
[48:57] you come on somebody don't love like the
[49:00] Church of the preacher a discipline they
[49:02] know Love Like Jesus love
[49:07] his love go out
[49:10] sometime of your way and reach out to
[49:13] somebody who nobody else wanna fool with
[49:20] everybody else walked by and shake their
[49:22] head and
[49:24] you see that person
[49:27] you see how they look you see you forget
[49:31] how you were
[49:34] sometimes I believe you know a lot of
[49:36] times you know I just think especially I
[49:39] get a chance to go back home you know I
[49:41] circled the little block and all that I
[49:43] used to live and we asked to hang out at
[49:46] and all I can do when I grew up in I
[49:48] said Lord thank you amen
[49:50] I say because I could have been dead
[49:53] right here
[49:55] you know I should have been
[49:58] gone right here
[50:01] but God is saying when I think back over
[50:05] my life
[50:10] so I got a testimony
[50:13] what's your attachable God has been good
[50:17] to you
[50:20] somebody said even better than you then
[50:22] you've been to your own self
[50:27] we were self-destructed people
[50:30] people killing our own self
[50:34] but God brings in his Mercy said no
[50:42] oh my
[50:46] God I believe it's the love of God Is
[50:48] Right
[50:49] is the love of God is right in our
[50:53] hearts tonight when ought to be illegal
[50:59] but it's
[51:01] all
[51:02] is really you were here in our soul a
[51:07] demon to be cast
[51:11] love does that
[51:13] not gifts propaganda I'd Rather Have
[51:16] Love in the church with no gifts
[51:20] oh that ain't the message there isn't it
[51:24] you go beyond the quotations
[51:27] we're looking for realities
[51:31] not just saying that one said the Lord
[51:34] let their love of God be so real in us
[51:38] that people know you in their men
[51:43] and when God is there sister brother
[51:46] demons
[51:53] but it got to be there
[51:56] you can't fake it
[51:59] no either don't fake it till you make it
[52:01] you got to have it
[52:04] and God has to give it to you
[52:07] amen property he said uh when the son of
[52:10] the Holy Ghost is the love of God
[52:15] you say you received the Holy Ghost did
[52:17] the love of God ought to be so in your
[52:20] heart that where you
[52:25] you to the unsavable
[52:29] oh my
[52:32] God I I just I try to you really bet
[52:36] this back home you know I sit back home
[52:38] at the church there that you know
[52:40] regardless of how people come into the
[52:43] church doors and I would say I say don't
[52:45] you bother them
[52:49] they dress don't don't you bother that
[52:52] let God do the work
[52:56] let God do what he's supposed to do we
[52:59] just love him
[53:03] look up people coming like we thinking
[53:06] you know they're not just properly they
[53:09] don't know the things that you know
[53:11] sometimes we get a little you know uh I
[53:14] beat one place in the Bible it's saying
[53:16] for a man come in your church with a
[53:17] goal apparel you say I'm up front
[53:22] in the Amen Corner
[53:25] but that better come in here you
[53:28] go back to everybody
[53:31] he said no
[53:34] we must not do that we must understand
[53:36] it could be an angel unaware
[53:41] you can be entertaining an angel and
[53:44] they may be dressed like a bomb and just
[53:46] like and talking crazy but then God has
[53:50] a word for you
[53:52] your angel came
[53:55] dressed
[53:58] not like a saint
[54:01] God can disguise himself
[54:06] it already looking man that don't look
[54:09] like much but yet he was an angel
[54:14] how many of them met people so strangely
[54:17] who you never ever saw before when they
[54:20] pop up in YouTube and then they gone
[54:24] they said what was that people the
[54:27] earnest they had something like that to
[54:28] happen
[54:29] look for the man nowhere to be found
[54:31] where did he go
[54:33] step into the Angel that's visiting him
[54:37] he had a world he didn't look like much
[54:39] did it so did Jesus
[54:41] Bible said there was no Beauty
[54:45] inside he didn't look like much
[54:49] he didn't dress like the king and the
[54:51] partners and the rose and the gold and
[54:54] all he came looking ragged
[54:58] yet he was God In the Flesh
[55:02] to do what to reconcile the world back
[55:05] to God again
[55:07] through humility through his love and he
[55:12] demonstrated his love for the time
[55:16] let alone the words over he had Deeds
[55:20] see he loved or makes you do something
[55:25] it has worked
[55:32] if I can find this
[55:40] Matthew 5.
[55:47] you know I'm I'm learning
[55:50] you know I thought about something
[55:54] you know is at the little
[55:58] and I do appreciate you know
[56:01] uh Matthew 5.
[56:10] remember the years back
[56:14] you know in my family double a little
[56:16] puzzle
[56:19] you know as Brother Gibson and the Seven
[56:22] of those brother Isaiah
[56:24] those way back in the early in the 80s
[56:27] the late 80s
[56:29] 89 and
[56:32] and how they used to come
[56:35] uh from mullen's way to Manning to pick
[56:38] me up for church
[56:41] and they questioned me why are they
[56:43] coming so far
[56:45] why you have to go way down there
[56:52] and my answer was to them that right now
[56:58] you don't when they know what's going on
[57:03] and they wouldn't take not one dime from
[57:06] me they would not want me to do anything
[57:07] to give them a return anything of that
[57:11] nature you know and I'm a man like this
[57:13] you know I don't say much about certain
[57:15] things I just look
[57:17] and I watch
[57:21] you know but what really got me that I
[57:23] saw a difference
[57:26] and I grew up in a Christian home you
[57:28] know in church and you know the speaking
[57:31] in tongues and the shouting and the
[57:32] music and all of that you know but this
[57:34] was beyond that
[57:38] I saw something that was real
[57:42] and it wasn't what so much of what did
[57:44] was they said to me because it really
[57:47] didn't talk a whole lot about anything
[57:49] about how you're doing stuff like that
[57:51] but they didn't we didn't say anything
[57:52] about the message or anything like that
[57:54] but there was something a distinction
[57:57] that that there was a care a genuine
[58:03] a genuine list
[58:06] they go now that we know much better
[58:09] that in the Christian realm you really
[58:12] have some mean folks
[58:16] I mean me in the name of Jesus
[58:21] and the people feel that that ain't you
[58:24] know it ain't real
[58:27] and sometimes they'll just says that's
[58:29] what you call uh well you got I I don't
[58:33] I keep what I got because they see the
[58:36] parallel of you and them is the same
[58:38] [Music]
[58:40] so they are
[58:45] and the difference is not what we talk
[58:47] about amen
[58:48] but in what you have in here
[58:53] and it must be real it can't be fake I
[58:57] know we'll deal with that a lot in a lot
[59:00] of years but when the people wasn't
[59:02] fooled by
[59:07] but they can tell in real love
[59:09] when somebody care about me and not
[59:13] about what I can give
[59:17] at the church where they were telling
[59:20] um young couple another last week of the
[59:24] week the Lord blessed that we we baptize
[59:27] a husband and a wife there the name of
[59:29] the Lord Jesus Christ out of front just
[59:31] coming off the street really not knowing
[59:34] much about God and the Lord blessed they
[59:36] came to the service gave their life to
[59:38] God and we baptized them in the name of
[59:40] the Lord Jesus Christ on last Thursday
[59:42] but it's something you know about them
[59:44] you know that when they uh saw some
[59:47] things especially the sister
[59:52] immersed the question of a question and
[59:55] she wanted to know she said well what
[59:57] about them pants bro
[1:00:00] I said what about him
[1:00:03] she said is that okay I said well let's
[1:00:06] see what the Bible say about it
[1:00:08] and also had one of the little tracks
[1:00:11] there with me in the Bible on the dress
[1:00:13] code and
[1:00:14] we came to a house for the study then
[1:00:17] she said oh brother
[1:00:19] she said I see that thing so I got to
[1:00:22] get rid of these things
[1:00:25] I was not gonna tell her for sake
[1:00:30] but I just knew that her heart was right
[1:00:33] with God then God are you sure
[1:00:39] and when you get it that way that God
[1:00:42] revealed it to you and he show you and
[1:00:45] give you an understanding hey I
[1:00:47] shouldn't be doing this
[1:00:49] then you can't say your brother John box
[1:00:51] having on do it about 77 no no no no no
[1:00:55] God words say
[1:00:58] then when you become a witness you can
[1:01:00] see let me show you what the Bible said
[1:01:02] because too many times we do things
[1:01:05] because the preachers say it or this
[1:01:08] will say it but if you see it already in
[1:01:10] the word and in the Holy Ghost tell you
[1:01:12] you shouldn't do that
[1:01:14] it's a difference
[1:01:18] because I'm going to tell you something
[1:01:19] if a man can put you in it he can take
[1:01:22] you out
[1:01:24] but when God give it to you
[1:01:26] I said when God give it to you no devil
[1:01:30] out of hell
[1:01:33] see that's why the love of God see
[1:01:36] because you love God in your heart and
[1:01:39] you want to do that which is right
[1:01:42] you don't want to do anything you know
[1:01:44] to hurt him
[1:01:46] just please him in other words
[1:01:49] because your love is right
[1:01:53] like a man say your love is the wife and
[1:01:55] he's cheating on the he don't really
[1:01:56] love her
[1:01:58] your lover can scream you I don't want
[1:02:01] to do nothing to hurt my wife
[1:02:06] because your heart is pure
[1:02:09] your love is genuine
[1:02:13] you know you don't want to see no harm
[1:02:14] come to you no kind of way
[1:02:18] so you try to you know abstain from evil
[1:02:22] keep yourself separated from the things
[1:02:25] that's going to contaminate you
[1:02:29] all type of foolishes you name a
[1:02:32] religion that's one of the biggest
[1:02:33] Destroyer the people that's religion
[1:02:38] silver Garcia to send more people to
[1:02:41] Hell than the bootleg joint
[1:02:46] good religion
[1:02:48] is fake leaves
[1:02:51] I said Matthew didn't know
[1:02:55] Matthew 5.
[1:02:58] 44.
[1:03:04] yes
[1:03:05] Matthew 5 and 44 said but I say unto you
[1:03:10] love your buddies
[1:03:15] love your enemies oh my
[1:03:20] bless them that do what
[1:03:24] I had an incident and I hope I can say
[1:03:28] this in the right respectable way at uh
[1:03:33] we were teaching on the Statue of a
[1:03:35] perfect man
[1:03:36] you know you'll speak on certain things
[1:03:39] and told you the devil come and test you
[1:03:43] and I spoke on special perfect man some
[1:03:46] things and went to the store next door
[1:03:49] and a lady was there you know
[1:03:51] intoxicated heard another lady you know
[1:03:55] been looking kind of wild and really
[1:03:57] kind of rough you know and I was in the
[1:03:59] store just waiting and she looked at me
[1:04:02] and she said something terrible
[1:04:05] you know what not and I just told her I
[1:04:08] said ma'am I said God made me thus I
[1:04:12] didn't Flinch I didn't feel no kind of
[1:04:14] Airway brother and then she said it
[1:04:16] again I said ma'am God made me what I am
[1:04:21] I can't change that
[1:04:24] then also she said how you doing sir
[1:04:27] I say I'm doing fine how are you doing
[1:04:31] in a minute the column and little with
[1:04:34] her looking at me to get thought we're
[1:04:36] going to go off you know
[1:04:37] because she don't know me never saw me
[1:04:40] before I don't know her
[1:04:42] but the devil for that moment just
[1:04:43] annoyed her to say some derogatory stuff
[1:04:47] you know but God was so good I didn't
[1:04:50] even flinched it even moved
[1:04:53] you know and I forget what all we said
[1:04:55] but at the end of it you know she said
[1:04:57] sir and I said ma'am God bless you
[1:05:02] you know but but because then if I had
[1:05:04] the think about it
[1:05:08] a little while
[1:05:10] if I had to think what I'm gonna say if
[1:05:12] my women home
[1:05:14] The Man Behind the cabinet looking come
[1:05:16] on you know and leave it with her I've
[1:05:19] been looking kind of you know funny like
[1:05:21] oh goodness she gonna get knocked out
[1:05:25] you know when they look at her you know
[1:05:28] what not but you know thank God
[1:05:33] thank God for his grace and his Mercy he
[1:05:36] kept me
[1:05:38] and never had no bad feelings even
[1:05:40] father later because I realized that the
[1:05:42] devil don't know enough
[1:05:45] the devil will anoint people
[1:05:49] just to see how we're going to kind of
[1:05:51] react
[1:05:55] some people said
[1:05:57] don't try me because I just lay the
[1:05:59] whole it goes down for a little while
[1:06:03] and then I'll pick it back up when I get
[1:06:05] through
[1:06:08] you don't have it right yet then
[1:06:12] you don't have it right because there is
[1:06:14] coming a persecution there you will be
[1:06:18] tried
[1:06:21] I said Lord don't try me like you did
[1:06:24] David
[1:06:27] spit in his face
[1:06:29] saw a long Sun tried to kill him
[1:06:34] David still said don't touch him
[1:06:38] see don't touch the anointing don't do
[1:06:40] my protest no
[1:06:44] and I want to know you know this over
[1:06:46] here we are going to be tried
[1:06:52] on what we are confessing because it got
[1:06:54] to be more than just word confessed it
[1:06:57] got to be something you possess
[1:07:02] not just on Sunday
[1:07:05] on Friday
[1:07:08] you have to be seven days a week all day
[1:07:11] long in night
[1:07:14] can the love of God don't just leave
[1:07:19] if it's pure if it's real if it's not
[1:07:22] hypocritical it's there
[1:07:26] and you don't have to act it
[1:07:30] because it's something God gives you
[1:07:34] that's why the Holy Ghost is so
[1:07:37] important it's love
[1:07:40] it's a gift
[1:07:42] a gift of love
[1:07:45] that he hasn't stored upon you
[1:07:50] they keep you
[1:07:52] in the hour of your temptation
[1:07:56] how many of you believe that
[1:07:59] it'll keep you in the hour
[1:08:02] one more scripture Romans 12 and I'm
[1:08:04] closing there
[1:08:06] many more as I was thinking on these
[1:08:09] things and I got sat down and started
[1:08:12] writing I wound up I said God this is
[1:08:14] just I know this is too much you know so
[1:08:17] I'm not trying to
[1:08:19] um maybe I'll carry it back and do a
[1:08:20] part two or three back home they're
[1:08:23] marrying what not because I understand
[1:08:25] this
[1:08:28] don't you know all mistress
[1:08:31] and or you can give your body to be
[1:08:33] burned if you don't have any cherry
[1:08:36] you don't have the love because they
[1:08:38] talk about perfect love
[1:08:40] perfect love God is the only perfect
[1:08:44] person
[1:08:47] and God love is perfect
[1:08:51] and when you get him in you
[1:08:55] then it'll live out
[1:08:58] what he really is because he's loved
[1:09:02] and if you're giving out anything
[1:09:04] different it's the wrong spirit
[1:09:09] and it comes through the baptism of the
[1:09:11] Holy Ghost
[1:09:13] when you get love right
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:18] oh my
[1:09:20] I wish that people can do you know one
[1:09:23] place it was saying they're great one of
[1:09:24] the greatest commandment if you to love
[1:09:26] God with all your heart all your mind
[1:09:29] all your soul
[1:09:32] oh what a love
[1:09:34] if a church full of love I believe the
[1:09:38] gifts and the power of God will be it
[1:09:40] explode
[1:09:43] you talking about having Church
[1:09:47] When Love is just playing solving Grace
[1:09:50] will take over
[1:09:53] love because demon to be cast out
[1:09:57] love a cover a multitude of sin
[1:10:01] love or do it
[1:10:04] love and heal love and deliver love is
[1:10:07] set free
[1:10:13] that's just saying this on Let It Be
[1:10:15] Real let it be real
[1:10:17] whatever you do for Jesus
[1:10:21] oh that's what we need in this hour
[1:10:24] what do we want from that we want our
[1:10:26] love for God to be so real
[1:10:30] now where people will want what you got
[1:10:34] it's not what you're saying
[1:10:37] it's not what you're reading and what
[1:10:39] you got on your walls in your office and
[1:10:42] no no that's all right you want to do it
[1:10:44] but that still don't mean nothing
[1:10:48] because see the delicate impersonator
[1:10:51] the gifts he can impersonate it
[1:10:54] Paul said they assist
[1:10:57] but he said what love never
[1:11:03] okay Romans 12 and I'm coming brother
[1:11:05] Caleb
[1:11:06] I said Romans 12 9 and 10.
[1:11:10] it says let love be without this
[1:11:13] humiliation abhor that which is evil
[1:11:16] Cleaves that which is good be kindly
[1:11:20] affected one to another with Brotherly
[1:11:23] Love in honor
[1:11:26] preferring one another not slopefully
[1:11:29] business forever in spirit servant Lord
[1:11:31] rejoicing hope patient and tribulation
[1:11:34] continuing instant in prayer
[1:11:36] Distributing to necessity of saints
[1:11:39] given to hospital bless them which
[1:11:42] persecute you bless and curse not
[1:11:48] you know
[1:11:50] I'll be with something it says it's uh
[1:11:54] the little foxes
[1:11:57] this board of mine
[1:12:00] it's not the big thing it's the little
[1:12:02] foxes
[1:12:05] see the love of God
[1:12:09] you know
[1:12:10] it words said
[1:12:15] but it's something that has to be
[1:12:17] anchored in you
[1:12:22] and you when the love of God is really a
[1:12:24] dear you will learn to humble yourself
[1:12:29] and you will care more about others
[1:12:34] it won't be about me
[1:12:37] where I got what I got I got this I do
[1:12:40] this I do this no how about that one
[1:12:43] that's without
[1:12:46] women don't even know Jesus as a person
[1:12:48] who said yes they may be on drugs they
[1:12:51] may be bound let me be this way but your
[1:12:53] love for God letting her sister brother
[1:12:55] I know somebody that can help you
[1:12:58] and you can give me your testimony
[1:13:00] because he helped me
[1:13:02] when I was in this participant when I
[1:13:04] was in this shape God came by one day
[1:13:06] when I even had no hope in myself God
[1:13:09] reached down and picked me up
[1:13:12] how about that kind of love
[1:13:14] how about a church that can love like
[1:13:16] that and when people come in the door
[1:13:18] they just repent
[1:13:22] they run to those that I want to be
[1:13:25] saved
[1:13:26] because there's such a love of God we
[1:13:30] don't want to come to church with envy
[1:13:31] and strife and all type of contention we
[1:13:35] should have come to church like that
[1:13:37] which the government started free and
[1:13:39] loving and if you got a spirit on the
[1:13:42] gifts of wings and alter your seat see
[1:13:44] God deliver me
[1:13:47] take that Spirit off of me God is fill
[1:13:50] me with your love how many you want that
[1:13:54] that kind of love that it goes down way
[1:13:58] always down
[1:14:01] to even your children know that you love
[1:14:04] them
[1:14:05] not because of what you buy them
[1:14:09] but there's something in you that's real
[1:14:13] you care and you're praying
[1:14:17] because talking we how many know we
[1:14:19] don't talk talk talk haven't changed
[1:14:21] anything yet
[1:14:22] let's talk to Jesus now man
[1:14:25] Let's Get Down let them oh I know the
[1:14:28] old the old folks had that model
[1:14:31] I'm gonna tell you something they cried
[1:14:33] out all night long
[1:14:36] it got worser but they didn't stop
[1:14:38] praying
[1:14:40] Lord Marshal
[1:14:42] Lord dear soul I don't know where they
[1:14:45] at oh God but you know where they at
[1:14:48] Lord drive them home some kind of way
[1:14:52] silver God said when you pray like that
[1:14:54] he said something gold is happening
[1:14:58] oh Lord come on don't think your prayers
[1:15:00] something is moving
[1:15:02] and it's not acting worse that's the
[1:15:05] good sign yes God is moving
[1:15:09] why because the love of God can screen
[1:15:11] you
[1:15:12] God bless you tonight
[1:15:14] [Applause]
[1:15:27] praise God I thought about something
[1:15:30] where Jeremiah just saying
[1:15:32] and brother brother called and left a
[1:15:34] message on the answer machine and I
[1:15:36] called him
[1:15:37] he said y'all ain't forgot about me
[1:15:41] I've been going through
[1:15:42] some trouble times right now
[1:15:46] and I said
[1:15:48] I said oh my numbers got off my phone
[1:15:51] because every now and then I call him
[1:15:52] check on him
[1:15:54] and sometimes you think
[1:15:56] you look around and you say so-and-so
[1:15:58] and ain't here
[1:16:00] I think
[1:16:01] it'd be good to you know
[1:16:04] just call and check on somebody that you
[1:16:06] ain't seen in a while
[1:16:08] because you don't know what they're
[1:16:09] going through
[1:16:11] and when you say well you know they
[1:16:13] don't want to come
[1:16:15] don't let me be the only one chicken
[1:16:19] if you see somebody that's not here
[1:16:21] check on them see how they're doing
[1:16:25] and gotta you know reward you
[1:16:29] and sometimes I have to back up a little
[1:16:32] while
[1:16:33] somebody said well you ain't checked on
[1:16:35] me
[1:16:35] I lost all my numbers so I got a big
[1:16:39] excuse
[1:16:42] now if you to call me and check on me
[1:16:45] then you realize I lost all my numbers
[1:16:47] I'm trying to get them all back but by
