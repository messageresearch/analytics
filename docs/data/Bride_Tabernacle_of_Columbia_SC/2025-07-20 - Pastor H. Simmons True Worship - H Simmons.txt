We certainly welcome you bride tabernacle this morning. Those that are here and those that are listening in, let us just bow. you have a special need, you can lift your hands to the Lord and say, "Lord, I have a need." Father, in Jesus name, we thank you. For Lord, we are needy people, Lord. And we know that you're God. And we know that you know all things. And Lord God, you know what we have need of before we even ask. But you said, "Ask and it shall be given. Seek and you shall find." You said, "Knock and the door shall be open." So father as we look to the heels now from which cometh our help we ask you to look upon every need you said but my God should supply all of your needs according to his riches and glory. So, Father, I ask you, oh God, to look upon the Breed families today, Lord. God, look upon the Carol family today, Lord. Pray your strength be with the sister Carol and family. God, I pray God that you'll move here today. Oh God, that you touch hearts, touch lives, Lord. You heal, you save, you deliver. Oh God, you meet every need, Lord, for we trusting in your unfailing word of promise. In Jesus Christ's wonderful name we pray. Amen. As we stand for the reading of the scripture, the book of St. John 4 and 19. St. John 4:19. As we continue on the truth, Amen. And what is truth? The true church, the false church. Amen. Talk this morning about true worship. And it says here, the woman said unto him, sir, I perceive that thou prophet, our fathers worship in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Jesus said unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor at yet at Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye worship, ye know not what we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit and they that worship him and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth. The woman said unto him, I know that the Messiah cometh, which is called Christ, and and when he cometh, he will tell us all things. Jesus said unto her, I that speaketh unto thee am he. God bless and reach. You may be seated. Amen. Now we want to talk this morning concerning truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Worshiping God's true worship. Amen. Now Jesus told that woman that they should worship him in spirit and truth. He said I will cometh and thy ears. See because in time past they had a certain place to worship. They had Jerusalem and they had the temple and then and other they had a certain ceremonial type worship. They bought the the animal the bulls and the sacrifices to the temple and it was all told them by Moses how you offer the sacrifice for sin and a sacrifice for free will offering and a sacrifice for this. So they had a form of worship that God had ordained for that particular time. So the they said so they knew Amen. And then uh the Samaritan which was part Amen uh Jew but they uh had a place in where Jacob built the well. And um they said, "Well, the woman was at that well that her father built in that mountain." Amen. And they worshiped God in that mountain. But it came a time and a place that God said, "You don't have to come to this mountain, neither Jerusalem, but the hour cometh, and now is that the true worshippers going to worship God in spirit and truth." Amen. &gt;&gt; So it come a time where Amen. God was moving from ceremonial worship to God was going to move. Amen. That you're going to worship me in spirit now because all the time it was physical and outseen and they could see amen the animals. They could see the high priest. But now it comes time that God was calling for spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Okay. You know people are not uh ready to change. People don't want to change. If we if it was good enough for mama, good enough for grandmama, great grandmama, it good enough for us. And you know what? Even we have a certain men that we know God really used in a powerful way. We have Moses, we have Abraham, we have people that Amen. that God ordained and God used. Now look here. &gt;&gt; You said this is not good enough. You know, when it comes down to God question uh how we worship sometime we want to uh you know say God you knowh I've been worshiping this way all the time. How come you going to change it? Amen. See sometimes as I said on other occasion with this messages concerning truth. I said now people have their own truth. This is the way I believe it. Amen. They can tell God, you can take it or leave it cuz this is the way I believe. So it doesn't matter what the word says. Amen. Uh Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." Paul said, "What is truth?" &gt;&gt; Amen. So people have their own truth. Amen. And they have their own form of worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. People Amen. Some people Amen. Over in India they pray to the sun and sometimes their eyes become blind and the Hindu they have so many uh gods and maybe a million different gods and sometime they don't eat meat or anything like that if they really really Hindu because they believe in reincarnation that uh maybe that's if I kill a roach that might be one of my cousins uh you know and I can't eat certain things because uh Amen. We believe that you leave here, you come back maybe as a cow and and the cow is very sacred. So we can't eat no hamburger. Okay. So um people but that's what that's how they worship God. They and and and the Muslim they they they look towards, you know, uh praying three times a day and a a and they're faithful at it and you can't stop them because that's their form of worship. And I'm going tell you something. As I said in Sunday school this morning, sometime those people outdo you &gt;&gt; and their in their worship and Amen. Sometimes they they can stand and for hours and those people are faithful, you know, and people say we got truth and we're really genuine Christians. But yet in in reality, Amen. They give God the less of them all. But when we said worship God in spirit and in truth, what are you saying? Amen. Because Amen. They had a form and it was required that they should do it a certain way and it had been established by Moses who God gave it to him. But yet God was changing their worship. He was changing what amen they were used to and he was moving away from the uh the natural temple saying all these things was just shadows. Amen. This was shadows and it was a type of what was to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when Jesus Messiah come, that woman recognized that when the Messiah come, Amen. He'll tell us all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll tell us what we need to be doing and how to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, she recognized he see because Jesus asked the woman, he said, "Uh, you know, you at this?" He said, "Go on, go get your husband." The woman said, "I have none." And Jesus said, "You said,"Well, because you had five husbands, and the one you shacking up with is not your husband." And she said, "Huh?" And she said, "Sir, I perceive that you're a prophet. I I know that when the Messiah come, he'll tell us these things. And Jesus just flat out and told her, "He that speaketh with you am he." Are you with me? He let her know who he was. But the Pharisees when they saw him, they had their own ecclesiastical, Amen. custom type. They have been set in. And they were solid on what they believe and they were sticking to it. So when Jesus come they were knew that yes if the Messiah come he must be a Pharisee. Then you had to sell your seeds. Amen. Say if God if the Messiah come we all ready for him. We done taught the people how the Messiah would come. If he come he going to be a sused you see. And so the people were amen in the expectation for him to come. Whether you were fire seed or sused, they know the Messiah was to come. &gt;&gt; But when he come they they they united together and they all perceived that he was the prince of devils. See? Amen. The true worshippers going to worship God in spirit and in truth. Amen. And the only way you're going to know who the Messiah is, Amen, he has to reveal it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want a savior to save you from your sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want Amen. Uh the the the uh the Lord to help you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want the Lord Amen. to give you the kingdom of heaven and to eternal life. But you got to recognize who he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as long as we got our confidence in our church, in our preacher, Amen. And things like that, Amen. We may miss out on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because we already been taught how to think. Amen. What to look for when he come, how he would come. So we already got that. Oh, I know. when he come, he going to come. Amen. In a certain way. And you know, I I I I was praying this morning and I said, you know, so it's a shame. It's a shame before God and we offer God the our worship like we sometimes like we come and we offer God our worship and we want to know will your worship be accepted will what you giving God as a Christian and as a born again believer if will it be acceptable in God's sight are you with me true worship true is it True. Is it sincere? Are you honest? Are you really all in? Praise God. I seen, you know, in the natural, I seen uh when I played sports, I seen football players that were, you know, they were just playing. I mean, they they they just played around. But I saw my junior year guys were big 250. Oh, big guys. And they were bigger. Look like they ought to be stronger. Look like they were old men almost. And look like they would have had it all together. Are you with me? But those guys, they were kind of they were more into the girls and uh most of them got married almost before they got out of high school. I mean, as soon as they got out cuz they looked like they were old men, but the football team wasn't that good. The next year, you know, senior year, guys look, they weren't so big. got a few big guys, but looked like the people, they were excited and they were all in and I look like we went undefeated in the state of South Carolina and one tie game. But you saw the difference when people were uh uh together on one accord, they want to accomplish something. You know when we come together. Amen. The Bible said when two or three are gathered in my name, he said I'll be in the midst. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're talking about excited people. You know the excited people are the poor people. The poor people seem to get more out of worship than the people that God ble look like they got all the blessings, but they won't give God back. or you know they they won't they won't give God what he asks of them. They won't praise God cuz they got they got a nice house, they got a nice car, they make good money, but when it come down to worship, look like they because they got everything, they don't they they don't want to give God praise. &gt;&gt; They don't thank God enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they they they got it all. So they give him Amen. a form of worship. God don't want formality. God wants uh worship that comes from sincerity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he want worship from your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we can all I I can we can all get pumped up. Everybody ought to praise the Lord. You ought to get up. You all to get up on your seat and everybody can get to jumping and we can say let's give praise uh uh music for about a minute about two minutes in here and organ everybody can get to dancing it which is all right that people can be sincere but I want to know amen are we doing it just because we asked to do it are we doing it because this is the way the church do it or are we doing it because amen there's spontaneous praise. We know what God requires. &gt;&gt; We know God wants to be worship &gt;&gt; and I want to give him what he asked for. &gt;&gt; David says, "Amen. Praise God. If I had 10,000 tongues, it wouldn't be sufficient enough to praise God like I want to." &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want to worship. Amen. And it says, "Make a charge for noise unto the Lord. Serve the Lord with gladness." &gt;&gt; Amen. But the people, I can't, what am I glad about? I'm glad he saved me. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he saved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can worship God because I'm glad. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be saved. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to worship God. I want to show him how much I appreciate what he's done for me and what he's doing in my life. I want to say, "Thank you, Jesus. Lord, I love you and I appreciate because you're good." &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "He good and his mercy endureth forever. I love the Lord because you heard my cry." &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; True worship ought to be sincere worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People Amen. I believe they sing and I believe they they they they play music and all and what is the sincerity? He said spirit and are you sincere? Because once they get through singing, the chatting and the on the phone, huh? They tune God out. They're not all in. Where is the sincerity? When in your worship, you ought to be sincere. I come to worship God. And God eyes are on the sparrow. He watches over us. He sees everything we do. He sees even what we think. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So if I'm a worship God, God knows whether or not I'm all in or whether or not I'm just faking it. &gt;&gt; But when I'm all in, I'm mean. I'm here, but I'm here to please God. I'm here to worship God. &gt;&gt; I want what I do to please him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ain't all the time got to jump up and shout and dance, but you got to you got to be sincere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to be sincere and you need to feel like when I wave my hand and Lord, I'm waving it in Jesus' name. And Lord, I want my worship. Somebody said my worship is for real. I don't know about them, but you know what I'm saying. I want mine to be real. &gt;&gt; How about you? When when I praise God, I want I I'm doing it because I love you. &gt;&gt; I I Nobody got to make me do it. I want to do it. &gt;&gt; I want to tell God thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. I don't mind telling him thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody they sung the other night. And I don't want no rocks uh you know to cry out. I don't want the rocks to praise him for me. &gt;&gt; I don't want no bird. &gt;&gt; Amen. That what they said. They didn't want no bird. I don't want no bird to take my place. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't want the trees to take my place. &gt;&gt; I want to I I want to do what I supposed to do. I I want God to say yes. Yes, I'm pleased with it. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, Lord, amen. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We talk about worshiping and in spirit in truth. We talking about true worship. Amen. Praise God. When you got when when you when you mean what you're doing, &gt;&gt; you know, not not just doing it cuz Oh, I believe I sing a song today. Keep it. &gt;&gt; We don't need it. This ain't no showing, no performing. We ain't coming to no beauty contest. &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to worship God. &gt;&gt; If you don't want to give God praise, don't I ain't going to make you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you It's all right to praise God if you want to. &gt;&gt; If you think he's worthy of it, if if you think God deserve it and you think God is worth it, it's all right to give it to him. But if you think God, you know, Yeah. Yeah. Somebody said, "Well, I don't know." You got people out praising you, out dancing in the spirit, and they ain't living like the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Well, thank God." Hallelujah. Worship God in what? &gt;&gt; Spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. In spirit and truth. Amen. That it ought to be a life behind your worship. It ought to be a revelation. I believe we're missing the revelation of worship. &gt;&gt; I believe the reason why we worship like we worship because we're missing it. You know, I was just in a big convention down in Louisiana. It was, you know, looked like a 1500,000 over well over a thousand people there. And I I seen those people. They stood on their feet. They was jumping and everything was all hoof. They had that thing together. Amen. And see, we got the new kind of worship. We got the lights and everything going and you know, look like a nightclub and everybody got to jump. Are you with me? Y'all seen that new kind of worship? The church look like a nightclub and everybody got the music going and everybody know what they supposed to do. See, I I I refuse it. I refuse to amen put on a great a a big show and a and everybody come to know what they got to do. You got to Amen. worship God in spirit and truth. You're sincere from your heart. You giving God. I said, "Lord, do I think about it?" Sometime we ain't thinking you know really you know sometimes in your prayer life you don't approach God right because you just going through the motion and you just praying saying things but when you really down to bit I'm tell you something you have a real genuine need a life and death situation or a very crucial need in your life you ain't going to be s I'm Lord I thank you for no you you going to get down there and tell him what you really need. &gt;&gt; Amen. You going you going to get desperate. Lord, I I you going to get sincere. &gt;&gt; Amen. The doctor come to telling you you got an incurable disease and you going you got got a a five maybe five months to live and you get down there and you pray different cuz the doctor done told you you ain't got much time. But as long as you think you all right, your prayer might say, "Lord, I thank you for another day. Lord, watch over me today. Thank you, Jesus. Bye." I believe we got to be more sincere. We got to wait sometimes on the anointing. Wait on the presence to come. God, what would you have me to say? But what would you have me to know? I don't want to go through the motion in prayer, but I want to I want to pray right because I know God, you can tell me something. I need you can lead me. You can guide me. I want to know that you're speaking to my heart. Lord, I want to know, Amen. Amen. That God is in this this day. You know I if you in a crossroad right now in your life in that crossroad in your life and you asking God for direction and guidance you got to move out the way. Don't ask God for what you want, but God, you know what I need. Because once you've already put in your mind that I'm in a crossroad and asking God for direction, but I already put in my mind what I what I want. And it and if it don't come that way, I believe God don't ain't didn't hear me. He's not listening to me. I I know I because I asked him, Amen. to direct me and to guide me. Yet, I had my I I already in my spirit. I already had in my mind what I wanted. You see what I'm saying? See, God bypass you. He's telling you, I want you out of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want me to do it, then you get out the way and let me do what I want to do. Let me lead you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Let me direct your path. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I'm God and you ask me to do it, then get out the way. &gt;&gt; Speaking to somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is a good God. True worshippers. See, we want power more than form. See, sometimes we want a form of godliness. Spirit and in truth. Worship God in spirit and in truth. We want form more than power. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You ought to want the power of God. Not a form of godliness, but I want God's power. God, I want you to come down as you consume the offering for Elijah. And you were able to confirm that you were God. I want you to confirm my worship. Oh Lord, by sending your anointing, your in vindication, God, I need you to come down. And Lord, if my worship is accepted by you, then come, Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me know that &gt;&gt; that you're pleased with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe what we do for the Lord and how we worship God, how is our attitude, right? Do we think we doing God a service? Do we think are we doing it because you're saying thank you, Lord? Are are we thinking that, "Oh, Lord, look, I'm doing this for you. Our worship ought to be something that we giving back what he's given to us. Are you with me? Lord, what you gave to me, I want to give it back. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So God gives us life. God gives us breath. See, he said everything with breath ought to what? &gt;&gt; Because our breath don't come just because, Amen. we decided to wake up this morning. It comes from the Lord. So everything with breath ought to &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But people got breath, but they're not what? &gt;&gt; And and that's what I'm saying. Don't think, you know, I had so many gifted people. And I've seen so many people that were so gifted and so mightily used by God, but they they began to think that what I'm doing, I'm being used. Sometimes some of the beautiful voices and some of the most gifted musicians will think that if you're not paying me $500 to $1,000 that I'm being used. If we say, "Thank you, brother, sister. I really appreciate you." That's not enough. Amen. Because down the street they giving $500 a Sunday and over there they giving $1,000. I I'm trying to see. Amen. What I can get. See, but you got to be able to worship God. Amen. Not because in what you do, don't you think that you're doing God a favor? Amen. When you praise God, don't you think you're doing God a favor. It ought to be, Amen. Lord, I thank you because I appreciate you. I thank you because I love you. I thank you because I want to praise you. Amen. I worship the Lord. Amen. I want to give him everything I got. &gt;&gt; I ain't got enough. I I And I haven't done enough for the Lord. &gt;&gt; I to show how much I appreciate him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I I don't understand how people get tired. Amen. O of doing for the Lord and doing things for the Lord. I don't understand, especially young people. I don't understand. I'm so tired. I I didn't get died, man. We We barely got a few hours sleep out there witnessing, going from city to city, knocking on doors, preaching in the street sometimes. Amen. Talking to the down and out and those that didn't have it. Amen. Those that were Amen. It was something about that. Your worship, true worship. Amen. You got to be, you want to witness for the Lord. It's something when you receive the Holy Ghost. After the Holy Ghost, you will have power and you shall be witnesses of me. You got a testimony. You want to tell somebody about Jesus. That's all a form of you worshiping God. Not just coming to church clapping your hand, not just singing a song. Amen. But your whole life becomes a life of continual worship. Everything I do, everything. Hallelujah. I wanted to be pleasing and acceptable in God's sight. Amen. I'm worshiping God when I'm walking and when I'm working. Amen. When I'm exercising, I'm worshiping God. Lord, I'm saying thank you. Praise God. Some of the best time to worship God when you're walking. Get some exercise. Thanking the Lord. Hallelujah. I can sing then and nobody laugh at me cuz I'm just singing to the Lord out there by myself. You see what I'm saying? your worship and the presence of God comes and I feel his goodness. Sometimes I just speak in tongues a little while and I just thank the Lord for just showering out his mercy and his glory upon them. Y'all ought to try. God will meet you anywhere at any time if you start looking at what God has done for you and what he's doing in your life. God will meet you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Worship God in spirit and in truth. I hope I said enough. I want you to worship God, right? Remember, we don't turn God on, turn him off. We don't say, "Hey, this is the way you got to do it. This is the way you I want you to do it. Everybody trying to do the same thing. God might tell you to do a little something different. I think my children say, "Daddy, everybody shout the same way, dance the same way." I think uh maybe maybe that was over to the house and some of the older people were talking about sisters and all. They said, "No, they used to people used to dance in different ways. Everybody didn't shout a lack or get in the spirit the same way. Some people jump up and down. Some people had a certain dance and other person had a certain dance. The Holy Ghost is just moving. People get to dancing and shouting and the Holy Ghost is just move all over the church and the people. Amen. But now everybody doing get your part and let's come on. Sometime it's all right. I ain't going to say that. But lots of time we just we just working up something. We just trying to do something that we work up and because we got all sweaty and because we got Amen. got a good exercise, workout, we think that God, it's it's pleasing. It's acceptable to God. And I want to tell you, not all the time. See, because Cain knew that what he was doing, it should have been accepted. And Abel, what he was doing, it didn't look good. It wasn't pretty. But he offered up, Amen, a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain. Amen. He took a bloody lamb and he slaved and he offered up blood. But Cain offered up the fruits of the field and he got all the little pretty flowers and everything look good. But God, it wasn't acceptable. And sometimes that's the way some you know you you know God you ought to be glad that I I I could I sing a song. No. No. Let's not get the wrong kind of attitude. Be humble. Be meek. Be kind. And worship God in spirit and truth. And know that the true worshippers know that they they're not even worthy of God's grace and God love and kindness. I I don't even deserve it. I I'm not even worthy of it. Jesus, you died on that cross and you took my sins and you bear them in your own body. You bled. You were spit on. You had the power to call 12 legion of angels. But you didn't. You hung there for me. You died for me. You died for my sins. When I should have went to hell, you went there for me. He took my place on an old rugged cross. Didn't have to do it, but he did. And I'm glad he did. &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, when you think about your worship, is it true worship? Is it from your heart? Does God deserve your worship? Do you want to give God back what he's given to you? He gave his life. He gave his life for you that you can turn around and all you all he asks of you to thank him. Thank him for what he's done. But in turn, what do we do? When we do worship, we think we're doing God a favor. I want you to be all in. David realized his birth was born in sin shaped in iniquity. And we realized that that God called him to be king when he was just a little boy minding the sheep. I wasn't worthy of God's mercy and grace, but he came and got me. I don't know where you were when he came and spoke to your heart. when he came to get you. What? I don't know where you were, what you were doing. When Jesus stopped by, let you know he was savior. He was Lord. Let you know how much he loved you and how much he cared about you. Don't never forget the love of God and what he's done for you. Don't never get caught up. looking at others and looking at things. Keep your eyes on Jesus. Let your worship be true, honesty, sincere that it would please God. I'm not worried about pleasing the preacher, the church, or men. I want to please God. I want it to come from my heart. This is what I want to give back cuz I know Jesus is good to me. Sometime you just whistle a prayer not knowing God. Thank you. Let us bow our heads. Thank you. Let us bow our heads. Sometimes we forget. Sometimes we are not mindful. Sometimes we go through the motion. I know I'm guilty sometimes. [Music] But we got to focus. Focus on the true and living God. [Music] The God that does all things well. Care more about us than we care about ourselves. Loved us unconditionally. Thank you for having mercy on me. Thank you for caring when I didn't know where I should turn and what to do with my life. God didn't know where I was going and where I would end up. Lord, just a young boy trying to find myself. [Music] Why? Where am I going? and what am I going to do in my life? You came by. You saw me there. Lord, you saw that I needed a savior. You thought that I needed somebody give me purpose to give me purpose. Lord, I needed purpose for living. I needed someone something that I can believe in. I can trust Lord maybe Lord somebody he hears come to the turning point come to the cross road they need give their hearts to you Lord of you if God has spoke to your heart this morning. Give him opportunity to come in and s with you. Lord, I know you died for me. I need you now. How many would we just lift your hands? Lord, I need you right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. right now. Lord, I want to welcome your presence. Lord, I want to get into sincerity. I want your minds to get on the Lord Jesus. Ask him to meet your need now. Ask him to do something, Lord, with my life, God, because I can't lead myself. God, here I am. God, guide me, Lord. Lead me, oh great Jehovah. I need your help this morning. I need deliverance, Lord.

May your blood cover us. May you keep us in your name. And father, thank you for the food that's been prepared, the hands that prepared it. May, oh God, that you bless it, sanctify it in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And Lord, may you get all the glory, all the praise, and thank you for your children, Lord, everyone that press their way this day. Lord, may your blessings be upon everyone. May the Lord watch between me and thee. While we absent one from another, let us all say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. [Music]
