[27:03] you want to turn to the book of
[27:06] ephesians
[27:11] ephesian the fifth chapter
[27:16] and it's kind of a continuation of
[27:19] something that i
[27:20] had spoke a little while ago
[27:26] in season five
[27:30] and i entitled it redeeming your time
[27:35] redeeming your time
[27:37] [Music]
[27:41] the book of ephesians 5 13-20
[27:48] but all things that are reproved are
[27:50] made manifested
[27:52] by the light for whatsoever do to make
[27:56] manifest is light wherefore he sayeth
[27:59] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[28:02] the dead
[28:04] and christ should give thee light
[28:07] seeing then that you walk circumspectly
[28:10] not as fools but as wise
[28:13] redeeming the time because the days are
[28:17] evil wherefore be ye not unwise but
[28:21] understanding
[28:22] what the will of the lord is and be not
[28:25] drunk with wine
[28:27] wherein excess but be filled
[28:30] with the spirit speaking to yourselves
[28:33] in
[28:33] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[28:37] singing making melody in your heart
[28:40] to the lord giving thanks always
[28:44] for all things unto god and the father
[28:47] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[28:50] let us pray father god we want to thank
[28:53] you tonight lord for
[28:55] your mercy and for your grace lord
[28:58] pray god that you will bless the reading
[29:00] of the word lord and
[29:02] let the spirit of god lord give us
[29:04] understanding lord
[29:06] help us oh god to understand the hour
[29:09] and the day that
[29:10] we are now living in father we realize
[29:13] god that darkness is covering the earth
[29:16] lord
[29:17] gross darkness like never before
[29:20] lord everything has been shaking lord in
[29:23] the country the world every nation god
[29:26] has been
[29:27] shook up god by what's going on oh god
[29:30] but you said
[29:32] lord there will be light in the evening
[29:35] time lord and
[29:36] we are so grateful for the mercy and
[29:38] grace that
[29:40] you have allowed us of god to be
[29:42] partakers of
[29:43] what you are doing in this hour a lot of
[29:46] our hearts are made glad
[29:48] oh god but yet lord is a sad time for
[29:52] those that don't know where they're at
[29:54] lord is walking around in darkness and
[29:57] missing the light
[29:58] oh god that you sent forth oh god but
[30:01] help us tonight lord
[30:03] to walk in it lord and live in it for we
[30:06] ask these things in jesus
[30:08] name amen and amen may be seated
[30:15] like you said we it's a continuation of
[30:19] something that i'd
[30:20] uh believe a good while back i started
[30:23] it
[30:24] and kind of dropped off of it but
[30:27] uh wanted to try to come back and
[30:31] maybe rehearse or reiterate and by god's
[30:35] grace
[30:35] hopefully that we can just try to
[30:39] uh encourage you and and get you to
[30:42] understand
[30:44] uh where we're at uh
[30:47] uh the bible said that here that uh
[30:51] seeing then that we walk
[30:55] circumspectly not as fools but as
[30:58] wise in other words
[31:02] what it's saying here that we we
[31:05] uh are careful how we are living
[31:09] our lives in a dark world that we are
[31:13] living that's full of corruption
[31:16] and that so much is going on all around
[31:19] us that
[31:20] everywhere you turn there's just uh
[31:22] gross darkness
[31:24] everything just seems to be corrupt
[31:29] and he's saying here that but we are
[31:32] not like food but we are wise
[31:35] we understanding the hour and
[31:39] and the day that we are living in and
[31:41] we'll realize that
[31:43] no matter what the political world may
[31:46] uh try to give good speeches about the
[31:49] country and
[31:50] bringing things back it'll never come
[31:53] back
[31:54] will you realize it'll get worse and
[31:57] it'll get worse but with god in this
[32:01] hour has
[32:02] has shined a light and that light that
[32:06] he
[32:06] shines it causes us to walk
[32:10] and to live circumspectly we don't want
[32:14] to get
[32:15] entangled with the yokes and the things
[32:18] of the world but
[32:19] we realize that we're at the end of all
[32:22] things
[32:23] regardless of what they might do
[32:25] regardless of who
[32:27] is president we realize that nobody can
[32:30] bring it back
[32:32] it's been prophesied that you know it's
[32:34] doomed
[32:36] yet they're trying to rebuild something
[32:39] on a foundation that
[32:41] has been destroyed but we
[32:44] you know is give us great honor and not
[32:48] to be
[32:48] proud but to be uh so grateful
[32:52] that god had chosen you and i
[32:57] to reveal the things that he has
[33:00] done in this hour not only what he's
[33:03] done but
[33:04] to let us know how to escape
[33:07] it how to live our lives and
[33:11] how to govern ourselves that we won't
[33:14] get
[33:14] caught in the trap of what the world is
[33:18] trying to mold in
[33:22] redeeming your time and i i really
[33:25] believe
[33:25] that uh just like without this
[33:28] remembering
[33:29] every uh incident special that happened
[33:32] to the country
[33:34] that impacted the country um
[33:37] it's jelly is a a repeat
[33:41] you know after it has happened and after
[33:44] it's settled down
[33:45] seemingly the people go right back and
[33:48] continue to do the things that they
[33:50] always did
[33:52] not taking any notice that uh
[33:56] they are living on sinking sand
[34:00] and that it could be over in a few hours
[34:04] your life my life and their life but
[34:08] they take no really uh a thought
[34:11] or you know that you know where am i at
[34:15] what do i need to be doing because you
[34:18] got a soul that
[34:20] you're going to have to give an account
[34:21] for
[34:23] you're going to have to give an account
[34:25] for the life that
[34:27] you lived
[34:30] i was telling some people the other day
[34:34] you know we uh sometimes
[34:37] because of uh you know the message of
[34:40] the hour that god
[34:42] sent us and uh and to some
[34:45] people you know it is it's just a
[34:48] message that brother branham brought
[34:50] but uh and all the things that
[34:53] he has spoken to us and and prophesied
[34:57] he went right back to the scripture
[35:00] to show us where we are at
[35:04] and that i listened to him you know he
[35:06] was so
[35:07] impacted that it could have been over
[35:10] back then
[35:11] and he felt intensity as he
[35:14] traveled and look at the condition of
[35:17] the country that
[35:18] where are we at brothers it's over
[35:22] and he just felt that empire i said lord
[35:25] if he
[35:25] felt that way back then you know
[35:29] how much more are we have to feel the
[35:32] impact
[35:33] of what's going on now we've heard and
[35:36] we have seen
[35:38] uh the things that god has spoken to us
[35:42] in this
[35:42] hour and sometimes they see them like
[35:45] it don't do nothing
[35:48] just words that's been uttered and
[35:51] things that has been
[35:52] said and we get a little you know move
[35:55] by
[35:56] for a day but after a while
[35:59] we go right back into the same nominal
[36:03] church routine you know our
[36:07] hearts and our spirits you know are not
[36:10] stirred and
[36:11] we are not crying out and and seeking
[36:14] god
[36:15] lord i need more
[36:18] we can't just sit around and be like
[36:21] everybody else
[36:23] we ought to know if the holy and i know
[36:26] it takes
[36:26] god to do it it takes the holy ghost to
[36:29] really
[36:30] uh do something in our lives that
[36:34] we can feel that the spirit of god
[36:37] is saying it's over prepare yourself
[36:42] or else are you going to be caught in it
[36:45] but the world the church world
[36:48] you know it seemed to be uh
[36:52] you know going and doing the things that
[36:55] they
[36:56] always did and people seem to be still
[37:00] uh good religious people and that
[37:03] loves to go to church and and talk about
[37:06] it and sing about god
[37:08] but there seems to be no reality
[37:12] there seems to be no impact that
[37:15] we are thirsty and we are hungry
[37:19] for oh lord don't let me get cold
[37:23] give me another stirring don't let my
[37:27] life be
[37:28] just a social life but lord i want to be
[37:31] stirred i want to be filled with all
[37:35] your lord
[37:37] do something in my life and that is
[37:40] something that i realize
[37:42] each individual is going to have to come
[37:46] to
[37:48] each individual god has to place
[37:51] that kind of thirst in your heart that
[37:55] when you were looking at uh your life
[37:57] and you looking at
[37:59] the condition around you and at home at
[38:03] work
[38:03] wherever you go all you see is chaos
[38:07] corruption people are probably saying
[38:10] people's hearts are failing for fear for
[38:13] the thing that is covered upon the earth
[38:16] and they don't know what to do
[38:18] they're looking for answers they're
[38:20] looking for uh what we got to prepare
[38:23] or are we ready for it now we we
[38:25] prepared for the next one
[38:27] but you don't know what it is
[38:30] no my so how can you really prepare for
[38:33] something
[38:34] and you don't know what you're preparing
[38:36] for but god in this hour
[38:39] it has made known to us what's going to
[38:43] happen
[38:44] he have spoken it and showing
[38:47] scripturally that
[38:48] uh the whole world is going to go into a
[38:51] state
[38:52] of insanity and here we are
[38:57] living in a world full of insanity
[39:01] people have done lost their minds and
[39:04] then
[39:05] lost control of what they ought to be
[39:08] doing
[39:09] and it got into the place that they
[39:11] don't know what to do
[39:15] right become wrong and wrong becomes
[39:17] right
[39:19] whatever a person decided to do did is
[39:22] do it
[39:24] not even thinking about the consequences
[39:27] but i pray tonight that we are who are
[39:30] the light we begin to examine where we
[39:34] act
[39:35] and to understand that we're at the
[39:38] end of it don't get comfortable don't
[39:41] get caught
[39:42] with the worlds and worry about this and
[39:44] that but
[39:45] set your mind on the things above
[39:50] oh my thinking about that song israel is
[39:53] shaking
[39:54] you know and how people are just going
[39:57] about like every other day
[40:00] you know and i know to realize that
[40:02] we've got to be
[40:03] uh mindful of what we are dealing with
[40:06] and what's going on around us but more
[40:10] so you know you want to find out lord
[40:13] uh whatever you're doing in this season
[40:15] lord
[40:16] don't let me miss it see because be the
[40:20] trouble of god said
[40:21] you know in the darkest hours that's
[40:24] when the supernatural takes place
[40:28] when things seem to seem so chaotic and
[40:31] and out of proportion god
[40:35] begins to move supernaturally
[40:38] and because the people have been
[40:40] distracted and
[40:41] moved from their spiritual walk
[40:45] they'll miss it but i pray tonight that
[40:49] you won't miss it because you know
[40:52] what you are looking for by by the word
[40:55] you know
[40:55] that what god promised you god is going
[40:59] to fulfill it
[41:02] oh my god something here
[41:07] it says here redeeming the 16 were
[41:10] redeeming the time
[41:12] because the days are evil there has
[41:16] never been a time that uh we are living
[41:19] in a day that i mean beyond corruption
[41:23] we have
[41:24] passed sodom
[41:27] we have passed the days of noah
[41:31] we have gotten to the place that if i be
[41:35] the servant god said that if god
[41:37] if it uh uh would cause solomon to raise
[41:41] up
[41:41] and let us get by with he have to repent
[41:45] because the people imagination and their
[41:47] mind
[41:48] had gotten so far beyond
[41:51] what's called natural we have lost the
[41:55] sense of
[41:56] what's decent and what's godly and
[42:00] what's
[42:00] ungodly i i was telling somebody you
[42:04] know that
[42:05] i was in my i was dreaming and
[42:08] and i was preaching a funeral and i was
[42:11] preaching you know that holiness is
[42:14] right
[42:15] regardless of whatever's going on
[42:18] holiness is right and i was just
[42:19] preaching and
[42:20] preaching the holiness is right you know
[42:24] and then you look at
[42:25] people that can't even discern what's
[42:28] holy
[42:29] and what's unholy because man
[42:32] had done made themselves a fake leaving
[42:36] religion
[42:38] and they have made uh uh a bylaws that
[42:42] as long as you doing this and that you
[42:45] are
[42:45] right and then they pacify the people
[42:49] that
[42:49] are all everybody's sin
[42:54] and come short yeah but you don't
[42:57] practice it
[42:59] you don't just use it as a cloak
[43:03] you do all that's within you to do to
[43:06] stay away from unrighteousness
[43:09] and if you fall short you got an
[43:11] advocator
[43:13] somebody to plead your case but just to
[43:16] go out and just sin
[43:18] and come back and say i got forgiveness
[43:21] oh sister brother please don't practice
[43:23] that
[43:24] but that's what the church world has
[43:27] done
[43:28] they've given the people this type of
[43:31] social standard that god
[43:34] understands
[43:37] let me tell you i don't know what what
[43:39] they think god really is about but god
[43:41] is holy
[43:44] god is not going to accept nothing else
[43:47] but
[43:47] holiness and i ain't have a in
[43:50] this
[43:51] church you know i'm talking holiness
[43:53] living
[43:55] where our life is measuring up
[43:58] to the standard that god placed
[44:01] in the word that's god's standard
[44:05] regardless of what anybody else said
[44:08] it's the word that is the standard
[44:11] but the people have left the standard
[44:15] and they made themselves a standard
[44:18] that god ain't even in it
[44:21] they're presented to the people and then
[44:24] the people become religious
[44:26] folks with a standard that have been
[44:29] artists created by
[44:31] some organization system
[44:35] and then god began to call and say come
[44:37] out of it
[44:39] come out of her my people don't be
[44:42] partakers of it
[44:44] see there's a call in this hour there's
[44:47] a call for
[44:48] us to be separate there's a call
[44:53] to be holy but the only way you can do
[44:57] it
[44:57] is get the holy ghost in you
[45:00] the only life that can present you
[45:03] folks before god is the holy ghost
[45:07] not churchy not religious act but the
[45:10] very
[45:11] life of god living in you
[45:15] the hope of glory
[45:21] what house will you build him
[45:26] what church will you build him
[45:30] god is not in a building made by hand
[45:33] but
[45:33] your body is the temple of the holy
[45:38] ghost
[45:39] that's why you can't do anything with
[45:41] your body
[45:42] you can't just lay around and gobble up
[45:45] this thing with your body because
[45:46] that's god dwelling place
[45:50] you are the living temple of god
[45:53] you are the living voice of god in this
[45:55] hour
[45:56] and god wants to present you holy
[46:00] oh my i just have to read it y'all
[46:03] forgive me
[46:05] romans 12
[46:08] it's my pet scripture
[46:12] 12-1
[46:18] look like this has been on my mind so
[46:20] much and
[46:21] look like evie i have to just read it
[46:24] because i'm just wringing out something
[46:26] that i believe that what god
[46:28] is calling us for to his perfection
[46:33] he said be ye perfect
[46:37] you say brother how can i do it you
[46:39] can't do within yourself
[46:41] but the holy ghost does it
[46:44] god living in you presents you
[46:47] perfect i know we see our faults and we
[46:51] see all the deals and that
[46:52] but god said what you talking about i
[46:54] don't even see
[46:56] what you thought you've been washed in
[46:58] the blood i've took away
[47:01] i've erased you have no
[47:04] sin i took your place
[47:08] now you can take my place i became
[47:12] sin for you that you can become the
[47:14] righteousness of god
[47:17] so when you are living a life deposit a
[47:20] life that i
[47:21] now live
[47:25] i'll live it by the son of god amen
[47:28] oh that life it it's
[47:31] urgent and i but this time expounding
[47:35] to the people that you know in all your
[47:38] getting
[47:39] get the life giver
[47:42] don't worry about the knowledge don't
[47:45] worry about
[47:46] gifts don't worry about you know how
[47:49] good you can preach or
[47:50] saying or play music but get the giver
[47:55] get the very source of life
[47:59] that's what he's looking for he's coming
[48:01] back for his
[48:02] own reflection he wants to see himself
[48:06] in you he doesn't want to see you
[48:10] but he wants to see christ the hope of
[48:13] glory
[48:14] tabernacle in an earthly vessel
[48:17] in colombia
[48:23] paul say here you see i beseech you
[48:27] you know what i'm pleading
[48:30] therefore brethren by the mercy of god
[48:34] that ye present your bodies
[48:38] a living sacrifice holy
[48:42] acceptable unto god which
[48:46] is your reasonable service
[48:50] see it's your reasonable
[48:54] service paul said another place he said
[48:57] examine yourself
[49:01] each one of us got to take inventory
[49:04] when
[49:05] when you international when you look in
[49:07] your mirror
[49:08] at your house before you leave home you
[49:11] see yourself
[49:12] standing there and you looking to see
[49:14] whether things are
[49:15] decently in order so when you look into
[49:18] the mirror of the word you want to say
[49:20] lord
[49:21] where am i at
[49:24] i need a checkup lord i need
[49:28] a more from you because i realize that
[49:32] it's going to take more in this hour
[49:36] you know i also was saying you know that
[49:39] when god
[49:40] gave us god made known to us the mystery
[49:43] of god and
[49:45] brought us back into fellowship with god
[49:47] and
[49:48] you know we're rejoiced by what god has
[49:51] given us and
[49:52] it's so much god had pulled out on us
[49:55] sometime to where
[49:56] sometimes i think we don't know what to
[49:58] do with it
[50:00] you know when you have a lot of
[50:01] something you just waste it
[50:04] you know like you give children so much
[50:06] to eat or whatever
[50:07] you know what day let's pick one little
[50:09] french fry
[50:11] and leave the whole everything else on
[50:14] the plate
[50:15] because if you give them small portions
[50:19] then they can eat it and
[50:22] i think sometimes you know i know for
[50:24] sure the bible
[50:26] said when much is given much
[50:29] is required we have been giving much
[50:34] we have been given the complete
[50:37] revelation
[50:38] of jesus christ in this hour
[50:42] no other age has had this
[50:45] that we of god they have their potion
[50:48] but here in the winding up we have
[50:52] part of theirs plus what god has given
[50:55] to
[50:55] us and so the truth that we have
[51:00] yes we have truth but you got to
[51:02] remember now it's going to be more
[51:04] required of you
[51:06] you're not going to get by with just
[51:09] sanctification
[51:10] of being justified you're going to have
[51:14] to have
[51:15] a more than that so
[51:18] it's good that we have the message but
[51:22] we are going to be hell accountable what
[51:25] are we doing with it
[51:28] just reading you know about the things
[51:32] of god and sometimes you know
[51:35] i understand i had an incident the other
[51:37] day that
[51:38] a young man who i'm working with
[51:43] a foreigner it's another elderly man
[51:46] that a christian man you know
[51:49] something years old you know and i don't
[51:52] say much to people so much about
[51:54] religion because it's such a touchy
[51:56] area i generally try to wait for an
[51:59] open door that where they'll open up a
[52:02] conversation and then
[52:04] i can you know so if they get a little
[52:06] easy about it i said well you don't want
[52:08] to ask the question
[52:10] are you the one that brought it out but
[52:12] this man here a really kind of a nice
[52:15] man he lived right near where brother
[52:16] gerald lived at um
[52:18] and he uh was talking the other day
[52:22] about you know the end time
[52:25] and the boss man who we work for he was
[52:28] there and he's a
[52:29] a baptist preacher and
[52:32] they were sitting there and they was
[52:34] talking you know about the election
[52:36] and how uh the ends of the time coming
[52:39] and things and so
[52:40] i don't know i just felt at that time
[52:43] it's your opportunity so i took
[52:46] advantage of the open door
[52:49] and and you know sometimes you don't
[52:52] know
[52:53] who have heard the things that we
[52:56] thought that nobody had to hear but this
[52:58] man began to expound and i'm saying sir
[53:01] i said uh bruce i said look
[53:05] i said y'all all know about uh the
[53:08] earthquakes and uh
[53:10] uh the pestilence i said but there is a
[53:13] scriptural voice that
[53:15] that god has sent forth in this hour to
[53:19] to uh restore the people faith back to
[53:22] god
[53:23] again and and then this i said god has
[53:26] sent a message in this
[53:27] hour and the older young man he said
[53:30] yeah he said i
[53:31] i've heard about it i said you did i
[53:33] said where
[53:34] and he said um there's a a man
[53:37] in walterborough nameless wrath
[53:40] something they supposed to with some
[53:41] kind of prophet he called himself
[53:43] and he got some compound there in
[53:45] walterboro
[53:46] that people were living on uh on the on
[53:49] from property
[53:51] and he said that this guy was saying
[53:53] that um
[53:54] you know how he's the last they
[53:56] messenger and i said wait a minute i
[53:58] said
[53:58] i said you ever heard of william branham
[54:00] then he said yes he said ralph talks
[54:02] about him
[54:03] he said yeah he said he was the sixth
[54:05] angel and ralph's saying that he was the
[54:07] seventh angel
[54:09] and i said really i said my brother i
[54:11] said now god
[54:12] don't have two messages in the same
[54:15] generation i said there's
[54:16] one message that god set and make that
[54:19] known i say mr
[54:20] wrath is only gleaning from what brother
[54:23] branham
[54:24] had taught us he said really he said
[54:27] well but
[54:28] i just was amazed that you never know
[54:30] what people have heard
[54:32] you know so it behooves us that as you
[54:35] said
[54:36] redeeming the time and it's actually
[54:39] speaking about
[54:40] taking advantage of the opportunity when
[54:43] it's
[54:44] given to you because though he heard
[54:47] what he heard and
[54:48] he got it all messed up you know what
[54:51] ralph i don't even i never
[54:52] i heard of them but i never heard of
[54:54] them and he got it all
[54:56] twisted up and messed up so there was
[54:59] opportunity for me to take advantage and
[55:02] just to try to show in the preaching he
[55:05] was sitting there with his mouth
[55:06] open like because he never heard none of
[55:10] it
[55:11] and he been looking you know like you
[55:13] know almost what are y'all talking about
[55:15] and i said bruce
[55:16] i said look i said if you want to talk
[55:19] let's talk
[55:20] i said but you need to know where you at
[55:24] we we need to know we can't just be
[55:26] preaching preaching
[55:28] and nothing is is transforming our
[55:30] people alive i say because
[55:32] god is gonna hold specials preachers
[55:35] accountable
[55:36] for what we're preaching to the people
[55:39] so we ought to even when god gives you
[55:42] an
[55:42] opportunity you ought to be a witness
[55:48] i believe is there ever a time now that
[55:50] we need to be a witness
[55:53] because people's hearts are shook up
[55:57] they are broken they are afraid
[56:02] they don't know what to even look to
[56:04] because
[56:05] now all hope is gone
[56:10] let me just read something and i'm
[56:11] closing
[56:14] i wonder let me
[56:17] read one a scripture out of the book of
[56:20] colossians
[56:28] colossians
[56:35] i don't know about you church but i'm
[56:37] really
[56:38] i'm stirred you know because i realized
[56:43] that
[56:44] we don't have time to waste anymore
[56:48] by the same time passed god went at
[56:50] english but in his last days
[56:54] we can't just continue to go on like
[56:57] everything is all right
[57:01] we got to be certain we got the goods
[57:05] i'm just not talking about a message
[57:07] that we've heard but i'm talking about
[57:09] the power of god that
[57:11] can change us prepare
[57:14] us for the rapture we get to be prepared
[57:19] for the rapture
[57:20] we got to be pressurized
[57:23] we got to really get out of ourself and
[57:27] lay us out every weight
[57:30] and understand that i don't have time
[57:34] to be dilly-dallying around in here
[57:36] anymore
[57:37] i don't have time to be wandering
[57:40] looking and saying well this and that
[57:42] no lord let me search me lord
[57:47] search my heart search
[57:50] my reigns lord if anything that's
[57:54] in me lord take it out
[57:57] make my heart pew
[58:01] lord have mercy colossians
[58:06] 1.
[58:14] 1-9 for this cause we also
[58:19] since the day we heard it do not cease
[58:22] to pray for you and desire that
[58:24] he might be filled with the knowledge of
[58:27] his will
[58:28] in all wisdom and spiritual
[58:31] understanding
[58:32] that he may walk worthy of the lord unto
[58:36] all pleasing being fruitful
[58:40] in every good work and
[58:43] increasing in the knowledge of god
[58:48] strengthened with all might according to
[58:50] his glorious power
[58:52] until all patience and long and long
[58:55] suffering with joyfulness
[58:59] redeeming our time let me read this and
[59:02] i'll turn over
[59:05] the message spoke here about wonders to
[59:08] perform
[59:09] he said it was
[59:13] it was while those went to emmaus
[59:17] along the road and began to talk about
[59:20] him
[59:20] that he stepped out of the bushes and
[59:23] walked
[59:24] with them through the day he said the
[59:26] reason
[59:29] we don't have the spiritual blessings
[59:32] we have too much time to watch
[59:34] television
[59:36] oh we don't watch television but we
[59:38] watch twitter and facebook and
[59:41] all of those things he said too much
[59:43] time to read the newspaper
[59:46] too much time to listen to something
[59:48] that we ought not to be listening to
[59:52] and we are not redeeming the time but we
[59:54] giving it
[59:55] to the things of the world instead of
[59:58] our time to the lord jesus
[1:00:00] and the bible said that man should not
[1:00:02] live by bread alone
[1:00:04] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:00:08] the mouth of god
[1:00:11] what kind of people are we to be
[1:00:15] after all that god has made known to you
[1:00:18] and i in this hour
[1:00:21] after all that god had uh revealed in
[1:00:24] this hour exposing the works of the
[1:00:26] devil
[1:00:27] letting us know about the anti-christ
[1:00:30] and
[1:00:30] exposing all those things that we can
[1:00:34] escape it
[1:00:37] and yet sometimes we seem that
[1:00:40] we not understanding that it's time to
[1:00:43] go home
[1:00:43] church let's pack up
[1:00:48] let's lay aside every weight
[1:00:52] every sin let's just let it go
[1:00:56] anything that's a hilarious then let it
[1:00:58] go
[1:01:01] you got to run this way with patience
