everyone press their way out if you have any visitors we thank the Lord for you in Jesus Christ name let us just bow again father I thank you for the word may you bless it in Jesus name amen Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fouls of the A and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his what in his own image and in is in the image of God created he him male and female created he them the female was inside the male y'all get it e was in Adam okay and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and rep plenish the Earth and sedo it and have dominion over the what and over the what and over what God bless you you may be seated God bless your word now we we were talking about in His image and in his likeness here God says he created man in his own image in our image after our likeness amen so a lot of times people look at that scripture and they see three Gods you see God the Father God the son and God the Holy Ghost but if you look at Adam all you saw is what one the Bible says here oh Israel the Lord our God is what it's one God it's not one over here and one over the left hand and the left and right hand and God said something on the throne and just one God but the mystery was Eve was the mystery of Adam being revealed are you with me the wife is the mystery of a husband are you with me so Eve was hid in Adam so you and I was hid in Christ now we want to go to First John 3 so by the grace of God image and liken remember that God created man in his own image and his own likeness [Music] amen and when God had created all things he saw it was good it was perfect isn't that right our perfection in was taken away when Adam and Eve fell in the garden isn't that right they fell because they doubt Eve doubted the word and listen to the devil tell her a lie amen and when she listened to the devil lie she did what God told her what not to do ain't that right and when we do what God tells us not to do amen but we by Nature were the children of the Wrath we were disobedient children we were born in sin shaping and iniquity oh we couldn't have him doing wrong are you with me but he Adam and Eve amen at that time they were perfect they didn't have no sin and no reason to sin amen God had given them everything ain't that right you know sometimes we feel like we got it all and we still you know want more but what more could God give them the devil told them it more it was more and sometimes I we venture out to want more more than what God gives us amen yeah but I want you to uh be confident and settle now because God has said to you and I that we're Sons and Daughters of God are you with me that means a whole lot if you were you know uh what's the Google m i mean the different ones that these billionaires trillionaires you one of their children it it would be oh then you look forward to you have an inheritance amen just being their child entitle you to certain benefits just being the Son and Daughter of God uh entitle you to certain benefits it's benefits in being the son of a billionaire are you with me and you you have benefits in being sons and is of God are you with me image and His Image and his likeness let's just look for a minute 1 John 3 And1 it says behold what manner of what don't you know that God loves you what manner of love amen God loves you what man of love the father what manner of love the father has restored upon us that we should be what that we should be called the sons of God now if you do not accept it by faith who you are then you don't you don't you don't have the benefits amen but if you believe in your heart that God by his grace have called you and made you amen that he is your father that you are Sons and Daughters of God if you believe that then the benefits of being the Son of God brother when Adam was in His image and his likeness he said I give you what I give you Dominion ain't that right over the fish of the sea the birds of the I mean to give you every creeping thing you have dominion over everything this is yours amen everything is yours amen praise God what he says you should be CAU therefore the world what he said therefore the world knows you not know knoweth us not the Bible say Jesus was in the world and the world was made V but the world the world didn't know him did he he said if you a Son of God a daughter of God the world does not know you the Bible said all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life these things are not of the father but of the world Amen If any man love the world the love of God is not in him amen so I want you to know that what the world is is the lust of the Flesh and the eyes and the pride of life amen what you see praise God is the world those temporal things the things that are not seen are Eternal are you with me and we must know amen the Bible says now not tomorrow okay let's go he said beloved what the second verse beloved what when when we get to heaven when we raptured but he says what now John said that are over 2,000 years ago uh uh telling the church now are we amen can you imagine in in in a sinful world like it is today that there'll be uh people in his life Ness and In His Image and are Sons and Daughters of God yet you can walk around with your head up praise God that God is my father who going to believe that who going to believe that praise God and see until you take ownership until you recognize who you are you'll never have the benefits as long as you don't know who you are you will not be able to use your name amen praise God because you got to recognize that your father is God Amen and if my father is God then I'm a Son of God Amen and if I'm a Son of God then I have certain benefits um it it's easy to go through life not understanding who you are and all chaotic and confused and amen mixed up tangled up messed up because you don't know who you are just a little something now look like it was we're talking about the fire of the Holy Ghost that Holy Ghost that brings you into the body of Christ when Moses saw the burning bush it was a bush it was scorched it was burnt burning but it didn't Scorch it it wasn't consumed he saw he saw that light that bush right but it was a supernatural fire can it could burn and in other words it was a fire but it wasn't burning it wasn't consuming the bush so it was a supernatural happening and you know and I'm thankful for the supernatural the holy ghost flame of fire who would come down in a human heart are you with me and burn out all sin I'm talking about being sons of God unbelief don't harm the person but to burn out all sin Lord have mercy I need that fire to burn out all sin that fire that'll burn amen Lord have mercy send the Fire Lord that it burn out all sin I need sin to be
