need healing lord like you said in your word by your stripes we are healed so lord touch all of those lord bless your word tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles tonight we turn to the book of psalms a familiar scripture psalm chapter 23. so when you gotta say amen amen and it reads the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he making me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk in the through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointed my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever amen god bless to read the word you may be seated amen tonight i'd like to speak on a little topic i entitled it never alone never alone and i was thinking of this scripture came to mind when toffee came and i like to come down and in verse 4 it said yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil amen just understanding that david here i can imagine he was a shepherd and he had to go through some dark valleys he had to go down some paths that wasn't always straight he had to go down some dangerous things to rescue his sheep but through all of that god was always with him he get always trusting in the fact that god was with him and he was never alone even though there might not have been a human in sight he was never alone god was always with him in this scripture he said he said yay though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me see he god was with him and just made me realize even through life you go through valleys you go through valleys where you where you're up sometime and then there's some real low moments and in those moments you have to remember that you're never alone he's always there with you he always has your hand he's guiding you and leading you even in the darkest times even when you feel like you're by yourself and there's nothing and you don't know how you're going to make it out those moments but god is always with you he's always there to carry you through even when you don't it don't seem like he's there he's still there listening to your prayers listening to you and hearing you and you say my prayers ain't getting through but god always hears your prayers he always when you get down on your knees and pray in earnest god always hears you he always knows what you're going through but he always gives you the ability and the tools to make it through what you're going through because he said that you're never alone let's turn to the book of first kings chapter 19. see there was someone in the bible it was a prophet in the bible that thought he was all alone he thought he was all alone god there came a persecution on the church and he was hiding out and he thought he was all alone second kings first kings chapter 19. first kings chapter 19 and verse nine and you gotta say man and he came through unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him why dost thou hear elijah what dost thou hear elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by in a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break pieces to rock before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto elijah and said what dost i'll hear elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the for the lord god of hosts because the children children of israel have forsaken their covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou coments anoint hazel to be king over syria and jehu the son of nemtshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elijah the son of shafat of abel hola shalt thou anoint to be the prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escaped the sword of hazel shall jehu slay and him that escapes from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which thou which have not bowed unto baal in every mouth which hath not kissed him amen we'll stop there but there was a key things that he said in the scripture elijah repeated multiple times he said i even i am left and they seek my life to take it away and i wrote something down i said the devil tries to get you isolated and tell you that you're the only one going through he tries to get you in a dark corner and say i'm the only one why me as brother ernest was saying the other night and he tries to get you all alone or make you feel like you're the only one that's going through the things that you're going through but jesus said i'll never leave you nor forsake you so you don't have to worry about being alone and being the only one you there's always someone else that's fighting the elijah saw that he wasn't the only one god had seven thousand out there but he seemed like he was isolated and by himself and so he was the only one that was going through but he was never alone there were more that was out there that was praying there was more that was out there that was living right there was more that was out there that was worshiping god and doing what god asked them to do they was never alone there was no one there was never elijah was never by himself but because of where he was standing he could only see his problems because of where he was hiding he could only see his circumstances he could only see what he was going through but he wasn't alone there were many out there that was still fighting there were many out there that was still progressing and doing the right thing and he always knew that god was with him no matter if he felt alone god was still there in his midst he said in matthew lord i will be with you even until the end that's the great commission in matthew chapter 28 see god said if you go if that he will be with you even until the end until the end of everything until the end of time he will be with you that you don't have to worry about am i alone am i by myself and i came to the second part and i said i want to ask everyone the question do you trust them do you trust him see many of times when you feel alone is because you've lost faith you've lost trust in something something that you held on to and now it's no longer on the level that you thought it was but i want to question you and ask you do you trust him because he said he would never leave you so do you trust him in the moments that you in your deepest moments do you still trust him when you down there and you're not feeling good do you still trust him that he's still your healer when you're going through mind battles do you still believe that he's a deliverer do you trust him that he will bring you through that you are never alone and he's still there fighting with you even in those and he can deliver you from anything all you have to do is pray and ask him lord take this away from you lord take this that i'm going through and and lord you fight this battle it's not mine and lord i came to the altar to leave it there and i didn't want to pick it back up many times i said we come to the altar and we leave it there but then we start to think about it it's brought back to our mind of what what it was and we still try to figure it out but sometimes you got to leave it in god's hand and let him work it out not you figure it out but let god work it out because you're not alone he'll fight you about us he didn't say you fight your battles he said i'll fight your battles but you got to give the battle to him before you before you you can't win the battle if you're still fighting but you gave it to him that's like you going you're fighting someone that's bigger and stronger so you go get your friend and you say hey you bigger than me you take my battle but then you still jump in the middle of the fight why would you do that when you got someone there that said i'll fight all your battles and not only that i win i don't ever lose i always win see you can know that you're never alone in the battles that you fight and the things that you go through it's just maybe your perspective it's maybe because you haven't went to the one and said lord do i truly trust you do i truly trust that you're going to work all things to my good do i truly trust that no matter what you working this out no even though i can't see how it's going to work out but do i trust you that you are going to work it out that you are going to see me through these moments that you are going to strengthen me in my time and need that you're going to provide when i need you to provide lord do i trust you that's the question do you trust him in proverbs it's one of my favorite scriptures he said trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to not own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct our path and i always like to remember that scripture because it's something that you gotta sometimes quote daily to remember to remind yourself it's a daily reminder lord i still gotta trust you i may not understand how it's gonna work out but lord i still trust you because you you said in your word that if i lean not into all my understandings in all that ways acknowledge him and he will direct my path like you will do it lord not me not me doing it but you will do it and i look in the scriptures and i seen in luke chapter 7 there was a centurion that had a servant and the servant was sick so he went to jesus and he said and he said lord my servant is sick and jesus said well well let's go down to him and let's lay hands but he said lord i believe in you i trust you so much that all i need you to do is speak the word i don't need you to go there to the place where this where it's happening lord just speak the word and i believe that that that he will be healed and jesus said he spoke the word he said i have found no greater faith in all of israel see see sometimes when that was a trust that that centurion had in the word and sometimes god asked us to trust his word the same way you may not see or understand it but he said trust it and the centurion he trusted it that it was going to do what god sent it out of his mouth to do because it couldn't turn return to him boy he trusted that these things were going to return and now when he got back home that situation was going to be worked out that situation was going to be taken care of he and and i asked the question do you trust him on that level that when you look at your problem you say lord it's yours and then you leave it there do you trust him on the level that lord i'm not alone in this i'm not i'm not alone in fighting this battle lord you got this battle and it's yours and i trust you to see me through i don't know how it's going to work out how it's going to turn out but i know that it's going to be for my good i know that when you get done working it's going to be for my good i can step in and mess something up but i know that you're gonna work it out so it's for my good i can go in there and maybe say this and say that and turn it all the way around and it'd be worse than it was but you can turn it around for the good no matter how bad it looks lord i trust you i trust you to do what you said you would do in your word and everything that you said you would i can hold on to it the prophet of god said i can rest on that i can rest on these things that you put in your word because it's a promise to me it's a promise to abraham seat and all this the seat after it's a promise that you're going to do what you said you were going to do and that i can't i can't worry about how it's going to happen i can't you waste time on worrying about what's going to happen i got to leave it in your hand to say whatever happens it's your will whatever happens you meant if you meant it to happen whether it looks like i'm struggling to make it maybe those are the times i read something recently it said the days that break you are the days that make you it's the mo it's your darkest times that show you what your character is truly made of it's those moments where you're in the valleys that make you appreciate the mountaintop so much more when you get done fighting and you're on when you're in your lowest moments and god bring you through you can always look back and say lord you brought me through this lord you brought me through that and so i know you'll bring me through to what's coming next i know that you can provide i know that you can do these things i know that you're a healer cause when i had a cold you healed me when i got a little bit sicker you healed me so if it's something greater i know you can still do it because you're the god you're the same yesterday today and forever and i don't have to worry about what happened yesterday because i know that you are the able you're the god that always provides i can hold and hold on to that and i can trust in that that lord you able and your provider and you able to do what you said you wouldn't do see a lot of that's why i asked the question do you trust them and it was been the thing that god has been working on me you said that you you laid these situations in my hand but what level is your faith and trust in me because many times we get in life and we want things to happen a certain way or we see this path and we want it to happen this way but if it don't go that way it throws us off kilter it throws us all where we thought we was going and our trajectories and where we thought things would go in life but in those moments i have to remember lord do i trust you do i trust you in the moments when the path don't look like it's going the right way do i trust you in the moments where i can't tell you what's going to happen in the future when i can't see where this is going but do i trust you and know that i'm not alone that you promised to fight all my battles but i got to give them to you so and get down on my knees and get a get a prayer through to god and say lord i trust you i trust you to see me through i trust that you no matter what i'm going through you're going to make it through you're going to allow me to make it through and it's going to work to my good see you have to remember that it no matter what you may go through no matter what may be happening to you lord do i trust you do i trust you and remember that when the devil tries to defeat you further and said no i trust god when he tries to take you further into deeper and darker places lord i still trust you joe before it all before the sun rise it's always the darkest right before the sun rise it's always the darkest so sometimes it maybe seems like it's getting darker but the light is coming the light is right on the way but you got to break through so many times you get you get right to the edge of your breakthrough and never cross over because you say that's it i've taken enough i've been through enough i'm not going through no more but that was right in that moment was the moment that if you would have pushed a little further god was about to do great things god was going to do great things if you trusted him just a little bit more than where you are today so i asked the question to you do you trust him do you trust that you're never alone do you trust in the fact that lord i know that you're always right there beside me david did david didn't know that one day he was going to face goliath but the trustee he had in god bringing him through the valleys trust that he had in god to carry him through the mountain through the lion through the bear through through the lion and through the bear it was the same faith that he said lord i trust that you're gonna defeat the goliath i have no doubt that goliath is going to fall i have no doubt that lord you're going to destroy this this this thing that's in my way he had no doubt because he trusted him he trusted him in the valley he trusted him through the lion and the bear and now he got to goliath and he said i'm not worried about you i've seen how much god has already done so i can keep going and i can keep trusting i can keep believing because god has brought me too far for me to go back now for me to start doubting that lord oh i'm scared now no i ain't scared no more because i haven't seen how far that trust in you has brought me i can keep going i can keep believing that no matter what else comes in my way lord you're able to take me through it lord no matter how big he looks and how small i am i know that you are greater because i'm never alone that you will god this stone you will take out all the enemies that's in my way so i can believe in that and i can trust on that and then and david he didn't worry about goliath and he said no he said don't worry about that because i know that if goliath falls everyone else gonna scatter if i can take out goliath all the philistines started running because that was the one that was holding them together that was the one thing that was the one problem that had no multitude back behind it but when the one problem fell because you trusted god all the mother things started to move out the way and it was a vast you had victory over many different things that was in the way because god you could try you trusted him through those moments and god defeated goliath and then after that the rest of the philistines were yours but you have to defeat goliath you got to trust in god to defeat the goliath but god has brought you through things that you can trust in and say he brought me through this and it may seem small but it's just it's the small victories that eventually win the war it ain't always the massive ones it's the small victories you're piling on victories and say lord you brought me through this you brought me through that and you brought me through this and by the time i get done thanking you for what all you brought me through and what all you're going to do i don't even think about my problem because you brought me through so much you brought me through so much this that i can it's increasing my face to remember where you brought me from remember what you've done for me and it's increasing me to know that if he did bring me through that i might have forgotten about that but lord thank you for bringing it back to my memory that what you did for me yesterday you're the same god of yesterday you're the same god today and you'll be the same god tomorrow so if you're the same god i can trust you i can trust and believe that you're going to continue to deliver me you're going to continue to bring me through these things because these things take you greater and farther and farther in god that trust in him takes you further and further in god even further than you thought that you would go but god can take you more and take you to higher and deeper higher heights and deeper depths and that if he bought you through the valley yesterday he can take you through the valley that comes tomorrow he can take you through the valley that comes the next day because everything ain't always sunshine and roses life is full of problems but those things that that are problems they come to build your character they come to make you the person that you are today they come to make you the person that you will be because of those problems and god can use any one that he wants to use if you let him if you trust him and say lord things might have happened these things might have occurred and life may seem to be unfair there are moments in life that you may seem like why me like elijah said i'm the only one he was in his lowest moment he said i'm the only one but god had to remind him that you're not the only one that's fighting you're not the only one i said i said even in in the moments that when god drops someone on your heart to pray for him pray for him in the moments because you never know what a person may be going through and you never know who prayer is the one that brings them through that moment you never know what god is using and pressing on your heart to do to help someone else so those are moments i heard this story and i'll tell it and because it was really packed full and it meant something said there was this man he was traveling down he was a missionary he's traveling down a road and he met this guy on the road and he was sick and hurt and he helped him almost like a good samaritan and when he got done on the road and he went about his way well that night he had to sleep on the road and it was dangerous and there were bandits and stuff on the road but that night he got he got he got there and he slept and he slept safely and then he went on about his way to the next city well in the next city he got to there and there were and there was the man on the side of the road that he had helped and he said he came up to him and he said he said i just want to let you know that last night me and my friends were going to rob you we was going to take everything that you had but when we went to take up there we saw that there were 26 men guards around you now i'm not a missionary he knew that he was all alone he knew that there was no one else out there so he said he questioned 26 that's an odd number and he said well he went back home and he made it all the way back home to the church and it was pressed on him and he told the story to the church how how the lord protected him on the road and telling the testimony and there was a brother that stood up in the church and he said pastor a mission or a missionary he said when did this happen what day what time and the pastor said it happened for example on thursday at nine o'clock and so he said well he said pastor i want to let you know a missionary i want to let you know that at that day and at that time the lord pressed on my heart to pray for you and then i called around to to a couple of brothers and ask them to pray with me and then sort of so the missionary as he said with all y'all that stood would stand up that prayed for him and then and he got around and he looked and a group of people stood up and he started counting and it was the exact number of the people that the thieves saw guarding him it was the exact same number it was the exact same and he said see god always does things for reasons god always has a purpose and sometimes he use others to show you that you're not alone he uses others to show you that you can still trust in him and then he allows you to see it that he's still there he's still watching over you he's still leading you he's still guiding you and it increases your faith every day to remember that no matter what you may be going through no matter what how you how things may be going in life that you can still trust them you can still believe that god is still here with me god is able to take me through and able to take all my burdens and he's able to carry me through whatever i may be going through amen i appreciate the word tonight amen never alone amen i just thank the lord for the word that we heard and you know it's just a blessing that i was sitting there and and he's ministering i was thinking about that footprints on the standard time and how you know the man said lord in all of my hardest moments in life said i only seen one set of footprints and he began to tell him said son that's when i was carrying you because you know we we feel that way sometimes until we understand who god is and and he's like he said he'll never leave you one thing i thought about too is as you know when he was talking to joshua knows after moses had left was gone he took moses off the scene one of the things i always looked at what he told him he said i won't fail you and i said there is no failure in god not only that he says i ain't going to leave you nor forsake you but i ain't going to fail you so i want you to you know put your trust in me and i know that you know tonight we trusting in god and for all things you know i was saying something the other day and when we were doing our studies and uh it's something that struck out to me about a lot of times we look at god as being the impersonal god i was saying that tuesday we look at god as being impersonal we just see him as the great creator that created the heavens and earth and but for some reason in our minds thinking that way he seems we push him far off from us this great creator he's sometimes unapproachable or sometimes he's so great that he don't have time to mingle in my matters but he is great he is the almighty god he is all-powerful that great creator but that same one i like how i believe it was john in book of first john how he says you know we heard it from the beginning we've seen it we with our own hands have we handled it because god this great creator not only is he so great but he wants to have a personal relationship with you as well he got time out of all of his greatness hallelujah to come down and see about you out all his greatness and i believe david says when i consider the heavens and the stars the work of our fingers he says what is a man that thou art that thou art mindful of him this great creator come on the one that bridged the way back to him that was closed up from sin this great creator this great savior but yet he wants to have a personal relationship with you and i said in our studies is saying you know the way we thinking that he's so far off he said that's the wrong way of thinking we got to correct that way you know when you think god is so far off that's why you don't pray as you ought to pray that's why you don't seek god's face as you ought to because sometimes you think oh he but but god cares you know you know the bible says he cares he he cares for you to cast all your cares upon the lord because he cares for you this great yes he got time to come down and get in your business he got time to come down and see about your matters but we don't we don't we our thinking is all messed up we see him too far off but when we realize that he's that same that same god remember he came down and he spoke to moses didn't he and began to tell him i hear the the cries of my people i know what they're going through i hear him crying and tell him i come down now to come see about him that great creator yes he got time to come down and see about you that same one he had time to come in the cooler day hallelujah and go talk to abraham i said we got to start looking at god as not being unapproachable or impersonal but being a personal god that when you get down lord i need your help too god i got these struggles i got these battles i got these trials and lord i need your help god you're that same god i know you're powerful i know that you're still a creator you're still a deliverer and a healer where is this great god come on if god be god and where is all his miracles that we heard about sometimes you know you find that he's a personal god you approach him in that way come on i remember many times people talk to me and maybe dump all their problems off on me like say hey this is what i'm going through so when i let them vent what they call it but when they get done i said not the same way you talked to me don't you know god heard it but i can't do nothing for you but pray with you i said you got to get down on your knees for yourself and the same way you talk to me you felt confident in me because you thinking that i'm somebody that you can talk to i say don't you know god is somebody that you can talk to god is somebody that you can walk in the day with come on not just just say at certain times but everywhere you go don't you know god is somebody that you can talk to god is somebody you can confide in and ask god what's your will in this situation god how you want me to move as we were saying last week did you pray about it i said many times people don't pray because they're afraid of the answer that god gonna give they don't want the answer that god gonna give them i said many times people today they fall in love with the very things that they know destroy many men or women or preachers or whatever they fall in love still with those things because they can't help themselves it's in their nature to seek out the carnal things to their own destruction so that's why we we pray and we say god thank you for giving us a new nature and the new nature is going to seek you out to the things of god not the things of the world not the things that destroy men even in your flesh when it rise up that nature that's inside you will be quick to find somewhere to get along with god and say god ridden me of these thoughts ridden me of these desires come on i don't have the will to fight myself but not my will lord but let thy will be done you know when jesus in the garden of gethsemane he said lord if it be possible let this cup pass because it was a real hard trial that he had to face but then he begins to say lord not my will but let thy will be done come on and that's what we want in our lives god's will to be done you know the bible says our brother caleb read it trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to that own understanding but in all thy ways acknowledge him and he gonna direct your paths you know did you pray about it hallelujah because he gonna direct your paths and all your ways acknowledge him now because many times we made major decisions and we didn't pray about it we didn't ask god about it because it's what we wanted what we desired was afraid of what his answer was going to be but if we'd only asked god about it come on then god could have led us in the ways that he won't and that's what it is i was saying uh last week i said the thing is you keep doing those things and i said sooner or later you'll get yourself in the place the way you ain't gonna come back from that same hard or sad ain't it but it's the truth anyhow why because why would we venture out on our own when we got somebody that can lead us away oh we like sheep the bible say have gone astray come on but yet we got a shepherd that calls us by name you know the bible said a good shepherd know the sheep he know him by name come on and he calleth them out the bible say he called them and he leadeth them out jesus said that and i like that hallelujah don't you ain't you glad tonight to know that god knows your name you know out of all the world that's why i said he's not some unapproachable god out all the world you know he'll turn the world upside down because he knows you you were ordained you were elected of god so he changed the course of history i believe that just to save you he'll stop the hand of judgment when the devil want to cut your life off because you deserve to be cut off but yet you were the elect of god and god knew that one day you'll hear his voice one day when he called you would answer so he held back the winds hallelujah he held back the storms because i got a child in there he came down to see about you didn't he you know i look at my life that way god came to see about me i was never alone as brother caleb said you were never alone god came to see about me one of my somebody told me once man when you left everything fell apart but you know what god came to see about me god was with me the whole time don't you know god was there the whole time waiting for you to call on him waiting in line do y'all believe that tonight i thank god i says that i wrote something down i said if we only knew how much he cares if you only knew how much god cares you have not because your ass not come on you know i was say this and i'll sit down about this little story one time and how did the guy say you know we got up to heaven and they had all these little warehouses just telling a story and says that you know he found one room or a house or something in the warehouse and had all these gifts in it and he and the boxes had his name on it or so however he tell it and he said lord what are these he said these are the blessings that god had in store for you while you was on earth but you never asked for them you know and i said a lot of times god don't you know god i want to give you exceeding abundantly above all you can ask or think he owned every cattle on the hill don't he but sometimes you got to go to guard and ask god about it how many feel like doing that tonight i said you're never alone come on as our brother caleb said that encourages you know we found that out finding that out still right now but early in our christian journey when everybody forsook you forsake you and forsook you or whatever and walked on then you got in that lonely place seemed to be lonely but then you found out that jesus was a friend like no other he took up time with you people don't sometimes i've seen it people don't take up time with you people love being around you sometimes and you're healthy and god you can do for them but fall on your sick bed sometimes get that place the way you can't do for them i seen it family all these things get to that place now come on sometimes they won't come see about you let alone pray for you but nevertheless in that time don't you know god's still there don't you know don't you know god never left he's still right there but he wanted to show you something that man will fail you but god won't i'll forget about you you know sometimes you think people won't i'll forget about you but god will never forget about you that's why your trust need to be in not in a church building not in a man or any such thing but your trust need to be in god and god alone come on because you don't know what tomorrow bring but when tomorrow comes you know that god is still there amen praise god amen never alone amen we thank god for the word tonight and thank god for brother ernest and recalling different ones appreciate you never alone i wrote down some things today um none of them is lost jesus said and gave me that consolation because sometimes you you want to save everybody you want everybody to be saved and you try to reach out and you know i was telling brother nathan and thanks down to mullins last night that says god love is unconditional he loves us in spite it's not on how good we were and how good we are his love is unconditional he didn't die for us because we were so good or because of what we done but while we were yet sinners god died for the ungodly and i thank god that jesus came and thought enough of us when we were alienated when we were fall from god the enemies in our minds by wicked words but yet he thought enough about us to die on the cross for us he cared enough about us when we didn't even care about our own soul he still loved us in spite of he cared enough about us i said how much he forgave us how much more should we forgive one another how much more should we forgive one another you know sometimes we we our our forgiveness is limited that's why jesus said till 70 times 70 that's how far we ought to go amen that's in a day you say as your heavenly father forgave you so you can forgive men their trespasses so by the grace of god when we think about it amen we can bear one another burdens let's bear one another amen because we're living in a time where the love of many would wax coal and because the love of many waxing coal we got to have that unconditional love but we can't have it in ourselves the only way we're going to have the kind of love that god has we got to have the holy ghost other than that our love is going to be limited it's going to be limited to loving them that love us or that we think they love us and those that are concerned about us and care about us but those that really hate us and despise us are you able to love them unconditionally also those that you think hate you don't like you don't care nothing about you can you love them unconditional and that's what it is love is that unconditional love that's what god wants to see in his people that you can have enough love that you can cover multitude of sin our mistakes and our faults you can love us enough to cover up all of that and that's what god wants to see in his people i'll tell you if we're going to get out here in a rapture in faith and get out here and be caught up to meet him in the air our love got to be unconditional and you can't have it on your own it's got to be god god god pay love god coming out in you doing it for you because you cannot do it on your own god bless you let us stand praise god oh jesus there is no pain jesus can feel and there is [Music] according to his power for the battle [Music] is is [Music] that is [Music] no matter what [Music] you're going
