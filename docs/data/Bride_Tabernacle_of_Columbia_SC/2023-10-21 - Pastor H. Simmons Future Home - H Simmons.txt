bless your word word today in Jesus name we pray amen Book of Revelation 21 it's good to have something that we're looking forward to that's worth it's worth our pressing our way to the house of the Lord Lord is worth the kind of life we live that God has promised us he says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth was passed away and there were no more sea and our John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride of johnfer her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the tabernac of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things have passed away and he that set it upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto him that is of thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and the unbelieving and the Abominable and murderers and H mongers and Sorcerers and idolators and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burn with fire and brimstone which is the second death may God bless the this word you may be seated you know I said on last night I said the people that's on their way to the Lake of Fire are preparing themselves for the lake they're actually getting ready and preparing themselves for the place that they think they want to go but we're talking about our future home you and I but there is a place that the wicked is going to go and there's a place that the righteous is going to go I'm going tell you something people are dressing like they are going somewhere they actually uh of being so inspired by the underworld of the pits of the demonic spirits of the Satan till they are actually becoming one with the uh demon powers so much and so they tattoo themselves even in their faces the Bible tells us not to cut ourselves and put marks in our flesh but people do they pay God in attention no they don't want to pay God even so-called Christians are putting Mark in their flesh and they they were saying don't put marks after the dead and all so there are people of putting marks and uh family members and all kind of things that they do tattoo and they're piercing themselves through with all kind of piing and stuff like that being anointed by demons to do these things and when you look at them if you actually will just look you might run for your life but it become normal that we see amen what we might would see in a nightmare or a bad dream we see it walk in the streets now we say God have mercy because people think that this is nice looking because the devil has so blinded their eyes and inspired them from the pits of hell today cannot understand that they're preparing themselves for where they are going and they don't want to go there but because they don't want God they are going there anyhow people dress like they don't care the Bible says it's abomination in the sight of God for the woman to we that which pertain it to a man and if a man put on a woman's garment it's Abomination but folk don't care they're going to do what they want it's time for us to understand you going to prepare yourself for your home home with God are we going to disrespect God and we going to prepare ourselves to go the other way it's easy to see a man with a dress on and he says I'm fully man these to see things that maybe uh 50 years ago SE 75 years ago people wouldn't dare do people don't mind walking the streets in they under closed what we would call under closed maybe 50 60 years ago now it's the norm even Grandmama got them on future home where you going brothers and sister we got to get ready if we want to go to heaven we're going to have to say holy ghost I need you Holy Ghost I need you I need not the preacher to tell me how to regress not the Deacon to tell me how to dress not mama daddy I need God to tell me I want to please you lord it's coming down to our who you want to please amen I want to please God God tell me how to live I'm going to heaven are you with me I said future home it's worth it to go to heaven amen I'm I'm talking about the little things that God ask us to do it's not going to make God any more God than he already is amen God is God and it doesn't matter if you do right or wrong God Still Remains God are you with me but what he asks us to do is for our own good to benefit us are you with me you're not asking you to do something that's going to make God Amen a bigger God than he is so I'm saying to you future home where you want to go now I'm going read that e verse says but the fearful and the what [Music] unbelieving and the bombable the Bible says abomination in the sight of God for Deuteronomy 22 and5 for a woman the way that which pertain it to a man and the man to put on a woman's garment are you with me somebody said everything anybody can do anything now but I believe that God that's why God I believe that's why we had to have a prophet in this age somebody to set the church in order and I'm I you know somebody had to set it in order God had to have something to judge Man by he had to have somebody to say this is thus said the Lord this is the word so oh no I don't believe in that I believe every man do what he want to do I'm so glad that I God took it out of my hand it make my work a little bit easier cuz I all I got to do is say what the bible say is't that right and I know God going to back up his word are you with me you know sometime folk can get mad at you won't you get mad at God he said it I'm mad at that preacher I preach should never said that get mad at God God said it it's it's in the Bible I'm mad at that preacher yeah and sometime folks that supposed to be saved and Christian they get mad too talk when they got the Holy Ghost oh you know let God tell them I'm telling them if I tell you the truth if I don't tell you the truth then when I meet God he said why didn't you tell the people when I meet God God going to say then you say you said I called you the preach didn't you and then you don't tell the people the truth I'm going charge you and my Bishop used to say he said the blood going to be off my hand it's on your hand cuz I'm going to tell you get the blood off my hand ain't that right see if you want to go to heaven you got to get ready to go there you got to get prepared God this is dressing room my old Bishop said we in the dressing room we dressing up we getting ready to go are you with me you in the dressing room you dressing up putting on your weding garment praise God your weding garment you're going to be clothed in his righteousness praise God you got to put on this garment put on this wedding garment when God look at you he going to see the word oh Lord Lord have mercy God is good okay they he says but the fearful and the what unbelieving people do what they want to do cuz they don't believe person say I believe God God I believe in God I Believe In My Savior I Believe In My Healer I believe in my all and all he said if you love me and I love him he said if you love me what keep the word ain't that right I mean y'all got to stop just patting folk on the back when they doing wrong y'all got to tell the folk the truth you God ain't just holding me responsible God G to hold you responsible because you won't tell the truth oh that's my mama that's my

with me the fear the fearful and the unbelieving and the what and the abom and the murder and the what come on say again say a lot of enough ain't that right if you don't believe the words if you get
