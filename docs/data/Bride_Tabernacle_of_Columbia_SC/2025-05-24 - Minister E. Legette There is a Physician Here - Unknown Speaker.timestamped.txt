[35:56] I was laying on bed the other day. I
[35:58] must have forgot all about that song. I
[36:00] was laying on the bed the other day
[36:02] meditating on the Lord and I I just kept
[36:04] saying, "God, I trust you." Amen. Amen.
[36:08] Sometimes we say you don't know where to
[36:10] go. He might show you things to come,
[36:13] but he don't always show you how you
[36:15] going to get through it. Amen.

[36:40] good. Tonight, we want to look at the
[36:43] book of Jeremiah 8. by the grace of God.
[36:46] And we'll drop down to
[36:47] the we just go down to the to the 17th
[36:59] verse. We start let's we can just start
[37:02] here at the 20th verse. Let's cut the
[37:03] time
[37:05] short. 8 and 20. You got to say amen.
[37:08] Amen. And it reads, "The harvest is
[37:11] passed. The summer is ended, and we are
[37:14] not saved. For the hurt of the daughter
[37:16] of my people am I hurt? I am black.
[37:20] Astonishment have taken hold on me. Is
[37:23] there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no
[37:26] physician there? Why then is not Why
[37:30] then is not the health of the daughter
[37:32] of my people recovered?" May God bless
[37:35] you. You may be seated. Amen.
[37:38] Tonight we want to talk here just for a
[37:40] moment. Amen. Won't be long. And I
[37:43] entitled it there is a physician here.
[37:46] Amen. Amen. There is a physician
[37:49] here. You know I think I know God God
[37:53] has hallelujah been blessing us. Amen. I
[37:56] says you know here God has sending
[37:59] Jeremiah out to cry you know against the
[38:01] sins of the land in that day.
[38:05] And right here he's saying, you know,
[38:07] he's I guess standing wherever he's
[38:09] standing at
[38:10] prophesying, he's saying, you know, is
[38:12] there no bomb in Gilead, right? Is there
[38:14] no
[38:15] physician? Because looking at the
[38:18] condition of the people, you would think
[38:21] there wasn't one.
[38:22] Amen. But not only is there a physician,
[38:26] was there a physician here? There. And
[38:29] as I say tonight, there is a physician
[38:31] here, but he is the greatest physician.
[38:33] Amen.
[38:35] He's the greatest of all, right? But yet
[38:38] the people are still, you know,
[38:40] sometimes, you know, I I remember I was
[38:43] reading in second Kings, I I believe it
[38:45] was in in uh the king of Samaria and how
[38:49] he that war with Moab and fell through
[38:52] the the roof of what whatever it was,
[38:54] and hurt himself. So he he sent his
[38:56] people to go ask of of the God of
[39:01] acron will he get up off of that bed.
[39:04] But God, you know, gave Elijah a word.
[39:06] And that word he came to him and met
[39:08] him. He said, "Is there no God in
[39:10] Israel?" Come on. That was an insult. He
[39:14] said to him that there is a God there.
[39:18] But yet you going, he said, "And why you
[39:20] going to ask
[39:21] Bible?" Right? And many of
[39:24] times you'll look at some of the things
[39:28] of of of lives and the the the judgments
[39:33] I mean or or the uh you know things they
[39:35] choose and you might say is there no do
[39:39] they not know it's a god?
[39:41] Amen. Do they not have a god that they
[39:44] can go to? Cuz of the choice they made.
[39:47] You would think they didn't have a god
[39:48] they can go to. Come on. But we go to
[39:51] sometimes everybody else but God, right?
[39:55] We talk amongst everybody else talk and
[39:57] make decisions swift whatever and say,
[39:59] "Oh, that's just minor, minor, minor."
[40:01] But you know the Bible says to trust in
[40:04] the Lord with what? All thine heart and
[40:06] lean not to your own understanding. But
[40:09] in all of your ways, right? All of your
[40:12] ways. Say that's a minor. This is
[40:13] something small. All of your ways do
[40:15] what? Acknowledge him and he'll do what?
[40:17] He'll direct you, won't he? I don't know
[40:20] about you, but we need direction of the
[40:22] Holy Ghost. Amen. I says I was I was
[40:25] sharing uh I said, you know, the Lord
[40:28] sometimes he'll do supernatural things
[40:31] and show you things to come, show you
[40:33] times that's coming up ahead, but he
[40:36] don't necessarily always show you how
[40:38] you going to get through them, right?
[40:42] And sometimes you say, "I know the
[40:43] battle that's coming. I know the storm
[40:45] that's raging." But then you get down on
[40:47] your knees and you start praying, Lord,
[40:49] give me the wisdom to get through it.
[40:51] Come on. Cuz whatever you're trying to
[40:54] uh get out of me or whatever you're
[40:55] trying to do in me, I don't want to have
[40:57] to deal with this again. So Lord, help
[41:01] me to get through it. Amen. So that's
[41:03] what we pray, Lord, as we see things uh
[41:07] uh coming down to its climax in your
[41:09] natural natural lives, right? in your in
[41:11] your closer families everything around
[41:14] the world itself you say God this is the
[41:17] time now I can't live loosely right but
[41:20] this is the time now that I I have to
[41:22] really draw from the wisdom of God right
[41:26] really draw from not only his wisdom but
[41:29] you got to draw from his strength amen
[41:32] hallelujah so I says that you know he
[41:35] was asking the question is there no
[41:36] physician here you know he is the great
[41:39] physician do y'all Y'all believe that
[41:41] tonight. Amen. You know, I was I was
[41:44] thinking the other day they called us in
[41:46] and my grandmother down there, but they
[41:48] were saying, "Anybody want to come see
[41:49] her, come see her." You know, didn't
[41:50] think she going to make it through the
[41:51] night. You go there, she's just sitting
[41:54] there and uh she hadn't really been
[41:56] eating in a long time. So, everything is
[41:59] look like it's taking its toll. But
[42:02] after everybody done came through and
[42:04] praying, Amen. After all, everybody came
[42:07] through and prayed and did all that, the
[42:10] next day my mom them called me and was
[42:12] like, "Yeah, she up. She want to talk to
[42:14] you." So I I'm thinking, "Yeah, okay."
[42:18] So they put her on the phone and she
[42:20] talking just you wouldn't know she's in
[42:21] the
[42:22] hospital. And she kept saying,
[42:24] "Jermaine, she called me Jermaine, I
[42:26] want you to come see me." And that got
[42:27] me because she don't really remember who
[42:29] I am for months
[42:30] now. And they said she done drunk
[42:33] coffee, been eating. And then she told
[42:34] me while I was on the phone, I'm hungry.
[42:36] Right. And several people saying that's
[42:39] all she been saying how hungry she was.
[42:40] But they said they couldn't give her no
[42:41] solid food, whatever being. So she said,
[42:44] I want you to come see me tonight. And
[42:45] it's it's, you know, about late already
[42:49] late in the evening. I said, "Grandma, I
[42:50] can't come tonight." She said, "Well, I
[42:51] want you to come in the morning, you
[42:53] know." So I said, "Okay, I'll come in
[42:54] the morning." So I end up going down
[42:56] there uh Tuesday. Got off work that
[42:58] Tuesday morning. But and I went down
[43:01] there. When I went down there and seen
[43:02] her, she looked like she kind of went
[43:04] back to what she was Sunday. But a lot
[43:07] of times people say, "Oh, they're going
[43:10] to have one one last thing." And and
[43:12] they come up with these sayings and some
[43:14] of them may be true, but what I look at
[43:16] is this. All it takes is for God to move
[43:19] his hand.
[43:21] Come on. We can put it on the wisdom of
[43:23] doctors, science, all this and and and
[43:25] and great sayings, but what I look at is
[43:28] like this. All it takes is for God to
[43:30] move his hand. God to move his hand to
[43:33] restore appetite, restore mind, restore
[43:35] all if he want to do it now. Come on.
[43:38] Come on. That's right. Now I said that
[43:41] because just looking at that situation,
[43:43] that's I you know, you always believe
[43:45] that. But I says that God's will going
[43:47] to be done, you know, in every
[43:49] situation. But what I'm talking about to
[43:51] you personally tonight, God has complete
[43:53] control. Amen. But what happens? We
[43:56] don't we don't remember that he is the
[43:58] great physician. Come on. God can move
[44:02] mountains, right? Charlton was telling
[44:04] me the testimony of the person that got
[44:06] healed from cancer. I think Sister Anna
[44:08] was talking about the other night. But
[44:10] God moves mountains, don't he? He's He's
[44:13] still the great physician, ain't he?
[44:16] Come on. He's still the healer. But see
[44:18] what it is today, people's minds are are
[44:21] they they going so much into because of
[44:23] they know so much, know this, and know
[44:24] that. This is how it always been. This
[44:26] right. But the thing I'm looking at is
[44:29] it's not in what we know. That's right.
[44:31] And what we can do physically, but
[44:34] everything is moving by the power of
[44:36] God. Come on. Everything.
[44:40] Come on. Not by you ain't about the one
[44:43] that can run and all that. It's by the
[44:44] power of God. Come on. That all these
[44:47] things are moving. So we we start living
[44:49] life everything you know it is moving by
[44:52] the power of God. Right. And I said,
[44:54] "Lord, that's what it is." See, we come
[44:57] to that place. I was I was sharing with
[44:58] Charlotte today about something, you
[45:00] know. I says, "This situation right
[45:01] here, I ain't worried about that because
[45:03] God is the righteous judge." That person
[45:06] right there or that situation is can
[45:09] only do what God allowed them to do.
[45:11] Amen. Come on. And that's for real.
[45:13] Amen. I They only can do only power they
[45:16] got is the power that God give them.
[45:18] Amen. And the and the the judgment that
[45:21] God's making, he's a righteous. I know
[45:23] his his decision, the judgment he make
[45:25] is right. Amen. Come on. So when it when
[45:28] it all comes down to the end, I can say,
[45:30] "Lord, thank you." Come on. Because you
[45:33] did right, didn't you? Come on. And all
[45:37] things Hallelujah. I'm going to give
[45:39] thanks, right? Come on. Because all
[45:41] things work together for what? Good of
[45:43] them. Oh, look at where you at. Come on
[45:45] now. Uh-uh. All things work together for
[45:47] the good of them. Come on. We're not Say
[45:49] we ain't doing that. Come on. All
[45:51] things. Come on. Whether you're up,
[45:54] whether you're down, it's working for
[45:55] your good. Whether it got worse, whether
[45:57] it didn't, it's working for your good
[45:59] anyhow. Come on. But the thing is, I I
[46:02] says, I don't know about I I says, we
[46:04] come to church, right?
[46:07] But do you really believe that God is
[46:09] all powerful? Come on. Many people go to
[46:12] church, but they don't believe in the
[46:14] supernatural. Come on. So, not to
[46:16] believe in it, they don't look for it.
[46:18] Right. Amen. They look for sayings and
[46:20] all these things. But I says if God ever
[46:22] was God, he's still God. Right? Come on.
[46:25] And his power is the same. He don't fade
[46:27] or or lose with time. It don't matter
[46:29] what nobody says. He is the same
[46:32] yesterday, today, and what? Forever. The
[46:35] things he done, he's still capable of
[46:37] doing them. Come on. And can't nobody
[46:40] take you away from that. Once God do
[46:43] something, that's why you need God to do
[46:44] something for you. Come on. That's why
[46:46] it's got to become a personal
[46:48] relationship. Cuz mama gone, grandma
[46:50] gone, whoever gone. Then do you know God
[46:52] for yourself? Come on. You got to know
[46:55] him for yourself. Hallelujah. But in
[46:58] order to do that, he's got to do
[46:59] something personally for you, right?
[47:02] Come on. And then when when God do see,
[47:04] nobody can't shake you away from that
[47:05] because you know it was God. Come on.
[47:08] And it's still God right now. But I
[47:10] says, you know, there is a physician
[47:11] here. Come on. God is still still
[47:13] healing. Now, now there's two types of
[47:17] healing we can look at. Uh uh sickness
[47:19] is natural and spiritual. Come on. But
[47:22] to be healed in the natural and yet your
[47:25] soul is sick didn't do you no good.
[47:27] That's right. Did it? Come on. I was
[47:30] thinking of somebody just the other day
[47:34] he got rushed to the hospital and and uh
[47:36] said he almost hemorrhaged to death and
[47:39] is in ICU and it's like everybody say a
[47:41] prayer. So you know I I said I'm I'm
[47:43] praying for him, right? So pray for him
[47:45] and all and and then uh you know that's
[47:48] that person we praying for that's in
[47:50] ICU. They responded back all is well.
[47:52] Amen.
[47:54] But by the end of the day that person
[47:56] was right back to normal before they
[47:59] even got out the hospital. I can't wait
[48:00] you got out the hospital this. And I
[48:02] said see it don't do no good for natural
[48:04] healing. Come on. Amen. If your soul is
[48:08] sick, right? Amen. Come on. Somebody say
[48:11] amen tonight. I know I ain't by myself.
[48:14] It don't do no good. Don't do it. I'd
[48:16] rather this body perish but my soul be
[48:19] saved. Hallelujah. Come on. And to be
[48:22] right with God. Reason why we can't see
[48:24] sometimes that the soul is sick. Right?
[48:28] That the church world is sick. They
[48:30] jump, they shout, they holler, all that.
[48:32] But when you look at it from God's eyes,
[48:34] they sick. Come on. How are they sick?
[48:37] Because they ain't in his presence.
[48:39] Hallelujah. It's a lot of emotion. Come
[48:42] on. But I don't know about you, but I
[48:43] want the presence. Why? The presence
[48:45] brings changes. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus.
[48:48] Come on. It does. The presence will
[48:50] bring a change. Come on. But what it is,
[48:53] God got to show you got to get so sick
[48:55] of yourself. Come on. You got to I'm not
[48:58] satisfied with myself. Come on. Amen.
[49:01] Amen. Come on. God, I need more of you.
[49:03] Hallelujah. Amen. And I'm under
[49:05] expectation for you to do more in my
[49:06] life. Amen. Hallelujah. And God will do
[49:09] it, won't he? But what it is, the
[49:11] people, like I said, is God got to open
[49:12] your eyes to that. And I thank God that
[49:14] that he does that. But it, like I said,
[49:16] is is is two types of sickness. Natural
[49:18] and spiritual, right? But I said, we we
[49:21] we concentrate so much on the natural
[49:23] man. But we'll find out one day that the
[49:26] spiritual man was the one that you
[49:28] needed, come on, to concentrate on
[49:30] because that part of you, Hallelujah,
[49:33] when it it would go back his body go
[49:34] back to the dust, that part of you is
[49:36] going somewhere. Hallelujah. But I says
[49:38] that you know I if God is is really and
[49:42] I I'm just saying it as a question but
[49:45] because there is a physician here. There
[49:47] is and don't let nobody tell you no
[49:49] different. There is a physician here.
[49:51] He's healing the natural body and the
[49:53] spiritual body. Come on. But sometimes
[49:56] people minds like I says they what
[49:59] what's going on? That's why you you you
[50:02] wonder just like Jeremiah here
[50:04] questioning. He said, "Is there no bomb
[50:06] in Gilly? If there's no physician here,
[50:08] then why is the health of my daughter
[50:10] not recovered?" Come on. Is there no God
[50:13] in 2025?
[50:15] Then why?
[50:17] Hallelujah. The people look like
[50:19] sometime they go backwards instead of
[50:21] forward. Why instead of coming to God,
[50:24] they go everywhere else? Hallelujah.
[50:26] Come on. I was talking with Moses the
[50:28] other day. I was having a nice little
[50:30] talk and I said, "You know, one thing I
[50:32] say
[50:33] is what's wrong with Jesus that people
[50:36] don't want
[50:37] him." Come on. They might not profess to
[50:40] you from the mouth they don't want him,
[50:42] but when they reject his word, they show
[50:43] you they don't want them because he is
[50:45] his word. Right? But I says we we we
[50:48] started taking examples out of the
[50:50] scriptures. And I say it's one thing,
[50:53] one thing uh Judas when he sold Jesus,
[50:57] you know, for the 20 or 30 pieces, he
[51:00] say Moses was saying, "Well, was that a
[51:02] lot of money?" Come on. I said, "It
[51:06] don't matter how much money it was. It
[51:08] could never meet up to the value of what
[51:10] Jesus gave." Come on. Hallelujah.
[51:14] But he he thought of it more valuable
[51:16] than Jesus. Come on. And we started
[51:18] talking about the value of Jesus. It's
[51:20] just me and Moses in the garage having a
[51:22] good old barn,
[51:24] right? But I says the value of Jesus,
[51:28] what was his
[51:29] value? I said Jesus value was
[51:32] hallelujah. He was healing the sick
[51:34] everywhere he
[51:35] went. Come on. Struggles and things that
[51:39] been on people for years, but now the
[51:42] healer is here. Hallelujah. Come on. You
[51:45] don't have to worry about it cuz you
[51:46] spent all your money at the doctor and
[51:48] he didn't do you no good. But we got
[51:50] someone that's greater than the doctor.
[51:52] Hallelujah. Come on. His value is way.
[51:55] Come on. His value was Hallelujah. Be
[51:58] thou healed according to your faith.
[52:00] Right? Come on. I said, "What was the
[52:02] value of Jesus when they was hungry?"
[52:05] Come on. He know how to He know how to
[52:07] create, didn't he? Give me the little
[52:09] bit that you got and I'll make sure it
[52:11] won't run out. Hallelujah. And you'll
[52:13] have extra to take up. His value was
[52:15] worth way more than the money. What
[52:17] could that money have done to him that
[52:19] Jesus couldn't have gave him?
[52:22] Think about that. We was talking about
[52:24] that. I said, "What? What could the
[52:25] money have done?" But you know what?
[52:27] That's what the Bible is saying. The
[52:29] love of money, it's not money, but the
[52:31] love of it is the root of all evil.
[52:33] Right? Come on. It was saying the other
[52:36] day bust up families, bust up homes,
[52:38] bust up churches, bust up. It's a
[52:40] destroyer everywhere it go. Right? Come
[52:42] on. But the love of it, right? When you
[52:45] love something, when you love something,
[52:46] it'll control you. Come on. Whether it's
[52:49] whether it's money, whether it's
[52:50] alcohol, drugs, whatever it might be,
[52:53] whatever you love, it's going to control
[52:55] you. Come on. It'll become your master.
[52:57] You believe that? Come on. And you say,
[52:59] "Oh, I ain't demand." But it becomes
[53:01] demanding. It's controlling, right? And
[53:03] you're going to be a servant to it. Come
[53:05] on. But I said, "God, I thank him that I
[53:08] once served sin, but God has made me
[53:10] free." Come on. And God not delivered
[53:12] me, then why should I be bound?
[53:13] Hallelujah. Come on. Serving in the
[53:16] liberty of God. Come on. I don't know
[53:19] about you, but I say yes. There is a
[53:21] physician here. That's the question. Is
[53:22] there Yes, there is a physician here.
[53:25] What are you dealing with? There is
[53:26] somebody that can help you out. Come on.
[53:29] I've been talking to people like, "Oh,
[53:30] you going through that? I got I know
[53:32] somebody that can help with that." And
[53:34] what his phone number is. Hallelujah.
[53:36] Come on. Acts 2:38. Come on. Bless. Come
[53:40] on. Hebrews 13:8. Amen. Come on. Matthew
[53:44] 28:19.
[53:46] Come on. I got we I I know somebody they
[53:48] say I know somebody who Yeah. Come on.
[53:50] They say, "Oh, you No, but what it is
[53:52] Jesus is He is the answer." Come on. He
[53:56] said, "For Abraham was, I am." Come on.
[53:59] He is.
[54:01] You can't lift nothing. You can't lift
[54:03] nothing higher than Jesus. Come on. You
[54:06] might try, but it can't go no higher. He
[54:09] is the standard. Hallelujah. Amen. Come
[54:11] on. And people will find that out one
[54:14] day that Jesus is a standard. Come on.
[54:16] And if they would only put their trust
[54:18] in and and depending on him, he would
[54:21] have took care of all their situations.
[54:23] I believe that. I I I'm living by that.
[54:25] Hallelujah. I'm living by that. God,
[54:27] that's true right now. Hallelujah. Come.
[54:30] Sometimes God got to take your eyes so
[54:31] he can lead you. Hallelujah. Cuz with
[54:33] your eyesight, you looking trying to
[54:35] navigate your own way. But when he takes
[54:37] it, sometimes he got to lead you. God
[54:39] leading. That's what I want. How many
[54:40] want that tonight? Somebody give the
[54:42] Lord a hand clap of praise.
[54:45] Amen. I said God God specialize it,
[54:48] don't he? Come on. Amen. He specialize
[54:51] it. I was saying the other day, you
[54:53] know, we was talking about wounds and
[54:55] scars. Sometime you can have a wound
[54:57] that leave a bad scar, right? Amen. And
[54:59] every time you see that scar, it reminds
[55:01] you of the trauma that happened, right?
[55:03] Amen. But I was think I was talking
[55:05] about non. I said it's amazing how he
[55:08] went down there and when God cleans them
[55:10] of leprosy like I says the skin was like
[55:13] new. Hallelujah. Come on. Wouldn't leave
[55:16] not even a scar. And that's what God
[55:17] does even spiritually speaking. Right.
[55:20] See God can heal the deep wounds. Amen.
[55:22] Come on. The deep wounds that nobody I'm
[55:24] saying there's a physician here tonight.
[55:26] God can handle the deep wounds that
[55:28] nobody don't know about. No. Nobody
[55:30] don't know what. No. Nobody don't. But
[55:32] Jesus does. Amen. Come on. That's the
[55:34] truth. We might not know what you going
[55:36] what you're dealing with, but Jesus
[55:38] knows. Come on. All about it. Amen. Come
[55:41] on. And he wants to help you. Come on.
[55:44] Amen. You You didn't know how free you
[55:46] could be. Yes, Lord. And it's already a
[55:49] finished work. It ain't nothing he got
[55:51] to come do. He already done it. Amen.
[55:53] Come on. Amen. You got to have faith not
[55:55] to believe it. Go to Calvary and know
[55:58] that it was for me. Hallelujah. That he
[56:00] died. That he shed his blood. I thank
[56:02] God that he did it for me. Hallelujah.
[56:04] Amen. Oh Jesus. The world don't want to
[56:07] accept it. But I say God, I want to
[56:09] accept what you did. Hallelujah. The
[56:11] church want to live below its
[56:12] privileges, but God, I want to live at
[56:14] my privileges. God, I want to ask, God,
[56:16] and receive from you because you said we
[56:18] can ask and receive. Hallelujah. And you
[56:21] said we have not because we do what? Ask
[56:23] not. Come on.
[56:26] But God, come on. He wants to do. That's
[56:28] why I thank God. I said, "Lord, you know
[56:30] us saying I said the Holy Ghost, he
[56:33] shows us things to come." Come on.
[56:35] That's what he He'll do that now. He'll
[56:38] show you things. He not He ain't just I
[56:40] got the Holy Ghost and I just feel jump
[56:41] shout. Come on. No. He's coming to teach
[56:43] you something. He's coming to reveal
[56:45] some stuff. He's coming to clean your
[56:47] life up. Come on. He's coming to change
[56:49] you from the inside out. Come on. That's
[56:52] what he's coming to do. That inner voice
[56:54] will speak to you. Hallelujah. You'll
[56:56] begin to see the word like you never saw
[56:58] it before because now you're not just
[57:00] reading it as a story or hearing it as
[57:02] intellectual. Come on. But it's
[57:05] something really speaking to you. And
[57:07] God is demonstrating it. Come on. He's
[57:09] showing himself alive and well by many
[57:11] infallible proofs. Hallelujah. Sometimes
[57:13] you can't tell people because they don't
[57:15] believe it. I say God do it for them.
[57:18] Hallelujah. God open their eyes and let
[57:20] them see. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on.
[57:23] Do you want to see tonight? Come on. I
[57:25] said, "We be alone tonight, but there's
[57:26] a physician here." Amen. Come on. There
[57:29] is. I said I said when the king of
[57:31] Samaria was going to the God of Acron,
[57:34] come on. That was an insult. He said,
[57:36] "Is there no God in Israel?" Cuz you
[57:39] wouldn't think so,
[57:41] right? Come on. I say, "Is there no God
[57:44] in Colombia?" Hallelujah. Come on. Is
[57:47] there no God in the in America today?
[57:50] Come on, Jesus.
[57:53] Maybe I know what he's in. He's in
[57:55] living in individual lives and hearts.
[57:57] Amen. He's in his word, but you got to
[58:00] open up your heart and let the word come
[58:01] in. Amen.
[58:03] [Music]
[58:04] [Applause]
[58:05] [Music]
[58:15] Praise God. Amen.
[58:18] We thank God for the great physician.
[58:20] Amen. Amen. Jesus Christ. Amen. The same
[58:23] yesterday, today, and forever. We
[58:26] appreciate the word tonight. We
[58:27] appreciate brother
[58:29] Ernest. Scripture says in Romans
[58:33] 6, it
[58:35] says, we thank God for sister Hannah.
[58:40] She wants to get baptized tonight. And
[58:42] we're going to just read a little bit
[58:45] of this scripture here. Romans 6 and1
[58:50] said, "What shall we say then? Shall we
[58:52] continue in sin that grace may abound?"
[58:55] said, "God forbid. How shall we that are
[58:59] dead to sin living along with
[59:01] therein? Know ye not that so many of us
[59:04] as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
