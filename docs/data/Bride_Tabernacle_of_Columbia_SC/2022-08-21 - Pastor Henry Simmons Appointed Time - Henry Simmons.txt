and full of trouble too does thou open thy eyes upon such a one and bring it to me into judgment with thee for seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot pass 6. for there is hope for tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again at and that the tender branches thereof will not cease eight yet through the scent water it will blood and bring forth brought like a plant tin and as the water failed from the sea and the floors decay and does dry up 12. oh that thou will hide me in the grave and that thou would keep me secret until thy wrath had be passed that thou would appoint me a set time and remember me 14. together thou shall call and i will answer thee thou will have the desire to work on thine hand may god bless you reading which word you may be seated i want to talk this morning about appointed time and full of sub-topic looking for my change i'm looking for my change appointed time there's a appointed time the book of her background having cue two her back or two and one habakkuk two and one it says i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the towel and i will watch to see what he would say unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved and the lord answered me and said write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that readed it for the vision is yet for a what appointed time uh so this morning i want to talk about an appointed time praise god an appointed time sometimes amen we're impatient but god has an appointed time he has an appointed time amen and a lot of times we get our time mixed up with god's time but god has an appointed time the prophet of god was bringing out that that that joshua and caleb that come to a point in our promising land is coming to sight amen but god had a appointed time for joshua and caleb to cross over into that promised land you know after god had commissioned them amen joshua to take over after moses died and joshua was to take the people over into the promised land it was in sight but god had appointed time when they were to march through the jordan god had that time appointed but nevertheless you know uh oftentimes as god's servants say god prophecy and oftentimes we get in the way we get impatient but job said all the days of my appointed time i'm going to wait i'm going to wait till my chains come it's something about patiently waiting amen sometimes we we get so impatient that we cannot wait on god amen to do what he said he'll do we get in a hurry but god has an appointed you know i i i i i'm more as i was in prayer i said lord uh i indeed i i i recognize that i gotta have more patience sometimes we impatient with one another sometimes we're impatient with situations and conditions and sometimes we just get tired of waiting and and no doubt it was 40 years that the children of israel was supposed to go over into the promised land but they had not arrived as yet and oftentimes amen they must have got a little weary in the journey and then they told joshua one time let us go up and possess the land but it wasn't god timing at that time so sometimes we we we want to hurry he meant mama we want to hurry daddy wanna hurry lose it on the job we want to they may we want it now amen it may be things and situations in life that god said be patient amen you must be patient your change is coming but you got to be patient amen it's coming but you got to wait on it amen sometimes we want to make it happen they meant sometimes we want to do something to hurry it up i'm tired of weak you know sometimes when we try to hurry it up and try to make something happen it don't happen the way we expect amen see you can't expect god to move on your timing amen god got his own timing amen but we want god to work on our time and god if you don't do it by such and such a time then i'm gonna take it and do it on my time amen god if you don't give me a raise about x amount of uh time i'm gonna find me a new job maybe god wants you to stay there a little while longer and be patient god if you don't promote me amen i'm gonna find the promotion elsewhere god if you don't bless me i'm gon oh lord i'm gonna do something see sometimes with situations and conditions and things in our lives are not working amen as we will but god works all things out to the council of his own will amen god has a time upon appointed amen just like he had a time appointed of the father he knew when he was going to bring the children of israel out of egypt he meant because god had a set time and appointed time that he was going to come down amen but he was waiting on something see god couldn't do it to moses was born so god waited till moses was born because that was the vessel that god full knew in his mind before the foundation of the world amen so when moses was born amen god was ready amen and when moses amen slew the egyptian moses was ready god was ready but the people weren't ready amen see sometimes god is ready amen god's servant was ready moses was ready but the people wasn't ready so god had to delay and let moses go on the backside of the desert for 40 years amen so what happens sometimes god is ready amen but we are not ready for god to move in our lives we're not ready for god to bless us we're not ready to handle god's blessing right then oh god so what happens it meant moses was delayed for a while and then god amen amen the people had got enough of each of it they cried out because the frictions had gotten tougher and harder and then they cried out to god and god moses at 80 years old he was going down to do the job that god had ordained for him amen at some time that was god's timing amen and and when adam and eve had sinned the bible said the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent amen and god had to wait now isaiah said a virgin shall concede it looked like it happened amen thousands of years later he meant that god sent amen the seed of the woman amen a virgin conceiving amen it took years but mary had to be born amen if god had a certain vessel a certain young lady that he was going to use and her name was mary and when mary arrived god knew it was the season it was the time and god sent john the baptist on the scene all at that season because he had somebody to prepare the way of the lord and god had mary and elizabeth on the scene amen because god had chosen those vessels for that appointed time praise god if god always have a aim at a certain time for mordecai and esther god had appointed time amen esther amen had come for season such as this amen when uh the jews were under heavy persecution amen and esther and monaco said how did you know esther that god did not choose you for such a time as this it was an appointed time that god amen was going to use esther and praise god so god had a esther on the scene folks saw amen this uh a change was coming amen uh for those that were looking for jesus amen for elephants tells us amen in philippians 3 and 20 amen praise god philippians 3 and 20 it says for our conversation is where our conversation is in heaven see amen praise god it was something uh uh about uh amen those that were he said in the 18th verse he says for many in the for in 18 verses many walk of whom i've told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are enemies of the white of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is their shame who mind what who mind earthly things but he says but uh for our conversation is in heaven amen from whence we look for the savior the lord jesus christ so uh here amen paul was amen amen he said the promised land the prophet said the promised land was in sight and your our promised land is in sight now amen we you know as much as they have come to the break amen a georgian and they can look over and see the promised land brother and sister amen god's appointed time that our promised land is in sight amen i said the rapture is in view it and it's come in plain view amen amen what are you talking about i'm talking about the lord has descended in a shower amen and our promised land is in sight amen we're looking at something amen oh god amen if you don't see it then something is wrong amen praise god we see the days of noah we see the days of lot amen but we see the day of the son of man oh yes our promised land is in sight praise god hallelujah you know i believe that noah was building an ark amen because he knew that destruction was in sight amen he knew he meant that what god had promised so he was building that ark and through seven church ages god amen was a building amen a house and habitation of god a church amen upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against him god was building amen from faith amen come in hold up amen the virgin knowledge temperance coming on up to the capstone time they meant we're building a house a spiritual house amen amen i all came and weigh in he can indwell amen no amen perhaps he didn't know amen amen that the day not the hour but noah kept building because amen destruction was invigoral the world was in a terrible condition man had gone so far away from god that every imagination and thought of me and heart was continually evil amen but noah had a revelation amen that i'm gonna build this up came in because god is gonna save me yeah god god had a plan praise god for appointed time for a time such as no day god had a secret that was revealed to his servant the prophet amen i'm so glad that god reveals his secret to serving the prophet god will not hide from abraham that which he's getting ready to do when god was getting ready to destroy sodom god said shall i hide from abraham the thing i'm getting ready to do amen there was a pointed time that god amen was to get tired of all amen the sin and all of the filth that's going on in the world god was gonna get tired god had an appointed time praise god nobody knew what time it was but i believe that god revealed to know this is the end time amen this is the season that i'm gonna do something in the body i believe we've reached again to a time appointed that god's gonna do something about the wickedness that's in the world i believe god is gonna do something about amen men ignoring amen god and thinking god amen doesn't matter amen holiness is not oh hallelujah holiness is right praise god god is going to do something about it brother and sister there is an appointed time he said here he says this time you and i our expectation is not to go over to a natural land but here paul begin to view he says our conversation is in heaven for which also we look for our savior the lord jesus christ who shall what amen i'm looking for my change what about you i'm looking for my change you should change our what you might not think your body is vile but he says paul says i will vowel bodies praise god we might look at our bodies as beautiful as you know young and youthful or whatever but he said who should change our vowel bodies this is a corrupt body this is a sinful body to get came forth by sin but god's going to change our vowel bodies this corruption must put on incorruption for we shall be changed in the moment of the twinkling of an eye are you look man for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality we shall be changed brother and sister he said who should change our vile bodies and fashion it like unto his what glory his body according to the working world by he is what he's able to what to subdue all things i said god is able to subdue all things and i i i i i want to uh because i got many things to say but i i it's going to be hopefully short and sweet this morning so i'm coming i i'm coming home in a minute so by the grace of god as i come home i want you to think about this to curse you is to bless you on as as i come to the closing remarks to curse you is to bless you or you will be so what are you saying to me i'm saying amen that there's a pointed time for you to go through what you're going through there's a point of time that you may not understand what you're going through while you're going through it but at the point of time job said i'm going through some things i may not understand it clearly but i know amen one day i'll call and he answered amen he said all the days of my appointed time i'm waiting wait why because i know my change is going to come job said another day i know my redeemer see he was looking for redemption what i'm going through i know my redeemer live praise god it's something about knowing what you know it meant that you're in the hands of god as caleb said the other night amen all things gonna work together to the good to know what you know amen it causes you to hope it causes you to wait it's causing you to be patient because you know what to know praise god so if we know what we know normals i'm saying numbers 24 to curse you is to bless you amen sometimes we don't want to be cursed but sometimes your blessing is hidden within that curse amen so much so oftentimes people trying to stop your amen and trying to hinder you but they blessing you and sometimes amen you might look at it as a a a as a curse you might look at it as an obstacle in your way you might look at it as an enemy amen sometimes your enemy amen is for you because he said if god before you who can be against you are you up man so sometimes we look caleb you got a mic just read this one uh uh um 24 and um 1 24 and and one and um numbers 24 and one on on down okay sometimes to curse you is to bless you are you with me sometimes we looking at it from all i'm telling you i'm guilty i'm looking at it from a different perspective i'm looking at it as uh my enemies why i'm going through what i'm going through sometimes we're looking at life as has many twists and turns and it's many disappointments and and sometimes amen we look at our life as being unfair sometimes we look at why did this happen to happen why did this have to happen why did i have to be the victim why did i have to go through what i'm going through why amen others look like they're blessed and i'm cursed all kinds of things but god has an appointed time there is an appointed time that the curse event turns around and the curse turns around and in the curse it's a blessing amen your enemies become your blessing praise god amen and that's what happens sometimes i want you to see the picture because sometimes we amen we ain't got patient enough to wait and see what the end gonna be sometimes we don't let god finish what he's doing sometimes we getting messed up amen god plan amen and what god is doing sometimes we jump in the middle of it amen as caleb said the other night we jump in the middle of it amen and don't allow god to do what he's doing because you're going to take and you're going to be the big bad one or you would be you're going to take matters in your own hand and sometimes that's not the way god wants you to handle it amen he said vengeance is mine i will go ahead numbers 24-1 and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his faith toward the wilderness and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him and he took up his his parable and said balaam the son of baor has said and the man whose eyes are open has said he has said which heard the words of god which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open how god how goodly are thy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel as the valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the riverside as the trees of line of lion aloes whose the lord hath planted and that cedar trees beside the waters he shall pour the water out of his buckets in a seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than a gag and his kingdom shall be exalted god brought him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of in unicorn he shall eat of the nations his enemies and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows he coached he couched he laid down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him blessed is he that blessed thee and curse it is he that curses thee and they like anger was kindled against balaam and he smoked his hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse my enemies and behold thou has altogether blessed them these three times see what we miss is amen when the devil curse you or when your enemies are crushing you he they're actually blessing you but you you look at it and said they trying to stop me they're trying to hinder me but actually they are blessing you are you a man so i want you to get it because uh a lot of times we have all kind of complex and accusing and acquisitions against everybody amen doing me wrong this was knowing me wrong that one did this no somebody did this and some i know don't worry about those things because amen there's a blessing in the curse are you with me so sometimes we get out of god's perfect plan and provision uh for our lives amen yo sometimes i i go to all these scriptures but i gotta go as i feel led this morning first corinthians two first corinthians two uh so there's a blessing in the curse i got excited because i wanted to take time out to let you know because a lot of times we run from our blessing we actually run for from our blessing we try to get in the way of what god is doing in our lives and we i'ma tell you something amen you're gonna have to come right back to where god where you started it right back from what you're running from god gonna bring it right back to you amen because you cannot run from the plan and the mission of god amen what god got for you you got to do it god had appointed jonah to go to nineveh it doesn't matter what jonah tried to do amen jonah had to do what god said are you with me if god had ordained you for a certain purpose and for a certain reason you got to settle down and be patient and said i'ma wait until my change come i'm looking for my change lord amen god chose you for a certain purpose now look what happened amen uh baal them what they cursed but what the cursing there was a blessing amen he got you know i'm paying you amen bill uh bail them and be like saying what what what what what in the world are you doing i pay i'm paying you to catch those people and you turn around you bless them oh lord look 2 and uh and 7. he says first corinthians 2 and 7 it says but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which uh god for god ordained before the world unto his glory god got it all controlled before the world was you know job said your steps are determined your bounds that you cannot pass in job 14. don't you know god knows every step you're going to make he knows your failures he knows your success he knows your thoughts the numbers of your hair is counted god knows all about everything so here amen god knew the mistakes that you would make in life he knows that the situation says who's going to do you wrong why they done you wrong and god know the whole story don't try to tell god you don't know my story god do know your story and god why don't you let it happen to me amen praise god god god amen in the midst of whatever happened god's gonna make it work to your good god gonna bless you in the curse hallelujah don't don't make try to make folk feel sorry for you amen you ought to say thank you god because something you took me to for a reason lord you let such and such a happen for a reason praise god it could have been worse amen but you let me experience something and i'm going to turn around amen and god is going to walk to my good if this wouldn't happen i wouldn't be serving you if this wouldn't have happened i wouldn't thank you amen i might have not considered you lord but lord because it came my way i want to say thank you lord because i realize that i need you lord i realize no matter what god you were there for me praise god no matter what i went to you still love me praise god i don't know why and amen we'll understand it better by and by when the morning come amen praise god god one day amen it's called and how you adjust to the situation it causes how you look at amen praise god your curse praise god hallelujah sometimes we're looking at it from uh uh a pity party perspective instead of looking at it from uh uh a blessing perspective amen but perhaps jesus said why why jesus said if it be possible let this cup pass man that that had done no wrong to have power to call 12 legion angels yet they spit on him yet they call him the prince of devils yet they didn't like him all he did was good that's all he did amen no man has suffered like jesus suffered and had the kind of power that he had but yet he went through and loved uh a wretched like you and i to die now look he says and this is what i want to ask you here the wisdom of god and the mystery even the hidden words and with god ordained before the world and to his glory which none of the what let me tell you the devil the bible said they did it in the green tree they do it in the draw he said the world don't know you and neither did the world know him are you with me the world the devil don't know who you are the devil told him if you be see he was thinking that he might have was but i don't know for certain she said if you be the son of god praise god but jesus knew what that's right and see you got to know who you are the devil will question amen and have you to doubt who you are amen but you got to know who you are whose i am paul said in whom i said i got to know who my whose i am i got to know that i'm a son of god i got to know you got to know your daughter of god you got to know that god is your father you got to know amen your sons and daughters of god you got to know the devil don't quite know it that's why the bible said none of the princes of this world knew had they known it they what they would not have crucified the what see what i'm saying see they wouldn't have killed them if they would have known amen they would not have crucified the lord of glory because in his death praise god when they tried to cast him they meant it was a blessing amen why because god had a hidden plan oh god god has a hidden plan for all you've been through glory to god all you going through amen praise god there's a diamond in the roof amen god got a plan oh hallelujah god you're working some out for me hallelujah yes i've been through the strain i've been through the stone with god working some house hallelujah praise god hallelujah i i i i said that's a blessing uh uh the none of the princes of the world knew but about i want to ask you the question but do you know they didn't know if they'd have known they were to persecute you i said there's a blessing in the curse remember what what's what what you're going through what the devil trying to take you through there's a blessing in it praise god hallelujah if they would only knew praise god that's why jesus said forgive them are you with me that's why stephen knew that they might lay this knot at their child though they stole me ain't that god forgive them because amen i don't want you to lay that in charge are you with me see sometimes we got to understand that there's a blessing in the curse amen praise god so he so i got to go a little farther uh matthew 5 matthew 5 because sometimes we mistaken we we bypass our blessing because we look at what we see because the things that are seen are temporal sometimes we overlook the blessings amen in our suffering the bible said the captain of our salvation made perfect through the things that he suffered and sometimes we don't want to suffer but the bible said eyes have not seen it have not heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things that god has prepared for them amen hey hallelujah i'm looking for my chains amen all the days of my appointed time i'm gonna wait till my change come because i got a pointed time for things to turn around amen whipping man do it for night but joy coming in the morning praise god hallelujah praise god when the night is gone and the sun is shining thank god hallelujah oh god so matthew here amen 5 and 10 it says blessed are they which are what sometimes i wonder do you know where your blessing's coming from praise god i i think as long as everything's going good we can sing thank god you know your joy amen but you will your joy coming from because amen you get joy for what he done for me i get joy when i think about amen see god has done something he doesn't bought you through something that's what you're shouting about that's why you're happy amen that's what i'm encouraged about amen say here he says blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the what you see what i'm saying i said your promised land is in sight and i want you to see where your blessings are coming from he says blessed are ye when men shall what revile you and what the persecute you and shall what falsely for what amen what what it says read what rejoice and what i wonder how many of us do that i wonder how many of us really really really rejoice you know some of the saddest people in the in the world is the church folk because they say look what someone said no none this song had done that everybody done something and the devil had us with our head hung down but he said rejoice and be what that's when you're going through something you ought to be happy amen but you can't be happy because you don't know the bible said had he known the princes of the word no they would not have crucified him if balaam they like would have known that in cursing israel he was going to bless them he wouldn't have never sent paid all his money and sent bail him down because are you a man but you got to understand that there's a blessing in the curse amen that god is blessing you from what you've been through going through that i don't know how amen god pull out blessings that you won't have room enough to receive god is blessing you with abundance amen the more you amen absorb the persecution look what job god restored all the job ever went through god gave him everything back amen hallelujah so what i'm saying the enemy amen may try to hold you down but he can't do it he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad amen for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets would work before you okay our last verse i said i was gonna be shocked but it looked like i went wrong 50 genesis 50. praise god i swear to preach it but i i slowed down on purpose because i really want you to to absolve it because if you don't absolve it and really see it amen sometimes you'll go back and you'll make the same mistakes over and over and over you'll maybe some situation is waiting on the job some situation is waiting in the home some situation is gonna it's gonna happen this week but you got to realize that there's a blessing when they try to curse you that god got a blessing in that are you with me praise god and whatever you've been through amen it might have been holding you down for years it might have been holding you down for quite a long spell in your life but realizing that now is the appointed time god has a set time an appointed time to bring the children out and god got a set time and appointed time to even bring us out also god has a set time amen joseph was separated from his brothers for a long time amen praise god not because joseph wanted to be separated joseph was separated because his brothers had a plan they had a jealous spirit against him and because they had a jealous spirit against him the in 50 and 17. you all know the story of joseph how he was soldier in the egypt he said so so shall ye say unto joseph jacob telling them what they need to say to joseph forgive i pray thee now the trespasses of your brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil see they did evil you see what i'm saying you know you think those brothers knew amen they just was overcome with the spirit and and they didn't they didn't mean it i mean at that particular time they were caught you know sometimes peter said i go on deny you i won't deny you why because amen and jesus said get behind me satan saul consented to stephen's death he was right there do you know god didn't hold him didn't lay that to his charge are you with me so i'm saying why what what god planned for saul's life amen he went through certain things but god had a plan it did not interrupt god's plan for his life god was going to turn things around amen and the one that saw was persecuting saul was going to turn around and be a blessing to those people that he looked like he hated god was going to turn around praise god so brother and sister look he says his father joseph and joseph wept when they speak unto him in 18 verses and his brothers also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants and joseph said unto them fear not i am if i am i in this place i'm i'm in this i'm in the place of god am i am i in the place of god but as for you ye thought what you thought evil against me but what you see what i'm saying we make we make major mistakes in life praise god you see joseph had to come to a conclusion that i wouldn't be where i am had not you done what you done see what i'm saying sometimes i will mistakes and i will the things that we do when we make mistakes and we make bad decisions i make them all of us do and sometimes we we think that somebody's done us wrong and and sometimes we cry i'm guilty we all are guilty sometimes so um but we don't understand that god's purpose and plan for our lives amen god will make things a curse and be a blessing are you look man so he says as you meant it for evil god meant it for good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people's lives are you with me see god wanted to save a lot of lives and that's this is the way he did it so you know you don't say all things work together and so what i'm saying to you i hope that you see the blessing and that you ought to be happy amen instead of holding the devil hold something over your head he hold it down hold it there all right and and then god is saying let it go because behind him and letting it go amen you'll see the blessing in it praise god you'll see the blessing amen praise god hallelujah somebody went through the same thing you went through amen and they didn't make it are you with me somebody went through what you were going through and they did not make it praise god their response and their

thank god this morning remember i'm speaking to somebody amen i i got so happy until i wanted to preach i wanted to preach but i i realized that i i said i gotta let this sink in because whatever whatever the devil meant for evil amen and the devil tried to curse and why he's trying to curse it's a blessing but you don't see it as a blessing that's why you amen don't wait that's why you're
