with us so we continue on with the series amen last night we were ministering a little in that area and I've said if I had somebody to replace me this morning I let somebody else because I was just drained so I said I've been going and going and going it's time for if you pass 35 the second time to take a little break amen so by the grace of God Romans 8 and 27 and he that searches the heart knows what the mind of the spirit because he make his intercessions for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that what all things work together for the what for the good of them that what love God to them who are the what a call according to his purpose for whom he did what for no God knew you you foreknew you look at somebody say God foreknew you he knows you amen for new he also did what predestinate to be conformed unto the image of his son we said on last night we lost image and we lost his likeness non-god is conforming us back to this image and to his likeness okay that he might be the firstborn among many brethren Mo whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified then he also glorified what should we say these what shall we then say to these things if what then what God bless the reasons words you may be seated if God be for us amen y'all had to pray for me if I got enough strength I just talked to y'all this morning about the grace of God if God be for us then who can be against it you know sometimes the realization of God being with us that God befalls God be with us getting an extra question if God be with us we've heard about what God did for our fathers but if God be with us then we'll be all the Miracles that our fathers told us of I'm saying brother and sister Amen in this age that we're living in then you have a promise for the age and then your promise for the age that you're living in then you must look for the manifestation in the Vindication of the promise what God promised you in this hour that we're living in then you need to be looking forward he told them when Jesus rose from the dead he said carry you in the city of Jerusalem and wait there until you're being due with power from on high praise God they waited there amen under expectation we must be waiting on the expectation looking for God to fulfill what he said praise God and then when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were always one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sign from Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were setting and they appeared unto them clothes and tongues locked out the fire in a shot upon each of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with tongues and they heard them speak in their own language they were Jews about men out of every nation they met there were medes and Pastor lights and elamites and dwellers in Mesopotamian Cappadocia opponents and phrase and plant philia it was from all over amen they came together they heard them speak in their own language amen and then somebody said amen because they were starting and they looked like they were drunk but they heard them speak in their own language and they said not all these that speak Godly and how here we have a man in our own language there's something about the way they spoke they met because they knew that they didn't understand amen our language but yet we can hear them speak in our own language they knew that it was a great happening and there was a miracle in their mission but they could not understand the fullness of what was going on and they said they must be full of new wine but Peter's standing up with 11 said these men are not drunk as ye supposed a sin it is but the third hour of the day but he said this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel that in the last days said God that I apart my spirit upon All Flesh they had a promise amen and God Amen was fulfilling his promised word and I said we have a promise amen the Bible said in the evening time there shall be light and I believe we're in the evening time the Bible tells us amen at midnight amen There Were Ten virgins and five were wives and five were foolish but at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom coming to go yeah to meet him amen praise God you've got to have all In Your Vessel with your Lambs you've got to have the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost if God be false that who can be against us praise God I thank God Hallelujah as I look at Romans here he said who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect I know that God Amen has an elect people that he fore knew that he predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son you need to be looking forward Amen to God conforming you to the image of his son as they want the expectation for the Holy Ghost you are in expectation for image and likeness of God that you and God become one you are looking forward to Capstone headstone Ministry amen that the head comes to connect with the body the body being the church you've been the body Christ being the head of the church amen the Capstone amen come into amen back to the body amen headship

you find yourself it's the quicker you find out who you are that you you can actually amen become matured in that area but you got to find your position in your place even for this life once you find

y'all you know usually I don't do this amen but by the grace of God maybe God is just moving me in that direction are you with me that you can just you know understand you got to find out as as quick as you can find out the area in life that God is going to bless you it's not about you know I can do this well I can do that well find out your career pattern what you're going to be good at and that you're going to enjoy are you with me and when you find out what you're going to be good at and you enjoy then start taking advantage of it as young as you are when you begin Young then but if you don't know where you're going somebody's gonna point you in their Rexes but if when you got a certain guidance and a certain angle a place where you want to be then those that want to compel you and push you in that direction then you but if they want to push in another Direction no you know where you're at and you ask God God show me show me Lord because I need to start working on not only my spiritual life but what you want me to do to get by in this corner light Lord I need direction I need guidance from you and Lord I want you to direct my path are you with me I want you to show me amen what I'm to be and what I'm going to do that I can get along in this life and that I can have eternal life but he says seek you up first the kingdom of God and then he said what all other things would be are you with me so I'm just talking to you simple amen just talking to your plane amen I want you to you know really take advantage amen of God's opportunity to you and your life take advantage of it amen don't let it pass I know mama daddy and Grandma and everybody that told you but amen I just amen reinforcing that are you with me that you take advantage of things even that's available to you now because one day you're gonna wish you would have to take advantage of it and you were so busy trying to be grown [Music] trying to be grown that you couldn't even enjoy your youth amen couldn't enjoy too busy trying to be cute I don't know who told you you was pretty gonna blow your head up are you with me somebody should have told you were ugly then you wouldn't want nobody to see you you know what I'm saying but people oh you look so good oh Lord nothing blow your head up and you really something are you with me man you really cool dude hey they could have told you you was a flunky are you with me you see sometimes you don't need that look extra you already got enough already you don't need no help are you up man sometimes before you give them a little help man you got something on your hand in there right so I'm talking he said why are you talking I'm talking to these young people because I don't know why I'm talking to him he said you spend a lot of time with your young people why God love young people I know I'm too old for them to listen to me but I still try are you with me so I said you do all day listen to you I said yeah well I'm still talking to him because I still care about him because I still love them amen I still want to try to help them the best I can ain't that right they say your grandpa great grand pop you can't tell us nothing no well I'm trying amen but one day and mama said you wish you would have listened are you with me you wish you would have listened to Grandma Mom you wish you would have listened to Grandpa you wish you would have listened but I'm just saying somebody listen now God is good okay take your five minutes and close them I said didn't turn me off said Karen get through your time up thank you Lord have mercy God is good amen may we thank the Lord for the service this morning and thank the Lord for what he spoke this morning and really just understanding that that he really cares and that he really is trying to tell you the truth many of the lessons that he tells you this morning he told me he tells me every day I go back and I ask him ask him how to do certain things because people before you they have wisdom because they've experienced it they've been through it they don't understood what you trying to go through and what you're trying to do they've already been through it or they've seen someone that went through it and they've seen the end of it they see where it ends up and now you look back and they can tell you about it before you get there so you don't have to go that way you don't have to go down those Pathways and those roads and figure out where it's going to end up because they can tell you about it so sometimes you got to open your ears and just listen there's some advice that I didn't believe was true but I listened I didn't find out till years later and had the experience that what he said was true and sometimes you may not see it in the immediate but you should listen now so you don't have to go through it you don't have to experience it because they're telling you the truth they only tell you that because they care about you they only tell you that is because they want to see the best thing for you but you looking around and say I'm gonna listen to my friends your friends don't know much they haven't lived long enough to experience enough to know what they're talking about so you listen to people that's older than you you listen to your parents you might not you might look at them and say well they ain't got everything together that's okay they still working and God's still working on them God's still developing them and all you got to do is pray for them that God will lead them so that they can lead you you don't know what they may be going through and everything that life is brought forth to them but you listen to them and say Lord God you lead them so that they can lead me see there's things that you should listen to you should go back and you should ask questions because you don't know everything even though you may look up on the Internet Because the Internet is available now and you can look up things that still ain't gonna give you everything that you want to know that's still not going to give you the real life experience that someone can tell you because they've done seen it they don't experience it and they can come back and tell you see that's why we go back and we ask those that are above us we go talk to people we ask them we say what do you think about this how can you how should I go about this because they have that wisdom and God has given it to them God has allowed you to be around people that can give you sound advice God has allowed you to be around people and bless you with people that have things and care about you enough to tell you there's some people that don't have that in their life they don't have no one around you to tell you they don't have no one around you to say hey don't do this this is where you're gonna end up you're gonna end up in jail you're gonna end up in prison you're gonna end up dead but you if you keep going the way that you're going but there's people around you that care about you and say don't go that way don't hang around those people you said they're my friends I grew up with those people but those people got to pass but that might not be your path that might not be where you headed this morning but you got to make your own decision because at the end of the day nobody can make that choice for you nobody can make the choice of what you want to do with your life but we can tell you that if you choose Jesus it's the best thing for you I can tell you from my own experience that if you choose the Lord he'll always watch out for you he'll always lead you in the right path in the right direction he'll always make sure that he'll supply all your needs even when you're down and out and you're struggling with things he'll still be there and say I'm watching over you I'm keeping you I'm making sure that every path is straight before you I'm making sure that you walk through the right doors make sure you're around the right people even when you're going through you say Lord I know that you can keep me because I gave my life to you I know that you're the god that's able to keep me more than I can keep myself and you may not understand why you go through certain things but sometimes God said I'm proving to you that I can keep you I'm proving to you that I can help you I'm proving to you that God is the god that can do everything that you want him to do for you and he'll Lead You In the right path amen amen at this time we asked everyone a dead stand this morning me and let us bow Lord Jesus Lord we heard the sermon that you spoke this morning Lord we heard that you said that if you be for us who can be against us Lord Lord we want to come this morning and say Lord thank you for you being forced Lord thank you for you giving us the opportunity to say Lord we can choose you we can give our lives to you Lord and we can say Lord we want you to be for us Lord that nothing can stand against us Lord we want you to go before us and lead us and guide us and Lord we ask that you come down today Lord I want to ask the ones that are here how many you want him to be for you just lift your hands if you want them to before you and if you wanted to before you just lift your hand say Lord I want you to be for me this morning Lord I want you to lead and guide me Lord I want you to direct me Lord I lift my hands as well Lord we want you this morning Lord we want you to lead us this morning Lord we want you to guide us this morning Lord take us and move us and from this day on that we may say Lord you are the head of Our Lives

us go forward and know that you're the only and the one and true God in Jesus name we pray amen at this time where we'll sing a song and then we ask for the Josh to dismiss us amen [Music] [Music] Lord if you leave [Music] Lord let me walk [Music] be there [Music] oh Lord oh Lord [Music] me [Music] if you leave [Music] [Music] me before I want you foreign [Music] I'll tell you what I you know I'm glad that the pastor just talked to the young people today I tell you my heart really pours out for him because they go through so many things and the devil has so many traps that set out there for the young people I remember just working in prison and hearing some of the stories of some of the young people and and young people it's sad to see a inmate with you know that that's 22 years old or that's 23 years old and got 40 Years or or you know they 25 years old and got 35 years and and you can really see the depression on their face when they serving so many years and then and I've known inmates in the prison system that that took their own lives because the depression of it you know it's sad because you know the devil try to set these traps and in the end they find out that they don't have no friends in the end you know they family they gave up on them and and you could just see the depression looked on their face but I'm here to tell you that God God got a plan for your life as well you don't have to fall into the devil trap you don't have to do what the devil says you don't have to go on that path that the devil is trying to push you on to that God can deliver you God can redeem you God can set you on a path of righteousness amen amen let us bow ahead Lord God we thank you so much for your word being poured out upon us Lord God and just get deep down within our soul lord let your anointing just fall in our hearts Lord God the Lord we not only be doers of the word Lord or Heroes of the world rather but we'll be doers as well Lord God just touch every young person that is here Lord touch everyone that he said but Lord God our young people Lord they need you more Lord Lord God they need you right now Lord God because this the devil he has so many traps set for them Lord God just touch everyone that is here Lord just uplift them Lord God give them Faith Lord strengthen their faith right now Lord God that they'll have a faith that Is Anchored In You Lord just continue to bless us Lord God continue to strengthen us as a congregation Lord give us traveling grace and travel and mercy that as we get back and forth to our destination that you will be with us on continue to use us continue to bless us continue to keep Us in Jesus Christ name we pray amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]
