[41:43] that
[41:44] thou therefore endure hardness as a good
[41:46] soldier of Jesus Christ and no man that
[41:49] wolf entangled himself with their fears

[41:57] last one Hebrews 11. Hebrews with heaven
[42:01] praise God he was 11 verse 5 and 6.
[42:04] and we know Enoch is our typing man he
[42:06] was the seventh of Adam and Eva and
[42:07] Enoch is the type of the Bride end time
[42:09] bride so it says by faith me not was
[42:11] translated that he should not see death
[42:13] and was not found because God had
[42:15] translated him for before this testimony
[42:17] for for his translation he had this
[42:19] testimony that he pleased God but
[42:22] without faith was impossible to please
[42:23] him he that cometh to God must believe
[42:25] that he is and his rewardeth him that

[42:30] worried to maybe see United man amen

[42:53] and elections sure amen let's know we
[42:55] are we are we must know that we have
[42:57] come into a place and coming to a time
[42:59] where this is our seasoning man you must
[43:02] come into the place of Our Lives we must
[43:03] swear we ought to manifested word for
[43:05] the day man and realize it and through
[43:07] all the midst of his trials and
[43:08] tribulations uh what we're going through
[43:10] man we know God gonna make everything
[43:12] work out for our good amen see a True
[43:14] Believer no they don't care what come up
[43:16] go God go work it out for me man see if
[43:18] you if we ain't guessing we ain't hoping
[43:21] I said I ain't guessing about God I
[43:23] ain't hoping I know God Amen and you
[43:25] know God but Revelation and Revelation
[43:27] has been revealed personally to you amen
[43:30] so he told Peter say Upon This Rock I'll
[43:32] build my church and the gates of hell
[43:33] should not Prevail against what the
[43:35] revelation God not you not but to
[43:37] remember your pastor can't give you the
[43:39] Revelation Revelation come from God Amen
[43:41] but the word your pastor preached can
[43:44] get can take you to that revelation
[43:48] we're not here to get you to a church
[43:50] we're here to get you to God Amen and
[43:52] once you meet Christ you will never be
[43:54] the same again amen the main thing with
[43:55] the main purpose we want to meet Christ
[43:57] amen and Christ is the word amen
[44:00] so in his time of living they know you
[44:02] know we see we see so many things uh you
[44:04] see it's so much turmer than land we see
[44:06] so many so many uh so many people uh are
[44:09] following me but the Bible say we're
[44:10] having all the words must be fulfilled
[44:13] somebody gotta make the word live
[44:15] but I'm looking how many I'm Gonna Make
[44:16] the World say I'm gonna take a Rapture
[44:18] man see I I I I I I would say I didn't
[44:21] come this far to turn around
[44:23] Jesus said hey I believe he didn't bring
[44:25] me this far to lose me man because a
[44:27] child of God cannot be lost amen because
[44:30] we were like before you even stepped on
[44:31] this Earth before you before you even
[44:33] came uh it may flesh you was a thought
[44:36] in God's mind
[44:38] and before there was a day before there
[44:40] was a star before there was a world God
[44:43] said but the Bible says he put your name
[44:45] on the lands book a life amen before the
[44:48] foundation of the world Amen so because
[44:50] someone so when God does something he
[44:52] does something perfect amen God don't
[44:54] remember God Don't Make No mistake amen
[44:56] see he called you before he before me
[44:59] when God called you he knew he would
[45:01] have he knew you could make mistakes
[45:03] he knew you would have faults and
[45:05] failures but but he didn't call your
[45:07] face he called the gene a Godly Man see
[45:10] God the word don't come quick remember
[45:11] the Bible says data in the flesh cannot
[45:14] please God
[45:15] you walk in the flesh you'll never
[45:17] please God
[45:18] because your flesh is an enemy against
[45:20] Gods that's why you got to be born again
[45:23] and once you're born again you become a
[45:25] new creature and Christ say man good
[45:27] morning you know more you know more the
[45:29] old person now you're a new creature in
[45:30] Christ same man but you got to meet God
[45:33] first amen it amazes me how people can
[45:36] come in the message
[45:37] can say they believe the word ain't even
[45:39] born again huh
[45:42] because you ain't careful
[45:44] you can hear you can hear quotes
[45:47] you get quote you remember you can quote
[45:49] the Bible
[45:50] and still don't know God
[45:52] because if I say the letter killer but
[45:56] in spirit giving life a man describe the
[45:58] Pharisees knew the Bible backward and
[46:00] forwards but when they met their word
[46:02] they caught a bad word they said they
[46:03] believe they call them but yells above
[46:05] because they had an intellectual Faith
[46:07] they had an intellect intellectual
[46:08] knowledge about God they knew it by
[46:10] memorization
[46:11] we don't serve God but remember we serve
[46:13] God by Revelation demand because I quote
[46:16] this the quote must become a reality man
[46:20] the quote must become a life
[46:23] and that's the life of God coming with
[46:26] this life you're living is not your life
[46:27] positive the life I now live I live by
[46:31] the faith of the Son of God who love me
[46:33] it's not you positive it's no longer I
[46:35] delivered but Christ delivers me amen so
[46:38] if you live in this life you're gonna
[46:40] treat one day something is not gonna
[46:41] make you fall amen but if Christ is
[46:44] inside you you will never fall a man
[46:46] because he is the wording
[46:49] so I look how that the Bible says
[46:52] without faith is impossible to please
[46:54] God
[46:55] but faith is a revelation and Bible says
[46:58] faith come by hearing and hearing the
[47:01] word of God
[47:02] and so once you hear the word the word
[47:04] transform you into what the word says
[47:07] you can be
[47:08] then the Bible said Abraham stagger not
[47:10] at the promise of God through unbelief
[47:11] he don't care hey remember how many I
[47:14] mean how many children are not a man and
[47:16] you're you're a child of Abraham by
[47:18] being born again or the seat or the sea
[47:20] the true see Jesus Christ amen anybody
[47:22] said Abraham
[47:23] stack it not at the promise of God
[47:27] the longer God took
[47:30] the stronger Abraham got because Abraham
[47:33] was not lean on his flesh
[47:35] he wanted he wasn't either way he he
[47:37] could do he was lean on what God word
[47:40] said what could be done
[47:42] and when Once God's word come I go forth
[47:45] it cannot return void now if God say you
[47:48] heal you heal him if God see you back
[47:50] and bride if God say you're gonna make
[47:53] it you're gonna make it a man
[47:55] you don't look at what you see with your
[47:56] eyes you look by faith amen
[47:59] so Abraham about said he staggered not
[48:02] at the promise of God he didn't get
[48:04] weaker Saints he got stronger
[48:06] that's a lot of times the bribes
[48:10] I thought I ain't tired yet
[48:14] some people that start running and they
[48:16] got tired now it's amazing how they
[48:18] don't you know you don't run this far
[48:20] you can how they can see the finish line
[48:22] I can sit there you can you can see the
[48:24] feeling and you want to turn and what
[48:26] you gonna turn back to amen I come too
[48:29] far to turn around now man I got to go
[48:31] early man hit people turn around my
[48:35] faith was not tired of people who turn
[48:36] around my faith was in God
[48:41] so if you turn around ain't got nothing
[48:42] to do with me amen cause I'm tied to God
[48:44] and wife don't go I still because it's
[48:47] not me and wife it's me and God it's not
[48:50] me and children me and brother man is
[48:52] you and God Amen
[48:55] God ain't got no grandchildren
[48:58] you must know God for yourself
[49:00] you can't pick it back on this thing man
[49:02] you must know God for yourself amen so
[49:04] it amazing way where people where some
[49:06] people they they serving they certainly
[49:08] they serve God for a long time
[49:10] and somebody somebody they know stop
[49:12] serving God and it affects their walk
[49:16] that shows you ain't got you a true
[49:17] revelation
[49:19] because the Bible tells me the Bible
[49:20] said Enoch walk with God
[49:24] DK what his wife done they came with
[49:27] children done either had his one mind
[49:28] I'ma please God
[49:30] in the morning and once he had that
[49:32] mindset God said there's a man right
[49:34] here he's a candidate he's the world
[49:37] ain't worth nothing
[49:38] I'ma show the people in 2023 they're
[49:41] just not eating out if they believe me
[49:43] they would take a Rapture I'll say man
[49:46] because Enoch is our type amen but one
[49:48] thing about Enoch he pleased God
[49:50] whatever God said do amen Enoch said
[49:53] amen to amen remember you can't figure
[49:56] out God
[49:57] you don't debate with God you believe
[49:59] God if God say he's going to do it it's
[50:02] already done
[50:05] if God people said if God say you healed
[50:08] if the Bible say buy your stripes buy
[50:10] his stripes you are healed you heal
[50:13] okay what the doctor say okay with the
[50:15] report say God see I'm here I'm healed
[50:17] amen because God cannot lie man
[50:22] so we see Abraham Enoch said because
[50:25] Enoch said Enoch was translated right
[50:27] quickly man we're gonna be long but my
[50:29] point is this when you please God he
[50:32] gonna make everything work out for you
[50:35] how many guys we all got children
[50:37] will you tell your children to go do
[50:39] something you tell us at that time I got
[50:40] I'm Melanie she's not here tonight we
[50:41] went down Atlanta last night she was she
[50:43] was missionary now last night she was we
[50:44] got home at one o'clock last night she
[50:46] got up seven o'clock hey my Commandments
[50:49] much more God
[50:54] have a man because God said well we say
[50:57] if you were bad at me and my words abide
[51:00] in you you can ask what you really man
[51:02] but you must please God and you please
[51:05] God by keeping it not summon his word
[51:07] you keep all this wording
[51:10] amen
[51:12] not in his age if everybody this age is
[51:14] so glamorized and so so set up for
[51:17] everybody want to please one another
[51:18] they want to please man it's already
[51:20] good good but man can't do it so much
[51:22] amen but will you please God he'll work
[51:25] it out for you amen I don't know how
[51:27] many guys how many know how many know
[51:28] how many you can tell us hey Trinity say
[51:30] that God Is A Healer
[51:32] that God is a way maker that God is a
[51:36] heart is a heart fixed amen happy
[51:38] confusing I say I know God Can Make A
[51:40] Way man
[51:42] see but the Bible says he's a high
[51:44] priest of your profession
[51:46] and the brothers of that profession
[51:47] means your confession anyway and when
[51:50] you speak something remember you are now
[51:53] the the spoken word is the Original Seed
[51:55] and we advise if you if you doubt if you
[51:58] have faith and don't doubt whatever you
[52:00] have you can have because my seed my
[52:02] word cannot return void if you only
[52:05] believe coming with faith is a something
[52:08] we reveal to you that the devocation
[52:10] goes it's not it didn't cover it ain't
[52:12] covered no man it came straight from God
[52:16] quick testimony how many God's still
[52:18] moving
[52:19] and the Bible says faith without works
[52:21] is dead
[52:26] but you got faith
[52:28] favorite action amen your fake or say
[52:30] your favorite gonna say stay home your
[52:32] face I'm gonna come to church amen even
[52:34] if I'm tired how many was high tonight
[52:38] but I command my body to praise the Lord
[52:42] see there's some people realize the
[52:44] spoken word is the original sin will you
[52:47] speak stop and believe in it it cannot
[52:49] return void and God will make your body
[52:51] obey your confession amen
[52:55] about two weeks ago I heard my arm real
[52:57] bad at work couldn't I couldn't even
[52:59] hardly move it every time I moved it was
[53:01] hurting like at night time hurting I
[53:03] mean it's amazing
[53:04] at night time with any pain it magnifies
[53:07] by a thousand a man
[53:09] but I was so glad we man do it for a
[53:11] night but joy come in the morning man
[53:14] so I'm always hurting my mom and I think
[53:16] I'm watching so take some time now I'm
[53:17] saying I I want to take medicine I'm not
[53:20] going to mess up you want to take myself
[53:21] just say take some time now so I took a
[53:23] couple Tylenols
[53:24] and the pain was was that went away and
[53:28] it came right back
[53:30] and some say look at what Tylenol does
[53:32] do you realize that God don't know how
[53:35] Tylenol affect your body but whether it
[53:37] tricks your mind and thinking that the
[53:39] pain ain't there we get it still there
[53:43] so we're tying our way out with you you
[53:45] feel the pain is always there but
[53:47] Tylenol got something inside and trick
[53:49] your brain they say the pain ain't there
[53:51] that's how people get hooked on
[53:52] painkillers
[53:54] because why Tylenol does not heal
[53:57] it is Tay to bring dead body the pain
[54:00] ain't there but yet it's still there
[54:02] but they say Carlos thing does not as
[54:04] though they were
[54:06] so I said if Tylenol can do this for
[54:09] eight hours what can Faith do
[54:11] so as people say I'm Healed I'm still
[54:14] hurting but I'm Healed
[54:16] I'm Healed
[54:18] and one day I became healer Cody guy why
[54:22] faith without works is dead brother fake

[54:27] obey your confession amen
[54:30] now my arm is stronger than every man
[54:33] cause by faith amen
[54:38] by favor
[54:41] by Faith by faith I'm a Christian amen
[54:44] by faithful record about amen by faith
[54:47] I'm overcoming a man it's all by faith
[54:50] amen
[54:51] when you speak the word amen
[54:54] your word becomes life and it cannot
[54:56] return of oh waiting
[54:58] look it up signs don't know wow title
[55:02] now work but when they do know it should
[55:03] you might think the pain ain't there
[55:04] when it's still right there
[55:06] but faith can take the pain away
[55:08] you with me there's a blind man say he
[55:11] say I thought you say you believe I say
[55:13] I thought you say you were I say I
[55:15] thought you say you I thought he said I
[55:17] thought you would say I was healed

[1:00:10] because they release they releasing The
[1:00:12] energy they don't even feel the cold

[1:01:56] maker he's a chain breaker he's a hard
[1:01:59] fixer and start praising God and God
[1:02:02] came down and broke the chains amen

[1:02:09] will you praise God
[1:02:11] it confuses the enemy okay my brother

[1:02:16] created I was born to praise God
[1:02:22] please God
[1:02:24] when you please God he give you what you
[1:02:26] want
[1:02:27] your assistant had it right
[1:02:29] she pleased God
[1:02:31] she she remember said I had to write
[1:02:33] this on the dish they gave twenty
[1:02:34] dollars for the beautiful fund to the
[1:02:36] handy right made communion for the whole
[1:02:37] church but yeah she was a post sister
[1:02:39] had a broken down mother and father had
[1:02:42] bad children but she still praised God
[1:02:45] and she one day she praise God so much
[1:02:47] because I must come down to her house
[1:02:50] because she pleasing me I'm gonna do
[1:02:53] something my sister and brother said she

[1:03:14] he was talking to squirrels and the
[1:03:15] silver chick reads A bear and we all
[1:03:18] know without faith without Revelation
[1:03:20] it's impossible to please God remember
[1:03:22] she was not dead when brother babe was
[1:03:24] doing those things but yet she believed
[1:03:25] a man I was not there when he
[1:03:28] when Moses partnered Red Sea but I
[1:03:30] believe they man in the same God part of
[1:03:33] the Red Sea he departure red she's not a
[1:03:34] man he is still God Amen so it makes no

[1:04:04] the Bible said because remember 2
[1:04:06] million came out but only two please God
[1:04:09] the rest died in the wilderness
[1:04:14] because they did not make sure they was
[1:04:16] hearing with faith they got out in the
[1:04:18] wilderness and forgot it was not most of
[1:04:21] us keeping them it was God keeping them
[1:04:24] so when he murdered against Moses they

[1:09:08] foreign
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:22] God Amen
[1:09:24] I thought about that scripture let the
[1:09:25] words of my mouth and the meditation of
[1:09:28] my heart be acceptable in my sight
[1:09:30] everything we do we want to please God
[1:09:32] Amen he was going on telling him talking
[1:09:35] about his arm and so many I thought
[1:09:37] about so many testimonies I said if we
[1:09:39] had testimony service we wouldn't go
[1:09:41] home tonight talking about the goodness
[1:09:43] of God and how faithful he is so here's
[1:09:46] the word I'll say a lot of times you
[1:09:48] know we could have been healed we could
[1:09:50] have been delivered could have been out
[1:09:51] of our troubles but God was waiting on
[1:09:53] our faith to hit that level
[1:09:55] God was letting us sometimes go around
[1:09:57] and everything else fail you and then
[1:09:59] you come to that point the way you say
[1:10:01] God I'm just going to trust in you and
[1:10:03] he came through every time didn't he God
[1:10:06] is so good it's good always to hear what
[1:10:08] God is doing and you know sometimes we
[1:10:10] can talk about what God has done but to
[1:10:12] talk about what God is doing now that
[1:10:15] just ignites your faith it'll cause you
[1:10:17] and your situation you know to go back
[1:10:19] and say Lord if you did it for brother
[1:10:21] Jenkins I know you can do it for me Lord
[1:10:23] God if you did it for this one or that
[1:10:25] one Lord I know you can do it for me
[1:10:27] Lord help me help me like this I believe
[1:10:30] Lord help my unbelief how many believe
[1:10:32] that tonight amen God is so good you
[1:10:35] know we serve awesome God tonight don't
[1:10:37] we we serve a mighty like I say all the
[1:10:40] time we serve a mighty mighty good God
[1:10:42] don't we we don't even understand the
[1:10:45] goodness of God and how good he is to us
[1:10:48] you know until we have those times when
[1:10:51] you know like he says in the bad times
[1:10:52] you know that's that's when the real
[1:10:55] anointing seemed to come in the in the
[1:10:57] dark times in the bad times in the
[1:10:59] Midnight Hour you know everything is
[1:11:01] going good you can shout and dance and
[1:11:03] praise God but when you're really going
[1:11:05] through and you're really in a rut like
[1:11:08] they say sometimes and then you find a
[1:11:10] way to praise God it looks like then in
[1:11:12] that place you know I believe like it's
[1:11:14] talking about Paul and Silas they could
[1:11:16] praise God and have good services but in
[1:11:19] that prison after being beaten after
[1:11:21] being all that and locked up and in the
[1:11:23] Midnight Hour and you can hear them
[1:11:24] begin to sing and I believe the like I
[1:11:27] said the real anointing come down and
[1:11:29] break the chains it's something about
[1:11:31] but you know to get those testimonies
[1:11:33] you got to get in those conditions
[1:11:35] sometimes we don't want we don't want
[1:11:37] those conditions we just want the
[1:11:39] victory or the testimonies after those
[1:11:40] conditions but we don't want the
[1:11:42] Shipwreck the snake bitten thrown in
[1:11:44] jail the beatons and all that we don't
[1:11:46] want that but we want the testimonies
[1:11:48] don't we but nevertheless God brings us
[1:11:51] through those things he brought us to it
[1:11:53] and he'll bring us through it won't he
[1:11:54] God is so good tonight I'm stirred
