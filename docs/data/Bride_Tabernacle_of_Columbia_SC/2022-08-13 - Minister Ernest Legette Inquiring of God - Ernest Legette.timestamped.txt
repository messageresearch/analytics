[36:17] grace and your mercy your goodness
[36:20] towards us
[36:21] lord we thank you in jesus christ's name
[36:24] we pray amen and amen
[36:27] god is good amen
[36:29] we want to look at the book of second
[36:31] kings about god's grace
[36:33] second kings three
[36:35] and
[36:36] we'll begin here at the
[36:41] after let's begin at the
[36:44] sixth verse
[36:49] read a little bit
[36:56] second kings three and six if you got it
[36:58] say amen
[37:00] and it reads and the king jehoram went
[37:03] out of samaria at the same time and
[37:05] numbered all israel and he went and and
[37:09] and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the
[37:11] king of judah saying the king of moab
[37:13] ever bailed against me well thou go with
[37:16] me against moab to battle and he said i
[37:19] will go up and i am as thou art my
[37:21] people as thy people and my horses as
[37:23] thou horses and he said which way shall
[37:26] we go up and he answered the way through
[37:28] the wilderness of edom so the king of
[37:31] israel went in the king of judah and the
[37:33] king of edom and they fetch the compass
[37:35] and of seven days journey and there was
[37:37] no water for the host and for the cattle
[37:40] that followed them and the king of
[37:42] israel said at last
[37:43] that the lord hath called these three
[37:46] kings together to deliver them into the
[37:49] hand of moab but jehoshaphat said is
[37:51] there not here a prophet of the lord
[37:54] that we may inquire by of the lord by
[37:56] him
[37:57] and one of the king of israel's servants
[38:01] answered and said here is elisha the son
[38:04] of shafat which poured water on the
[38:06] hands of elijah you may be seated
[38:09] i'll read a little further down
[38:12] the 12th verse says in jehoshaphat said
[38:14] the word of the lord is with him so the
[38:16] king of israel and jehoshaphat the king
[38:18] of edom went down to him and elisha said
[38:21] unto the king of israel what have i to
[38:23] do with thee get thee to the prophets of
[38:25] thy father and the prophets of thy
[38:27] mother the king of israel said said unto
[38:30] him name for the lord hath called these
[38:32] three kings together to deliver them
[38:34] into the hand
[38:36] and of moab and elisha said as the lord
[38:39] of hosts liveth before whom i stand
[38:41] surely were it not
[38:44] that i regard the presence of the of
[38:47] jehoshaphat the king of judah i would
[38:49] not have
[38:51] looked toward thee nor see thee but now
[38:53] bring me a minstrel and came to pass and
[38:56] when the minstrel played that the hand
[38:58] of the lord came upon him and he said
[39:01] thus saith the lord make this valley
[39:04] full of ditches
[39:05] for thus saith the lord you shall not
[39:07] see wind neither neither shall you see
[39:10] rain
[39:10] yet the valley shall be filled with
[39:12] water and that ye may drink both you and
[39:15] your cattle and your beasts and this is
[39:18] but a light thing in the sight of the
[39:20] lord he will deliver the moabites also
[39:22] into your hand and you shall smite every
[39:25] city every choice city and shall fail
[39:27] every good tree
[39:29] and stop all the wells of water and mar
[39:32] every good place of land with stones my
[39:35] god the bless to the reading of his word
[39:37] tonight
[39:38] by the grace of god
[39:40] just for a moment i want to minister
[39:43] on a little topic
[39:45] and i
[39:46] i entitled it
[39:48] inquiring of the lord
[39:51] and with a sub-topic did you pray about
[39:53] it amen
[39:55] did you pray about it
[39:57] you know i was looking here and how in
[39:59] the scriptures and a little something i
[40:00] was ministering on on sunday too but you
[40:03] know a little bit how
[40:05] you know israel at this time said in the
[40:07] scriptures how they were divided as a
[40:09] nation you know one point they were one
[40:12] people but then you know something took
[40:14] place and they they got divided and all
[40:17] but so there was a time they had split
[40:19] up
[40:20] but you know
[40:22] you know their strength was in their
[40:23] unity
[40:25] so as long as they were divided they
[40:27] were vulnerable
[40:28] and you know that's what the devil does
[40:31] i believe a lot of times to the people
[40:33] in a lot of churches today
[40:36] a lot of fellowships what he want to do
[40:37] he want to keep the people divided
[40:40] as long as he keeps you divided without
[40:42] that unity
[40:43] uh he it makes you that much more
[40:46] vulnerable and that's what i was sharing
[40:48] you know sunday morning i was saying you
[40:50] know
[40:51] you know we're not an organization
[40:53] or denomination but we every church is
[40:57] sovereign in itself but we still
[40:59] fellowship with one another because we
[41:01] carry the same beliefs
[41:03] and i said that that fellowship
[41:04] strengthens you when you find yourself
[41:07] on the island out there by yourself
[41:09] then that's when you find yourself more
[41:11] vulnerable
[41:12] but when you stay together come on
[41:15] and you stay in fellowship that you know
[41:17] when the enemy comes to attack
[41:19] you know like i was saying on sunday
[41:21] we're in a battle you're going to war
[41:23] and you're going to need somebody to
[41:24] help go to war with you i said what
[41:27] happens what what we do when we try to
[41:30] isolate ourselves i says then you say
[41:32] that ain't none of my business that
[41:33] ain't that ain't me but when the devil
[41:35] get done with them
[41:37] guess what he gonna do he gonna come to
[41:39] you next
[41:40] come on but it makes a difference that i
[41:43] says that if i see this brother here or
[41:44] this sister here going through or this
[41:46] church here or that church going through
[41:48] that we get down on our knees and we
[41:49] pray for them
[41:51] pray that god we go to war i said what
[41:53] it is then we don't give the devil no
[41:55] rest
[41:56] when because it's always somebody
[41:58] praying always somebody on their knees
[42:01] got you on their mind lord help him help
[42:03] him the devil don't get no rest does he
[42:05] and then what happens you know god shows
[42:08] up and that's that's what that's what
[42:10] the the strength and the unity is all
[42:13] about but that's what you know i said a
[42:15] lot of times
[42:16] you know what happens as i was i was
[42:18] saying you know the other day in
[42:20] churches you'll find out that everybody
[42:22] want to be the pastor
[42:24] or everybody want to be in charge and
[42:26] all these things you know and that says
[42:28] and that's what usually causes you know
[42:30] things to split that people have their
[42:32] groups you got your group they got their
[42:34] group but what it is that's the devil's
[42:36] job to do that
[42:37] to keep the holy ghost from falling you
[42:39] know it says that when they were in one
[42:41] place come on there's a one mind we know
[42:44] there's on one accord what happened the
[42:45] holy ghost fell down
[42:47] you know and that's what it is i don't
[42:49] know about you but i said that's what we
[42:50] want when we come together one mind one
[42:53] accord
[42:54] come on one mind that we want to see god
[42:56] move
[42:57] we want to see the supernatural we want
[42:58] to see the power of god we want to see
[43:01] somebody get healed
[43:02] we want to see somebody get saved we
[43:04] want to see somebody get delivered come
[43:06] on and when we all come with that mind
[43:08] come on and our mind is staring on him i
[43:11] said watch god moved in come on but what
[43:13] happens the devil comes in and he
[43:16] hey you just worried about you you just
[43:18] worried about you and all these things
[43:19] and that's what it is it's no unity
[43:21] there i said but watch watch what the
[43:23] devil does now i says when you sit there
[43:26] and watch the devil just attack them and
[43:28] you don't get down on your knees and
[43:29] pray when that's so witty coming to your
[43:31] house next
[43:32] come on
[43:33] we say that so many times even in the
[43:35] natural sometimes you look at it like in
[43:39] certain wars you could take world war ii
[43:41] for example they sat back and watched
[43:43] all right yeah he attacking this country
[43:45] uh uh hitler hitting there we ain't
[43:46] gonna worry about him we just gonna then
[43:48] he took over him took over and took over
[43:50] them and now
[43:51] you don't have enough resources to fight
[43:53] the enemy come on
[43:56] he's way stronger than you and i said
[43:59] that's what it is you and i as brothers
[44:01] and sisters in christ come on
[44:04] the blood of jesus christ has made us
[44:06] ken
[44:07] right come on brought us so nigh to one
[44:10] another hallelujah mata didn't know you
[44:12] until you until we came into the faith
[44:15] but nevertheless you are still my
[44:17] brother you still my sister when you
[44:19] hurt i heard come on when your children
[44:21] are going through i'm going through
[44:22] hallelujah when we find ourselves with
[44:24] that type of burden watch we'll come
[44:26] together how many believe that tonight
[44:29] what i say is that even you know we find
[44:31] that and i just want to you know like i
[44:33] said as we talk about inquiring of the
[44:35] lord but where there where there's unity
[44:38] you know uh uh there there's there's
[44:40] strength come on
[44:42] the devil don't like that
[44:44] he don't like the people the brother in
[44:46] the dwelling unity
[44:48] he don't like that he always want to
[44:50] keep this one pit against that one
[44:53] i always want to keep this uh this
[44:55] quarrels come on because he know like i
[44:58] was sharing with the church on sunday
[45:00] remember you got coral you got all you
[45:02] might as well not even get down to your
[45:03] knees and pray
[45:04] because the bible says god ain't even
[45:06] going to hear you
[45:07] you got to make that thing right come on
[45:09] these things are real then you wonder
[45:11] sometimes why you can't get a
[45:13] breakthrough why god didn't seem like he
[45:14] answered your prayer search your life
[45:17] search your heart search yourself see
[45:20] whether or not you lined up with the
[45:22] word of god or not come on then you can
[45:24] it's something about when you know that
[45:26] the channel is clear hallelujah you know
[45:28] that prayer is different
[45:31] when you know the channel's clear when
[45:33] you know things are right that's a
[45:34] different prayer
[45:36] that's a prayer that god hallelujah god
[45:39] hears
[45:40] nobody else heard it but god heard it
[45:43] you know a lot of times people spoke
[45:45] they said things nobody heard it but god
[45:47] heard it
[45:48] come on and that made all the difference
[45:50] that when god heard that cry or when god
[45:54] heard that prayer but just like as he
[45:55] hears your heart's crying that way he
[45:58] also hears your hearts crying a negative
[45:59] way as well come on and all of that
[46:02] makes a difference how many believe that
[46:04] tonight so what does it teach us to do
[46:06] watch what we say
[46:08] watch what we think even in our spirit
[46:11] come on
[46:12] i missed it once on what did heaven hear
[46:15] i said sometimes you can not even say
[46:17] things from your mouth but just by your
[46:19] actions when it got up to heaven it had
[46:21] a cry come on
[46:23] it created your actions created a voice
[46:26] and god heard what you said even though
[46:29] you said i didn't say it hallelujah but
[46:32] god heard it anyway
[46:33] when it got up to heaven that's how it
[46:35] hurt that's how it was heard so we what
[46:37] do we say lord search our hearts try our
[46:40] reigns keep us clean keep us pure lord
[46:43] that when it goes up to heaven god all
[46:45] you get is a sweet spell and savior
[46:47] praises going up to you hallelujah i
[46:50] don't know about you but that's where i
[46:51] said we want to be at come on
[46:53] in our hearts that's the only way we're
[46:55] going to take a rapture that's the only
[46:57] way i said the the thing is like was
[47:00] talking saying here you know the king of
[47:02] israel and those that they were afraid
[47:04] because moab was coming and they knew
[47:06] that hey by ourselves we ain't going be
[47:09] able to face them
[47:11] by ourselves you know we're gonna be
[47:13] destroyed come on we got to come
[47:14] together i see jehoshaphat saying you
[47:17] know
[47:18] yo
[47:19] we as one mine is yours but you know he
[47:22] was joking up with some unbelief though
[47:24] come on so that's why we said you can't
[47:26] just joke up with anything now come on
[47:28] and expect god to bless that that's not
[47:30] what we're talking about but we're
[47:32] talking about those of light faith come
[47:34] on
[47:35] those hallelujah the household of god do
[47:38] you believe that tonight
[47:40] come on because now we're fighting what
[47:42] are we fighting fighting these plagues
[47:45] fighting demon powers fighting things
[47:47] that we can't see so we got to go to war
[47:50] how we gonna go to the wall you got to
[47:52] put your spiritual we got to get your
[47:53] spiritual warfare come on you got to
[47:55] grab the shield of faith the prophet of
[47:57] god was saying something about faith he
[47:59] was saying when you're trying to figure
[48:01] figure it out then that's why that's why
[48:04] many times people can't get the miracles
[48:06] they can't get the healings because they
[48:07] trying to figure it out they thinking
[48:09] about it too much
[48:10] don't think about it believe god and go
[48:12] on
[48:13] we always tell people bring your burdens
[48:16] to the lord and leave them there don't
[48:18] get up worrying about it thinking about
[48:20] it put it on the altar lay it at the
[48:21] cross
[48:23] hallelujah get up and don't worry about
[48:25] it your job is to praise god
[48:28] hallelujah you believe that tonight
[48:31] but you're thinking about it too much
[48:33] come on you didn't leave it there
[48:35] you carried it to the lord but then you
[48:37] took it back home with you
[48:40] you got off your knees and you carried
[48:41] it with you come on
[48:43] but you know i was praying on something
[48:45] the other day i was thinking about
[48:46] something and uh they're dealing with
[48:49] but it's something about rising up early
[48:51] in the morning
[48:53] and getting down on your knees and
[48:54] praying hallelujah asking god to make
[48:57] the way for you something about that
[48:58] come on but as i got down on my knees in
[49:01] prayer it's like it's like the divine
[49:04] inspiration or something just came to me
[49:06] and showed me exactly how to take care
[49:07] of the situation
[49:09] i thought about it i said lord see
[49:10] that's how god works
[49:12] you spend all your time trying to figure
[49:14] it out trying to worry about it doing
[49:16] all this come on but if you're got down
[49:18] on your knees
[49:19] like we're saying of the week if you'd
[49:20] have been still
[49:22] took it to god in prayer inspiration may
[49:24] have come hallelujah god would have
[49:26] showed you how to work that thing out
[49:28] and you to god up saying lord i didn't
[49:30] even think about that way come on but if
[49:32] you're the only inquired of the lord
[49:34] hallelujah ask god about it hallelujah
[49:38] that's why i said did you pray about it
[49:39] come on
[49:41] but we find that you know that's what
[49:43] something i was stirred up about that he
[49:45] says you thinking about it too much come
[49:47] on
[49:47] don't that faith is you just take it you
[49:50] believe and go on
[49:51] because it ain't your business to bring
[49:53] it to pass come on god is god's business
[49:56] to keep his word
[49:57] and once we learn that miracles will
[49:59] start happening
[50:00] come on things will start coming
[50:02] together things will begin working out
[50:04] for you because you learn how to give it
[50:06] to god hallelujah
[50:08] but we find that i says you know that
[50:10] that you know they they found themselves
[50:12] they came together and i know i want to
[50:14] kind of speed along but i says and even
[50:16] though they came together and he saw
[50:18] that the enemy was coming no he couldn't
[50:21] stand with him so he says come on we got
[50:22] to come together but the biggest mistake
[50:24] they made was that
[50:26] when they went on this journey but when
[50:27] they come together they never inquired
[50:29] of the lord
[50:31] the bible says they went on so many days
[50:33] journey of compass and then they found
[50:35] themselves stranded out there in the
[50:37] desert come on
[50:38] found themselves stranded in a place
[50:40] where they had no water
[50:42] hallelujah then after they got to that
[50:45] place then they realized now we're in
[50:47] worse shape now than we were from the
[50:49] beginning
[50:50] i said that's what it is it ain't just
[50:52] about coming together come on and just
[50:54] talking and running them out and all
[50:55] these other things come on then you
[50:57] might find yourself in worse shape
[50:59] hallelujah but somebody got to be
[51:01] spiritual in the camp somebody got to
[51:03] have spiritual discernment
[51:05] somebody got to know what god is doing
[51:07] how many believe that tonight
[51:09] hallelujah
