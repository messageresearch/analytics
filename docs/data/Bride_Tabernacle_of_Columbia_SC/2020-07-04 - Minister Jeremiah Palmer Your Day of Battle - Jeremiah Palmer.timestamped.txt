[25:00] the 20th chapter
[25:04] i'm reminded of paul
[25:12] admonishing
[25:18] the people to be strong
[25:22] in the lord let me be seated
[25:28] notice he letting them know that it's
[25:31] not
[25:32] your script
[25:35] but it's the lord's script
[25:40] and he said in the power of his might
[25:46] deuteronomy 21
[25:50] through 4.
[25:54] when thou goes out to battle
[25:57] against their enemies how many you know
[25:59] you got an enemy
[26:01] and the sea is horses and cherished in
[26:04] other words powers
[26:07] and a people more than thou
[26:11] be not afraid of them i like that amen
[26:15] in other words whatever you may
[26:19] see going on around you and with you
[26:22] don't be afraid of it
[26:26] for the lord thy god is with thee
[26:29] amen you know it's good to know god with
[26:33] you amen
[26:35] sometimes we feel that we are all alone
[26:38] but
[26:39] god is with us which
[26:42] brought thee up out of the land of egypt
[26:45] and it shall be when ye are come nigh
[26:49] unto the battle that the priest shall
[26:52] approach
[26:53] and speak unto the people and shall say
[26:56] unto them
[26:57] heal israel ye approach this day until
[27:01] battle
[27:02] against your enemies let not your hearts
[27:05] faint fear not
[27:09] and do not tremble neither be ye
[27:12] terrified because of them for the lord
[27:16] your god
[27:17] is he that goes with you to
[27:20] fight for you against your enemies
[27:24] to save you amen
[27:27] i like that amen god
[27:31] giving consolation
[27:35] giving courage
[27:39] that when you go out against your
[27:41] enemies
[27:42] don't be afraid of them
[27:46] though you may be outnumbered
[27:50] though you may be uh uh
[27:53] uh surrounded by a host of trouble
[27:56] in your life don't be afraid cause
[28:00] i'm with you
[28:03] jesus said i believe saint john said
[28:06] that i'll be
[28:07] with you even in you unto the end
[28:11] of the world i'm telling you i'm tell
[28:15] you
[28:16] something it's good you know you got
[28:19] somebody that got you back
[28:22] and god got you
[28:25] he is god that's
[28:29] mighty in battle
[28:32] and i want to speak to you a little bit
[28:34] tonight on
[28:37] your day of battle
[28:40] your day of battle
[28:44] i'm reminding something the servant of
[28:46] god spoke to us
[28:48] and he said that every inch of
[28:51] ground you get you're going to fight for
[28:54] it
[28:57] he also said that we are not on a
[29:00] picnic but we are on a battlefield
[29:05] i believe by now we we
[29:08] should understand be should understand
[29:12] that we have got to be ready to fight
[29:18] you have to know that your enemy
[29:22] my enemy is coming
[29:27] for battle
[29:30] are you ready for the battle
[29:33] when a battle is about to be arranged
[29:36] there must be a preparation
[29:42] even in the natural army they
[29:46] bring the soldiers in
[29:50] to basic training and they
[29:53] carried them through some rugged courses
[29:57] some very treacherous obstacles
[30:01] why because they'll realize that
[30:04] you're gonna need this
[30:07] they are trying to prepare them for
[30:11] anything that may happen because
[30:16] they may be going to war
[30:19] no doubt as their natural army trains
[30:23] uh their soldiers i believe that's what
[30:26] god is doing
[30:29] i believe for over 6 000 years that
[30:32] god has been arming us and equipping
[30:36] us with our weapons
[30:40] i believe one place i believe is
[30:42] corinthian
[30:43] uh corinthians said our weapons are not
[30:47] carnal but they are mighty through god
[30:51] amen
[30:52] pulling down strongholds in the
[30:55] imagination
[30:57] i'm i'm aware as i was sharing this you
[31:01] know
[31:02] a little bible study studying uh
[31:04] supposed to be been
[31:06] uh uh teaching but i got a little caught
[31:09] up
[31:10] you know because of what i was seeing
[31:12] and my wife said you are you kind of
[31:15] lost it didn't you
[31:17] and so i was trying just to
[31:20] show that uh you and i
[31:24] are in a battle there ain't no need for
[31:28] you to sit and cry about it or
[31:30] or to worry yourself with it you must
[31:33] understand
[31:34] for this purpose you were chosen
[31:39] see god chose us to be
[31:43] in the worst age there is in history
[31:48] who are facing some of the most uh uh
[31:52] treacherous things that uh the human has
[31:56] never had to deal with everything that
[32:01] we have and all around us
[32:03] is testifying that
[32:06] we're in a battle
[32:10] and you and i must understand that uh
[32:14] when god chose us he didn't choose us to
[32:18] lose
[32:20] he gave us the the greatest
[32:23] and a powerful weapon that you could
[32:26] ever have to fight the enemy with
[32:31] we know that weapon is the word amen
[32:35] that's what jesus used on the devil
[32:39] in the book of matthew that's the only
[32:43] weapon that can defeat the devil
[32:47] that word that's why i think one of the
[32:50] reasons why
[32:51] david said that i hear thy word in their
[32:54] heart
[32:55] that i may not sinned against thee but
[32:58] also that
[32:59] when you need the weapon of the word
[33:03] that
[33:03] if it's in you it'll come out
[33:10] yes sir i i like that how he said in
[33:13] deuteronomy
[33:15] he said
[33:21] and it should be when you're come not
[33:24] into the battle
[33:25] to preach your approach and speak unto
[33:28] the people
[33:29] and say unto them heal israel ye
[33:31] approach this day
[33:33] until battle against your enemies
[33:36] let not your heart faint
[33:40] don't faint because of the battle
[33:44] don't fear because of the battle
[33:48] come on god is more than able
[33:53] our god uh in this
[33:56] age especially has equipped us with
[34:00] something supernatural
[34:04] and these weapons that we have i'm
[34:07] afraid sometimes that
[34:09] we don't understand what the word
[34:12] is and what it came to do
[34:18] but it came to cut the devil in
[34:21] every situation but you have to know
[34:25] what is in your hand
[34:30] look at moses i think about him
[34:34] moses after god
[34:39] trained him on the back side of the
[34:42] desert
[34:43] 40 years
[34:47] moses had lost all human
[34:50] confidence that he could do anything
[34:55] and i realized that's what god wanted to
[34:58] get us at
[35:00] he wants you to lose all of your
[35:03] humanistic
[35:04] confidence that you young and you strong
[35:08] and
[35:08] you smart no no no no god can't use that
[35:14] and god has to carry us alone somewhere
[35:18] uh and give us a personal experience
[35:23] because you're gonna need it
[35:26] you won't be able to fight with fleshly
[35:29] things
[35:30] or carnal thing but because this is a
[35:33] spiritual warfare
[35:37] so god understanding that
[35:42] the real battle really started in heaven
[35:46] and then it came to earth
[35:50] satan lost up there and he's surely
[35:53] going to lose down here
[35:56] the silver god spoke of message one in a
[35:58] million
[36:00] there's gonna be a people that's
[36:04] going to stand against the wiles
[36:07] of the devil and they're
[36:10] not gonna be losers they're gonna be
[36:13] victorious
[36:15] why because greater is he
[36:18] that is in you and he that is in the
[36:21] world
[36:24] yes it doesn't matter what comes
[36:31] it doesn't matter
[36:34] what happens around you and with you
[36:39] yeah you might even get sick but you got
[36:42] a god
[36:43] who is a healer
[36:46] not even death can hold you down
[36:52] paul said oh death where is thy stain
[36:56] oh grave where is thy victory
[37:00] paul understood that nothing
[37:04] could separate him from the love of god
[37:08] i like to tell you today the bible say
[37:10] one place that
[37:12] no weapon form against you
[37:16] shall prosper he didn't say it won't
[37:20] come but he said it shall not prosper
[37:25] see because things may come at you and
[37:28] things may happen to you but
[37:30] it won't prosper
[37:34] why because god has given you
[37:37] something amen i believe you say one
[37:40] place that
[37:40] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[37:44] spirit of the lord
[37:45] are raised up a standard against it amen
[37:51] i know for example you know
[37:54] just battling you know in your body
[37:59] another day i had another
[38:03] incident you know
[38:06] with my legs again
[38:09] twisted swole up real
[38:13] big and i said lord look at this devil
[38:17] here
[38:19] you back again
[38:22] and then i got one feeling well and then
[38:25] the other one go to hurt
[38:28] i said lord jesus this devil don't
[38:32] stop and i said that's all right i'm not
[38:36] looking at the symptoms
[38:40] i'm not looking at how i feel
[38:44] i'm not looking even at what my legs are
[38:48] even doing
[38:49] though they swell i'm calling those
[38:52] things
[38:53] as though they are not i believe your
[38:56] sister wanted me to sing a song
[38:58] satan you may stare you may fight but
[39:01] you're going to lose this battle tonight
[39:04] you can't cross the bloodline
[39:07] no matter what you do devil you can't
[39:10] win
[39:11] yes weeping man endure for a night
[39:14] but joy
[39:17] come in the morning
[39:21] you know you look at your body and
[39:25] look at what's going on around you
[39:29] you ain't careful your heart will start
[39:33] fretting fear
[39:38] a start want to start gripping you
[39:41] then your mind get the wandering off

[40:39] i said because it's not going to stop
[40:43] we're living in the closing of time now
[40:47] i was going to speak on one time the end
[40:49] of all things
[40:52] we are living in the end of all things
[40:55] now
[40:55] that this battle is going to rage even
[40:58] more
[40:59] so you and i have to understand that
[41:04] uh you didn't just come to church to be
[41:07] coming to church
[41:09] but you come to church amen to get
[41:12] ready for your day of battle
[41:16] someone might say well brother i'm all
[41:19] right
[41:20] and nothing is going on keep on living
[41:25] i used to wonder and heal the old people
[41:28] said
[41:29] you know you keep on living a little
[41:31] while then you'll understand
[41:33] what we are saying and now i see
[41:37] in this physical body
[41:41] in this satanic demonic
[41:44] world that we are living in
[41:47] we're up against principalities
[41:52] powers spiritual wickedness
[41:56] demons that out to kill
[42:00] steal and destroy you
[42:03] he doesn't care how or or when
[42:06] or what he uses he's out to
[42:09] take us out of here he's out to
[42:13] make you uh like joke cursed your god
[42:17] and die
[42:20] but god had confidence in job
[42:23] i like to say god got confidence in you
[42:28] god begin to tell satan
[42:32] uh have you considered my servant a
[42:35] perfect and upright man
[42:39] oh i imagine satan didn't like that god
[42:42] called job perfect
[42:44] and upright and he said oh he
[42:47] he served you because of what you're
[42:50] blessing him with
[42:52] he said you take all those natural
[42:55] blessings
[42:56] he said he'll curse you to your face
[42:59] see but god knew better than that
[43:03] god know better than you also god got
[43:06] more confidence
[43:07] in you than you got in your own self
[43:11] knows that you can't stand the testes
[43:16] he'll deign you for it
[43:20] he's here to prepare us
[43:25] because we're living in one of the
[43:26] worstest time there ever was
[43:29] i was saying one time to someone i said
[43:31] that we are actually
[43:33] making history we are
[43:36] writing the continuation of the bible
[43:41] it's been spoken of us
[43:44] that god will have himself a bride that
[43:47] won't defile
[43:48] herself she won't uh
[43:52] uh turn back on god but
[43:55] she'll go forward regardless of what's
[43:58] going on
[44:02] the bible says one place fear not little
[44:04] flock
[44:06] he said but it's your father good
[44:08] pleasure
[44:10] they give you the kingdom
[44:13] let's turn also to the book of uh
[44:17] second chronicles
[44:34] yes
[44:39] 20.
[44:46] hopefully that
[44:49] i can try to talk a little bit about
[44:51] david
[44:54] but ii chronicles 20
[45:00] and 15.
[45:04] and he said hearkening y'all judah
[45:08] and the inhabitants of jerusalem
[45:12] and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the
[45:15] lord unto you be
[45:18] not afraid nor dismayed by reason
[45:21] of this great multitude
[45:24] for the battle is not yours
[45:27] but gods
[45:31] i like that word of comfort that
[45:35] your battle in my battle
[45:38] is not mine but it's god's
[45:43] we must understand that it's not my
[45:46] might not by power but by his spirit
[45:54] we overcame by the blood of the lamb in
[45:56] the word of his testimony
[46:01] the battle that is set before us is
[46:04] already won
[46:09] we must understand that we
[46:13] have have not chosen this way
[46:17] but god chose us for it
[46:21] god knew that this generation
[46:24] this very hour would come
[46:29] and he would have some people that
[46:32] that that had been trained by god
[46:37] to be steadfast unremovable
[46:41] not fearful but will
[46:45] walk by faith and not by sight
[46:50] they will not look at their
[46:53] circumstances
[46:54] or their condition they're looking up
[46:59] for which cometh all their help
[47:03] that's what you got to look to
[47:07] especially in this hour especially
[47:11] in this cycle of time
[47:17] as we hear so many things
[47:20] transpiring country
[47:24] after country the political
[47:28] economically spiritually
[47:33] everything seemed to be chaotic
[47:37] nothing is certain anymore
[47:42] everything has been shooken of course
[47:46] nothing that you can put your hopes in
[47:51] that can give you comfort
[47:56] the doctors have done all they could do
[47:59] thank god for them medically they have
[48:02] done all they could do
[48:05] yet in all of the good effort they are
[48:08] laboring like they're laboring
[48:12] they still can't find the answer
[48:17] where is the answer to what we need
[48:22] is there no bomb in gideon
[48:26] is there no physician here
[48:30] that can handle cover 19.
[48:34] is that a god in america
[48:38] that sits high and looks low
[48:43] and understand that oh
[48:46] if my people that are called by my name
[48:52] all if they are humble themselves and
[48:54] pray
[48:55] turn from their wicked ways
[48:59] there is a bomb
[49:02] there is a physician
[49:06] his name is jesus christ
[49:12] the one that specializes
[49:15] in everything nothing you have
[49:20] nothing going on that god can handle
[49:26] god is saying i am the answer
[49:30] turn to me look unto me
[49:35] i am the way the truth in the life
[49:40] i'm the creator i'm the one
[49:44] that was and is and shall be again
[49:48] what are you looking for your answers
[49:52] right here oh
[49:57] just imagine
[50:00] the very answer
[50:04] that everybody is looking for
[50:09] is right here
[50:14] they're trying to get an antidote
[50:20] something that may work and may not
[50:24] i pray that it does
[50:29] but the answer is so simple and they're
[50:33] looking
[50:33] all over it
[50:39] the world is just looking all over the
[50:42] real answer
[50:43] people are hoping this you know the
[50:46] healed commercials
[50:48] they always like to say we are in this
[50:50] together
[50:53] we are in this together
[50:57] yeah partially you are right
[51:00] but what are you looking to
[51:05] what are you looking to to give us
[51:08] to get everybody to answer
[51:13] because some medicine may help some may
[51:16] they might kill another
[51:20] but god gave us a pill
[51:26] and if you take this gospel
[51:30] it will heal everything
[51:36] not only your sickness but it'll heal
[51:39] broken hearts
[51:41] it'll deliver you from any habits
[51:45] it can give you new life again
[51:50] oh if the people only will try him
[51:56] i'm not talking about just going to a
[51:58] church and getting a religion
[52:01] that's not what i'm talking about
[52:03] because the bible said
[52:04] they have a form of godliness
[52:08] but denying the power thereof
[52:12] we have enough forms
[52:16] we've had enough reforms
[52:20] yet the people are not even saved
[52:26] there's a song my sister used to sing
[52:29] jesus is the answer for the world today
[52:35] why won't as brother earnest you say
[52:37] that you know
[52:38] what is it about jesus they don't like
[52:44] what's the matter with him
[52:48] a man who uh or can be touched
[52:51] by the feeling of your infirmity
[52:56] a man that came only to do that which
[52:59] was
[53:00] right and good
[53:03] yet they didn't want to have nothing to
[53:06] do with
[53:06] it
[53:10] they want to barabbas
[53:14] they wanted to kill somebody that had no
[53:16] sin
[53:20] and there still is a situation even
[53:22] today
[53:26] let me talk a little bit for our clothes
[53:31] in first samuel
[53:35] your day of battle
[53:39] is here
[53:44] wait no longer you are right in the
[53:47] midst of it
[53:53] who knew
[53:58] that this day will come like this
[54:05] that left us
[54:10] in a crisis
[54:15] life has never been on earth in a long
[54:17] time be just saying
[54:19] in a hundred years as we have had
[54:22] disaster before the hugo
[54:24] and uh you know the storms and
[54:27] all kind of other uh disease that that
[54:30] ever hit
[54:31] you know but never like this
[54:39] country in a recession
[54:44] we know that we're living off
[54:48] of borrowed money
[54:52] yet they are giving out trillions
[54:58] nobody even asking the question well
[55:00] where is it coming from
[55:05] they're just enjoying the stimulus
[55:12] but there is something behind it
[55:16] we're really going to feel the effect
[55:21] and we are gonna uh have to
[55:24] deal with what is gonna happen here on
[55:27] this earth
[55:30] i was telling the family of the night
[55:33] that we were saying one time about this
[55:35] world system
[55:38] that has been orchestrated
[55:42] set up by the devil himself
[55:47] i'm not calling no man or the devil
[55:50] but satan himself if you notice in the
[55:53] bible
[55:54] when he took jesus on this high temple
[55:58] he told him that all this i'll give you
[56:01] he showed him all the kingdoms of the
[56:04] world
[56:05] and he was tipped into i'll give it to
[56:08] you
[56:09] if you would just only bow down and
[56:12] worship me
[56:16] so he is the mastermind behind this
[56:18] system
[56:21] he is the mastermind behind what you see
[56:24] going on see
[56:26] because from the very beginning he
[56:28] already has said that
[56:30] how he was going to exalt his throne
[56:33] above the most high god in other words
[56:37] he was going to be a god
[56:42] and he has anointed people
[56:46] that have took on this very image that
[56:50] we can create
[56:54] we don't even know whether there is a
[56:56] god where is the act
[57:00] and they begin to boast that we are the
[57:02] gods
[57:06] we are the intelligent people of this
[57:08] earth
[57:11] that's why we can control it like we are
[57:16] failing to realize that's the same
[57:19] spirit that was on lucifer
[57:23] i will exalt my throne
[57:26] i will be like the most high god
[57:30] i or i
[57:34] not even know that
[57:37] god is the only creator
[57:43] without god you can't do
[57:46] nothing that's why it behooves you and i
[57:52] i was just saying the night too that you
[57:55] know i believe that
[57:57] what we uh uh have done is
[58:00] we have been looking somewhere else
[58:05] and still looking to the real source
[58:10] we've been going to church and we've
[58:12] been hearing
[58:13] good sermons and we have some of the
[58:17] best preachers
[58:18] ever there is in the world nowadays
[58:22] i was telling somebody that we pretty
[58:24] much were have done preach
[58:26] preach preach out
[58:29] and the harder we preach the worse of
[58:32] the people lives get
[58:36] we got more churches than anything
[58:39] we got more preachers than anything
[58:43] but then where is deliverance
[58:47] where is god at
[58:50] surely if that if we are preaching what
[58:54] jesus preached surely the word
[58:57] jesus preached people got delivered
[59:06] but look at us
[59:10] churches have failed
[59:14] because they can't produce the real god
[59:18] they've sent them to the seminary and
[59:22] they've got big degrees and
[59:25] no lord have earth they are more
[59:27] eloquent than ever
[59:31] better bible students than we ever had
[59:33] before
[59:36] but look what it is producing
[59:41] it's only giving the people a false
[59:44] security
[59:47] they are not getting to the real source
[59:52] door they go into a building structure
[59:57] but that's not the real source
[1:00:01] the servant of god said i i believe he
[1:00:03] believed what happened was that
[1:00:05] we getting them to come to church that's
[1:00:07] good but
[1:00:08] we are not getting them to jesus christ
[1:00:14] i believe sometime that we need to back
[1:00:17] up
[1:00:20] i believe that even as ministers we have
[1:00:22] to re-examine ourselves
[1:00:26] and take note of the people lies
[1:00:29] and let's be honest with ourselves
[1:00:33] are the people really getting the
[1:00:36] substance that they need from god
[1:00:40] or their life being really converted
[1:00:43] or are they being reformed
[1:00:48] god's not looking for reformers
[1:00:52] god look for transformers
[1:00:56] he wants to transform your life
[1:01:01] he wants to root out that old
[1:01:04] nature that we've been born with and
[1:01:07] give you a nature like his
[1:01:12] until the church until the preachers
[1:01:16] come back to that kind of gospel
[1:01:20] we only gonna have reforms
[1:01:25] we have rehabilitation centers
[1:01:30] like they have in the natural we
[1:01:32] rehabilitate
[1:01:33] they do good for a season
[1:01:37] they do good they get dry for a couple
[1:01:39] of months i heard
[1:01:40] they make they confess you know i've
[1:01:42] been driving down for so many months
[1:01:45] that's good but have you got anything in
[1:01:47] you
[1:01:49] because the bible said when that spirit
[1:01:51] leaves for a season
[1:01:52] he comes back and says oh this my house
[1:01:56] i used to live in
[1:01:59] see it's good to get dried out but you
[1:02:02] got to get
[1:02:03] something in you something that's gonna
[1:02:07] keep you even when that spirit tried to
[1:02:10] come back
[1:02:11] he recognized somebody else living in my
[1:02:14] house now
[1:02:17] and it got to be the holy ghost
[1:02:21] let's not i've been saying let's not
[1:02:23] fool ourselves
[1:02:26] let's stop playing church let's stop
[1:02:30] acting like we got it let's be honest
[1:02:35] and say lord here am i
[1:02:38] i thought i had this lord but i want to
[1:02:42] be
[1:02:42] certain of god
[1:02:46] i don't want to just wonder about it i
[1:02:48] don't want to feel
[1:02:49] like it but i want to know that you are
[1:02:52] here
[1:02:54] you've got to know
[1:02:58] david i'm reminded i'm closing david
[1:03:02] when he was fighting
[1:03:06] getting ready to go to battle with
[1:03:07] goliath
[1:03:12] and he heard that philistine make
[1:03:15] a statement against god's people
[1:03:18] david couldn't take that sup
[1:03:22] mean david start bubbling i can
[1:03:25] understand
[1:03:27] you know when you hear the devil
[1:03:28] boasting
[1:03:30] what he gonna do you ain't gonna
[1:03:34] make it and you're gonna die and
[1:03:37] making these bold statements
[1:03:40] david said you mean to tell me
[1:03:43] you let this uncircumcised
[1:03:47] philistine defile the armies of god
[1:03:52] david said no no no no i can't take this
[1:03:58] david say let me fight him
[1:04:03] daddy was a little rudy little boy
[1:04:06] didn't look like nothing he was a giant
[1:04:10] nine foot that giant could have picked
[1:04:14] david up with one of his
[1:04:15] through his finger shoot
[1:04:18] kill him but david giant
[1:04:22] i like in uh you say durham daddy was
[1:04:25] not afraid
[1:04:28] david didn't look at the size of the
[1:04:30] giant
[1:04:31] david said i'm gonna take your head off
[1:04:36] oh what what kind of faith david had
[1:04:40] see that's real faith
[1:04:44] saying david just had faith because
[1:04:46] david
[1:04:47] had had experiences on the backside of
[1:04:50] the mountain
[1:04:52] that's what we need we need people
[1:04:55] that had experience with god
[1:05:01] trained by the holy ghost david kept the
[1:05:05] sheep
[1:05:06] and david knew that he was responsible
[1:05:10] for those sheep and they would say no
[1:05:14] that would bear come and took him david
[1:05:16] said i went
[1:05:17] out and i slew him so when david saw
[1:05:21] this giant
[1:05:22] himself here's another bear
[1:05:26] a god that did this god can take him too
[1:05:32] that god that destroyed those devils in
[1:05:35] your life
[1:05:36] 10 15 years ago is the same god
[1:05:39] that's with you tonight that
[1:05:43] sickness you had you know i said you had
[1:05:50] because it got to go when you understand
[1:05:53] who you are
[1:05:57] the problem i believe to serve god's
[1:05:58] saying that what happened is
[1:06:00] that people haven't had an experience
[1:06:02] yet
[1:06:05] seeker your experience gives you faith
[1:06:09] and they say it put hair on your chest
[1:06:13] it makes your muscles come on when
[1:06:16] things happen
[1:06:17] you say oh another devil
[1:06:21] you say i saw you somewhere else too but
[1:06:24] you read another phone but i'm gonna
[1:06:26] take your head off
[1:06:28] david on brothers had no confidence in
[1:06:31] him
[1:06:31] saul tried to put all kind of
[1:06:34] ecclesiastical
[1:06:35] things on david you know a shield and
[1:06:38] david said come on
[1:06:39] so i can't fight like this
[1:06:43] come on david laid aside every week
[1:06:47] you can't fight the devil with sin in
[1:06:49] your life
[1:06:50] you got to lay aside every week
[1:06:55] then you ready to fight goliath
[1:06:58] david stood there and that goliath made
[1:07:02] his voice and david just sat there
[1:07:04] listening to him and david had those
[1:07:08] five smooth stones in his bag
[1:07:12] oh church what is in your bag
[1:07:17] what is in your heart
[1:07:21] see the word got to be in
[1:07:24] us because we are in the day of battle
[1:07:30] you've been giving the most powerful
[1:07:34] thing that god ever could give his
[1:07:37] soldiers
[1:07:38] and that's the revealed word for your
[1:07:40] hour
[1:07:42] no ecclesiastical denominational word
[1:07:45] can stand up against goliath you need a
[1:07:48] supernatural word
[1:07:52] you need more than just uh or
[1:07:54] educational
[1:07:56] standards and morals teaching that
[1:07:59] they're teaching these largest
[1:08:01] you need the voice of god
[1:08:07] pray tonight as we close
[1:08:12] arm yourself
[1:08:16] with the word
[1:08:19] telling the saints there
[1:08:24] nothing else you do is going to be able
[1:08:27] to stand against the wiles of the devil
[1:08:29] but the word
[1:08:32] take the word by faith
[1:08:36] cut your way through
[1:08:39] cut that depressing demon
[1:08:43] cut that nicotine and
[1:08:47] uh draw a demon away from you
[1:08:55] i challenge you tonight
[1:09:00] take the word apply it to your life
[1:09:05] and watch what god will do don't be
[1:09:08] afraid don't
[1:09:09] faint because you outnumbered
[1:09:12] don't think because the giant might be
