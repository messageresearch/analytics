jesus christ's name amen and amen have your bibles you turn with us if you will to the book of second corinthians the third chapter one through six not meaning to be long at all tonight i just feel a little tiresome but amen we just pray tonight amen that we can just move amen out of the flesh you man second corinthians 3 1-6 it reads do we begin again to commend ourselves our need we as some others epistles of commendation to you all letters of accommodation from you yeah our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through christ to god's word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also had made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit give life let us pray father we thank you for your word tonight god may you list have preeminence in jesus name amen amen may be seated i want to use for a thought tonight a living written epistle a living written epistle i was reading of the morning and the quote of the day it had something in it that really um opened my eyes to what god is really looking for in this age and it came out of the message of influence and he said it like this remember the bible said you are living written epistles red of all men now many people won't read the bible but god has made you a living representation you are a walking letter should be a walking bible christ in you you should be the walking word of god and if you profess to be a christian and not that your influence what you're influencing will make you have to answer for many souls that day you have turned aside away from christ and as i was looking you know at that and one of my favorite scriptures that i read in romans a lot of times about presenting your body as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and i understand that god's life that he gave for us it was a sacrifice life because he didn't have to do it but he did it for us why would he do such a thing for somebody that didn't even recognize that he was their god you know it looked like that god being a great creator we ought to know that we had to come from somewhere by somebody but because of the amnesia that we had we [Music] just thought as evolution just teach it we just pop up from some sale somewhere but we had a creator and then his creator he had thoughts and you are the very thought of god not only that the bible that was written it was really expressing what god was thinking about us and that how that our life should be a living written epistle it's not uh the problem we're having is not with so much our clothing and our outward appearance is the life christian when you are professing to be a christian you're professing that the life of god in you and though the people don't understanding they will have to give an account what they they're doing with the life that god gave them because we think that we just do what we want because we our own boss but that's not true if i want to say we've been brought with our price and we are not our own go with me to scripture there and suck second corinthians also six six and sixteen six and sixteen and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people god is saying here that you are the living temple of god when you receive the holy ghost you become the living word for the day that you are living in there are things written of us that our life is supposed to manifest and the only way that we can do it is through the power of the holy ghost uh distilling reminding of uh brother ernest preaching about two masters because it's a great conflict it's a great struggle that people are are trying to live uh two different lives that's a scripturophenic god don't want scriptural phoenix god is looking for uh us to yield ourself to him and become a living sacrifice a living temple where god can dwell in it's important that that god gets in us because we have been settling with him with feeling him and him just coming on us and after a few days it wear off but god wants to abide forever he wants to rule he wants to be your god and if he can ever have that preeminence in in us see then we begin to yield ourself that lord not my will but let thy will no more what jeremiah want to do lord cause when i do that i make a mess i can't even keep my own self i need god to to be in me so that uh whatever that i'm doing even some time when when we get off the path god has to correct us i thought about something earlier and i had a incident you know a lot of times i don't talk about things a lot and you know my wife always said i learned more about you across the pulpit you know because we just don't tell you know say everything but the other day i was coming home off um monticello road and i don't know what name i wrote i'd turn off on but anyhow as i was coming you know and i was just thinking you know about something about the lord and i was coming and all of a sudden as i was driving you know uh i was coming up to this curve and i was facing a 18-wheeler and then this other car went around the 18-wheeler and so here i am now facing a head-on and i said to myself i have to make a decision what i'm going to do here there was a church on the right the 18 wheeler was in his lane the car was in my lane head on and i said lord and i quickly pulled those able to pull over to the shoulder in front of the church there and i just sat there for a few minutes and i said you know sometimes we have to make decisions quickly and hoping that the decision you made was the right one and i look at it you know and saying that lord you know we don't know when and how we have to leave here but if i have to go then let me be right let my life be right with you because i would hate to have to leave any other way you know and sometimes we we look at ourselves and uh what how righteous we are but our righteousness is really of god and if that life has been transformed to into the into god's image and then you have eternal life and so i see the importance you know for of christians to to to really understand that you know you got to be born again that life that that god wants to the well you know and god wants to be in us more than we want it he just say let me in let me have control i've been knocking but you you let me uh just be a savior but i want to be your god i want to be your lord see i want to direct you i want to show you that what i can take and do for you because it's all about what he's already done for us our reading and i heard so i'm going to say you know what did they say that but we'll try to uh make god come to our standard but we got to come to god's standard we try to program god the lord now i want you to do this and lord i won't you do that but no no no no lord what do you have me to do nevertheless what yeah i might have plans lord but never lie about that whatever you have for me cause something we planning we don't know what we be planning so that's why we need god we need that life we need that reality that as but someone's saying that i know he's there and if he's really there then then he'll keep you he'll teach you as i look at it he'll be your protector he'll be your shield you know he'll be uh everything to you because we understand that life here you know it's it's unpredictable things that happen beyond our control sometimes catch us by surprise catch us unaware and sometimes it really hurts the things that we have to you know deal with and go through here and sometimes if you don't really have god there you know in you you won't be able to stand against it that's why you know that uh i'll be the scripture to say that when the enemy comes in like a flood he said the spirit of the law will raise up a standard against it see that's why we need that living reality now talking about written epistles you are supposed to be a we are supposed to be the living manifested word fire were they we got a portion that god has allowed it just like in every age they had uh a portion of the word that they were supposed to manifest in the generation that they live then and every age had that and we have it but no other age has uh the fullness of the word like like we have it and you know when much is given much is required in other words it's like a child that's growing up you won't give them much responsibility because they are not mature enough to handle it so you just give them a little simple you know and god does this as we grow and as we mature spiritually speaking god then begin to acquire more at us we no longer can use that excuse i don't know what i'm doing you know but now it's rather not you're going to obey god you're going to let god have the preeminence in your life and that's the what god really looking for he wants preeminence because god wants to use you for whatever he has for you to do and the very word that has been spoken you know and as i i understand you know as you know the servant of god was preaching and teaching you know things and you know it's so strange that uh that the people that are supposed to understand the word uh it's like they're missing the real reason of uh a malachi full ministry and what the purpose is you know it's not just to make us excited that's all right in the shout and that's all right you know but to live the word to manifest it that you in the world become one and that when people see you then they're seeing uh the living reality of god life displaying in you that you become god's mouth when they see you they see god because many people never go to church that's why the life that we live not just in church but more so out in your workplace in your school place wherever you go that life of god should be uh um just pouring out it should be such a reflection that when people come in your presence they'll say excuse me um there's something about you you know it's not what about you but it's that your life has been transformed by god by the holy ghost and you now become a living reality of god making himself manifest in flesh again i got two or three things that i i want to just read but you know as i'm been telling you know speaking to people you know now and i understand that uh the the best sermon even any preacher can preach is the one that he can live i believe it was a man one time that uh was asking uh um alabama used a little scripture about a man who went to church and uh he got saved and this preacher wanted to know what sermon it was you know that he preached you know that caused him to get saved it was it a certain song he said no he said what it did said that he said no he said but it was a lady that lived such a humble life and he got thirsty of what she had you know and i think that's real is true you know that you know you we can't make ourself that but if we can yield ourselves to god and let god you know have the preeminence and and empty out you know this stuff that's that's in us get rid of us and and let god have control because as long as you're in the way god can have the preeminence here he said now what it is you are written epistles the bible said now what is in a pistol is a written word and you are written in other words you read it like this you it is your written epistle or you are the word that has been written made manifest what was spoken by i was serving this hour you know there is a people lies that's going to manifest that it's not going to just be a label we call ourself message but it's going to be a manifestation of your life that the word has transformed you into the very things that he spoke see because just saying i'm in the message you know we use that as a sometimes a compound to be identified with a prophet i'll be identified with a you know a certain church affiliation but until our life has been transformed into the very image of god we missed it but god is requiring we will say that god is looking for perfection not our perfect but his perfection but i realized that you know it takes a sacrifice it takes a people that's that understand that uh you know sometimes you know i think that we too loose you know we just we were always like that we used to be more conscientious about the presence of god and and what we would say you know we had a little more i don't know uh consecrated about ourselves that even the way we came to church we were more reverent understanding that we coming to hear from god i believe our minds were in a different mode than what it is now we came with an expectation we came looking for god to do something and god met us but it was our mind-setting but something happened i believe paul said you did run well but what hindered you you know what hinder us we did we hinder ourselves we are our worst enemy but we got to understand that sometimes we got to stop and shake ourselves and understand you know what am i here for what did i come to do what am i doing with the life that god gave me am i really manifesting the word for my hour are we just going through the lot of motions he says you are written epistle you are the word that has been written made manifested nothing can be added to it you can't say i'm a written epistle and living some other kind of a life but what this had already wrote and he was given an example you know what not i wanted a brother i'm not going to get into that but he was given this example you know i had a brother that was trying to hang him up you know on something and he kind of just uh you know was aware of what they were trying to do so he kind of just you know got out of it and brought something to them you know what not but uh i believe that more so as we coming to the closing you know of the hour and we see that uh the great falling of way of people just dropping off and going backwards and being so unconcerned about their christian walk we realized that you know uh that we can allow that you've got to do something i got to do something i can't wait on on on the preacher you say come on y'all come on y'all come on by now you ought to be more concerned about your own soul salvation the bible says encourage your own self not wait to somebody the next preacher or the next tent me they may not be anymore we've got to learn now you've got to know how to stir up that with is in you you've got to understand that if your fire is going out put wood on it oh what that what you would do if it was winter time and you tell them you freezing and you sit in front of a fight that's been dying out you got the wood there and everything to go on it and you sit there and say i'm getting cold then grab the wood put it on the fire grab the word put it on your fire get stirred again don't wait to end about it you do it that's a lot of time that we wait we what are we waiting on who are we waiting on we've had preachers from all over the world you know no doubt we should have been gone by now but we're still here being that it must be isn't quite ready yet and i believe that's why the bible said be ye ready god trying with all that he has given us and everything that has been hidden from time past he has revealed it he's made known to us how to prepare ourselves for the rapture and i'll be viewing revelation his bride has made herself she didn't wait on anybody no she knew she had all the things to get ready so she made herself ready that's what we got to do make you like you do for work who wakes you up nobody don't believe this thing get up get up get up you set that clock what do you do you made yourself ready you prepare yourself for whatever it is that you need to do the way you can get to that job properly and on time and if you can do that for a natural job how much more we ought to do for god yes it's time to prepare i want to tell you something if you're not preparing for the things of god are you preparing for something else and no doubt i know no one wants to be left behind and give it a close he said now when you go to a trial to be a witness you are testifying for somebody see and jesus said the scriptures are the script they that bear record of me then he was god's word expressed in human flesh jesus was he was the very written word in flesh it was already written of him in the book and he came to manifest that which was written he said they didn't bear record of me then he was god's word expressed god promised made flesh to express itself that's what christ was the word of god expressed in human form the word of god expressed in human form and that's what god is looking for even today he looking for the word of god to be expressed in who in you and i you will be the very expression of what's been written in the bible not just the message the message the message that's letter and as paul said it not tables of a letter but of the spirit he said now that's the reason christian i think is so real tonight so that we should live the right kind of a life because as many people won't take time to read the bible but they'll read you and see they'll read you see you are a written epistle of god a real true born-again christian is the word expressed again because you're written epistles of god of all men what type of person should we to be if we know that our lives is a open living bible my it shall make us caution of our own confession and that we confess something and don't and don't possess it and if we don't have it then we need to get really to the altar begin to cry out lord help me to become the very living word expressed in this day i believe that is is the cry you know uh there seemed uh a time past that the uh a settling down time now is i believe for every one of us as the bible says to examine ourselves and see where we really act whether we just going to church or whether we were really getting a hold of god like we ought to or whether we just going through the motions of it because god he's looking for you and i in this thing to be the very word written in in human form again the word made flesh in you in me and when people see our lives then it said dear christians why because they see the life of god made manifest again how many of you really want that tonight amen you want your life to be the living expressed image of god lord help me to be the living word tonight wherever i go lord let me uh understand that my life is displaying something what are the people reading lord help us god bless you tonight you we're written epistles amen thank god tonight for the word for every day that we live somebody's reading the book the book that you're writing god's servant said in that day even your thoughts will speak louder than your words said it would be like a big screen and your life can play out before you you couldn't lie to the screen so you'll realize the book that you're writing examine because at this particular time you have an opportunity to get it right [Music] he said your sins and iniquities will i remember no more said confess your faults amen he that confesses and forsakens god would have mercy so by the grace of god
