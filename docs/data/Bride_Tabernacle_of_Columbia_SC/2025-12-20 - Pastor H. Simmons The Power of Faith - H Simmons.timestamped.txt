[29:18] In Jesus name,

[29:26] God. Peace of God that compasses all
[29:29] knowledge and understanding.
[29:31] Father, we ask you to move here today.

[29:37] minds, touch the Marie families. Lord,
[29:42] it must be mighty difficult today, Lord.

[30:28] Oh God will let your blood cover Lord.
[30:32] Bless here the service tonight. Bless

[30:41] Mark 11:22.
[30:48] We was talking about the key to the door
[30:51] is faith. Amen.
[30:54] And we said that prophet God said he
[30:57] lost the key. Amen. The church has lost
[31:00] the key. Amen.
[31:03] So
[31:04] Jude writing that you earnestly contend,
[31:08] fight for it, contend for the faith that
[31:11] was once delivered into the saints. I
[31:14] believe is if he can say it then, I
[31:16] believe even more so now that we can
[31:18] say, "Let us earnestly contend for the
[31:22] faith that was once to live it to the
[31:24] saints."
[31:25] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "We got to
[31:27] bring him up out of history and we
[31:29] [snorts] got to bring him on the scene."
[31:32] Amen.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen.
[31:38] Mark 11:22.
[31:41] And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[31:44] "What?
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God."
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Y'all, you can be seated.
[31:50] Have faith in God.
[31:52] If
[31:55] now we understand that faith is the
[31:57] substance of things hoped for and it's
[31:59] the evidence of things not seen.
[32:03] Amen. There was a sermon preached faith
[32:05] the six sense. I think Dr. Kenan and
[32:08] different ones talked about the six
[32:11] sense. Amen.
[32:14] And we
[32:16] heard FF Bodsworth and different ones
[32:18] talk about the six sense. those that had
[32:23] great healing campaigns.
[32:25] Amen. And got move in the Smith weather
[32:29] works and all of those different ones.
[32:33] Amen.
[32:35] And Fenny and talked a lot about prayer
[32:40] and faith. Amen.
[32:43] So there was always those that are
[32:44] oldtime preachers and that spent hours
[32:49] and hours in prayer seeking God.
[32:53] Amen. For the will of God and for you
[32:57] know it takes time to really get with
[32:59] God.
[33:00] And we want to talk about the power of
[33:03] faith.
[33:04] Amen. Faith has power.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Power. Amen.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; And you think about faith. Amen. By
[33:13] faith we understand that the worlds were
[33:16] framed by the word of God. Amen.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; So
[33:22] hallelujah.
[33:24] Let me just say faith come by what?
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Hearing
[33:28] &gt;&gt; and hearing what?
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can base your confidence.
[33:33] You can put your faith in the word and
[33:36] if the word said it the Amen. God God is
[33:39] always you can be assure.
[33:43] Amen. The word of God Amen would
[33:45] accomplish
[33:47] &gt;&gt; what God said it to do.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever God said a word would do,
[33:52] it'll do it.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Because it's God word. It's not man
[33:56] word. It's God word.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us, Amen. Because he
[34:00] can swear by no greater he swear by
[34:03] himself.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:06] by two uh immutable things. Amen.

[53:48] not hinder because God said I give you
[53:51] the land. Are you with me? So all that
[53:55] you see, all that you feel.
[53:59] Amen. All that you can imagine, all that
[54:02] you affection, conscience, memory, all
[54:05] of that.
[54:07] You're not looking at that. You're
[54:08] looking at the word and you having faith
[54:11] in what God said about it and what God
[54:15] said about it. That's what you anchor
[54:17] your faith in. The word says mine. If I
[54:21] say to the mountain, I've said, praise
[54:25] God. [snorts] And you shall have
[54:28] whatsoever you say. Right? Therefore,
[54:31] 24th verse, therefore I say unto you,
[54:34] what thingsoever ye what?
[54:38] Amen. [snorts]
[54:41] God, if you a man ways please the Lord,
[54:46] he'll give you the desires of your
[54:48] heart. Are you with me?
[54:52] He said, if you abide in me and my word,
[54:56] what you
[54:57] &gt;&gt; then you can what?
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Ask what you will and I'll do what?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; I'll do it.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; I'll do it. Do you believe that? Amen.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; You can ask and God will do it.
[55:08] What if you asking and don't believe it?
[55:12] Do you want God to do it?
[55:15] Would you still Well, I I asked and
[55:18] nothing happened.
[55:21] Did you ask a miss?
[55:23] Did you believe
[55:26] and not doubt in your heart?
[55:29] If you believed and didn't doubt in your
[55:31] heart,
[55:33] praise God.
[55:35] What if you asking God to do something
[55:38] and it and it's not according to his
[55:41] word.
[55:43] Amen. And you're asking God to do it and
[55:47] you're not willing to do what God asks
[55:49] you to do.
[55:51] He said, "If you love me, what?"
[55:55] &gt;&gt; If you love God, you ought to obey God.
[55:58] Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He told the Sonician woman, he
[56:02] said,
[56:04] "You asking me to give you the children
[56:06] bread." And he said, "It's not meat for
[56:09] me to give the children bread to the
[56:10] what?
[56:11] &gt;&gt; To the dogs." Isn't that right? So,
[56:14] actually, amen. You're asking for
[56:16] something that you don't deserve.
[56:19] Are you with me? Because this is the
[56:22] children's bread. Healing is the
[56:23] children bread. Isn't that right?
[56:26] &gt;&gt; And you ask for it. Amen. But you're not
[56:29] willing to be a child child of God. But
[56:32] the woman, Amen, was not offended.
[56:37] Somebody call you a dog, you wouldn't be
[56:39] back to church.
[56:41] But the woman was not offended. Why?
[56:45] Because she knew she had come to the
[56:47] right person and she knew that he had
[56:50] what he she needed.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[56:55] And sometime people are offended easy
[56:59] and they give up. Okay.
[57:02] Well, it ain't. You say I can't have it.
[57:06] And God say you can't have it.
[57:09] Are you with me? Because Amen. Cuz
[57:11] you're a dog.
[57:15] Are you with me?
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Huh? God called that woman a dog. Y'all
[57:20] hear what Jesus call a woman a dog.
[57:23] No, you won't be. The Gentiles and the
[57:27] Jews,
[57:29] they were called unclean.
[57:33] They were called dogs.
[57:36] Amen.
[57:38] And we all
[57:40] had our conversation in time past
[57:43] and we were sinners.
[57:47] The Bible tells us we were alienated
[57:49] from the commonwealth and strangers of
[57:50] the covenant of promise.
[57:53] Are you with me? The promise of God
[57:56] wasn't to us. It was to God's children,
[57:59] the Jews, the Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; But God has extended his blessings
[58:05] toward the Gentiles also.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Because we are Abraham's seed by faith.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And by faith, we're children of
[58:15] Abraham. That Abraham was before. Amen.
[58:18] The law.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] And we're Abraham's seed through faith.
[58:27] Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I don't want to go too
[58:32] much get too much. I said I was going to
[58:34] be real short tonight and I done went
[58:36] too long already.
[58:39] But let me get to this last this part
[58:41] here. I wanted to get down to the part
[58:44] where we was going on forgiveness, but I
[58:48] I I jumped up ahead anyway. But it says,
[58:52] "Therefore I say unto you, what things
[58:55] soever you desire when you pray, believe
[58:58] you what?"
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Receive. [snorts]
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Believe you what?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, how can you receive something
[59:06] and you you don't see it?

[59:13] how can you re receive something you
[59:15] don't see?
[59:20] Huh?
[59:21] &gt;&gt; You don't know. Now, how can you receive
[59:24] something, Moses? You don't see
[59:32] receiving what you don't see. Mary,
[59:35] would you like to have it what you can't
[59:37] see? But how can you get it?
[59:44] &gt;&gt; You have faith in it. You don't see it.
[59:49] But how you how you how you gonna
[59:52] receive it when you don't see it.
[1:00:00] You said the right thing, but you got a
[1:00:01] stick. You got an ankle. You can't be
[1:00:04] shaking now, man. You You got to stand
[1:00:07] down. You don't let nobody SHAKE YOU.
[1:00:08] THE DEVIL shakes you if he can. But if
[1:00:12] you believe that you received it and you
[1:00:14] got faith in it, THEN YOU DON'T DOUBT
[1:00:16] IT. YOU JUST stand there.
[1:00:19] You don't have to shake.
[1:00:22] You got faith. And faith is the what?
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Faith is the victory. Faith is the
[1:00:28] substance of things. What?
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; And then what?
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; You got to say, Jo, you known the next

[1:02:02] want it.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Faith is believing that you have it
[1:02:09] without seeing it.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; You don't have to see it to believe it.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Faith says it's mine and I got it

[1:10:43] Hallelujah. How many believe that
[1:10:45] tonight? But you got to have faith.
[1:10:47] Amen. Have faith in God. Let us bow our
[1:10:50] heads tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:10:53] just thank you for your word, Lord,
[1:10:54] tonight. Lord, that you spoke to us
[1:10:57] through the man of God, Lord. And oh,
[1:10:59] about having faith, Lord, in you, Lord.
[1:11:02] We just pray, oh God, as the word went
[1:11:04] out like a seed, Lord. I pray, God, that
[1:11:06] it fell on good ground. Pray, oh God,
[1:11:08] that those that are here and those that
[1:11:10] are listening in, God, that they could
[1:11:12] grab something, Lord. And oh Lord, it
[1:11:14] might begin to grow in their life, God,
[1:11:16] we thank you, Lord. We pray, oh God,
[1:11:19] that you would be with us, Lord, and be
[1:11:21] with the ministry, Lord, as we depart
[1:11:22] this place for never your presence and
[1:11:25] pray that the word don't slip. But God,
[1:11:27] I pray, oh Lord, that we might be able
[1:11:29] to hold on to it, ponder on it deep
[1:11:31] within our hearts. Lord, we thank you.
[1:11:34] We love you and we appreciate you for
[1:11:36] all of your grace towards us. In the
[1:11:38] name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Let the
[1:11:40] church say amen.
