[43:20] book of first john 4.
[43:24] first john 4.
[43:30] it says
[43:32] and one it says
[43:34] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[43:37] the spirits
[43:39] whether they be of god because many
[43:42] false
[43:43] prophets are going out into the world
[43:45] hereby know ye the spirit of god
[43:48] every spirit that confesses that jesus
[43:51] christ is
[43:53] coming the flesh is of god
[43:56] and every spirit that confesses not that
[43:59] jesus christ is come in the flesh is not
[44:03] of god
[44:04] and this is the spirit of antichrist
[44:08] whereby
[44:09] whereof
[44:10] ye have heard
[44:12] that it should come
[44:14] and
[44:15] even
[44:16] now already is in the world
[44:20] together
[44:21] ye of god little children and have
[44:24] overcome them because greater is he that
[44:28] is in you
[44:29] than he that is in the world god bless
[44:32] you towards you may be seated
[44:35] thank god this morning
[44:38] greater is he that is in you
[44:41] praise god that
[44:43] you know
[44:45] it just
[44:46] was in prayer yesterday and i just had
[44:50] another message that i thought i was
[44:52] going to bring
[44:54] concerning the glory of the lord amen
[44:57] and we realized that
[45:00] amen in order to get god's glory back we
[45:03] know that the glory god sometimes is
[45:05] departed from the church but
[45:08] it's an individual thing it's not a
[45:10] church it's not a group it's an
[45:11] individual
[45:13] you know we can you can come to church
[45:15] and you can come and you can look for
[45:16] somebody else to bring something to you
[45:19] or for you
[45:20] amen but
[45:22] the only way you're going to have the
[45:23] glory the lord
[45:25] and i and i was looking back at israel
[45:27] and as the glory of the lord has
[45:29] departed and and um we find that um
[45:33] israel went out to battle against the
[45:34] philistines
[45:36] and um we find that when they went out
[45:38] to battle against the philistine
[45:40] uh we found that they were
[45:43] defeated they they had to run
[45:47] and then um that was
[45:49] uh they bought the ark of the covenant
[45:51] and and and the philistines got afraid
[45:53] they said oh the ark is here and the the
[45:56] the
[45:58] the ones that god delivered out of egypt
[46:01] they began to
[46:02] they began to get afraid
[46:05] but
[46:06] they took courage
[46:09] and they
[46:10] accidentally defeated israel
[46:13] but before the defeat of israel
[46:16] israel had some problems
[46:19] those that were buried now uh uh
[46:22] phineas and
[46:26] and his brother
[46:28] they
[46:30] they were carrying out
[46:32] and they bought it back but they were
[46:34] actually taking bribes at the temple
[46:37] and they was lying with the women and
[46:39] all of that
[46:41] but yet it was taken off
[46:44] in the battle
[46:46] samuel's sons
[46:48] had hofner and finney hats
[46:50] they had forsaken the law i mean they
[46:52] weren't doing what right
[46:55] before the law
[46:57] yet they had the ark
[46:59] the ark was where israel where the word
[47:01] was and where god was where the glory of
[47:04] god was and amen they were to carry that
[47:07] out
[47:11] and sometimes he meant
[47:14] people can carry the word and carry it
[47:16] out
[47:18] but yet they mean their lives are off
[47:23] they're living any kind of way
[47:26] carrying them off
[47:30] but when they went out to battle they
[47:31] found out they couldn't win
[47:33] even though they had the heart
[47:35] even though the philistines are scared
[47:37] because they had to off
[47:42] and then
[47:43] next thing you know they were losing
[47:47] half nine fenney heist was killed
[47:52] one one fled back to samuel
[47:57] from the battle and told samuel
[48:00] samuel wanted to know how the battle
[48:02] going
[48:04] and he was telling them that we were
[48:05] being defeated and

[50:20] we're soldiers in the army of the lord
[50:22] and we're in a battle people need prayer
[50:26] people need you to be standing in the
[50:29] camp and crying out the lord

[51:05] things are happening to people
[51:08] and
[51:09] and yet it's no stir i don't want to
[51:11] call the people to pray i want the
[51:13] people to see the need of prayer
[51:16] amen i don't want to call the fast i
[51:18] want the people to see the need to fast
[51:21] you know you know you don't have to tell
[51:23] people what to do when they know what
[51:24] they need to do
[51:26] i wonder if god is talking to the people
[51:29] amen the condition that we are facing
[51:32] the things that are happening in our
[51:34] present tense world the things that are
[51:36] happening in our homes and our families
[51:38] the things that are happening we need to
[51:40] pray
[51:44] something all the stars lord let me let
[51:46] me let me not eat breakfast this morning
[51:48] let me pray about the situation lord i
[51:51] care
[51:53] i wonder do we really care about one
[51:55] another
[51:58] i i wonder
[52:00] we're really concerned about the
[52:01] atmosphere that we won't create in there
[52:04] we want to see god move i want to do we
[52:06] want
[52:07] you know and they said why
[52:09] why the glory not here why the presence
[52:11] not like it used to be because the
[52:14] people are not doing what they used to
[52:15] do
[52:20] i mean my wife was talking about that
[52:22] and i said i said be quiet
[52:27] i said because she was in the same
[52:30] channel and i
[52:31] and that she kind of felt a little bad
[52:33] because he thought i rebuking her i said
[52:36] i'm not review
[52:38] you know
[52:39] i understand
[52:41] that's the channel i'm you know the lord
[52:43] i said we always like that
[52:46] i said if you was a woman preacher i'd
[52:48] be glad to have you from my partner
[52:53] see because when the lord began to
[52:56] deal with us
[52:58] it
[53:00] god ought to be dealing with the people
[53:02] on the same basis and that's why you
[53:04] come for the witness
[53:07] you come to witness the presence of god
[53:09] the anointing of god the power of god in
[53:12] your midst if you come to church and
[53:14] you're not looking and expecting nothing
[53:16] you would get nothing
[53:18] but you come expecting god to move not
[53:21] just to speak to you amen but
[53:24] god i need your anointing i need your
[53:26] power i need your spirit i need you lord
[53:32] but is it coming a time when
[53:34] amen you come with something do you got
[53:36] you got something you want to give
[53:39] you got something that you want to give
[53:42] amen you got you you're bringing
[53:45] something with you
[53:46] praise god you're not just coming to
[53:48] collect and to receive i'm coming to
[53:51] give something
[53:52] amen because god gave me something to
[53:54] give
[53:55] amen you know i you know sometimes
[53:58] i see the preachers struggling in
[54:00] service and
[54:01] and they jumping and hollering and
[54:03] screaming and i don't know no presence
[54:06] no nothing
[54:07] and they're hollering loud they're
[54:09] saying good things
[54:10] no presence
[54:12] and i just sat there and i just started
[54:14] praying hard
[54:15] lord heaven
[54:17] lord do something lord send your
[54:18] anointing lord
[54:20] next thing you know the presence of god
[54:23] come in now
[54:24] you know you know that's what you do
[54:26] amen if if if if god is not if i'm not
[54:29] in the right channel all you got to do
[54:31] start praying god bless brother simon
[54:34] god help him god do something amen and
[54:37] then you'll experience god blessing amen
[54:39] the man of god with what you need
[54:42] but instead of doing that sometimes we
[54:45] have reservations now
[54:47] i wonder what he's going to say
[54:51] i ah
[54:51] heard that before
[54:53] instead of saying god bless them
[54:55] god get them in the right channel god i
[54:58] need something funny lord bless amen and
[55:01] then all of a sudden everything changed
[55:03] because you praying and you actually
[55:05] expecting something you want amen to
[55:07] people to be blessed you want to be
[55:09] blessed amen and you start praying
[55:14] and oftentimes we have to pray
[55:16] not saying my prayer made a difference
[55:18] but thank god it showed what the
[55:20] difference
[55:22] amen it could have been somebody else
[55:24] praying but one thing about it i didn't
[55:26] want to be guilty of sitting there not
[55:28] praying
[55:29] amen i wanted to be one praying lord
[55:32] bless the lord do something lord say
[55:34] something
[55:35] yeah yeah and that's what we do i say
[55:38] lord bless in jesus name lord help them
[55:41] in jesus name lord bless the word lord
[55:44] says
[55:45] speak to our hearts
[55:48] yes lord
[55:50] and this morning i you know i i i wasn't
[55:54] gonna say those things but the glory of
[55:56] the lord amen
[55:58] i want your glory lord
[56:00] i want you when you walk in the house of
[56:02] the lord that the glory of the lord will
[56:04] meet you
[56:06] amen there's the presence of the lord
[56:08] and it meets you but it takes some
[56:09] praying people it takes some people
[56:12] that's really going to make a sacrifice
[56:14] and i'm going to cry out to god and i'm
[56:16] going to see god move in my life and
[56:18] amen god i know you'll move for your
[56:20] people
[56:22] amen but some people that really believe
[56:24] god and really want to see a move of the
[56:27] holy ghost and the move of god and lord
[56:30] god in need to pray
[56:32] [Music]
[56:33] amen
[56:36] there's got to be somebody that's going
[56:38] to catch a whole amen if i don't do
[56:40] nothing about
[56:42] the situation ain't nothing going to be
[56:43] done
[56:45] if i just sat here amen and you know the
[56:48] the the the leopard scene and uh when
[56:52] the
[56:52] the camp was in
[56:55] the country was
[56:57] amen the enemy had
[56:59] like grasshoppers that covered the
[57:01] country and israelites it was in in
[57:04] battle and they were engulfed
[57:06] amen praise god surrounded by the enemy
[57:10] but those leopards amen
[57:13] they realized that they were going to
[57:14] start the death and they said well i
[57:16] said we're here till we die
[57:19] and you know what they did they went
[57:21] into the enemy camp
[57:23] and god had already did the job
[57:27] but if they would have sat there and god
[57:29] had already did they would have never
[57:31] knew
[57:32] amen but i want you to know amen that
[57:34] god can set your enemies in doubt he's
[57:37] just waiting on you not to shut down and
[57:39] die
[57:40] he waiting on you to make a move in the
[57:42] right direction
[57:44] amen they knew if i ever i'm going there
[57:47] in the enemy camp
[57:49] praise god i don't care for god i'm
[57:51] going because i sat here i'm going to
[57:53] die anyway
[57:56] praise god i'm going into the enemy camp
[57:59] but brother and sister we got to take
[58:01] courage this morning we got to take
[58:03] courage and amen praise god
[58:06] he that is in you
[58:08] amen then the greater is what
[58:12] he that is in
[58:14] he that is in me
[58:17] are you with me
[58:18] greater is he that is in
[58:21] me
[58:22] then he
[58:24] that is in the world
[58:26] amen how many believe that
[58:29] that he's greater
[58:32] than all amen he that is in the world
[58:36] you believe that this morning
[58:40] you know sometimes you we're not just
[58:42] trying to get you emotionally involved
[58:45] in the word but we're trying to get you
[58:47] to understand it meant the devil don't
[58:50] want you to move and don't want you to
[58:52] believe and the devil will stop your
[58:55] ears and stop your heart amen but
[58:57] somebody says well i'm in doubt
[59:00] i'm in doubt
[59:02] because
[59:04] i don't want to say something
[59:07] that is not there
[59:10] i don't want to say
[59:12] that he's in me
[59:13] when he not
[59:16] so i i can't go along with y'all
[59:19] and i can't say greater
[59:22] is he that's in me
[59:24] because he's not really in me
[59:27] so i have reservation
[59:30] about saying greater is he
[59:32] that's in me than he that is in the
[59:34] world when i don't have enough faith to
[59:37] believe that he's there
[59:40] my confidence is i don't know whether
[59:42] he's in me
[59:47] then there's others that said i don't
[59:48] want him in me
[59:53] the reason why i don't want him in me
[59:54] because
[59:56] greater is the world that's in
[59:58] me greater is the devil that's in me
[1:00:04] you see it's either one that's in you
[1:00:06] another
[1:00:09] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:00:11] is in the world or greater is the devil
[1:00:14] that's controlling me
[1:00:18] then god that wants
[1:00:21] you to welcome him in
[1:00:24] are you with me
[1:00:25] if you don't ever to invite him in he's
[1:00:28] not going to force himself on you
[1:00:31] you got to want him to come and welcome
[1:00:33] him
[1:00:35] lord i want you in
[1:00:38] and i want you to be the greater one how
[1:00:40] many won't you want him to be the
[1:00:42] greater one
[1:00:44] amen you don't want the world but you
[1:00:46] want him to be the greater one
[1:00:48] are you with me
[1:00:50] then you got to say i i i'm not going to
[1:00:53] sit here amen and die because i want the
[1:00:56] greater
[1:00:58] not the lesser but the greater
[1:01:01] i want jesus to be in me
[1:01:05] are you with me
[1:01:06] i want him there amen and i want to be
[1:01:09] able to say greater is he that is in me
[1:01:12] than he that is in the world
[1:01:14] i want to testify that i want to make it
[1:01:17] real
[1:01:19] you know i thought about play play
[1:01:20] church

[1:01:28] we play around like we really mean it
[1:01:30] and we don't really mean business with
[1:01:32] god that's play play church god is not
[1:01:35] moving in our lives because we are lying
[1:01:38] to ourselves
[1:01:40] we're not being honest with ourselves
[1:01:43] amen we're not really doing what we need
[1:01:46] to do amen to
[1:01:48] be able to testify greater is he that's
[1:01:51] in me
[1:01:54] praise god you got to trust god
[1:01:57] if you want him to be greater you got to
[1:01:59] trust him
[1:02:00] yes lord i trust you
[1:02:03] lord i believe in you
[1:02:07] lord i believe you real you my god you

[1:02:37] express himself and wants to show you
[1:02:39] his glory he wants to do exploits for
[1:02:41] you but he wants somebody that's willing
[1:02:44] to trust him and somebody that have
[1:02:46] enough confidence to believing
[1:02:49] that i'm god
[1:02:51] praise god and i'm a jealous god and i
[1:02:54] have no other god before me
[1:02:56] praise god i want you to know amen

[1:03:13] your will to be done in not mine god
[1:03:16] here i am
[1:03:18] i'm totally dependent on him
[1:03:21] amen praise god i'm not playing church
[1:03:23] i'm i'm not playing like i'm a christian
[1:03:26] i am i mean business amen i love god and
[1:03:29] i want to do his will i want to serve
[1:03:32] him i want him to
[1:03:33] oh god amen sometimes you see those
[1:03:36] hypocritical spirits those lying demons
[1:03:39] of folks that come around and play like
[1:03:42] they want god and no they don't love him
[1:03:44] and no they don't like him they met
[1:03:46] those spirits of the antichrist
[1:03:50] that's against the word
[1:03:54] jesus said something
[1:03:56] about loving him in the fifth chapter
[1:03:59] first john he says
[1:04:01] whosoever believeth that jesus
[1:04:04] christ is
[1:04:06] who
[1:04:07] whosoever
[1:04:09] believed that jesus is the christ is
[1:04:12] what
[1:04:14] born of god
[1:04:16] you know and and that's something about
[1:04:18] being born of god
[1:04:20] praise god it's no longer
[1:04:23] that you sat around with your proud
[1:04:25] spirit
[1:04:26] lifted up and thank you something when
[1:04:28] you're nothing
[1:04:30] oh god
[1:04:31] i said what's going on with you brother
[1:04:34] amen these spirits that's been binding
[1:04:37] people people been coming to church and
[1:04:39] don't even want god
[1:04:41] they may sat around and hindered the
[1:04:43] spirit
[1:04:44] sat around and hid the people from being
[1:04:46] blessed because they just come to church
[1:04:49] it's a traditional type thing we don't
[1:04:52] really mean that we want god we're just
[1:04:54] playing around we just come because
[1:04:57] that's the right thing to do pay my
[1:04:59] tithes and offerings amen that's all it
[1:05:01] is about ain't about that brother sister
[1:05:05] what do you give what you don't give
[1:05:07] praise god it's about whether or not
[1:05:09] you're going to be real with god
[1:05:11] whether or not you god's going
[1:05:13] whether or not you want the real god

[1:05:34] enough about me to die for my sins he
[1:05:37] cared enough about me to be whipped and
[1:05:39] spit on and i don't care nothing about
[1:05:41] him
[1:05:43] i don't care a thing about him because i
[1:05:46] don't believe in him
[1:05:49] i don't love him
[1:05:52] yet you want god to bless you and do
[1:05:54] things for you
[1:05:56] and yet you treat god any kind of way
[1:05:59] praise god
[1:06:01] sometimes i'm going to tell you
[1:06:02] something sometimes you turn a deaf ear
[1:06:05] to god and you curse your own self
[1:06:08] and then you want somebody to pray god
[1:06:10] or pray this
[1:06:12] demon from away from you and you doing
[1:06:15] god any kind of way not knowing that god

[1:11:34] sting and what i found out you know
[1:11:38] what i was studying and when i was right
[1:11:39] writing
[1:11:40] and and in prayer then i said let me let
[1:11:43] me go see what the prophecy
[1:11:45] you know
[1:11:46] find out we we don't want to call

[1:11:58] to me about the same word
[1:12:01] amen if it's the holy ghost it's gonna
[1:12:03] speak the same thing
[1:12:05] there ain't gonna be no
[1:12:06] division it's what we want we if we
[1:12:09] really want god
[1:12:11] see because a church is not a place you
[1:12:14] come and you don't want god
[1:12:17] church is the place to come to you that
[1:12:19] you really want god and you really want
[1:12:22] god to be a supernatural god
[1:12:25] a god of power a god of love a god that
[1:12:29] amen when you've got things going on in
[1:12:31] your life a god that can resolve the
[1:12:34] issues
[1:12:36] amen can give you peace can give you joy
[1:12:39] a god of love
[1:12:43] praise god you can be happy
[1:12:46] praise god you know a lot of people
[1:12:49] because they're not happy and they're
[1:12:51] missing out on something and they make
[1:12:53] they feel uh excluded then they go into
[1:12:56] the depression and oppression and all of
[1:12:58] that amen and they're looking for joy
[1:13:00] and they're looking for some type of
[1:13:02] peace they're looking for somebody to
[1:13:04] love them
[1:13:06] praise god they're looking for love in
[1:13:08] their own places because they don't
[1:13:10] understand they meant that what they
[1:13:12] need is god i'm looking for love and i
[1:13:16] can't find love so they reach out there
[1:13:19] ain't been looking for somebody to love
[1:13:21] him somebody to care about him
[1:13:24] praise god
[1:13:27] find out amen that that's not true love
[1:13:30] out there
[1:13:33] so people are caught up out there
[1:13:35] looking for love looking for somebody to
[1:13:38] care about them
[1:13:40] they're caught up
[1:13:42] now brothers and sisters here we are the
[1:13:46] greater is he that's in you
[1:13:48] than he that is in the world
[1:13:51] and i'm telling you brother and sister
[1:13:53] there's so many people that need to be
[1:13:55] loved
[1:13:56] but they won't let the one that really
[1:13:58] loved them
[1:14:00] they won't let him love them
[1:14:03] because amen
[1:14:05] it's a lack of confidence and faith and
[1:14:07] trust in him
[1:14:09] amen because there's so many people that
[1:14:11] will stand and talk about they have the
[1:14:13] love of god that they're not they don't
[1:14:16] really have what they say and they're
[1:14:18] looking at them and they said that if
[1:14:20] that is the love of god and that is god
[1:14:23] then i don't want that kind of god
[1:14:25] a god that criticizes of god that's
[1:14:28] already always condemning and always
[1:14:30] judging always saying by negative things
[1:14:33] i don't want that one
[1:14:36] but i want a god that really cares about
[1:14:38] me even in my condition
[1:14:42] even when i'm down and even when i'm out
[1:14:44] even when i'm
[1:14:45] in a bad way even when i'm doing bad
[1:14:48] things i need a god that understands
[1:14:50] that all i want to be and all i want is
[1:14:53] you jesus
[1:14:55] all i want is love
[1:14:57] all i want is somebody to care amen
[1:15:02] praise god
[1:15:04] so we reach out to other means and other
[1:15:06] things because we can't get what we want
[1:15:09] they meant from
[1:15:10] seem as though we can't get it from god
[1:15:13] amen see until we ask god and it's not
[1:15:16] coming lord the lord are you there

[1:15:32] for those that would trust me
[1:15:34] oh he'll show himself amen
[1:15:39] oh if you only trust him amen but you
[1:15:42] only want to trust him and you're going
[1:15:43] to have a limited uh trust in god you
[1:15:47] limit the most high god you're only
[1:15:50] going to go
[1:15:51] but so far you're not going to go all
[1:15:54] the way and then you're going to say god
[1:15:56] somehow i believe that i i i i i tried i
[1:16:00] tried
[1:16:01] it's not in trying
[1:16:03] but trust me amen by believing him
[1:16:08] it's not what you tried what you believe
[1:16:11] if you believed in all things are
[1:16:13] possible

[1:16:16] are removed
[1:16:18] and shall not die in your heart but
[1:16:19] believe that what you say you already
[1:16:22] have it
[1:16:23] then you shall have what you say
[1:16:25] are you with me
[1:16:27] see but what happens you say it and you
[1:16:29] don't believe in yourself
[1:16:31] and nothing is done
[1:16:34] but great is he that is in you
[1:16:37] brother and sister let me just
[1:16:39] say who do you think
[1:16:41] this is

[1:17:06] he's greater than i
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:08] brother when you talk about greater amen
[1:17:11] you're talking about god
[1:17:14] the god that was in jesus
[1:17:18] is the same creator god
[1:17:22] that says greater is he
[1:17:26] he is god almighty
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:29] the creator of the heavens and the earth
[1:17:32] greater is he
[1:17:35] hallelujah
[1:17:37] but what good is it
[1:17:39] what good is him being there if you
[1:17:41] don't even believe that he's there

[1:17:48] god
[1:17:50] how great is our god
[1:17:53] how great is his word
[1:17:55] how great is our god

[1:18:06] how great is our god
[1:18:09] what our god can connect sin
[1:18:13] and our god can be manifested in the
[1:18:16] flesh

[1:18:59] delivered

[1:19:07] it's he that's in you
[1:19:10] all that god was he put it into christ
[1:19:12] and all the christ was he put it into
[1:19:14] his church he pulled it into you and i

[1:24:31] all they can see is something to
[1:24:33] criticize
[1:24:35] and they can't help themselves
[1:24:37] and it's almost the way they made
[1:24:40] i said lord they've been hindering the
[1:24:42] blessings of god they call them judgment
[1:24:45] they hit all the time
[1:24:46] things that go wrong

[1:25:44] eat see until he comes down
[1:25:47] but we got a religious spirit a separate
[1:25:49] spirit that we got there we won't let
[1:25:51] jesus come in and give us the right kind
[1:25:53] of spirit
[1:25:55] we're not going to allow him to get
[1:25:57] because we're standing for a
[1:25:58] righteousness but our own human spirit
[1:26:01] we think that's the holy spirit because
[1:26:03] it's a self-righteous judgmental spirit
[1:26:05] and we'll stand up like we'll fight
[1:26:08] for jesus jesus don't need you to put
[1:26:10] have your sword you need to be converted
