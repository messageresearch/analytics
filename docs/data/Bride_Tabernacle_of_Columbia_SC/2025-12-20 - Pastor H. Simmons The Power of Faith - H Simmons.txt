Father, we thank you Lord Jesus for the grace and mercy of God. Peace of God that compasses all knowledge and understanding. Father, we ask you to move here today. Lord God, may you touch hearts, touch minds, touch the Marie families. Lord, it must be mighty difficult today, Lord. Lord, brother Alter Lee and Pebbles and family, God, I pray for them, Lord, that you would touch her and Swan, Lord, and different ones, Lord, in the family, Lord. Comfort their hearts and strengthen them, our sister Paige is lying, sick, Lord, and pray you touch her, Lord. Father in Jesus name. Father just you know how much we can bear Lord. And Father I just pray tonight the Lord God you look upon those that are traveling and out of town Lord. Father I pray that you'll be with them and watch over them on the highways and byways. Oh God will let your blood cover Lord. Bless here the service tonight. Bless your word in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Mark 11:22. We was talking about the key to the door is faith. Amen. And we said that prophet God said he lost the key. Amen. The church has lost the key. Amen. So Jude writing that you earnestly contend, fight for it, contend for the faith that was once delivered into the saints. I believe is if he can say it then, I believe even more so now that we can say, "Let us earnestly contend for the faith that was once to live it to the saints." &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "We got to bring him up out of history and we [snorts] got to bring him on the scene." Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. Mark 11:22. And Jesus answered and said unto them, "What? &gt;&gt; Have faith in God." &gt;&gt; Praise God. Y'all, you can be seated. Have faith in God. If now we understand that faith is the substance of things hoped for and it's the evidence of things not seen. Amen. There was a sermon preached faith the six sense. I think Dr. Kenan and different ones talked about the six sense. Amen. And we heard FF Bodsworth and different ones talk about the six sense. those that had great healing campaigns. Amen. And got move in the Smith weather works and all of those different ones. Amen. And Fenny and talked a lot about prayer and faith. Amen. So there was always those that are oldtime preachers and that spent hours and hours in prayer seeking God. Amen. For the will of God and for you know it takes time to really get with God. And we want to talk about the power of faith. Amen. Faith has power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Power. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you think about faith. Amen. By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So hallelujah. Let me just say faith come by what? &gt;&gt; Hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing what? &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can base your confidence. You can put your faith in the word and if the word said it the Amen. God God is always you can be assure. Amen. The word of God Amen would accomplish &gt;&gt; what God said it to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever God said a word would do, it'll do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's God word. It's not man word. It's God word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us, Amen. Because he can swear by no greater he swear by himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. by two uh immutable things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is impossible for God to tell a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God does not change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He does not change. &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of faith. We said on Sunday, Amen. that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold, your faith would be tested. Whether or not you have it or not, it'll be tested. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we understand that Abraham faith, Amen. Though it tarot for God to give him the promised son, it took 25 years. And when it was look like all hope, the Bible say who against hope believed in hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When there was no hope, he believed in hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Amen. the deadness of Sarah's wound and Amen. HE WAS DRIED UP. IT [screaming] WAS OVER WITH AS FAR AS having a child.
