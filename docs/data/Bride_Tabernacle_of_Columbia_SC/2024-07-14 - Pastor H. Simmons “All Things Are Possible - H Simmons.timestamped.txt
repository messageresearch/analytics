[47:05] the word I thank God again I can depend
[47:09] on
[47:14] God lately we were dealing with looking
[47:17] into the
[47:19] Unseen because the temporal things he
[47:23] said the things that are seen are
[47:24] temporary yes Lord but the things that
[47:27] are not seen are
[47:29] [Music]
[47:30] Eternal
[47:32] and and I I was meditating last night
[47:36] and it says expect
[47:42] unexpected expect the
[47:46] unexpected
[47:48] amen but this morning we want to talk to
[47:51] you about all things are
[47:54] possible so I just read read one verse
[47:58] and
[48:00] perhaps going to the topic this morning
[48:04] and again I thank God for all the
[48:06] ministers if we have ministers in the
[48:09] family or Ministers of the Gospel
[48:11] appreciate you you can stand at this
[48:13] time and want to recognize you thank God
[48:15] for all the
[48:16] ministers God bless
[48:20] you thank God for you appreciate your
[48:23] coming amen
[48:28] um
[48:30] Mark
[48:32] 9 and I'm going to go at the 23rd
[48:36] verse and um just alleviate the reading
[48:40] if you want to stand for that verse for
[48:42] the reading of the scripture that'll be
[48:44] fine it
[48:48] says Jesus said unto him if thou can
[48:54] believe all things are
[48:57] what to him that God bless the word you
[49:02] may be
[49:05] seated this father came to
[49:11] Jesus
[49:14] and his son
[49:17] was ill and deaf and dumb and Spirits
[49:21] had him bound thank you you Jesus
[49:27] and he said that
[49:30] Jesus I've taken them to your
[49:34] disciples and they couldn't
[49:39] happen and uh if you will have
[49:43] compassion if you
[49:46] can do anything if you can help
[49:52] him then I want you to help him
[49:58] and Jesus said in the here
[50:02] if thou can
[50:07] believe then all things are
[50:12] possible I think
[50:15] that not only did he said then but he
[50:18] said to you and I
[50:20] now if you can
[50:24] believe then all things are
[50:28] possible if you can
[50:34] believe no doubt the man had
[50:39] tried not only the disciples uh but he
[50:45] decide you know when we go to the doctor
[50:49] and we go to different places to try to
[50:52] get
[50:53] help when all help
[50:57] has
[51:00] failed the woman with the issue blood
[51:02] she went
[51:05] everywhere but she
[51:07] finally came to
[51:11] Jesus sometimes we come to Jesus is our
[51:15] last
[51:20] resour and then he wasn't
[51:24] sure he said if you
[51:31] can and Jesus required if you can
[51:42] believe when
[51:44] all fails to take the help
[51:49] you when everybody else
[51:53] fail and everything else fail goe
[51:57] amen why don't you take it to
[52:01] Jesus because he will
[52:04] never
[52:08] failure amen praise God the medicine
[52:13] might not
[52:14] work the doctor may not
[52:18] work the pastor may not be
[52:22] able but why don't you take it to Jesus
[52:26] amen
[52:27] why don't you let Jesus have
[52:33] it if thou can believe then all things
[52:38] are
[52:41] possible problem is
[52:45] that
[52:47] folks have trouble with trusting
[52:51] God the song says Lord we can depend on
[52:55] him
[52:57] we have
[53:00] trouble they bought it was about 5,000
[53:05] gathered and they all gathered
[53:08] around
[53:10] and after they heard the message Jesus
[53:14] they were going to send them
[53:16] away and Jesus said don't send them away
[53:19] like they us because they would faint on
[53:23] the way that's right let give them
[53:27] something to eat before they
[53:32] go
[53:34] and the disciples went to look for
[53:37] something to
[53:39] feed uh this 5,000
[53:44] folk and when they went to
[53:48] look they only found two
[53:52] fish and five loads of bread
[54:00] they came back and said Jesus all we
[54:03] could
[54:04] find there's two fish and five loaves of
[54:10] bread Jesus said set the people in
[54:13] companies 500 at a
[54:17] time and let them sat
[54:20] down for the
[54:22] meal we without our caral mind and
[54:26] thinking what in the world is he
[54:32] doing what is huh you got two fishes and
[54:37] you got 5,000 men and women besides
[54:42] children and you say set him
[54:46] down
[54:48] see what's
[54:51] impossible Shake somebody hand tell them
[54:54] the impossible impossible is possible
[54:57] with
[55:02] God With God
[55:05] all I said
[55:08] all things are
[55:13] possible when they sat down and they
[55:16] ate and when they were
[55:20] finished they remain 12 B said it didn't
[55:25] say just basted full that's
[55:29] right now it started with
[55:32] two two fish two
[55:36] loaves two fish and Five Loaves are you
[55:40] with me but the ended off with more than
[55:45] enough amen if you put it in Jesus
[55:50] hand he can
[55:53] multiply if you let him have amen amen
[55:59] amen praise God you're little amen all
[56:02] right he can make it much am but you got
[56:05] to be able to trust
[56:07] him Hallelujah can you see the
[56:11] disciples and the
[56:15] folk what in the
[56:18] world what is he trying to
[56:24] do this isn't
[56:27] possible can he do
[56:30] it oh yes I don't know what situation or
[56:33] problems of what you're going through
[56:35] right
[56:37] now but can he hand
[56:41] it somebody said I'm going through
[56:43] marriage of
[56:46] difficulties somebody said I tried the
[56:49] doctors and seem like my sickness still
[56:52] is
[56:54] there somebody's going going through
[56:57] depression in their
[56:58] mind and they said now the medicine uh

[57:07] working take a little drinking but that
[57:10] ain't

[57:16] it ought to fix it but that ain't
[57:21] working now what am I going to
[57:24] do somebody said I can't live like I'm
[57:28] living because I can't take the
[57:33] pain I can't deal with what I'm going

[57:40] now and sometimes we try to fix it on
[57:44] our
[57:45] own and we look to all types of
[57:52] Remedies but we fail to take it to Jesus
[57:58] and Let Jesus fix it for
[58:02] us now I want to talk about another
[58:06] story in the Bible but I have some
[58:11] testimonies that I can talk

[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:29] now we look
[1:02:31] at Sarah and
[1:02:34] aam yes
[1:02:36] sir and God coming down to visit
[1:02:41] them and they sitting at the tent and
[1:02:45] God
[1:02:47] says to
[1:02:50] Abraham Sarah thy
[1:02:54] wife is going to have a
[1:02:57] child his visitation
[1:02:59] to uh Abraham and Sarah was just before
[1:03:04] Sodom
[1:03:08] burnt just before God burnt
[1:03:13] Sodom he came down and said shall I hide
[1:03:16] from Abraham the thing I'm about to do
[1:03:19] that's
[1:03:22] right and the Bible tells me as it was
[1:03:25] in the days of
[1:03:27] Noah and as it was in the days of
[1:03:31] Sodom said thus shall it be in the day
[1:03:34] when the son of man is
[1:03:37] revealed are you with
[1:03:39] me why do we have to come back to
[1:03:43] Sodom why does the world have to get in
[1:03:47] the condition of
[1:03:50] no before Jesus could come the
[1:03:54] conditions had to be right
[1:03:56] go before judgment
[1:03:59] strike amen sin has to come to its
[1:04:04] peak we're at the end
[1:04:07] now where everything is been
[1:04:11] accepted and people want us to accept
[1:04:14] sin as being the
[1:04:17] normal that's right and wrong as being
[1:04:22] right but we come to a place
[1:04:26] that it's going to be
[1:04:28] somebody that's going to take a stand
[1:04:31] for
[1:04:33] God and said the word of God is
[1:04:37] right it doesn't matter who don't
[1:04:40] believe it it's still
[1:04:46] right I'm going to stand on the Promises
[1:04:49] of
[1:04:51] God
[1:04:53] but just before the body
[1:04:57] change just before the Rapture take
[1:05:00] place
[1:05:03] Sarah and Abraham was getting ready to
[1:05:07] have a visitation of a body change uhhuh
[1:05:10] that's right see they were
[1:05:15] old and the Bible tells us in
[1:05:18] Romans Abraham was about 100 years
[1:05:22] old are you with
[1:05:24] me and
[1:05:26] being about a 100 years
[1:05:30] old he considered
[1:05:33] not his own body that's right as though
[1:05:37] it was
[1:05:39] dead and it dried up neither the dadness
[1:05:43] of Sarah's
[1:05:45] WB but instead of getting weak in
[1:05:48] faith the Bible said Abraham was
[1:05:53] strong in faith amen when we ought to be
[1:05:57] giving
[1:05:58] up when we ought to be shaking our head
[1:06:01] and said no way no
[1:06:05] how
[1:06:08] amen hallelujah am with
[1:06:12] God yes it is I said yes it
[1:06:17] [Applause]
[1:06:21] is Sarah in the tent behind she laugh
[1:06:27] and the angel said why did Sarah laugh
[1:06:32] shall I have pleasure with my
[1:06:34] Lord when I'm so old and wrinkled up and
[1:06:40] death but God said you going to have
[1:06:43] that son sir are you with me praise God
[1:06:48] it's
[1:06:50] impossible tell somebody
[1:06:52] Again The Impossible
[1:06:55] possible is possible is possible are you
[1:06:58] with me it's impossible for man but it's
[1:07:03] possible with God Amen man can't see
[1:07:08] what your faith is
[1:07:10] saying amen Faith looks at the
[1:07:14] Unseen amen asides that it
[1:07:17] is I count those things that be not as
[1:07:21] though they
[1:07:23] are yes they are amen
[1:07:30] yes perhaps he said I don't know how
[1:07:33] you're going to do
[1:07:34] it but I
[1:07:37] believe I believe your
[1:07:39] word I don't know how it's going to be
[1:07:42] done but if God said
[1:07:45] it
[1:07:47] I I believe it if he said
[1:07:51] it then he can do it and I know he will
[1:07:57] because he said he
[1:08:00] [Applause]
[1:08:01] will thank you Jes amen so here they
[1:08:07] receiving a body change it wasn't long
[1:08:10] after they take a
[1:08:13] journey and the
[1:08:16] King Abraham said to Sarah I want you to
[1:08:19] tell them that you my
[1:08:22] sister now as she was not years old and
[1:08:26] rankled up and
[1:08:29] dead but she had received her body
[1:08:32] chains right are you with me yeah she
[1:08:35] was no more old and rankle but she
[1:08:38] become a young girl young lady again
[1:08:40] uhhuh are you with me and he told now
[1:08:45] tell that king and the king and God said
[1:08:49] do the king don't you touch that woman
[1:08:52] that c as a man's wife amen ain't that
[1:08:54] right yeah and he said he he told me she
[1:08:58] told me it was a sister I just kind into
[1:09:00] he said let let him pray for
[1:09:04] you are you with me yes so what happened
[1:09:09] a body changed right in the scripture
[1:09:11] and we've been reading it all our lives
[1:09:13] and didn't know that there was a body
[1:09:15] change right in the
[1:09:17] word if he can do it for them did what
[1:09:21] about the Lord coming amen with a shout
[1:09:25] the voice of an
[1:09:27] archangel amen what about the
[1:09:29] rapture we shall be changed in a
[1:09:33] moment of a twinkling of an
[1:09:36] eye a't that right for that's
[1:09:41] corruptable amen it might seem
[1:09:44] impossible amen but that's corruptable
[1:09:47] much put
[1:09:48] on in
[1:09:51] corruption it takes Faith to believe
[1:09:54] that but somebody
[1:09:56] believe Lord if you can can you help
[1:10:00] him if you can help my son help him Lord
[1:10:04] he said if you
