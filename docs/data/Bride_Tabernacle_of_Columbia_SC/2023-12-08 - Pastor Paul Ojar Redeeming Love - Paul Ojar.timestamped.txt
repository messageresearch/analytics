[42:47] he said no no no she's just a sister she
[42:50] came to pray and there was a glass
[42:52] because I couldn't go in the room and
[42:54] there was a glass between us
[42:56] and like the baby was laying right there
[43:00] and there was tubes all over this
[43:04] baby and I said Satan you're such a wimp
[43:07] to attack a little baby like that why
[43:09] don't you get your
[43:11] match and I said and I saw the de Angel
[43:14] there because the baby had a terrible
[43:16] blood disease there was no cure for this
[43:18] tender little baby and my heart went out
[43:21] to that
[43:23] baby and I said father I'm just asking
[43:26] you to heal this baby tonight I can't
[43:29] touch her but I know that you hear
[43:31] prayer and you answer
[43:33] prayer and I left the hospital just a
[43:35] minute or two I just prayed very simple
[43:38] prayer in my heart and I went home and I
[43:41] laying in the bed and said
[43:43] Lord could you send that baby home in
[43:45] the morning to that mother because I met
[43:48] the mother outside and she was so broken
[43:51] but their language barrier and I just
[43:53] hug her and I give her a thumbs up I
[43:55] said all is well
[43:56] well so I told the father I said all is
[43:59] well and 2:00 in the morning I'm praying
[44:01] I said Lord only one thing I'm asking
[44:04] you I want that baby home tomorrow
[44:06] morning on church I stand Here a
[44:09] testimony I have the baby in my picture
[44:13] and my phone the next day that that the
[44:16] mother slept in the hospital and they
[44:18] discharged the baby the blood was
[44:21] perfect the blood and the baby was just
[44:25] perfect every tube came on that baby and
[44:28] that dead Angel left and the child is
[44:31] perfectly
[44:34] whole there was another
[44:37] testimony this sister when we were in
[44:39] the Congo the last
[44:41] trip they had a long prayer
[44:43] line and they
[44:46] asked no after I was praying I was
[44:48] walking out of church and I was so weak
[44:51] I said Lord I just want a little
[44:52] strength to go in the
[44:54] car and I saw young girl sitting in the
[44:57] chair there lined up for praying her
[44:59] whole leg was broken they cut the leg so
[45:02] many times to put it together and no
[45:05] doctors could put the legs together she
[45:07] was in a bad accident it was broken to
[45:11] pieces and I nailed up before that child
[45:14] I remember my daughter
[45:16] Zoe I said Lord she's like my baby Lord
[45:20] Jesus and I just want you to put the leg
[45:23] back together every bone because you had
[45:25] a greatest surgeon there is Dr Jesus I'm
[45:28] calling you on the scene
[45:30] now you made this body so perfect and I
[45:33] know I know that you can put it back
[45:35] together now church I was SCS all over
[45:38] that child's
[45:40] leg the pastor text me he said sister
[45:43] Hannah she couldn't walk on her own she
[45:45] had to use
[45:47] crutches he
[45:49] said Rebecca is walking normal no more
[45:52] crutches everything is perfectly whole I
[45:56] thank the Lord Dr Jesus came on the
[45:58] scene and touched that the bones and put
[46:02] every bone back
[46:05] together we went to India a few weeks
[46:09] ago there was another sister the holy
[46:11] spirit said get up and go downstairs and
[46:13] while I was walking through the church I
[46:16] saw a girl all her face was
[46:19] scarred and I said I asked the girl
[46:22] what's wrong with her because of the
[46:23] language barrier they said every time
[46:26] she's cooking she falls into the fire
[46:28] and her whole face is burnt up I said
[46:31] Satan Jesus going to get you
[46:33] today oh I prayed for that child and she
[46:35] was perfectly whole she had she
[46:38] epileptic demon was always attacking her
[46:41] and I know my Prophet said that's a hard
[46:43] demon to deal with but nothing is too
[46:44] hard for
[46:46] God and that I left that girl perfectly
[46:49] hold and there's the last
[46:52] testimony while we were going to India
[46:55] we left
[46:57] we went to Miami to get the plane and
[46:59] while at the ticket
[47:01] counter they said you can't go to India
[47:04] we said why they said where are your
[47:06] Visa we said we have no visa she said we
[47:08] can't go on this plane and I said but we
[47:11] could so I called a brother in India I
[47:13] said brother they said we can't come so
[47:16] I said David go check to the supervisor
[47:18] to see what's going on she said you all
[47:20] have to buy a new ticket and go to
[47:22] Dubai and see if you get the visa in
[47:25] Dubai but all the meetings were already
[47:28] planned and we said Lord I know when the
[47:31] enemy when you there's a great blessing
[47:33] Satan starts to
[47:34] fight and church I stand here as a
[47:37] witness we bought a new ticket we went
[47:39] to Dubai and my husband booked the
[47:42] ticket a day after to go to India we
[47:47] were so depending on the Lord for that
[47:49] Visa it had to be
[47:51] Supernatural so the next day we went to
[47:54] the department to get the Visa the lady
[47:57] said there's no way you all can get this
[47:58] Visa they sent us to another department
[48:01] another we had to walk a good way when
[48:03] we reached there they said it takes 72
[48:06] hours that's taking us into Monday now
[48:08] to get the visa so we just went and he
[48:12] is praying and I'm
[48:13] praying but in the night we had the
[48:16] plane to to get the next plane was the
[48:19] following day
[48:21] 1:00 and I'm praying on the bed I said
[48:24] father if if I know the president of the
[48:27] USA I know I can call him whoever great
[48:30] I can call but I know the greatest
[48:32] person on the face of the earth is King
[48:34] Jesus I said father we need the Visa
[48:38] before 9:00 tomorrow because we got to
[48:41] take a taxi to go to the
[48:43] airport church I stand here as a
[48:46] testimony and my husband was praying the
[48:48] same prayer not even knowing what he was
[48:50] saying and I said wake up wake up check
[48:53] your phone to see if the Visa came
[48:54] through and the Visa came through
[48:58] 8:36 that
[49:01] morning thank you Lord Jesus we got
[49:04] dressed and we went we went downstairs
[49:05] we said could you could you could you
[49:08] print out these visas for us they said
[49:10] they don't have color ink they only have
[49:11] black and white ink so they printed out
[49:13] black and white we got to India and in
[49:16] IM in Immigration my husband is there
[49:18] and I'm here they separated us and
[49:22] they're looking they said where did you
[49:24] all get this visa from
[49:26] from I said you're from you all they
[49:29] said no it's not in the system there's
[49:32] no way no evidence that we have a Visa
[49:35] given to you all they they brought all
[49:38] the delegates from the the Indian
[49:40] Embassy to see where we got this visa
[49:43] from but I know the god that we serve he
[49:45] is so
[49:46] real they couldn't find the Visa in the
[49:49] computer they brought all the high
[49:51] immigrations officer to look and they
[49:53] keep looking and they keep looking and
[49:54] they keep looking and they're watching
[49:56] us where did you all get this visa from

[50:21] Visa we went to India we never got sick
[50:25] and everybody said did you get sick did

[50:33] perfect that's the greatest Miracle go
[50:35] to India and don't get sick only God can
[50:39] watch over you in that place because

[1:01:51] men and of angels and have no charity
[1:01:54] I'm become as come as sounding brass and
[1:01:57] a tinkling symbol though I have the gift
[1:01:59] of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries
[1:02:02] and all knowledge and though I have all
[1:02:04] Faith so that I could remove mountains
[1:02:05] and have not charity I am nothing and
[1:02:09] though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[1:02:11] poor and though I give my body to be
[1:02:13] burned and I have no charity it profited
[1:02:15] me
[1:02:16] nothing charity suffer it long and is
[1:02:20] kind charity envieth not charity wanted

[1:03:00] there be prophecies they shall fail
[1:03:02] whether there be tongs they shall cease
[1:03:04] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:03:05] vanish away for we know in part and we
[1:03:07] prophesy in part but when that which is
[1:03:10] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:03:12] part shall be done away when I was a
[1:03:15] child I spake as a child I understood as
[1:03:17] a child I thought as a child but when I
[1:03:19] became a man I put away childish things

[1:10:16] shrewdness yeah she was not of the
[1:10:19] original creation it's not the truth
[1:10:22] amen he couldn't come to Adam with his
[1:10:25] foolishness right
[1:10:29] amen but God allowed it
[1:10:33] all because within him he had all these
[1:10:37] attributes that he wanted to
[1:10:40] express and he wanted to express all
[1:10:43] these attributes in its
[1:10:45] fullness not just in part not just in
[1:10:48] measure amen is that the truth

[1:11:22] what true peace is
[1:11:24] amen so the battles are good amen
[1:11:28] amen and we have true peace in the midst
[1:11:31] of the storm in the midst of the battle
[1:11:33] we have a peace that passed all
[1:11:36] understanding the normal man can't
[1:11:39] understand how could you be so calm and
[1:11:41] peaceful in the midst of the battle yes
[1:11:44] amen amen how can you return love for
[1:11:48] hate how can you return good for
[1:11:51] evil you see there is still in that
[1:11:54] Fallen condition but you've been
[1:11:57] redeemed you've been restored and you've
[1:12:00] been restored back to all that Adam had
[1:12:04] lost
[1:12:07] amen hallelujah I can just see when when
[1:12:11] Adam knew what took
[1:12:14] place do you think Adam had to consider
[1:12:18] take it
[1:12:20] over am I willing to die
[1:12:27] because when he first saw Eve he said
[1:12:29] that's bone of my bone Flesh of My
[1:12:33] Flesh and that love for his
[1:12:37] wife just took a hold of
[1:12:40] him and that kept a hold of him
[1:12:43] throughout his life
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:49] amen so
[1:12:51] when he knew what took place
[1:12:55] Eve was deceived Adam wasn't he knew
[1:12:57] what he was doing he was willing to die
[1:13:00] because he loved his wife so
[1:13:05] much he didn't have to think it
[1:13:08] over he didn't have to consider oh no he
[1:13:12] didn't have to because it just flowed
[1:13:14] from him
[1:13:19] naturally unconsciously he loved his
[1:13:22] wife yes that's the way we ought to love
[1:13:26] one another we not got to consider
[1:13:28] should I love my brother or should I not
[1:13:32] it ought to be unconsciously we love one
[1:13:36] another unconsciously we do good for
[1:13:41] Ev unconsciously our brother is falling
[1:13:45] we don't have to consider will I go
[1:13:47] after
[1:13:49] him redeeming love has been my team and
[1:13:53] shall be till I
[1:13:56] die we can take examples throughout the
[1:13:59] scripture you know we talk a lot about
[1:14:02] Abraham's fate I want to talk a little
[1:14:05] bit about Abraham's
[1:14:07] love amen going after his Fallen
[1:14:11] brother Abraham being a prophet and
[1:14:13] being spiritual he would have known that
[1:14:16] his lot was a caral Believer being
[1:14:20] spiritually minded he would have
[1:14:22] recognized the caral minded lot because
[1:14:25] lot he was just after the things of the
[1:14:28] world oh he wanted he wanted the
[1:14:30] popularity he wanted to be the mayor in
[1:14:32] the city he wanted to be wealthy and all
[1:14:35] these nothing's wrong with that okay
[1:14:37] that's
[1:14:39] fine but don't let let that be the end
[1:14:42] of it all for
[1:14:44] you if the Lord blesses you that way
[1:14:47] that's fine but Let Jesus be the center
[1:14:50] and the team of our life amen amen if
[1:14:53] Jesus is not in it I want
[1:14:57] it goodbye world Amen we just sign it do
[1:15:02] we mean it amen amen
[1:15:07] uhuh we seen lot was
[1:15:11] overtaken the some Army had taken his
[1:15:14] his captured them and and and Abraham
[1:15:17] not he wasn't a soldier you know he was
[1:15:19] just an ordinary man he wasn't a well-
[1:15:22] trained soldier and yeah
[1:15:23] just naturally that love kicked in for
[1:15:26] his Fallen brother for his backslid
[1:15:30] brother isn't that the
[1:15:32] truth
[1:15:34] yes he didn't have to consider it and
[1:15:36] say you know we we had Wars among
[1:15:39] ourselves oh yeah we were fighting and
[1:15:42] fasting and there was Strife among our
[1:15:44] men and I've tried to preach this
[1:15:46] message oh so much to to to lot but he
[1:15:50] just won't
[1:15:52] listen
[1:15:56] you know how sometimes with our children
[1:15:58] we try to teach them the right
[1:16:01] thing and many of times they just won't
[1:16:04] listen does that stop all of
[1:16:08] NOS when it's coming from deep down in
[1:16:10] the soul no no no no son you may go that
[1:16:15] way but I'm staying right here praying
[1:16:17] for you one day God's going to bring you
[1:16:20] back I might go but my prayer is going
[1:16:22] to be remaining there even if I gone on
[1:16:25] to the other side my prayer is going to
[1:16:27] remain there and one day you're going to
[1:16:29] come back redeeming love has been my
[1:16:33] team the one who redeemed me going to
[1:16:36] bring you back I know what redeeming
[1:16:38] love is I know where it brought me from
[1:16:41] and what if it did it for me it'll do it
[1:16:44] for
[1:16:45] you yes
[1:16:51] sir oh he went after he he won the
[1:16:56] battle but still you know L just
[1:17:00] couldn't help being the way he
[1:17:04] is you see just like the way we just
[1:17:06] can't help being the way we
[1:17:08] are you were predestinated to be what
[1:17:12] you are
[1:17:14] amen We Are Who We Are by the grace of
[1:17:17] God it wasn't my choice it was somebody
[1:17:19] chose me oh that ought to produce such a
[1:17:22] love and heart a love that knows no
[1:17:26] bounds a love that we can't
[1:17:29] measure a love that reach down to the
[1:17:31] lowest
[1:17:33] hell yes
[1:17:35] sir a love that Co cover a multitude of
[1:17:39] sin I love that see the need of each
[1:17:43] other that ought to be the team of our
[1:17:49] life isn't that the
[1:17:51] truth yes sir
[1:17:56] you know when God came down and he said
[1:17:59] you know I can't withhold from Abraham
[1:18:03] what I'm going to do Abraham being a
[1:18:05] prophet amen and God comes to reveal
[1:18:08] what he's going to do to His prophets
[1:18:10] isn't that the truth yes
[1:18:12] sir surely the Lord will do nothing
[1:18:14] unless he reveals it to his servants the
[1:18:16] prophets amen so he couldn't withhold
[1:18:19] from Abraham what he was going to do oh
[1:18:26] and here
[1:18:28] comes
[1:18:31] Abraham he gets down on his knee I just
[1:18:35] dramatizing it a little bit
[1:18:37] now so
[1:18:39] Lord for chance it's
[1:18:41] 50 and he goes down and down and
[1:18:45] down what was Lot doing sorry Abraham
[1:18:51] doing
[1:18:53] he was going after his Fallen brother he
[1:18:56] knew that destruction was ahead don't we
[1:18:59] know that destruction's ahead too so
[1:19:03] what it ought to do to
[1:19:11] us what manner of people ought we to
[1:19:15] be you see we we can understand all the
[1:19:21] Mysteries we we can have an a mental
[1:19:25] understanding of
[1:19:26] it yes because we're made different to
[1:19:30] the all the other animals
[1:19:33] right we can reason we can read we can
[1:19:36] understand we can hear we can understand
[1:19:39] we can come to a mental recognition that
[1:19:41] it's the
[1:19:42] truth we can come to a mental
[1:19:44] recognition that this is something out
[1:19:48] of the
[1:19:49] ordinary
[1:19:51] amen but it's got a go deeper than
[1:19:55] that this word's got to Anchor into our
[1:19:58] soul it's got to be anointed by the Holy
[1:20:01] Spirit yes sir to bring it alive in
[1:20:05] us amen
[1:20:08] amen This Love that I'm speaking is not
[1:20:10] just ordinary love
[1:20:13] friends this is the love of
[1:20:20] God and it ought to Flow Free through
[1:20:24] US yes sir the Holy Spirit ought to have
[1:20:28] the liberty and the freedom to flow
[1:20:31] freely through
[1:20:33] US yes
[1:20:51] sir it's good to understand that we've
[1:20:55] been restored
[1:20:58] back to all that Adam had
[1:21:04] lost but God is requiring of
[1:21:08] us a consecrated
[1:21:12] life a certain type of
[1:21:16] walk a certain type of a talk and it
[1:21:20] ought to be so
[1:21:21] unconscious
[1:21:24] it ought to be our
[1:21:27] nature because we're partakers of his
[1:21:30] divine nature aren't we yes
[1:21:34] sir that ought to be who you really
[1:21:40] are I'm a Son of
[1:21:44] God and a son lives a certain
[1:21:47] way a son talks a certain way a son
[1:21:51] thinks a certain certain way a Son of
[1:21:54] God acts a certain
[1:21:59] way God is manifested through a true Son
[1:22:02] of
[1:22:03] God God manifested himself through a
[1:22:06] true daughter of
[1:22:21] God
[1:22:26] now I'm not speaking about a love like a
[1:22:27] a doy old grandfather you know no
[1:22:31] sir you can read that love is not easily
[1:22:37] provoked it suffer at
[1:22:40] long he's not going to always strive at
[1:22:45] man yes
[1:22:47] sir remember it's redeeming
[1:22:50] love amen
[1:22:53] redeeming is to bring back that which
[1:22:55] was lost to its original state
[1:23:00] right so you always had to be
[1:23:04] aart to be redeemed back to this it's
[1:23:08] not the truth yes sir
[1:23:10] oh if you were not a part of
[1:23:14] it then there's no Redemption for you
[1:23:18] right it's not the
[1:23:21] truth
[1:23:25] and when that last one is
[1:23:29] redeemed when that last one is
[1:23:32] redeemed then that's it
[1:23:36] amen but you see you and I we don't know
[1:23:40] who is
[1:23:43] who we don't know who is who and we're
[1:23:46] not to judge who's who because a son or
[1:23:49] a daughter of God could reach so deep
[1:23:53] down in
[1:23:55] sin or so far away they they look
[1:23:58] nothing like a
[1:24:00] seed outwardly they may not look not
[1:24:03] like a seed that's why we ought not to
[1:24:07] judge yes
[1:24:09] sir remember that woman caught in
[1:24:13] adultery look at redeeming love in
[1:24:18] action oh all all all the holy men would
[1:24:22] have seen she was caught in the very
[1:24:25] act caught in the very act well if she
[1:24:27] was caught in the very act where was the
[1:24:36] man so you you already see that's not no
[1:24:39] righteous judgment there
[1:24:43] right that was no righteous judgment
[1:24:50] there what did Jesus say
[1:24:53] he said go and sin no more he said where
[1:24:55] where is your
[1:24:57] accusers he said all if you got no
[1:25:01] sin those without sin cast the first
[1:25:04] stone you know he was that
[1:25:07] one he was that
[1:25:10] one but he came to save his
[1:25:13] own and she was one of
[1:25:16] them yes
[1:25:19] sir and he knew she was one of them
[1:25:26] amen what did he
[1:25:29] do he projected that
[1:25:32] love and the grace of God Sovereign
[1:25:35] Grace took over isn't that the truth
[1:25:38] amen love had reached its
[1:25:40] destination
[1:25:43] amen and Sovereign Grace took
[1:25:47] over yes sir that's what happened to you
[1:25:50] and
[1:25:51] I
[1:25:53] the story may have been a little bit
[1:25:54] different because we all got different
[1:25:56] stories in our lives isn't that the
[1:25:58] truth but it was the redeeming love of
[1:26:01] God that met you in the condition in
[1:26:04] which you
[1:26:06] were and what did it tell you that's not
[1:26:08] the life I called you to
[1:26:11] live that's not a
[1:26:14] life I created you to
[1:26:21] live

[1:26:26] sin yes

[1:31:50] down but he's old already
[1:31:53] defeated you know the prophet said when
[1:31:57] when if he thinks he's got the upper
[1:32:00] hand on you then he'll give you a little
[1:32:03] proposition he like the doctor will tell
[1:32:05] you well you just got six months to live
[1:32:09] the cancer is so bad and there's no
[1:32:11] cure and you can accept that you know or
[1:32:14] you can reject
[1:32:17] it it's like Goliath he he told they
[1:32:21] told Israel they got Israel's back to
[1:32:23] the wall so Israel's going to make a
[1:32:26] deal with them you know like what
[1:32:27] they're doing now is the same old devil
[1:32:30] all the time Same Old Devil he
[1:32:34] he think they got their backs to the
[1:32:36] wall so let's make a deal
[1:32:39] right same devil he comes to you let
[1:32:42] let's make a deal I'll give you just six
[1:32:44] more months to live well I'll tell him
[1:32:47] that's not in your
[1:32:49] hands it's not for you to tell me how
[1:32:51] how long I
[1:32:53] live no
[1:32:55] sir that's not in his
[1:32:59] hands oh
[1:33:03] dear Satan would do a thing like
[1:33:09] that now if he thinks you got the upper
[1:33:12] hand he'll do that but if you got him in
[1:33:15] a
[1:33:17] corner I said if you got him in a corner
[1:33:20] amen amen
[1:33:23] you'll see what a coward he really
[1:33:26] is when he sees real perfect love comes
[1:33:29] on the
[1:33:31] scene yes
[1:33:33] sir when you see real perfect Faith come
[1:33:36] on the scene now Faith and love are
[1:33:38] married together you know they kin folks
[1:33:41] you can't have one without the other no
[1:33:45] sir
[1:33:50] yes oh oh
[1:33:52] hallelujah oh those early Apostles had
[1:33:55] him in such a corner that the very
[1:33:57] Shadow he was afraid
[1:33:59] of yes
[1:34:01] sir what manner of people ought we to
[1:34:10] be what a powerful Invincible group of
[1:34:13] people want we to
[1:34:17] be because it's not you doing
[1:34:20] it it's your almighty God doing it
[1:34:22] through you and I but we got to learn to
[1:34:25] get ourselves out of the
[1:34:27] way we got to learn to Humble
[1:34:32] ourselves Master the thought of human
[1:34:35] ability realize you can't do it but
[1:34:38] there is someone who
[1:34:40] can and he's chosen to do it through you
[1:34:44] yes sir he's chosen to do it through
[1:34:48] you he's called you to this walk amen
[1:34:52] he's called you to this life this
[1:34:54] invincible
[1:35:05] life and when you realize who you really
[1:35:14] are what you really been called
[1:35:17] to you come up a little
[1:35:20] higher
[1:35:23] and as he reveals more because it takes
[1:35:25] a revelation to do this to your life you
[1:35:27] know it it's not had knowledge and I
[1:35:30] didn't come here today with good
[1:35:32] psychology
[1:35:34] okay you got to have a supernatural
[1:35:36] experience with God Amen you got to know
[1:35:39] him the power of his
[1:35:41] resurrection you got to know what power
[1:35:43] you really God within you by the Holy
[1:35:50] Spirit
[1:35:52] and what you've been called
[1:35:57] to we're called to adoption you know in
[1:36:00] this
[1:36:04] day so all these trials and these
[1:36:08] testings it's for own
[1:36:12] good it's to perfect
[1:36:20] us
[1:36:22] to bring out a perfect
[1:36:24] God in all his perfect power and might
[1:36:28] and
[1:36:29] strength and
[1:36:33] victory
[1:36:35] love his
[1:36:39] sweetness his
[1:36:41] kindness his
[1:36:44] gentleness whatever for whatever
[1:36:48] situation whatever might be the
[1:36:50] situation
[1:36:53] be so yielded to
[1:36:57] him that he takes control of that
[1:37:00] situation yes sir for every situation
[1:37:04] may be different we're dealing with many
[1:37:06] different people here today and
[1:37:09] everybody's got their own fighting their
[1:37:12] own battle and their own situation but
[1:37:14] you know he's dealing with each and
[1:37:18] everyone yes sir and their own way he
[1:37:21] knows what you have need
[1:37:28] of and if I could just get myself out of
[1:37:31] the
[1:37:32] way if you can just get yourself out of
[1:37:35] the way if we all can get ourselves out
[1:37:38] of the
[1:37:39] way I let him just flow through
[1:37:45] us let them anoint that faith that
[1:37:48] you've got in your
[1:37:50] heart
[1:37:52] he'll take control of that
[1:37:54] situation he'll do the things that you
[1:37:56] know nothing
[1:37:57] about for his ways a past finding out
[1:38:01] isn't that the truth yes sir and the
[1:38:05] sooner we can
[1:38:07] learn to yield
[1:38:11] ourselves now that's the secret between
[1:38:13] you and God you know I can't teach you
[1:38:16] that I can't teach you that you got to
[1:38:20] have that experience for your yourself
[1:38:22] and you ought to become so familiar with
[1:38:24] it I I hope you you you got what I'm
[1:38:30] saying that you're so
[1:38:32] sensitive to his
[1:38:37] presence yes
[1:38:39] sir and you'll see him take control of
[1:38:42] that
[1:38:44] situation it don't take much loud words
[1:38:47] it don't take much words at
[1:38:50] all you remember the disciples when they
[1:38:52] try to cast out that
[1:38:55] devil maybe lots of shouting and
[1:38:57] screaming or whatever and all Jesus had
[1:39:00] to do was come out of it you see those
[1:39:04] words were anointed
[1:39:05] words and SATA knows the difference you
[1:39:08] can't Bluff him he's a bluff so he knows
[1:39:11] a good
[1:39:13] bluff I said he's he's a real good bluff
[1:39:16] so he knows you you can't Bluff him
[1:39:18] better than he can Bluff right
[1:39:23] and you can't Bluff this love you can't
[1:39:24] Bluff this Faith you can't Bluff this
[1:39:27] anointing he knows the genuine thing
[1:39:30] he's a spirit so he knows the real thing
[1:39:32] and he's afraid of the real
[1:39:34] thing when he sees the real thing coming
[1:39:38] he know he backs up in a corner and you
[1:39:40] see the real coward that he really is
[1:39:42] because he's absolutely
[1:39:44] defeated yes sir
[1:39:48] amen do you really believe that amen
[1:39:58] aren't you thankful that we serve a god
[1:40:00] like that that has brought us right back
[1:40:01] to
[1:40:02] that so what are you telling them I've
[1:40:04] got to do BR Paul we got to consecrate
[1:40:07] ourselves
[1:40:08] more we got to be more
[1:40:11] sincere all this power is already within
[1:40:14] you you know when you receive the Holy
[1:40:16] Ghost it's already within
[1:40:19] you but you got to learn to unlock it
[1:40:23] and let it flow so freely as he
[1:40:27] would you got to learn when to
[1:40:30] stand when he'll stand and he'll stay
[1:40:33] still when he'll speak you got to
[1:40:37] learn isn't that the
[1:40:41] truth this is not about going empty in
[1:40:43] all the hospitals and showing how no
[1:40:47] sir song's good huh we would like to do
[1:40:50] do that I would like to do that I don't
[1:40:53] like to see people
[1:40:56] suffering but I want to be in the
[1:40:57] perfect will of God all the
[1:41:00] time I don't want to misstep I want to
[1:41:02] be like how it was in the Garden of Eden
[1:41:05] in the perfect will of God for they were
[1:41:07] in the perfect will of God all the time
[1:41:09] isn't that the truth and that's what
[1:41:10] we've been restored back to the perfect
[1:41:13] will of
[1:41:19] God how can I do this brother
[1:41:23] Paul I got to consecrate myself
[1:41:26] more I got to dedicate myself more I got
[1:41:30] to be so yielded and fully surrendered
[1:41:32] in his
[1:41:34] hands I got to be as Paul said a
[1:41:37] prisoner of Jesus
[1:41:39] Christ I got to love him so
[1:41:43] much now that love is already within you
[1:41:46] yes it
[1:41:47] is because you recognize his love to
[1:41:50] towards you and when you recognize that
[1:41:53] a God could love you so much in the
[1:41:55] condition that you were and make you to
[1:41:57] what you are it ought to produce isn't
[1:42:00] that the truth a love back to him it
[1:42:04] ought to produce a
[1:42:05] fate yes
[1:42:09] sir I believe his every word his every
[1:42:16] promise but I believe the Lord's calling
[1:42:19] us friends
[1:42:21] I truly believe that because I believe
[1:42:24] the Rapture is at hand I believe we're
[1:42:27] living way below our
[1:42:31] privileges with what we
[1:42:41] got he's calling
[1:42:43] us he's calling you and
[1:42:49] I today
[1:42:51] to Humble ourselves
[1:42:53] more more yielded so fully yielded in
[1:42:57] his
[1:43:04] hands that way he says go out
[1:43:07] go what he says do I
[1:43:11] do he'll speak through
[1:43:14] me it'll be so unconscious I'm so
[1:43:18] yielded to him that unconsciously
[1:43:22] he'll flow through me and I'll hear
[1:43:24] myself
[1:43:26] saying
[1:43:28] yes I'll hear myself saying isn't that
[1:43:32] what was demonstrated before us in this
[1:43:36] day well that's for you and
[1:43:38] I God's calling us to this perfect fate
[1:43:43] this perfect
[1:43:44] walk that's what we've been redeemed

[1:43:53] us we're being called to

[1:44:03] dark glass
[1:44:05] anymore no
[1:44:08] sir the Seal's been revealed we can see
[1:44:12] God's Great Plan of Redemption made
[1:44:14] plain before our
[1:44:17] eyes we can see what lays ahead for
[1:44:23] us well let's

[1:45:15] people and your talk remember he took a
[1:45:16] along lot with him and not until he was
[1:45:19] fully
[1:45:21] separated could God begin to bless him

[1:45:28] things in our lives you would know
[1:45:29] personally what he's calling you to You'
