[32:22] we want to look this morning at the book
[32:24] of acts 19
[32:26] chapter
[32:29] god is good his mercy is everlasting his
[32:32] truth endures let us just stand in the
[32:34] reading of the word
[32:46] acts 19 and 1 it says
[32:49] and it came to pass that while polos
[32:51] with that conrent
[32:53] paul having passed through the upper
[32:54] course came to ephesus
[32:57] finding certain disciples he said unto
[32:59] them
[33:00] have you received the holy ghost since
[33:02] you believe
[33:03] and they said unto him we have not so
[33:05] much as heard whether there be any holy
[33:07] ghost
[33:08] and he said unto them unto what then
[33:12] were you baptized and they said unto
[33:15] john into john's baptism then said paul
[33:19] john very baptized with the baptism of
[33:21] repentance
[33:23] saying unto the people that they should
[33:24] believe on him
[33:26] which should come after him that is on
[33:28] christ jesus
[33:30] when they heard this they were baptized
[33:34] in the name of the lord jesus
[33:37] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[33:39] them
[33:40] the holy ghost came on them and they
[33:43] spake
[33:45] with tongues and prophesied and all the
[33:48] men there were about twelve
[33:49] maybe by heads father we thank you for
[33:52] the reading of your word we thank you

[34:39] name
[34:40] amen
[34:44] we thank god i was
[34:48] just out here praying early this morning
[34:50] and as i was out here praying i was just
[34:52] rejoicing and i tell you
[34:56] i was just speaking a little in tongues
[34:59] and
[35:00] prophesying a little and i said i wish i
[35:02] could just
[35:03] turn the uh record on
[35:06] and i could just play it back what i was
[35:09] listening to
[35:10] because i was just enjoying the lord
[35:12] amen
[35:14] and the things that he was speaking to
[35:16] my spirit now
[35:17] i certainly were enjoying was enjoying
[35:20] it
[35:21] i'm glad to see charity this morning god
[35:23] bless you charity
[35:25] amen thank the lord for each and every
[35:28] one
[35:28] again uh
[35:32] here we're in acts the 19 chapter
[35:36] and it talks about have you received the
[35:38] holy ghost
[35:40] since you bleed i don't
[35:44] perhaps i won't preach this morning just
[35:46] talk to you a little bit
[35:49] i find that the greatest need and the
[35:52] greatest
[35:52] problem in the church is the people
[35:58] as a whole have not received the baptism
[36:02] of the holy ghost
[36:04] sometimes they're preachers sometimes
[36:06] they're deacons
[36:08] sometimes they've been in the church for
[36:13] years 20 30 40 years
[36:18] and have not received the holy ghost you
[36:21] know it's something about
[36:23] thinking that you have it believing that
[36:26] you have it
[36:28] but you really don't have it
[36:32] the thing is the question is have you
[36:35] received it
[36:36] and if if not do you want it
[36:40] now the holy ghost is not just a thing
[36:44] as a feeling it's not just
[36:48] an imaginary thing the holy ghost is
[36:50] actually
[36:51] jesus when he was going away he said i
[36:54] will not leave you comfortless
[36:55] but i will come to you he said i'm with
[36:58] you but i shall be in you
[37:01] the holy ghost is not a thing
[37:05] but the holy ghost is a person
[37:09] and it's this jesus that walked the
[37:12] shows of galilee the one that died on
[37:14] the cross and all
[37:16] that same jesus that was in flesh
[37:19] which was a word made flesh that same
[37:22] jesus was to go back
[37:24] to the father and he was going to send
[37:27] back
[37:28] the comforter and that comfortable would
[37:31] it would be the life that was in the
[37:34] blood
[37:36] that created jesus christ the father of
[37:39] jesus christ
[37:40] which was the spirit the bible said when
[37:44] mary conceived the holy ghost
[37:46] overshadowed mary
[37:48] and she was and it said the holy thing
[37:52] which is in you it was the creation of
[37:55] the beginning of the creation of god
[37:58] where god became flesh god became a man
[38:01] but the holy spirit was the one that
[38:04] created the egg
[38:06] and the seed so the holy ghost was the
[38:10] father
[38:12] that same holy ghost in making you and i
[38:15] sons and daughters of god that same holy
[38:18] ghost had overshot of mary
[38:21] that she was able to concede and bring
[38:23] forth jesus christ
[38:25] is the same holy ghost that god wants to
[38:28] come down and impregnate us with him
[38:31] that we can have jesus in us
[38:34] are you with me so he wants we want
[38:38] jesus as married a man
[38:41] carried a physical body we carry a
[38:45] spiritual
[38:46] amen jesus the very
[38:49] life amen of god
[38:52] in our bodies now it's up to us
[38:57] amen while we are actually
[39:00] amen impregnated or will spirit
[39:03] fill amen the holy ghost
[39:07] shall lead us guide us unto all truth
[39:11] amen he is the one that leads in god
[39:15] and he's the one that wants preeminence
[39:18] in our lives
[39:21] he wants to be in control of us that he
[39:24] can lead us
[39:25] not just to amen a promised land like it
[39:29] was
[39:30] in uh in the book or or or
[39:33] exodus amen but god wants to
[39:36] lead us not to a place like joshua took
[39:40] them to canaan
[39:41] but god wants to lead us to glory
[39:45] amen and god wants us to enter into
[39:48] a kingdom uh an invisible kingdom
[39:52] amen that we might be amen have
[39:56] an invisible union with god amen
[39:59] god through the holy ghost amen wants to
[40:02] make
[40:03] you and i one amen
[40:07] for the purpose was the eve was to bring
[40:09] reproduce
[40:10] adam and the purpose of the bride the
[40:13] church
[40:14] is to reproduce christ
[40:17] amen the purpose of the wife and the
[40:20] husband coming together
[40:22] the broad tree is to bring forth fruit
[40:27] are you with me he said that your fruits
[40:30] may remain
[40:32] hope i didn't get too far
[40:35] but have you received the holy ghost
[40:39] since you believe because sometimes it's
[40:43] just an
[40:43] imagination sometimes it's a good
[40:46] feeling when the feeling is over amen
[40:49] we're still
[40:50] our same old same old
[40:53] amen and we don't want to see
[40:57] the old man and you know we use a little
[41:00] for a little sub topic renewed
[41:05] in the spirit now some i i'm not saying
[41:08] that you don't have the holy ghost
[41:11] and i'm not saying i'm saying sometimes
[41:13] we need to be restored or renewed
[41:15] in the spirit sometimes they call it a
[41:19] refilling
[41:20] of the spirit because sometimes things
[41:22] happen in life
[41:24] and amen and sometimes we go through
[41:27] they met some bad places sometimes and
[41:29] sometimes things happen
[41:31] to knock us down and amen but we have to
[41:34] get
[41:34] up sometimes this confession and
[41:38] repentance have to take place in our
[41:40] lives
[41:41] we have to confess and understand or
[41:44] amen
[41:44] that we have fallen amen
[41:48] sometimes we fall away from grace and
[41:50] and we need the grace of god to be
[41:52] restored in our lives
[41:55] sometimes things hinder us in our spirit
[41:59] but the holy ghost
[42:03] he said have you received the holy ghost
[42:06] tonight
[42:07] since you believe now it's very
[42:11] important because most people in most
[42:13] churches most preachers teach that
[42:16] when you believe that you're born again
[42:19] and that you have the holy ghost when
[42:22] you believe when you accept jesus as
[42:24] your personal savior
[42:25] they teach you that you're born again
[42:28] and you have
[42:29] the spirit of god okay
[42:33] but the question was acts
[42:37] of of the disciples
[42:41] at this time he said in the second verse
[42:44] he said unto them
[42:45] have you have ye received the holy ghost
[42:50] what
[42:52] he did not take away and tell them that
[42:56] they were not believers
[43:00] what happens a lot of time in the
[43:02] apostolic faith and
[43:04] those that believe in the oneness of god
[43:07] and the baptism of in the world in the
[43:10] name of jesus christ
[43:11] oftentimes they tell people that they're
[43:13] not believers
[43:16] and jesus never told them because
[43:20] amen they didn't have the holy ghost
[43:22] that they were not believers
[43:25] but he said have you received the holy
[43:27] ghost
[43:28] since ye believe
[43:32] are you with me uh i'm saying i
[43:35] acknowledge the fact that you are
[43:37] believable but have you received the
[43:40] holy ghost
[43:42] now we understand that some people the
[43:45] reason why they conduct their lives in
[43:47] certain ways
[43:48] but they really love god and believe god
[43:50] but they conduct their lives
[43:52] it's not in the beauty of holiness it's
[43:54] not a sanctified life
[43:56] a lot of times it's not a clean living
[43:59] person
[43:59] they can curse a little bit drink a
[44:01] little bit run around a little bit and
[44:04] do all kind of stuff but they can come
[44:05] to church and say i believe i'm a
[44:07] believer
[44:08] why because i confess jesus christ as my
[44:11] personal savior and he's come into my
[44:14] life
[44:14] and i am a believer i i love the lord
[44:18] no question many times that's the truth
[44:22] but it's also he said if you love me
[44:24] keep my commandments
[44:27] are you with me see uh uh uh sometimes
[44:31] we we have to go a little farther than
[44:33] just saying i'm a believer we got to
[44:36] keep the commandment we got to keep the
[44:38] word
[44:39] but how can we keep the word amen when
[44:42] we don't have the keeper in us
[44:45] amen it's impossible for us to keep the
[44:48] word
[44:49] without the people in us without the one
[44:52] that's gonna
[44:53] keep you from falling you need the holy
[44:56] ghost to keep you
[44:58] from falling okay
[45:02] now let me just look at uh acts 18
[45:06] and 24 it says and a certain jew
[45:10] named apollos born of alexandra an
[45:14] eloquent man and what
[45:17] he was mighty he was what mighty
[45:21] in the scripture you know
[45:25] came to ephesus this man instructed
[45:30] was instructed in the way of the lord
[45:32] and being fervent into what
[45:35] you cannot say this man amen didn't know
[45:39] nothing this man
[45:42] was uh amen eloquently this man
[45:45] knew the word and you couldn't say the
[45:48] man that was not anointed
[45:51] you know you got a lot of folk that
[45:53] don't have no anointing in their life
[45:55] and they go out condemn people because
[45:57] they know one little point more than the
[46:00] other
[46:01] and they so busy condemning that man but
[46:04] instead of uh
[46:06] a condemning the man i believe a quill
[46:08] and priscilla
[46:09] seller recognized amen
[46:13] that this man amen had a gift and god
[46:16] was using this man
[46:19] and they wanted to help this man and
[46:22] amen and acknowledge the fact that this
[46:24] man was very gifted
[46:27] and this man really amen was showing the
[46:30] people
[46:31] amen uh that jesus was lord
[46:35] and that's something brother sister
[46:37] because some people today
[46:39] don't know that jesus is lord
[46:42] and the bible said no man can say to
[46:44] jesus the lord but by the holy ghost
[46:46] so somewhere along the line that man had
[46:49] got a revelation
[46:50] and he had gotten in touch with god in
[46:53] some kind of way
[46:56] but he oh lord sometimes we try
[47:00] we're so busy trying to take away from
[47:02] folks
[47:04] some people they just live like they got
[47:06] it all and they got to take something
[47:08] away from a man
[47:10] and instead of trying to give somebody
[47:13] something
[47:13] they are so busy condemning to that it
[47:16] makes them a very sad creature
[47:20] some people can't be happy because
[47:22] they're so busy on the condemning side
[47:25] and all times trying to find some kind
[47:28] of fault
[47:29] in somebody amen
[47:32] that's a miserable life to live that you
[47:34] go to church you find
[47:36] fault you they may go to work you find
[47:38] fault
[47:39] amen everywhere you look you find fault
[47:41] in everybody but you
[47:45] amen everybody amen uh uh somebody close
[47:49] to you
[47:49] somebody you think amen is one of yours
[47:54] other than that you find fault amen you
[47:57] look at
[47:57] them and this ain't right and that ain't
[48:00] right and this
[48:00] ain't right and uh and just spend all
[48:04] your lifetime
[48:07] just finding fault instead of amen come
[48:10] in oh amen god bless you my brother god
[48:14] bless you my sister
[48:17] ain't god good brother amen god is so
[48:20] wonderful real servant a good god
[48:23] oh no uh have you heard the ladies and
[48:27] gossip do you know what happened to
[48:32] sister sue
[48:33] and brother uh oh
[48:36] kingfish
[48:40] you know what i'm saying brother sister
[48:43] folks are so
[48:44] busy in other folks business and other
[48:47] folks
[48:47] matter amen until instead of trying to
[48:51] encourage folk
[48:52] they are condemning for
[48:56] instead of saying pastor i really
[48:58] enjoyed that message
[48:59] truly it was a blessing this morning he
[49:02] said
[49:02] what in the word a pastor trying to say
[49:07] he missed out on so and so
[49:11] you know instead of seeing the good in a
[49:14] person
[49:15] there are folks that come to church to
[49:17] find evil
[49:18] and all kind of critical amen but if
[49:22] they would
[49:22] only examine their own self and see
[49:25] whether or not they're
[49:27] in the faith and start critic or oh they
[49:29] take constructive criticism
[49:32] amen the bible said examine yourself and
[49:35] see whether or not
[49:35] you are in the faith amen the bible
[49:39] search me oh lord touch my heart and you
[49:42] know i'm out here crying
[49:44] out lord touch me lord try my rain lord
[49:47] i'm not worthy
[49:50] i'm not worthy of your mercy i'm not
[49:52] worthy of your goodness
[49:53] i'm not worthy to stand up here amen and
[49:55] try to
[49:56] tell you what's right do you think that
[49:59] i'm so good that i have a right to do
[50:01] that
[50:02] but it's by the grace of god i am what i
[50:04] am
[50:06] it's only by the grace of god
[50:09] amen and i thank god for his grace this
[50:13] morning
[50:14] and each and every one of us ought to
[50:16] thank god for the grace of god
[50:18] amen not that we are not holy now
[50:22] but god's grace is upon our lives
[50:28] here it says the bible says he said
[50:33] fervent in the spirit of man and speak
[50:37] and talk deal into the things of the
[50:39] lord knowing only the baptism of john
[50:42] some folk all they know is the baptism
[50:46] in the name of the father son holy ghost
[50:48] that's all they know
[50:50] but what they do know
[50:54] and that baptism in the name of the
[50:56] father son holy ghost
[50:58] they are sometimes they are very
[51:01] knowledgeable
[51:02] and well learned men knowing that this
[51:05] uh alexander was a very taught and
[51:08] well-learned
[51:09] eloquent man but he didn't know
[51:13] see like a lot of folk don't know that
[51:16] father is not a name
[51:17] you know you know he went to school in
[51:20] new england
[51:21] better than i myself i believe that man
[51:24] knew our english better than priscilla
[51:27] and
[51:29] aquila i believe that man was more
[51:33] more intelligent than they were
[51:36] but it was a revelation that god had
[51:38] given in that age
[51:40] at that recycle a particular time that
[51:43] he had not received as yet
[51:46] and they didn't come with a proud spirit
[51:49] hey
[51:50] you don't know what i know
[51:53] you know how some folk take it you going
[51:55] to hell
[51:58] i look at you i know you ain't right
[52:01] because you don't
[52:02] know what i know oh can't you see how
[52:06] mean
[52:06] some folks are yeah
[52:09] you know you know
[52:12] got a little apostolic preacher that
[52:14] comes on and he condemns everybody think
[52:17] you know if god just shined a light on
[52:19] him for about two minutes
[52:22] all that bigness and badness and make
[52:25] people think
[52:26] well he's saying a lot of the right
[52:29] things
[52:30] it mean the right way but it's a way the
[52:33] bible says speak the truth in love
[52:36] are you with me you can have truth but
[52:39] you don't have no love with him
[52:41] and you do more damage than you're doing
[52:43] good and what are you doing you're
[52:46] producing a lot of meaningful
[52:49] and those mean folklore amen go out and
[52:52] express it like you
[52:53] express it and cause a lot of folk that
[52:56] would have believed they don't believe
[52:57] because you got
[52:59] mean folk out there trying to tell folks
[53:02] something
[53:03] and folks the kind of religion the kind
[53:05] of god that you got i don't want him
[53:09] are you with me see you want god to be
[53:12] easily with love and kindness have i
[53:15] drawn you
[53:16] you want a god that amen that you that
[53:19] that's
[53:20] really reaching out his hand and love
[53:23] and amen
[53:23] and showing amen that he cares about you
[53:26] amen and he loves you now i i
[53:29] care about you i know you got fault
[53:32] maybe
[53:32] jesus would have came to the woman at
[53:34] the well and said
[53:35] a woman you ain't no good you need to
[53:38] repent
[53:40] got all these husband and shacking up a
[53:43] woman you ain't
[53:44] no good you need to get yourself right
[53:48] you know you know some of us are man i
[53:51] ain't got time for that
[53:52] kind of person you see what kind of
[53:53] punches you
[53:55] but jesus took time out to send the
[53:57] disciples away
[53:58] because he knew that they wouldn't
[54:00] understand y'all go and go buy me
[54:02] something
[54:06] send them away because they ain't gonna
[54:07] they ain't gonna understand they ain't
[54:09] gonna have no compassion on this woman
[54:11] but jesus knew what time the woman was
[54:13] gonna come and he had need to go by
[54:15] samara
[54:17] you see what i'm saying and i'm saying
[54:20] jesus
[54:20] amen amen cannot use you to reach that
[54:24] one to have a need in their life because
[54:26] you've gotten so high-minded and so holy
[54:29] that you don't understand how to have
[54:32] compassion
[54:34] are you with me but you and i must have
[54:37] compassion
[54:38] amen we all going to make mistakes in
[54:41] this life we're going to say
[54:42] something or do something that we have
[54:44] no business saying or doing
[54:46] but one thing about it we understand
[54:48] amen
[54:49] that god is a mercy for god and god will
[54:51] forgive
[54:52] us and god would help us amen if we only
[54:55] repent
[54:58] be renewed in your spirit brother sister
[55:03] it says here i got to go on because i i
[55:06] don't know where i got that from and
[55:08] because i tried to be simple and plain
[55:11] and just go through this little simple
[55:12] subject
[55:14] okay it says here
[55:21] and he speak boldly in this and he began
[55:24] to speak
[55:25] boldly in the synagogue whom
[55:29] when aquila and priscilla had heard
[55:32] they took unto him
[55:36] and expounded unto him the way of god
[55:39] more perfectly see sometimes you can't
[55:42] just stand up in front of a person and
[55:44] try to make them
[55:46] look bad because you know something they
[55:48] don't know
[55:49] on the job or in the school or somewhere
[55:53] and you see the person and you know how
[55:54] some folk they see a person that
[55:57] don't look like them and they say oh
[56:00] what and they start preaching on them
[56:02] and they'll start talking about them and
[56:04] they'll start
[56:05] in their mind you know like jesus
[56:08] amen the woman was washing his feet with
[56:10] his hair
[56:11] and uh she was a prostitute and maybe
[56:14] got that money
[56:15] to buy that all he meant through her
[56:17] prostitution but she was anointing his
[56:19] feet with all
[56:20] and simon in his and all his religious
[56:23] buddies
[56:24] looking at that woman and said you know
[56:27] this man supposed to be a prophet and
[56:29] supposed to be knowing a holy man and if
[56:32] he
[56:32] if he'd have known what kind of woman
[56:34] that was stooping down there
[56:36] and kissing his feet and washing it
[56:39] he look at him but he said simon
[56:44] since the time i came into your house
[56:48] you didn't greet me with a kiss and you
[56:50] didn't uh give me no water to wash my
[56:52] feet
[56:54] that's the thing you do in those days
[56:59] but this woman since the time she came
[57:01] in cease not to
[57:03] kiss my feet and anoint him amen
[57:07] this woman he said now wherever the
[57:11] gospel is preached
[57:12] i want this woman to be in knowledge
[57:16] are you with me so jesus took the time
[57:20] out to all the critical spirits
[57:24] and that's what i'm saying instead of
[57:25] being critics now
[57:27] it's time to shut up amen and
[57:32] and be renewed in your spirit and get
[57:34] the baptism of the holy ghost it's time
[57:36] to stop all this criticizing
[57:39] amen because it's not doing you any good
[57:41] amen
[57:45] you know i was going to talk about let
[57:47] me just go and skip over
[57:49] of polos and let me go on get with
[57:55] i want to say like the old people said
[57:58] uh
[57:59] psalms 51. let's get down to business a
[58:03] little bit but i don't want to say what
[58:04] the old folks said because it might not
[58:06] be
[58:06] proper to sit in the pool pier
[58:11] let's go and get down to this point amen
[58:15] one of the points when we're dealing
[58:17] with being renewed in the spirit
[58:19] because a lot of people don't know re
[58:22] reno
[58:23] renewing and restoring comes with an
[58:26] acknowledgement it comes with confession
[58:30] it comes with an understanding that
[58:33] somewhere along the line
[58:34] something has caused our spirit to be
[58:37] contaminated or dirty
[58:40] amen see david understood that his
[58:44] spirit was not clean he said
[58:47] uh uh wash me with his
[58:51] that i might be clean i i'm dirty
[58:55] and brother and sister when when you
[58:57] dirty and when you filthy
[58:59] you're not happy you know why you see so
[59:03] many christians
[59:04] unhappy because it's some kind of dirt
[59:06] it's in their life
[59:10] and i i hear david in psalms 51
[59:14] had committed adultery and had taken you
[59:18] rod's wife
[59:20] and and he had uh taken the shiva and
[59:24] he had he had done a bad thing
[59:27] and that bad thing i i can see david
[59:29] going into the house of the lord
[59:31] and i can see him always he had to deal
[59:34] with that in the
[59:35] in his mind and in his spirit in time
[59:38] past you know i i i i took and i put the
[59:41] man on the front line
[59:43] i took and i killed uh had the man
[59:47] killed and i took his wife oh just think
[59:51] how david must have felt
[59:52] when he went to the church and he heard
[59:54] the word and he still
[59:56] tried to praise the lord you know how we
[59:58] try to praise the lord but something
[59:59] ain't right
[1:00:01] we're trying to hallelujah oh lord oh
[1:00:04] you're trying to convince yourself that
[1:00:05] you really
[1:00:06] love really holy lord i love you and god
[1:00:09] says you got to get it right
[1:00:12] you need see god sent a prophet to david
[1:00:15] david
[1:00:16] he knew david amen couldn't he just
[1:00:19] couldn't get it fixed right
[1:00:20] he just couldn't do it so god had to
[1:00:22] send nathan on and tell david

[1:10:30] amen god is good
[1:10:34] oh he said restore
[1:10:37] if you want to be restored your joy
[1:10:41] then there's a process that david had to
[1:10:43] acknowledge
[1:10:45] his sins and his shortcomings brother
[1:10:48] i said have you received the holy ghost
[1:10:51] since you believe
[1:10:53] and if you receive the holy ghost amen

[1:11:06] restoration has come i've been restored
[1:11:10] amen to my place in christ

[1:11:20] come amen i i
[1:11:23] trust that you be oh brother and sister
[1:11:27] if you're not going farther enough or
[1:11:28] deep enough
[1:11:29] it's time now that we go further nothing
[1:11:31] deep enough
[1:11:33] it's time now to re-reach out into the
[1:11:35] deep and
[1:11:36] amen grab ahold of god in a personal way
[1:11:39] and say lord i want everything
[1:11:42] amen everything that you want me to have

[1:11:50] soul god i want to go all the way with
[1:11:53] you
[1:11:55] it's time to start reaching out brother
[1:11:57] sister
[1:12:01] praise god there's a reason why amen we
[1:12:04] don't get from god what we want
[1:12:07] is because amen we don't go farther
[1:12:09] enough as the prophet said with him
[1:12:12] amen we don't stay long enough for amen
[1:12:16] on the altar we don't cry out long
[1:12:18] enough until we get
[1:12:19] amen get it right
[1:12:23] i've seen a lot of people amen get the
[1:12:25] spirit on them and i've seen a lot of
[1:12:27] people get touched by the spirit
[1:12:29] and sometimes i know
[1:12:32] and they confess i got the holy ghost
[1:12:34] brother simmons and
[1:12:36] later on in their life it might take
[1:12:38] five ten years down the road
[1:12:40] sometimes 15 20 years down the road and
[1:12:43] i'm
[1:12:43] always praying the lord give them a
[1:12:46] deeper touch
[1:12:48] lord give them a deeper touch maybe a
[1:12:51] minister will come from africa maybe
[1:12:52] somebody
[1:12:53] come from japan maybe somebody come they
[1:12:56] got
[1:12:57] to say a word maybe they're getting a
[1:12:59] holy ghost field
[1:13:00] meeting and something the power of god
[1:13:03] will just take
[1:13:04] over lord they need a deeper touch they
[1:13:07] think they
[1:13:07] got it but lord they need a little bit
[1:13:10] more
[1:13:11] brother and sister if they don't get
[1:13:13] that little bit more
[1:13:15] something to come by amen and their life
[1:13:18] are going the wrong direction

[1:13:24] because they didn't go
[1:13:26] farther enough amen i don't want you to
[1:13:29] be one of those ones
[1:13:30] they meant to fall away from christ amen
[1:13:33] and get caught up and let other things
[1:13:36] in this world and in this life steal
[1:13:38] your joy from you
[1:13:40] amen i want you to know that nobody can
[1:13:43] take
[1:13:43] what god has given you the devil
[1:13:45] couldn't take they meant that life
[1:13:47] away from adam and eve but they had to
[1:13:50] give it away
[1:13:51] amen and god said i give you they meant
[1:13:54] the gift of the holy ghost i give you
[1:13:56] amen the spirit amen it's free
[1:14:00] nobody can take it from you amen and
[1:14:03] what god gives you
