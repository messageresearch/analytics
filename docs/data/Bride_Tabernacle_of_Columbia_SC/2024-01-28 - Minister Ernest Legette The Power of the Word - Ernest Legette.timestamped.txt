[43:02] grace of
[43:03] God Hebrews 6
[43:06] and we'll begin at
[43:10] the want to begin at the 12th verse
[43:16] amen let's begin at the 13th verse and
[43:19] he says for When God Made made promise
[43:22] to Abraham because he couldn't swear by
[43:26] no greater he swear by himself saying
[43:30] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[43:32] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[43:35] after he had patiently endured he
[43:38] obtained the promise for men verily
[43:41] swear by the greater and an oath for
[43:44] confirmation is to them an end of all
[43:47] Strife wherein God willing more
[43:50] abundantly to show unto The Heirs of the
[43:52] promise the immutability of his counsel
[43:55] confirmed it by an oath that by two
[43:57] immutable immutable things in which it
[44:01] is impossible for God to tell a lie how
[44:03] many glad for that this morning I said
[44:06] it's impossible for God to tell a lie so
[44:09] the things that God spoke toward uh
[44:12] concerning you and I it is impossible
[44:15] for God to tell a lie amen come on our
[44:18] faith we might not believe it and it
[44:20] might hold it up but it is impossible
[44:22] for God to tell a lie Hallelujah so he
[44:26] says we might have or as apostle for God
[44:29] to tell a li we might have strong consol
[44:32] who have fled for Refuge should lay hold
[44:34] upon the Hope set before us which hope
[44:37] we have as an anchor of the Soul both
[44:40] sure and steadfast and which entereth
[44:43] into that within the veil whether the
[44:47] Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus
[44:51] made an high priest Forever After the
[44:54] order of MDC may God had a blessed to
[44:56] the reading of his word this morning we
[44:59] says we want to just talk for a moment
[45:03] and that's something that the Lord just
[45:04] put on my heart and I was meditating on
[45:06] it for a while now it's it's just the
[45:09] power of the word
[45:10] amen just how much life is in the word
[45:14] you know we know that the the letter
[45:16] kills but the spirit giveth life but
[45:18] it's so much life in the word you know
[45:22] you know when you reading the Bible it's
[45:25] not just some the book that you're
[45:27] reading but it's life in that book it's
[45:30] power in that book and the Devils know
[45:33] that too don't they and that's why they
[45:36] they try to keep you away from that and
[45:38] being down on your knees in prayer
[45:40] because it's it's power in the word of
[45:42] God hallelujah when you read the word
[45:45] it's it's things in the word that just
[45:47] lift you up out of whatever you going
[45:50] through you you say Lord I need a word
[45:53] but God always send a word to lift you
[45:55] up out of of that what you in you know I
[45:57] was thinking about that and that's what
[45:59] it is when we talk about the power of
[46:01] the word you know it's something about
[46:05] God's word Can't Fail none of his words
[46:07] will fall to the ground and and won't
[46:09] accomplish that which he sent it to do
[46:12] but he said just as the you know the
[46:14] water rain falleth unto the earth and
[46:17] the snow it's got a purpose in it don't
[46:19] it he says to bring forth seed to bring
[46:21] forth bread all those things and to
[46:23] nourish it it it's got a purpose and
[46:26] that purpose is a powerful purpose right
[46:29] he and it falls because it falls and it
[46:31] does the job of what it was intended to
[46:34] do so he just used that he says but even
[46:38] as that is that way so my word is come
[46:41] on he says it left my my mouth and it
[46:45] ain't going to return unto me void what
[46:47] I sent it to do it'll do what I sent it
[46:50] to do and the devil that's why I like
[46:53] that saying that I think brother Jackson
[46:55] was saying the other night you are what
[46:57] the word says about you come on you are
[47:01] what the word says about you that's what
[47:03] you are you might not feel it yourself
[47:06] you might not believe it yourself but
[47:08] what the word says about you that's what
[47:10] you are because God cannot lie come
[47:14] on God can't
[47:17] lie his word you know you you think
[47:19] about what you walking in what are you
[47:21] walking in you walking in the favor of
[47:23] God ain't you you blessed because God
[47:27] says you
[47:28] blessed come on I was saying the other
[47:32] week who God bless is blessed ain't they
[47:37] and who God curs is cursed right come on
[47:41] because God you can't you can't alter
[47:43] God's word you know I I was reading the
[47:47] other day where it says well a man rob
[47:49] God right he says and how will you rob
[47:51] me he said in tithes and offerings
[47:54] Malachi 3 he says in tithes and
[47:57] offerings he's talking about how you
[48:00] know you curse with a curse when you rob
[48:02] him right no matter how much you try to
[48:06] bless yourself or people try to bless
[48:08] you you cursed with a curse why because
[48:11] you rob God right but on the other hand
[48:15] he says try me he says bring them to the
[48:18] storehouse and says and see won I bless
[48:21] you come on he says see w i open up the
[48:25] windows of heaven and pour out blessings
[48:28] upon you come on you blessed
[48:32] Hallelujah and that's the thing about it
[48:35] God's word can't fall to the ground can
[48:37] it come on he says try me Hallelujah but
[48:41] we find that I says that that God's word
[48:44] is is uh powerful he says you know I
[48:47] like how here and I don't know how
[48:50] really we're going to get it but it says
[48:52] here in uh Hebrews 6 you know he's
[48:55] speaking to Abraham I mean you know we
[48:57] know it was in Genesis but here Paul
[48:59] going back over it again he says you
[49:01] know about the promise that God made
[49:03] Abraham right and it was because of his
[49:07] faithfulness right God made him a
[49:10] promise because Abraham had came to a
[49:13] point in his life to where he would do
[49:16] anything that God required of him he was
[49:19] uh God asked him to come out from among
[49:21] his Kindred he came out didn't he God
[49:24] told him I'm bless you even after the
[49:26] blessing God told him to give them back
[49:28] to me and he was willing to do that
[49:29] right but he begin to say in blessing
[49:32] I'mma bless you come on I'm going
[49:34] multiply you not only you but your seed
[49:37] after you right and so we know that that
[49:41] it's a blessing just was the blessing
[49:43] was just on the natural seed wasn't it
[49:46] come on and just because he blessed the
[49:48] their fathers the the blessing was on
[49:50] the children right now we know that a
[49:52] lot of times the children would get out
[49:54] of the way and God God would have to
[49:56] punish them right but nevertheless even
[49:59] though he punish he would punish them
[50:01] that would be only to get them back in
[50:04] line to what the word of God says back
[50:07] into the line so therefore he can
[50:09] continue to bless them amen right and
[50:13] that's what God you know uh we being a
[50:16] Seed of Abraham is the Bible says in
[50:18] Galatians 3 you know if we be Christ
[50:21] then we're Abraham's seed right not only
[50:24] we Abraham's seed but says that we we we
[50:27] are Hees to the promise right am Hees to
[50:30] the promise come on the the we we we've
[50:34] been blessed abundantly right God and it
[50:38] wasn't through of none of nothing that
[50:40] what we've done to obtain that but it
[50:43] was God through his election right
[50:46] before the foundation of the world he
[50:48] decided to pick you right he already
[50:51] knew what decision youd make what
[50:53] choices you make so from the foundation
[50:55] of Of The World God had you in his mind
[50:57] right and he calls you his elect because
[51:00] he knew that one day you'd hear the call
[51:03] and The Voice come on you hear that
[51:05] voice and it's something would Quicken
[51:07] you and I think about that sometimes
[51:10] come on no matter the mess that you were
[51:13] in come on Amen no matter the rotness
[51:16] the filth the darkness that you were in
[51:19] you were you were a part of God from the
[51:21] beginning amen you belong to God and you
[51:24] going back to him amen come on
[51:27] Hallelujah no matter the darkness am
[51:31] come on no matter the place that you
[51:33] were in it's by election ain't it you
[51:37] know we sang that song I don't know why
[51:39] Jesus loved me and I don't know why he
[51:41] cares I don't know why he came and
[51:44] sacrific his life oh but I'm glad I'm so
[51:47] glad he did come on Hallelujah but you
[51:52] know we belong to Christ right so we're
[51:55] heirs to the promise come on he said in
[51:59] blessing I bless you we heirs to the
[52:01] promise right come on join HS with
[52:05] Christ I believe that with all of my
[52:06] heart so we look at you know what what
[52:10] are the promises come on Hallelujah we
[52:13] look at those promises and I says that
[52:16] God he swore by himself come on it was
[52:19] no greater that he could swear by he
[52:21] swore by himself come on and that still
[52:24] hold true right the power of the word
[52:29] still holds true to the day in the face
[52:32] I look at that in the face of sickness
[52:34] the power of the word still holds true
[52:38] don't it come on he said with the
[52:41] stripes you were heal the word left his
[52:44] mouth and it won't return to him void
[52:46] will it but it'll accomplish healing in
[52:49] somebody I believe it come
[52:52] on Hallelujah God is something
[52:56] something's got to happen you know I
[52:58] said the power of the word you know that
[53:00] we know the spoken word is the Original
[53:02] Seed come on we always talk about how we
[53:05] were in the Bible study with the
[53:07] children and sharing with them you know
[53:09] uh the birds fly blind all those things
[53:12] and all that says everything you see is
[53:15] a product of the spoken word everything
[53:18] you see come on is a product of what God
[53:21] spoke one day and it came
[53:23] about come on the power of the word God
[53:26] spoke it and it came about God created
[53:29] those trees and apples and all those
[53:31] things he said let them bring forth
[53:33] after their own kind right and from then
[53:37] hallelujah they still producing right
[53:40] and reproducing and bringing forth why
[53:43] the natural tree you might say have died
[53:45] but the life that was in the tree is
[53:47] still around come on because why that
[53:50] life came from God himself didn't it
[53:55] come on and you can't kill that life can
[53:58] you the life that life when God spoke it

[55:18] devil can't kill that life can he oh
[55:21] Jesus y'all believe that come on and
