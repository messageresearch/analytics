[40:30] the book of luke the 20th chapter

[41:00] if you want the background amen this is
[41:01] when jesus come back to jerusalem before
[41:04] the crucifixion and you know when he get
[41:06] back he already making the scene
[41:09] going to the temple you see them selling
[41:10] the sacrifices and different things so
[41:12] he going in with the whip and
[41:14] flipped the money tables over amen and
[41:16] said my house is a house of prayer you
[41:18] made a dinner thieves man
[41:20] and what he starts to do is he he
[41:22] preaches a little bit more even before
[41:24] he goes off the scene
[41:25] the 20th chapter in the first verse it
[41:27] reads and it came to pass
[41:30] that on one of those days
[41:33] hallelujah sometimes it's one of those
[41:34] days amen
[41:35] but on one of those days
[41:37] as he taught the people in the temple
[41:40] and preached the gospel amen he was
[41:43] preaching teaching
[41:45] the chief priests now not just anybody
[41:47] now but the chief priests
[41:50] and the scribes came upon him with the
[41:54] elders
[41:55] and spake unto him saying
[41:58] tell us
[42:00] but what authority does now these things
[42:04] uh who is he that gave thee this
[42:07] authority now think about the question
[42:09] that they asking but here here here's
[42:11] the creator of heaven and earth here's
[42:14] the one who is about to give himself as
[42:16] an eternal sacrifice forever and they
[42:19] got the audacity to ask him about what
[42:22] authority do you even have to preach
[42:24] within the temple
[42:27] who gave you this authority amen
[42:30] now look how jesus answered me sometimes
[42:32] we don't answer every question but what
[42:34] he does is he answers that question with
[42:36] a question yeah but i don't want to
[42:37] blast the same sound this this is a
[42:39] strong mic man according to god
[42:42] this friday night even that's when the
[42:44] eagles fly i'm feeling all right tonight
[42:46] even
[42:46] and we work hard today until we work
[42:48] hard today
[42:50] i said that's because the devil know we
[42:52] got to preach tonight we had a very busy
[42:53] day amen
[42:56] hallelujah now he answers them
[42:59] with a question him and they ask about
[43:01] what authority are you doing these
[43:02] things he answers them with a question
[43:04] and he answered and said unto them
[43:06] i will also ask you one thing
[43:09] and answer me
[43:11] the baptism of john because everybody
[43:13] knew who john was wasn't from heaven
[43:16] or of men
[43:18] what jesus was trying to get them to say
[43:20] was it was these things that you seen
[43:22] and what you saw going on and the things
[43:25] that was taking place on the scene was
[43:27] this a work and a move of god or was it
[43:31] a work and a move of man amen and that's
[43:34] a question that you have to figure out
[43:37] as an individual when you see things
[43:39] taking place when you see things going
[43:41] on is it a work and a move of god
[43:45] or is it a work and a move of man amen
[43:50] and what happened you see they don't
[43:51] have much revelation the fifth verse it
[43:53] says and they reason with themselves
[43:55] saying if we shall save from heaven he
[43:58] will say well why then you you believe
[44:00] ye him not
[44:02] but and if we say of men all the people
[44:06] stone us for they be persuaded that john
[44:08] was a prophet and they answered they
[44:10] said
[44:11] that they could not tell from whence it
[44:14] was
[44:15] now you know there's a lot of things
[44:17] that people don't understand there's a
[44:18] lot of things about science that people
[44:20] can't figure out but you know when it
[44:22] comes to the things of god it is very
[44:25] important for you to be able to tell
[44:27] where that thing is coming from because
[44:30] otherwise you could be thinking that
[44:32] you're doing god a service without it
[44:34] being his will you could think that
[44:36] you're going in the right direction but
[44:39] you are making a pathway straight to
[44:41] hell amen so it's very important for you
[44:44] to be able to answer the question from
[44:46] which these things came from amen
[44:49] first then they answered that they could
[44:51] not tell whence it was and they first
[44:54] said well if you don't know i can't tell
[44:55] you i can't preach it to you and jesus
[44:58] said unto them neither tell i you by
[45:00] what authority i do these things amen
[45:03] for a title tonight amen we're gonna
[45:05] take from man or from god amen
[45:09] from man uh from god let's just buy his
[45:12] one more time father god in the name of
[45:14] jesus lord this
[45:15] oh it's just a privilege lord where we
[45:17] can gather together with brothers and
[45:19] sisters are like precious faith dear god
[45:22] lord people who have committed their
[45:24] lives to the gospel lord and taking a
[45:26] stand for you father god
[45:28] and lord knowing that lord you you know
[45:31] all things you see all things though you
[45:33] rewarding your people lord and i ask
[45:35] that you would give them a double
[45:36] portion of rewards tonight father god
[45:38] lord we always look to leave this place
[45:40] different than how we came in father god
[45:43] and lord how we changed up about a
[45:45] preacher of the gospel lord lord we
[45:47] thank you for your word lord lord howard
[45:49] it speaks to us all that changes this
[45:51] lord is it's not about me as a man
[45:53] father god but lord it's always about
[45:55] your people dear god and about your
[45:57] people being blessed lord and we thank
[45:59] you for that in the love the name of our
[46:01] lord and savior jesus christ may the
[46:03] saints say amen
[46:04] hallelujah you could be seated tonight
[46:10] you know when we look at our scripture
[46:12] verse tonight
[46:14] and you see the people that was on the
[46:16] scene questioning jesus
[46:18] and and when you realize that it it
[46:21] wasn't just anybody out on the scene but
[46:24] the bible lets us know that these were
[46:27] the chief priests amen
[46:29] these were the scribes these these these
[46:32] weren't just the starting out breaches
[46:34] these these weren't maybe just the
[46:36] deacons of the church but these was the
[46:38] knowledgeable people
[46:40] these was the teachers of the people the
[46:42] people that were supposed to be uh
[46:45] leading the rest of the people as
[46:47] shepherds
[46:49] and here they are the greatest thing to
[46:52] ever walk the face of the earth
[46:55] and kid jesus christ is there in the
[46:57] flesh
[46:59] preaching the gospel to the people in it
[47:02] and these people amen them being learned
[47:05] scholars seemingly they would have had
[47:07] an understanding of who he was and where
[47:10] he came from
[47:13] see the problem is even though they were
[47:15] leaders even though they were educated
[47:17] even though they had a lot of knowledge
[47:19] maybe of different things around what
[47:22] was going on in israel
[47:24] when it came to the things of god
[47:27] that did not have any revelation in it
[47:31] now us being believers amen that's being
[47:33] master believers we've been well taught
[47:35] about the importance of revelation amen
[47:38] it's a very basic concept to us amen
[47:41] church age book it starts out with cain
[47:44] and abel were brothers
[47:45] but brother branham lets us know that
[47:48] that that that abel had a revelation
[47:52] about what type of sacrifice to offer
[47:54] and even though cain was his blood
[47:56] brother cain did not get that same
[47:59] revelation and what that let us know is
[48:02] that god gives revelation to whom he
[48:05] sees fit
[48:08] and when you get a revelation from god
[48:11] nothing can move you from that
[48:13] revelation it becomes a driving force
[48:16] behind your life it changes how you walk
[48:20] how you talk how you act how you see the
[48:23] word how you conduct your business
[48:25] everything is changed just from you
[48:27] having a personal revelation of jesus
[48:30] christ
[48:31] and on the contrary if you don't have a
[48:34] revelation a personal revelation of
[48:37] christ these things become hard for you
[48:40] amen
[48:41] it don't make any sense
[48:43] you can't understand it because it seems
[48:46] like it's something that comes from man
[48:51] here jesus christ is on the scene
[48:54] he was doing everything that he was
[48:56] promised and prophesied to do it man he
[48:58] called the wonderful counsel of mighty
[49:00] god everlasting father prince of peace
[49:02] amen everything that he was prophesied
[49:04] to do on the scene
[49:05] he was healing people i mean
[49:08] he was healing men that was blind from
[49:10] their birth amen people that was was
[49:12] crippled they may they saw the miracles
[49:14] the water turned into wine even the five
[49:17] thousand fed by the fish and the five
[49:19] loaves i mean they saw all kinds of
[49:21] things taking place when it came to
[49:24] miracles they they saw people's lives
[49:26] being changed where the filthiest of
[49:28] sinners whether it was the publicans the
[49:30] tax collectors that was out there man
[49:32] whether it was the prostitutes of the
[49:34] street coming to wash his feet with
[49:36] their hair man whether it was zacchaeus
[49:39] amen coming down from out of that tree
[49:41] he was a rich man but but he recognized
[49:44] christ when he was on the scene they saw
[49:46] people's lives being changed
[49:49] some miracles taken place
[49:51] some sitting there teaching and
[49:53] preaching the gospel and yet they still
[49:56] couldn't get out of their own way
[49:58] because they had a certain mindset and a
[50:01] certain vision of how god should be
[50:03] packaged and how god should operate and
[50:06] that got in their way and they could not
[50:08] catch the move of god by revelation
[50:14] all the things that was going on and
[50:17] they had to sit there and ask him but
[50:18] what authority are you doing these
[50:20] things in man
[50:22] and the whole thing should have been
[50:23] very plain and should have been very
[50:25] obvious
[50:27] the lord himself said a kingdom divided
[50:30] against himself shall not stand so you
[50:33] wonder how i'm casting out these devils
[50:35] and i'll cast out these demons he said
[50:37] they cannot cast out satan
[50:39] so it's a very basic concept that they
[50:42] should have been able to have an
[50:43] understanding of who he was and where he
[50:46] came from and what was going on at that
[50:48] point in time
[50:51] he answers that question with a question
[50:54] the things that you've seen taking place
[50:57] what you've seen going on was it
[51:00] something that came from heaven or was
[51:02] it something that came from man
[51:07] the preaching that you see amen
[51:09] the teaching that you see the doctrine
[51:11] that's going forward man
[51:13] christ even said down to the baptism
[51:15] that that john was preaching
[51:18] did it come from god or did it come from
[51:20] man and the reason why i i take time
[51:24] with that question
[51:26] is because we know the hour that we are
[51:28] in on god's great time clock
[51:31] and see that's a a question that
[51:34] everybody has to be able to answer for
[51:37] themselves it's a very personal question
[51:41] it's a question that your soul depends
[51:45] on
[51:45] are these things a move a man of all
[51:49] these things
[51:50] a move of god even
[51:53] and one thing i always liked about god
[51:55] is that he is in the business of making
[51:58] things personal to you amen
[52:01] he ain't always in the business of
[52:03] letting you just sit in church and
[52:05] everybody else praising the lord and it
[52:07] looks like we going by group revelation
[52:09] no this thing is not a group revelation
[52:11] you're not going to make it on a group
[52:13] revelation you're going to have to have
[52:15] a personal experience with the man for
[52:17] himself and the only thing that's going
[52:19] to get you all the way into the promised
[52:22] land is a personal experience with him
[52:24] amen
[52:26] that group revelation that the israel's
[52:28] israelites came out of egypt with that
[52:31] might have gotten them over the red sea
[52:33] but that did not get them out of the
[52:35] wilderness
[52:36] it only took the only thing that got
[52:38] them out of the wilderness was a
[52:41] personal revelation of what was going on
[52:45] in the promised land and a personal
[52:47] revelation that they was more than able
[52:50] to take the promised land amen
[52:55] we ain't operating by a group revelation
[52:57] of that in this our way man god is in
[53:00] the personal business he's in the
[53:02] business of you having a personal
[53:04] revelation just like he asked peter well
[53:06] who do you say that i am maybe
[53:08] what do you say for yourself
[53:11] whether you young whether you old
[53:14] whether you got a husband what you got a
[53:15] wife everybody got to give an account
[53:18] for their own experience in this hour
[53:23] when people look at things amen
[53:26] and see that something is only a work of
[53:28] manny man if this thing was only a work
[53:30] of man it would only be able to take
[53:32] your butt so far man
[53:34] a worker man it'll start out for a
[53:36] period of time but then it'll start to
[53:38] fade away when things get rough or when
[53:42] things get tough or the going gets
[53:43] harder when things get confusing when
[53:45] something is a worker man it falls apart
[53:49] but if it is a move of god amen
[53:52] there is not a force
[53:54] in hell that can stop it amen
[53:58] if it's a move of god you can go ahead
[54:01] and put all your chips on the table with
[54:03] it amen and he won't let you fall amen
[54:06] if it's a move of god you can make a
[54:09] life investment into it because god is
[54:12] an eternal god amen he's god and he
[54:15] changes not amen heaven and earth shall
[54:17] pass away but his word cannot pass away
[54:21] so our encouragement to the people of
[54:23] god amen
[54:24] is if you can recognize by revelation
[54:28] that the measure the hour that you're
[54:29] walking in it is not a move a man but
[54:32] it's a move of god this move of god will
[54:35] be able to take you all away man
[54:37] hallelujah glory to god amen
[54:41] there are some rewards that come with
[54:44] you moving in the move of god amen
[54:47] sometimes moving in the move of god it
[54:50] can be unpopular sometimes moving in the
[54:53] move of god there might be some
[54:54] sleepless nights it might be some rocky
[54:57] road sometime but i'm here to remind you
[55:00] and just encourage you for a little
[55:01] while tonight if it is a move of god
[55:05] god is in the business of fulfilling his
[55:08] word amen
[55:09] and all you got to do is abide in the
[55:11] word of god amen and he is going to make
[55:14] sure that his people are taken care of
[55:18] hallelujah how many love the lord
[55:20] tonight
[55:21] hallelujah
[55:23] bless the lord
[55:25] now y'all recognize that we live in a
[55:27] very deceptive age amen the prophet of
[55:30] god said this is one of this is the most
[55:33] deceptive age out of any age amen that
[55:36] that's why this age requires more faith
[55:39] than any other aj man
[55:41] because it's more deception amen
[55:44] that's the whole thing with the land
[55:45] it's inspiring man that you think that
[55:48] you do all right but you're really naked
[55:50] miserable wretched poor blind don't even
[55:53] know about it amen so so it's a
[55:55] deceptive age
[55:57] where maybe a certain church or certain
[56:00] experience think that they're going in
[56:02] the right direction and god said well
[56:04] that's lukewarm i spew it out of my
[56:06] mouth amen
[56:07] you don't even know where you're at
[56:10] it's a deceptive age
[56:12] and see humans when it comes to the
[56:14] thing of god
[56:15] because we try to use our little what we
[56:17] call a p brain amen we try to put that
[56:20] in the god mindset
[56:22] and so we try to look at things
[56:24] of god from our own mindset and what it
[56:27] does is it causes so much deception and
[56:29] it caused so much confusion in me
[56:32] see what happens is is people will say
[56:35] that god is doing something oh this is
[56:37] the move of god that's god doing
[56:39] something and then the further you go
[56:41] you realize the thing getting further
[56:43] and further away from the word
[56:45] and that is not a move of god it's a
[56:47] movement man amen
[56:49] cause he man do stuff that's pleasing to
[56:50] him man do stuff to make him feel good
[56:52] man do stuff that make him feel
[56:54] comfortable amen
[56:56] you know remind me of uh the story of
[56:59] the children of israel
[57:01] and they had a prophet on the scene by
[57:03] the name of samuel
[57:06] and and what happened is the bible lets
[57:08] us know it's about first samuel eighth
[57:10] chapter the bible lets us know that the
[57:12] children of israel they want to be like
[57:14] all the other nations amen they say well
[57:17] the other nations all of them got kings
[57:19] but we don't got a king
[57:21] samuel we need a king that can go in
[57:23] front of us and battle and help us fight
[57:26] our battles and stand there before us
[57:28] and look real good in front of the
[57:30] people and and say no don't do all of
[57:33] that amen
[57:35] you got a king the jehovah god is your
[57:39] king
[57:40] and what actually happens in the
[57:42] scripture
[57:44] is that samuel takes a while and starts
[57:45] to prophesy to him as i said well if you
[57:47] get a king he he takes a whole chapter
[57:49] and said you get a cane oh my he gonna
[57:51] take your daughters and have them in his
[57:53] bakery's he gonna take his sons and have
[57:55] him in his arms he gonna have some
[57:57] building his palaces he gonna put tax on
[57:59] the people all the way on down to this
[58:01] if you get a king a natural can't he
[58:03] gonna do this and do that
[58:05] but nevertheless the people in their own
[58:08] mindset and their own desires said nay
[58:12] but give us a king so we could be like
[58:14] everybody else
[58:15] and what happened they picked the wrong
[58:17] person to be they came they picked saul
[58:19] off a high he looked because he was head
[58:21] and shoulders tall above the rest he had
[58:23] those muscles amen he was graceful
[58:26] and what happened they moved in a
[58:28] complete opposite direction from god
[58:32] because they were stuck in their own
[58:34] mindset on how the king should look at
[58:36] me
[58:37] when almighty god was already the king
[58:40] see they got deceived and got caught in
[58:42] a move of man when a move of god was
[58:45] already right there on the scene amen
[58:48] so so sometimes people think that things
[58:51] are move of god
[58:53] when it's actually a move for man amen
[58:58] it's important amen for us to be able to
[59:00] understand amen
[59:03] when somebody just thinks that's you
[59:05] doing things because a man told you to
[59:07] do it man
[59:08] you doing things because a prophet told
[59:11] you to do it
[59:12] that's been dead for 50 years for uh a
[59:14] goalie man
[59:15] think that you're doing things just
[59:17] because your pastor told you to do it
[59:20] and they start to look at different
[59:21] things that you do
[59:23] and try to box it in as being a move of
[59:26] man amen
[59:28] and miscompletely that is almighty god
[59:32] doing the working man
[59:34] because what happens in this lady to see
[59:36] her age that's all around us people get
[59:38] so quick to pass things off as just
[59:40] being a move of man
[59:42] and it's really a move of god on the
[59:45] scene amen
[59:49] you know what it does is it is it is it
[59:52] forces people to have to to to realign
[59:55] and realize what is your attitude
[59:57] towards this message
[1:00:01] when you talk about a prophet amen it's
[1:00:04] easy for people to get caught up and
[1:00:06] these things just being a move of man
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:10] but then when you start to to look at
[1:00:12] how this prophet lines up with the word
[1:00:15] of god
[1:00:17] malachi 4 and 5 and then comes on the
[1:00:20] scene amen
[1:00:21] and you can look back to amos uh three
[1:00:24] and seven eight minutes and realize that
[1:00:26] god don't do anything except he show it
[1:00:28] to his servants the prophets first
[1:00:31] then you look at malachi 4 and 5 he tell
[1:00:33] you about how he he sent
[1:00:35] elijah the prophet back onto the scene
[1:00:37] again get your heart turned in the right
[1:00:39] direction then you look in luke 17
[1:00:42] and it tells you what's going to be
[1:00:44] going on amen and that day when the son
[1:00:46] of man is revealed how they be eating
[1:00:48] and drinking god noses are eating
[1:00:50] drinking aj man
[1:00:52] hallelujah how to be planting and
[1:00:55] building
[1:00:56] but they don't build so much denying the
[1:00:58] prices of houses now that thing does
[1:01:01] skyrocketed saints
[1:01:03] they can't even get enough wood to build
[1:01:06] houses anymore so the same old houses
[1:01:08] that made it went for two hundred
[1:01:10] thousand dollars a couple years ago that
[1:01:12] same house might be 280 300 thousand
[1:01:15] dollars amen
[1:01:17] because it's an age of bills baby
[1:01:22] we start to see how the messenger has
[1:01:24] showed us how these scriptures are
[1:01:26] coming in together amos three and seven
[1:01:28] uh malachi 4 and 5 luke 17 amen then all
[1:01:32] of a sudden the prophet of god he's
[1:01:33] revealing these church ages out to us in
[1:01:35] revelation 3 amen then he said how the
[1:01:38] church ages unfolding to the seals amen
[1:01:40] then the seals unfold until the troubles
[1:01:43] of israel amen then the trumpets unfold
[1:01:46] and to the vows and what these things
[1:01:48] start to show you is this they can't be
[1:01:50] a mover man amen
[1:01:52] it's got to be a move of god because
[1:01:55] everything is congruent with the
[1:01:57] scripture amen and like brother brennan
[1:01:59] said it's like a roman candle a minute
[1:02:01] go off and then another revelation go
[1:02:03] off in the next revelation and go off
[1:02:06] and you start to realize you can't even
[1:02:08] exhaust the thought of god amen because
[1:02:11] it is a move of god it keeps reflecting
[1:02:14] itself out through the word of god
[1:02:17] it allows things to keep moving and
[1:02:20] going forward because if it was a mover
[1:02:23] man it would have failed a long time ago
[1:02:25] with me
[1:02:28] that brother brown said anytime
[1:02:29] something get going good it fall back
[1:02:31] and denominate a back
[1:02:33] and all of a sudden you got a bunch of
[1:02:34] churches they can't even preach the
[1:02:36] gospel to the people amen
[1:02:38] they can't have teller to live right
[1:02:40] anymore
[1:02:41] that can't preach more than a social
[1:02:43] gospel to actually show you where christ
[1:02:46] is that he's not back here in in the new
[1:02:48] testament just in matthew mark luke and
[1:02:50] john but christ is hearing his people
[1:02:51] amen
[1:02:53] that can't get the people prepared for a
[1:02:55] rapture man
[1:02:58] that can't cause you to make sure that
[1:03:00] you get your calling election showing
[1:03:02] man
[1:03:04] some people look at things and sometimes
[1:03:06] get these things mixed up as just being
[1:03:09] a move a man a man but god has blessed
[1:03:12] you tonight with a revelation amen
[1:03:15] that you can understand that god is
[1:03:18] moving and when god is moving
[1:03:22] you won't just be barely holding on amen
[1:03:24] but you're gonna be getting stronger
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:27] when god is moving when you can't hold
[1:03:30] yourself
[1:03:31] he is going to hold you amen because of
[1:03:34] the move of god and you moving to his
[1:03:35] direction amen
[1:03:37] all you got to do is keep feeding on the
[1:03:40] word of god amen keep doing the things
[1:03:43] amen that the word is telling you to do
[1:03:46] the things that we have been taught to
[1:03:47] do amen the things that you understand
[1:03:50] to do by revelation and everything
[1:03:53] you're gonna be all right man
[1:03:57] if you see these things as a move of god
[1:03:59] amen
[1:04:00] it make it easier to come out the church
[1:04:02] man
[1:04:03] because see if you're just coming
[1:04:04] because man told you to come if you're
[1:04:06] just coming because you like brother
[1:04:07] simmons and brother simmons look like he
[1:04:09] preached hard and he act like he know
[1:04:10] what he talking about you ain't gonna
[1:04:12] make it very far like that amen
[1:04:14] you gonna struggle amen you know one day
[1:04:17] he gonna say something that step on your
[1:04:18] toes a little bit too much the wrong way
[1:04:21] and it's gonna hurt people's feelings
[1:04:22] and they go a different direction amen
[1:04:26] you know if it's only a move a man to
[1:04:28] you then it it it's hard to change how
[1:04:31] you dress amen
[1:04:32] if it's only a move a man to you it's
[1:04:35] hard to
[1:04:36] change the things that you believe in
[1:04:38] amen but when you see it as a move of
[1:04:42] god amen
[1:04:43] it allows you to dedicate your entire
[1:04:46] life towards the thing
[1:04:49] now they asked jesus a great question
[1:04:52] about the authority that he was
[1:04:53] operating on the amen and that's good
[1:04:56] for us to have understanding about
[1:04:58] authority amen
[1:05:01] we operate under authority
[1:05:05] and see if we know what authority that
[1:05:07] we operate under and if we understand
[1:05:09] the authority that he operated under
[1:05:12] then that's going to allow us to
[1:05:14] exercise a certain amount of power even
[1:05:17] while we walked this earth
[1:05:19] hear these great scholars they they knew
[1:05:21] things about authority but they had no
[1:05:22] clue what authority christ jesus was
[1:05:24] operating on them
[1:05:26] the authority that we operate under
[1:05:29] means the same things that jesus christ
[1:05:33] has access to
[1:05:34] you got access to that as well amen
[1:05:36] book of romans the 8th chapter amen it
[1:05:38] talks about how we are heir of god heirs
[1:05:41] of god h-e-i-r-s we're heirs of god amen
[1:05:44] and then it turns around and it says
[1:05:46] that we are joint heirs with christ
[1:05:48] what that is saying is that everything
[1:05:50] that almighty god has you have inherited
[1:05:53] it because you're a part of his
[1:05:55] bloodline you're one of his heirs amen
[1:05:58] if you are a joint heir with christ
[1:06:00] everything that jesus christ has now
[1:06:02] this is a big statement it's easy for us
[1:06:04] to say this thing and say oh yeah that
[1:06:05] sounds real good brother maurice but
[1:06:07] when you stop and think i'm a joint heir
[1:06:10] with jesus christ that means that
[1:06:13] everything that jesus christ has access
[1:06:15] to
[1:06:16] i got full access to that same thing
[1:06:19] so when jesus christ comes on the scene
[1:06:21] and says father i know that you hear me
[1:06:24] always
[1:06:26] and if i'm telling you that you are
[1:06:27] joint error twice that means that you
[1:06:30] can have that same testimony tonight
[1:06:33] when you pray to almighty god you can
[1:06:36] approach them saying father i know that
[1:06:39] you hear me always
[1:06:42] you know when you operate under
[1:06:44] authority amen the authority of the
[1:06:47] scripture we can use that to say buying
[1:06:50] strikes we are healed amen
[1:06:52] because we know whose authority we are
[1:06:55] operating under
[1:06:58] that this authority it allows us amen
[1:07:01] when we say he will keep us in perfect
[1:07:04] peace amen
[1:07:07] because we keep that mind stayed on him
[1:07:10] hallelujah
[1:07:13] in an age of great distractions in an
[1:07:15] age where so much is going on you can
[1:07:18] take back your peace from the devil god
[1:07:22] has given you back authority over your
[1:07:25] mind and over your mind battles amen
[1:07:27] because he's in the authority giving
[1:07:29] business
[1:07:31] he's placed all of the things of the
[1:07:34] enemy
[1:07:35] underneath his feet amen
[1:07:37] the authority that we have saints
[1:07:40] it fixes families back again amen the
[1:07:44] authority that we have it makes demons
[1:07:47] trembling amen the authority that we
[1:07:50] have
[1:07:51] it causes us to walk differently from
[1:07:54] the rest of the world amen the authority
[1:07:57] that we have it allows us to call those
[1:08:00] things that are not as though they were
[1:08:03] it allows us to speak life in all types
[1:08:06] of situations amen
[1:08:09] because we operating under authority
[1:08:12] you know when you come out under
[1:08:14] authority against the devil you don't
[1:08:16] got the back of it man
[1:08:18] and it's not about you doing it on your
[1:08:20] own it's not about you covering it up
[1:08:23] but it's about the one that gave you the
[1:08:25] authority man
[1:08:26] and when almighty god gives you the
[1:08:29] authority you don't have to back up from
[1:08:31] any situation hallelujah
[1:08:34] when jesus christ was exercising his
[1:08:37] authority amen and we joined ezra christ
[1:08:40] he said i got the keys of justin hill
[1:08:45] now there's a lot of things people got
[1:08:47] keys for you man there's a lot of things
[1:08:49] it'd be nice to have keys to that new
[1:08:51] half a million dollar house amen up
[1:08:53] there in northeast columbia man it's one
[1:08:56] thing to have keys to one of them nice
[1:08:58] porsches that's out there on the lot
[1:09:00] but all of those keys will fail in
[1:09:03] comparison
[1:09:04] to you having the key to the thing that
[1:09:08] has
[1:09:09] affected mankind all the way from adam
[1:09:12] down through eve amen
[1:09:15] that's affecting man amen no matter how
[1:09:17] holy paul lived amen one day paul still
[1:09:20] had to die no matter how good david was
[1:09:23] and how he had a heart after god's own
[1:09:25] heart david still had to die man abraham
[1:09:28] still had to die even though he gave up
[1:09:30] everything that he had to walk with god
[1:09:33] he still had to die job lost everything
[1:09:35] that he had was brought all the way down
[1:09:38] raised all the way back up but he still
[1:09:40] had to die one day but jesus christ
[1:09:43] being on the scene and you being joint
[1:09:46] ezra christ lets us know you even got
[1:09:48] the keys to death and hell amen
[1:09:53] hallelujah according to god amen
[1:09:56] you got the key to them
[1:09:58] so we know as believers they mean death
[1:10:01] is just a tool
[1:10:02] for us to get ushered into that presence
[1:10:04] of god amen
[1:10:06] and the bible lets us know amen there's
[1:10:08] a shout out voice and trump going forth
[1:10:10] and one day the whole day of christ
[1:10:11] gonna rise amen and we gonna see them
[1:10:14] right here with us amen and all of us
[1:10:15] gonna be caught up together and that's
[1:10:17] what the bible teaches us amen
[1:10:20] we got the keys to it amen
[1:10:23] everybody is not blessed with that
[1:10:24] authority everybody is not blessed to
[1:10:27] know that authority amen but god has
[1:10:30] blessed you with it amen he's allow you
[1:10:32] to be able to see it a minute and go
[1:10:34] forth
[1:10:38] everybody can't recognize the move of
[1:10:40] god amen
[1:10:41] because it takes a special people to be
[1:10:43] able to recognize the move of god we
[1:10:44] surely see that by now even
[1:10:47] no matter how much you could break it
[1:10:48] down to somebody teach it try to try to
[1:10:51] piece meal spoon feed it explain today
[1:10:53] man
[1:10:54] if god don't have that seed within you
[1:10:56] from before the foundation in the world
[1:10:58] it's just gonna be like you trying to
[1:11:00] learn arabic a minute it's a confusing
[1:11:02] language it's hard to figure out the
[1:11:03] characters is backwards the forwards
[1:11:05] they mean there's little squiggles not
[1:11:06] even letters they man it just or it's a
[1:11:09] foreign language to you amen
[1:11:12] so it takes a special people to be able
[1:11:15] to recognize the move of god amen
[1:11:17] because everybody cannot see him amen
[1:11:21] everybody can't see him moving it see
[1:11:23] him operating him and like i said with
[1:11:25] abel and kane i mean you got to see him
[1:11:27] by revelation of it
[1:11:29] same thing with jacob and he saw him man
[1:11:31] as shyster as jacob was
[1:11:33] jacob had an understanding that there
[1:11:36] was a certain inheritance that was
[1:11:37] coming forth amen that there was a
[1:11:39] birthright
[1:11:40] and even though he might not have been
[1:11:42] as good of a man as esau was he
[1:11:44] recognized what that birthright was and
[1:11:46] he wanted a piece of that amen
[1:11:50] as good of a man as he saw was he didn't
[1:11:52] steal the birthright for an alley it
[1:11:54] wasn't that big of a deal to him
[1:11:57] okay my daddy is isaac so what
[1:11:59] my granddaddy is abraham so what amen
[1:12:02] your seed is gonna be more than the
[1:12:04] stars of the sky more than the sands of
[1:12:06] the seashore and then he will all the
[1:12:07] nations of the earth will be blessed
[1:12:09] okay i guess
[1:12:11] he didn't esteem the promises of
[1:12:13] almighty god very highly in it
[1:12:17] but it takes something within you
[1:12:20] to be able to see him
[1:12:23] see how he's moving
[1:12:25] see what he's doing
[1:12:27] and be able to take that and go in the
[1:12:30] right direction but everybody can't see
[1:12:32] it amen
[1:12:33] the bible lets us know it's gonna be man
[1:12:34] that take the mark of the beast amen
[1:12:36] whether you small great rich poor they
[1:12:38] don't have a revelation
[1:12:40] to take the seal of god amen
[1:12:42] but god has blessed you to be able to
[1:12:44] see him amen what a silly god ain't not
[1:12:46] but the holy ghost amen
[1:12:47] that spirit of god within you the new
[1:12:50] birth within you manifest itself so you
[1:12:52] can understand so you could see the
[1:12:54] kingdom of god amen he said except man
[1:12:56] be born again you can't even see the
[1:12:59] kingdom of god prophet god told us he
[1:13:01] means understanding we
[1:13:05] in a time where the rest of the world
[1:13:07] will go the other direction amen
[1:13:10] and sometimes even the church world
[1:13:12] itself will go the other direction
[1:13:14] because they cannot recognize the move
[1:13:15] of god amen
[1:13:17] god has blessed some people amen
[1:13:20] that be able to see him by revelation of
[1:13:22] it
[1:13:23] and when you come to them and you say
[1:13:25] well well well you know maybe you was
[1:13:27] baptizing father son holy ghost but i
[1:13:29] can show you in acts 2 38 about this
[1:13:31] name of the lord jesus christ amen if
[1:13:33] you could see that and go in it it shows
[1:13:36] you that you have a revelation that we
[1:13:39] are moving by the things of god amen
[1:13:44] the ones that see him they see him by
[1:13:46] revelation
[1:13:48] and they'll be able to catch a hold to
[1:13:51] what is going on
[1:13:53] god has blessed you with something you
[1:13:54] can catch a hold to what is going on and
[1:13:58] maybe man might will say well these
[1:14:00] sisters wearing these little skirts and
[1:14:02] dress and thing they ain't nothing but a
[1:14:04] movie man but i could point you in the
[1:14:06] bible where it got to be a move of god
[1:14:09] because god says it's abomination
[1:14:12] amen for a woman to put on that which
[1:14:15] pertaining from to a man
[1:14:17] and people forget for also for a man to
[1:14:20] put on a woman's garment because god
[1:14:21] knows we got plenty of that nowadays
[1:14:24] and that's all go back and forth on both
[1:14:27] sides
[1:14:28] so people look at you and look at how
[1:14:30] you carry yourself and say well that's a
[1:14:32] movement man well i can show you how
[1:14:34] it's a move of god amen somebody might
[1:14:37] say well well this woman that got this
[1:14:38] great gift god let her preach amen
[1:14:41] that's a movement man the move of god
[1:14:43] lets me know amen i suffer not a woman
[1:14:46] to preach or suffer authority over the
[1:14:48] man amen
[1:14:50] when a move a man might say well it
[1:14:51] don't matter what you do and it don't
[1:14:53] matter if you come to church or you
[1:14:55] don't come to church a movie god said
[1:14:58] keep pressing towards the mark amen the
[1:15:00] move of god will remind you to be ye
[1:15:03] perfect even as my father in heaven is
[1:15:06] perfect amen what you have to do get
[1:15:09] your eyes off yourself
[1:15:11] get your eyes off of other people's
[1:15:13] opinions because there's only one
[1:15:16] opinion that matters even
[1:15:19] hallelujah
[1:15:22] we drawn to a close i mean we will keep
[1:15:24] you all night
[1:15:25] see sometimes people draw back from the
[1:15:27] move of god because sometimes moving in
[1:15:30] the things of all body god it could be a
[1:15:33] very tough way
[1:15:35] ain't no way i could sugarcoat that
[1:15:37] sometimes you're going to look different
[1:15:38] from everybody else sometimes you're
[1:15:40] going to be go you're going to be you're
[1:15:41] going to be going to church a lot more
[1:15:43] often than a lot of other people amen
[1:15:46] you're going to be buried in the word
[1:15:48] and sometimes that thing make people
[1:15:49] draw back
[1:15:50] man sometimes you have to give up things
[1:15:56] and you might not understand the thing
[1:15:59] that you've given up at the time
[1:16:02] i ain't talking about simple things like
[1:16:03] alcohol and smoking amen but sometimes
[1:16:05] you know you might think that this is
[1:16:06] the job i need to take out this is the
[1:16:08] pathway that i need to go in
[1:16:10] and god because he wants you moving in
[1:16:12] his direction he he steers you and
[1:16:14] guides you back by the tender hand of
[1:16:16] jehovah
[1:16:19] see sometimes the the move of god
[1:16:23] it ain't necessarily boom boom boom boom
[1:16:25] boom overnight
[1:16:27] but sometimes god he moves with a slow
[1:16:30] process amen
[1:16:32] god's time is so much different from our
[1:16:35] time
[1:16:36] and in our world and in our society we
[1:16:39] wanted it done five minutes ago
[1:16:41] and god said i might take 15 years for
[1:16:44] it to come to pass
[1:16:48] the bible lets us know about a young man
[1:16:50] named joseph amen
[1:16:52] and you think about that story of joseph
[1:16:54] how he was all the way down within the
[1:16:57] pit
[1:16:58] put in the pit by his own brothers get
[1:17:02] out of the pit
[1:17:03] get into egypt get in the potiphar's
[1:17:06] house think he's doing all right because
[1:17:09] him being a child of god everything in
[1:17:12] part of his house being blessed because
[1:17:15] joseph is there
[1:17:17] but god got long-term plans and he said
[1:17:20] joseph your spot ain't just to get up in
[1:17:23] potiphar's house i still got a lot more
[1:17:25] for you to do it
[1:17:27] so now when joseph gets falsely accused
[1:17:31] put in the jail it seemed like he all
[1:17:33] the way back past square one he even
[1:17:36] worse than he was in when he was in the
[1:17:38] pit
[1:17:39] thinking he gonna get out of jail and
[1:17:41] the man that's gonna get him out of jail
[1:17:43] still forget about him again
[1:17:46] but because the plan of god is long term
[1:17:50] that man might have forgot about joseph
[1:17:52] being in jail hallelujah going to god
[1:17:55] but i tell you who didn't forget about
[1:17:57] joseph being in jail
[1:17:59] almighty god never forgot about him
[1:18:01] saints
[1:18:03] almighty god knew the thing that he was
[1:18:06] going through i imagine it was many a
[1:18:08] night joseph was sitting in that jail
[1:18:10] cell and thinking man i ain't never even
[1:18:12] did nothing wrong
[1:18:14] and one day to turn to a week a week to
[1:18:17] turn to a month monster started turning
[1:18:20] the years and all i was doing from the
[1:18:22] beginning was trying to be a child
[1:18:24] within my father's house
[1:18:27] and here i find myself in jail but we
[1:18:30] understand when god is moving
[1:18:33] sometimes he take his time
[1:18:36] but what you see in the end result is
[1:18:38] that he get exalted hallelujah
[1:18:42] all the way up to the right hand with
[1:18:44] pharaoh
[1:18:45] and not just resulted to be a figurehead
[1:18:49] but he gets positionally placed so that
[1:18:52] he can be a great blessing to his people
[1:18:56] in their greatest harmony
[1:19:00] sometimes we don't understand the
[1:19:02] long-term process of god
[1:19:05] we don't understand why we had to take
[1:19:07] that knife straight into the back of it
[1:19:09] because joseph got backstabbed not just
[1:19:11] one time but it was more than one time
[1:19:13] hallelujah we don't understand why we
[1:19:16] got to go down into the pit where we got
[1:19:18] to fight the mind battles why we got to
[1:19:21] go through these different things but
[1:19:22] the plan of god is long term if you are
[1:19:26] an adopted son of god you are going to
[1:19:28] go into the position that he has placed
[1:19:31] you within and the position that he's
[1:19:34] placed with it it is a perfect position
[1:19:37] and it won't just be a blessing to you
[1:19:39] but it'll be something that all the
[1:19:40] families of earth will be blessed and
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] because you are a child of the wrong
[1:19:45] seed of abraham
[1:19:47] and just by you showing up there's gonna
[1:19:49] be a blessing hallelujah
[1:19:54] it might be some trouble
[1:19:56] but god will exalt you in due time amen
[1:20:00] all the great characters are in the
[1:20:01] bible amen they moved in the move of god
[1:20:04] it was up and down but god took care of
[1:20:06] him amen
[1:20:08] hallelujah amen
[1:20:11] you know when you look at the story of
[1:20:12] moses and how he was born into the
[1:20:14] family that he was born into
[1:20:16] but god knew that those people needed a
[1:20:20] deliverer
[1:20:21] and he allah it said like the devil said
[1:20:24] but i got him now i'm gonna have all the
[1:20:26] kids be killed off
[1:20:28] guys i got something i pull out my back
[1:20:30] pocket
[1:20:31] imma let him be raised up in pharaoh's
[1:20:34] own household
[1:20:36] the plan of god
[1:20:38] is so different it's so long turned to
[1:20:41] anything that we can conceive as humans
[1:20:44] amen
[1:20:45] the plan of god how you allow roof
[1:20:48] to be a moabitess
[1:20:50] and seemingly she would have just stayed
[1:20:51] in her homeland found another husband
[1:20:54] and been all right the guy said no my
[1:20:56] plans are so long term my plans are so
[1:20:58] different something stood up within her
[1:21:01] a move a man would have been for ruth to
[1:21:03] just stay in her homeland say what was
[1:21:05] going on but you know she saw god in her
[1:21:08] mother-in-law naomi
[1:21:10] she heard the stories about how there
[1:21:12] was a god in israel and she said you
[1:21:14] know
[1:21:15] i want to see something about that same
[1:21:17] god
[1:21:19] asian naomi tell them a roof you stay
[1:21:21] with your homeland rule said no
[1:21:24] where you go i'll go amen
[1:21:26] hallelujah amen
[1:21:28] your god will be my god amen
[1:21:30] your people are be my people when you
[1:21:33] die i'll die and you know god being a
[1:21:36] rewarder of faith god said i can work
[1:21:39] with a faith like that amen
[1:21:42] and you know maybe ruth didn't even
[1:21:44] understand why she was gonna go all the
[1:21:46] way but naomi like that
[1:21:48] but god knew the whole time
[1:21:50] that in the land of israel there was a
[1:21:53] kinsmen redeemer by the name of a boy
[1:21:56] and this brother by the name of boaz he
[1:21:58] had more than enough power to redeem
[1:22:01] each and everything that roof had
[1:22:03] already lost amen to roof went from just
[1:22:06] gleaning in the fields because maybe
[1:22:08] somebody thought okay well she got into
[1:22:10] israel and god blessed him about her
[1:22:11] being able to glean the little stuff
[1:22:13] that's left in the field no roof on the
[1:22:15] whole field
[1:22:18] she had to clean no more that time was
[1:22:20] up
[1:22:21] she was married to the man that on the
[1:22:23] field saint
[1:22:24] hallelujah
[1:22:29] our time for gleaning is over
[1:22:32] we are married to the one that owns the
[1:22:36] feeling man
[1:22:38] roof ain't getting overnight it was a
[1:22:40] long process for ruth to get there but
[1:22:43] when she got there her bloodline ran all
[1:22:46] the way down amen to jesus christ amen
[1:22:49] all the way down through joseph they
[1:22:51] could trace back the bloodline again
[1:22:52] because god's plan is long term
[1:22:56] when god has blessed you amen to to be
[1:22:58] able to recognize him amen
[1:23:01] and being able to recognize his move
[1:23:02] says that's a great blessing
[1:23:05] don't don't be put up by people point
[1:23:07] for what that's man doing and man said
[1:23:10] that a man said that no we line up with
[1:23:12] the scripture
[1:23:14] and the scripture shows us that it's a
[1:23:16] move of god amen
[1:23:18] and anytime you're moving with the
[1:23:20] things of god he is rewarded those
[1:23:22] people amen

[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:54] when i rose this morning
[1:28:57] i didn't have no doubt
[1:29:00] i knew that the lord would bring me out
[1:29:04] oh when i got down on my knees i said
[1:29:08] lord help me please and i gotta sing and
[1:29:12] shout at victory
[1:29:15] victoria's victory is my oh victory
[1:29:21] i know of victory today
[1:29:25] well i told satan
[1:29:28] god bless you saints
[1:29:44] hey man you appreciate the word tonight
[1:29:53] amen
[1:29:54] what we need more than anything is
[1:29:56] spiritual discernment how many believe
[1:29:57] that tonight
[1:29:59] you know i was ministering on sunday on
[1:30:01] i am
[1:30:02] showing how god
[1:30:04] you know he's identified by his
[1:30:06] characteristics
[1:30:07] and when he first declared what his name
[1:30:09] was he said i am
[1:30:12] so what he was what he was about to show
[1:30:14] them
[1:30:16] he would be throughout all time
[1:30:18] the healing the signs the wonders
[1:30:21] come on
[1:30:22] he says i am
[1:30:25] and and what he was like said what he
[1:30:27] was gonna show them he would always be
[1:30:29] and so that's why
[1:30:31] many times in the scriptures i looked at
[1:30:32] how gideon when the angel came to him he
[1:30:36] said well
[1:30:37] if god be with us then then where is all
[1:30:39] his miracles
[1:30:40] come on
[1:30:42] we said is it of god or is it a man
[1:30:44] if it's of god we know his
[1:30:46] characteristics
[1:30:48] then we know that these signs shall
[1:30:49] follow what them that believe
[1:30:52] so if it's of god and where is the
[1:30:53] supernatural
[1:30:55] it can't be of god without the
[1:30:56] supernatural
[1:30:58] how many believe that tonight
[1:31:00] but that's what it takes i believe the
[1:31:03] only way we're going to not be deceived
[1:31:04] is going to have to be the holy ghost
[1:31:07] in us
[1:31:08] leading us and guiding us
[1:31:10] you know he says the holy ghost when he
[1:31:12] come he was going to teach us all things
[1:31:14] come on
[1:31:15] and i believe that i depend on that
[1:31:18] because i know that in this world so
[1:31:20] dark and like the brother i'm already
[1:31:22] saying night so deceptive there's no way
[1:31:24] that we'll be able to find our way
[1:31:27] the only way we'll be to find our way is
[1:31:28] god is going to have to take us by hand
[1:31:31] i like that scripture how jesus talked
[1:31:33] about the good shepherd he said he said
[1:31:35] that he stands at the door come on
[1:31:38] and he says that he knows all the sheep
[1:31:40] by name
[1:31:42] that's the good shepherd said he called
[1:31:44] them and he leadeth them out come on
[1:31:47] i said did you hear the call tonight
[1:31:49] well if you heard the call you don't
[1:31:50] have to go on your own
[1:31:52] god is going to lead you out how many
[1:31:54] believe that tonight but what it takes
[1:31:56] is it of god like you said or is it a
[1:31:58] man you know i was saying the other day
[1:32:01] what it is i like how brother maurice is
[1:32:03] bringing out but you got to have a
[1:32:04] personal experience
[1:32:06] i says what it is as an individual
[1:32:09] you know just hearing the word or just
[1:32:11] saying i believe ain't enough
[1:32:13] because when storms come trials
[1:32:15] tribulations things hit your life you
[1:32:18] got nothing to anchor you
[1:32:20] but you need a personal experience i
[1:32:22] said what it is i've been praying i said
[1:32:24] god you got to do something supernatural
[1:32:27] in individuals lives
[1:32:29] i thought about moses in the burning
[1:32:31] bush i thought about paul seeing the
[1:32:32] light i thought about so many ways what
[1:32:35] it was
[1:32:36] one day
[1:32:37] god showed up didn't he
[1:32:39] that woman at the well he showed up
[1:32:41] didn't he
[1:32:42] and he did something supernatural
[1:32:45] that when they caught hold to it their
[1:32:47] lives were never the same
[1:32:49] nobody could talk them out of it nobody
[1:32:51] could shake them away from it
[1:32:53] because they were anchored
[1:32:55] not in just uh like to say the letter
[1:32:57] killeth but they had the spirit
[1:33:00] that came
[1:33:01] and it quickened the word come on and it
[1:33:03] brought the life so it's no longer that
[1:33:06] they were just reading the word the
[1:33:08] letter of the word but the life of the
[1:33:11] word had come now
[1:33:12] so when they read it it's something
[1:33:15] about the life of it now came and then
[1:33:18] you know it was a change then and i
[1:33:20] believe that with all of my heart and i
[1:33:22] pray that even today for our young
[1:33:25] people for our children all what it is
[1:33:28] we can preach the word but i said god
[1:33:30] you got to do something supernatural for
[1:33:32] him
[1:33:32] you got to come down i said god do what
[1:33:35] you always done if god be with us then
[1:33:38] where are all his miracles
[1:33:39] god you know we we know we know what
[1:33:41] you're capable of lord
[1:33:43] and we won't rest until we we get what
[1:33:46] you what you're capable of how many want
[1:33:48] to do that tonight how many believe that
[1:33:49] tonight
[1:33:50] amen so and that's what it is we don't
[1:33:53] just warm by painted fire and all those
[1:33:55] things but we look for god to do
[1:33:57] supernatural things
[1:33:59] you know we look for him to be who he
[1:34:01] always was
[1:34:02] he said i am that that's who i am that's
[1:34:05] what my name is you tell him that i am
[1:34:07] come on i like how in revelation he said
[1:34:09] he that was and which is and which is to
[1:34:11] come come on the almighty the alpha and
[1:34:14] omega the first and the last come on god
[1:34:16] don't change i know that the world is is
[1:34:19] the way it is now and like he says in
[1:34:21] this age we got to live by faith and all
[1:34:23] those things but you know one thing
[1:34:25] about god god don't change come on
[1:34:28] nothing can't stop god from when god
[1:34:30] want to move
[1:34:31] when god want to heal nothing can't stop
[1:34:33] god from healing when god want to save
[1:34:36] nothing can't stop god from saving god
[1:34:38] can do whatever he wants whenever he
[1:34:40] wants but y'all believe that tonight so
[1:34:42] i'm stirred are you stirred tonight amen
[1:34:45] let's preach let's get a lord hand
[1:34:46] clapper praise amen
[1:34:49] come on
[1:34:52] is it of god or is it a man
[1:34:54] let us bow our heads once again
[1:34:57] heavenly father
[1:34:58] lord we thank you tonight
[1:35:00] for your grace lord and
[1:35:02] using our brother maurice lord

[1:35:08] so many things that were said lord

[1:35:15] things and she pondered them in her
[1:35:17] heart

[1:35:20] word lord
[1:35:22] and that it had fallen on good ground
[1:35:24] and god we could take it home and ponder

[1:35:41] thing bless your children here tonight

[1:35:45] your presence i pray that the angels of
[1:35:47] god might go in front of us lord and god
[1:35:50] that your anointing your quickening
[1:35:52] power might keep us in the way father
