Mullen family God Predator helped him and strengthen them and comfort them in the name of Jesus Christ Lord God I prayed this morning God that your spirit will move here today oh God that if you're not pouring of the Holy Ghost Lord God that you would try to hand to heal and to live off set free by the power of the Holy Ghost In The Name of Jesus Christ father we thank you now commit the service in the word of Grace into your hand do you for your blessings upon your children in your word in Jesus name amen as we look at the Romans 12 um servant of God says trying to do God a service without it being his will amen trying to do God of service without it being this will I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of God may God bless you read his words you may be seated see I I like what he says you know we can try to do God a service without it being his will but we want to know God I want to be how about you brother and sister do you want to be in his perfect will amen see sometimes you know we have a will but God has a will and and we got to make our decision Lord I want to be in your perfect will amen because I know amen God has a perfect will for my life and I don't want to be in the permission will but I want to be in the perfect will of God now you know I I got to keep saying this because it's done in prayer it seemed like you know it's just sometimes you have certain trademarks and um I I was thinking on that what we want we we don't need and what we need we don't want and and that's when we when we talk about Dodge perfect we are what we what we want we don't need and what we need we don't want him but the Bible says but God would supply all of our needs according to his riches in glory as we think about God's uh will for our lives let's think about you know God am I interested see because a lot of times we're not interested in God's perfect will or God will for our lives at all see because we don't have God in our plan and and our intentions our intent but the Bible said the word of God is a quick power sharpening into his sword and those you know even to the zone of thoughts in the tents of the heart and and so forth I know it says cuts to the joints in the marrow amen and so forth but I'm not trying to quote it right now I'm just trying to get to it knows the intents of our hearts see because God knows that the intent of our hearts the word of God discerns the intent of our heart and because our heart uh uh it's not on God how hard in our minds is not to please God and if our hearts and our minds are not to please God then the Bible said we'll be plea we want to please ourselves are you whooping so are you interested in pleasing God are you pleasing yourself now let's just just mind you when you please yourself it's only going to be for a season but what God will he's not willing that he should perish but all should come to repentance amen so God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life God wants you to live amen but we understand that if we're not focused if we're not focused you know it's it takes God to give us Focus because if our minds just out there somewhere you know I I know I'm in church and I know I I I I'm here in this earth and in this world but I I don't have a purpose and I don't you know I'm just moving through here and just doing what I want to do but you got to find out God what is your perfect will it's a lot of people go to church and then their intense is that I'm going through my uh a form of godliness I'm going through worship I'm going through church because this is what I I supposed to do but I'm not I I'm not gonna let God Amen control my life it's not that there's intending to say I'm not letting God control my life I'm doing what I feel led to do you know the prophet was talking about um David had good intents and who wanted to bring not back to Israel and so forth as it was taken away in the days of Saul and so forth and they lost the ark and all but they wanted to bring the art back the word back wanted to bring Revival back and that was a good intent but they bought it back on Arch car and and it wasn't supposed to be bought back that way it was supposed to be bad on the shoulders of men are you with me and so um in the in that caught the the ark began to shake and the man put forth his hand and he fell dead for touching see what I'm saying is that our intentions might be good and said what David did he didn't he didn't consult Nathan the prophet and we need to construct God on our actions we don't consult God I remember the time people were really pray and ask God shall I do this until I do that and then sometimes they'll back it up ask the preachers do you need me is it all right they don't care about the preach they don't care nothing about God I'm gonna tell you something how you treat one another that's how you treat God how you treat the preacher that's that's how you pre-treat God don't you got a relationship with God you have respect for one another if you ain't got no relationship with God you don't care how you treat other people you're interested in yourself are you a man yo I don't care how spiritual you think y'all but if you don't have uh uh a relationship with God in a in an intimate way you don't care about nobody but yourself very selfish but when you got a relationship with God you care about others amen you live your life amen for others you don't live your life for yourself are you with me but sometimes we're so involved with our wants that we don't even see our needs we're so involved in what we want to it's never God you know sometimes we don't say Our Father prayer Our Father which on heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom Come Thou oh no no no no I don't even say that prayer no more it's too traditional you know sometimes I you know I find myself Our Father which are in heaven I love you that day you know what I'm saying and then I think about thy will be done I want your will to be done in my life do you really want God's will to be done no no because I already doing you know sometimes everything that looks like a blessing may not be a blessing somebody might say I want to lay a million dollars before you and you must get in the shot thank god oh it's a blessing don't you think the game is godliness everything that looks like a blessing everything's shining ain't gold and everything that amen that that is laid before you and and sometimes amen things that are available to you I had many opportunities in life you know and a lot of times it was Grand opportunities opportunities to be you know multi-millionaires and all of that kind of stuff and he said well why do you take it if I over I had the opportunity I was a ticket is that the will of God will this bring you into bondage you know you you feel like God I can't take this oftentimes talk about the church done in Louisiana the pastor cried because I wouldn't take it I had 500 anyway for 500 to a thousand people the half white and half black church and I you know he said anything you want just let me know you want to fly home you need this whatever we'll take care anything you want but God told me to give you this church oh God so and when I didn't take it him and his wife started crying I didn't know he was sick and and he felt like God sent me to take it and I wouldn't take him I know a friend of mine a brother he bought me back in the time when the Lancers it was was you know the big car the thing about me one of those big lankas and said it's yours I said I don't want to take you back I didn't want to see him riding in one of those things because I would have been a big time preacher had a big image see sometimes everything that looked like a blessing you got to know that God got a plan and a will for your life you can take the big things and the high road and look good and everybody patting you on the back and oh you thinking something amen going places you know what I'm saying it see sometimes we we think that we're God is blessing oh Look What the Lord blessed me with oh Lord people are shouting on the wrong thing they look at the outside but they don't see the inside amen what is God what are you Discerning would this thing bring you closer to God sometimes it's the things they man that God want to bring you in a closer relationship with him but you don't you sometimes you know you struggle and you battle because you just want to do you just want to live I mean it's time out for just a living it's time to seek God's will for your life it's time out you should go come to church and think you go through the motions amen it's time out just going through the motions coming to church you need to find out God what is your will for me amen it's time amen that we find out that God has a plan in the backwards and God I want to know you it's time to know God there's too many times people get way up the road and they fail to know God but I want to know you God I want to know you and I want to I want God to speak to him I want to hear your voice I want to know you're talking to me amen I'm not just coming to church reveal yourself to me Lord Show Me Your Glory I want to know him see we we just go through the motion then we all religious I mean all religions we think that we we we think that we we got it we got it made it's a religious spirit that has people trapped amen I remember times brother came to me he says and he said pastor I want to pay your way to Jerusalem huh and I you know I'm going to Jerusalem and I want to get to a ticket and I want to I want you to go to Jerusalem and I want to pay for it I ain't interested and about a year later he came back again said I'm going back to the rules and I want to pay your ticket I want to play your way you see what I'm saying but you know we get opportunities in life and every time it's a door white wide open we chop in it everything that looks good we're Chum in it but we don't pray about it that God is your will you know everybody everybody tell me you know come back from Jerusalem or you don't know what you miss know what you miss and I said oh boy maybe I should have took one of those trips now it's gonna cause me then maybe I don't know how many thousands of dollars to take I mean back then it probably just for four or five thousand but now it's probably about 10. but here we we jump into opportunities we jump into things Without Really seeking God really die now now I'm gonna tell you something like I tell uh uh all the time if it's the will of God it's going to be a hard thing sometimes God Amen because it ain't gonna be something the flesh wants it won't be something your flesh is designed if it's God's Will and God's purpose and God's plan it's going something that's going to come against the grain the bishop used to say any dead fish can go with the current but it takes a lot of fish to go against the current are you up man and and that's what it is it's going to take a lot somebody that's got some life in them so some power him the god gets the current that's why I said don't be conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind let's go take somebody with some holy ghosts but God gets the grain to not to be conformed to this world it's going to take something in the inside it's going to take a God that's in the inside it's going to take the power of God for you to go against the grave it's going to take the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost you ain't going to be able to go against this world he said be not conformed to this world but be your transformed by the renewing of your mind amen it takes the Holy Ghost the transform us because Satan is a deformer and he would deform you and he would conform you and to this world and we know that all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life are you a man what Satan is offering you you're going to glorify you it won't glorify God it's going to please your flesh it's not going to please God when it comes down to pleasing God is something on the inside Hallelujah you say God get all the glory out of this you won't even know it sometimes it meant to ask what they know because God got the glory you won't even know what he's done until it's all over praise God you've gone down the road a little bit and then after you get down the road thinking that you fail with God your dad was my plan that was my will praise God I took you through this and back that I might bring you to your blessings glory to God imma bring you to a place that you can experience my power glory to God I want you to experience my glory glory to God I want you to know what it's like to be lifted up praise God hallelujah after you've been through something hey God job Prophet didn't know what it was all over praise God that it was in the plan of God and the will of God for him to serve a little while come on praise God God was making him more than him Hallelujah there was something coming out God is molding character in each and every one of us they not do the things that we go to God is bringing us through amen the statue of a perfect man bringing us to that more than character but sometimes because we got a plan for our lives let me go to Ephesians I was going to go back then Samuel talks about the people said they want a king but they feed them one God bless you amen the people told Samuel because you Eli and and the first Samuel ate Eli's son wasn't living right wasn't doing right and Samuel had we got no and the people said to Samuel samya your sons ain't right and you all give us a king like we can be like all other nations are you up man you know the problem is I have trouble people amen want to be like everybody else oh this is how they do it over here in in the message that's how they do it over here in the denomination that's how they do it over here amen but you're individuals amen the Bible said Mark the what Mark the perfect man you're looking at Jesus you ain't looking at them your blessings don't come from the other people or from the outside where your percussions come from God you look to Jesus and said God you've got a plan for me this is an individual thing it ain't no group thing cause I'm in this particular church I'm in Broad Tabernacle I'm in the message I'm in this no no no it's you as an individual are you up man God wants to use you as an individual God wants to deal with you as an individual but you know I I was saying the sister Hannah I said people don't want to pray the Christ but they want the results that they used to have amen but they don't want to do what they used to do amen for the results that they used to have and see people are lying to themselves and saying that I'm where I used to be and I'm where I I I you know you want God to do what he used to do in your life but you ain't here you're not willing to do what you used to do praise God folks say well I want all the churches to come back and we have this Holy Ghost Revival and see the glory of God like and you send to pilify come down like it used to do uh you know I talked to one Pastor talked to another one talk to the streets and the people and some of them actually and they said oh I can remember the time when the glory of God was so thick I said you know and I almost said Look Into You Russell Simmons can you bring it back amen I said well you know I said people want it back but do they want to do what they did then it took people looking for the coming of the lord they're all looking up thanking Jesus might come in any time now what people are crying out to God to Lord out of that oh you should have seen people you should have seen the attitude in the people now we can come together everybody come together to love one another if that's gonna bring God back if that don't bring the power of God back it's going to take somebody that's going to certain of us and you'll cry in God and really look for the coming of the Lord people who anticipating Jesus coming at any time now you you you go fooling yourself they they ain't really looking for Jesus to come in any time look at look at the condition of people amen if the world ain't coming in and things ain't happening people got their attention to focus on everything but the coming of the Lord but if they start looking up to Lord you can whoo I'm telling you something is happening something happening this is a brother Ernest said told me this morning he said brother Samuel you don't know but things are happening the sudden Baptist itself set down all the women pastors I said they ain't gonna have it no more and then he said that that was he said that was nice in the news I said he said uh he said something's happening in the spirit I said everything is shaking amen the church world is shaking the world is Shook Up everything that's gonna everything that can be shaken will be shaking only those things that cannot be shaken will remain amen brother and sister I'm telling you if you're not being shook amen just wait a little while you're gonna be sure amen and if you in that if you can't be shook you know you got an anchor amen you know you've got something down in the inside the king's your soul language the case man Hallelujah praise God you're gonna have to have a revelation on the inside I was telling Rachel the other day I said Rachel you got to have your own personal revelation praise God you can't go off on mine you can't go for the church you can't go off of the Prophet you got to have your own personal experience thank you Jesus amen we can talk about that he meant the prophet we can talk about the past we can talk about this and Mom and Daddy but God got to give you your own personality it's got to be you and God praise God is God dealing with you praise God God getting you ready and you have a revelation of Jesus Christ amen and you don't have that personal thing that's what I'm saying people turn their back when the preacher failed and the path to failed they turned it back on God amen amen people amen they start doing things that never did in their life because they're attraction in the church sometimes amen you know people can put out faults in me and you will find them only only one that they can't find no fault in is Jesus Christ are you up there you go through all the prophets in your fine forty and each and every one of them but in Jesus Christ we find no fault in the man are you with me that's the only one you find out for them praise God everybody else you can find food in praise God so if you bring a person to an image or a church or organizational the denomination he'll bring them into amen uh a man a prophet or a a preacher something said a Paul or something said Paul some says see for some say Amen Abraham something you know if you bring a person to brother Brandon you're going to find fault in him and when people find the fault in him everybody start leaving oh man and one person he wasn't perfect all the time are you up man oh he's saying this yeah he said that you said something too well you say what you did oh wait I'm so perfect but if you bring a person to a man and the man fell off amen they see the image of the man and they see something wrong with him then they gonna say oh but if you bring them to the word amen you can't find no fault in the world you'll break them to Jesus Christ amen Paul said follow me as I was amen praise God see the message is Jesus Christ amen the messenger is Christ and the message is Jesus Christ and he is the what the word are you with me so what happens amen you got to make sure that people have the relationship because they're never amen he's oh Lord let me go here in Ephesians but it's something that you got to be sealed praise God you're not just with the intellectual knowledge of of the message of the hour internet acknowledge Him amen God said a prophet you've got to be sealed you got to know God for yourself something got to get the I'm talking about God I'm not talking about no brother seven I'm not talking about knowing brother I'm talking about you no no you've got to know God time after all these folks talking about this and that I'm talking about God talking about his word amen you got to know God oh Lord I I don't want to sound like I'm fussing but you got to know God that's what's wrong with people amen amen the child ice cream and Holly yeah don't know God bump it up and down the prophet said to us and the church said that ah we standing for this went to a meeting in the other day amen the people preaching the their organization you know what I'm saying they preaching now you know you got to stay here yeah in this organization because this is the truth this is the word everybody believed that no matter what persuasion they have talk to the Jehovah Witness the other day and they they they got them straight they got their confidence into the street slave class so they get there information from their headquarters and they go out and they teach and try to stand for it amen but you got to have your own person you can't go to the street slave class headquarters you can't go get the profit from the grave and say this and that you got to have your own live in God inside you you're about to have the Holy Ghost for yourself you got to know God for yourself Jesus come back it ain't gonna be amen my pastor saying what about you do you have your own personal revelation or Jesus Christ what did God mean to you as an individual well I I'ma listen to my pastor I haven't listened to the price on you yes you and God that's God revealed himself to you as an individual well I spoke in tongues I shot it I believe God to the prophet yeah all of that's good isn't that right all of that's good but do you have a relationship with Jesus Christ do you know him I I know about him if God ever revealed himself to you as an individual and what grounds Are you standing

really crying now for help you may not need none but people are crying out for help people want something for God they don't sometimes they don't fully understand what they want but they want something for God they know it's more to what they have as a religion as church as God they want more and there's a deep call to the Deep then there is a deep to respond so if there's something that you're hungry and thirst after righteousness that you shall shall be filled praise God there's no question about it somebody's hungry somebody's thirsty and Lord help me to get to them those that's been crying out will you come help us right help me to get to him before it's too late I don't want that blood to be on my hand I want to share with them what God is revealing how we live in to keep them from receiving the mark of the Peace because surely it's setting in fast it's like a wildfire spread and people are being trapped inside in the Holiness Church in the Apostolic Church they want people to sign contracts contract sign or we you'll write sign contracts they're taking everything to to the law if you don't go that way excommunicated putting you out and they got the law to back them it's getting that way brother and sister don't be alarmed if he it's not at your door all these super Cathedrals and all listed people are doing don't be alarmed somebody don't come knocking on your door Brian Tabernacle you can form into the image of the Beast and if you don't receive them all shut your doors shut it up and if you don't have a revelation of Jesus Christ for yourself and understand where you live and the hour you're living in you said is the mark gonna help me it'll help you help you go to the Lake of Fire are you with me so folks will gladly receiving the mark because it don't look so close like God to if it be possible easy to see the very last are you with me but once you have a revelation of what it is you you say oh you know the Hebrew voice I burn but I won't bow to the image are you up man you I go in the fire before I take the byronize an image brother and sister if you don't know what damage is you're gonna buy a nine too because you don't even know what it is it's up to you and I the one people tell them but if you don't if you ain't certain for yourself how you gonna tell somebody well you don't know where you stand as an individual you walk with God you're not even Walking with God right your life is out of order you have no plans on total surrendering to God you don't have that in your mind you have your mind on the world and the things of the world brothers and sisters it's gonna be a time I gotta close but here Ephesians 1 and 9. he said have it Excuse me yes having made known unto us to what see God's will is a what mystery the will of God for your life is a mystery that got to be revealed to you as an individual Paul said when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb to reveal his what his son in me see it's got to be something that's revealed to you as an individual God revealed himself to you as an individual he he saw the light shine from heaven and he said who are thy Lord the Lord said I'm Jesus thank you Lord that's when God revealed himself to Paul Paul is saying that having made known unto us talking about you and I they didn't know to us the mystery amen of his will are you aren't you glad that God made known to you the mystery of his will amen according to his good pleasure amen it's good to me amen it's good pleasure which he had what purpose where and himself see his will is his word he said if you abide in me and my word abide in you you can ask what you will are you with me okay he said that in the dissensation of the what I said we have arrived the dissensation of the fullness of time I said time is winding up we're in the fullness of time now where time will be no longer he said to John seal up the same with the seven Thunders doesn't write them not amen amen why because in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he should began to sound the mission to God shall be finished amen he said time will be no longer are you with me so God is going to finish the mystery oh Hallelujah so here it is it says the dissociation of the fullness of time might gather together in what and want all things where in Christ okay both in heaven and in Hallelujah somebody said another place visibility both in heaven and in Earth even in him to whom also we have what are you included amen take somebody to hand and say are you included he said we have attained and inheritance isn't that right are you included do you have your inheritance let me see what your inheritance is having attained an inheritance being what predestinated according to what the purpose of him who worketh all things after what the Council of his own will don't you know God has a a perfect will for you and you are in his will to be in his will his perfect will is to be in Christ I got to go on a little further because I want you to see this to be in Christ is to be in the will of the perfect will of God are you with me he says that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ at home in whom ye also trusted that after you what heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom after ye what after you bleed do you bleed and after you believe you were what you didn't receive the Holy Ghost when you bleed but after you bleed you will see it with the Holy Spirit of promise now being sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise means of that means that when God sees you you know you're in the perfect will but God ain't gonna seal you with all that until you get all the growths out of you amen until you stop doing your own thing some people think they see you walk around seal but they still got their own mind and doing what they want to do and what they're big and bad enough to do going where they want to go doing what they want to do and they say uh Brett Simmons you my pastor or brother uh so and so on you you're Pastor so and so on you're about to ask no no you're doing whatever you big and bad enough to do nobody got oversight you told Paul to take him to the flock over to which the Holy Ghost has made you what overseer the feed the Church of God which he's purchased with his what own blood are you with me sometimes we got to understand God order God order for our lives God we're just going to do what we want right whenever we want don't care you don't care we just do it whatever we want when we want how we want but when you come down to them now this is the last verse it said which is the earnest the seal with the Holy Spirit of Promise the 14th verse it's the last one which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession until the praise of his what Glory I'm gonna tell you something God ain't gonna seal see you into your character to you come into that statue that ceiling won't come you might be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and feel the power of God but that ceiling ain't gonna come you might have the spirit of God on your flesh and on your spirit but down in the inside you got to be sealed that means that you really need to do amen God I want your perfect will in my life I want to please you more than anything you know as we were reading the scripture in something the other day you want God more than your necessary food are you with me you want God's Will and plan it's not it's not no uh you know mouth it's action is something that you want to submit yourself to God when you submit yourself to the word of God you submit yourself to God but when you don't submit yourself to the word you're not going to submit yourself to God because God and His word is one they're beginning with the word the word was with God and we're with God when you submit yourself to the word of God you submit yourself to God amen and the Bible says all of you all of us submit ourselves one to another are you with me if there's no submission one to another amen I've never seen in an age before when people tell the preacher how to preach and what to preaching what to say and what not to say even when the preacher make a mistake the people forgive him but I've never seen an age like this people think that they can tell the preaching what to do I never seen such a thing in all these 50 years until this last day age where people's rights they want to control the preacher not even knowing no anointing that's on their lives instead of praying they want to complain did a praying and lifting the ministry up they want to tear down brothers and sisters it's better to lift Folks up than the Tad folks down no matter how many false they got it's better to pray for them and lift them up in prayer are you with me no matter how bad you think they are amen ain't worth you wasting your time criticizing them you need to be on your knees praying I see the condition and I know I need to pray more than ever are you with me because I'ma tell you you make a difference your prayers make a difference for one another your prayers make a difference for the ministry your prayers make a difference your talk make a difference it'd make a big difference too you're criticize and make a difference but you're proud amen your pride in love and in concerning care oh boy what a difference when you love and you concern and you lift them up oh Lord that means more than anything you can ever say are you a man and when you lift them up from your heart it reaches heaven and you say oh oh so-and-so made changes it may changes why because your prayer works not your criticism your prayers your prayer means something that's not my anointed do my profits no harm are you with me have a fear of God in your heart fear God respect that's your brother that's your sister love them lift them up Strong Bad infirmities of wheat encourage them keep them up and prayer lift them up to God to help them because one day it might be you or your child or somebody else child are you with me so lift that one up did you see down don't criticize them don't down them but lift them up in prayer because you don't know when your day coming are you with me because you can reap what you sow so lift them up in prayer don't criticize them lift them up God have mercy we got a lot to pray for
