[20:42] you have your bibles
[20:45] i want to turn to two places the one
[20:47] first let's go to
[20:51] the book of romans the eighth
[21:00] chapter
[21:05] romans 8
[21:10] 12 through 14 and then we turn to the
[21:13] book of revelation
[21:14] 2. romans 8 and 12
[21:19] to 14 therefore brethren
[21:23] we are adapters not to the flesh
[21:26] to live after the flesh for
[21:30] if you leave live after the flesh
[21:33] you shall die but if ye through the
[21:36] spirit
[21:37] do mortify the deeds of the body
[21:40] ye shall live for as many as are led by
[21:45] the spirit of god
[21:47] they are the sons of god
[21:50] let's just pray father we thank you for
[21:53] your word tonight god
[21:55] may you blessed sanctified in jesus name
[21:59] amen you'll be seated and returned to
[22:01] the book of revelation
[22:04] revelation the second chapter
[22:09] i'm just going to read one verse for the
[22:11] sake of time tonight because i'm not
[22:13] mean to be long at all
[22:16] it says talking about the pergamos
[22:20] church age it said
[22:24] so has thou also them
[22:27] that hold the doctrine of the
[22:31] nicolaitan which thing
[22:34] i hate uh tonight
[22:38] i want to talk to you just for a few
[22:40] minutes tonight that i say not meant to
[22:42] be long at all
[22:44] but i want to use for a thought tonight
[22:48] being led by the spirit of god
[22:52] being led by the spirit of god
[22:57] i realizing more
[23:01] and more now
[23:05] that we need the leadership of the holy
[23:09] ghost
[23:13] i've been saying time past
[23:17] that without the leadership of the holy
[23:20] ghost then who's leading
[23:22] us there are only two
[23:26] of spirits and that's the spirit of god
[23:29] and the spirit of the devil
[23:32] and we all are being led by
[23:36] something something
[23:39] is directing us and something is
[23:43] is leading us but where is it leading
[23:46] you
[23:49] uh in time past i i realized that
[23:53] uh sometimes that we
[23:56] [Music]
[23:57] we be trying to lead god instead of god
[24:00] leading us
[24:02] and that's where we get into a lot of
[24:04] trouble at
[24:07] because of we are more smarter and you
[24:10] know
[24:10] can think better for ourselves
[24:13] as we think so uh but
[24:16] the bible says there's a way that
[24:18] seemeth right
[24:22] but that way is the way of death
[24:26] we make choices we make decisions
[24:31] a lot of time without consulting
[24:34] uh seeking god about it
[24:40] and then when we do we get out there
[24:43] and we all alone
[24:47] because we didn't wait
[24:51] or didn't consult god on it
[24:56] no matter what you were doing in this
[24:58] life and i know we all love
[25:00] we like to say we are grown folks and we
[25:03] can handle things with our own but
[25:06] you'll find out you can't
[25:10] i know myself all the things i tried to
[25:12] do it my way or
[25:14] because i feel that is this is right and
[25:17] then when it don't turn all right
[25:19] then i got a mess
[25:22] but why not seek god while he can be
[25:25] found
[25:27] why not the bible said wait on the lord
[25:31] and he shall direct your path
[25:35] see and it's something because
[25:38] we are as human we don't uh feel
[25:42] that we have time to wait
[25:45] we got to have it right now we we we
[25:48] just got to do it
[25:51] but you'll find out that if you wait for
[25:55] a while
[25:57] and wait till you get something
[26:00] from god on it you'll be better off
[26:05] and sometimes i know like opportunities
[26:08] come and
[26:09] you have to make uh you know decisions
[26:12] immediately and
[26:14] i understand now that it it's not
[26:17] good to rush and do anything
[26:22] especially when you're pressured you
[26:25] know
[26:26] to uh i need an answer now
[26:30] it's best to wait even if it means some
[26:34] time to
[26:35] to pass up an opportunity that that
[26:38] seems so great and and so good
[26:44] but it ain't real good of god ain't it
[26:50] it can cause us sometimes some uh uh
[26:53] real heartaches it can sometimes
[26:57] mess our life up you know and
[27:00] and cause us to really lose it
[27:05] because we didn't seek god and get
[27:08] god direction on it
[27:12] you know i just really was uh uh facing
[27:16] something and
[27:17] waiting and waiting you know and you
[27:19] know i'ma tell you something
[27:21] it's good to be patient and wait on god
[27:27] and i understand now you know that god
[27:30] is not in a hurry
[27:33] because god already know
[27:38] what you want to do
[27:42] we are ambitious people
[27:46] we have goals and things that we want to
[27:48] achieve
[27:49] and nothing's wrong with that
[27:52] but why not take it before god
[27:56] because i believe that we really want to
[27:58] do it the right way
[28:00] and i believe without consulting god on
[28:03] it
[28:05] you make a mistake and then after you
[28:09] meet
[28:09] you have to live with that
[28:12] rather it turn out which way you've got
[28:16] to deal with it you know
[28:19] i i said i look at my life sometimes and
[28:23] the things that i
[28:24] uh are dead you know without really
[28:27] praying about it without
[28:29] getting some kind of direction from god
[28:32] and it cost me
[28:36] you know but i realized i can't sit
[28:38] there and mope in it
[28:40] you know i i want to take those things
[28:42] and
[28:43] use them as stuff in the stones
[28:46] you know we ought to learn from the
[28:49] previous
[28:50] things that we've done in time past and
[28:53] and not really are seeking god and
[28:56] getting some spiritual advice from god
[28:59] on it
[29:02] sometimes it really you know it a battle
[29:05] with things in my mind because of
[29:07] choices and you know what i made and i
[29:10] realized
[29:11] now you know the older you get you learn
[29:16] and sometimes the lessons that you learn
[29:19] it costs you
[29:22] but you you have to keep moving
[29:25] and understanding that i need god
[29:28] direction
[29:31] see even now i mean this epidemic we're
[29:34] trying this and
[29:36] we're trying that and we're looking all
[29:39] over the
[29:40] the right way to do it you know and but
[29:43] we we're trying
[29:46] we're coming up with ideas we're coming
[29:49] up with proposal we
[29:51] we're coming up with all type of a
[29:54] relative
[29:54] thing that we are going to try to do and
[29:56] we are finding out
[29:58] all of it is failing
[30:03] and fail to realize that jesus is the
[30:06] only answer
[30:10] he has all the answers to everything
[30:13] that we have made
[30:14] of god has the answer
[30:18] and but because that uh uh people
[30:22] don't want to acknowledge acknowledge
[30:24] that
[30:25] we have a supreme being
[30:29] that knows just what to do
[30:33] but because of intellectual conception
[30:36] in
[30:37] in science and technology that's good in
[30:41] a way but
[30:41] when it comes to god there's no better
[30:44] answer
[30:48] i was looking at uh uh the church
[30:51] changes that we have been dealing that
[30:53] this summer school time passed and
[30:55] it brought me back to when i read uh
[30:58] here
[30:59] in revelation 2 15 uh
[31:02] about the pergamos age
[31:06] talking about how god hated
[31:11] that nicholaity
[31:15] now this was a spirit
[31:19] and if you remember the seven church
[31:21] ages and
[31:22] how now in the nicolaitan age you
[31:25] realize that
[31:26] this was a doctrine in pergamos but
[31:29] in ephesus it started out as a deed
[31:33] as a saying but in partners
[31:37] in the third church it became a literary
[31:41] teaching of the church
[31:44] see it started off subtle with just a
[31:47] little
[31:48] saying about it now but i looked at this
[31:52] and
[31:52] and looked at it and saw the spirit
[31:56] and what it was what it came to do
[32:00] and if you remember now the devil main
[32:03] purpose
[32:04] was to exalt his throne
[32:08] above the most high he wanted to be
[32:12] like the most high god in other words he
[32:16] knew that god
[32:17] was a spirit and they had to worship god
[32:20] in
[32:20] spirit so the devil sent his spirit
[32:26] into the earth and as the god had a
[32:29] gospel
[32:30] the devil had a gospel as god had the
[32:34] holy ghost
[32:35] the devil had a deceiving spirit
[32:39] see he couldn't create nothing
[32:42] but he are a cop it off what
[32:45] god had already made
[32:49] and so his spirit as satan
[32:53] was was so close like god
[32:58] you know that's why the angels that he
[33:00] deceived
[33:01] they believe a third now of
[33:04] heavenly angels believe
[33:08] satan gospel
[33:13] it was that was a spirit that was strong
[33:17] that it caused the angels of god to
[33:20] believe the devil
[33:22] lie and they all got kicked out of
[33:24] heaven
[33:26] and when they got into heaven they came
[33:28] to earth
[33:31] and then because satan got into the
[33:34] human race
[33:36] the way he did you know through the
[33:38] deception of the woman
[33:40] he was able to penetrate
[33:44] and that spirit as eve said the bible
[33:47] say that
[33:48] eve was seduced she was seduced by
[33:52] a spirit that noticed
[33:56] uh when he was talking to eve he didn't
[33:59] tell her
[34:00] what god was saying wasn't true
[34:03] but he just added
[34:07] and eve listened
[34:10] now she had a commandment that don't
[34:13] touch the tree of knowledge and good and
[34:15] evil
[34:16] but because satan made that
[34:20] tree so much like god like
[34:23] truth 99.9
[34:27] true one percent lie
[34:31] and then that spirit that started
[34:34] it existing right now today
[34:39] now i want to read a little something
[34:40] here you know at the server to god was
[34:43] talking about it
[34:44] he said you will recall that i brought
[34:46] out that ephesian
[34:47] age the word nicolaitan comes from two
[34:51] greek words
[34:52] nico means to conquer leo which means a
[34:56] laity
[34:57] naked nicolaity means to conquer
[35:00] the lord conquered the people now why is
[35:04] this such a
[35:05] terrible thing
[35:08] it is terrible because god has never
[35:12] placed his church in the hands of
[35:16] an intellectual headship
[35:20] which moves with political mindedness
[35:25] god always from the old testament
[35:29] he wanted to lead the people of god
[35:32] by his spirit
[35:36] and as long as the people stayed with
[35:39] the moving
[35:40] of the spirit of god they were safe
[35:44] but when they left off and went on their
[35:48] own way and did their own thing
[35:51] chaos and the servant of god
[35:55] said also here he said now uh
[35:58] you remember in the in the efforts of
[36:01] age he said now that
[36:03] uh that the people
[36:08] were being subject somehow in a way
[36:12] that was absolutely contrary to the word
[36:16] of god
[36:19] they some other spirit
[36:22] was had came in and began
[36:25] uh take them away from the real
[36:28] leadership of the holy ghost and then
[36:31] man
[36:32] begin to uh rule over them
[36:37] see not by the holy spirit now
[36:41] but they used uh beca all type of things
[36:44] just to
[36:45] come in and take authority over the
[36:48] people
[36:49] but this was actually a spirit not about
[36:51] the man but
[36:52] it was a spirit that was operating
[36:56] and that spirit is still operating today
[36:59] i was just saying i said it's one of the
[37:02] most
[37:03] urgency things that i believe that the
[37:07] people of god must understand
[37:10] you've got to get the holy ghost
[37:14] without it you are open target
[37:20] so the holy ghost is such an urgent
[37:23] i believe it could never be really or
[37:25] emphasized
[37:26] how greatly that we as ministers
[37:30] must uh uh get the people back
[37:33] to the leadership of the holy ghost
[37:38] and that's why people are just running
[37:40] off and doing
[37:41] this or that because without the holy
[37:43] ghost what else can you do
[37:46] see but the devil has always been trying
[37:50] to get the spirit of god
[37:52] out of the church get it away from the
[37:55] people y'all don't need
[37:57] the holy ghost like that you got a
[38:00] message
[38:02] or you got a deal so you got a dad
[38:06] the very message we have it took us
[38:09] to the very life of god
[38:13] the holy ghost it really
[38:17] stressed that uh what god did was
[38:21] he brought us back to our first
[38:24] origin with the first
[38:27] church in the book of acts as god sent
[38:30] them
[38:30] and told them to go and tarry in
[38:33] jerusalem until you be endued
[38:36] with power see
[38:39] because through uh the gospels you know
[38:43] as yet the holy ghost had not been given
[38:48] but after jesus decision he sent them to
[38:52] the upper room and said
[38:53] wait there because
[38:56] you couldn't really you wouldn't really
[38:59] know what you're doing
[39:00] if i don't sense something
[39:03] if i don't send the comforter
[39:07] jesus said in one place he said it was
[39:09] expedient that i go away
[39:12] because if not then the comfort of the
[39:14] holy ghost won't come
[39:17] and he will lead you teach you and guide
[39:20] you
[39:21] into all truth
[39:24] see the holy ghost will that's one of
[39:27] the
[39:28] evidence the holy ghost will lead you
[39:31] to all truth
[39:34] not just part ways see that's the real
[39:37] holy ghost
[39:38] see you you may have some portion of
[39:42] it but that real hole that goes if you
[39:44] if your
[39:45] your spirit is sincere with god and your
[39:48] heart right the evidence of the holy
[39:51] ghost
[39:51] he'll take you to all truth
[39:57] that's why sometimes to talk to people
[40:00] and you know you holly can convince them
[40:03] that
[40:04] they don't have the holy ghost and i
[40:06] don't try to take that away from it
[40:09] but you know you try to let them know
[40:11] that there's
[40:12] more to what you have
[40:15] there's more to god than just the
[40:18] restoration of the gifts
[40:20] there is more to god you know than just
[40:23] the jumping in the shot
[40:25] that's all right but there is a a person
[40:29] that the spirit of god that wants to
[40:32] get in you he wants to direct you
[40:37] he wants to take you further
[40:41] into the things of god see
[40:44] not just with the gifts that's all right
[40:46] but let's
[40:47] let's get the giver of the gift let's
[40:50] get the person who
[40:52] who gave the gifts and when that
[40:55] life of god the real life of god
[40:59] get in you then he'll show you
[41:02] what you need to do
[41:06] oh but you know sometimes you know how
[41:08] we are when it
[41:10] comes to religion
[41:13] which is one of the the most uh
[41:15] dangerous
[41:16] aspect of anything you know because of
[41:19] our country
[41:20] and everybody seems to know god
[41:24] you know no you can hardly meet anybody
[41:27] that don't
[41:28] know god but when you try to carry them
[41:31] back to the word and
[41:33] and try to show them what the scripture
[41:35] the scriptures don't
[41:37] contradict you know one another
[41:41] you know god don't do it man does that
[41:46] well now in in this uh nicolaitan
[41:49] this spirit here what it was actually
[41:52] doing
[41:52] it began to move the people you remember
[41:56] in the
[41:56] ephesus they already left their first
[41:59] love
[42:01] which was the word and when you leave
[42:05] off the word then there's something else
[42:09] taking control over you
[42:12] see the holy ghost the spirit of god
[42:15] won't
[42:16] take you away from the word
[42:20] because they are one but it wants to
[42:23] take you further into the word see
[42:27] because the word is eternal and it
[42:30] keeps getting brighter god began to
[42:33] reveal himself
[42:35] you know to you more and more
[42:40] that's why i appreciate you know the
[42:42] message that god
[42:43] sent for us in this hour you know
[42:46] because it really
[42:47] opens up our spiritual understanding
[42:51] about the things of god and what god
[42:54] wants to do in our lives
[42:57] god wants a church that's led by
[43:00] his spirit you know a lot of times
[43:04] we always said we can have the spirit of
[43:07] god on us
[43:08] on our flesh and on our spirit
[43:11] that's okay but god wants you to get it
[43:13] down in your
[43:14] soul and so many times
[43:18] we settle for it just being on us
[43:22] but god wants to be down in you
[43:27] where he is leading you
[43:31] he is speaking to you as an
[43:34] individual and telling you what you need
[43:37] to do
[43:39] even through the preaching of the word
[43:41] you know as i
[43:42] i'm just recalling instead of feasting
[43:45] you know as brother ernest spoke the
[43:47] other night you know
[43:49] to be able to know when the spirit of
[43:52] god
[43:53] is speaking especially to you
[43:57] it'll do something to your inside
[44:00] you know it's not just a good sermon but
[44:04] i was thinking earlier about hebrews 4
[44:06] 12 says
[44:07] the word of god is quick it's
[44:10] powerful it's sharp
[44:14] it's a discerner see and that's what the
[44:18] the word they want to go down and
[44:20] discern
[44:21] us it discern what your needs
[44:24] are and god begin to meet the needs
[44:29] through the preaching of the word but
[44:31] you know the spirit of god does that you
[44:36] know as i just was absorbing the net
[44:38] you know i just been telling brother
[44:39] earnest you know how the lord
[44:41] blessed and and different women were
[44:43] calling and said oh my how they really
[44:45] needed
[44:46] you know what was said you know i say
[44:48] you know we
[44:49] need you know god you know to speak
[44:52] to the people needs but you got to have
[44:56] an
[44:56] ear to hear what the spirit is saying
[44:59] you got to know when is the holy ghost
[45:01] or not
[45:03] you got to know that uh what you need is
[45:06] not just
[45:06] man preaching good words but you need
[45:09] the spirit of god
[45:11] to quicken that word that the word come
[45:14] alive
[45:16] and when they come alive it'll do
[45:19] something in you
[45:21] it'll change you it'll cause you
[45:24] you need to repent to repent whatever it
[45:28] need
[45:28] that's what the word come to do see when
[45:31] it's
[45:32] preached under the right inspiration
[45:35] of the holy ghost
[45:38] oh yes i realize you know that
[45:43] more and more how urgent
[45:48] it is for us as people of god
[45:52] to understand the leadership of the holy
[45:56] ghost and
[45:57] from the leadership of a man
[46:00] now i want to read something and i'm
[46:02] going to
[46:03] come to a little halt here in it but
[46:06] i want to get this out
[46:10] because that spirit that the servant of
[46:12] god says now
[46:14] whatever that spirit was doing back then
[46:16] he said
[46:17] it's doing it now
[46:20] it was taking the people from the
[46:23] leadership
[46:24] of the holy ghost to a man man-made
[46:27] ideas and
[46:29] uh all and blending in with all kind of
[46:32] political stuff and
[46:34] mixing it all up and then just throwing
[46:36] it into the church
[46:39] see the devil know what he's doing
[46:42] you know about you know he's crafty he's
[46:45] smart he's very
[46:46] intelligent he knows how to
[46:49] uh make things look like his
[46:53] god and then the people are not
[46:56] spiritually minded to discern
[46:58] what really is going they think that oh
[47:01] that's god
[47:03] and don't understand that when you start
[47:06] twisting the word and
[47:07] mixing the word then you didn't kill the
[47:11] effect of it
[47:14] and see eve thought really what she had
[47:16] was right
[47:19] she thought what she had gotten she
[47:21] refund adam and all
[47:22] adam look what i got
[47:26] she thought she had a new revelation
[47:30] didn't even know she was deceived
[47:34] by a cunning spirit that had moved
[47:38] in on her and she had no idea
[47:42] oh my i wonder sometimes
[47:45] do we really understand
[47:49] who is leading us
[47:54] this
[47:59] see how it started out in the early
[48:01] church it was called
[48:03] deeds in the pergamos
[48:06] it became a doctrine it became the
[48:09] standard
[48:10] it became the unbending way
[48:14] it finally took over and god
[48:17] was pushed aside
[48:20] oh my push god all the way out
[48:24] oh it started so small so quietly
[48:27] so inefficiently it looks so good
[48:31] it seemed so sound that it
[48:34] caught a hold and like a parthon and
[48:37] squeeze out
[48:38] every breath and kill all the spirit
[48:42] spirituality there was
[48:45] in the church that's what the devil want
[48:47] to do now
[48:50] he want to kill all the spirituality
[48:54] in the church and give the people uh
[48:58] emotion excitement you know a good
[49:02] singing nothing wrong with those things
[49:04] but we
[49:05] need the holy ghost
[49:09] we need god's spirit and to know that
[49:12] you know it's god that's in control
[49:16] not this man preaching thing that's good
[49:19] but
[49:19] a man that has been uh in the presence
[49:23] of god that has gotten
[49:25] a word from god
[49:28] because if not did it just good sermons
[49:32] and people get excited we we feel good
[49:37] but then no yoke's been broken
[49:40] no deliverance into people's lives
[49:44] you leave out you know uh just like you
[49:46] came in
[49:47] you feel a little better but after
[49:50] tomorrow it's gone
[49:53] but we need more than that we need
[49:56] something that we can take home that we
[49:59] can get somewhere in our clothing and
[50:00] say
[50:01] lord help me i heard
[50:04] a word from you tonight lord
[50:07] and i need deliverance i need
[50:10] yolks broken i need my family seed
[50:15] i need the holy ghost because we tired
[50:18] just coming to a church gathering
[50:22] i'm telling you the truth
[50:25] to church has become so uh
[50:29] ritual you know
[50:32] tuesday or wednesday or friday or sunday
[50:36] and but where's the changes
[50:40] because god wants to change us the word
[50:43] is supposed to have
[50:44] a liberty to
[50:47] search us out to break us up
[50:52] sometimes it cuts it rebukes
[50:57] but yet it also heals
[51:01] yeah it cuts some time to hear it but
[51:04] it'll do you good
[51:06] you got to understand when that come god
[51:10] he's working on you he's telling you
[51:14] i love you that's why i'm correcting you
[51:17] that's why i'm showing you this is what
[51:20] you need
[51:22] it's not the money it's not the
[51:24] education but
[51:25] you need me you need the spirit of god
[51:30] to show you what i want done
[51:34] and that's what we need until then
[51:39] until we really get to the place to you
[51:42] know to really
[51:43] understand you know it takes something
[51:46] to get something you know
[51:50] it takes something to get something
[51:54] but i say this you know i'm finding out
[51:57] that
[51:58] whatever is being preached to the people
[52:00] that's what they're going to grab hold
[52:02] of
[52:04] if it's just good quotes or if it's just
[52:06] good information
[52:07] they'll get that but then they'll find
[52:10] out that that won't keep them
[52:13] they need something that's going to keep
[52:15] them
[52:17] and no pastor can keep them no
[52:20] church can keep them but the holy ghost
[52:23] is a
[52:23] keeper that's why more
[52:27] and brother was saying that we have got
[52:30] to get
[52:30] uh uh something from god to be able to
[52:34] get the people
[52:35] back into the mode of the holy ghost
[52:39] because without it their backslide
[52:44] nothing else we preach know that we got
[52:48] to preach every all these things
[52:49] but i mean nothing is more urgency
[52:53] to a church of believers is
[52:56] getting them to the holy ghost
[53:00] it's urgent to me it's one of the
[53:04] the greatest message that ever been
[53:06] brought
[53:07] forth i be brother branham said that of
[53:10] jesus first doctrine he preached
[53:12] to the church was you must be born again
[53:17] i believe that ought to be our first
[53:19] message
[53:21] until we get the people to uh that
[53:24] literary life of god and they crying out
[53:27] for it night and day
[53:31] everything else we are preaching almost
[53:33] be secondary
[53:35] they have a lot of information of things
[53:37] that they've read and
[53:39] things that they have heard but we need
[53:41] more
[53:43] every time you i talk the people that
[53:45] were saying they want more god
[53:48] they want more god but my thought is but
[53:50] then you need the holy ghost
[53:53] because if you get that the holy ghost
[53:56] you'll find out that he's all you need
[54:00] in him is everything
[54:04] it's your joy it's your peace
[54:07] it's your revival it's your teacher
[54:11] he's your god he's your protector he's
[54:14] your provider
[54:15] he's everything he even be a mama when
[54:19] your mom lives
[54:20] a father when you're fatherless
[54:24] what he wants to be god bless you
[54:36] tonight
[54:46] god is good amen we appreciate the word
[54:50] today
[54:52] praise god i thought about it the song
[54:54] said he never failed me yet
[54:56] and everywhere i go i want the world to
[54:58] know jesus christ never failed me yet
[55:02] appreciate the word amen god's servant
[55:05] says
[55:06] the purpose is to pick up your pen and
[55:09] write
[55:11] and when he wrote he dwelled about a a
[55:14] people
[55:16] that would come on the scene that would
[55:17] be a super race a super
[55:22] people that have come into the very
[55:26] image
[55:27] of god the very image of god
[55:32] i said that's what it was all about the
[55:35] purpose was
[55:36] of eve was to reproduce adam
[55:39] who was adam and god made
[55:42] man in his own image
[55:47] what are we in this last days what a god
[55:50] what is the purpose of the bride
[55:54] is to reproduce him the last adam which
[55:58] is christ
[56:00] we are to come in his very image
[56:05] we are to be just like him
[56:08] are you with me so we're the word bride
[56:12] he was
[56:13] the manifestation of god
[56:18] god was manifested in the flesh
[56:23] he was the very word of god
[56:27] being made manifest amen
[56:31] so john said that which we have
[56:34] looked upon that which we have heard
[56:37] that's what
[56:38] with our hands we've handled is the word
[56:40] of life
[56:42] the very word of god had become flesh
[56:47] dwelt among us we beheld the glory of
[56:51] the glory and the only begotten
[56:53] of the father we saw god
[56:58] we saw god and we handled it
[57:01] amen we saw him with our eyes with our
[57:05] five senses
[57:07] we saw the word we saw the very image we
[57:10] saw the very expression
[57:12] we saw the very mind of god expressed
[57:16] and became flesh god came now
[57:21] amen we saw god again
[57:24] what the world looking for a
[57:27] superman but what is god calling its
[57:31] people
[57:31] to his very image the purpose of eve
[57:36] was to reproduce adam the purpose of the
[57:38] bride
[57:39] is to reproduce christ
[57:43] amen sons and daughters of god in the
[57:46] very
[57:46] image of god amen
[57:49] that's what we are to reproduce him that
[57:54] very
[57:54] image we see jesus again
[57:59] we see christ in bradford
[58:03] oh yes amen we must
[58:07] come in that very image
[58:10] because we are to be one by his wife

[58:22] him that he and
[58:25] she are one
[58:28] father make them one that's what it's
[58:32] all about brother
[58:33] that's what is all about sister maybe
[58:37] the very
[58:37] image is very light in the oneness with
[58:40] god
[58:42] oh yes we're in the last days
[58:46] god calling a people there must be a
[58:50] deep
[58:51] cry not calling to the deed
[58:54] calling us to come in that very image
[58:58] oh yes we can't be satisfied we're just
[59:03] going to churches uh but the jeremiah is
