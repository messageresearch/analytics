third verse blessed be god and the father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy has begun us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead for who are kept by the power of god through faith until salvation ready to be revealed in the last time six that the trial of your faith being much more precious than go of gold that's perish though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearance of jesus christ 8. receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your soul 10. searching what uh what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them signifies when it testified beforehand of the suffering of christ and the glory that should follow 12. wherefore girdle up the lungs of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ 14. but as he which has called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation together because it is written be holy for i am holy god bless you toward you praise god we thank god again for the volume i need it turned down a little we thank god again for this day that he's made you know brother and sister i was out here now just reading this chapter this morning as i was i had another way i was gonna go and and as i was down in prayer i got caught up in the spirit and i started speaking in tongues and enjoying the lord and uh i was so excited about what god was saying to my spirit and i i it was beyond you know beyond just being normal and i was already you know had several ways to come and talk about i thought i was going to talk about out of order are out of position a positionally placed as the prophet said and talk about adoption and so forth and i realized that so oftentimes our problems are because of people are out of position you know there are many that want certain positions that is not for them amen absalom wanted to be king so he he devised a scheme whereby he can get what he wants you see what i'm saying sometimes amen we want what god don't want us to have amen amen and sometimes we'll set out on god you know it was the spirit of god telling me like a little child and they can't get without fall out and roll on the floor and scream and you know the mama said okay okay [Music] what you want baby so the baby cries and you give him some milk check the diaper ain't nothing wrong [Music] just keep on hollering so the parents try to find out what's wrong what's what the child is doing trying to boss the parent around that the parent can't get a revelation of that when the child is in the crib of a little baby that that child trying to boss them but a lot of times people in the spirit room they try to boss god around if they can't have it i go to a church where i can find it okay i'm looking right here [Music] just whenever they get upset i'm gone it's the lack of in the spirit realm you have a lot of crybabies it used to be where we played basketball or whatever you know a football a street ball and sometimes you had to choose your team especially in basketball and if the ball belonged to a certain fellow nobody wanted to choose him to play he'd take his ball and go home so we ain't got nothing to play with you see what i'm saying and some folks will take their ball and go home because nobody chose them to be on their team and see what happens is nobody can play if i can't play are you with me we have a lot of people do some some stuff in the spirit realm in the spirit realm that they don't even know that they're out of position if i can't have what i want then god i ain't gonna do nothing i ain't gonna do nothing you don't give me what i want i won't i wouldn't clap my hand you think i'm gonna say amen you'll never get me to say amen because i don't have what i want what do you want i don't know what you want god to do for you i don't know but i want what i want so you do everything you can do to try to please the baby give them milk change adopt them you know some parents that have had uh children that have gone through certain changes that you know all of every child is not the same and you got to know when the child is faking are you with me and you know where the child really has a need and a lot of times you know the children practice what they see the parents do a lot of times things ain't right with the headship in the house if mama can't get what she wants then the house is in a turmoil and the children say okay if this work for mama it'll work for me i'm gonna make it chaotic in here if i can't get what i want see we live in a very selfish world where people are so self-centered and sometimes folks are so calm-minded till they're out of position i i don't know how this is going to come together concerning fool's gold are you with me but it's because of lack of position out of place when people are out of position or out of place see you cannot place yourself in position the holy ghost has to position and place you where he wants you to be praise god it's not you might think that this is my position this is where i ought to be but if the holy ghost don't do it then praise god if god don't do it then you don't worry about it [Music] are you with me somebody taking my nobody can ever be you and nobody can ever even stop you from what god has for you they can try i'm talking about real gold and fool's goal are you with me it's a difference between real gold and fuel gold see gold has to be got to go through they got to go through the fire and so if you got it right if you really uh real gold then you're gonna have to go through the fire [Music] now amen you can determine whether or not it's full goal a real goal amen by how it reacts to the fire are you with me amen because some folk came in react amen to their reaction to the fire it does not purify them but are you with me so often times our reaction amen [Music] now let me try to put this together because a lot of times our problems amen because we're out of place and out of position amen if the home is out of position amen then the children if the head ship in the home amen is out of position then the children somewhat get despondent displaced and confused and and they go to school and they have a complexes and they don't know how amen to you know how to position themselves in life because they meant because there is not a level of understanding they have not seen and because in so many homes there is not a father and a mother that's sometimes there's single parents and they're trying to do the best that they can so a lot of times young men can see headship so they don't really know how to be a man are you with me and then when handshape come amen praise god you know i i i want to tell you there's so many sisters amen i've seen sisters that more spiritual than me they could preach a better sermon than i can they they they they're more gifted than i can i am and i've seen god really deal with them amen but you may amen have all the quality spiritual revelation knowledge amen and think came in amen i'm better than my husband amen but a wise and a godly woman will submit herself even though even though she knows amen that she's on another level but she's a godly woman and she understands her hat is a husband are you up man so she submits herself willingly not because he amen says i am the head and i am who i am see amen that's the way amen the church is subject to christ willingly and humbly not because he's going to beat us over the head because we love him amen i said it's a lack of love we must know the position and the place that god has uh amen ordained for you and i for concerning our homeland and where we're positioning the place in the hour of the end time and what god is requiring amen for you and i is not what it was when paul says as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation faith amen virtue now it's temporary but we're in hatchet time [Music] what god amen is looking for you to be amen walk in perfect love are you with me so god is requiring amen but your faith amen has to be tried and tested because god is positionally placing you in the place that you need to be in this hour not only is it a positionally placing the church the bride in her position in her homeland but you as individuals amen not you so much is fine in your place but yet you must find your place let him lead you amen let him guide you hallelujah because the holy ghost knows what amen what he wants to do with the word praise god and you being part of him who is the wife then god knows amen how and where he wants to positionally place you in the body are you with me because we don't know ourselves we just yield to god's will god let your perfect will be done in my life because i can't lead myself but why you lead me i'll follow i need him to lead me i need him to guide me oh great jehovah hallelujah you need him brother sister now i i i i said don't don't be a fool y'all ever heard somebody say that how many you ever heard somebody said don't be a fool amen the bible said call no man be a fool but a fool said it's hard there no god in the right he said paul says oh you foolish galatians he said call no man fool who has been with you are you with me so he i so don't mind me when i said don't be a fool amen amen praise god don't be a fool let me describe what the words say amen and i said don't let the devil [Music] blind you amen amen don't let the devil blind you or fool you because the devil amen he'll blind you and he'll fool you he'll make you think you've got something that's real amen and it can't go through the test you'll find that when it's tried the fire come it burns up what happens when god is taking you through your trial you messing with me you watch that flesh rise up watch that flesh watch with the things that folks say and the action that folks act like they oh no is that christ is that christ like is that jesus is that the way a christian ought to respond uh uh uh uh tell me is this real goal or is this fool go he's saying the trine of your faith is more what more precious than what gold are you with me so here we said don't be don't let the devil blind you hear revelation all three amen because i believe the devil has blinded so many people till they think they got real gold and they got fools going you know it looked like gold amen but a real somebody that's you know if you want to test it just put the fire to it see because some folks are trying to convince you that they got real gold praise god i got faith i believe every word i believe the prophet i believe the bible i believe everything who are you trying to convince the five gonna tell it are you with me the fire approve it are you with me man oh i'm leaving the master i believe the bible no the father will tell the story was it not its full goal or was it not just the lord oh yeah the fire tell us it's not how loud you scream and not how much you trump and it's not amen because you go to broad tabernacle or because you say i believe the message or or we go to this one or that one amen is whether or not amen praise god let's put the word amen to it amen amen let's put the word to it praise god amen because the word amen our god is a consuming fire amen praise god let's put the word jeremiah said it was in me like fire [Music] amen amen shut up in my bones lord have mercy amen sometimes amen amen we have to go through manifold temptation glory to jesus sometimes we have to go through some stuff we can't get around it praise god we have to amen we have to be talked about building stone light old treat it wrong thank you jesus i was telling one of the little brothers amen i said folk do all kind of stuff and say you know folk know you better than you know yourself they know you better than god know you gonna have a conversation and oh that brother that sister that song so oh about it is that old man they can talk hours about you they know more than you ever knew about yourself amen and then you sometimes you know it's the bible said the lord what knows them that are you up man see amen sometimes amen praise god you got to forget about all the outside noise and all the nonsense talking won't get you nowhere because sometimes if that person got a problem the bible said it's strong or what are you with me the thing is that are you praying amen for your brother or for your sister are you complaining about them see i i was telling caleb the other day i said caleb i mean you can't i think we were riding in the car and i said you see that car that white car that black car and the different colored cars i said a blind man it don't matter how much i tell him that's a white card he blind can't see it there's no use of me trying to beat that in his head that hey you see that that that's that's a purity mountain he can't imagine in his mind and he still can't see her you don't know whether the mountain got green grass or got tall trees all they could imagine or that but you don't know you can't see it why because you're blind are you with me and sometimes we get mad at somebody that's blind when the folks are blind and you getting upset amen you ought to stop you ought to start drinking you ought to talk you know to stop living a blind man amen why are you getting upset with them pray for them because if their eyes would ever come open they'll know amen i'm getting ready to kill myself are you a man see what happens amen the thing folk do amen they do it sometimes because amen they're ignorant amen amen sometimes folk ain't doing stuff willingly the devil had deceived them and you upset at a deceived person you need you should pity them you should feel sorry for them they still get all oh i'm gonna tell you something i don't know what's going on again oh no no no no somebody said brother sims on someone said i said thank you see because when you grow up you start saying thank you thank you very much god bless you thank you i appreciate that but when you was a baby why did you say that when you grow up say thank you because you're going to pass through some things some fire and you're coming into maturity you're coming into the place where you're amen you're coming into that place where god amen is amen amen you're coming up a little higher some things they that used to bother you they don't bother you no more why because the fire took care of that [Music] come on the fire had to take all the gross out of you raise all the impurity out amen that's what some things had to let me come out amen you had to let some stuff come out of you that you didn't know was in you it wasn't because you wouldn't go amen but god was purifying you are you up there hallelujah yes god had to get some of that meanness at you come on somebody they mean sometimes we were live we talked a little mean and we uh our conversation wasn't always holy like it ought to be it didn't have a love in our speech our words were not seasoned with salt are you with me but god had to even let us go through some fire oh god to feel good when the fire burn oh you said good this fire was good to us amen praise god is it fire just made you amen go a little higher in the law the fire just brought some stuff out praise god the next time you pass that way you say thank you why am i because i've been already through glory to jesus i've been that way before hallelujah i know amen what we on me there it don't harm me no more it don't hurt me no more i don't feel discouraged no more hallelujah because i don't bent through the fire now hallelujah praise god sometimes your butt can scone but when you don't bend through it ain't that praise god and makes it easy the next time amen praise god he said my yoke is easy my burden is life hallelujah i learned how to lead and depend on jesus see i i i'm learning amen in the process of getting where god wants me to be in the position that god want to place me that i got to take some stuff i gotta go through some things maybe because god is walking on me hallelujah thank god because he thought counted me worthy paul said economy worthy to suffer amen i thank god economy worthy to suffer amen if i didn't suffer i knew i can't reign but he carried me wide to go through some suffering hallelujah praise god no suffering of the present time seemed to be glorious amen you don't seem it don't seem to be something that we enjoy and they remember after us oh we can shine now i can thank you now i can say lord thank you thank you for victory thank you for delivering me thank you for asking me hallelujah because i've been through some fire oh hallelujah somebody came praising this morning amen because you don't know how to deal with the fire you don't know how to deal with what's that's tough he meant you're going through amen but when you know how to deal with it you said i'm a praise god anyhow lord i bless your holy name lord i love you more there are others that'll take their ball and go home god amen if i can't have in my way it's the highway are you with me you give me what i want amen if you don't give me what i want some folks amen they leave god if god don't give them what they think they deserve or they won't then i ain't serving god because god ain't giving me what i want they may i wanted me a husband here give me one i'm gonna get me one praise god i wanted a wife he didn't give me one so i'll find one come on somebody can we can we trust god for our needs amen god knows what we need better than we know ourselves sometimes we amen when god is texting us and trying to see what you're waiting on me will you wait on me will you trust me in spite of what i'm going through lord lord i love you oh jesus jesus oh what oh lord i gotta get here to revelation 3 and 17 but you know y'all y'all see why i was so excited this morning speaking in tongues and just enjoying the lord but the lord said some things to me and i believe it was god but i gotta wait amen wait and see amen amen praise god amen amen i sometimes you go into that place amen and you don't want to come out of that place praise god you go into a place with god and you want to stay in that secret place amen praise god hallelujah praise god because sometimes when you come out people look at you and they look at you strange because amen praise god you're going into that secret place and into that glory praise god and you're so happy about what god is doing in your life amen what god is doing in the inner man praise god you know that god is walking on you praise god god saying things to your spirit speaking in the inside amen praise god saying the marvelous and glorious things praise god i i i start to write it down but i said no i ain't gonna write praise god i just said lord thank you for saying the things you say amen after speaking in tongues a while i began to i want to listen to what you're saying lord and then i just started listening and then i began see brother and sister god oh god god is a good god praise god amen see you ought to try spending time in prayer and spending time with god can fill you with his spirit fill you up amen and let your cup overflow amen and then god began to deal with you amen you'll find out it's another another whole dimension as as i said about the blind man look 17. he says because thou says this is not what he says he said i'm telling you what you say amen are you with me three and 17. because thou said what see what i'm saying i'm talking about food gold see the food go is you say the most trouble you have with folk is they tell you what they think about so and then they're tending to somebody else's business some folks are out of position they think they see more than the pastors see some of them i can but a person does they know how to submit are you with me they know how to submit and be a helper not an instigator and a divider [Music] and a problem amen are you with me if they are more spiritual and god is dealing with them they know how to be in subjects subjection amen other than that you can find a house divided it cannot work it cannot stand are you with me but when it's for the welfare amen of the body of christ then god uses those things that he revealed to be a blessing god will not show you something see the prophet said is it coveted by the blood then god won't show it to him are you up man but god is showing if it's not confessed and covered by the blood oh you look man so those things that are not covered by the blood praise god then god can come up and he'll give a word because it's not covered by the blood if it's covered by the blood then god won't let the prophet see amen amen now if it's covered by the blood god won't let the fire full ministry preach on it amen but if it's not covered by the blood then they can preach it amen why because god won't expose it amen amen and then it takes repentance and confession to get it right oh you look man but if it's not covered by oh you want me it's some things god take the cover off amen but only those that have eyes to see can see but if the devil has blinded them and i don't mean with the physical eye but i'm talking about the spiritual eye of your understanding amen amen it takes the holy ghost to reveal spiritual things see without the holy ghost amen people amen they'll go for the fool's goal instead of the real thing the real thing that god is leading us into perfect love are you with me god wants you to walk in love walk in faith to walk in love are you up man god don't want you to walk oh god amen let me see because thou says you know a lot of times it's not what we say is what he says but he says here because god says i am what i'm rich and i'm what i'm increased with goods and i have what you see how needy we are lord we need you every hour we need you every day lord i have things in my life that you're working on and lord i don't have time to look at other folks because lord you're working on me lord i need more god just help me lord i need help see what i'm saying all of us ought to look at god we need more of you i don't have time to look down on my brother my sister amen i need to look to god for oh because i need something amen but there are those that said i have need of what nothing now we look at it as a church age but we want to look at it as individuals amen with the attitude that i don't need nothing that's why i can look down on others there's a spirit that comes with the message of the hour that they look down on everybody else that they don't have needed nothing and that's a sad sad way to be are you with me but we need him every day and every hour amen amen are you with me we feel the spirit of superior authority the jews felt like they were superior to the gentiles the pharisees felt like they were superior as i was reading the church ages they feel like they were superior to the science season the sadducees like vice versa and so forth the prophet god talked about in the perfect programs age about the first church of rome and he was telling you how they got in the condition that they were in and sometimes we if we take it through history and bring it back to present day we'll find that the same spirits to work then work right in our presence are you with me the spirit of amen the antichrist got in then and the spirit of the antichrist is still here are you with me it's against the word anti-christ against the word are you with me you know you try to help not to hinder you try to be a blessing not a curse amen are you up man amen did somebody do you wrong you say lord forgive them amen amen amen i'm waiting to see what god gonna do about it amen don't go and leo looked tree and wait on god to destroy an animal when they repented are you with me and get mad because god didn't do it okay jonah you know what i'm saying so by the grace of god let's let's just uh uh uh brother oh god i gotta close i can't get no i got too much to talk about ain't god good man i'm talking about people don't let the devil blind you let me try to read this he says have needed nothing and no it's not the doll of wretched miserable poor and what that's what a blind and naked blind the devil are blind you and i i i
