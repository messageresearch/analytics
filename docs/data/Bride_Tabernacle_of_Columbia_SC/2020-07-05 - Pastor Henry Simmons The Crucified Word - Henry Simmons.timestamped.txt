[27:05] Christ has been identified throughout
[27:07] all ages but we want to talk about the
[27:12] crucified word the word has always been
[27:19] despised and rejected of men I heard
[27:27] Peter said two stones that were set at
[27:31] nought of you builders same has become
[27:36] the head of the corner he's been a
[27:41] rejected King and a rejected stone but
[27:48] as we talk to you today about the
[27:51] crucified word somebody's saying the
[27:56] song can't you see how they're done
[27:59] my lord I trust that you'll be able to
[28:04] identify and to recognize how they have
[28:10] done wallow the crucified word Christ
[28:18] identified throughout all ages acts 2
[28:24] and 22 you men of Israel hear these
[28:30] words Jesus imagine a man approved of
[28:35] God man approved of God among you all
[28:43] among you by miracles wonders and signs
[28:46] which God did by him in the midst of you
[28:50] that ye yourselves also know him being
[28:55] delivered by the determined counts and
[28:58] foreknowledge of God you taken and by
[29:01] wicked hands have crucified and slain
[29:06] that god bless the reader which word you
[29:08] may be seated you've crucified and slain
[29:15] surely can't you see how see what they
[29:22] have done to my lord they crucified and
[29:28] the set of slain says in 24 verse whom
[29:36] God raised up having loosed the pains of
[29:40] death because it was not possible that
[29:44] he should be Holden of it they for David
[29:49] speak concerning him I foresaw the Lord
[29:54] always before my face for he is on my
[29:59] right hand that I should not be moved
[30:02] there forth in my heart rejoice and my
[30:05] tongue was glad moreover also my flesh
[30:09] shall rest in hope because thou will not
[30:14] leave my soul in hell he went to hell
[30:19] for you and I but he wasn't
[30:23] left inhale I would not leave my soul in
[30:29] Hell neither with our supper the Holy
[30:33] One to see corruption he died but he did
[30:37] not see corruption his body did not see
[30:43] corruption
[30:44] it did not modify because he was the
[30:48] word said thou has made known to me the
[30:56] way of life thou shalt make me full of
[31:00] joy will tock countenance men and
[31:04] brethren let me freely speak to you of
[31:08] the patriarch David that he's both dead
[31:12] and as supper Co is with us unto this
[31:16] day therefore being the prophet
[31:19] and knowing that God has sworn withhold
[31:23] to him that of the food of his lawns
[31:27] according to the flesh he would raise up
[31:29] Christ to set on his Rome seeing this
[31:33] before speak of the resurrection of
[31:38] Christ that his soul was not left in
[31:42] hell we didn't leave him there
[31:44] neither his flesh did see corruption
[31:49] this Jesus has God raised up world we
[31:55] are witnesses therefore being by the
[32:00] right hand of God exalted and having
[32:04] received of the father the promise of
[32:08] the Holy Ghost he has shared for this
[32:13] which he now see in here for they saw on
[32:18] the day of Pentecost the outpouring of
[32:22] the Holy Ghost
[32:24] they were to tarry in Jerusalem after
[32:28] Jesus had rose from the dead and gave
[32:30] them they meant a commission I want you
[32:33] to tarry in the city of Jerusalem I want
[32:36] you to wait there tell you be endued
[32:39] with power from on high
[32:42] brother and sister amen you need to wait
[32:47] they meant till you get the power amen
[32:51] he said after the Holy Ghost is come
[32:53] upon you you shall have power and you
[32:57] should be witnesses of me when the power
[33:00] will come maybe you can't witness till
[33:04] you get the power but when the power
[33:07] will come you can catch somebody
[33:11] hallelujah that the comforter has come
[33:15] you can catch somebody ibid Reedy by the
[33:20] blood of the Lamb oh yes it's time that
[33:26] we take a stand for the word the
[33:31] crucified word
[33:35] now he says for David has not ascended
[33:41] into heaven the 34th Ward sense but he
[33:46] say it's himself the Lord said unto my
[33:49] lord sit down on my right hand until i
[33:52] make tower fools die footstool
[33:54] therefore he meant therefore let all the
[33:58] house of israel north surely all
[34:03] columbian north surely everybody here
[34:08] and everybody listen north surely I want
[34:12] you to a man I want you to be able to
[34:15] hear and recognize what Jesus and who
[34:19] Jesus is and what he's done for you and
[34:22] I that all the house of hildren or
[34:26] surely let all the house of Columbia nor
[34:29] surely the God in me that same Jesus
[34:40] whom you have crucified both Lord and
[34:44] Christ the same loan that he killed the
[34:48] same one that died God raised him up I'm
[34:55] saying
[34:56] you cannot kill the word they can try
[35:08] but God has the power to called away to
[35:14] live again for truly Jesus Christ they
[35:21] meant what the Word made flesh and now
[35:27] him being the word I heard him when he
[35:32] was gone from judgement Hall to judgment
[35:35] home
[35:43] what is truth the truth is the truth
[36:25] [Music]
[36:35] so brother and sister the devil did not
[36:40] attack even Adam but he attacted the
[36:45] world he said god I want a question I
[36:56] want you to reason with me fold in a
[36:59] while but rather sister you cannot
[37:02] compromise and reason with the word when
[37:07] God said something it's perfect
[37:10] they made it converts to Sarah you
[37:15] cannot try what the word God we believe
[37:22] it and we receive it and accept it but
[37:27] what happens the devil tries to put a
[37:32] little doubt in your mind
[37:35] David ye has God see that I have a tree
[37:41] Oh God
[37:42] you can eat but of the tree of knowledge
[37:46] of good and evil but God does know that
[37:50] if you eat of that
[37:54] you'll become like god oh yes he tries
[38:00] to make you eat the tree of doubt and
[38:05] unbelief and he can you to
[38:10] intellectually reason with the word has
[38:13] to be accepted the word just like it is
[38:24] fake
[38:26] leads would not take the place of the
[38:30] way God has fortified and covered men
[38:36] when they were fortified by the Word of
[38:42] God and he had clothed them with his
[38:47] word the word was good enough to keep
[38:53] dama called in in righteousness
[38:56] are you with me but what the devil did
[39:01] he caused him to doubt what God said and
[39:07] that's the day and that's the day amen
[39:18] what God came in the cool of the evening
[39:21] she found what he took their agent
[39:30] covered themselves he said I hid myself
[39:33] because I was naked Wow they were naked
[39:39] because they will adopt the covering of
[39:42] the world brothers sisters let the word
[39:46] cover you they put on the whole armour
[39:51] God hey if you abide in me and my words
[39:57] abide in you then you can have what you
[40:02] will
[40:04] I will do it I'm saying God waited
[40:09] better close unite with his word the
[40:13] crucified the world then afire through
[40:17] all ages they meant the word they met
[40:23] before it was a word it was a thought
[40:27] and the thoughts we speak of at the
[40:31] genes of God what was in God's mind he
[40:36] wanted to express amen and God a man
[40:41] began to speak a many Stokes Amen when
[40:46] God spoke his talks they meant they
[40:50] became the way and I faith we understand
[40:53] that the worlds were framed by the Word
[40:56] of God I want you to know Amen we got a
[41:00] powerful thing they meant when they got
[41:04] dog food we got a powerful weapon know
[41:10] that they met the Word of God
[41:13] it'll keep you they met in a hill he
[41:18] said it wide and it healed them the
[41:21] ignorance of the word give it night
[41:24] David the word have I hid in my heart
[41:27] that I might not sin against God the
[41:32] word is a capable the word is a healer
[41:37] the word is a deliverer
[41:40] the word is you see the way will
[41:44] transform you the word would change the
[41:48] word would deliver you the way would
[41:52] such a free Wow yes the word the
[41:56] Crucified word the devil has always
[42:03] talked to were three the Lord the devil
[42:08] we've been killed Department because the
[42:11] Word of God came to the prophets and
[42:15] when the word came to the prophets
[42:18] amen the devil wanted to get rid of the
[42:22] way so the devil they meant we'll get to
[42:27] the mind of the people and called the
[42:31] people not to believe the Prophet even
[42:34] if I can get them to reject a prophet
[42:37] then I can get them to reject the words
[42:41] because the word was in the prophets
[42:44] they meant but the Bible say he meant
[42:48] the word was in Moses and the people
[42:52] amen
[42:53] they came against Moses when they got to
[42:57] the Red Sea they said Moses why you
[43:00] brought us out here to die you should
[43:02] have left us in Egypt why because the
[43:05] word was in Moses Moses was the word God
[43:11] the children he wasn't to kill Moses
[43:23] Amen I want you to know he meant when he
[43:27] made the word come
[43:30] it's a persecuted word they made the
[43:33] word are called you to suffer
[43:35] persecution you have to go do something
[43:39] because the word as always the word
[43:45] tears sometimes you have to cry amen
[43:49] because the people don't understand the
[43:53] word got to be tried and tested yes he
[44:00] meant the word in the days of Noah it
[44:04] was a rejected word and the world no
[44:12] because he had the word and him because
[44:16] the word was in him they crucified the
[44:20] word they told the word I don't believe
[44:24] you
[44:33] [Music]
[44:36] when you walk away
[45:32] shoulder the people had gone out the
[45:36] bail showed up came down he meant a
[45:44] larger one day after amen he had done a
[45:50] great thing and turning the children
[45:54] hearts back to the way the judge by Bill
[46:00] the clad that she was going to get
[46:02] larger for what he had done and she was
[46:07] after the way she was going to get
[46:11] larger and larger just killed all the
[46:16] prophets that devil-worshipping Bale and
[46:21] when Jezebel got the Bible said he ran
[46:26] on he'd himself and he said I'm by
[46:33] myself
[46:34] Amen Lord when you little don't all got
[46:38] the law told you to do
[47:09] [Music]
[47:46] [Music]
[48:29] when you take by yourself
[48:32] that's consolation knowing in the time
[48:37] of trouble
[48:38] he's a present help I said put your
[48:45] trust in God stand for the word and

[58:12] of that devil they meant by coming and
[58:15] accepted what he done for you on the
[58:18] cross the crucified way he went to the
[58:24] cross that your sin might be forgiven
[58:28] the love of God let it come down in your
[58:33] heart and if you love God you depart
[58:38] from evil if you love God you keep its
[58:42] commanding if you love God you'll want
[58:46] to live right they'll be long gone
[58:49] you'll want to talk right he said and
[58:54] they that are Christ's have crucified
[58:56] the flesh with the affection and the
[59:00] lust if we live in the spirit let us
[59:05] also walk in the spirit the crucified
[59:10] way
[59:12] the word today if the Bible is right in
[59:20] the Dark Age is wind they wanted to pull
[59:23] the wool over the people eyes and the
[59:25] water declined the folk they took the
[59:29] Bible's awake and they put it in a
[59:32] language which the people could not
[59:34] understand until the Reformation Korea
[59:40] came and they started the printed Bibles
[59:44] in the people language they killed the
[59:49] word but the word began to rise again I
[59:55] want to say they have done despite to
[1:00:01] the word of truth the same Jesus same
[1:00:07] words they're doing not today they meant
[1:00:12] they're saying things and doing things
[1:00:17] that they called just and right
[1:00:21] they're standing there making laws amen
[1:00:28] that will take and make the Word of God
[1:00:34] look like it's against the law
[1:00:37] ah but God got a people that would not
[1:00:44] bow down they meant to the the things
[1:00:50] that the swirls God got a people that's
[1:00:55] gonna take a stand for the way they
[1:00:58] stand up because they have been obtained
[1:01:02] and they have been chosen to stand for
[1:01:06] God way you him God has called you
[1:01:12] God knew you need not know that they
[1:01:17] made you need him that you might think
[1:01:21] that you need a lot of things in this
[1:01:24] world one day the world is gonna be on
[1:01:28] fire but I know that God gonna please a
[1:01:32] shelter to hide you one day man
[1:01:38] the Bible said that made him both Lord
[1:01:40] and Christ
[1:01:43] he's my king and he's my high priest
[1:01:48] he's not and he's not Savior are you
[1:01:55] whooping he's the same Jesus you've
[1:02:00] taken with wicked hands you crucified
[1:02:03] his slave but God had raised him up
[1:02:08] meaning both Lord and Christ will you'll
[1:02:13] know him they said we don't want him
[1:02:18] crucify him
[1:02:21] somebody's saying we don't need the
[1:02:24] Bible it's too holy
[1:02:27] it ain't fair it ain't yes but we're
[1:02:33] serving a god that's a just God
[1:02:37] he's gave us his way and his word is our
[1:02:41] law
[1:02:42] but they are saying he meant is not talk
[1:02:46] it's not the model thing they make the
[1:02:50] word is dated a man is old-fashioned you
[1:02:55] can't use it for the modern day world
[1:02:59] it's too old it's been that bad not for
[1:03:04] us today but I want you to know the same
[1:03:07] Jesus the Bible said the same Jesus same
[1:03:12] yesterday and today
[1:03:16] don't let them fool you don't let the
[1:03:19] devil lie to you you don't need the Word
[1:03:23] of God you don't need the word he meant
[1:03:28] with this well catch a fire when you
[1:03:33] stand before God one day you gonna be
[1:03:36] gone and will you be ready
[1:03:41] oh yeah God you see you don't have to be
[1:03:46] lost you don't have to go to hell he's

[1:03:57] lot of sorrow but you got to come to
[1:04:00] Jesus accept the word the word of the
[1:04:03] Spy's it's rejected it's a Bleen word
