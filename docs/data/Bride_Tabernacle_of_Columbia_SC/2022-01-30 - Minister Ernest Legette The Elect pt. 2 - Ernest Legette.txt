bless us here today give us what we stand in need of father for we love you in jesus christ's name we pray amen god is good this morning we want to look at the book of matthew the 24th chapter we just kind of continue on from friday night will be the lord's will amen on the elect god gives us assurance this morning many times we worried about a lot of things but god gives us like they say that insurance deep down in your soul that he's got it all in control do you believe that this morning i believe that with all of my heart it ain't nothing that catch god by surprise come on and that's why he says he don't have to show us the way sometimes but he wants you to rest and ensure that i got it all in control you just i just need you to trust me come on how many feel like trusting the lord this morning amen matthew 24 and we'll begin here at the fourth verse and read down a little bit you got to say amen and it reads uh and jesus answered and said unto them take he that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many and ye shall have wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled come on he said the things was gonna happen but i don't want you to be troubled come on he said in one place let not your heart be troubled but if you believe in god believe also in me didn't he say that so don't be troubled this morning when these things are breaking powers are coming don't be troubled this morning come on he says for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation to rise against nation kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines pestilence earthquakes and diverse places you may be seated read down a little further that's what he says there shall be famines pestilence earthquakes and diverse places come on are we experiencing that today say earthquakes and diverse places right here in south carolina amen shaking the whole state some people just you know what happens a lot of times things be taking place and then it just becomes a norm and then we just oh that's just normal right that's like they're doing out in california scientists warned them that what's going to happen but it doesn't become the norm and what it they ain't going to really take it ain't going to really take grips to the seriousness of the hour until the big one come y'all believe that this morning come on but i believe it's somebody that's gonna that's gonna take heed before before that destruction comes somebody gonna take heed come on all these things are the beginning of sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another come on that's a strong word ain't it says many was gonna hate one another in the end come on for the income they gonna be betraying they gonna be hating come on brother against brother sister against sister mother against daughter fathers against son come on they gonna hate one another betraying one another you know it's something about always says you betrayal a lot of times we look at oh my enemies betrayed you your enemies was always your enemies betrayal that ain't betrayal betrayal comes from within those that were considered you considered your friends that's when the betrayal is really hurts then don't it the same one as the scripture says that sat at the table ate bread with him was the same one that he lifted up his heel against him that's where the hurt comes from when those that you that you consider your friends betray you that's when the hurt comes come on do you believe that this morning it says and then shall and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall white school but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness in all nations then shall the income when ye therefore see the abomination making desolation by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whosoever read and let them understand then let them which are in judea flee to the mountains let him which is in the house top not come down to take anything out of the house neither let him but he's in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child and to them that gives suck in those days but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day for then shall come great tribulation such as as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days be shortened there should be no flesh there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened then if any man should say unto you lol here is christ or there believe it not for there shall rise false christs and false prophets and show great signs and wonders if in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold i have told you before wherefore i shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not i'll just stop right there you know if you can read further on down later on in your own time jesus talking about you know well we just read no we want to talk about the elect this morning but jesus you know was asked a question because that that's been the the i believe one of the biggest questions of all time is when is the end gonna come will there be an end or when will it come come on well jesus began to declare to the disciples that you know he was saying that in one place you've read further down you're saying no man know that they know the hour not even the angels in heaven so he would he would say that no man would know the day of the hour but he would let us know what the season would be like what the atmosphere would be like when the end of the world was coming come on so as he declares to us what the world would be like when the end was coming come on i says that we ought to be spiritual enough to look around and see the signs of the time see that the conditions are right for the end come on do y'all believe that a lot of times people don't want to don't want to reckon with that but the conditions are right come on the fruit is right on the tree so jesus talking about these things and you know one thing i i said that what he did he described that before the world before the end of the world the world would be in the miss come on wars rumors of wars pestilence violence earthquakes people was going to be hating betraying one another all these things he said that's what the world was going to be like but in the midst of all of that chaos god was going to have an elect out there in the midst of all of the turmoil and the pestilence and all these things he's saying unto you this morning i don't want you to be troubled though come on i don't want you to fear you saying god how can we survive in all of that chaos that you said that's coming on the world come on but he says that if it wasn't for time being shortened no flesh should be saved that's how wicked it'll be he said but for the elect's sake even in the midst of all that darkness come on it's still a little light somewhere in the midst of all that darkness god is still looking out for you and i as individuals because we are the elect of god so you know we look at the media world today and how they bring in fear and fears gripping the world of the diseases and the pestilence and the and the things the desolation all that's coming on the world but you know in our hearts it's something that's in our hearts that we can't fear because we know that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god always lifted up a standard we ain't looking at uh what we see today but we're looking back at so many clouds of witnesses that's standing on the outskirts in the spirit that's testifying come on that all you've got to do is hold on to his unchanging hand he never failed me he will never fail you hallelujah oh jesus don't that excites you the doe that we can look at daniel come on that was stolen in the lion's den they told him not to pray he said i'ma still do what the will of god is hallelujah thrown in the lion's den we can call daniel up to testify and he can testify that in the mount in the face of lions god was still faithful the hebrew boys can testify that in the face of fire god is still faithful come on i said what you going through this morning let the saints testify that god is still faithful oh jesus hallelujah what is it about it's about the gods of light come on but we find that today i said that the world of being a mess come on we're living you know in the age where the people have put god out of his own house didn't they come on i said a lot of times go around and look and every year get worse don't it you start seeing things that you said it looked like in times past people would have felt dead maybe if they came in the house of god doing that but what it is it they don't put him out it ain't his house no more it's a house of devils ain't it come on you said if god ain't in there then who they worshiping let's be real come on singing on the choir playing music preaching the gospel so-called well they're living any kind of life come on the bible declared that in this hour they'd be lukewarm come on they wouldn't be cold nor hot in the church living hypocritical lives out there in the world living like the devil shouting on their way to heaven so they think come on but in that day they hear him say depart from me you workers of iniquity i ain't never knew you hallelujah but i say don't let that deter you this morning because somebody's real somewhere come on there's a real god somewhere that's somebody worship that's for real it's somebody that's living right do you believe that this morning hallelujah but i said that we live in that we be living in that day come on that they don't mind shouting and all these things you know that the spirit in the end time wouldn't would be a religious spirit wouldn't it come on the end time spirit wouldn't be something that would be easy to be pointed out jesus said that false christ was gonna rise come on prophets and all these things showing great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible either to see the very elect but the elect they don't look just for signs and wonders because they know the signs and the wonders they they follow those that believe come on but what is the elects the elect they love the word of god the elect they love god's word in season and out of season why because they see it as a gateway to the eternal life i believe that peter and them told jesus they said lord where are we going to go come on we know that what you're saying is hard but we ain't got nowhere else to go hallelujah and we know that thou has the keys to eternal life god give us the word that's what i want hallelujah people don't want the word today do they because of what does the word do the word gonna clean their life up the word's gonna make them quit fornicating and committing adultery we're gonna make them quit lying and cheating and stealing but the word is going to come in and clean up that heart clean up that life hallelujah and make you walk pure in front of god amen hallelujah he said straight is the gate now is the way that leaders to eternal life come on and this ain't a miserable way but it's righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost if you say i'm walking that way and i can't do this and i can't do that you're just living by rules and regulation but those that's got a revelation hallelujah they ain't miserable but they walk in that straight in that narrow way and they enjoy the trip they thanking god because they got righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost i don't know about you this morning but it's righteousness peace and joy you ought to be smiling this morning you have to be glad that god allows you to come in his house one more time come on i don't know what you come to do but i come to praise the lord hallelujah i don't know what y'all come to do what y'all come to do this morning hallelujah did you come to clap your hands come on did you come to hear god's word hallelujah oh jesus i'm just third this morning come on i'm only down here every once in a while but god is good it's good it's good to see everybody in the house of the lord this morning amen i says what it is you know we know that we're living in this in this hour and jesus declared how how the hour would be and you know we talking about the the the end time and the end time spirit would be just such a religious one come on but they would be showing great signs and wonders but jesus talked about deception too i don't want you to be deceived come on you know i was thinking about i know a certain woman preacher and how you know she's got a gift for healing and many times people are take taking their children and stuff or whatever from the hospital and where the doctors gave him up and they took him to this woman and she prayed for him come on and the lord healed him come on you say was it god come on god is the only healer right but what it is i said don't you be deceived sometimes many times people can look at that and they say well i know the lord called her to preach i know that the lord is she going to have a place in heaven that's between her and god but i know what the word of god says the word of god said i suffered not a woman to teach no use authority over a man come on no matter how much she's gifted remember gifts and callings are without repentance that don't override the word of god and that's why so many people are deceived today because of gifts come on and they let they give out i override what the word of god says but remember heaven and earth is going to pass away but the word of god is going to stand forever come on when the books were opened every man was judged by it what was it it wasn't by the book of your church or what people wrote and said about your life but you was judged by the bible come on and that's what it is even if i never been able to work one miracle and all these things right there lord when i'm george let let it be known that i live by the word of god and i stood by the word of god i did the best i could do to live according to what you asked me to live god hallelujah that's what i'm standing on is that what you're standing on this morning come on but we know that that the hour will be that way come on false christ and all these things showing signs and wonders he says but i want you to be deceived he said if it were possible it would deceive what the very elect didn't it look how close this thing would be if it were possible it'll deceive the very elect but he says that if it were possible but it's not possible what something something's got to happen the the separate you come on to open your eyes you say what it is come on the baptism of the holy ghost is the most important thing out all your shouting your dancing and singing come on you got to get the baptism of the holy ghost not just on your flesh come on the way you shout every now and then not in your spirit to speak in tongues and prophesy but it's got to go down into the soul come on because that's what the battle is over don't you know that these fleshly desires are warned against your soul come on it's trying to destroy your soul so what it is god and i don't want to just show my flesh and in my spirit god i got to have it down in my soul because that's the place that's the anchor come on in that place god takes over in that place god is on sitting in the control tower he's he's guiding the ship in that place then the devil can't deceive you why because god is taking over come on god is guiding you to the left and to the right come on ways open up you say that might look like a good way to go but the holy spirit is in control down in the bottom come on and he's guiding you saying oh that way might look prosperous but this is a hard way over here but this is my way hallelujah hallelujah oh jesus i said lead me lord i'll follow wherever you want me to go at god david said through the valley and the shadow of death i will fear no evil why because god is with me i know you with me the rod and i stabbed that covered me come on do you believe that this morning come on don't be afraid to walk through the valley in the shadow of death come on don't be afraid to walk through the fire god will be in there with you in the fire don't be afraid to walk through all these things why because he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you do you believe that this morning come on so i say is it here you know talking about the elect how it would be and all these things and you know in this hour like it says it would be such a mess come on that they put him out his own church but even in that he says behold i stand at the door not come on god has still got an elect out there he's not necessarily looking for whole churches come on people get that confused that or or either that they can ride off a ground my religion or a mama or daddy religion come on i heard saying once at a funeral that the sister was such a great sister and all these things at a funeral i was at and let it be known let her name be put on the books that god would would bless her family all these things like that come on but it don't work like that come on when you get to stand before that judge it ain't gonna be that mama stand for me come on you're gonna need to have god for yourself you're gonna need the blood gonna need to be applied to yourself you're gonna have to accept the lamb for yourself hallelujah i think about so many great people even mary the mother of jesus hallelujah but on the day of pentecost the scriptures mentioned that she was up in the upper room with him why because even though she might have been his natural mother she needed a savior herself she needed to get down on her knees and repent herself she needed the holy ghost too hallelujah how much more do you and i today need that new birth need god to do something deep down in our soul hallelujah oh jesus do you believe that this morning something something got to happen in your spirit amen i believe that something gotta happen down on on the inside come on he says there to be miserable blind naked all these things he says but they and they wouldn't even know it come on but what happens when the holy ghost comes he opens your eyes to how miserable you are how wretched and how naked you are how you need god to clothe you he opened your eyes to the condition that you're in and then you cry out oh god help me oh lord save me oh god get me away from my flesh and my desire oh god save me from my own self deliver me from my own will oh god help me god knows you need help come on if you don't think you need help then you already deceived god knows you need help god knows you can't deliver yourself god knows you can't walk on your own he said if it were possible it'll deceive even a very elect god knows that but he's saying let me come in come on i said he says behold i stand at the door and knock come on if any man would open up the door i said i was praying the other day and i said it ain't sometimes people don't have a problem with opening up the door but when he come in you got to let him feel welcome you got to make him welcome when he come in come on you can't just open up the door and don't invite him in every room come on sometimes we invite him in every room but in our personal space because in that place we don't want nobody to touch we don't want the man of god to deal with that place but i tell you what don't let that place be the reason you lose your soul come on i said when you come to god let god come in every room let the word deal with every space god come in my personal space hallelujah because he knows what's best for me do you believe that this morning i said a lot of times people don't have problems opening the door come on letting them in but the only way the only way that god can help you effectively help you come on you got to let him in every room you got to let him in that place that you don't want nobody to touch come on that place in your life where you know that struggling battles you got to let god in there you got to say here god you're welcome in my come on god knows you in bad shape come on because you were born that way do you believe that i don't know about you but like i said always say i like that song it says i came to jesus just like i was weary come on want and sad but i found in him a resting place come on god knows you in bad shape when you come to him come on so don't be ashamed to open up and let god here i am god standing before you disarmed and naked lord i need your help come on don't be afraid to let god in god he knows your barrels he knows your struggles he knows where you're he going to help you come on but you got to let them help you how many want to let the lord help them this morning amen but i see say you know we find that he's saying that you know i stand at the door knocking all these things talking about the late come on even and all that even in all that guard has still got an elect out there you know you know what happens and i say this you know i says a lot of times as individuals we play with the devil come on but you know what the devil the devil got three things he he come to do kill steal and destroy come on but yet we play with such a one as that i thought about sampson and how you know the bible talked about how delilah and how she asked him plainly not even cutting corners she asked him plainly what do i got to do the afflict you come on what do i have to do to take all your strength that you'll be like any other man she didn't use no deception she asked him plainly what i got to do come on and what it is playing with the devil he again said all you got to do that's got to do that the bible says that that she had men in the chamber lying in weight that at the time she called that they can come up and bind him and afflict them come on what it is the devil playing with the devil a lot of times come on he ain't playing with you he got demons come on sitting in the outskirt waiting on a time when you at your weakest waiting on a time with god come on it's walked away from you then what call this little demons come up and afflict you you get up thinking maybe i can go and repent as i did as other times not knowing that god has left you hallelujah demons got a hold of your life now to take the mercy of god hallelujah it gets you away but yet the whole time we were playing with the devil come on and that goes to the young and the old playing with the devil come on but god was merciful come on what me you know we start like they say we serve our awesome god we serve a merciful god come on maybe we need to add that verse into the song we serve a merciful god don't we come on a god of mercy a god that forgave you over and over and over again a god that a god of patience come on that's patient a god of long suffering that's long suffering waiting on you hallelujah i'm so glad that god had patience with me i'm so glad that god is long suffering with me i'm so glad that he's still being patient with me right now come on i'm so glad because without god's patience hallelujah aren't you glad for that patience this morning come on something about it you know and i'll skip all over myself it's for the election come on for the election i say the elect what is the lake the lake is the chosen come on you chosen of god you remember this you you didn't i want you to remember you didn't choose god but god chose you he said you have not chosen me but i've chosen you come on and he says in the book of mark that you might bring for fruit and that your fruit might remain come on and that anything you ask for the father he'll give it to you come on god has elected you you gonna bring for fruit and whatever you ask the father god he said i elected you that when you ask god to give it to you hallelujah i said why you got your mouth closed this morning don't you know that you don't lack of god you have not because you ask not what you need this morning you've been elected you can stand before god and ask what you will and god will hear your cry hallelujah problem problem is we don't ask god i don't know about you but i'm asking god i was praying yesterday lord help him lord save him god i'll mess with you this is what your word said i've been elected hallelujah to stand in the gap here i am lord standing in the gap call it out names lord don't let the devil destroy god don't let them go too far lord save them lord deliver hallelujah god has elected you the crowd hallelujah come on he said to bring forth fruit didn't he come on let's look at that i think it's mark uh mark 15 by god's grace come on i said you are the elect of god mark 15. god is good you know as being as the elect you have benefits as the elect being elect come on you got benefits that the rest of the world don't have come on you got certain rights in the kingdom that the rest of the world don't have do you believe that this morning come on why because you the elect of god god chose you you chosen come on 15 and and uh 16. oh my wrote down wrong scripture ah i did but either way you the elect of god amen he said you have not chosen me but i've chosen you come on come on and that's why i said no man you know sought god at any time come on by your choosing you didn't seek god but god chose you it was always in the nature of man to run from god do you believe that god man's nature when he failed it was just the garden of eden it's telling him running to god what did he do he ran from god but nevertheless him being made in the image of god god's elected what did god do god sought after him hallelujah he wouldn't let him stay in that condition for so long but what he did he sought after him he might have had to go through something but nevertheless god made a way of escape god made a way for for uh adam and those when they failed to get back come on it was going to be a hard way but nevertheless he made a way for them to get back and that's what it is with you and i you and i are the elect of god chosen come on we didn't seek out the god come on in no time did we seek out to him but it was him that sought after us because remember we were born in sin and all these things in times past we walked according to the lust of the flesh and all these things in the in in life that's the way we walk that was by nature who we were come on but nevertheless god come on god had elected you before the foundation of the world god had already chosen you you said you yes god has chosen you and he put something in you that the world don't know nothing about and all it was one day he began drawing on that seed that he put in you he began drawing on that life that he placed in youth before the foundation of the world you didn't go seeking after him but he began calling that deep began calling out to the deep you didn't know what it was but up under all of the mess up under all of the darkness and all these things something began to happen come on life began to grow things began to take place down on the inside something began drawing on you and you didn't know what it was but what it was it was by election that elect you were the light of god and god began calling you out hallelujah oh i'm so glad all the demons and devils they couldn't hold you down come on all of the things that were on your life they couldn't hold you back why because it was a greater he that was in you was greater than he that was in the world that see that life that was in you god was drawing on it all you had to do was quit fighting and let go and let god have his way how i'm gonna get out of it lord i don't know but god you're drawing on me draw me out lord and god began drawing you out didn't he hallelujah hallelujah come on and i'm so glad that the lord brought me up they say if it had not been for jesus as i was saying on friday night where would i be come on if it had not been for the lord i wouldn't be where i am today come on that's my testimony but what it is i'm learning now that it ain't about me and nothing that i could do it's not a work unless any man should boast but it's by grace are you saved the bible says through faith it is the gift of god come on god has given you a gift this morning god has saved you by his grace this morning and you won't give god praise come on you won't worship god because of who he is just worship him for what he done for you hallelujah i can't understand all about the scriptures are saying but i'm a worship god because of what he done for me hallelujah oh jesus hallelujah oh jesus come on god is so good come on he's so good he's so good hallelujah come on that god is so good i was telling brother simmons friday night i said you know what i said man i looked at when i got my hair cut the other day i only get it every once in a while but i said uh man i didn't know i had all these gray hairs i said they taken over he said well you know i said i got more than my brothers he said well you got more children than they but nevertheless i said what it is god is so good come on you know i walk with many they ain't had a chance to see gray hairs in the head come on but what is it god has kept me i can look back at those things i was in the midst of all of that with the same mind frame but what's the difference come on and i ain't saying god done with nobody yet but what's the difference the election come on god has called you out come on god has elected you no time did you seek out to him but he chose you come on he called you out he he recognized you as the prophet of god saying one place and when you came about he said he recognized you come on why because you were in his mind and no you didn't know who you were god was getting ready to start something come on on on the inside to start bringing back your remembrance come on that hey you in the world but you're not of the world and that's why you were never satisfied while you was out there because the only way you was going to be satisfied is that you give in to the thirst that was in your heart and the only one that could quit that thirst that was in your heart would be god and god alone why because god put it there and he made it the way it would only be quenched by him oh jesus come on i said you are the elect come on i'll say that saying that here lately for the elect's sake come on you say why is god giving a little space for the election come on why is god you look at your job why is god blessing you your job for the election come on why is god blessing the area you live in for the elect sake come on why is god blessing your family for the elect's sake hallelujah come on jesus said if you lean on me i won't let you fall come on for the elect's sake god is doing a lot of things for the let's say come on it's all about you hallelujah god is doing something here i believe god will disrupt the whole world for the election come on god have changed the whole cross course of history for the elect's sake do you believe that this morning hallelujah it says what it is come on you are chosen by god come on you're the elect of god and it's something it's something about the elect come on that distinguishes them from the rest of the world the elect has has always learned to live by faith come on the elect of god i could say they mastered the art of faith right because you know i was saying the other night that israel they they could see their enemies come on in the natural but yet even though they could see their enemies in the natural they still had to live by faith didn't they they still they could see their enemies but even though they could see them when they went before they can go out to fight and all these things they still had to have faith in god they still had to believe that god was going to do something supernatural to give them the victory in the midst of that come on in the midst of them being able to see it they knew that they weren't even able to strategize enough we still need your help god so they had to learn to live by faith didn't they and so much as they had to learn to live by faith how about you and i today come on now we ain't wrestling against flesh and blood come on but a spiritual wickedness in high places principalities and all these things but yet you and i got to live by faith hallelujah do you believe that this morning come on putting it all in the master's hands i don't know about you but that's what i'm learning to do put it all in the masters hands you know the things that's coming on the earth we ain't able to fight them come on we can't even see them how we gonna fight them but we know that we the elect of god we know that god has made us a promise come on that the whole world will be the seed but the let won't why because god is going to look out for his children so we ain't worried about what tomorrow going to bring we know that you and i we know that we are all the elect of god come on so when we pray we pray lord keep us lord watch over us it's in your hands because we are your elect hallelujah god i didn't choose you but lord you chose me out of all that you could have used god you chose me and i'm so glad that god chose me come on the elect of god come on i said they learn to live by faith come on it's something something that in our christian journey i say is that you know the way things are going like we said deception all these things hitting at once come on you watch you watch the news and all you'll have you'll have a breakdown trying to comprehend everything that they throwing at you at once come on all the darkness everything everything happening at once you'll have a breakdown trying to con but what it is our mind and focus ain't on these things come on but our mind and focus is in the word come on because that's the only safe place do you believe that this morning come on it's only one safe place and that's in the word of god come on i said i want to i called you this morning the elect come on the elect you you and i are the elect of god come on you've been chosen to make it in this hour come on god could have put you in another hour but no he put you in this hour why and he elected you to make it through this hour he said to them that endure to the end they'll be saved god has elected you to endure come on when you think about things that are happening are coming on your life that you ain't able to bear i want you to remember that god has elected you to go through those things come on and though he did i don't know how i don't know when come on but i know that god is gonna make a way i don't know how i'm gonna get out of it come on but i know that the strength giver hallelujah he's here all the time and that's what i'm depending on the strength giver i ain't depending on money come on all these things in the world because all those things are failure but i'm depending on the one that can't fail i'm depending on the one that rose from the dead and said i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also hallelujah that's what i'm dependent on this morning lord jesus christ come on is that who you depended on this morning come on the elect how many believe that this morning come on you are the elect of god come on start walking like it come on start acting like it start living like you know who you are come on walk with your head up hallelujah well like you know you got authority walk like you know you got power walk like you know you've been elected come on you bring forth fruit hallelujah and your fruit gonna remain they say some trees bury every other season come on but i believe god calls you out to bear every season hallelujah you don't have to worry about the winter months fall months all these things because your fruit gonna remain hallelujah when the master come looking for fruit you got fruit on the tree hallelujah you believe that this morning somebody give god praise hallelujah jesus let us bow our heads this morning jesus delay i said you are the elect of god this morning god knocking at the door come on the church world he had enough and they put them out but yet there's still some elect out there those that god has chosen here he comes knocking at the door of your heart don't just open the door but let them come in every space let them get
