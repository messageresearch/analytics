bless your word this morning I pray that you look down upon every hand and every heart never need in every family Lord may you meet us here this morning oh God in a special way for Lord we look to you now in Jesus Christ's name amen The Book of Revelation 5 1-9 I read the first you read the next one we'll read the ninth verse together God is good amen somehow I feel like we don't have the joy that do that we need to have as Christians because that's where our strength is Nehemiah said the joy the Lord is our strength praise God and we got to find ourselves able to press over what all we've been through and all we're going through to realize that Lord I Thank you for what you've given me and Lord I appreciate what I have because someone somewhere don't have what we have and they wish they could but thank God the God has blessed you with what you have and just be grateful this morning for what God has given you now Revelation 5 and 1 it says and I saw in the right hand of him that set up on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals too and no man in Heaven Nor in Irv neither under the Earth was able to open the book needle to look their own for and one of the elders said unto me we've not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals there of six and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set it on the throne eight together and they sung a new song saying thou worthy to take the book in the open seals thereof and thou slain and redeemed us by the blood out of every kindreds tongues and people and Nations God bless the Remus word amen the prophet of God was talking about the book of redemption amen and we know that the Bible has the the plan of God it tells us where we come from it tells us amen while we're here and it tells us where we're going amen to see the difference in the Bible than the other books all of them had prophets and great people but the Bible Jesus Christ was not just your Prophet but he was the son of God but he died everybody else is left with the grave but Jesus died and he rose up out of the grave are you with me and you will tokens and you the evidence proof that he rose why because the same life that was in him when you accept him that life comes down in you and I as believe us and because of his life and because of his dying the penalty was paid now I want to talk about the book of redemption the book of redemption you might say what is the book of redemption this is the title deed this is the title deed it's the abstract title deed you say abstract what does an abstract means it mean it's search all the way back to its beginning are you with me set you all the way back to the beginning it's just like a little drop of ink The Struck in Bleach when it's always back and when sin has been confessed and fallen in to the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives an abstract right back to the Creator again and you become sons of God Amen the abstract title deed is held in the hand of the Almighty amen it's Redemption it means all legal possessions to all that was lost by Adam and Eve are y'all with me all legal possessions that was lost by Adam and Eve sometimes it's the understanding of a Christian Christians doesn't they don't understand their legal rights and what it means to be a Christian that's why you focuses you don't understand the need or the warrant or the desire to be a Christian and then some that say I'm a Christian but does not they don't understand the legal rights and what it means to be a Christian sometimes it a Christian it means I don't drink no more I don't smoke no more and I maybe I stop lying but it means more much more than that it goes far beyond drinking smoking and cursing and lying and stealing it goes beyond that you know sometimes they say well you know it it sometimes Christian folk seem like they're missing out on the world so many things that I can experience and I can do and so evidently most young people it's not appealing to you there's nothing that I would like to be because it takes away all my joy and all my foreign of life it just it looked like it's sad who would want to be something that looks so look so dull and so boring and so I want to be that because what they see is you know the desire the nature that's in us that we were born with they just don't gravitate it it's not just not a graph we don't gravitate to to the things of God because our nature well we were born in sin shaping iniquity our desires and was to do the things of our flesh the things of the world because what happened Adam our and Eve fell to sin and they lost their inheritance what were they were their inheritance they inherited the Earth they had it they had Dominion everything going to them but because of sin they lost their inheritance and it went back into the hand of the original owner Satan could not get it but Satan because of his deception he claims the Earth are you with me so he claims to have dominion over you are you with me but he could not get that abstract kind of deed are you with me it wasn't rightful of his and he cannot get it it was Adam's indeed God gave it to them and we know that God put a chair of them before the garden that they could not go eat of the tree of life and live forever are you with me so man could not get back to the Tree of Life there was no way it was a blockage God Blocked that So Adam and Eve ate of the tree of knowledge and good and evil and when they ate up the tree of knowledge and good and evil we find that everybody that was born was born in sin shaping and iniquity because of what had done what was done are you okay so everybody that was born of a woman amen was born in sin shaping their nicotine but Jesus Christ was born by a virgin are you with me a woman that does not have a seed had a seed and that seed was Christ are you with me Jesus did it looked like with man The Impossible but the word of God had prophesied and said the Divergence shall conceived and shall have a son and have a child amen and a virgin did but the world simply because we were born in America we just take it for granted that we believe it we believe it because we go to church and that's all we heard all of our lives but do we really believe it why was it important that a virgin have a child we needed a Kinsmen Redeemer we needed somebody to bring us back to God and John looked and there was no man could take the book no man could look their own if nobody could get this book they couldn't even look on it they couldn't read it they couldn't look on it but nothing so the Bible itself is that book that was sealed up with Seven Seals now we notice that the book was sealed in Revelation 10 1 let's look there for a minute I'm talking to you because I want you to understand your redempted rights now I said it was the abstract title deed to the Earth God when he made man he didn't make him in heaven he made man here on the earth isn't that right and he gave him dominion over the what heaven no the Earth are you with me we want to go to heaven right I want to go to heaven when I die amen we can go to heaven but that's not our Dominion that's not what God gave us are you with me he gave us dominion over the Earth that's why John said I saw a new Heaven A New Earth come down from God out of heaven are you with me why the Earth is being purified and burnt with fire amen then we're in heaven for the marriage supper of the Lamb are you with me without until this is cleaned up all these demon powers and all of that has to are you with me then we come back to dwell here are you with me y'all with me Revelation 10 1 it says the book that was sealed he said and I saw another a mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet and Spilled the fire and he had in his hand a what a little book what now in Revelation 5 the book was what it was closed it was sealed amen but in Revelation 10 is open it must be a time period when the sealed book becomes an open book are you with me so what was God if we would have known the Rapture wasn't going to take place in the days of Paul and apostles in 2000 in every uh period of History uh the Christians was looking for Jesus to come back and take the church in the rapture take us to heaven and and that you know the disciples they knew that God there was a kingdom to come he said pray thy kingdom come thy will be done pray that God would you know restore the kingdom to Israel praying you know there was an expectation they were looking forward to something to lay whole to claim job even when when his Crest when all he was going through he said I know that my redeemer lived and then he talks about it and I shall stand upon the Earth in the latter day are you with me so it was a looking forward to the Redeemer to come and redeem mankind are you with me so it was always in the heart of man that the Messiah the Jews said the Messiah would come and when the Messiah come he gonna do something he's going to liberate us when we talk about Redemption and we talk about being redeemed what is it it's it free us from guilt and the power of sin to free you from guilt and the power of sin are you a man because when you hold your head down to all that you've done a lot of times the reason why folks amen do the things they do because of guilt somewhere in the back of their mind they meant the devil will oppress you he'll put you in bondage because you feel guilty sometimes we're guilty in the life that we live we made so many uh uh mistakes and so many things that it hurts within us in us why did I do this and why did I do that and it hurts so we're real pain and in the inside it sometimes the pain is uh uh uh we we don't come in contact with it because it's psychological pain it's a mental pain it's mental illness it's not a physical sickness the pain that comes in the rims of the spirit it it makes your soul sink it makes the heart ache see sometimes physical physical sickness and and mental sickness come from sin's sake or you have been so uh well it's many things that cause us they meant sin bought about attributes and those attributes of sin those out there [ __ ] was death because Africans to sorrow amen so sin without sin we would have no sickness we would have no death we'll have no pain we have no sorrow Adam did not know what it means Amen to be sick so Amen to have sorrow to have pain amen Eve didn't know nothing about that they just had life eternal life so they didn't know nothing about that but when they disobeyed God then all of that began to occur now in the book of redemption that he had in his hand we said Redemption is in two parts one part he died on the cross shedded his blood that he might pay the ransom and the penalty for our sins are you with me he raps in us he paid the penalty when he died and shedded his blood he ransons us amen because there was a Rants and there was a price that uh we had to pay for sin and nobody could pay that price of The Sinner to get the book of redemption to nobody can look down nobody was worried to get it no man could get it no angel could get it because it'd have to be a Kinsmen can't even Redeemer are you with me and so brothers and sisters it doesn't matter how many tears were crying John said I wept because there was nobody waiting and brother and sister if amen the lamb did not come forth amen and take the book we couldn't be redeemed it was because the Lamb of God John said the comet to take away the sins of the world and they didn't just come to take our sins away but he come Amen to do the redempted work to bring us back to our inheritance to what Adam and Eve lost our inheritance are you with me we weren't supposed to be shooting and killing and robbing and stealing and doing all of this stuff on drugs and you know doing all kind of uh uh stuff that we but we were in bondage bondage with amen by sin and by the devil amen we need Deliverance and Redemption speaks of deliverance from bondage so he comes to deliver us to get us out of that bondage that we could be delivered we can be set free we don't have to be a victim anymore in it for what we were born into sin amen we didn't do nothing but we were born that way amen and I was saying brother we couldn't do nothing to help ourselves and to get out of that condition but amen one that was worth it was the Lamb of God he said Thou Are Worthy we song that song Lord you wagy you're where did they take the book Hallelujah he's working this morning Lord have mercy you why to God thank God that we've got a god praise God when nobody's worthy we're not worthy of Salvation we're not worthy amen but thank God because he was Worthy Hallelujah I'm so glad he was Worthy praise God took my place in your place amen he saw us in our bondage he saw us in our corruption amen because amen we were corrupt and we were sinful by Nature even all of sin and come short of the glory of God but God wanted to restore our Glory by Hallelujah when he made man he said man amen he looked out of me he made him in his own image in his own likeness in God Amen saw everything that was good amen I wonder if he looked at you today what he said oh it's good amen but if he looks at you through the blood he'll see that you justify you're Sanctified you delivered you're set free praise God I look at the Son of God of God because I'm looking at you through the blood of Jesus and I've sent to his blood amen it goes to the Clorox your sins have dropped into the blood of Jesus and he made you widered in snow hey Hallelujah to take away all our devilish desires Amen to take away all our uh oh deception and stuff that we were in bondage we couldn't help ourselves we had to do it we couldn't help ourselves we we were victims of circumstances Bound By Nature the nature of our fathers our mothers and the nature of Adam and Eve and a fallen nature a sinful nature we were corrupt by Nature amen but God brought about a way through the blood of Jesus that we can have God's nature the divine nature of God through the blood of Jesus Christ oh God wanted to restore wanted to bring you back to your rightful place Hallelujah you don't have to be a sinner this morning Hallelujah you can be a saint amen you can be a child a daughter a son and a daughter of God almighty praise God and God gives you Victory gives you power leave and he gives you to amen victory over the devil the power to tell the devil no thank you why do I say no thank you because I've been set free Hallelujah I couldn't say that in time fast no thank you Temptation was it it hired me I could not resist temptation I had nothing to resist with so I fell into temptation because I did not have that amen I didn't know the effects of the blood I didn't know the meaning of the blood I didn't know amen that I've been delivered and I had a savior that cared that amen he delivered me from that oh yes I've been delivered what about you friend amen I get shocked at what he'd done praise God hallelujah yes I had nothing to do with that old sinful nature amen that I was born with but thank God Hallelujah I couldn't get myself out neither could I put myself in amen when I was in sin I couldn't get myself out of it amen but Jesus Christ came and paid my pies he paid the penalty what if you have excess somebody says well you got access to a billion dollars because amen I want to give it to you for you an inheritance a billionaire you're building a billionaire and you can say if my being a billionaire don't cost me my soul then you can have your billion isn't that right because I'm worth more than that you can give me the whole world and it couldn't pay the price of my soul are you with me my soul to me is more valuable amen than all this world Amen because it's worth more than ten thousand worlds are you with me your soul is more valuable amen but if you don't know that then the devil would lie to you and the devil would have you in Born This the devil will keep you blind if you don't want to see amen but Amen to thank you for Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound they'll save the racks like me I was blind but now amen thank God Amen that we can see that Jesus loved me this I know for the Bible tells me so I'm so glad that I'm introduced to the love of God and that through the love of God I know that when I couldn't help myself that Jesus helped me praise God I know where my help comes from amen amen that's what David could look even before he came and died on the cross he said I'll lift my eyes to the heels for what's cometh my help amen for my help come from the Lord praise God I'm saying brother sister he's a present helper in the time of trouble he's a present help praise God we got somebody that can help you no matter your condition no matter your situation but he either had a private health Hallelujah praise God God come down from glory to come down to help you and I come down to deliver you and I but there are some that would rather trust in their flesh because they don't see amen the omnipotence amen praise God of his power they don't see amen amen the glory that God wants to reveal in them oh I can't help myself oh yes the glory that God wants to reveal in here they made the power that he wants to manifest in your life amen praise God God wants to Deuce amen something inside of you God wants to take care amen he wants to make you over again Hallelujah God wants to amen put you amen amen in Heavenly places God wants to lift you up out of amen amen destruction and make you in this truck the ball amen praise God from corruption to incorruption from quantity and mortality even from my sinful nature to Divine Nature then I praise God from witness to power praise God wants to lift you up God wants to set you free amen but you got to say Lord I believe you can do it Lord I know you can do it Lord I know amen that you're worthy amen praise God you're worried to take that book and I can have

let the lawyer search the title and when they set the title they said it's got some liens on it and when it got some liens on it that means you can never get a clear title or you would be but this

if you don't accept your forgiveness then you'll still be a sinner you can sit around and said oh yeah Jesus died for me I know Jesus loved me but you don't never accept it receive it are you with me it's got to be you making the effort to Lord I believe it and not receive amen you as my Lord my savior I accept amen what you've done for me praise God other than that you remain in your sins you remain in bondage you'll keep coming to church year in and year out and not realizing the magnitude of your Redemption amen you don't know amen I'm not just coming to church to get a little feeling and say I received the Holy Ghost sin amen receiving the Holy Ghost is more than just saying I received the Holy Ghost it means that you receive amen praise God all that Adam lost are you with me and the Holy Ghost is a seal they meant to seal you to the day of redemption are you with me amen is to keep you amen praise God and that's what God will keep you if you go far enough and you just go part the way amen that means you Glimpse at the promised land but you didn't go all the way into the promise God had given you the land but you didn't never amen go into the inheritance that God gave you you just glimpsed at it see sometimes we don't go far enough to get what God has given us and you say well I I tried it's not about you I will effort we didn't we couldn't do nothing to redeem ourselves it's none of our effort it's all been paid for it's all free only thing you got to do just keep on leaving amen as long as you keep believing you can keep on receiving are you with me but when you begin to doubt amen you lose it out are you up now and that's what happens people die and lose out but as long as you keep believing the devil got no choice but to release it Hallelujah he can't hold you in that he's got the relationship praise God because you've got the abstract amen you got the abstract Amen to your healing to your salvation to all that Adam loves saying that you got
