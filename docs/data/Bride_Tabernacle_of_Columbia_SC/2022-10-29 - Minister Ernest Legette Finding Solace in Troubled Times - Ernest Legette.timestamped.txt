[3:28] seat of the scornful but his Delight is
[3:31] in the law of the Lord and in this law
[3:33] does he meditate day and night
[3:36] he shall be like a tree planted by the

[30:40] Dad they communicated with her they
[30:42] didn't talk to her he said well they

[30:53] God's still working miracles ain't he
[30:56] amen we'll share a little bit that
[30:58] tonight
[30:59] Genesis 32 by by the grace of God
[31:03] 32 and let's begin here at the
[31:06] at the 10th verse if you got to say Amen
[31:10] and it reads I am not worthy of the
[31:13] least of all the mercy and love and
[31:15] kindness
[31:16] and all the faithfulness which you have
[31:19] shown to your servant for
[31:25] forgive me
[31:26] I'm reading not an amplified version
[31:29] forgive me
[31:31] I am not worthy of the least of all thy
[31:34] mercies and of all the truth which thou
[31:37] has showed unto thy servant for with my
[31:40] staff I have passed over this Jordan and
[31:43] now and become two bands deliver me I
[31:46] pray thee from the hand of my brother
[31:49] from the hand of Esau for I fear Him
[31:52] lest he come and smite me and the mother
[31:55] with the children you may be seated
[31:57] tonight
[32:00] I like that how Jacob said I'm not
[32:02] worthy of the least of thy mercies and
[32:04] all the truth which thou has showed unto
[32:06] me unto thy servant
[32:08] let's drop down to the 22nd verse
[32:13] and it reads and he rose up that night
[32:16] and took his two wives and his two woman
[32:19] servants and eleven sons and passed over
[32:22] the forge a book and he took them and
[32:25] sent them over the brook and sent over
[32:28] that he had and Jacob was left alone and
[32:32] there Wrestled a man with him until the
[32:35] breaking of the day and when he saw that
[32:37] the angel prevailed not against him he
[32:40] touched the hollow of his thigh and the
[32:42] hollow of Jacob style was out of joint
[32:44] as he wrestled with him and he said let
[32:47] me go for the day breaking and he said I
[32:50] will not let thee go except thou bless
[32:52] me and he said unto him what is thy name
[32:55] and he said Jacob and he said thy name
[32:59] shall be called No More Jacob but Israel
[33:02] without for as a prince has thou power
[33:05] with God and with men and has prevailed
[33:08] may God have the bless you to reading of
[33:10] his word again amen tonight by the grace
[33:13] of God you know we just like I said we
[33:16] just still stirred in our hearts and
[33:18] spirits and you know uh this is
[33:21] something that I ministered on the other
[33:23] week and I titled it finding finding
[33:26] solace in troubled times amen
[33:29] finding solace in troubled times so when
[33:31] we're talking about Solace we're talking
[33:33] about you know uh peace in the midst of
[33:37] of what should be sadness or troubles
[33:41] that you know things that should upset
[33:43] you but you find Solace so you find you
[33:48] find something that settles you you find
[33:50] something that you can have comfort in
[33:52] so tonight that's what we want to talk
[33:54] about is fine and solace in troubled
[33:57] times you know I said that in many many
[34:00] people in in when they're going through
[34:03] or when they're in trouble or when
[34:05] they're having uh things in their life
[34:08] heavy everybody has a go-to
[34:11] whether you know it or not that's what
[34:13] we call it I call it a go-to you got
[34:15] everybody got something that they leaned
[34:18] on to help pull them out of of the rut
[34:21] that they're in or pull them out so far
[34:23] as a way of their mind of getting them
[34:26] out of the where they where they're at
[34:28] and many times that go-to for an
[34:31] individual might be alcohol
[34:34] or it might be drugs or it might be you
[34:38] know a woman or a man or something and
[34:40] that's where they find their Solace at
[34:42] that they can find that that's what
[34:44] their go-to is but and we've seen that
[34:47] many times because we've we saw that you
[34:50] know even we've witnessed it that major
[34:53] tragedies happen and after those
[34:56] tragedies you know people become
[34:59] alcoholic so become like we say drug
[35:01] addicts or something so devastating
[35:03] happen to them that that they they they
[35:06] they they couldn't recover from it but
[35:09] the thing what that they used as a go-to
[35:11] they didn't realize that you know I says
[35:14] that yo you can try to find Solace and
[35:17] alcohol
[35:18] but when the alcohol is gone
[35:22] or when you can try to find Solace and
[35:25] drugs but when the high is gone
[35:27] you can find try to find solace in a
[35:30] woman or a man or any other thing else
[35:32] but when it's gone
[35:34] that problem gonna still be there
[35:37] that hurt or that pain or whatever is
[35:40] upset you it's gonna still be there
[35:43] because it that what you look for to
[35:46] Define solace and couldn't give you real
[35:49] peace
[35:50] it couldn't give you the rest or
[35:52] whatever you needed to deal with the
[35:54] situation amen so I say it's fine and
[35:58] Solace and troubled times you know like
[36:00] was saying the other night troubled
[36:02] times are coming
[36:03] you know the Bible says that many are
[36:05] the afflictions are the Righteous right
[36:07] but the Lord gonna deliver them from
[36:09] them all
[36:10] he said all that little Godly gonna
[36:13] suffer persecution right
[36:15] so the thing is it's not that you know
[36:17] God didn't promise us a cakewalk did he
[36:20] but he he promised he he said it's going
[36:23] to be a battlefield you know just
[36:25] paraphrasing it that we're going to be
[36:27] on so we know that in this battle in
[36:29] this battle or this war that we fight
[36:31] and it's going to be some casualties
[36:32] it's gonna be some hard times you know
[36:35] in the battle you talk to some of those
[36:37] soldiers it's going to be some times
[36:39] where you might have to go without water
[36:42] or you might have to go without food
[36:44] it's gonna be some times where you might
[36:46] get into some conflicts or shootouts
[36:49] where you don't know if you're gonna
[36:50] make it out alive or not
[36:52] but nevertheless when you're in the
[36:54] middle of that sometimes you can't
[36:56] reckon that's why they try to tell the
[36:58] boys get your minds clear have
[37:01] everything locked down at home they like
[37:03] to choose a lot of people that don't
[37:04] even have a family because they know
[37:07] that you know those times you got a
[37:09] family and things like that when you're
[37:10] in the middle of the battle you're going
[37:11] to be more concerned about that then you
[37:14] are the the fight that you're in and
[37:16] you'll most likely uh uh be killed too
[37:18] so we find that you know I said that's
[37:22] what we own we're on a battle we're in a
[37:24] battle a battle Saints you know it's
[37:26] easy when the Sun is up and and the sun
[37:30] is shining bright the praise God
[37:32] it's easy to shout and dance when it's
[37:34] sunny outside
[37:36] but when the rain began to fall
[37:39] you know I was on my knees it says when
[37:41] it when uh I was I was praying and I
[37:44] said Lord the rain has fallen
[37:46] and I said the waves are crashing
[37:49] you know and that seemed like I can hear
[37:51] something say to me and it's gonna get
[37:53] worse than this
[37:55] but even though I I seem like I can hear
[37:58] something say to me that I began to say
[38:00] but nevertheless the anchor holds
[38:04] I say to myself nevertheless the winds
[38:07] might get harder the waves might crash
[38:11] even harder but it ain't gonna knock me
[38:14] off for that anchor
[38:15] it might move you to the left or to the
[38:17] right but that anchor
[38:20] that which down inside of you not that
[38:22] I'm holding on to hit but something's
[38:24] got a hold of me
[38:26] and no matter how much the wind blow the
[38:28] waves crash I I ain't worried about that
[38:31] because I already know that he is a
[38:33] keeper
[38:34] that when I when it feels like sometimes
[38:36] you know you don't even have strength in
[38:39] your mind don't you know God to keep
[38:40] your mind
[38:41] gotta come down and he'll change the way
[38:44] you're looking at the situation
[38:46] change the way you're looking at the the
[38:48] whole thing because you know what it is
[38:50] it's the Holy Ghost
[38:52] I believe that you know all that we've
[38:55] been dealing with I said you know the
[38:57] greatest sermon that could ever be
[38:58] preached is you must be born again
[39:01] because of the reason being you know
[39:04] when things start coming you know and
[39:06] all that you ain't gonna be able to hold
[39:07] on
[39:08] you ain't gonna be able to hold out
[39:10] it's gonna have to be the spirit of God
[39:12] in you keeping you
[39:14] and that's why it says a lot of times we
[39:16] go on go on and play Church go on and go
[39:20] on and and put that on the back side
[39:22] great sermons and all that but it's
[39:25] going to take the spirit of God when
[39:27] things start shattering when things
[39:29] start shaking it's going to take the
[39:31] Holy Ghost to keep you come on how many
[39:34] believe that tonight I know it that's
[39:36] what it's going to take to keep you
[39:38] because you can't keep yourself so
[39:40] that's what it is get God while you got
[39:43] a chance come on don't wait till the
[39:45] Storm come and then you're gonna get
[39:47] knocked out but when the Holy Spirit is
[39:50] is falling while it's present now I say
[39:52] get God right now come on then when when
[39:55] the things start rolling you got
[39:58] something to keep you to hold you you
[40:01] got something on the inside of you
[40:02] that's giving you strength you don't
[40:04] know where that strength came from
[40:06] come on but I say is what it is tonight
[40:08] I didn't don't want to be long but I
[40:10] said fight finding solace in troubled
[40:12] times you got to have a go-to come on
[40:15] you got to have something that you find
[40:17] solace in that you know that that uh hey
[40:21] I always can go to this and I know this
[40:24] is going to bail me out I know that's
[40:26] gonna help me right here in my time of
[40:28] trouble I know this right here ain't
[40:30] gonna gonna let me go under no matter
[40:32] what you know I was looking at something
[40:34] and then Navy Seals was saying they find
[40:37] solace in the gunships away above them
[40:40] because they said that when they in
[40:42] trouble
[40:43] says that they and they they boxed in
[40:45] one time on every side and says that
[40:48] they was about to run out of bullets but
[40:50] they said that they find solace in those
[40:52] gunships they said they can call in air
[40:54] strikes and all that and it says that's
[40:57] one thing that the enemy don't know that
[40:59] because it's so far flying so high above
[41:02] them that it says that all they got to
[41:04] do is call it in and help is on the way
[41:07] come on and said they said those
[41:09] gunships saved so many lives but I began
[41:12] to think about that I said you know
[41:14] those guys felt good about that they had
[41:17] help far high above them watching down
[41:20] over them Hallelujah I began to say that
[41:23] you know we got something better than
[41:24] the gunships we got something better
[41:27] than that and I say is that he's not
[41:29] just high above him but he's near us
[41:32] Even in our mouth the word of faith come
[41:34] on but it's solace in that that when you
[41:37] boxed in on every side come on when you
[41:40] perplex when you cast down you know you
[41:43] ain't gonna be destroyed you know that
[41:45] what it is you know that God Is Watching
[41:48] Over You you know that God is there all
[41:51] he is is like like those boys say they
[41:53] they call him on the radio but all God
[41:55] is is a prayer away come on say hey we
[41:58] need some help down here we boxed in on
[42:01] every side the enemy is fighting us on
[42:04] every corner and God we about to run out
[42:06] of bullets we're about to run out of
[42:08] strength Lord we need your help come on
[42:10] we calling in Lord we need it we need it
[42:13] God we need your help and don't you know
[42:15] God God will never fail you come on I
[42:18] like that how God told Joshua once he
[42:21] said I won't fail thee it's something
[42:24] about God God won't fail you everybody
[42:27] else will failure everything else will
[42:29] failure but God won't y'all believe that
[42:31] tonight come on I said but you got to
[42:33] find Solace what is your go-to tonight
[42:35] you know I was thinking of of here you
[42:38] know reading about Jacob and how you
[42:42] know he was in trouble times wasn't he
[42:44] he was at a time you know a fearful
[42:47] fright of frightening time uh in his
[42:50] walk because you know he was going out
[42:53] and had to meet Esau but I like how he
[42:56] began to pray and say Lord you know I
[42:58] ain't worthy of the least of your
[42:59] mercies are all the truth that you've
[43:02] been showing showing me but you know he
[43:05] was in trouble times but in his troubled
[43:07] times he knew where to find Solace at
[43:10] didn't you he knew that God you promised
[43:13] me you the one told me to come back and
[43:15] go back amongst my people and you was
[43:17] going to bless me there you know you go
[43:19] on your reading he said Lord you said
[43:21] you was gonna my seed was gonna be here
[43:23] and so many God this is what yo this is
[43:25] what you promised you promised God that
[43:28] you'll protect me come on and here I am
[43:30] in troubled times Lord I need your
[43:32] protection
[43:33] but you know he found himself but I like
[43:36] how the Bible says that he got alone
[43:39] and when he got alone you know he
[43:41] wrestled there with him with with a man
[43:43] but in his wrestling you know it was
[43:48] something about him he wasn't going to
[43:49] quit until he found comfort
[43:52] he wasn't gonna quit stop until he knew
[43:56] I believe that something changed
[43:59] that something happened
[44:00] in them so that's why he began to say to
[44:04] him I ain't gonna let you go until you
[44:06] bless me come on I said the Lord in
[44:09] troubled times you get to that place you
[44:12] get to that point in your spirit the way
[44:15] you say God ain't gonna stop until you
[44:16] bless us
[44:18] Lord I ain't gonna stop until I hear a
[44:21] word from you
[44:22] we in trouble times and God this this is
[44:25] what your word said Lord you promised
[44:27] God we uh we need Solace you know going
[44:30] through all of these things
[44:32] that we've been dealing with and I says
[44:34] you know some of the guys at work you
[44:37] know they began to say
[44:38] Ernest
[44:39] to me that says what if God what if God
[44:42] don't do it you know with your mom and
[44:45] things don't turn out right
[44:47] they say are you your you and the family
[44:50] prepared to take that and you know I
[44:54] thought about it and I said you know
[44:56] we'll cross that hurdle when if if we
[44:59] get if we have to come to it but I begin
[45:01] to think about it at work there and you
[45:04] know I had a moment
[45:06] but I went out in my car
[45:08] and you know what I said to myself
[45:10] I sitting in the car I said Lord I need
[45:13] I said Lord I need a word from you
[45:16] I said God I need Solace right now
[45:19] so what I did I picked up the Bible
[45:22] and I just opened it up
[45:24] and I began to read and the place where
[45:26] I opened it up it began to to say in
[45:30] that place let's lay aside every week
[45:32] that's so easily beset you
[45:34] come on and then it goes on to say
[45:37] looking unto Jesus who is the author and
[45:40] the finisher of our faith
[45:42] and talking about the suffering that he
[45:45] went through but he was willing to
[45:47] endure those things
[45:49] and I said Lord that's where my Solace
[45:51] is he says lay aside every week I'll
[45:54] begin right there in the car I said Lord
[45:56] I'm laying aside every week
[45:57] and I said God I'm looking to you
[46:00] because you are the author in the
[46:01] finisher of my faith God I got faith in
[46:04] you but right there what happened Solace
[46:07] came
[46:08] right there you know I I received
[46:12] something that alcohol couldn't give you
[46:14] that drugs couldn't give you that no man
[46:16] couldn't give you but what it is I found
[46:18] solace in the word of God I found real
[46:22] peace in the word and I said Lord you
[46:24] know I began to say no matter what what
[46:27] you do
[46:27] no matter how the outcome is I said God
[46:30] I'll be pleased with it because you
[46:33] don't make no mistakes
[46:34] don't you know God don't make no
[46:36] mistakes
[46:37] that everything I was I was looking at
[46:39] something I says everything
[46:42] you know the Bible says all things work
[46:44] together for what for the good right
[46:47] unto them that love the Lord I said
[46:49] everything it in life you know God don't
[46:53] just do things but they got a purpose
[46:56] God knew situations was going to happen
[46:59] before they even happened God already
[47:01] knew it
[47:02] he already knew it these these these
[47:05] predestinated trials we're going through
[47:07] things to do what to perfect you
[47:10] God a lot of times shows you things in
[47:13] yourself that you didn't even know was
[47:15] there you know the prophet God was
[47:17] talking about in the desperation time he
[47:20] says you know you can claim what you got
[47:23] he says but when the real emergency
[47:24] comes he says that we'll see what we'll
[47:27] see what whatever's in in you when the
[47:30] real emergency comes that's what's going
[47:31] to come at you you want to see what a
[47:34] man made of let the real emergency come
[47:36] come on but that's how God tries us and
[47:40] and he brings out of you what's in you
[47:42] so I said that's why I believe David
[47:44] said Thy word have I hid in my heart
[47:46] that I might not sin against you come on
[47:50] when the word is in your heart when the
[47:52] emergency comes then we're gonna see
[47:54] what's in you nothing gonna come at you
[47:56] but the word why because that's what's
[47:58] in you
[48:00] y'all believe that the word gonna come
[48:03] out you you have no other choice but to
[48:05] keep the word because the word is in you
[48:07] you got no other choice but to trust God
[48:10] because that's what's in you you don't
[48:12] have no other options
[48:14] no other way to go but I said that you
[48:17] know we we find that like it says fine
[48:19] and Solace we find that that that
[48:22] everything works together for the good
[48:24] these predestinated trials all these
[48:27] things you're going through right they
[48:28] doing they're doing something to perfect
[48:30] you
[48:31] you got to let God work on you because
[48:34] God is bringing something out of you
[48:36] even with all we've been dealing with
[48:37] God began to deal with me on some things
[48:40] and show me some areas in my life I was
[48:43] I was thanking God for my wife and she's
[48:46] she was pointing out some things and
[48:48] showing me some things about myself come
[48:50] on but I say is that God's God's got a
[48:52] way of doing things I was talking to my
[48:55] dad last night it was riding last night
[48:58] and I was like do you know Dad however
[49:00] God whatever God's got to do or however
[49:03] God do it come on I says that we're
[49:06] going to be satisfied with it I says but
[49:08] what we got to do is take what God's
[49:10] doing and build on it come on don't go
[49:14] back well we got to go forward
[49:17] whatever God whatever God is doing we
[49:19] got to go forward I says you know
[49:20] everything worked together for the good
[49:22] of them that love God everything's got a
[49:25] purpose I says no matter what it is I
[49:27] was looking at uh today at Joseph his
[49:30] life I says you know him being sold into
[49:34] slavery by his Brethren right
[49:37] that all of it had a purpose that was
[49:40] going to work together
[49:41] but now they couldn't see that purpose
[49:45] and it might have took years and it did
[49:47] I I even looked it up it took almost 17
[49:51] years for that purpose to come in the
[49:53] full
[49:54] a manifestation for them to really him
[49:56] to really see what the purpose of that
[49:58] was right 17 years I think he was 17
[50:01] when he went down to uh sold into
[50:05] slavery the Bible says Genesis I think
[50:07] it's uh I wrote it down but anyway
[50:10] Genesis 37 he was he was 17 years old
[50:15] when he sold out there right maybe
[50:17] thinking that's hard but remember God's
[50:19] got a purpose in everything right but he
[50:22] was only he he was 30 years old when he
[50:25] stood before Pharaoh now this 13 years
[50:27] later all the hardships that he might
[50:30] have gone through being lied on put in
[50:33] prison forgotten about all those things
[50:36] I could see him sometimes maybe looking
[50:38] at his life you know and maybe say Lord
[50:41] why me but we know that God blessed him
[50:44] no matter where he went couldn't see the
[50:47] purpose of it right from the beginning
[50:48] right but years later years later he can
[50:53] look back right and his brother in the
[50:56] nose uh after he revealed himself to him
[50:59] and they were afraid of him and thought
[51:00] he gonna kill him and all this but he
[51:03] began to tell his Brethren hey he says
[51:06] this wasn't y'all this was the Lord's
[51:08] doing
[51:10] he said y'all didn't y'all didn't sell
[51:12] me like that but God sent me down here
[51:15] because he already knew what was up
[51:18] ahead God preserved we couldn't see it
[51:20] from the beginning
[51:21] we couldn't see the purpose in the wide
[51:24] all this from the beginning and why all
[51:25] this happened from the beginning but God
[51:27] had a purpose in it now we see the
[51:30] purpose and what God is doing so that's
[51:32] why I said we don't kick up against God
[51:35] right we know that God's got a purpose
[51:37] and no matter what he's doing the trials
[51:40] what the things you faced with God's got
[51:42] a purpose in it and you might not see
[51:44] the purpose for years and if the Lord
[51:46] should tear it but nevertheless you got
[51:48] to understand that God is doing
[51:50] something come on God ain't done what
[51:53] you get Hallelujah I was telling telling
[51:56] my mom when I seen her the other day
[51:58] after they took the the vent off of her
[52:03] because they called they told me that
[52:05] morning you know that what they was
[52:06] wanting to do a uh or they were they
[52:09] were just saying you know the
[52:10] possibilities of what they might have to
[52:12] do
[52:13] right traits and all that stuff all
[52:15] things so you know but he was like just
[52:17] give us we'll just wait a couple more
[52:19] days and but then they called me and I
[52:22] talked with them that morning and they
[52:23] were saying well we ain't gonna do the
[52:25] day we ain't gonna take her off today
[52:26] he's gonna wake her up and and you know
[52:29] and all these things and then next thing
[52:30] you know they called me about three
[52:32] o'clock in the afternoon and they said
[52:34] well she doing so good we want to go and
[52:36] take it out today
[52:38] so I was like well yeah let's you go
[52:40] outside I'll be up there you know in
[52:42] about an hour you know taking me about
[52:44] two hours to get up there but when I got
[52:46] up there and
[52:47] you know and and she was doing so good
[52:50] and I walked in the room and they began
[52:52] to tell her they said look who come to
[52:53] see you and the first thing I said to
[52:55] her when I saw her I said you ain't done
[52:57] yet
[52:59] you know but what it is because I says
[53:01] that God still got a purpose come on and
[53:05] all that you've been through all that
[53:07] you you're going through I said God's
[53:09] got a purpose in it we might not see uh
[53:13] right now what God is doing but later on
[53:15] I believe one day we'll be able to look
[53:17] back come on and see a purpose and what
[53:20] you know I was I was telling my mom I
[53:22] said everybody on the job might be saved

[1:02:19] pressure comes what you gonna do when
[1:02:20] the pressure come
[1:02:21] come on you ain't gonna just all of a
[1:02:23] sudden learn how to pray all of a sudden
[1:02:25] learn how to give it over to God but God
[1:02:28] is training you God is bringing you
[1:02:30] through these little tests these little
[1:02:32] trials to build you up for things build
[1:02:35] you up those little wins are building
[1:02:37] you up for the stronger winds but all
[1:02:39] you're doing it ain't that you're
[1:02:40] learning tactics but all you're doing
[1:02:43] and is learning how to lean and depend
[1:02:45] on Jesus all you're doing is learning
[1:02:48] how to give it over to God because you
[1:02:50] brought me through this Lord I know I
[1:02:52] couldn't handle that you handled it now
[1:02:54] God I'm looking for you to handle this
[1:02:56] all you're doing is learning how to let
[1:02:59] how to let go even more and let God have
[1:03:01] his way
[1:03:02] because God wants to handle it you know
[1:03:04] I was on my knees in prayer things was
[1:03:07] coming
[1:03:08] all around I said Lord you know I need
[1:03:11] wisdom
[1:03:12] but you know I thought about Joshua I
[1:03:15] said when they went in God promised them
[1:03:17] the whole land is yours
[1:03:20] I give it to you come on he said the
[1:03:22] place every place to shoulder your foot
[1:03:24] touch try to tread upon he said I'm
[1:03:26] gonna give it to you ain't gonna be a
[1:03:28] man to be able to stand before you come
[1:03:30] on long as you keep the word now he says
[1:03:33] that as I was with Moses so I'll be with
[1:03:35] thee
[1:03:36] that's what we're beginning to tell them
[1:03:38] God ain't gone come on God didn't leave
[1:03:40] God is still here
[1:03:43] and just as he was with Moses or with
[1:03:45] the prophet so he's with us but I began
[1:03:48] to say you know looking at Joshua if he
[1:03:51] would have looked at maybe had the maps
[1:03:54] out oh we got the malachites here the
[1:03:56] amorites here look at the whole battle
[1:03:59] and begin counting up how many people he
[1:04:01] got the more he looked at the whole
[1:04:03] thing the whole picture then it would
[1:04:06] have looked pretty Grim right maybe it
[1:04:10] would have caused him to look at a
[1:04:12] certain way but I don't believe he
[1:04:13] looked at it like that but I believe he
[1:04:15] looked at it one mountain at a Time come
[1:04:18] on one city at the time one fight at the
[1:04:21] time one battle at the time come on we
[1:04:23] we know that God has given us the land
[1:04:26] right and we're taking it one he said to
[1:04:29] place every place to show your foot
[1:04:31] touch I'm gonna give it to you we taking
[1:04:33] it one foot step at a time so I began to
[1:04:36] look at all the situation trials I said
[1:04:38] we're going to take it one bit one
[1:04:40] mountain at a time we're gonna look at
[1:04:42] it one victory at a time and every
[1:04:44] victory that God give it give us we
[1:04:46] ain't giving up no ground now come on
[1:04:48] bro we're gonna take it and we're gonna
[1:04:49] move on to the next objective because
[1:04:51] God has given us the land already
[1:04:54] we ain't gonna let it be Cloud we ain't
[1:04:56] gonna we ain't gonna be swamped because
[1:04:58] as my sister Rachel was telling me she
[1:05:00] says uh Jermaine there's too many Devils
[1:05:02] to fight at one time we can't fight them
[1:05:04] all at once I said no we can't I said
[1:05:07] we're gonna get them one at the time
[1:05:08] so after she had the baby the Lord
[1:05:11] blessed her to have the baby the other
[1:05:13] day I said okay we got one we got one
[1:05:15] Victory we're moving on to the next one
[1:05:17] so we begin to say hey we go we're gonna
[1:05:19] look at that I said now Rachel you don't
[1:05:21] got the baby out the way now you can
[1:05:22] help me fight now
[1:05:24] I said now she said okay I said you can
[1:05:26] help me I said cause I got almost got
[1:05:28] bogged down I said but you can help me
[1:05:29] now she said okay I said I know you
[1:05:31] can't do much in strength I said but you
[1:05:33] don't got the baby out of the way you
[1:05:34] can help me fight now but what it is
[1:05:36] taking the Lord was showing me in prayer
[1:05:39] we we taking it one victory at a time
[1:05:41] one mountain at the time nevertheless
[1:05:43] God has given us the victory but we
[1:05:45] ain't worried about how many of them out
[1:05:46] there because we know what the promise
[1:05:49] of God says and what we're going to do
[1:05:51] is take it foot step by footstep city by
[1:05:53] City Mountain by Mountain Victory by
[1:05:55] victory until the battle is over with
[1:05:57] Hallelujah say Ernest or how are you
[1:06:00] gonna wonder how did you get through
[1:06:01] come on by the blood of the lamb and the
[1:06:04] word of my testimony I took it one step
[1:06:06] at a time I took it one victory at a
[1:06:08] time one mountain at a time until God
[1:06:10] gave us the whole land Hallelujah and I
[1:06:13] thank God for that tonight even our
[1:06:15] Christian Journey what are we doing one
[1:06:17] mountain at the time one victory at the
[1:06:20] time one trial at the time come on
[1:06:21] things coming but we know that God is
[1:06:23] always already given it to us
[1:06:26] we're just gonna fight come on
[1:06:29] Hallelujah
[1:06:30] I thank God for that tonight you know I
[1:06:33] says that God is so good to us you know
[1:06:36] the only you know he shows us that he's
[1:06:38] the same yesterday today and forever

[1:07:03] God you got to thank God for everything
[1:07:05] don't you know things can turn
[1:07:08] so easy but you got to learn how to
[1:07:11] thank God I had him sing that song
[1:07:13] Sunday uh praise is what I do when I
[1:07:18] want to be close to you I like that

[1:07:39] and what he gonna do now you want to
[1:07:41] work on everybody else I said but you
[1:07:43] shouldn't let the devil do that no

[1:08:27] stole your praise I said I told him I
[1:08:29] said but you know what he ain't gonna
[1:08:31] steal mine
[1:08:33] because I've appraised them through the
[1:08:36] good and the bad whether I'm happy or
[1:08:39] whether I'm sad come on whether I got
[1:08:41] money in the bank or not I can't still
[1:08:43] can't lose my praise
[1:08:45] come on these things shouldn't Define
[1:08:48] you Jesus said that you know he he says
[1:08:51] that that the carnal things and all that
[1:08:53] just paraphrasing it he said that ain't
[1:08:55] what that that shouldn't be what makes a
[1:08:57] man
[1:08:58] come on what makes you
[1:09:00] that shouldn't be what what you governed
[1:09:02] by come on
[1:09:04] but in all things you should be content
[1:09:07] come on that God saved you that he
[1:09:10] brought you out a world of Darkness Into
[1:09:13] The Marvelous Light that he showed you
[1:09:15] that you belong to him and that he wrote
[1:09:18] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:09:19] before the foundation of the world and
[1:09:22] once you know that that God has
[1:09:24] predestinated you it ain't no trial it
[1:09:26] ain't no situation it ain't no test it
[1:09:29] ain't nothing that's going to be able to
[1:09:30] stop you or to move you from the love of
[1:09:34] God
[1:09:35] come on no powers or nothing can't shake
[1:09:39] you
[1:09:40] because God knew you and he already
[1:09:43] predestinated you to make it through it
[1:09:45] y'all believe that I said but God is so
[1:09:47] good come on
[1:09:49] I didn't want to be long but I said fine
[1:09:51] and solace in troubled times come on
[1:09:54] what is your go-to tonight
[1:09:56] what is your go-to
[1:09:58] come on I know one thing my go-to is the
[1:10:01] word
[1:10:02] the word I'll lift you up
[1:10:05] it'll lift you up by the Dark Places the
[1:10:08] world will lift you up amen
[1:10:12] [Applause]
[1:10:18] thank God for the word tonight
[1:10:21] amen
[1:10:23] I was just listening to my brother
[1:10:26] Ernest and you know I was thanking the
[1:10:28] lord for
[1:10:30] he
[1:10:31] the prayer changed things amen
[1:10:34] when you get desperate now
[1:10:37] I wrote down desperation
[1:10:40] and thinking about what the prophet said
[1:10:42] we got the prayers of beer and we got to
[1:10:44] be desperate amen
[1:10:46] I remember first looking into what the
[1:10:49] prophet was saying and message of the
[1:10:52] hour and he says
[1:10:54] the desperation was something I really
[1:10:57] you know
[1:10:59] really enjoyed that message
[1:11:01] and uh perseverance
[1:11:04] and it's just messages like that did
[1:11:07] really
[1:11:08] you know make you stronger and just
[1:11:11] really
[1:11:12] you know just listening and getting
[1:11:14] courage and getting strength I want to
[1:11:17] say one thing you know to sitting there
[1:11:19] listening to the word and
[1:11:21] you know sometimes we see our loved ones
[1:11:23] and they look like they're backing up
[1:11:25] and they're getting further away from
[1:11:27] God and look like they're backsliding
[1:11:28] all and you get at them about it and God
[1:11:32] just saying believe just saying to me
[1:11:35] don't don't tell them
[1:11:37] don't get at them don't fuss at them
[1:11:40] just said I'm just gonna love you back
[1:11:44] and I'm just going to pray you bye
[1:11:47] show them do you love them more
[1:11:50] because you know fussing that I'm a
[1:11:54] might make him go farther back
[1:11:57] but show them how much you love them
[1:12:00] showing how much you care about them
[1:12:03] you know when you if you can set it in
[1:12:04] church
[1:12:06] and your loved ones are not here and
[1:12:08] they could be here
[1:12:10] then how much do you love them when you
[1:12:13] love them enough to get out on your
[1:12:14] knees and make a depressed services to
[1:12:16] be crying out for them
[1:12:19] how much do you love them
[1:12:22] he said well I I love love is action
[1:12:27] and we can get out on our needs and we
[1:12:29] cry out for them
[1:12:31] if we don't you know make it depressed
[1:12:34] service get on our knees and start
[1:12:36] crying out for them that God would touch
[1:12:39] them and deliver them just as much as we
[1:12:42] you know went in fasting and praying for
[1:12:44] sister Marie and sister Grace and the
[1:12:47] different needs
[1:12:49] you you got to love
[1:12:52] enough to stand in the gap
[1:12:56] you know
[1:12:57] you know what's important to you
[1:13:01] you'll find out what's important to you
[1:13:04] that's what you'll go that extra mile of
[1:13:06] the way for
[1:13:08] and sometimes the most important thing
[1:13:10] is that your loved ones sold
[1:13:14] the way that soul don't spend eternity
[1:13:17] sometimes those things are not as
[1:13:19] important we don't go that extra mile
[1:13:21] that extra effort
[1:13:24] to make sure they're in the house of the
[1:13:26] Lord
[1:13:27] to make sure that you know they were in
[1:13:29] right standing with God that you're
[1:13:31] praying for them and you know that you
[1:13:34] want them to be there and they know that
[1:13:37] you love them enough that you want them
[1:13:39] to be there but it's going to take your
[1:13:40] prayer not to you know fussing and
[1:13:44] arguing with them it's going to take
[1:13:46] your prayer and letting them know I love
[1:13:49] you I want you to be here I want you to
[1:13:52] be in the house of the Lord I don't want
[1:13:53] you to miss church I want you to be here
[1:13:56] and I you know but you got to talk to
[1:13:58] him and tell them I want you to be here
[1:14:00] amen because I want you to make it to
[1:14:03] heaven now this is the place where you
[1:14:06] ought to find your joy this is where you
[1:14:08] find your peace in the house of the Lord
[1:14:10] this is the place you'll come here and
[1:14:12] you find Satan a safe Zone when two or
[1:14:16] three are gathered in my name God said
[1:14:18] I'll be in the best
[1:14:20] and you you got to know that you you got
[1:14:24] to know that for you
[1:14:26] and you you got to get that in your
[1:14:29] heart and Lord you meet me here amen and
[1:14:33] not only you meet me here when I go home
[1:14:35] I gotta have that same type of
[1:14:37] fellowship with the Lord I got to know
[1:14:39] that God is with me they
[1:14:42] in and day out
[1:14:43] and if you got a friend and they can't
[1:14:45] come to the house of the Lord I believe
[1:14:47] sometimes you got to give that friend up
[1:14:51] are you with me
[1:14:52] see because we can be so close to the
[1:14:55] world and and not knowing that it's
[1:14:58] having an effect on our spiritual world
[1:15:01] anything that would keep you from the
[1:15:03] house of the Lord family friends or
[1:15:05] whatever you got to check it out you got
[1:15:08] to be you need to be in the house of the
[1:15:10] Lord you need to put God first these
[1:15:12] These are the little simple things it
[1:15:15] ain't much that God asks us to do and
[1:15:17] the little that he accesses do if we do
[1:15:20] that you're going to see major things
[1:15:23] happen for you and blessings and things
[1:15:26] going to happen on your behalf the
[1:15:29] little little things amen it's a great
[1:15:32] thing with God because that's that's all
[1:15:34] we can do come to the house of Lord
[1:15:36] worship and praise him and thank him
[1:15:38] that's it
[1:15:39] hear the word
[1:15:41] I mean that's you're not asking us to do
[1:15:44] a whole lot
[1:15:45] you know but that's all of the people
[1:15:47] work hard on their job and they can't
[1:15:49] wait to the weekend or they can go to
[1:15:51] nightclub

[1:15:55] you get a drink go to the nightclub and
[1:15:58] party I mean some of them that's all
[1:16:01] they work for
[1:16:03] it you know I'm saying but you got a
[1:16:06] chance to come to the house of the Lord
[1:16:08] it's got to be that same type of
[1:16:10] attitude

[1:16:14] come to the house of Lord I'm going to
[1:16:15] join the Lord
[1:16:17] amen and when we get to the point we
[1:16:19] enjoying the Lord like that we need to
[1:16:21] be back in the nightclub

[1:16:31] and then nobody can take that away from
[1:16:34] me that Zeal and that determination away
[1:16:36] from you nobody can do that
[1:16:39] praise God when you come and you cry out
[1:16:42] to God that's power in prayer
[1:16:45] I said that on Sunday there's power in
[1:16:48] prayer
[1:16:49] and you keep on praying and see the
[1:16:52] power of God begin to manifest it not
[1:16:54] for somebody else in your life
