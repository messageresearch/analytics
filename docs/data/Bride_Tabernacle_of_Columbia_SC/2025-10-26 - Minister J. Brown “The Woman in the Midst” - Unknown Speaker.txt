Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Strong winds are blowing with an unrelenting force. &gt;&gt; People running to and fro. They don't know what's going on. Men's hearts are failing because of turmoil in the land. Church doors are closing. People just won't take a stand. But it's going to take a Yeah. to keep me from my promises. Going to take a turn me around. Want to take because my feet are solid ground. People are searching for a true and living God. There is heaven in the land. Amen. And the word seems no more void. Amen. Amen. Amen. Keep going. I'll get in a minute. Hallelujah. Amen. But it's going to take But it's going to take a long [Music] me. It's going to take a turn me around. It's going to take My feet are on solid ground. Now listen, Christians are living no different than the world. Claiming to know the Lord, but truly serving other gods. They call on him day and night, but they just can't produce the light. [Music] Anointed ones at the end time. They're rejecting the true and living. Take a strong. Yes sir. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I believe I run on to see what the end will be. Yeah. I've been settled. My mind is made up, saints. Amen. Amen. Turn with me in your adoption papers. Hallelujah. That's your Bibles, by the way. your adoption papers to the book of St. John. I want to read uh from there and then we'll turn to Psalms 106. But um it's good to be here once again &gt;&gt; to bring just this thought that the Lord has laid upon my heart and we might as well do it while we're here. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; You look nice. You look good. Just so you know, if you if you were needing to hear that I wore my best, whatever, you look pretty. So, we got that out the way, right? Amen. Amen. St. John 8, beginning in verse one. And Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives, and early in the morning, he came again unto the temple, and all the people came unto him, and he sat down and taught them. And the scribes and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, they said unto him, "Master, this woman was taken in adultery in the very act." Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. But what sayest thou? This they said, tempting him that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said unto them, "He that is without sin among you, let him cast a stone at thee, at her." And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last. And Jesus was left alone. And the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her,"Woman, where art those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?" She said, "No, man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." Let us bow our heads and our hearts unto him. Heavenly Father, I so often think of this and say it that I think of the oldtimers many years ago. They would said, they would say, "We bow our heads in the lumps of our shoulders. We look unto the dust from whence we came. And that act of bowing our head is a sign of humility, of reverence, and respect. And it truly is, Lord, a an indication of where we're going back to, Lord, if time ticks on. And we're here in this part of the country, Lord, for attending a a funeral service yesterday. And and so, Father, it it is just a reminder, Lord, unless you come until you come, Lord, we will all have that appointment with death. We'll all be rolled into a church house somewhere in a box and they'll say a few words over us and they'll carry that body out to a cemetery somewhere. But oh God, we have hope more than that. That Lord, even if we go by way of the grave, there is a promise that we shall rise. And the very word that we are hearing today that we've been hearing many of us for years, that very word is causing us now to create another life, to call another life. And that very life that we're feeding now that that we get inspiration from is the very word if we go by way of the grave. We've been told, Lord, by your word that that body will call the body from the grave. And so, Lord, there's something about this word that we want to hold on to this day. We come unto you, Father, asking you would forgive us of anything that would have been done that would cause you to turn your head or maybe look away or distance yourself from us. So, Father, we want your presence to come back near to us today. And may you fill this room with your presence. We honor you. We love you. We adore you. And we thank you for this opportunity. And it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. May have your seats. We count it an honor to be here. And to Brother Simmons with the invitation and brother Gordon, my agent and manager, making sure the meetings are put together well and get here on time and and all that. So just uh truly truly love you and and uh we just want to share just a little thought that the Lord has laid upon me. And and I preached this before, but when Brother Gordon had called me and told me that that Brother Simmons wanted me to come and speak while I was here, this is just what uh came into my heart. And and I'm this type of person that I believe that whatever the Lord has, it's it's for a specific reason. It's for a specific purpose. It's for specific individuals. and and and so I try to wherever the Lord leads and and wherever he directs, that's what I try to do. I'm I'm just a a a simple person bringing a simple message &gt;&gt; and that's all that I can do. So, if if you're here today and you're wondering uh uh what can I do or what do I need to do, I pray that this message will speak to you. But just as we open up in in our in our reading uh it's a very familiar scripture and and I sort of joke when I say that within myself or laugh within myself rather that all the scriptures should be familiar to us &gt;&gt; and we hear preachers say that a lot a very familiar scripture but I just want if if I can just have your thoughts and in your heart just for a moment and your attention to the the thought the woman in the midst very very striking very uh uh pivotal uh uh moment in the scriptures and I believe it's something that we can take away and identify with uh uh with with this event with this story. But the woman in the midst Psalms 106 1 just a little bit of a foundation and I'll go ahead and say it now. I'm closing. Okay, in closing go and get that out the way. It's 11:15 for those of you that want to know. Psalm 106:1. Praise ye the Lord. Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth forever. Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who can show forth all his praise? Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. Verse four, very striking. Remember me, O Lord, with the favor that thou beest unto thy people to visit me with thy salvation, &gt;&gt; to visit me with the the the the David is making this this cry unto the Lord. Remember me, oh God. Remember me, oh Lord, with the favor that thou beest unto thy people. Oh, visit me with thy salvation. So salvation is becoming a visitor. Salvation is coming as a guest. Salvation is knocking at every one of our doors. &gt;&gt; Every one of us. And salvation that word simply means deliverance, victory, &gt;&gt; welfare, prosperity. &gt;&gt; Now that's the prosperity gospel. I believe in &gt;&gt; that God coming as a vi bringing his presence as a visitor. And when he comes, he's bringing prosperity. He He's bringing victory. He's bringing deliverance. He's bringing salvation. [Music] &gt;&gt; And so many times, I think we put salvation in a box and we think salvation of the soul. Well, I gave my life to the Lord years ago. I was saved. &gt;&gt; But circumstances and time brings about things in our life that we need to be saved from. &gt;&gt; We get trapped in our mind and we get trapped in circumstances. We get trapped in situations that we need to be saved from. We need to be reminded there is a way out of that that you're in. &gt;&gt; Verse 5106 goes on to say that I may see the good of thy chosen. So that salvation has come as a guest and when salvation comes it will give me the ability to see the good of thy chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and not only see what God is doing for other people, but that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you come today thinking that you can't. The word of God is telling you that you sure can. &gt;&gt; That I may see. That word see, look at it. It means to look at, to inspect, to perceive, to consider, to learn about, to observe. that I may see, that I may look at the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice. That word rejoice means to be glad. &gt;&gt; So you don't have to come to church sad and all downtrodden as brother Joel for say the wsy wsy woos. &gt;&gt; You don't have to come trapped in that condition. Salvation has come today as a guest. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that I may glory with thine inheritance. That word nation means people. That word inheritance means property, portion, possession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So in other words, Psalm 106 and5 says, when I see it, then what I behold or what I'm able to look at will cause me to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then consequently my rejoicing will bring about such a change in who that I am that I too can glory that I too can shine. &gt;&gt; So as I was saying, if you think you're nothing, yes, you show is &gt;&gt; huh? I don't care what you've done. I don't care where you are. This this gospel, this word has come to set you free. &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Joel, I was set free a long time ago. I gave my life to the Lord. Well, what's been happening in your life? &gt;&gt; Why are you not shining? &gt;&gt; We should be some of the happiest people upon the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; I can't help what you chose to do. I can't help what choices that you made. &gt;&gt; That you think you have to stay there. The gospel has come to set you free. All the trappings of time, &gt;&gt; every bad decision, &gt;&gt; every wrong turn, &gt;&gt; everything will fall under the influence of this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because one of these days that great magnet is going to sweep over the earth &gt;&gt; and everything that has some magnetism ability within it that's its constitution is magnetized, it's going to be pulled up one day. &gt;&gt; So what is the devil? Just to borrow a type, what is the devil trying to do? He's trying to take out the magnetism in your life. &gt;&gt; Psalm 106 and6 goes on to say, "We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly." Verse 7, "Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt." I got to hurry. They remembered not the multitude of thy mercies, but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red Sea. Watch verse eight. Nevertheless, In all of this, they provoked him at the Red Sea. Everything that the children of Israel did, everything that I've done, everything that you've done, &gt;&gt; nevertheless, [Applause] &gt;&gt; he saved them for his name's sake. &gt;&gt; That he might make his mighty power to be known, &gt;&gt; for the sake of, on account of, because of his reputation, &gt;&gt; because of his identification, &gt;&gt; because of his fame, because of the glory of God. Why? Because the name of God was upon his people. The name of God is upon you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They have his identification. &gt;&gt; Who they are is inextricably tied up in God. &gt;&gt; You cannot get away from God. &gt;&gt; I don't care how far you go. I don't know. I don't care who your friends are now. Yes. &gt;&gt; Those friends pulling you away from the presence of God. Those friends pulling your mind and your conscience and your ability to think straight. &gt;&gt; I don't care about that. I know what the power of God can do. &gt;&gt; Because I found out the life that I'm now living is the life that I was looking for &gt;&gt; when I was out in a world of sin. &gt;&gt; Don't let this suit fool you. &gt;&gt; Huh? woman in the midst. We'll get there in a minute. &gt;&gt; Return in Jubilee. Watch what the prophet says it this way. Excuse me for a moment. &gt;&gt; Every seven years they had a great Sabbath. Every seven days they had a Sabbath. Every seven years they had a Sabbath. And seven Sabbaths was 49 years. Talking about going free. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the Jubilee year, every man that had lost his inheritance by some means &gt;&gt; lost the word of God that was once in their life. &gt;&gt; The power of God that would put them fall them under conviction. The power of God, &gt;&gt; not just in church, even at home, in the school, &gt;&gt; there was conviction in your life, &gt;&gt; but you've lost it. The prophet says by some means &gt;&gt; if he was a freeborn and a true blood Israelite, no matter who had the possession, it had to go back to him free. &gt;&gt; No matter who had the possession, who has the possession? The devil. &gt;&gt; It had to go back to him free. He didn't have to pay a thing. He didn't have to do a thing. But just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's that simple, saints, &gt;&gt; brother. It's that simple, sis. It's that simple. Just stop what you're doing &gt;&gt; and go back to the promised word of God. That is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother, you don't know what situation I'm in." As I said, I don't care about your situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm after your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have anything to bring you to. Y'all know me for years. Y'all know what I got. ain't got much. &gt;&gt; But I guarantee you this. If you want it, if you need it, it's yours. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He had a right to it. It was a God-given right. Woman in the midst. Now, the thing is, if what this woman had done was so bad, why didn't they take her to the courthouse? &gt;&gt; Why they have to bring her in church? M &gt;&gt; I know correction begins in the house of the Lord. I'm not talking about all that. These guys were after something more. &gt;&gt; They weren't about church. &gt;&gt; They weren't about sanctimonious things. They weren't about the right things so much. They were after that word Jesus the man. &gt;&gt; They were after him. &gt;&gt; They didn't care about her and probably didn't even really care about what she had done. &gt;&gt; In fact, they probably had done some of those things with this very woman. Hello. &gt;&gt; Ah, see &gt;&gt; this is this is where I like to diverse just for a moment. &gt;&gt; Y'all cute folk. &gt;&gt; It's the cute folk I like to talk to. &gt;&gt; Y'all be acting all cute like, "Well, not me. I ain't do that." You've done something &gt;&gt; because you're a creature of time. &gt;&gt; I'll let Brother Simmons deal with that. I'm just here visiting. All right. Amen. But it was an attempt to bring more shame. &gt;&gt; They had an audience and and there's something striking. Y'all know how it is. Cute folk, y'all know how did you get an audience? That'll embolden your purpose. You get a little more courage. I can do it. But these guys, these Pharisees and and and they had an audience. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But there was something there there was something that the with these with the scribes and the Pharisees. Now, the scribes, they they were guys, they knew the law. They were profound expositors of the law. Praise God. They could take that word so much they could roll that scroll up and they could stick a needle or something through that roll up scroll and they could tell you every letter, every word that that needle struck. They knew the word. They had an audience. Now, the Pharisees got these two groups, the scribes and the Pharisees. The Pharisees, they they had the traditions of the fathers, but not so much of the Torah. &gt;&gt; So, they would go on past experiences, &gt;&gt; you know, well, well, you know, my greatgrandfather was was friends with Moses &gt;&gt; or something like that &gt;&gt; or I was friends with the prophet, &gt;&gt; they say all of these things. So, so they they wouldn't so much hold on to to the word, the Bible. We'll say it that way. But they took their traditions. And the Bible says through your traditions, you've made my word uneffective. &gt;&gt; Little trinkets and all these little things and and proximity to and all these stories and hunting stories, fishing stories, all that's all great and good and wonderful. Donor I it's wonderful, but it ain't going to get you into heaven. &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees, what these guys would do, they were very crafty with their understanding and knowledge. They would bring these little minute and these little vexacious extensions to the law and the the the scribes knew the law. The Pharisees would take it and they would add a little uh conviction here and they'll try to project that conict conviction on you and think that you are trying to tell you that the only way that you're going to get in and do right is you have to do it like I do it. &gt;&gt; No, we do it like this. Does it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So though distinct in their expertise and what they did and who they were, their united ambition, their goal, their objective was an anointing to scrutinize Jesus. If you have just a little bit of God in you, there's going to be somebody to frustrate that purpose, that call of God that's in you. That little bit of God, &gt;&gt; they wanted to entrap Jesus in some way. And there was always they were always these guys were always around whenever you see the scribes and Pharisees they were always around frustrating the purpose of Jesus. &gt;&gt; They were always there listen to challenged truth. They were always there to challenge present day manifested word. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Always there. So if somebody is frustrating the God in you, don't let the devil think that it's you, it's him. &gt;&gt; Because God knows who he is. &gt;&gt; And if you're in God, you know who you are. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us even so much so that the only weapon that the devil has is to get you to disbelieve your weapon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; Blessed Jesus. Their ambition is to tear down and destroy this manifested word. And in all of that that there were that that they were doing and their intention and their purpose, there was a casualty by the wayside. &gt;&gt; They did not care about this girl. As I was saying earlier, the devil don't care about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get you wrapped up and tangled up in something that feels good because of the age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; And we get tangled up in that and we think, "Oh, this is it. This is great. So, knowing the law, they were crying for judgment upon her because of her unlawful act. &gt;&gt; So, here we find out that the earthly, listen, the earthly was blocking the way to the heavenly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's nothing more that the devil wants to do is to block your way. And quite frankly, if there's anything, your vision of Calvary should never be obstructed. &gt;&gt; There should never be anything between you and your view of Calvary. The moment anything, mama, daddy, children, job, cars, anything that would stand between you and your vision of Calvary, that has now become your God. &gt;&gt; You might as well bow down and worship mama in her high heel shoes or whatever she wear, bunions on her toes, everything else. &gt;&gt; That becomes your God. &gt;&gt; So, whatever is there in view, whatever is obstructing your view, let's knock it down today. H &gt;&gt; she was in the midst of her judgment. &gt;&gt; The church, it don't have to be judged. It's already been judged &gt;&gt; for it judged Christ and Christ stood its judgment. We were we are in him. We are free from judgment. If God judges you, then he's unjust. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's tight. &gt;&gt; Cuz why? Christ took our judgment for us. When that man hung on the cross and even quite frankly before he made it to the cross, he was beaten to the point that he was unrecognized. The flesh was on his back. He took spittle upon his face. There he was covered in spit. There he was being beaten and flogged with and and all the stripes that he took to the point that when you looked at him, if you knew him, you would have to question, is that Jesus? Is that really him? He did that. He took our judgment. He took that curse upon himself. He became something that we don't have to. That's why I would say you don't have to muddle around in the sin. You don't have to take on the identification of who the devil says that you are. Christ took our judgment and by one spirit we're baptized into that body. He that believeth on me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the judgment. St. John 5:24. He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life. &gt;&gt; You believe on Jesus, you have everlasting life. &gt;&gt; Because today, today the world would rather have religious folk would rather have their theology. &gt;&gt; They would rather have their science and all of their technology. They'd rather have the results from their Google search. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Yes, &gt;&gt; they'd rather have their Wikipedia findings and they'll come away with all this quote knowledge &gt;&gt; and it's from the tree of death. &gt;&gt; So that's what they would rather have. But you know what? I'll take Jesus. &gt;&gt; Just give me Jesus. Just give me Christ and Christ alone. That's all that I'll need because that's the one that will stand when this whole world is on fire. &gt;&gt; He took our judge for us. He took our judgment upon himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman in the midst no longer have to wear the rags of sin. We've been given royal attire. &gt;&gt; And not only have we been given that attire, we've been taught how to walk royally. &gt;&gt; We've been taught how we've been taught how to act in a royal manner. &gt;&gt; We've been given royal food to eat. &gt;&gt; So our diet is not what it used to be. Our diet won't hold us. Won't hold us like the world would hold us. The diet that we have now is eternal quality. &gt;&gt; And that diet that we're eating now is going to change our very bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So go on with your Wikipedia searches. Go on with all of your Google searches cuz the world is saying that search Google for in that I can find eternal life. No. The Bible says search the scriptures for the scriptures is what contains eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that your Bible? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He took our judgment for us and we become royal in everything that we are. Even our language changes. &gt;&gt; St. John 8:2 in our scene it says and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them &gt;&gt; in church. church. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; This should have been the one place that this girl found refuge. &gt;&gt; Church hurt. &gt;&gt; Talking to Brother Gordon about it on the way to church. Church hurt. Our young people are suffering from church hurt. The older people, you've been hurt in church before, but you've gotten a little strong and you've gotten a little more distance from it. But our kids are hurting &gt;&gt; because of things that's happened in church. because of things that other young people have said and done. Mamas, daddies, your children being prayed for. I guarantee you. I promise you. I may not know their names specifically, but individually, but your children are be that's your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Don't give up on them. I know they're knuckleheads. I know I have three, but your children are Don't give up on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're part of your promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Young lady, if if mama is you, what you think is nagging, she loves you. &gt;&gt; Son, your mama, your daddy, they love you. &gt;&gt; They want what's best for you. Their heart is for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here she was in church and the eyes weren't lovingly looking upon her. They were glaring at her in church. &gt;&gt; The words that she heard weren't celestial. She didn't feel uplifted in the spirit. The words coming upon her ears were critical. &gt;&gt; And the pronouncement of those words were killer. &gt;&gt; Get rid of her. &gt;&gt; Well, he don't need to come to church. I know what he did last night. That's not the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; This is church. This is the house of God. There's liberty here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because there is a voice that's greater than criticism. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's an allseeing eye that's greater than the ones that have glared at you before. &gt;&gt; These eyes are more penetrating &gt;&gt; which see deeper than the situation. &gt;&gt; There is a verdict greater than that of the jury. The preacher and the congregation were bringing judgment. The Pharisees and the scribes typing the the the the the church and the church body. &gt;&gt; And no doubt this was a very low day for this woman. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were getting ready to kill girl, &gt;&gt; stone her, and she knew enough about the word that what they were saying was true, but their intention behind it all was twisted. &gt;&gt; They were using the very word to bring this judgment upon this young girl. And no doubt, she was very low that day. And she was just about to give up and surrender to her fate. But watch what happens. Verse 6 in St. John 8 then they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. So Jesus stooped down. I can imagine there that day in in the temple and that there's a lot of debate surrounding about what he was writing and where and all this and and and what he was saying and some talk about how he was writing the sins of the guys that were bringing this accusation and all of these things. But but the the the thing that strikes me is here this man was all of this clamor, all of this noise in church, all of the churchity that they were trying to bring, all of the sanctimonious ways that they were trying to present themselves. But he did nothing more than just stoop down. And that that signifies when when in in this time period when a when a person would soup down that that at that time in that way they were saying that I give no regard to what is being said around me right now. &gt;&gt; I don't care a word about what is being said about me because my savior is stooping. And no doubt I'm sure that God is here today in your circumstance. And I want you to know today that Jesus once again has come and in the temple in the house of God and he's stooping by your side to let you know, sis, it's going to be okay. &gt;&gt; You don't have to listen to all the noise. You don't have to listen to all the clamor. You don't have to take on the identification of what Satan is trying to say that you are. &gt;&gt; He's been doing that since the Garden of Eden. He took Eve in her mind and he tried to project his identification on her when she already had the full word. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; But what happened is she got from behind her defense. &gt;&gt; You stay behind this word of God. Like the old song says, if mama don't go, I'll journey on. &gt;&gt; If the preacher don't go, I'm going to journey on. I'm going to continue on. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jesus stooped down. And I can just imagine Jesus looking from the crowd and then looking back at her as he's there writing whatever he was writing. Whatever the pronouncement was that he was doing, he was looking at her. He was looking at them. But he was giving no regard to the clatter. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil's telling you. &gt;&gt; You're here today in this room, in this place &gt;&gt; to let you know that God sees where you are. woman, you're in the midst of something greater than you will ever imagine. &gt;&gt; Today is the day of salvation. Harden not your hearts in that time, in that moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Brother Joel, I've heard that before. I say it all the time." Guess what? You're going to hear it again. &gt;&gt; Because it's necessary cuz sometimes we forget, Brother Ernest. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we forget where we came from. That's why we act cute sometimes. &gt;&gt; We don't have a lot of grace for the one that's going through what you went through 20 years ago, 40 years ago. Because why? You forgot. &gt;&gt; You're royal. You've been bought with a price. Stooped. It was intentional action. It was it was a specific action and it was done in order to signify disregard. So if anything more from this sermon today you have you can take away that the next time the devil comes telling you in your ear in your quiet time in your alone time you have to say devil there was a man that's in this room in this room today that I heard speaking to me and I've been made aware that Jesus is stooping for me &gt;&gt; in my situation because of my situation I don't even have to hear what you're saying &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the more that I surrender, I find out that my li load gets a little lighter. &gt;&gt; And it gets easier to understand this road. I'm traveling down. Y'all know sister Brenda. &gt;&gt; No more wavering or wandering. Now I'm standing where? On solid ground. &gt;&gt; It's not anything shaking because it's going to take a stronger wind than anything the devil going to try to blow our way. Let him huff and puff until he gets out of breath. &gt;&gt; Have the devil hyperventilating. &gt;&gt; My goodness, woman in the midst. You think your situation is bad, sis, brother. You think your situation is bad, but guess what? You you you think that that that that it's mighty low where I've been. &gt;&gt; Jesus went lower than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Imagine that. I don't care how low you are, how low you've ever been. Jesus went lower than that. Galatians 1:4 says, "Who gave himself for our sins." Watch this. That he might deliver us from this present evil world. &gt;&gt; According to the will of God and our father, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver. That word deliver means to pluck out. &gt;&gt; To pluck out, to choose out for one's own self. Select one person from many. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; H think about that just for a moment. All the other the people that going through trials and situations, God has chosen you to deliver you, to pluck you out of many. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That should give you reason and cause enough to be the happiest person on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've heard it said that if there was only one person going out of going to take the rapture in Columbia, South Carolina, guess what? y'all in trouble cuz Joel Brown is in Columbia, South Carolina today. If the rapture happens today and only one's going, sorry, brother Gordon, I love you. You're my manager and all. I love you. You ain't going. We have to have that kind of faith. We have to have that kind of purpose. We have to have that kind of walk, that belief, [Music] because after all, we've been called to a royal situation. We have to act eloquently, not cute. Don't get it twisted. Don't get it mixed up. I'm talking about being royal. &gt;&gt; There's a certain error about royalty. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; So deliver means to pluck out. To deliver that we that he might deliver us from this present evil world. That word evil means full of labors. Listen to this y'all. It'll fit everybody here. Full of labors, annoyances, hardships. H bless &gt;&gt; pressured and harassed by labors. How many's been harassed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By by time, by circumstances, by situations. Amen. It's evil. A time full of peril to Christian faith and steadfastness causing pain and trouble. &gt;&gt; That old dumb devil. &gt;&gt; He don't realize that the more pressure he brings on me, that God is bringing more deliverance to me. [Applause] Galatians 1:5 goes on to say to whom to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. Philippians 2:6, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. &gt;&gt; But made himself of no reputation. So think about this. This man that hung on the cross, that took all these stripes, that gave his very life, that went into the tomb, that rose up from that tomb victoriously, he emptied himself out, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; So, you're wondering where did that that royal thing come from? It came from eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He everything that God was, he forsook it all to come to this old sin cursed world. He forsook it all to come to you today in this service &gt;&gt; to let you know that you're in the midst of something greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He stripped himself of everything that he was. Colossians 1:12 says, "Giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light." &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:13 goes on to say, "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness?" Now watch that. the power of darkness. We've been delivered in in Galatians 1:4, delivered from this evil world. But Colossians, Paul speaks it. He says, "We've been delivered from the power of darkness." &gt;&gt; And hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. That word power means authority. &gt;&gt; The authority of darkness, the jurisdiction of darkness, the strength of darkness. Let me tell you, the devil is not anything to contend with. &gt;&gt; You better know who you are. &gt;&gt; And we've been called. We've been we've been given a purpose. We've been given a position in Jesus Christ so we don't have to back down from him. &gt;&gt; Who have delivered us from the power of darkness, the the authority of darkness. That word darkness, watch this. Metaphorically, it speaks of ignorance, respecting divine things. So th this present world that we're living in, this darkened state that the world is in, it it it it it causes us to to be ignorant to divine things. We forget what God has done for us because the trappings of time and everything that that time brings upon us. As I was saying, we we do sometimes we forget where God has brought us from. And that's because of the power of this darkness, the strength of this darkness, respecting divine things and human duties and accompanying ungodliness and immorality. So when someone loses their ability to remember the divine things, what does it bring in their lives, it brings ungodliness and immorality. &gt;&gt; They'll just forsake God and what God has done for them and and forsake what God has told them together with their consequent misery. So this darkness comes in such a way that it brings misery, discomfort. It becomes so much so the darkness becomes visible and holds sway. Colossians 1:14, in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins, who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature image, who is the image of the invisible God, not a resemblance, but the exact likeness. Amen. &gt;&gt; The very likeness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the body that carried the name of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if all that God was, he poured into this man Jesus. And all Jesus was, he poured into you, the bride, the church, the body on the earth in 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are now the body that carries God. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about that, brother Joel. If you have God, &gt;&gt; you have God. &gt;&gt; How simple is that? &gt;&gt; If I'm going to say that I'm a Christian, then guess what? I'm going to act like it. I'm going to talk like it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be like it. I'm going to do like it. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Because we have to take on that identification. If we say that we are something, &gt;&gt; because when we were out in the world, we did exactly what the devil said that we were. &gt;&gt; H the devil says dance. Okay. Devil says drink. Yep. Devil says shoot drugs in my veins. Absolutely. We did those things. Huh? &gt;&gt; Take another man's wife. Take another wife's husband. &gt;&gt; But Joel. Yes. Humanity. &gt;&gt; H. &gt;&gt; But we've been set at liberty. &gt;&gt; You say, "What? Why are you saying all these things, Brother Joel? These are things of my past." The devil's been knocking on your door lately. He's been trying to to remind you of who you were &gt;&gt; just as he did to Eve. That's what he's doing to us today. &gt;&gt; He's there trying to change your identification. &gt;&gt; Trying to get you further away from the defense of this word. &gt;&gt; And the moment that he does and there's no man around, he's able to impregnate his seed into you. And then you walking around pregnant, &gt;&gt; carrying a child, and it's not of God. &gt;&gt; And you you you you birth confusion. You you birth animosity. You birth hatred. You birth anger. You birth temper. &gt;&gt; All of these things that's not of God, saints. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; Woman in the midst. Jesus was the body that carried the name of God. And within that body of that man, Jesus Christ was tabernacled the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And God chose a body in which to encapsulate his essence, his attributes, because he emptied himself out. He emptied all of heaven to come to earth. &gt;&gt; Think about that. That wasn't some man sitting on one throne and Jesus the son sitting on the throne beside him. No, it was the same God. It was the same being. &gt;&gt; H that's why God don't have any grandchildren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has sons and daughters, &gt;&gt; children. &gt;&gt; That little Jehovah that was bottled up on the inside of this man called Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that chosen body would be the manifesting station from which his purpose would be expressed. Listen, I'm going to read that again. That chosen body would be the manifesting station from which his purpose would be expressed. There stood this little woman. She did not realize she was going to be a manifestation for the word to be expressed in her life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there she stood, no doubt, trembling in her body, ready to give into fate. Her body didn't know it was being yielded for the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; So a body has significance. Your body is important. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You think, well, I can do what I want to with it. That's why all these things that are going on in the land today that they they they they think that, well, I'm a male, but I I you know what? I feel like I might be a woman. &gt;&gt; That boy running around say, y'all, I feel like a girl. It feel like the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's it's a mind sickness. &gt;&gt; I can't think of the word I'm trying to catch. My But a body has significance. And God can only show his glory when his people stand still and looks for it. &gt;&gt; God can only do something for you until you stand still and begin to look for it. Amen. This woman, she was about to be awakened. There was something getting ready to to strike this woman's life to let her know the realities of who she really was. &gt;&gt; And the titles which life sometimes brings upon an individual, the devil will begin to whisper in individual's ears and tell them these types of things. You're nothing but a thief. You're a liar. You're a cheat. You're a doubter. You're an alcoholic. These are things that life will bring upon individuals and you will take on the cloak of self-abusement. &gt;&gt; That will become your identification. an addict, a lesbian, a homosexual, violent, a a whoreonger. Say, "Brother Joel, those are plain words." Yeah, they are. But we're living in a plain world. &gt;&gt; You can't walk down a grocery aisle anymore without something being plastered, without something being blared at you, just wide open. But we need to be made aware that this identification, these things that the devil's trying to put on us and say, "You wear that. You look good. You look good as as as as a as as a cheat. You look good in that temper. You know, you told them off. You got them told. Did you really?" And often times what God will do, he he will go way beyond our problem and he will strike something that is a part of himself. Catch this. He will strike something that's a part of himself in order to release that part of us that is in him to bring healing within us. &gt;&gt; Do you catch that? &gt;&gt; Sometimes he sees us. God, do you not see where I am? Do you not see what I'm going through right now? And it's just like God passes you by and everything is dark. You can't get a prayer through nothing. But God is on his way. He's going to strike something that's way beyond your problem. Because you remember there's an identification in you that's eternal. He can't so much bring you to where you are. He don't want you muddling around in where you is where you are. He's going way beyond who you are in your situation. And he'll strike something within eternity within himself. And it will release unto you at that time at that moment. This is the real you. &gt;&gt; This is who you really are. Amen. &gt;&gt; As I so often say that, you remember back in the day, some of you old folk, there was a thing called Bozo the clown &gt;&gt; and you would pop him and he bounced right back up. A little toy had and something on the inside of that little toy that even though you knocked it down, it would get back up. &gt;&gt; So, every believer has within them something on the inside that when you get down, you don't stay down. There's something that God put on the inside of you that causes you to get back up. I may be bloody. I may be weary. I may be weak. I may be struggling, but I'm getting back up because something on the inside of me that's greater than my situation. God went beyond my situation and he struck eternity. And eternity comes barreling back down to my situation and where I am. And I find myself back in church singing songs, &gt;&gt; cooking the food around the stove, mowing the grass with a little more pep in my step. &gt;&gt; Not wanting to get the gun and blow your brains out. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; There's something on the inside of you that's calling you today. Get back up from where you are. &gt;&gt; Woman, you're standing. Bride church, you're standing in the midst of something greater than your problem. greater than your situation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's something about seeing God that releases the ability within ourselves to see the real us. &gt;&gt; Huh? That's why we read the Bible. That's why we come to church. Because there's something in that word that keeps pulling us back to let us know this is who I really am. &gt;&gt; That's what he did for you. He stripped you of your identification. God has come and told you not today. You're not going to give into what the devil says. You're not going to buy the devil's gifts. You're not going to take that box of rattlesnakes. You're not going to sign for it. &gt;&gt; Because saints, what we have to realize, and I know you know this, the problem is just temporary. &gt;&gt; Weeping may endure for a night, but joy will come in the morning. [Music] Just hold on just a little while longer &gt;&gt; because there's something on the inside of you that will not allow you to stay down. &gt;&gt; You tossing and turning on your bed and you're weeping and nobody knows, but God sees you. Just just hold on. Just get up. Amen. But the joy, I don't know where my son is. I don't know where my child is. You keep holding on. You keep praying. [Applause] G &gt;&gt; something on the inside keeps working on the outside. Oh, what a change. Oh, what a change in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, instead of connecting me to me or to my problem, what God does, he connects me to himself, which is the real me. &gt;&gt; I think of that song, if you want to see a miracle, just look around. You can look up. You can look down and then turn around and look at me. That's the miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You to you. If God connected you, if he kept you, which is what the devil does, the devil wants you to stay muddling around in that problem, &gt;&gt; in that sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. in that abuse, in that violation, he wants you to stay there because if he can keep you connected to you, then you're going to stay where you &gt;&gt; It's not about you. It's about him. &gt;&gt; So if he comes and lets us know that we are him, he's taking us beyond our situation, &gt;&gt; going around and around. What did God tell Moses? gone around and around that that mountain time and time again. He said, "Moses, it's time to turn northward." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've gone around this mountain long enough. Woman, here you are in the midst of this situation. You've gone through this problem enough, brother. Let it go. &gt;&gt; Amen. M Jesus has come once again to stoop in your situation to stoop to you man to let you see that I'm here to take care of this problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's something as I was saying that that about seeing him that releases this ability within us to see who he really is in us. That's what he did for you. He stripped you of your identification. The problem is just temporary. Victory is already in you. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Deliverance is already in you. Healing is already in you. You just think you are a conqueror. The Bible says you've been made more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8:37 speaks of that very thing. You've been made more than a conqueror. And that life that he was thinking of you is in you now. &gt;&gt; Before the world ever began, he had a thought of you. &gt;&gt; And that little attribute is just today trying to declare itself. He say, "I I I don't know if I can go any further." It's just that little attribute. You're feeling something on the inside of you saying, "I need this that that brother's talking about." It's an attribute of eternity that's trying to declare itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Prophet tells a story about that little boy flying a kite and he that goes the man goes by and sees him the little boy out there and he's got a string in the tide and he looks up. He don't even see anything in because the kite's way beyond the clouds. And he asked the little boy, he said, "How do you know it's up there?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "Every now and again, I feel a little tug." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Every now and again, I feel something &gt;&gt; that lets me know that I can do this. &gt;&gt; The Christ in me has given me the victory. And quite frankly, the victory is already in me. Everything that you have need of for the journey is already in you. [Music] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we're afraid to step out and go a little further. But I found this to be true. That if we take a little step, we find out, you know what, my territory is broadening. &gt;&gt; But if I stay here and don't ever move, we got some pretty views. We hear some fancy sermons, some fine word, we sing some victorious songs, but that's all that we see. But step out a little further and you'll find out there's a little more. &gt;&gt; There's a little more because eventually one day time is going to blend into eternity. And if we're not moving with the cloud, if we're not moving with the fire of God, &gt;&gt; then we're going to miss it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can stay in Sodom if you want to. You can look back all that you want to, but I'm getting out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we're in a situation, all it takes is a voice greater than that of our circumstance to make us aware of these things that's going on around us. It takes a voice greater than that of the enemy. It takes a voice greater than that of the devil. &gt;&gt; Where was Eve? Why did she not Why was she not reminded? Why did something not pulsate within her to say, "I don't want to receive what you're telling me." In fact, why does she not turn and run? H because we find out that the serpent, he looked probably more handsome than Adam did. And and the prophet goes on to say that as he presented these things to her, she said, "My, wouldn't that be a thrill?" So what did he do? He tapped into her mind. And we live in an age now where everything is at our disposal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We carry hell around in our pockets. a little device and and it's so wonderful. They call it a smartphone. I call mine a smart alec phone. It knows more than I do. I ain't saying much. But this voice, saints, this voice is crying out to us today to let you know, woman, I'm here bowing. I'm stooping. I'm letting you know that this the noise that's going on in your heart, the noise that's going on in your mind, I'm here to silence that noise. St. John 14:12 says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my father." &gt;&gt; So, knowing who you are, listen, knowing who you are releases the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because eternity unites with eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When there's a deep within you calling out to something greater than you, there has to be a deep to respond. &gt;&gt; So the question now becomes to you. Are you crying out &gt;&gt; or are you okay with where you are? &gt;&gt; Woman, you're in the midst of something greater. You're here, church. You're here today listening to me. Your deliverance, your salvation has come to you as a visitor. Your your your way out is here today. You don't have to leave those church doors the way that you came in. And quite frankly, you'll either leave better or worse. You cannot be the same. &gt;&gt; Young people, you cannot be the same walking out these church doors. &gt;&gt; Amen. H and any man will never live any farther or any higher than what he believes he's a living &gt;&gt; what he believes. So what do you believe about yourself? &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about just quoting the Bible, quoting scriptures and all these things. I'm talking about what do you believe the word says about you? &gt;&gt; What is your personal understanding or revelation of who you are in the word of God? Amen. &gt;&gt; I think of that old apostle song in the word of God. I've got a hiding place. &gt;&gt; So that's where I can hide. When troubles come, I can be found hidden in the word of God. I may not understand what's going on. I may not understand everything that's happening, but I'm hidden away. Hide me away, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Till the storm passes over. So, the thing that that that's comical to me is talking about, you know, what what we believe about ourselves. We can watch one YouTube video or one real and we'll come away thinking we're the best mechanic ever. That's me, man. I'm telling you, I've become a hero in the eyes of my wife so many times. Thank you, YouTube. But we will we we we will watch one little video and we we think we're the best carpenter ever. We think we're the best cook, the best chef. &gt;&gt; All because of one thing that we watched. We're the best entrepreneur. We get inspiration. We'll become a marathon runner. Woo! Be the best ever. I'm going to train and do all of these things all because we've watched something. And what did we do? We believed what we saw. &gt;&gt; I believe I can do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we said and we read this word, well, I don't know if that's for me. I I don't know if I can really do that. I don't know if that's for my children. No, it's for you. It's for your children. It's for your household. &gt;&gt; It's for this church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; If we can do that in the natural, brothers, sisters, why can't we do it in the spiritual? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 2 plus two has always been four. &gt;&gt; That is simple math. &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. Take God at his word and says, "Yes, that's me. Come on, let's go." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you believe you have, you say, "Yes, I am." Then you believe you're a Christian. You can't show nothing that you are, but you believe you are. &gt;&gt; Listen, you believe you are. And then when you confess that you are and when you confess him and he confesses you, he's a high priest working on what? Not on your crying, not on your repenting, not on your faith, but on your confession. &gt;&gt; This word right here is dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can read it all day, all night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And look all sanctimonious and holy. Well, she reads her Bible all the time, but she ain't confessed one thing that's in this word. &gt;&gt; She walked around bound by spiritual depression. &gt;&gt; He still got a temper. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But you're reading the word of God. But you have to be confessing these things. &gt;&gt; That's That's simple math right there. &gt;&gt; But what a scene, saints. What a scene. I'm I'm I'm closing. I'm I said that early, but but I am. We'll wind it down. But but what a scene that that what we have in our opening text. And they which heard it with being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one. Verse 10. And when Jesus had lifted himself up and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, "Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?" Watch what she says now. She's she's in the midst of something greater than her. She's in the midst of something bigger than her problem. &gt;&gt; She she she she knows what she's been called in here for. She knows what she did. She knows what the Bible, the the Torah says should happen to her because of what she did. She's listening to the church folk tell her what she is and who she's who she is and what's going to happen to her. She's hearing all of these things, but then the word speaks to her. The word asks her a question. woman, where are thine accusers? I thought there was somebody. I thought there was a devil here whispering in your ear. &gt;&gt; She said, "No, man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." Go and stop missing the mark. &gt;&gt; That's what sin means, is to miss the mark. So here she has all these trappings and all these and no doubt she lived this lifestyle and had all of these abuses and violations brought against her time and time and time again. So much so she said this is how I'm going to be all my life. But when the word asked her the questions, where is that devil &gt;&gt; that's been bothering you for weeks, for months, for years? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; She says, God, I don't see a one. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't no doubt she looked around because she had already heard the clamor and probably because of the the the weightiness of it and what she was going through the the fear, she probably didn't even hear all of these guys after a certain moment cuz she was so afraid. She was about to die. But no doubt when God when Jesus asked her these words, "Woman, where are thine accusers?" She probably got a little still and began to look around. You know what that word says? I've been reading in my word and that word says that I don't have to be condemned. &gt;&gt; There are no accusers. There is no more devil woman in the midst. Everyone else was gone. She said, "No man, Lord, no devil, Lord." &gt;&gt; It was just her and Jesus. &gt;&gt; And sometimes, Brother Gordon, that's what we have to do in a service. We have to shut everything out. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Cuz maybe the kids have been acting up. Maybe you and your spouse has been arguing before church and they sitting beside you and I can't even raise my hand. Yes, you can. &gt;&gt; You have to raise your hand anyway. You're in here where you can get deliverance. [Music] where you can get victory and be able to say if they can shout acting like that, I'm going to shout too. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show that devil that I have victory. &gt;&gt; Because it was just her and Jesus shut in with God in a secret place. Is that all right? Shut in with him. No man, Lord, not only had the physical appearance and presence of her accusers been deleted, but her guilt and everything that that attached itself to her had been eradicated. &gt;&gt; All of it, huh? All of it was gone. Even her acceptance of what they had said she was was gone. Even the everything that she had accepted in the past of what the devil said that she was had been deleted. No more trace. They were gone, but they were not gone. Because you see, the devil's going to be right outside those. In fact, the devil's still here whisping in your ear now. &gt;&gt; But they were gone, but yet they were not gone. And no doubt, as I said earlier, she had prepared herself to die. She had prepared herself. Well, I might as well just give into this. this is the way I'm always going to be. My mama was, my daddy was, my uncle was, my grandmama was, all of these things. And this was some major stuff, saints, that she had done. Stuff such that she did by the law deserve to die. It wasn't like like, you know, sneaking out of out after curfew or something like that. Now, I know y'all young people had never Well, I know you old folk never done anything like that. Sneak out after curfew. Ah, sure. Okay. But it was it was greater than that. It wasn't some little small infraction because her sin was great. But saints, her forgiveness was greater &gt;&gt; than her sin. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; She could have held on to her guilt. She could have held on to that shame which would have only trapped her further in that condition because she had become no doubt a prisoner in her ma mind bound by circumstances. Nobody knows that weight that you're carrying. &gt;&gt; You've not told anybody that wound, that scar, who did what to you, who said what to you. You've been holding that for years. I'm here to let you know, sis. I'm here to let you know, brother. You can lay it all at at the feet of Christ today. You don't have to walk out of here with that anymore. &gt;&gt; A prisoner in your mind. And and you know what's interesting is maybe as she walked out of the the the the church house that day, she no doubt maybe even saw some of her accusers because they probably they couldn't no longer be in the presence of Jesus because there's something about the presence of God that that that scatters demons and and no doubt they they were just waiting outside to see what was going to happen cuz they know it's just him and her in there and they're going to see is he going to stone her? Is he going to get rid of her? What is he going to do to her because of what she did? And no doubt they were waiting and watching. And when she walked out, she no doubt saw some of the very guys that had just accused her as soon as she stepped out of those temple doors. H the devil is real. &gt;&gt; But what she attached herself to was not so much what she was seeing, but what she had said. And that was no man. born. &gt;&gt; She had identified so much with that word that she took on the very nature, the very voice, the very embodiment of that word. And as she said, "No man, Lord," that identified something in eternity that let her know that you no longer have to walk with your head down in shame because I've come and I've stooped in your presence. &gt;&gt; And the presence of God, I believe, has come this day. And he stooped once again to let you know that the clamor, the noise, all of the heightened confusion that's been on your heart, that's been raging in your mind, you no longer have to accept that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what was she doing? She was holding on to something. Listen, you're holding on to something that's going to kill you. &gt;&gt; You better let that thing go. He said, "Brother Joel, that's a mighty bold thing to say." It is a mighty bold thing to say, but the power of God is great. &gt;&gt; If I don't believe that this word can deliver, then I'll just close my Bible and never preach, never sing another victorious song again. This there's power in the blood of Jesus Christ. There's power in this word. All that we have to do is not read it only, but confess it. And when the devil comes saying, "Well, weren't you such and such and weren't you so and so? I was there when you did that. In fact, I was the one that made you do that." You can look him and go toe-to-toe with the devil and say, "No, man, devil." &gt;&gt; Nobody is going to be able to keep me down. Not even you. &gt;&gt; But her confession is what rendered her free. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? What are you confessing? Are the words that you're speaking condemning you or constraining you even more in that condition? Or are the words you speaking setting you free, &gt;&gt; giving you liberty? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm here to proclaim today that the words that you speak from now on should be those that's going to set you free. You don't have to wait for brother Simmons to come, but we don't have to wait for some preacher to come and lay hands on it. You can speak a word of truth and deliverance over yourself. Because sometimes there's nobody around to encourage you. So what do you have to do? Good job, brother Joel. &gt;&gt; Good job. You did great today in Christ Jesus. The word that's in you. &gt;&gt; Sod toe-to-toe with the devil. &gt;&gt; Call brother Simmons as a busy signal. Huh? He didn't call you back in time. My goodness. She was holding on to what was going to kill her. Genesis 3:13. And the Lord God said unto the woman, "What is this that thou hast done?" And the woman said, "The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat." So she started playing the blame game. Well, it was because if my daddy hadn't done it, if my if my mama hadn't blah blah blah, and if my brother hadn't, if my sister hadn't playing the blame game. So just as this woman in the temple that day was asked a question, Eve was also asked a very specific question. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hath no man condemned thee? &gt;&gt; So when you have truth, when truth is given to you, there is power in even few words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Eve took her question and she played the blame game. &gt;&gt; And this lady in the New Testament when she was given a question, she said no to the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; H simple a big question but a simple response because you have to realize when you have truth there is power in even few words &gt;&gt; and sometimes consequently there's power even in this right here and we all we all need to learn this one. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; What did mama say back in the day? Zip it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Zip it. Put a lock on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get ourselves in situation because of this old thing right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Scourge, put your brakes on, brother Joel. &gt;&gt; Don't want to go there. &gt;&gt; You listen. You are not defined by what you've done. &gt;&gt; Woman in the midst, &gt;&gt; you are not defined by what others say you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. God defines you. &gt;&gt; Are you an eternal creature or are you an eternal creature? That is your identification. We are just here in time and in this little hickey of time and eventually time is going to blend back up into eternity. And the only things that are of eternal quality are going to walk on streets of gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil wants nothing more than to get you to think that this is all that you're going to get. Some people even go so far as to say that this is the millennium. I say hogwash. Because they woke up this morning and their breath was stinking. &gt;&gt; They had matter in their eyes, hairs all over their head. That's not eternity. That's not the new life. &gt;&gt; That's still here in time. &gt;&gt; He defines who you are. Now don't worry about what you've done. This girl didn't. Yes, it might have been bad. What you've done might have even been embarrassing, shameful, but remember Jesus made his reputation among people who did bad things, too. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks of those things that he made his reputation among those type of people. But what I want you to do just for a moment, just take a moment and think about I'm not I'm not conjuring up anything in anything bad or evil spirits or anything, but think about something that you're holding on to right now that's bad. H it's quiet, isn't it? Some maybe some besetting sin or something that that only you do in the privacy of your room where nobody's around. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Got it. Jesus died for that. &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus hung on the cross for that. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Jesus took stripes upon his back for that. &gt;&gt; Jesus gave his very life for that. That thing that you think that you cannot get rid of. Jesus Christ died for that. &gt;&gt; There's room at the cross. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 6:11. And such were some of you were past tense. But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God. He does his best work with some of the most vilest of situations. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; He does because I know what he did for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He went and gave his life for me. If only but for one, he would have gone just for one. &gt;&gt; If that one would have been you, he would have done it. &gt;&gt; But his love stretched forth even greater that he would even come into time and set foot in a body on this cursed earth in order to redeem not only the body but the earth too. Everything about eternity is going back to eternity. taking on that identification. Let us bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we as the musicians come. We thank you for your word today. And Lord, we pray that this woman that's gathered here this day could really see what's going on around her and who she is in the midst of. And I know that there are those that are here today that think that they will always be the way that they've been. But Lord, today is a new day. &gt;&gt; Your mercies are new every day as we know. A new opportunity to see who you really are. &gt;&gt; And so when the enemy comes in like a flood, and we know that he will. We know that he has. Lord, your word tells us that a standard would be raised. &gt;&gt; And oh God, we can find ourselves hidden behind that standard. So Lord, hide me away in that. Oh Lord, let me not proclaim who I think that I am, but Lord, let me proclaim what your word says that I am. My identity is in you, Father. Lord, if there be any here today, Lord, still yet holding on to something, Lord, in their lives that they need to be freed from, may you just nudge up a little closer to them and let them know it's going to be okay. I'm here and I've stooped for you. And as I've stooped, you can stoop too when the devil comes. So Lord, let victory reign in the camp today. We love you and we thank you for all that you are. And we thank you for this service this day. bless the saints here, the leadership, the pastor and his wife and all the helps here and what everything that goes on. The the sound folk, the musicians, those that come to clap their hands, to pat their foot, to say an amen, to raise their hands in victory. We thank you for that, Father. May it ever be a lighthouse for those wandering spirits, those wandering souls. And Lord, as the neighborhoods around and individuals come, I just pray that there will be such a an illumination to go forth from the word that they will be able to understand and see as it was with the woman at the well that day. She didn't know that eternal life lay within her because of time and the trappings of time and everything, God, that she had become. But Lord, you in love had to go by that whale that day. And I'm convinced so much, Lord, sometimes what we call inconvenience is really divine intervention. And Lord, you lay upon our heart to reach out to someone and we'll say, "I don't want to call them. They're going to think that I'm meddling or think I'm being nosy." But Lord, as I say so often, the devil's not going to do something like that. That's you getting an individual to be loved to somebody that needs to be loved. That's you giving turning on the switch of that light in order that that person can be a little illuminator to someone that's in darkness. It's not just up for the ministry to do these things, but this is a body move. We're all collectively, Lord, as a body, Lord, going to be changed one day. And so Lord, until that time comes, may I be a lover of humanity. May I be an illuminator of those in darkness. May I be a lifegiver to those who think and feel as though they have no life. We're all humans here. We all have seasons of ups and downs. So Lord, may we all be in our proper position doing the things that we need. When one's up and one's down, the one that's up can pull the other that's down that's up. Father, so help us. May we not get weary in our welloing. We love you. We thank you for all that you've done for us. And it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Let us stand. [Music] I love you, Jesus. I worship and adore you. Just want to tell you that I love you more than anything. I love you, Jesus. [Music] I worship and adore you. [Music] &gt;&gt; That I love you more than anything. [Applause] I love you, Jesus. I love you, Jesus. [Music] I worship and adore you. And I want to tell you that I love you more, more than anything. Oh, I love you, Jesus. I worship and adore you. [Music] Hey, I love you, Jesus. [Music] I worship and adore you. Just want to tell you. Amen. Amen. confession. There's power in confession. There's power in confession and forgiveness. Cuz sometimes you can confess something that you've done to somebody genuinely and they may not forgive you and you're still bound by that. You think, "Well, I was sincere." But when we confess sin to God, &gt;&gt; that sin doesn't belong to you anymore. &gt;&gt; You can let it go. You can forget about it because you know that he has accepted that. Amen. Just take it to him. Let's just sing one more before we go. Let me hear C. Put C in my ear. Maybe I think where do I go? Maybe not. Where do I go when there's nobody else to turn to? And who do I turn to when nobody wants to listen? And who do I lean on? When there's no foundation stable, I go to the rock. I know God is able. I go to the rock. I go to the rock. I go to the stone that the builders rejected. I run to the mountain and the mountains stand by me. When the earth all around me is sinking sand on Christ is solid. When I need a shelter, when I need a friend, I go I go to the rock. Oh, I go to the rock. I go to the stone at the building. Stand by me. When the earth all around me is sinking sand on Christ's solid solid rock I stand. When I need a shelter, when I need a friend, I go to the rock. Go to the rock. I go I go I go to the rock. I can go to the rock. I find myself in the way in that secret place. He is my rock. He is my shelter. I go to the rock. I go to the rock. I go to the rock. The earth all around me is sinking sand. All right. Amen. Woman in the midst. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; oh Lord, we just thank you for the word that we heard. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; the little song, oh God, came in our mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; As he was talking about Jesus stooping down, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; I said he took my place this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh God, when I look at Calvary, &gt;&gt; oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for the word this morning. Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, oh God, because I know that you spoke to somebody. &gt;&gt; I know that you're calling somebody. &gt;&gt; The word don't be just come like that &gt;&gt; without a purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe this morning &gt;&gt; that God is calling somebody. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; The devil's telling you you ain't no good. &gt;&gt; Telling you you don't have no right to praise God. But he took your place. &gt;&gt; He was whipped. He was spit on. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can go free this morning and worship the living God. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Won't you come to God this morning? Somebody come this morning. &gt;&gt; Somebody make their way. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Down that lonely road to Calvary. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless your children. &gt;&gt; Don't let it pass you by. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Reach out. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Reach out right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody worship God this morning. Somebody worship God in their own way. If you want prayer, you can come this morning as our brother sings. If you want prayer, you can come this morning. Amen. Amen. God is good. Amen. [Music] I said I believe God is calling somebody this morning. The word don't just come that plain without a purpose. But God is letting somebody know the devil saying all kind of things about you that you can't make it, that you ain't no good. But Jesus died for your sins. Come on. Not the church, not a man, but Jesus died for you this morning. And all you got to do is make your way. Press your way. God, I'm coming. Hallelujah. As our brother sings this morning, [Music] Oh, [Applause] you [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat up here. [Music] Heat up here. [Music] Amen. Y'all appreciate the word this morning. I do believe with all of my heart that was a word sent from God this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To speak to somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the word can only work. &gt;&gt; It's a seed. It's got to be planted on good ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil don't want you to hear. He don't want you to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you take it and believe it, watch things begin to move. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so many mountains that the devil got in your way. Yes. &gt;&gt; But if you can only grasp just that little bit &gt;&gt; that God, you already made the way. &gt;&gt; You already done it. You need healing, God's already healed you. Need salvation. He's already saved. He's already done it. Everything that you need is in him. Come on. And the devil don't want you to confess that. But you got to walk in the power of God. Walk confessing every day. Lord is mine. Thank you. Come on. Oh Jesus. You know God will do something for you. How many believe that this morning? Come on. God is good. Amen. God is good. Don't know how to close. Amen. God is good. It's our brother Gordon. Come and sing us a song. Come and close us. Come on. Come on. Brother Gordon. Y'all feel all right this morning? God is good. Amen. Thank the Lord. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. We just do a little quick chorus. Amen. Let's just turn it over to Jesus. That's what he said this morning. Give it to him. Amen. Turn it over to Jesus. And we just missed. Turn it over to Jesus. Turn it over to Jesus and you will smile rest of the day. Turn it over to Jesus. Turn it over to Jesus. The rest of the day [Music] [Music]
