[23:11] everywhere in the precious name of Jesus
[23:14] Christ amen amen
[23:18] you have your Bibles you turn with us to
[23:21] the Book of Psalms 63rd chapter of
[23:28] Psalms
[23:38] Psalms one
[23:44] one through five
[23:52] here David was pulling out his heart
[24:01] you see says Oh God die wrong my god
[24:08] early will I seek thee my soul thirsts
[24:13] for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a
[24:18] dry in thirsty land where no water is to
[24:25] see that power and our glory so as I
[24:30] have seen thee in this sanctuary because
[24:35] I love kindness is better than life my
[24:38] lips shall praise thee thus will I bless
[24:43] thee while I while I live I will lift up
[24:47] my hands in thy name my soul shall be
[24:53] satisfied as with marrow and fatness and
[24:59] my mouth shall praise thee with joyful
[25:04] lips may be seated
[25:06] father we thank you for the reading of
[25:08] your word tonight when you bless it in
[25:10] Jesus name Amen amen
[25:14] tonight I want to use for a little
[25:18] thought and I had two thoughts that with
[25:23] all our heart tonight and I was kind of
[25:26] between the two and I told sister Rachel
[25:29] if don't be surprised if I was the
[25:31] switch but she said there's no problem I
[25:34] can kind of handle it as I go along but
[25:37] it just was seeming to be pressing on me
[25:41] about the things that were in our heart
[25:45] tonight and I want to just go ahead and
[25:47] share this one let me see that power
[25:52] again let me see that power again and as
[26:00] I was reading this in I believers of my
[26:03] morning love thought after my devotion
[26:07] and it just seemed to ring in cause
[26:13] something to
[26:15] utter in my heart because there as I was
[26:19] listening
[26:20] I said listening and I was reading this
[26:22] him and I just was kind of imagining
[26:26] that David had something that was really
[26:34] pressing on his heart he had an urge to
[26:40] go to for God to do something in the
[26:46] sanctuary and David didn't take it
[26:53] lightly he highly extinct had on his
[26:57] heart because he began to say Lord early
[27:01] will I seek thee even and say that my
[27:07] soul first thing you know for thee and I
[27:15] thought about this you know as each and
[27:18] every one of us can probably imagine
[27:24] when your first thing for something
[27:27] nothing else can take that first place
[27:32] and I like it because David was
[27:35] thirsting not for materialistic things
[27:39] are not looking to get rich or to get
[27:42] famous but David was thirsting for God
[27:47] and I would just think I would say Lord
[27:51] through on what we have been dealing
[27:54] with in what has been transpiring in our
[27:57] lives
[27:58] I believe it it ought to stir something
[28:02] us something in us that will begin to do
[28:08] like they begin to seek God early
[28:13] because truly now that we realize that
[28:16] we need God more than anything and we
[28:22] talking about a thirsting after God I
[28:26] thought about in a bar
[28:27] where says that we just don't want the
[28:30] form Oh God but we want a living reality
[28:34] that God is real and I was just sharing
[28:41] you know at home talking to the family a
[28:45] little bit you know that sometimes and
[28:49] we hear so much you know about God but a
[28:55] lot of times that we're just talking
[28:58] about something that used to be in the
[29:02] history are what God used to do in the
[29:06] days of the Bible and that just become
[29:09] of a more of a form of God but I'm
[29:12] talking about are now living present is
[29:17] God somebody that knows what you going
[29:22] through and and know how to supply your
[29:25] every need
[29:26] that's the kind of God I'm talking about
[29:29] David had this thirst and six it says
[29:38] that he who hunger and thirst after
[29:42] righteousness they shall be filled but
[29:47] they got to be a hunger in there they
[29:50] got to be a first and only you know
[29:53] sometimes we we don't understand what
[29:56] that hunger and thirst is really all
[29:59] about can we begin to go after
[30:03] materialistic things but those things
[30:07] can't feel that that void that that God
[30:11] gives you that you need me more than you
[30:16] need a job more than you need anything
[30:18] else what you are longing for is me but
[30:23] we feel that purse with Cornelis things
[30:27] and things of the world that never will
[30:30] be able to satisfy what the soul of
[30:33] calling for even in the natural
[30:40] even after all that you may accumulate
[30:45] all that you may have gained in this
[30:48] world nothing wrong with being
[30:52] successful nothing wrong we know that
[30:56] being blessed you know with things but
[30:59] destined will never satisfied what the
[31:02] soul need even in all of your cumulative
[31:07] you get riches off of you to get famous
[31:11] you still a find there's a void there's
[31:16] something in you that that God placed in
[31:21] you see in the book of Genesis is said
[31:25] that God he breathed into man become a
[31:29] living soul and that's so that God put
[31:34] in you is far the first after God and no
[31:41] matter what you try are to to do to do
[31:46] or make yourself satisfied you will
[31:49] never be able to do it until God coming
[31:52] there too many times we've tried over
[32:00] and over to use substitute to use money
[32:07] are to use a wife or to use a husband or
[32:11] to use something to get satisfaction and
[32:18] you realize that those things only last
[32:21] for a few days then in you realized
[32:26] something that you don't know what to do
[32:30] with yourself and you try so many things
[32:34] like so many people do there try alcohol
[32:38] I did try drugs but the more they drink
[32:42] or the more to use it still calls for
[32:45] more they never can reach that palace
[32:51] there that they say oh I'm
[32:53] good now then they begin to go from one
[32:58] type of drug to the next until they
[33:02] almost OD but the really thing that's
[33:07] what--that's law as you long in the fall
[33:09] is God and that's why God when he
[33:15] created you he created you the thirst
[33:20] after him the bottle say when there's a
[33:24] deep calling to the deep that got to be
[33:28] a deep to respond you have to realize
[33:32] that nothing on this earth or beneath
[33:36] the earth can ever satisfy this person
[33:40] that God put in you and I realize this
[33:45] in my personal life and all the things
[33:49] that I've tried and all the things that
[33:51] I've been looking to gain until God
[33:58] began to work on me and I realized that
[34:02] I didn't even know myself what I was
[34:05] looking for and maybe tonight you might
[34:08] be in that place you might be in the
[34:12] corner you might be in this a desert
[34:16] place in your life and you didn't ran
[34:19] out you don't know where that's the even
[34:22] tried debris to fill that void but I
[34:26] want to tell you tonight come to Jesus
[34:32] my riches won't do it being a
[34:38] professional athlete won't do it being a
[34:43] great man on the earth our great woman
[34:46] on the earth won't do it but when you
[34:50] give your life to Jesus oh he's all that
[34:56] I need everything else I've tried is all
[35:01] his vanity
[35:04] it's only temporal so many times and we
[35:10] see it and we try the pleading to beg
[35:14] but David here wanted to see God in the
[35:20] sanctuary now not so much a building
[35:26] that David was talking but it because so
[35:30] many times we always think that as long
[35:34] as God is in the building we'll real
[35:37] secure but the real sanctuary that God
[35:42] wants to come into is your personal life
[35:49] my pet scripture that I loved in the
[35:54] book of Romans could just say so much
[36:04] running 12:1 Paul said it like this I
[36:14] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[36:18] mercies of God that you present your
[36:22] bodies
[36:23] see that's the sanctuary that's where
[36:28] God walks to the whale and presential
[36:36] bodies a living sacrifice holy
[36:40] acceptable unto God which is your
[36:46] reasonable service and next I said and
[36:51] be not conformed to this world see other
[36:58] work don't get into the trend of what
[37:01] the world is doing because you are
[37:04] presenting your body to God and as a
[37:07] living sacrifice holy see you can't do
[37:12] anything with your body because it
[37:15] doesn't belong to you
[37:17] God made that body so he can the well in
[37:22] it God wants your life to be a living
[37:26] testimony to the people around you but
[37:30] so many times we get conformed to the
[37:34] things of the world there was a little
[37:39] something in one of my little footnotes
[37:42] it says he about that conformed it said
[37:46] they are two resists being poured into
[37:52] the mode of their present thinking value
[37:59] system and conduct and the conduct of
[38:04] this world in other words God want to
[38:08] completely transform your mind in other
[38:15] words he want to let you know that you
[38:18] are not of this world are you in it but
[38:23] you are in another world you in heavenly
[38:27] places you've been bought with a price
[38:31] and you are not your own you can't do
[38:36] what you want to do because you are not
[38:40] in control of your life anymore when
[38:43] Jesus come in he's the captain he's the
[38:48] one that leads you not you lead God
[38:53] but David wanted to see the power of God
[38:57] oh my I was thinking you know about
[39:02] church and I like to use this a lot
[39:06] because and not meaning no harm but we
[39:11] have become so terrified and we have
[39:15] become so programmed to do how the
[39:20] church want to do things and to how our
[39:25] wanna do things and we forget about the
[39:28] leadership of the Holy Ghost what is the
[39:32] whole girls wanna read you to do
[39:34] something outside of your church
[39:36] affiliation what are you gonna do the NC
[39:40] C because man has has begin to try to
[39:45] take the place of the Holy Ghost
[39:49] but God our system is not for man but is
[39:54] for the leadership or the holy ghosts
[39:57] who lead the church though God uses man
[40:02] by his Spirit but that man in our
[40:06] relying on his own ability he's looking
[40:09] for the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[40:11] that's what the church is missing the
[40:16] thing of the week in what's the matter
[40:20] with Jesus and he brought a real well
[40:24] but I said and one thing that I heard
[40:26] they don't mind him being a Savior but
[40:30] they don't want him to be the ruler see
[40:33] they don't mind him being the good in
[40:35] order doing all the good things you know
[40:37] because God is good god bless see you
[40:40] got to keep you guard all this all but
[40:43] they don't want God to rule and God
[40:44] beginning tell you don't do this and God
[40:49] began to tell you don't do that and we
[40:52] don't want to listen to that but long as
[40:54] he just blessing me know he giving me
[40:57] all the good things and then I know God
[41:01] is good but let me tell you something
[41:04] even let the bad come he let the trials
[41:09] and the test of life come see when that
[41:12] come can you still say God is good
[41:15] anyhow when their income God don't
[41:19] change God send the rain God send the
[41:23] sunshine God send the storm God does it
[41:28] but he's still good you Nina Valley he's
[41:35] still real
[41:36] David must have known that something had
[41:43] left the site so very and I believe with
[41:49] all of our heart that something had left
[41:54] the church something had came in and it
[42:00] began to make the people cool they're
[42:05] beginning to get lukewarm the love of
[42:10] God begin to fade away because of so
[42:14] much other things that had come in and
[42:17] then move the Spirit of God out
[42:21] now you notice is that you have a free
[42:26] will you can resist it or you can accept
[42:32] it you are free moral agent and God put
[42:37] us on that wing
[42:38] and God lets you choose what is more
[42:43] important to you what do you value more
[42:47] than your soul does your job mean more
[42:51] than God to you be your wife do your
[42:55] children to your church means more than
[42:57] God to you see see God Wolf's first
[43:01] place not second but I wanna say seek ye
[43:07] first not suck and not third not food
[43:13] but first all we can follow the
[43:17] principle of seeking God first
[43:20] everything else of only place but we
[43:24] seek other things outside of what God
[43:28] said and then we wonder why are we in
[43:31] his shape we're in Shiga got a way of
[43:36] doing things and we got to follow the
[43:39] pattern one of the things you know that
[43:46] I realized that David
[43:49] so I like that I realize that God don't
[43:55] put a thirstiness will perish but so
[44:01] many times we we try to quit that thirst
[44:05] how laughter earlier with materialistic
[44:09] things in the bottle say that you know
[44:11] the care of this world with chalk the
[44:13] very life of thought out of you
[44:15] the more you gain the more you get the
[44:20] more you can see you can get but how
[44:24] much is enough in all you're getting
[44:29] where is guarding it in all of your
[44:35] achieve nothing wrong with having goals
[44:38] nothing wrong with having things in life
[44:41] but be sure God is at the top of the
[44:44] lists copy if he is at the top of the
[44:49] list everything else will be alright
[44:52] what has happened even our own country
[44:57] we are let ambitions we've let careers
[45:05] we'll let our own achievements take the
[45:11] very place of God oh yeah we still go to
[45:15] church and we're still saying we still
[45:18] preaching we still do all the things
[45:21] that are christen ought to do but it has
[45:25] to be more than that I believe it I
[45:30] believe it now is that we have done that
[45:33] long enough it must come to a place like
[45:38] David that their Lord
[45:41] I'm thirsting for you he had no other
[45:47] desire you know just the know guard and
[45:52] then no not just know him but know him
[45:55] in a personalized way I believe with all
[46:00] of my heart
[46:01] I thought about you know as the Bible
[46:05] said here in the book of Acts let me see
[46:10] that power Lord come on God has a power
[46:19] X 1 in 8 but ye shall receive power
[46:32] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[46:36] you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[46:40] both in Jerusalem in all Judea and
[46:43] Samaria and to the uttermost part of the
[46:46] earth see there is a power authority
[46:53] because God got the power but he gave us
[46:56] authority to use it so there is a fara T
[47:02] you know after you have been born again
[47:05] that God transformed to you and when
[47:11] that powered authorities come he said
[47:14] now you ought to be witnesses see God
[47:19] needs some real witnesses I mean our
[47:23] life once you have been born again and
[47:26] and your life has begin to transform me
[47:30] into the very image of God
[47:33] could you his son and you his daughter
[47:38] and if you his son and his daughter
[47:41] because we have his spirit then the very
[47:44] works he did you gonna do being a son in
[47:51] a daughter
[47:52] you know of God because it makes you
[47:56] beneficiaries of all that God has I mean
[48:02] all of the promises that that God made
[48:05] in the Bible he wants to give that to
[48:08] you that where you are not without any
[48:12] hope but you got
[48:14] venomous you got power
[48:17] you got a thority to use the word you
[48:25] know my family the other night I said
[48:27] there's new use a guard given us anymore
[48:31] and we won't use what we got giving us a
[48:37] lot but don't worry about you use what
[48:41] you got if it's just a little bit use
[48:45] that the problem sometimes we want more
[48:50] but we haven't yet he used what little
[48:52] we got I would say that we must start
[48:57] exercising our faith we must started
[49:02] using what he's giving us all what's the
[49:05] use having it a billion dollars in their
[49:11] bank and they're so well I don't have no
[49:13] money
[49:14] and I'm gonna sit and write they in
[49:16] their name and all they just won't go to
[49:19] the bank to get none of it but it
[49:21] belongs from what good is it then seeing
[49:26] God is looking you know at his people
[49:30] God in his hour has transferred a power
[49:34] and authority to the church and so many
[49:39] times we like to use their little
[49:41] quotation of Scripture that God was he
[49:45] poured it into Christ and all that
[49:47] Christ had he gave it to the church but
[49:50] I'll be using it time and now is there
[49:58] gonna be some people that's gonna really
[50:02] catch a revelation you know Oh what God
[50:07] wants done with his word and they're
[50:11] going about doing the father's business
[50:14] why because they understand that they
[50:18] have something I like another thing here
[50:23] you know also in the book of Acts
[50:26] the third chapter you know in reading in
[50:32] the book of Acts we saw how God started
[50:39] with the first church in Pinnacle's it
[50:47] was the first church that wasn't
[50:49] organized by man but it was something
[50:53] God told them in the New Testament
[50:56] they're going to Jerusalem until you be
[50:59] endued with power from on high
[51:02] see before God knew that before they
[51:06] could really be or his witnesses they
[51:09] must first have an experience
[51:12] see you can't witness something you have
[51:15] an experience you can tell somebody what
[51:18] somebody else did and what somebody else
[51:21] said or what you read in the Bible but
[51:23] you haven't experienced it so God first
[51:27] you get an experience and then once you
[51:31] have an experience then you can be a
[51:33] witness why because the people will see
[51:37] that your life is testifying exactly
[51:42] what I spoke Sita you become the living
[51:46] reality of what the Bible is speaking
[51:49] about otherwise you just go in the
[51:53] church you're going through the forms of
[52:00] religion but without alive and
[52:04] experience that's why I'm so glad that
[52:07] God gives each and every one of us a
[52:11] personalized experience I can't rely on
[52:15] y'all you can't rely on mine but God
[52:18] knows how to visit each and every one of
[52:21] us I believe that's one of the greatest
[52:24] things that the church is missing in
[52:27] this hour is their personal experience
[52:31] with God
[52:35] and reason wants to say that because if
[52:38] you look at our lives you know Baba said
[52:42] you know the tree by the what about a
[52:45] fruit sit there
[52:47] come on Bill Sayle life that we are
[52:51] talking about as a as a christen if
[52:54] you've been truly born of his spirit
[52:58] then you should be like your daddy
[53:02] mmm because you can look at the DNA it
[53:07] meant that you have the same blood and
[53:09] so and it's the bloodline of Jesus in
[53:12] you then a very life I'll be there so
[53:17] many people are making the claims but
[53:23] they have no fruits x3 we're coming to a
[53:32] close let me see that power of gain Lord
[53:38] I believe you and I know for surely and
[53:47] I was thinking about this little
[53:49] epidemic and I was just telling some
[53:51] people are somewhere I've been saying
[53:53] you know there's no way that we can
[53:56] enter you know I serve God the same way
[54:00] as we used to
[54:01] I said because our life has been
[54:04] impacted by what happened some for a
[54:09] good and some for a bad but I believe as
[54:13] a Christian it should really are do
[54:16] something to our spiritual life it
[54:21] should bring us to a reality that we've
[54:25] got to have the living reality of God in
[54:28] our lives going the church has to be
[54:32] different because we understand that if
[54:37] God isn't with us we're in trouble
[54:43] here in the book of Acts three
[54:47] it was a time that disciples 3 and 1 9
[54:53] Peter and John went up together into the
[54:57] temple at the hour Priya being the ninth
[55:02] hour in a certain man lame from his
[55:06] mother womb was carried home he laid
[55:08] daily at the gate of the temple which is
[55:11] called beautiful - axe arms of them and
[55:16] enter into the temple who seen Peter and
[55:19] John about to go into the template Xing
[55:22] arm and Peter fasting his eyes upon him
[55:27] with John said look on us and he gave
[55:33] heed unto them expecting to receive
[55:36] something of them then Peter said silver
[55:40] and gold have I none but such as I have
[55:45] give Rd in the name of Jesus Christ of
[55:49] Nazareth rise up and walk and he took
[55:54] him by the right hand and lifted him up
[55:57] and immediately his feet and ankle bones
[56:01] received strength see Peter doze after
[56:07] they had day they Pentecostal experience
[56:10] and they were going to prayer services
[56:14] and their lawman that that came their
[56:18] dailies he had just started but he used
[56:21] to come there often but this time here
[56:24] are he fasting at Peter and Peter dholes
[56:29] you know they had something and they
[56:33] knew that what they had or it was the
[56:36] money they could put in this man a
[56:38] little bag but they had something that
[56:41] he won't have to bank no more he were
[56:45] the power that that Peter them had
[56:49] received in the upper room and when you
[56:53] know it's something about going in your
[56:55] parole when nobody else can come there
[56:59] but those that God
[57:02] Peter them knew that they had something
[57:06] you know when you have something and you
[57:10] see somebody got a need you want to help
[57:14] them but maybe not the way they wanted
[57:18] they helped Peter them say well silver
[57:20] and gold I don't have but such as I have
[57:24] give ID you know what Peter said I'm
[57:27] gonna give you something greater than
[57:29] money something now that you can go and
[57:33] work yourself
[57:35] Oh God gonna restore you see Peter if
[57:40] you remember this Pete in a you know old
[57:42] New Testament Peter was a man that had a
[57:46] lot of problems and and God told now
[57:49] Peter after you converted then you can
[57:52] screw so you sing a new Peter has to be
[57:59] it has to be a new Jeremiah our new
[58:04] brother Ernest C because that from my
[58:07] life we had was corruptible but see when
[58:11] that new life the Bible said in all
[58:15] things and then begin to be new you are
[58:21] new creation see you are no more the
[58:25] same why because something happened what
[58:30] happened a new life came in and when the
[58:34] new life came in the oil I've got to go
[58:40] I pray tonight that something was said
[58:43] it man that we can really get down to
[58:47] business and get the prayer and say Lord
[58:50] let me see that power in my sanctuary
[58:54] god bless you amen
[59:06] thank God for the power of God brother
[59:10] and sister we don't have the power the
[59:13] Bible said
[59:14] have not the Spirit of God he's none of
[59:16] his sous vided grace of God we got to
[59:19] have the Spirit of God he meant because
[59:22] that's what makes you an are sons and
[59:24] daughters of God amen
[59:26] because God has identified you by
[59:29] sending his power into your life and his
[59:32] Spirit is your DNA it's a it's your
[59:35] representation they meant that you have
[59:37] been accepted by God amen and God has
[59:40] accepted you amen in its kingdom amen so
[59:44] God has identified that you are my sons
[59:47] and daughters until you get the Spirit
[59:49] of God in you they meant that devil will
[59:51] amen
[59:52] do everything he can do to make you his
[59:55] servant his slave but amen you're not in
[1:00:00] slavery anymore in bondage anymore
[1:00:02] because any man be in Christ he's a new
[1:00:05] creature he's a new creation old things
[1:00:08] are passed away all things become new
[1:00:11] God wants to make him you God wants to
[1:00:14] make your whole God wants to give you a
[1:00:17] parity in power
[1:00:19] amen but you got to want it they meant
[1:00:23] God not gonna force himself on you
[1:00:26] Amen he said whosoever will let him come
[1:00:28] take up the water of life freely and he
[1:00:32] meant God wants you to have this power
[1:00:35] even God wants you to have his own
[1:00:37] character amen and God will it be
[1:00:41] identified in your life by his own
[1:00:43] characteristics amen so God wants to
[1:00:46] give you our get efficacious as I'll
[1:00:48] rinse the Palmer said he didn't know
[1:00:51] what he was looking for but God
[1:00:52] identified he meant I know what you need
[1:00:57] and God is identified by his own
[1:01:00] characteristics God when he comes into
[1:01:04] your life he shows you they meant who
[1:01:07] you are before the foundation of the
[1:01:10] world God showed you they meant the
[1:01:13] genes of a man of his thoughts he meant
[1:01:18] God showed you that you were attribute
[1:01:21] you were in the mind of God they meant
[1:01:25] and because you were in the mind of God
[1:01:27] the Lamb of God was
[1:01:29] slaying in the mind of God before the
[1:01:32] foundation of the world and because the
[1:01:34] lamb been slain he was slain for you and
[1:01:36] I well one day Jesus came and he walked
[1:01:40] around the shows of Galilee came in the
[1:01:43] flesh died on the cross shed his blood
[1:01:48] for what for you and I they meant Jesus
[1:01:53] did it amen but he said whosoever
[1:01:55] believes in Him should not perish but
[1:01:58] have everlasting life
[1:02:00] God wants you to have eternal life in
[1:02:04] that eternal life
[1:02:05] you know I was sitting there listening
[1:02:08] to the preaching and and I thought about
[1:02:12] you know Sunday morning will you be

[1:02:27] anything anything goes just you name it
[1:02:31] claim it and do it you know it's
[1:02:34] acceptable the church has accepted
[1:02:36] anything the church had accepted the
[1:02:39] devil himself a man a preacher can get
[1:02:44] in the pulpit marry two and three times
[1:02:46] and amen ain't nothing wrong with it the
[1:02:49] church accepted hallelujah can preach

[1:02:54] got the Spirit of God the Bible say the
[1:02:57] mission must be blamed as the husband of
[1:02:59] one wife in that right see the Word of
[1:03:03] God means little to people people accept
[1:03:06] anything outside of the word he said my
[1:03:12] people are destroyed because of lack of
[1:03:13] knowledge but the word is right here
[1:03:15] plain in plain view but the people I've
[1:03:20] gone a deacon must read a hundred or one
[1:03:23] wife but we had it doesn't make a
[1:03:25] difference people just disregard
[1:03:31] anything the Bible says and just do what
[1:03:33] their won't and it's accepted amen they

[1:03:48] people out of each if you round and he
[1:03:51] destroyed them for unbelief amen

[1:04:01] Christian walk
[1:04:02] you don't want you to stop and still and
[1:04:05] build a golden calf in the wilderness

[1:04:09] care Moses are known in the mountain too
[1:04:12] long let's worship the golden calf and
[1:04:17] no doubt that the whole Israel accepted
[1:04:21] the golden calf worship after all God
