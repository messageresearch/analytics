[41:11] blessing to be gathered here amen and I
[41:15] believe the purpose is to Worship the
[41:18] Lord amen amen
[41:21] because from the Garden of
[41:25] Eden God wanted to be worshiped
[41:28] sir and today we are here just to
[41:31] worship Him
[41:33] amen
[41:35] amen so I just want to read one
[41:40] scripture just as a greeting
[41:45] amen amen
[41:49] amen uh I want to read from John chapter
[41:52] 4
[42:17] [Music]
[42:23] uh maybe let me read from verse
[42:27] [Music]
[42:34] 19 uh the woman said unto him
[42:37] sir I perceive that thou art a prophet
[42:42] yes our fathers worshiped in this
[42:45] mountain and he said that in Jerusalem
[42:49] is the place where men or to
[42:52] worship Jesus says unto her woman
[42:56] believe me
[42:58] the hour
[43:00] cometh when he shall neither in this
[43:04] mountain nor yet at
[43:06] Jerusalem worship the
[43:09] father ye worship you know not what yeah
[43:14] we know what we
[43:16] worship yeah for salvation is of the
[43:20] Jews yes
[43:22] sir but the hour cometh and now is
[43:27] when the true worshippers oh yeah shall
[43:31] worship the father in the spirit and in
[43:35] truth for the father seeketh such to
[43:39] worship Him
[43:41] am God is a spirit and they that worship
[43:46] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[43:51] truth
[43:53] amen
[43:55] amen so I believe we are here to worship
[43:59] him in the spirit and in truth
[44:02] am you know the the Bible
[44:06] says God is seeking for such
[44:10] worshippers am
[44:12] amen if he's seeking for them then it
[44:16] means they are very few come on now they
[44:20] are not
[44:21] there he's just seeking for
[44:25] them so you can't see for something
[44:27] which is
[44:30] there you seek for something which is
[44:33] not
[44:34] there but we thank God that God has
[44:37] found
[44:39] us
[44:40] amen so we have to worship God in the
[44:44] spirit and in the truth so meaning that
[44:48] there are many people who even don't
[44:51] know whom to worship yeah yeah they they
[44:55] can go to church yeah yes come on Amen
[44:59] they can worship they can sing come on
[45:02] but they don't know whom they
[45:04] worship yeah but that's what Jesus was
[45:06] telling that woman yes sir you don't
[45:09] know whom to
[45:10] worship sir amen but I want to thank God
[45:15] that there are people who have
[45:17] known whom to
[45:20] worship amen because God is a spirit and
[45:25] they that worship Him
[45:27] must it is a
[45:30] must amen not maybe but it's a must to
[45:35] worship him in the spirit and in the
[45:38] truth
[45:40] amen and you know today if you ask
[45:42] somebody whom do you worship he just
[45:44] says I worship God I worship God yes but
[45:47] with
[45:49] God they don't know the god they
[45:51] worshiping amen but the Bible says in
[45:55] the beginning there was word and the
[45:58] Word was with God and the Word was God
[46:05] Amen so we find out that we are
[46:07] worshiping the
[46:09] word is that
[46:11] right is that right so when you are
[46:15] right in the word then you know whom to
[46:18] worship am
[46:21] amen amen in the beginning there was a
[46:25] word and the word was with God and the
[46:29] Word was
[46:31] God Amen so some people say I believe in
[46:35] God I believe in God but if you give
[46:37] them the
[46:39] word they deny the word now whom do they
[46:44] worship wow so we have to come back to
[46:48] the
[46:48] word for us to know whom to worship we
[46:52] must come back to the word the word amen
[46:56] and we thank God for the reveal word in
[46:58] due
[47:00] season amen brings us to know whom to
[47:04] worship amen I believe it's in the book
[47:08] of uh First Kings I
[47:11] believe there were also
[47:13] [Music]
[47:14] worshippers
[47:16] amen but there is one who knew whom to
[47:20] worship and That Was
[47:23] Elijah amen amen yes
[47:28] and they really worshiped and they
[47:30] danced they sang They praised they did
[47:33] everything but they didn't know whom to
[47:36] worship that's
[47:38] good is that
[47:40] right then Elijah says
[47:45] now God come come come here and I show
[47:48] you whom to
[47:51] worship is that right and the Bible says
[47:55] when they sang when they praise and they
[47:58] worshiped they kicked the
[48:02] stones it took
[48:04] Elijah to gather the stones on now and
[48:09] put them together in their
[48:12] places and I believe those stones type
[48:15] the
[48:16] scriptures is that right yes sir yeah so
[48:19] he had to bring the scriptures each
[48:21] scripture to its place yes sir he
[48:25] repaired the altar
[48:29] amen then after repairing the altar he
[48:32] said now Lord I have done it according
[48:35] to
[48:37] thy according to
[48:39] thy according to Thy word amen now Let
[48:44] the Fire
[48:45] Fall
[48:47] hallelujah
[48:49] hallelujah he did it according to the
[48:52] word of the Lord and the fire fell
[48:58] amen and today when he want the fire to
[49:01] fall we must do it according to his
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:06] word
[49:07] amen hallelujah then the healing came in
[49:12] the Miracles the Wonders amen and today

[1:02:10] gone I'm so glad I'm
[1:02:13] still
[1:02:15] Yes Genesis 14 I'm Excuse Me Genesis
[1:02:19] 1:14 through 19 and God said let there
[1:02:23] be light in the firmament of the heavens
[1:02:26] to divide the day from the night and let
[1:02:30] them be for signs and for seasons and
[1:02:34] for days and years and let them be for
[1:02:38] lights in the firmament of Heaven to
[1:02:41] give light upon the Earth and it was so
[1:02:44] uhhuh and God made two great lights the
[1:02:49] greater light to Rule the Day the Lesser
[1:02:51] light to rule the night he made the
[1:02:54] stars all
[1:02:56] also and God set them in the firmament
[1:02:59] of the heaven to give light upon the
[1:03:01] earth I love that
[1:03:05] yeah and to rule over the day and over
[1:03:08] the night and to divide the light from
[1:03:11] darkness and God saw that it was
[1:03:16] good you love the
[1:03:18] Lord Genesis
[1:03:20] 126
[1:03:23] 27 and God said let us make man in our
[1:03:27] image after our likeness and let them
[1:03:30] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:03:33] and over the fowl of the air and over
[1:03:36] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[1:03:39] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:03:41] upon the Earth yeah so God created man

[1:03:48] created him male and female created he
[1:03:53] them uhuh and don't you forget it

[1:05:04] answer yeah right where was thou when I
[1:05:08] laid the foundation of the earth declare
[1:05:12] if thou H has understanding yeah who
[1:05:16] have laid the measures thereof if thou

[1:05:22] upon
[1:05:24] it where on are the foundations thereof
[1:05:29] fashioned or who laid the Cornerstone

[1:06:23] father we didn't come here for ENT
[1:06:26] amen but we came to be

[1:07:26] God is so good to us
[1:07:28] amen I don't know about you
[1:07:31] but I'm going say all that I need to
[1:07:35] say you
[1:07:37] know until you
[1:07:41] recognize that you're
[1:07:45] free you will always be bound all
[1:07:49] right by some system come on come
[1:07:54] on and I found out that in all my
[1:07:58] years in the message see we left a
[1:08:03] system but we have come to a place now
[1:08:07] in
[1:08:08] time where we see that many of the
[1:08:12] people I won't say all right right even
[1:08:15] in this message yes come on have built a
[1:08:20] system
[1:08:22] hello many people
[1:08:25] have
[1:08:27] fallen because they
[1:08:29] married to a system right yes sir
[1:08:34] instead of Christ
[1:08:38] himself one thing I know about the word
[1:08:42] of God yes it comes to identify
[1:08:48] you I read there in Genesis because many
[1:08:51] of us
[1:08:53] know that in Genesis the the the the the
[1:08:57] Earth was void and without shape yes
[1:09:00] come
[1:09:01] on and even though there were things
[1:09:03] laying beneath that voidness am there
[1:09:07] was no
[1:09:10] identification and as the Pastor said
[1:09:13] amen it took the word yes the spoken
[1:09:18] word to bring forth
[1:09:21] light to separate the darkness am amen
[1:09:25] yes sir from the
[1:09:27] light it took
[1:09:30] God to move back
[1:09:33] everything that was
[1:09:36] hindering the
[1:09:38] manifestation of the seeds that were
[1:09:41] buried y'all already hear what I'm
[1:09:46] saying we have a a a time
[1:09:50] now where God has given us the
[1:09:54] opportunity yeah to make our
[1:09:56] Christianity real all right all right
[1:10:00] understand me like the brother
[1:10:03] said many people don't know what they're
[1:10:08] worshiping is that right because God is
[1:10:12] light amen right and in a day like this
[1:10:17] day men still struggle with identity
[1:10:21] come on they don't know who they are
[1:10:25] what they are where they came from and
[1:10:29] where they going right that's right that
[1:10:32] is the god of
[1:10:34] Darkness come on come on
[1:10:37] somebody we must
[1:10:39] understand that we living it all over
[1:10:43] again uhhuh goad where the world is
[1:10:49] void the world can't give you
[1:10:52] nothing The World Is void people are
[1:10:57] void because without
[1:10:59] God you're void you're
[1:11:03] empty Hallelujah and God is the only one
[1:11:08] who can
[1:11:09] [Applause]
[1:11:12] satisfy my subject
[1:11:16] tonight is the Gathering of the
[1:11:21] [Applause]
[1:11:22] darkness we're living in a time where
[1:11:25] people are
[1:11:27] afraid
[1:11:29] fear
[1:11:31] true and if you
[1:11:33] still if you are a Christian and you
[1:11:39] afraid to
[1:11:42] die I to go through some
[1:11:44] trial something vital is missing in your
[1:11:49] life all right all right all
[1:11:53] right one thing you must
[1:11:56] understand God works by his own timing
[1:12:00] that's
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:03] Hallelujah and God is even Bound by his
[1:12:06] own
[1:12:08] word is that
[1:12:11] right for an
[1:12:14] example when Jesus
[1:12:17] died he couldn't just get up
[1:12:20] ameno he was bound by his own word yes
[1:12:24] amen amen the Bible says as Jonah was in
[1:12:29] the belly of the wh for three days and
[1:12:31] three
[1:12:33] nights he couldn't come up on the first
[1:12:37] day he couldn't come up on the second
[1:12:40] day that's good he had to come up at
[1:12:43] that appointed
[1:12:46] time that's good is that right and you
[1:12:49] got to
[1:12:50] realize the Bible says that when Jesus
[1:12:54] died
[1:12:56] the graves were
[1:12:58] open come on
[1:13:00] somebody that means there was an Avenue
[1:13:03] where those who were dead in God could
[1:13:06] come out yes sir but they could not come
[1:13:09] out come on until Jesus came
[1:13:14] out because he was the first
[1:13:18] fruit he had to be the first to come
[1:13:22] out and to manifest himself
[1:13:25] yes sir but why are you saying all these
[1:13:28] things because
[1:13:30] Christians don't know how to wait on
[1:13:35] God they don't know how to wait for God
[1:13:40] and let me say it like this nothing
[1:13:44] happens to a Christian without God
[1:13:47] knowing about
[1:13:48] [Applause]
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:52] it we are
[1:13:55] in a
[1:13:58] position we're about to
[1:14:02] experience
[1:14:03] something like Enoch
[1:14:06] experienced amen we're getting ready for
[1:14:10] the change of the
[1:14:13] body but many people think because
[1:14:17] they're
[1:14:19] religious God don't
[1:14:22] caree sir God is not looking for
[1:14:25] religion he came for his
[1:14:29] children he asked the question to job
[1:14:32] and I'm asking it to you where were
[1:14:36] you when the morning Stars
[1:14:39] sang can I ask you a question brother
[1:14:42] who is the morning Stars oh we
[1:14:47] rejoice as if we're speaking of someone
[1:14:50] else come on now but these were
[1:14:53] representations
[1:14:55] yeah in the mind of God of you and
[1:15:00] me but what were you shouting
[1:15:04] about what was the Joy
[1:15:08] about hallelujah
[1:15:11] hallelujah job had gone through so many
[1:15:14] trials oh yeah man but you know what he
[1:15:17] had God had to break him right cuz
[1:15:20] sometimes people get so
[1:15:23] religious they think they got it all in
[1:15:25] the
[1:15:26] bag I've done this I've done that I've
[1:15:29] kept
[1:15:30] all but even your
[1:15:33] sacrifices doesn't declare that you know
[1:15:36] who you sacrificing
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:39] to sir and God wanted job to
[1:15:44] see who was behind him all right God
[1:15:49] wanted job to see who was blessing
[1:15:52] him it wasn't job's ility to be rich God
[1:15:57] ordained
[1:15:59] him y'all understand what I'm trying to
[1:16:01] say what I'm saying is is that when you
[1:16:06] think that you're
[1:16:09] somebody you're
[1:16:11] nobody all
[1:16:13] right many people think that the heavens
[1:16:17] were placed in their position just to
[1:16:19] determine Four Seasons you know how
[1:16:22] people do I'm going through my winter a
[1:16:26] season you see but it was also placed
[1:16:30] there for the Times all right yes and I
[1:16:35] thought about this thing when when God
[1:16:38] created everything on the sixth day and
[1:16:41] he rested on the seventh and I'm like
[1:16:43] what is he resting
[1:16:45] for because he had already
[1:16:49] finished there was nothing left to do oh
[1:16:53] I'm getting happy now
[1:16:55] because you got to
[1:16:57] realize salvation is of the
[1:17:00] Lord and this thing was done before you
[1:17:04] got
[1:17:08] here is that all right so you say what
[1:17:13] you trying to say listen let me tell you
[1:17:15] like
[1:17:16] this uh Heaven as the Bible says and
[1:17:20] Earth declare of his glory and I thought
[1:17:23] what are they talking about what is what
[1:17:24] is psalmist saying Heaven and Earth
[1:17:26] declare his glory because amen we know
[1:17:29] that the prophet of God said
[1:17:31] this the first
[1:17:33] Bible was written in heaven
[1:17:36] right we know that these zodiac things
[1:17:40] are all screwed up
[1:17:43] now but there was a time that you could
[1:17:46] read
[1:17:47] it those who were ordained
[1:17:50] to cuz everybody couldn't do
[1:17:53] it but there was a specific Man by the
[1:17:56] name of Daniel who Al who knew what all
[1:17:59] of those things meant that's right the
[1:18:01] Bible declared he was a wisest of all
[1:18:04] men listen he it was Daniel's
[1:18:08] teachings that produced what we call the
[1:18:12] wise
[1:18:15] men Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:18:18] saying come on think about this yes out
[1:18:22] of all the wise people muh that was up
[1:18:25] Babylon uhuh these three uhuh come on
[1:18:30] was elected by
[1:18:33] God so Daniel had to be in Babylon come
[1:18:37] on yes sir in order to bring the
[1:18:41] word come on you see what I'm saying yes
[1:18:44] sir because you must
[1:18:46] realize without the word or the
[1:18:49] revelation of the word that's you are in
[1:18:53] darkness
[1:18:55] right is that right Psalms
[1:18:58] 119 105 says the word is a lamp unto my
[1:19:05] feet and a
[1:19:07] light unto my pathway oh come on
[1:19:11] somebody in that day they didn't have
[1:19:14] lights like this they had a
[1:19:18] torch that they call a lamp is that
[1:19:22] right so their light was only arm
[1:19:28] length Hallelujah they couldn't see what
[1:19:32] was in the F what was in the future the
[1:19:34] darkness that was in the future y'all
[1:19:36] know what I'm trying to say their sight
[1:19:38] and their Vision was
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:43] limited
[1:19:45] Hallelujah but we had a light to
[1:19:48] [Applause]
[1:19:50] come in our
[1:19:53] day didn't it was not
[1:19:56] limited in this light it told us where
[1:20:00] we came from and where we're
[1:20:03] going
[1:20:05] Hallelujah when you are a real
[1:20:08] Christian and you understand yes sir
[1:20:11] Hallelujah without this light you would
[1:20:15] be in
[1:20:17] darkness yes
[1:20:22] sir Hallelujah
[1:20:26] you know even job understood he couldn't
[1:20:29] do nothing with what God was doing with
[1:20:32] him no doubt in his suffering he wanted
[1:20:35] it to
[1:20:36] stop huh come on somebody none of us
[1:20:39] love to suffer on right but one thing
[1:20:42] joob
[1:20:44] concluded I'm going to
[1:20:48] wait to my change come y'all hear what
[1:20:52] I'm saying I don't know about about you
[1:20:55] but I'm raptured
[1:20:58] material hallelujah how do you know
[1:21:02] because the light has come that's right
[1:21:05] God oh Amen brother we see in the Book
[1:21:09] of Revelation Jesus Christ have Seven
[1:21:12] Stars come on in his right
[1:21:15] hand but you see those Seven
[1:21:19] Stars rep represented light amen is that
[1:21:24] right amen and each one of those lights
[1:21:27] we we we know what we're talking about
[1:21:29] here each one of those light had a time
[1:21:32] period right to show up on Earth that's
[1:21:35] right exactly right and every time a
[1:21:39] light came whether it was Luther come on
[1:21:42] whether it was Wesley come on the church
[1:21:44] was in
[1:21:46] darkness y'all hear what I'm saying see
[1:21:50] he he had to bring it this way so we'll
[1:21:52] know which way to walk come on
[1:21:55] Hallelujah we'll know the direction to
[1:21:58] go
[1:21:59] into somebody help me
[1:22:02] [Applause]
[1:22:05] here glory to God many of us don't know
[1:22:08] what darkness
[1:22:09] is because we've always had
[1:22:13] light brother but that time is coming
[1:22:17] they going to cut your lights
[1:22:19] off
[1:22:21] naturally and what are you going to do
[1:22:24] then
[1:22:27] Jo learned another thing though he slay
[1:22:32] me yet I'll trust
[1:22:34] [Applause]

[1:22:40] the hand of
[1:22:42] God y'all hear me can can I bring it

[1:22:48] in the bosom of
[1:22:51] God you are one of what we call the
[1:22:55] untouchabl but in a positive way amen
[1:23:00] God
[1:23:01] hallelujah they brought light to this
[1:23:03] Dark
[1:23:04] World
[1:23:06] light to the
[1:23:08] predestinated Sons and Daughters of God
[1:23:11] that's right everybody couldn't follow
[1:23:14] the
[1:23:15] light Hallelujah because th as though as
[1:23:20] as as as there were those who were
[1:23:23] predestinated to
[1:23:25] see there were those who were
[1:23:27] predestinated to be
[1:23:30] blind yes sir Hallelujah you understand
[1:23:33] what I'm saying if you look at the sun
[1:23:36] long
[1:23:37] enough you will go

[1:23:47] life but if you look at it in the wrong
[1:23:50] way yes sir it will blind you

[1:24:07] me it ain't coming Christians are now
[1:24:10] the
[1:24:12] enemy you ready hear what I'm
[1:24:14] saying it's
[1:24:17] Christians who Satan is after now is
[1:24:20] that the truth why we know we know yes
[1:24:25] when those demons came out of the
[1:24:28] Euphrates where did they
[1:24:31] settle in
[1:24:33] Hollywood where did they conquer the
[1:24:35] world out of

[1:25:27] only way you'll be able to conquer him
[1:25:30] in this day you must have the Holy
[1:25:34] [Applause]

[1:25:39] being a baby either I'm talking about a
[1:25:42] matured
[1:25:44] Christian is that right because Paul
[1:25:47] said I spoke like a child I acted like a
[1:25:50] child but when that which is perfect
[1:25:53] came I put away the childish
[1:25:56] things you say what's wrong with you

[1:26:31] done
[1:26:32] wrong was Jesus
[1:26:35] himself Hallelujah he was without
[1:26:39] sin but he became

[1:26:54] you and I must understand that this this
[1:26:57] this message this this gospel that we

[1:36:44] have roared who will not fear the lord
[1:36:47] God has spoken yeah and who have who can
[1:36:50] but prophesy but understand God's
[1:36:56] timing Hallelujah is that right Malachi
[1:37:00] fall couldn't come in Luther's time he
[1:37:03] couldn't come in West time he had to

[1:37:26] know but without the Lord
[1:37:29] Jesus none of us would be
[1:37:32] here right come on we say all those
[1:37:35] Apostles they were great men of God the
[1:37:37] only reason why they were great men of
[1:37:40] God because on the day of Pentecost
[1:37:43] those licks of fire Hallelujah dwelt in
[1:37:48] them the only way you ever be anything
[1:37:52] in God you got to have the Holy
[1:37:56] Ghost Hallelujah I'm not talking about

[1:38:19] Hallelujah come on somebody I don't mean
[1:38:22] you got to rejoice in time of trouble

[1:38:30] never take away your
[1:38:33] praise somebody help me when I'm going
[1:38:37] through something I've got to know what
[1:38:39] I'm looking at Hallelujah I got to know
[1:38:44] that Jesus Christ is on the scene come
[1:38:47] on somebody is that right that's what
[1:38:51] God told the prophet if you get the
[1:38:54] people to believe all things are
[1:38:58] possible Hallelujah but let me say like
[1:39:02] this how many of you really believe come

[1:39:31] not afraid of the

[1:39:36] because from the beginning sir light has
[1:39:39] always conquered Darkness Darkness has
[1:39:42] never conquered the light somebody help
