[39:00] something that doesn't have a beginning.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Eternal life never started. Amen. Never
[39:06] ended. Amen. For you to have eternal
[39:08] life, you must have been in the eternal
[39:10] one. Amen. for you to say today that you

[40:13] tonight? Hallelujah. To him we give all
[40:17] praise. To him we give all honor. It's a
[40:19] great privilege to be with you all
[40:20] tonight. I come just from over in
[40:24] Trinidad,
[40:26] a little island down in the Caribbean
[40:29] there. And uh it's a privilege to meet
[40:32] brethren of like precious faith
[40:35] &gt;&gt; uh seated around the throne of grace
[40:36] here this this afternoon. How many on
[40:39] expectation tonight?
[40:41] &gt;&gt; We didn't come to meet man but we come
[40:42] to meet with almighty God. Hallelujah.
[40:46] And we believe that tonight you know the
[40:48] where the saints of God are gathered.
[40:50] There are angels all around. There's a
[40:53] supernatural waiting to be man manifest
[40:56] tonight. If we could only believe what
[40:58] we come expecting is what we would
[41:00] receive tonight.
[41:02] So we come with our cups emptied and
[41:04] lifted up and brother we under
[41:06] expectation for God to fill it up for us
[41:08] tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. I remember
[41:10] one time in the days of Elijah when uh
[41:14] the the host of the Syrians came against
[41:16] Israel and they would make their plans
[41:19] to come and destroy the armies of
[41:21] Israel. But there was a prophet in the
[41:23] land. Hallelujah. And the prophet will
[41:27] warn the king of all the ambushes that
[41:30] the Syrians laid. We know the story.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; And the Syrian king, he got upset after
[41:37] a while. He said, "There's a traitor
[41:38] amongst us. Someone is telling
[41:42] &gt;&gt; the king of Israel where we are."
[41:45] &gt;&gt; But there was a man in this camp.
[41:47] Hallelujah. That knew the capability,
[41:50] the ability of a prophet.
[41:53] Hallelujah.
[41:55] And he said, "No, there's no traitor
[41:57] amongst us, but there is a prophet
[41:59] amongst them."
[42:01] &gt;&gt; That when the things you speak in your
[42:02] bed chamber, he hears it. Hallelujah.
[42:06] Glory. And we thank God for sending us a
[42:08] prophet in this hour, brother, that has
[42:10] sent us a message that we can know the
[42:13] things that were in the back part of
[42:14] God's mind as we thank God for our
[42:17] brother that came and showed us,
[42:18] brother, we came from somewhere and we
[42:20] are going back to that place.
[42:22] Hallelujah. Glory be to God in the
[42:24] highest.
[42:27] And they came against the the host of
[42:29] the Syrian came to find Elijah. And the
[42:33] Elijah had a servant with him. And when
[42:35] he realized what was going on, he said,
[42:38] "Master, look at the Syrian host is
[42:40] coming." He said, "Lord, open the boy
[42:43] eyes."
[42:45] And when his eyes were opened, brother,
[42:48] he saw the whole host of the mountain,
[42:50] chariots of fire all around. Hallelujah.
[42:53] He said, "Master, Alex, there is more
[42:56] with us than be with them. And tonight,
[43:00] there is more supernatural. If God could
[43:02] only open our eyes to receive and
[43:04] believe, brother, we wouldn't leave here
[43:06] the same way that we came in tonight."
[43:08] Hallelujah. So may that supernatural
[43:10] influence our lives tonight, brother.
[43:13] Influence these meetings, brother. When
[43:15] we leave here, our lives could be
[43:16] changed and we'll never be the same
[43:18] again by God's grace. God bless you. We
[43:20] love you all. Shalom,
[43:27] brother Jimmy Mikash from Zambia,
[43:32] Africa.
[43:34] Hallelujah.
[43:36] God bless you so much.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; It's good that we're back again. Amen.
[43:41] Um, brother Jimmy and Kasha from Zambia,
[43:43] Lusaka. Um, for those of you who may not
[43:47] know where Zambia is, South Africa down
[43:49] there, then up is Zimbabwe, then it is
[43:53] Zambia, then above us it's Congo. So,
[43:56] we're down there. Amen. We want I want
[43:59] to appreciate the Lord for the
[44:01] invitation to to come over here. I
[44:05] believe uh I was here just a few months
[44:07] ago and we had a good time together.
[44:10] Brother Henry told me that there's going
[44:12] to be a 10 meetings. I said I I would I
[44:14] I'd really love to attend. Amen. So I
[44:17] called him. I was just checking the
[44:20] dates. I was like when are the meetings
[44:22] I may come then he told me you can't say
[44:24] that you you are part of the preachers.
[44:27] Uh you told me you'd been in the states
[44:30] this period. So I've put you among the
[44:32] speakers. You know my wife was trying to
[44:34] push that we we maybe come in September
[44:37] and then then I told her you see you see
[44:40] I told you I had to go in August.
[44:42] Brother Henry wants wants us to meet.
[44:44] Amen. And we are under a lot of
[44:47] expectations. Personally, I came to
[44:49] learn how to do these tent meetings so
[44:52] that I can start doing them in Africa. I
[44:55] I I maybe I'll call him over to come to
[44:58] Zambia to come and do the tent for us as
[45:00] a start if God permits. Amen. So, we are
[45:04] under a lot of expectations. Uh just a
[45:07] little word like just to follow the
[45:08] method my friends were doing. They were
[45:10] saying something. So I just want to
[45:12] remember when uh the armies of Israel
[45:16] gathered against the Philistines and
[45:18] among them there was a Goliath.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; He was insulting the armies of God and
[45:24] uh the people were afraid but uh there's
[45:26] a time that he insulted at the wrong
[45:29] time because there was David in the
[45:31] camp. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Your
[45:35] sickness may have been insulting you
[45:37] over these years, but they have in
[45:39] they're going to insult at this wrong
[45:41] time because we are in the presence of
[45:43] God. If that sickness you came over with
[45:47] it, it has insulted at the wrong time.
[45:50] Uh we are going to bring it down. Uh
[45:53] it's going to be cast out. Uh you're
[45:56] going to be free tonight. Uh just come
[45:58] under a lot of expectation. Amen. Your
[46:01] scene has insulted at the wrong time. We
[46:04] are in the presence of God. That sin,
[46:07] that sickness, that addiction is going
[46:09] to know that there is God in this
[46:12] church. That there is God in the word of
[46:14] God. Amen. Praise God. Amen. God bless
[46:17] you. We are under a lot of expectation.
[46:20] Amen. Praise God. God bless you. My my
[46:24] my my
[46:28] praise God.
[46:31] I know we got a lot of singers and
[46:33] hopefully we'll get to that later. But
[46:35] now we going to get to the word coming
[46:38] to uh Pastor Isaiah Brooks from De
[46:41] Moine, Iowa. Also from Columbia, South
[46:45] Carolina, Brother Isaiah Brooks as we
