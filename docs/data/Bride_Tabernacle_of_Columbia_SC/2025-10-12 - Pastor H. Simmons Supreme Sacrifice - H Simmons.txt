Appreciate Stacy and her family and vows and all of them that pressure your way out this morning. Amen. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things have passed away, and behold, all things become new. And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given us to given to us the ministry of reconciliation, to the wit that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespass unto them, and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us. We pray you in Christ instead. Be ye reconciled to God. For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. God bless you. Reading his word. You may be seated. We want to talk about supreme sacrifice. Supreme sacrifice. And when we talk about sacrifice this morning, we often times we associate sacrifice with an offering with an offering to offer up something. And usually we offer up something that will mean that it means something to us. And it's usually we're making a sacrifice for a cause. If you want something, sometimes you make sacrifices to get it. If you want a car, then you want to work and labor and you want to save towards that car. So in order to save towards that car, some of the things that you wanted to do, some of the things you wanted to have, you may have to avoid having those things because you're making a sacrifice to get what you want. And uh you make sacrifices if you want something, you sacrifice for what you want. Are you with me &gt;&gt; now? the sacrifices that Christ made for you and I. I want you to think about that uh as we go to first Corinthians 5. 1 Corinthians 5 sacrifices. I I want to just talk to you this morning about sacrifices. Giving up something. Are what are what are you making the sacrifices you living? The Bible says we should present our bodies as a living sacrifice. Sacrifice unto God. Okay, we should do that. But what are you sacrificing? What what are you willing to sacrifice for God? I find that what's missing in the church today and what's missing in the Christians today that they have no sense of sacrifice as a whole. Not everyone but as a whole. We come out of tradition, but we don't come to offer sacrifice. I remember uh Sister Michelle used to drive from Spartanberg and sometimes alone in the night through the week, don't miss no service and all. and being a medical doctor, she made a I said, "Boy, she's making a great sacrifice, you know, just to get in church." And then I remember over the years the carols used to come from Donald and they would be on time and they made a sacrifice to get here and they did it for years up and down the highway you know driving you know hour 15 minutes hour and a half coming to church from Dollarton. Okay. So the I look at those as you know a little bit farther than coming two miles or maybe 10 miles. those that come from Sister Michelle was coming, you know, about a 100 miles to get here on Friday and uh on Tuesdays, on Fridays and on Sunday mornings, I said, "Oh, that was a that's a sacrifice." And uh most of the people, you know, a lot of people that within 20 minutes uh they, you know, they have a difficult time. And I remember the cows, they always like to be on time. You know what I'm saying? And the most of the people come dragging in. They come in and they late 10 minutes away, 15 minutes away, 20 minutes away, but they're late. Okay. What are you willing to sacrifice? And what we do now, the Bible says God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Isn't that right? Now here in sec in second Corinthians the Bible said he made him to be sin for us. He made him to be sin for us who knew no sin. Amen. But for us he sacrificed his life. The supreme sacrifice his life for you and me. Jesus sacrificed his life for us. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He gave he was killed. He was crucified. He was killed for you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here in 1 Corinthians uh 5 it says in the seventh verse he says he said purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be made a new lump as ye are unleavened for Christ our what &gt;&gt; our passover is what &gt;&gt; sacrifice sacri sacrifice us. When we think about the Passover, we look back to Egypt and and and the children of Israel coming out of Egypt. They had to kill a lamb, put blood on the doorpost and on the lint. And he said, "When I see the blood, I will what?" &gt;&gt; So Christ is our Passover. So his blood, the blood of Jesus Christ, when I see the blood, I will pass over you. So what happens when Jesus shed his blood? He said that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. He died that he he he wants to make you righteous. Can you look at somebody like you and me and all the sins that we have committed, all the things that we've done wrong? But Christ, our sacrifice, it's a supreme sacrifice gave his life. Amen. That we could be made righteous. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He didn't want you to be a sinner anymore. Amen. But you could be righteous. Your sins could be forgiven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He died that for that your sins could be forgiven. &gt;&gt; That you don't have to you be judged. You don't He said that if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Behold, all things become new. So God is willing to make you new in Christ to take away your past and bring you into the presence and making you a new person. &gt;&gt; You can go on you can walk out of here being new. Are you satisfied and comfortable in being a sinner and you can be a saint? You can be you can have eternal life. You can have a new nature. You can h be a new individual. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the desires and the appetite of the world, the things that you've been feeding on, the things that you've been eating spiritually, you don't have to eat those things anymore because God can change, amen, your inside that you don't have the appetite. It's just like uh you know uh uh we often times talk about a a a buzzard can eat any kind of dead rotten stuff. Ain't that right? But a dove cannot do that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But God, he the sacrifice that he made. Amen. To give you a nature like a dove. The Holy Ghost is like a dove. God gives you his spirit and his love and his that's what he sacrificed that you can have that. You don't have to be mean, nasty, cursing, smoking, drinking, running around, doing all kind of filth and ungodly stuff. Amen. He comes to change that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To give you, Amen. the love of God, the Christlike nature. But if you love that, then you know, you can't love God and mammo. You can't you if you if you want to be like that. I thank God that brother said he said I'm tired of the way I'm living. He said I made up my mind today. I ain't go I don't want to go that way no more. He said I want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and I want to give my life totally to him. I'm not I'm made up. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; So it it is when you come to that place that I I I want to give my life to God. So Christ is our Passover. When I look at the the death angel was passing through the land of Egypt and he was killing all the firstborn. But if the blood was on the doorpost and on lint, he passed over you. Amen. So when we take communion and uh the bread and the wine and all is to remember that Jesus Amen died for our sins. He was crucified that we might become amen the righteousness of God in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We become holy, sinful, wretched and undone people like us. God makes us righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now in Ephesians 5 and 1, Ephesians 5 and1, it says, "Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children." Amen. Be ye followers of God as dear children and walk in what? and walk in love as Christ also has what? &gt;&gt; As Christ he loves us. If it does not if it does not sink deep down inside of us that Christ love you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's because of his love for us. He died for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he just simply why why why Lord? Why you want to love me? Why you want to die from me? Am I worthy of that? No. Are you worthy of somebody? I mean, God that didn't do no wrong. Amen. But he wants to he wants to die for the Bible said even when we were yet enemies in our mind by wicked works, Christ died for the what? &gt;&gt; Ungodly. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were ungodly people. But he made a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He God sacrificed his life for you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He he he he gave it for you and me, if it does not anchor with inside of you, you know, out of all the things we can do for one another and all the things that we want out of life. Amen. Sometimes I I I thought about a good parent, father and mother. They sacrifice for their children because they want the children to have shoes, to have clothes, to have food to eat. And they sacrifice for them. Amen. To make provision that they can have a home, a house to live in. And see, you know, sometimes the children because they think this is all in the norm and they they think everything is cool, everything is all right, they don't even take the time to understand that the reason why you have food to eat, reason why you have a place to stay is somebody is paying, they're sacrificing that you can have that. But it don't come in their mind because if the parents says, "I want you to cut the grass." They got a problem. Say, "I want you to wash the dishes. You ate the food, but I I got a problem." You know, there's always problems, you know. And now they think, "Amen. If I if I wash these dishes, even though I ate the food, that I'm doing a favor for mama." You know what I'm saying? Mama, you look at me. I'm washing these dishes and for you, you know, ate up all the food, but they washing the dishes for mama. Amen. You got a a nice house with air condition and and and heat and everything and and said, "Clean your room up." Uh and and cleaning the room up. We think we doing uh mama a favor uh uh to clean the room up. Make your bed. You know that not knowing that the bed that I'm sleeping in that somebody sacrificed that I can have a bed to lay in. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, somebody's sacrificing that you got air conditioning when it's 100° outside and you got in the heat when it's uh 32° and freezing outside. You got heat and you warm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got shoes on your feet when somebody ain't got shoes on their feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got clothes to wear when other folks, amen, don't have a one garment &gt;&gt; and they glad to have that one. &gt;&gt; But you got two, three, four, five pair of shoes and you got tennis shoes, you got walking dress shoes, you got, you know, you got all kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But somebody sacrificed that for you. Now, when it comes to God, Amen. the sacrifice he made that you can have peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can Amen. You can have love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The sacrifice that he made, he said, "Oh yes, I'm going to give you my peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to give you joy unspeakable, full of glory. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you so many wonderful things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. for your sins and for your wicked way you live. I'm going to make you righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to make you holy for all your uncleanness. I'm going to make you holy. &gt;&gt; I'm going to clean you up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sacrifice that he made &gt;&gt; that he made it possible for you to have all of these wonderful blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. all these wonderful blessings. But you know something? Some folk, Amen. You can provide all of that, a house for them, this for them. You know what they say, I'd rather be homeless. I can go home tomorrow. Young lady, she came late on the steps. She said, "I want to uh uh uh" We saw in the camera, talked to her. She says, we asked her, "What you need?" cuz we went out to the church. She says, "I need a blanket." I said, "Where you from?" She said, "Oh," she wanted a blanket to, you know, she said, you know, she was kind of homeless. She wanted a blanket. And I said, "Well, where you where you from?" She said, "I'm from South Carolina." I said, "What about?" She said, "I'm from Orangeburg." I said, "Okay." I said, "You got people in?" She said, "Uh, yeah. You know, I I wanted to, you know, see about her, take her home and see what I can do for her." But, you know, I said, "But you got that cigarette on my on these steps." She said, "Okay." And so, so we telling her what you know what we want. I felt sorry for but you know I I I I I was hoping she'll stay there. We'll try to accommodate her and try to help her. Take her home. Take take her to Orangeburg. See if she got some relatives, somebody to care about her. she didn't have nobody to care about her then I you know I don't know what I'm going to do because I you know sometimes uh but you know you look at it and you say people you know sometimes and I I noticed that when long she done walked away and gone before I could get out here to see about her she gone because I asked her who your people where you live? What's your name? You know what I'm saying? Because I I I want to know like, do I know you? Do I know your people? You know what I'm saying? So, a lot of times people are in terrible shape. But sometimes people are in the condition that they in because they think that that's what's good for them and that's what the best that they can have. Sometimes they feel like I'm comfortable and I I'm happy. You know, I look at people that are in bad shape and they, you know, it's a a little girl, you know, she think she'd be getting over on me, you know, she she's a prostitute, you know, and she think she'll be getting on. You got $5 on you. I can catch the bus or something. I said, "Okay." Next time I said, "Yes, brother." So when I don't feel like giving her no money, I won't give her nothing. But I said, "You know, don't you want to go back to Winssboro where you from?" And she say she got children and all. Don't you want to go back? But look like she want, you know, we folks are want to help people, but sometime people just feel like, you know, I like doing what I'm doing. I like living what I how I'm living. I'm satisfied. I'm happy. Because this it the flesh, Amen, don't want to do right. We were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, and sin that our mother conceiveed. And the flesh don't want to do right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though others are making sacrifices that you can have have a better lifestyle, a better way. Amen. That you can do better. But yet we sat down. God had made heaven available. &gt;&gt; Amen. God. Amen. Amen. He wants to open your blind eyes and bring you out of darkness into the marvelous light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That this is a this is just a a wonderful life to live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a a the beauty of holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a Amen. This is a Oh, God. It's far beyond anything I could uh I I can't even express to you what what being a Christian mean to me &gt;&gt; and where I was and what I had to go through. You know, but thank God, you know, you know, sometimes people said, "I tried to to live a Christian life and I tried to do the right thing, but seemed like God didn't meet me." In other words, and I'm saying, you know, it looked like God can't do what he said when he sacrificed his life and he made the decision to die for you and he said, "I give you eternal life and I I'm not going to charge you anything for it. All I want you to do accept it and receive it. And if he gives it to you, Amen." And he gives you of his spirit. He gives you of his life. He gives it to you and you say, "Well, something wrong. I ain't got I ain't got what you said." It remind me of the blind man that the prophet prayed for and he said, "Uh, receive your sight, John Ryan or whatever." And the man, you know, walked away. He came back and got back in the prayer line. He said, "You told me I was I can see and I'm healed." He said, "Do you believe it?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "Go on, you heal. You can see." But the man was still blind. Ain't that right? And that's the way some folks are. That, you know, God said, "Your sins are forgiven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you you're forgiven. Your sins are forgiven. I'll give you eternal life. But the you said, well, I don't feel like I got eternal life. Ain't nothing changed. The way eternal life at my hair getting gray, I'm still, you know, I I I still ain't got much money. But he said, I give you eternal life. What's going on? I ain't I don't feel like I got it. I don't see it. I don't see it. He didn't say see it. He said believe it. You have faith by faith. You receive your sight. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; By faith. Amen. You receive your healing by faith. Amen. You accept what Jesus did for you by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not by sight, not by feeling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He died for your sin. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And if you believe that, then receive eternal life. &gt;&gt; Accepted. &gt;&gt; Amen. your pass from death to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you believe that, you can hold fast to that. &gt;&gt; Let me see read this St. John 5 and uh 24. Okay. It says, "Verily, verily I say unto you, he that hears my word and believeth on him that sent me," what? How many believe? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you believe, then you can have what? &gt;&gt; Everlasting life. &gt;&gt; Everlasting life.
