[35:37] amen amen are you happy to be in the
[35:40] house of the Lord tonight amen God is
[35:42] good
[35:48] amen if you have your Bibles tonight ask
[35:52] turn to Hebrews
[35:54] chapter actually Hebrews chapter 13
[36:08] very very familiar
[36:11] scripture and it's very fitting the last
[36:14] song the brother Gordon's song I love
[36:17] him amen because he first loved me
[36:22] amen I can find what I'm looking for
[36:25] tonight amen
[36:28] and I start at verse
[36:33] five let us go for therefore
[36:39] aunti Hebrews
[36:43] 13 no 13 13- 5 let your conversation be
[36:49] without Covetous and be constant with
[36:52] such things as you have for he has said
[36:55] I will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[36:58] so that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[37:01] helper and I will not fear what man
[37:03] shall do to me amen and and I'll turn
[37:07] back to Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 6
[37:10] and
[37:14] 7 for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[37:18] and Scorn every son whom he receiveth
[37:22] and if ye endure chastening God dealth
[37:25] with you as with Sons for what son is he
[37:30] what son is he whom the father
[37:32] chastenest not but with but if ye be
[37:35] without chastisement wherefore are you
[37:38] partakers then are ye bastards and not
[37:40] son furthermore we have had fathers of
[37:44] our flesh which corrected us and who GTH
[37:47] them
[37:48] reverence shall we not much rather be in
[37:52] subjection unto the father of spirits
[37:54] and live for there for for a few days
[37:57] chasing us after that our pleasure but
[38:00] he for our profit that we might be
[38:03] partakers of his
[38:04] Holiness amen God bless the reading of
[38:07] this where you may be
[38:09] seated amen I said the psalm was fitting
[38:11] because tonight I was thinking about a
[38:14] little subject and I entitled it God
[38:16] loves you God loves you and I was
[38:19] thinking about originally I thought
[38:21] about the question how do you know God
[38:24] loves you how do you know God loves you
[38:27] and I started thinking about the
[38:28] scripture Lord placed on my heart and
[38:30] and in verse six it said for whom the
[38:32] Lord loveth he chastens whom the Lord
[38:36] love is he corrects if God loves you
[38:39] he'll correct you and then I thought
[38:41] about well God loves you so much that
[38:44] many of times when he corrects you he
[38:46] gives the space and time for you to
[38:48] repent he gives you the opportunity for
[38:51] you to come to him God just don't
[38:53] correct you he gives you opportunity to
[38:55] repent and get it right
[38:57] and I thought about there was many
[38:58] stories and times in the Bible where God
[39:01] gave example but one that stood out to
[39:03] me was David and Nathan after David had
[39:06] done his sin and had taken Beba his as
[39:09] his wife Nathan came to him and God
[39:11] showed him what he had done David knew
[39:14] it was wrong but God had to point it out
[39:16] to him and said you did this and this is
[39:18] exactly what you did and this is the
[39:20] punishment but David got on his knees
[39:23] and said Lord I'm sorry even though
[39:25] David had the p for what he did he got
[39:27] the opportunity in the space to repent
[39:30] because God loved him and David was a
[39:32] man after God's Own Heart and said that
[39:35] God loves you and how do you know every
[39:37] time that you want to do something
[39:39] that's not right and that voice comes to
[39:41] you and tell you not to do it that's how
[39:44] you know God loves you every time that
[39:46] you want to make that wrong decision and
[39:47] God tells you don't go there you don't
[39:50] know what's going on but God said don't
[39:51] go there and you listen to that voice
[39:53] and you said is this me talking to
[39:55] myself and I heard Pastor said one time
[39:59] when the Lord spoke to him he said I
[40:00] never talked to myself like that he said
[40:03] when you go and you know it's wrong many
[40:05] of times you know deep then something
[40:07] that's in you saying that's not what I'm
[40:09] supposed to be doing that's not what I'm
[40:11] supposed to do that's God showing you
[40:13] that I love you God will protect you
[40:16] from things that you're not supposed to
[40:17] go to and he'll tell you don't do that
[40:20] cuz he's trying to protect you because
[40:21] he loves you the same way when your
[40:23] parent tell you not to go with hang out
[40:25] with those people
[40:27] they may not know the people but they
[40:28] understand what's going
[40:30] on why because they've been through life
[40:32] and they've understood things and
[40:34] they've experienced things that you have
[40:36] not experienced they've been around
[40:38] maybe not those people but people like
[40:40] them and they seen the roles that
[40:42] they've taken and know that those are
[40:44] not good paths but they tell you don't
[40:46] do that because they love you they love
[40:48] you and God loves you in the same way
[40:50] and the only reason he could he he
[40:53] chastised you is because he loves you
[40:55] and I started to think think about it in
[40:56] my own life and I started to think about
[40:59] I said how much God loved me when you
[41:02] think about the things that you've done
[41:04] in your life and you still get up every
[41:06] morning and you're allowed to repent and
[41:08] God and you allowed to get everything
[41:10] right and you allowed to thank God that
[41:13] he died for you you allowed to thank him
[41:15] and say Lord I Thank you for shedding
[41:17] your blood for me and he said what can
[41:20] wash away my sins nothing but the blood
[41:22] of Jesus and every morning that you get
[41:24] up that's another opport to thank God
[41:27] for the opportunity to give you thanks
[41:30] thank God for the opportunity for you to
[41:32] make things right I think Solomon said
[41:34] Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath
[41:36] and I took that scripture and I said
[41:38] Lord every night when I go to sleep I
[41:40] want to make sure everything is right
[41:41] before you cuz he said he comes as a
[41:44] thief in the night you don't know when
[41:46] he's coming but he can come for you he
[41:48] could come for you at any time and you
[41:50] don't want nothing to stop you from
[41:52] crossing
[41:53] over but God loves you that much that he
[41:55] went to Calvary just for you he went
[41:59] there and he endured the pain he it said
[42:01] in the scripture he endured the cross he
[42:04] endured the pain just for you he endured
[42:07] it for your healing he endured it for
[42:10] your salvation he endured it so that you
[42:12] could overcome he endured it that you
[42:15] can make it to Heaven he endured these
[42:17] things that you think um you might not
[42:19] think of them but sometimes you need to
[42:21] be reminded you got to go back and you
[42:24] remind yourself what God has brought you
[42:25] through
[42:26] you got to remind yourself you know what
[42:28] I came through this and I came through
[42:30] that but it's only by the grace of God
[42:33] and each and every day that I get up I
[42:35] can say Lord I love you because you
[42:37] first loved me Lord I thank you because
[42:39] you first loved me you saw me before the
[42:42] foundation of the world and you still
[42:44] thought enough of me to decide to choose
[42:47] me to write my name down and say Lord
[42:50] put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[42:52] that's what he decided to do Just
[42:54] Because You Loved Me Lord just because
[42:56] you love me and I can never repay you
[42:58] for that love there's nothing there not
[43:01] only thing that I can do is surrender
[43:03] and give my life to you that's the best
[43:05] gift that I can give God and that's
[43:07] still not good enough that's the best
[43:10] gift that I can give him is my life and
[43:12] that's still not good good
[43:14] enough and I and I read here he said he
[43:18] loved you and he said I'll never leave
[43:19] you nor forsake you he said I think in
[43:22] another scripture he said I'll never
[43:24] leave you comfortless and and then he
[43:26] said he would give us the comforter
[43:28] which was the Holy Ghost see he loved
[43:30] you enough to said you know what I'm
[43:32] going to come down and dwell within you
[43:34] each and every day I'm going to walk
[43:36] right inside of you and I'm going to
[43:38] tell you and lead you and guide you each
[43:40] and every day now who do you know that
[43:43] your best friend won't even do that your
[43:46] best friend Won't Stand By Your Side
[43:48] through everything there's still going
[43:50] to be moments that your best friend
[43:52] cannot be there but God promised because
[43:54] he loved you so much he said I'll still
[43:56] be there he said I'll be there through
[43:59] the thick and the thin through the ups
[44:00] and the Downs he was still there I think
[44:03] I was listening one they said that God
[44:05] never leaves you he promised that but
[44:08] you can leave him you can leave God but
[44:11] God never leaves you and sometimes you
[44:14] got to go back to those moments and say
[44:17] where did I leave God where did I leave
[44:20] God you wonder why things aren't going
[44:22] right and say Lord I got to examine
[44:24] myself I got to look at myself and say
[44:27] why are these things not going right why
[44:30] why is this thing happening to me and
[44:32] this thing happening to me and it could
[44:33] be a job situation where God love you so
[44:36] much he said I trust you I trust you to
[44:39] go through this I trust you because you
[44:41] love me so much and it's not just what
[44:44] I'm doing for you that is proving my
[44:46] love it's not just the blessings that
[44:49] I'm giving you that proves how much you
[44:51] love me now you're not just thanking me
[44:53] because God has blessed me you thanking
[44:55] me in spite of in spite of all the
[44:58] blessings I can still thank God in spite
[45:01] of all the good I can still thank God
[45:03] cuz I thank him for the good and even
[45:05] when it's going bad I can thank God
[45:07] because he loved me and because he first
[45:10] loved us we can thank
[45:14] him I said it's not the question of how
[45:16] much he loves us but how much do you
[45:19] love him how much do you love him and I
[45:22] was reading something I want to read it
[45:24] tonight and he said
[45:27] he knew as the prophet of God said he
[45:29] knew as Romans 8 tells us that he could
[45:32] see God knew us before the foundation of
[45:34] the world and he said and he hated Esau
[45:36] and loved Jacob before they were even
[45:39] born God knew the children that was in
[45:42] the womb he knew what they were going to
[45:44] do and he said he hated one and he loved
[45:46] the other he hated Esau and he loved
[45:48] Jacob but either before either boy was
[45:52] born for his foreign knowledge allows
[45:56] him to predestinate all things to work
[45:59] together for to his good see because God
[46:04] created everything and God knew
[46:06] everything it allowed him to
[46:08] predestinate all things to work together
[46:11] to his glory that's why God could say in
[46:14] his word all things work together to the
[46:17] good because he knew all things he knew
[46:20] what was going to happen he knew the
[46:21] path that you was going to take and knew
[46:23] that everything was going to work out to
[46:25] the good so he could say with confidence
[46:27] I can write your name here you're gonna
[46:29] make it he said with confidence I can
[46:32] write your name there you're gonna make
[46:34] it he said with confidence I can write
[46:36] your name there cuz you're going to make
[46:37] it and he loved you so much he said I'm
[46:40] I know that they're going to make the
[46:42] right decision I know that they're going
[46:43] to choose the right path because he had
[46:46] four knowledge that allowed him to
[46:49] predestinate all things to work together
[46:51] to his glory that's the great Jehovah
[46:54] isn't it him that willth or he that
[46:56] runneth isn't God that showeth Mercy see
[47:00] God is the one that showeth mercy no
[47:02] matter how much you think that you do on
[47:05] others God still show Greater Mercy than
[47:08] you can ever accept or you can ever
[47:10] believe God to give you the mercy amen
[47:14] and he said that's what the scripture
[47:16] says so it isn't how much you try you
[47:20] know sometimes we look and we say well I
[47:21] did this and I did this and I did this
[47:23] so I expect this we work on a job and
[47:27] say well I completed this and completed
[47:28] that and completed this so you expect
[47:30] something but with God is not how much
[47:33] you try because you can't try enough to
[47:36] get what God has given you that's why he
[47:38] gave it as a gift there's nothing that
[47:41] you have to do to to get this all you
[47:43] have to do is accept it all you have to
[47:46] do is accept it so it's not how much you
[47:49] try is it's how much God has done for
[47:52] you and if you got enough a God to to
[47:55] come out here tonight a desire to hear
[47:58] the message you ought to be the happiest
[47:59] person in the
[48:01] city because God is moving in your life
[48:05] I thought about this and it was very
[48:07] impactful and said you know sometimes
[48:09] you try your best just to make it to the
[48:10] house of God and the prophet of God said
[48:13] if you got that desire you ought to be
[48:15] the happiest person here because God is
[48:18] moving in your life just to have the
[48:20] desire shows that God is moving in your
[48:23] life and you wonder how much God loves
[48:25] you
[48:26] God gives you
[48:27] desires and if your desire is to please
[48:30] him it means that God is moving in your
[48:33] life God is working in your life he's
[48:35] trying to lead you to the Fountain he
[48:38] said he loves you God loves you he loves
[48:42] you so much that he'll lead you to him
[48:44] he'll lead you out of Darkness into the
[48:47] light he'll lead you out of the wrong
[48:49] path into the right one he'll put people
[48:51] in your path to stop you from going in
[48:53] the wrong direction he'll put people
[48:55] there that that give you wisdom and say
[48:57] don't do this do this it may not you may
[49:01] not think of it as great things but
[49:03] those things can alter and change your
[49:05] path of your life you may not think of
[49:07] this person that said hey do this right
[49:09] here and you didn't think it was nothing
[49:11] big but you did it you don't know why
[49:13] sometimes you don't know why you listen
[49:15] but God is leading you and guiding you
[49:18] and keeping you if you give your life to
[49:20] him he'll lead you and guide you it's
[49:22] because he loves you he loves you so
[49:25] much that he gave his life for you all
[49:28] that he wants in return is your life if
[49:30] you to come to him and say Lord I accept
[49:33] you Lord I'm willing to do whatever you
[49:35] ask me to do and you totally give it to
[49:39] him many times you give it to him and
[49:41] you think that you're doing but then in
[49:42] a space of time you forget or you might
[49:45] or you might get slack and you and you
[49:47] don't do you you forget where you going
[49:49] and what you supposed to do and God has
[49:52] to remind you sometimes he takes you
[49:54] through trials and tribulations to
[49:56] remind you that I'm still God he takes
[49:59] you through the ups and the Downs the
[50:01] hills and then he takes you through the
[50:03] valleys so that you can appreciate the
[50:05] mountaintops he takes you through the
[50:07] valley so that you can you can
[50:09] understand when you get up and you can
[50:10] see you can look back and see where God
[50:12] has brought you from you can look back
[50:14] and say Lord thank you for loving me
[50:18] Lord thank you for loving me in spite of
[50:21] everything that I've done in spite of
[50:23] what people have done to me and spite of
[50:26] what I've been through Lord in spite of
[50:28] what I'm going through thank you for
[50:30] loving me you love me so much that you
[50:32] given me the desire to please you you
[50:36] Des giving me the desire to every
[50:38] morning get up and thank you you giving
[50:40] me the desire every day to say Lord I
[50:42] love you Lord I Thank You Lord I
[50:45] appreciate everything that you've done
[50:47] for me and I can't tell you enough how
[50:49] much I love you I can't tell you enough
[50:51] how much I appreciate you because he
[50:53] loves you and he loved us and I said how
[50:57] do you know he loves you because when
[50:59] you do wrong he will correct you when
[51:02] you do wrong he comes back and he he may
[51:05] give you that but he'll say I love you
[51:07] any good parent is going to do the same
[51:09] thing and God is the best that we can he
[51:12] said Our Father which aren't in heaven
[51:14] he's a father to you he he's a leader to
[51:17] you he's a God to you he's someone
[51:20] that'll be always be there for you
[51:22] there's no greater friend that you can
[51:24] have than the Lord Jesus Jus Christ
[51:26] there's no one that's going to lead you
[51:27] better than the Lord Jesus Christ even
[51:30] your parents can't lead you better than
[51:32] the Lord even your grandparents can't
[51:34] lead you better than the Lord no one can
[51:36] lead you better than the Lord and when
[51:38] he comes inside of you he'll lead and
[51:40] guide you each and every day but you got
[51:42] to listen you got to get down and you
[51:45] got to commune with God you got to talk
[51:46] to him just like every day you talk to
[51:49] someone else you can talk to God he
[51:51] don't require nothing special he don't
[51:53] say that you got to do it in a special
[51:55] Mighty way he said when the weakest
[51:57] Christian get on their knees to to pray
[52:00] then the whole Kingdom of the devil
[52:02] shakes cuz he know that prayer can
[52:04] change things he knew that prayer can
[52:07] can move mountains he know that prayer
[52:09] can come in homes and change homes he
[52:12] know that prayer can come and change
[52:13] situations that no nothing else can
[52:16] do it's you don't have to be somewhat
[52:19] great that don't have to be the pastor
[52:20] the preacher is when you get down on
[52:22] your knees and pray when you get down
[52:24] and say Lord I need your help there's
[52:27] nothing else that can help me but you
[52:29] there's nothing else that can change
[52:31] this but you Mama might have tried Daddy

[52:37] but you but God loves us enough that he
[52:40] allowed us to come to him and say Lord
[52:42] change this Lord work in this and
[52:46] sometimes he'll do exactly what you ask
[52:48] him to he'll do exactly what you ask him
[52:51] sometimes you have to be more specific
[52:53] with your prayers cuz God will do it but
[52:55] you might not like the process but God
[52:58] loves you enough to take you through the
[53:00] process to show you that I love you to
[53:02] show you that I love you and I and and
