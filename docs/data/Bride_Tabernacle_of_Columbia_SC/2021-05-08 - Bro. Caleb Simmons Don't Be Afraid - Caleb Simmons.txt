sicknesses and diseases lord lord we look over the world and we see lord that you are such a mighty god and such a wonderful god and lord we thank you and lord we ask that you come down in this in this place tonight and lord touch every need lord speak to every desire speak to every heart lord jesus those that are here those that are watching and listening and lord jesus continue to touch us lord bless your word and touch your people in jesus name we pray amen amen we'd like to turn to the book of mark mark chapter six mark chapter six verse forty five we read a few verses there amen when you gotta say amen amen mark chapter six verse four forty five and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaidia while he sent away the people and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land and he saw them toiling and rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately he talked with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were so amazed in themselves beyond measure and wonder for they consider not the miracle of the loaves for their hearts were hardened amen god bless to read another word you may be seated amen tonight we'd like to speak on a little topic entitled don't be afraid don't be afraid and the book of mark here is this is a story about jesus walking on water and you see he the story goes that the lord was tired so he told them to get on the ship and he went into the mountain to pray now that's now the prophet of god he speaks in the sermon and the sermon entitled be not afraid he speaks on there and he says that the disciples they were he told them to get in the ship and they went to rowan and they went out there and everything looked calmed and but at the moment in time they got distracted they got distracted and they left jesus behind he told them to go and so they they didn't persuade him to come with him they left him behind because those were his words and he said he said that the that that the disciples they got distracted stand by they got distracted by the seed they got distracted by moving forward and then jesus he said said that the lord he got up there and even in the scripture says the lord he went up into the mountain to pray and sometimes looking at god was watching he was looking down and at the whole time while they were in the midst of the storm when the sea arose and the storm rose and the winds blew and they were tossing and turning and on that sea god was watching the whole time and they got in the ship and they were afraid they were i'm gonna lose my life i'm these things are going to capsize this ship all these storms all these winds are going to push me over and going to take me out and this might not be might not have any more chances or this might be my last time but they never they never realized that god was watching him the whole time he was standing on the mountain he was looking down and he never he never let the winds he never let it go so far that it would take them that it would take them out and and he never let the winds and he said that's what the devil wants to get you he wants to get you separated from god separated from him distracted things come up things and you were just looking at your problems your circumstances you're not looking at that he's watching over you the whole time you become you start to doubt you start to you start to become afraid of the things that are around you not realizing that god got you that he understands what you're going through and he won't put more on you and you can bear the scripture says the scripture says um and the scripture said if god be for us then who can be against us it says that in romans 8 and 31 he said to god before us then who can be against us and don't be afraid of what's going on because in the midst of everything that's going on god always knew the plan he always knew what you were going to face he always knew what you were going to see he always knew what was going to come up and he said that he had never put more on you than you can bear and he'll never give you more than you're supposed to and you're supposed to have because if god gives you the test in the trial he gave you the will and knew that you were going to be able to withstand he knew that you were going to be able to make it he knew that you were going to be able to go through it and process through it and god was going to give you the strength he was going to give you the the power to be able to withstand the storm and he knew that their faith was failing in that he knew that they were sinking he knew that they needed encouragement so then he said you know what i'm going to go watch them i'm gonna go i'm gonna go to them to show them that i'm here i was watching but now i gotta go down and see my people i gotta go visit my people to show them that i am here i am with you and he he got in the ship and he said be of good cheer it is i be not afraid so you don't have to be afraid because god is out there he watching he looking at you he watching you in the school he's watching you in the homes he watching you at the job he's watching you he's he's putting his hedge about you and he said i got you i understand that it gets hard i understand that the trials of life are coming towards you things are on every hand but don't worry i'm gonna show up i'm gonna show up because you don't have to be afraid because i'll never leave you nor forsake you he'll be with you always even to the end amen and god has been so good and understanding that that he was watching over us i think in daniel chapter 3 about the hebrew boys and daniel chapter 3 with the hebrew boys he said in in the scripture they said let me just turn there daniel chapter 3. in the hebrew boys we know that nebuchadnezzar he built a he built a statue so many cubics high of gold and a statue in the and the three hebrew boys that recognized that it was a idol it was not the god of gods that had brought them that brought their people through the wilderness that had delivered them from pharaoh and he said thou shalt not put no other gods before me and in verse 16 it says and they come before the king and they would not bow to it and they came before king nebuchadnezzar and and they and nebuchadnezzar is asking them why won't you bow and they said it doesn't matter what you do if you threaten us to throw us in the fiery furnace we're not going to bow and verse 16 it says shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king oh nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fire reforms and he will deliver us out of thine hand but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up they said if if god don't deliver me i still won't bow i still won't be afraid of what you what you can do to me because in the end of the road god already knew what was supposed to happen if i die today well i died knowing that i live i live the right life i live for the lord and the lord will always see his people he'll always watch over he always rewards them that diligently seek him amen and shadrach meshach and abednego they said we're not careful we're not even worried we're not even careful with how we answer you in this matter because they knew that if god be for us then who can be against us and they came and nebuchadnezzar they were able to be a witness to nebuchadnezzar they they got further down the scripture if you read it long further in that chapter you'll see where they got in the fiery furnace they were bound before they got there the heat was so hot it was killing the people that was taking them to the fiery furnace it was killing the people that were leading them there and they got into the but it never scarred them and never burned them even going into the fire furnace then when they finally got in there the only thing the fire burned was their change the only thing that the fire burned was the things that was holding them back from praising god the only thing that held them that was burned was their clothes didn't even burn they they were so protected by god that there was not even a smell of smoke on their clothes nothing was sins but the things that was holding them back from praising god and they got in and nebuchadnezzar was looking in that fiery furnace he looked there and he seen he said didn't we throw three men in there and then he looked twice he said i thought we threw three man he looked to his right he looked to his right and he said i thought we'd do three and they said we did he looked to his left i thought we threw three why why am i seeing four and the fourth man looks like the son of god nebuchadnezzar recognized that someone else was in that furnace and not just someone it was the son of god that was in that furnace with them and he called unto them and he told them to come on out of their fiery furnace and he said that he told him he said the god that you serve is not like like the ones that we serve it's the one and true god nebuchadnezzar recognized there was something different and also with don't be afraid don't be afraid to take a stand don't be afraid to stand up for for the lord stand up wherever you are don't be afraid to take to step forth and move forward and say lord i'm standing for you i'm standing for what's right i'm standing for what i believe because i know that lord that you never failed me and lord no matter how people may pick people may look at me wrong people may look at me disdain but in the end of the road it's not the reward the bible says lay not up for yourself treasures on earth where moth and rust do does corrupt but lay up for yourself treasures on heaven when neither moth nor rust does grow up nor thieves do break through and steal so it's not about the rewards that's here it's about the rewards that when you want to get to the lord and say you want to hear him say well done good and faithful servant because you stood for him you weren't afraid to take that stand when your friends looked at you so weird and your friends looked at you some type of way it didn't matter because you knew what god had done for you you knew that god was watching over you you knew that god was keeping you he was protecting you he was putting a hedge about you you knew that god was even though things things may not be going in the way that you thought god always had a plan that was right for your life and even going forward he said coming forward even to you can't be afraid to give god your life you can't be afraid to give him your all and commit to it and say that lord i accept you into my life because i want to give you my whole life my entire my will my plan my desires lord you take control don't be afraid to give them your life but then don't stop there don't be afraid to move forward there's steps past the steps past sanctification you got to go to justification and then there's give getting the baptism of the holy ghost so don't be afraid to get the justification and then stop and say i'm good no there's more to it you have to go and get the gift of god that he freely gives to each and every last one of us he said come to me all you that are heavy laden and heavy burden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me while me can lowly and still and you shall have rest for my soul so god promised to take your burdens the son one songwriter says take your burdens to the lord and leave them there amen he decided that he was going to bear your burdens he went to calvary for each and every one of us to save us to give us a way of escape in the old testament they had to continue to sacrifice lambs ghosts and for all their sins but god said come unto me and and lay your sins before me and i'll wash them white as snow amen i think what david said yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and my staff that come from me that protect prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemy amen i anointed my head with oil surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the presence of the lord forever amen david knew he had been through some experiences with god he knew that god was with him the bible says that david was a man after god's own heart and you see that he wrote the longest book in the bible because he had he said if i had 10 000 tongues i couldn't praise you enough david knew that he couldn't be afraid of what god was going to do even if he did not know the plan even if he didn't understand what was going to happen he knew that he had to put his whole trust in god and not not in himself because he recognized that i can do nothing i can do nothing without god one songwriter said without god i can do nothing without him i would fail without him i will be drifting like a ship without a sail and i uh it's i understand that you think of another songwriter they said because he lives i can face tomorrow because he went to calvary and died for you and me i don't have to be afraid i don't have to stand there and wonder what's going to happen because i know that god has me in his hands he's watching over me he's protecting me he's keeping me so i can surrender my life to him i can decide lord i want you to be the head over my life i want to put you first because you know what's best for me you you got a plan that i even can't understand i don't understand sometimes i look back even in my life why i had to go through things and then years past time passed and you look back and you see how god was working how god was moving so some things you're going through and you don't understand but you can't be afraid in the midst of the trials in the midst of the test the don't be afraid of what's going to take place because god understands he understands your needs he he said that i will supply all your needs and he according to his riches and and mercies i think of how joshua and caleb when they came to the they came to the land and they went to spy out the land and they came back and there were eight people in front of them that testified we can't do it we can't they got up and they gave a testimony in front of the congregation and church that we we won't be able to possess this land it's too many giants there's too many obstacles it's too many things have you seen them look at the fruit that's in there and it took two people to bring the fruit out of there and said there's too many obstacles for us to possess it but caleb and joshua they knew that we can't be afraid god already promised us that that's our inheritance and they said we are more than able to conquer this land we don't don't doubt god because god already gave us a word and said we are more than able to take this land joshua and caleb they knew that they couldn't be afraid rahab the harlot all she had was a word all she had was a word she just knew that she had spared them and they said hang this cord here that's all she had to trust on she didn't have no bible to read she didn't have no no thus saith the lord she had a word from god's people that said hang this court here and you and your family will be saved and that and she trusted in that word she gave her undivided you know what i i have nothing to lose but to believe i have nothing to lose but to give my trust to the lord i have nothing to lose to believe in the god of jehovah because he brought up we've heard the stories of what god has done for you and your people she trusted him so so much that she said i'm on not only save me but save my family i'm going to bring everyone that i know into this house that will listen that will hear because i i know that i got a word from god that if they come in here and i hang here then all i have is a word and you think about the story of jesus met the harlot at the well in samaria and he met her on that road and the disciples was wondering why would he stay back to speak to what what the bible says as an ill-famed woman and he said that they they got there and they started congregating you know let's let's watch this let's hide over here in the bushes let's watch his interaction between jesus and the and the young lady and they said that jesus would ask the question he asked the question of the woman at the well he asked her he said where's my husband and they got over there and they said oh okay that's a good question so they got over there and they thought about it and she said i have no husband and all them over there thinking well he didn't well i thought he was the one but you know he got something wrong and then jesus came out of his mouth and he said he said you speak the truth you have no husband he said and and the one that you have five husbands the one that you with is not yours and jesus and they got over there and they were astonished the disciples were astonished just imagine just being there listening to this interaction and and understanding but she understood that she was she was in the midst of someone great she understood that this was not a normal interaction she had met someone she thought it was a prophet and she said and she asked him our dial prophet he said no i'm the one that was sent to to be the light for the age and she said our fathers told us of this thing and jesus said i am he and and she and the revelation struck her that she didn't have to be afraid no more she didn't she was so it struck so so in such a way that she ran back and told everyone and it struck us so and they knew something had changed so drastically that they came and saw the man that they saw the one that she was talking about because if god could do that for her what could he do for me if god could change her in such a drastic way she became she was no longer afraid to tell the story after all the things all the things that her past everyone that knew her and knew the things that she had been through understood that god had something had happened that was real a change had taken place she had she had given over she wasn't afraid to tell her testimony because she knew that god god had done something for her had changed her life and she wanted everyone to know she wanted everyone to know and not only she didn't even have to tell half the people they just saw they just looked upon her and saw that this is a change and going saying that don't be afraid don't be afraid to to step out on faith and believe god don't be afraid to step out on his word and say lord you said in your word when two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst lord so whatever i need lord you said that you supply all my deeds and everything that i need lord if you need salvation if you need heal and deliverance if you need power if you just need god to come and do something special in your life you don't have to be afraid because he will do it he will come and he will stand by you he will he will take everything that he is supposed to that he wants to do in your life and he will do it but you have to completely surrender you have to completely give your life to to the lord and say lord this is no longer mine but it's yours as the lord said it said in the prayer of gethsemane lord not my will but thy will be done and that's and just understanding the lord no longer even though he didn't want to take that cup he said lord not my will he wasn't he wasn't afraid because he knew how it would change and he gave us an opportunity to to save us he gave an opportunity a way to make it back to god to intercede for us amen and it's such a powerful thing to be able to give your life to god it's such a powerful thing to be able to say lord i trust you i give you everything lord i give you everything all my wills all my plans all my desires and know that he got you when other people are failing and list this and wondering what th what what should i do with my life you can give it to him and realize lord you got it you got that plan you got that thing and lord i trust you i believe in you and and i give everything to you in jesus name amen praise god amen i said god is good amen be not afraid amen it is our amen praise god be not afraid it is uh jesus still walks on water amen he still does the impossible he's still calm to rage at sea what he did yesterday he's the same god today he's in no situation no problem no storm that he can't come no wind that he cannot speak to the wind speak to the storm amen so god can speak to your storms he could speak to the wind he can calm the rage and see so it's nothing that god did then that he cannot do now amen if he did it then we could have that assurance that he's the same god yesterday today and forever and all we have to do is say god you're the same and i'm going to stand here i'm not afraid when i'm going through my storm i know you're there amen somehow the scripture said see jesus saw them tall then and when he saw him tall and on that sea he knew amen they was trying to amen get where they were going but they needed help so jesus just came walking on the wall amen in the midst of what we go through amen then jesus came our life amen needed a change jesus came walking he walked right in when i needed him the most jesus came i don't know where you were when he came i don't know what you were going through when he came but here come when you're going through you're trying time and i believe that's what is needed many times because sometimes people come and they thought when everything is going swell and well and everything and sometimes they don't fully recognize the impact of what salvation means and what god has done for sometimes they just you know they just it's just like jesus said the woman that has sinned much she'll love him much but sometimes folk amen they just think i i hadn't been bad enough i hadn't done anything wrong and they can't seem to love god uh enough to give them their own and sometimes god can deliver folk from so many things and but there's the they're getting amnesia they forget what what god done for him and where he bought them from amen so never forget amen then when god amen calm your troubled waters when god saved you when it came to you when you were going through your stone don't never forget what god done for you because there's so many people amen the reason they don't praise him because they forget wait amen amen there was a status amen praise god oh can't you see walking on a stormy sea praise god i can see them thinking it's in the spirit they meant but jesus stepped in the ship and everything got calm i'm gonna tell you something when jesus stepped in your i said when jesus steps into your ship hallelujah i believe he'll step in your ship tonight amen he'll step in your situation he'll step in your troubles amen here come your seat tonight hallelujah praise god hallelujah i believe they saw him amen and they knew that it was him praise god when he got there hallelujah i'm telling you amen brother and sister all you got to do is recognize it's him amen it's him walking on the water it's him amen that's giving you that little nudge amen that's saying i'm here i i i'm here it is i be not afraid of what you're going through right now don't be afraid but it is i hallelujah let your fears disappear jesus is here now god
