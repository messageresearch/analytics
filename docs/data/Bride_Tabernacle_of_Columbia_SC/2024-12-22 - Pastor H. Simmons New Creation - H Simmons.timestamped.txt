[31:20] 20 1 Corinthians 15 and 20 amen
[31:30] God is good
[31:32] amen time is
[31:35] late he said but now in Christ now is
[31:40] Christ risen from the
[31:44] dead and become the first fruits of them
[31:48] that
[31:50] slept for Since By Man Came Death by man
[31:55] came also the resurrection of the
[31:58] dead as in Adam all died even so in
[32:03] Christ shall all be made
[32:06] alive but every man in his own order
[32:10] Christ the first fruit afterward they
[32:12] that are Christ at is
[32:15] coming then cometh the end when he shall
[32:19] have delivered up the kingdom of God
[32:23] even the
[32:25] father when he shall have put down all
[32:29] rules and all authority and power for he
[32:33] must Reign till he has put all enemies
[32:37] under his feet and The Last Enemy that
[32:41] shall be destroyed is
[32:44] there God bless to read this word you
[32:47] may be
[32:50] seated want to talk about a new
[32:54] creation we understand this is around
[32:57] where day the world want to call uh uh
[33:00] the birth of Jesus Christ the birth of
[33:02] the Son of God and uh it's around that
[33:05] time and it's people love to give gifts
[33:09] and different things and people are nice
[33:14] around that time Merry Christmas
[33:16] hallelujah thank you Jesus you can be
[33:19] nice and smile so we don't want to stop
[33:22] stop people for smiling but we know that
[33:25] you know that Rome adopted this 25th day
[33:28] of December and it came in as the son
[33:31] got birthday and and it's actually
[33:33] Christ mass or whatever but that's all
[33:36] right you know uh to most people it's
[33:40] just a tradition anyway it's just like
[33:43] Thanksgiving having a
[33:45] turkey so by the grace of God I'm not
[33:48] going to bother the people amen they
[33:51] feel good so by the grace of God just
[33:54] know the truth the Bible say you should
[33:56] know the truth and the truth to make you
[33:58] free amen so by the grace of God we want
[34:01] to talk about this new creation because
[34:04] the birth of Jesus Christ was on this
[34:07] wise when as his uh uh the mother Mary
[34:11] was espoused to a man called Joseph
[34:14] before they came together she was found
[34:16] with the child amen and the Holy Ghost
[34:21] amen had overshadowed Mary and God had
[34:26] spoke Gabriel had spoke spoke to Mary
[34:29] about having a child and and she wanted
[34:32] to know how can this thing be saying
[34:35] that I don't know a
[34:36] man amen so the child was to be born it
[34:41] was only fulfill what God
[34:44] told uh Eve When sin came in and the
[34:48] serpent he told her that thou
[34:52] seed amen is going to Bruises the heel
[34:56] and her seed is going to bruise the head
[35:00] of the serpent are you with me so there
[35:03] was going to be two seeds the serpent
[35:04] seed and the woman's seed and we realize
[35:08] that a female does not have the
[35:11] seed so we realize that uh Christ was a
[35:17] seed that he was speaking of a virgin
[35:21] shall
[35:22] conceed so as we had on Sunday school
[35:25] this morning that
[35:28] Eve the
[35:29] serpent got to Eve before
[35:32] Adam are you with me and we understand
[35:38] that before Joseph got to Mary she was F
[35:42] with the child of the Holy Ghost are you
[35:45] with me
[35:47] amen y'all with me so by the grace of
[35:51] God we see the
[35:53] contrast amen so as we look at the 40 uh
[35:57] second verse of this 15th chapter uh
[36:00] let's just look at it for a moment it
[36:08] says for also is the resurrection of the
[36:11] Dead is swn in corruption it is raised
[36:15] Incorruptible amen and then he says it
[36:19] is sown in dishonor it is raised in
[36:22] glory it is sown in weakness it is
[36:24] raised in power it is sown the Natural
[36:27] Body it is risen a spiritual body
[36:30] there's a natural body and there's a
[36:32] spiritual
[36:33] body and so it is written the
[36:39] first Adam was made a living Soul the
[36:44] last Adam was made a quickening spirit
[36:49] so we want to talk about the natural man
[36:51] and the spiritual man so when we talk
[36:54] about the new creation amen we find that
[36:58] Adam amen was uh of the first
[37:01] creation and the first Adam amen the
[37:05] bought for
[37:07] children amen but that we understand
[37:09] that Satan had corrupted the first
[37:13] man so we understand that that creation
[37:16] was a a a
[37:19] corruptible but the last Adam which was
[37:22] Christ was to bring forth a new creation
[37:25] a new generation amen amen amen a a a
[37:30] people that wasn't subject to sin amen
[37:34] sin would not have dominion over this
[37:37] new creation amen yes you you you you
[37:43] become new
[37:45] creatures amen so when we talk about the
[37:48] new creation Now all this world if
[37:51] without Christ all you got to look
[37:53] forward to is to die am
[37:59] is no if and a man that is vulnerable a
[38:02] woman a few days full of trouble without
[38:05] Jesus Christ all you got to look forward
[38:08] to him is dy amen but if you got Jesus
[38:13] Christ amen you got eternal life amen so
[38:18] the the first Adam Amen in Adam the
[38:21] first Adam all died amen everyone died
[38:27] died in the first atom so if you were
[38:30] born of a woman amen all you had to look
[38:33] forward to is trouble and dying amen are
[38:37] you with me amen but this new creation
[38:40] Now who want all I mean you live uh uh
