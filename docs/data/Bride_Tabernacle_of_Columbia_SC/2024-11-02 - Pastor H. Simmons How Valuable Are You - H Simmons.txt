God I pray that you moved here tonight in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] I guess it's a little warm up here uh Matthew 16 and 24 I was just sharing a little last night in marins and I was talking and end up preaching a little bit but we'll try to just slow down a little bit we been going pretty steady it says then said Jesus unto the disciples If any man come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me I think brother Caleb was talking about that and whosoever shall save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it and for what profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own own soul and what shall a man give in exchange for his soul the son of man should come in his glory of his father and with with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his Works God bless you read word you may be seated we were talking on last night about how valuable are you you know we find that people that don't have moral values usually don't it's a reason why they don't have moral values and then we were talking about the uh the Youth of the hour the day that we live in and look like like you know with all the gangs and violence people don't value life they don't mind killing one another shooting one another and just have no regard for life and that's the kind of world we live in then we look at the walls that are taking place and it seem as though it used to be a time when people wouldn't fight in the inner cities and populated areas they try to meet in no man's land and um where nobody dwell and they try to meet the enemy in that kind of place but nowadays we got to go into urban cities which is never thought of we going to urvan cities and and just people it doesn't matter what it is I mean either way people just they just just getting real violent the world is getting very Wicked very violent and you know it's it was like that in the days of Noah every thought imagination of man heart was continually evil it got so wicked got so violent to God looked down and he said I it repented me that I made man you know and I believe if he did it that in that day I believe he's doing it now it repented him that he's made man and then the book of Peter says and second Peter 3 said that since the fathers fell asleep all men continued as his word from the beginning of creation he said for this they willingly ignorant of talked about how it was in the days of Noah and how it was in the days of Sodom God God may wait a long time but judgment coming I said judgment coming amen we might in our life might do our own thing and do what we want big and bad and nothing but I said how do you value how valuable are you do you value life life do you value your soul how valuable are you do you value your soul do you value your life sometimes we take it for granted that we're living why every day we live we're dying because what happens man born in the world it looks like he grows to a certain level then after while he started dying you start seeing the outside that man is really is really dying why because you get a little slower you hair get gray teeth might fall out or whatever steps get slow and nothing you can do to stop it can't run as fast not as strong as you used to be it getting a little weak so what is going on as the prophet said we eating the same food but what what makes us begin to go to he said a man that's born of a woman is few days full of trouble that's it but do you value you you value this life a lots of people people they are taking for granted they're building their bodies they're going out to eat and and they're trying to do everything they can do to preserve and to be healthy and live a a healthy life where they can walk and you know preserve themselves for a few more days if I can only live a few more days that'll be fine so people are doing things uh to uh uh show that you know I'm concerned about my natural health and my natural life I'm doing something because I care about my body I care about my mind so uh when you care about your mind you begin to do things that would cause your mind you know I I I never uh wouldn't tell a person to do certain games you almost children got little games I was I had a book like I I say it all the time Tero in the toy box and they said the computers and things that they were sending over here to America what the the reason why the children was having so much mental problem so those games were condition to put your mind in that condition there you know that have you uh have seizures and do things to you and it was noticed that certain games were giving children seizures and when that was way back when we study that back in the 70s you know just just what is it doing to our children today when when every child has got a game they're playing and the parents think nothing of it you tell them better then they don't think nothing of it why because you well people don't listen they used to listen they wouldn't give a child one of those games instead of give them educational things and things that's going to be Godly things they don't care what the child look at they don't care what the child play they don't care they're just busy parents are busy and grown up are busy they don't have time but it used to be be a time where we value things we value what your child looked at what your child did you know you value that now people are going to the movie and see demons and devils and they who and they wonder how their minds going to be messed up what kind of effect it's going to have on their lives and they know they don't know that those spirits that they left the movie with those Spirits sometimes they've gotten in their bodies but they don't even know that they have been captivated by these spirits and these Spirits have gotten in them now people don't want you to talk about it stay away from that don't tell the people nothing just let them you know you know we want to come to church and we want to hear the Jesus love you yeah he loves you and but we come to you know uh God wants you to be knowledgeable you know God wants you to understand that this world is full of deception and you got to you know value you got to be careful mindful for what you see what you look at what you spend your time with valueing life valueing you how valuable are you or how valuable of your Soul you heard the prophet of God said one soul is worth more than how many 10,000 what 10,000 world you know one soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds yet you know uh what a man thinks about his soul he says here he said what in the 26th verse and what profit a man if he what gain the whole world and lose it Soul so what prophet of man if he gains the whole world but I'm going to tell you something things that are important and are valuable to us we actually you know we value going to school and getting education we value you know exercise we value things but do we value God's word is God word and important to us amen do you value your soul and I ask your question and I'm asking it again can you be bought you know it was a time when slaves they had the slave market and they said 40% of all the slaves came through chareston so South Carolina was a state that you know really had a lot of slaves and you said well what are you saying I'm saying people when I it's not a history class concerning slavery but a lot of times people don't want to realize that they're slaves one way or another you can be a slave to sin and a slave the the Bible say you cannot serve what two two masters are you with me you either love the one and hate the other you can't serve God in mamama ain't that right so whether we like it or not you can become a slave to the world system this world has an order has a cycle and I was listening to a very intelligent man I guess a genius for a little while and I said he show need Jesus he knew a whole lot about psychology and the different terminologies and read books time books and very intelligent and all I can say he show need Jesus so he was talking about he was going he was having therapy and and when he thought talked about it I I believe every one of us need therapy cuz he convinced me that I needed therapy and it'll help every one of us to get therapy and I thought about it I said we need sometimes sometimes we need to empty out and talk as a church we need we need to sometimes just get together and talk Fellowship because that's therapy you know what I'm saying but he says men will not do as women do they don't talk they hold everything in and he says well women they might get together and they'll tell about their hurts their pains what they going through but a man be hurting inside you heard his feeling he said d he got to be a man no he hurting no he didn't like what you said and the woman said you know she might sh a little tears and tell let you know that hurt me but a man got to be a man but all the time those things are wounding him and in the inside is and one day it it'll burst burst out and it caused all kind of uh mental battles and he said so many people go through so many sickness and mental battles but they don't talk about it what am I saying value valuing oneself to see what's wrong with you do you want to know what's wrong with you and see that man he had millions and millions of dollars but he wanted to find out what's wrong with me you see what I'm saying see the money was not answer he want to know what's wrong I know what was wrong though the so the um you know the therapist help him and realize what was wrong with it and I I think we got a way of having therapy telling us what's wrong with us and I know he it could soothe him and help him out for a little while but utterly he that that demon would defeat him sooner or later and I don't know that one day because of him being the genius like he is one one day he might find himself committing suicide because when you think you got the answer you only got a solution that's going to last for a little while but the thing is he need Jesus you know I wish I could get to him but he's so intelligent to what I'm saying you know God hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same so you see the need of God and often times the answer is Jesus well who wants the answer amen amen go ahead the answer to your situation is Jesus amen but sometimes it's so difficult to get to Jesus when we got so many things that we're looking at and so many fears and so many you you know can I trust God can I believe that God can fix me that God can help me can I believe it am I able to receive help from God Amen God I need help yes Lord can you help me I believe he's more than able to help [Music] you can you be bor are you for sale they used to get the slaves from Africa sell them for this much sell them for that much how valuable would you be what what would be your price are you for sale Shake somebody hand and ask them how you for sale Judas sold Jesus for what 12 pieces you know how how valuable Jesus was to him Jesus was worth what 30 pieces of silk you understand and sometime the devil will give you something something that you would think that's more valuable than your soul a lot of times you heard very rapidly I mean lately concerning those movie stars and everybody that's out there in Hollywood and all the successful people that in order to be successful you got to sell your soul and uh most people didn't believe that I remember way back I met a a a brother that was running for his life because he had left hwood and everything and he was telling me he said I'm running for my life he was very you know he looked like a movie star very hon young man and he said I I I found out what's out there and he start tell telling me about the different movie stars and all and he told me about their conditions and he said he's got to try to hide because they'll killing and that was way back now and I didn't see him but that one time I never seen him again but he was T and and and you run into people in life that's a price you pay it's a price you pay if you don't serve the Lord It's Gonna cost you amen it's a price you paying if you don't want God Amen you know they'll take a man you know you have to be big like Caleb probably go for a good price back in the day Gerald you go for half the price you a little smaller you know what I'm saying and they'll say you you know what I'm saying but here we are Amen in this hour thinking that slavery is gone and if you see the Book of Revelation it said in slaves and The Souls of men when it talks about you know those the Antichrist and the spirit that would take place in in Babylon and so forth and at the end of the road so we we're headed down that road that this great deception The Souls of men and slavery could be returning to the world but where will you be if we reap what we sow where would you be if this thing reoccur and people don't know it right now that there's spiritual slavery and people are spiritually bound with chains of Darkness yes sir but they don't know it because the devil is very accepted amen and he deceive Eve and so he's deceiving this world deception is in the making now and people are being deceived and you know I'm going to tell you you got folk that do anything and live any kind of way and they got more God than I can ever get so holy to they make me look like I'm a devil you said what if you listen to them talk you feel like you like that not small but you see how they live you say huh look how they live you can't out preach them you can't out sing them you can't out shout them are you with me you can't out talk about the law a testify but you can live you can live a life that will condemn them in the end that's true amen the life you live will be a testimony you better not open your mouth cuz they ain't going to let you open your mouth because all you got to do all you got to do is say something like Micaiah they the the Jeremiah be quiet Jeremiah put him in the dungon they told Mah Michael we don't want to hear him see the people of this day as it was back then they want to hear what they want to hear and they want to live like they want to live and they want to tell you that I got God yes sir and you know many people are following their pricious ways people are being overcome because they think because they're more charismatic and seem to be more annoy those people seem to be more powerful those people seem to be amen got it all together and we talk about simply be holy as I'm holy and living a holy life they look like uh they make living a holy life as something H out of another world it is because it's to kingdom of God Amen he said my kingdom is not of this world is't that right now you may look like somebody from another world your life might exemplify that you are a pilgrim and a stranger brother Jo passing through this one am knowing that this world is not your home amen I'm on my way to Canan land yes I am go God has a place prepared for me and I'm not going to S here and accept this world has been my home I'm just a stranger traveling through this whole world are you with me amen some people I told them last night the demons in hell they're [Applause] saying they want I want that was I want the soul here H and then they said then another demon said I want it and all the devils are fighting over your soul now which one going to get you then those demons they decided when the prophets they said who going to deceive he have for for us he said the the demon said well I I'll be a lying spirit in the mouth of All His prophets God said you got permission go ahead are you with me so the demon that's after your soul you amen must amen let those demons into your life because God give you the ability to said no thank you devil because he said have you considered my servant what CH and you must amen have integrity about yourself that I got I I'm a person of Integrity I'm not going to bow down I'm not going to lie I'm not going to I'm not going to fall for your deception I'm going take a stand because you are a a women of Standards amen you are man of standard amen and we take a stand for something somebody that I said has done something for me hallelujah thank God I can't be bought because I've already been bought with the price I've been purchased with this Blood you can't buy me devil I've already been bought Hallelujah and I'm not for sale Hallelujah glory to Jesus I'm the purchase of his blood amen you might not think enough about yourself but God thought about you amen amen he thought about you and he sheded his blood for you amen he gave his life for you are you with me aren't you glad that he died for you that he gave his life for you amen amen praise God showed you I love you I value you I care about you I love you thank you I wonder who believes that report that Lord You Love Me praise God I love him back Hallelujah why should i s around and hold my head down I ought to be happy amen because I'm a Child of God amen you're Sons and Daughters of God and he loves me so Hallelujah now think the the devil want you to believe that you got to accept amen what he's saying to you to keep your mind's all bed down your life's miserable but you got to tell the devil I'm not going to accept your misery I accept that I'm free hey I heard the juile trumpet I heard him say Amen whom the son is set free is free indeed the juvilee trumpet has sounded and I heard him said amen hallelujah the gospel trumpet sounded one day amen and told me God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son amen that whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life I'm glad I accepted the call one day amen I'm glad I heard the voice one day that I could be happy amen I'm going tell you if you're not happy something wrong amen amen but what makes you happy amen because of what he did for you amen when I think about the goodness of Jesus Amen and all my soul hallelujah thank God for what if he hadn't saved you then that's because you hadn't accepted amen the only way amen you he said God so now it doesn't matter how sinful you are or sin you sinful you were God so Lov you even when we were yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly when we were enemies in our mind by Wicked Works yet he came down and he cared enough B he valued you he said I love you in spite of what you done and how you live I still love you I still I'm still going to die for you amen I he gave his life for us amen will you accept what he did amen are you going to sit around say Amen well I just don't see how things are going to get any better because I hear you talking but it ain't registering right now I'm going to tell this demons and these Devils to get out of the way amen this is what the gospel sword is all about we're not going to allow those Devils to stand in the way of the Gospel amen amen amen you got to condition your heart and mind say Lord I'm going to let you in amen amen God I know you know what's best for me yes Lord God I want you to have your way and have your say in my life I need you now I need your spirit I need your power God I need you now Jesus Hallelujah yes Lord I wonder can he help you Jesus how valuable are you how valuable are your soul is your soul in uh 1 Peter 1 and8 I'm just going to close because I was supposed to preach tonight but I decid to go ahead on on run on Amen the Lord is good amen amen for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as what silver and gold people so busy trying to make money amen corruptable thing to siling go what good is he going to do this corruptible amen people got more of this and more of that only what you do with for Christ will what last last as I say over and over when the question is ask you what did you do with the life when God asked you what did what did you do with the life that I gave you amen what did you do with it then you're going to say well don't be speechless did you give him a penny worth a nickel or dime how much you know what what value what what would you say a quarter 50 Cent the woman she gave one penny but that was all she had just a pen but she put in more than all the rest of them did she amen see God want your all amen are you with me but if he said okay he said at the end he's going to pay every man according to his what I'm me tell you something some of y'all supervisors you look at the book hey how many hours you put in how many time you miss man and you come to Payday smile on your face what you smiling about this ain't enough to pay your rent and you all happy how how much how many hours you be you see what I'm saying pay every man according to his what works isn't that right how much you think you going to get paid huh you going to pay every man according to his what you with me amen look at somebody he looking at me pay every man according to his work ask somebody how much you think you ought to get paid do you think you should get paid how much you think you ought to get paid now if you put in 40 hours and put in uh uh extra hours you want to get double ain't that right but if you give God this little bit a little of nothing with no effort no this you know when people come to work and they work faithfully and they you know sometime the bosss will look at them and say I'm going to give you a what I'm G give you a raise I'mma give you a raise because amen you a valuable employee but they look at the one in Mr day over here Mr day over there come when the morning and when he get there you got to go to the bathroom sit in that bathroom every day I got a what I got stomach problem H yeah yeah you got stomach oh you going every day you come in here well ain't St my head hurting you know so your work you're lazy you you lazy and you want payday come you want to be first one up there get in the chain but the man looking at the book when it's time to lay somebody off when it's lay off time and things ain't going so good who going to be the first one to get laid off are you with me the one that ain't doing nothing amen just R the paycheck are you with me so when it comes down to God uh somebody said the Lord God will do no right he going to do right I know he'll do nothing but reveal but he going to do right this time God going to do right amen he ain't going to do he ain't going to do you wrong if anybody going to do you right God going to do you right ain't that right yes sir he going to do you right whatever right he said I will pay am every man according to his work praise God aren't you you ready to work are you ready to just go oh I don't know what you come to do amen but we here to praise God Amen we're in this earth to give God the glory the praise for all his benefits towards us amen David said if I had 10,000 tongues I praise him with everyone amen don't you see God knows our every move every every of every condition you won't be able because the prophet said you come on the camera and he'll be you you'll be on display just like a movie and it'll play back rap before you and you going to say well God that ain't me said That's you and you know what he discerned the thoughts and the tents of your heart he knew where your heart was right then and you won't be able to get away from God and tell him no your heart will be on display what's down in your heart will be on display that's why we said Lord search my heart and try my rain if you find anything that shouldn't be take it out I Want to Be Right amen so the value your soul is valuable to God but how do you what do you think about it what do you think about your own soul is it valuable do you care about your own Eternal Destiny do you care whether or not you go to heaven or whether do you go to hell do you care whether or not you're Sav or whether or not your loss do you care about your self are you concerned about your soul I hope before you can be concerned you got to be convinced and then you can be concerned amen are you with me God bless you let us stand for as much as you know you were not redeem with corruptible thing to Silver and Gold from your vain conversation but with the precious blood of Christ his blood is precious I'mma tell you that was the most valuable [Music] blood no other blood could do it took the blood of God his blood that was sheded for you and I he care the question that was asked by the Ser God's servant do you care let us bow father [Music] those words were said by your servant he cares but do you care and I asked the question tonight do you care do you care how God looks at you today do you understand he cares about you and he loves you enough to shed his blood and die and give his life for you are you willing in return say Lord I'll live for you I give you my life because I thank you for what you done don't you know eternal life is available now is our heads to bound hearts are looking to him would you give him your life that he can give you eternal life would you like to make a prayed for eternal
