[27:36] when you got it say amen
[27:39] amen and verse 32 that's what we started
[27:43] first samuel chapter 17 verse 32.
[27:48] and david said to saul
[27:50] let no man heart fail because of him
[27:53] thy servant will go and fight with this
[27:55] philistine
[27:57] and saul said to david thou are not able
[27:59] to go against this philistine to fight
[28:02] with him for thou a butter youth
[28:04] and he a man of war from his youth
[28:08] and david said unto saul thy servant
[28:10] kept his father sheep
[28:12] and there came a lion in a bear and took
[28:15] a lamb out of the flock and i went out
[28:17] after him and smote him and delivered it
[28:20] out of his mouth and when he arose
[28:23] against me i caught him by his beard and
[28:25] smote him and salute him
[28:28] thy servant slew both the lion and the
[28:30] bear and this uncircumcised philistine
[28:33] shall be one of them
[28:35] seeing he hath defied the armies of the
[28:37] living god
[28:39] david said moreover the lord that
[28:41] delivered me out of the paw of the lion
[28:43] and out of the paw of the bear he would
[28:46] deliver me out of the hand of this
[28:48] philistine and saul said unto david go
[28:52] and the lord be with thee
[28:54] amen god had a blessing to the reason
[28:56] that's where you may be seeing amen
[29:00] amen i'd like to speak on a small topic
[29:04] of a willing vessel
[29:07] a willing vessel
[29:08] if you read in the scripture here you
[29:10] see how david he came this he had went
[29:12] to the story before the if you read
[29:15] before in the chapter he went to go see
[29:17] his brothers davis went to go see his
[29:19] brothers they were in the camp of saul
[29:21] and the philistines have brought
[29:24] their most most valuable weapon in
[29:26] goliath fourth and goliath challenged
[29:28] the army of the of the israel
[29:31] and said if y'all can bring one person
[29:33] to defeat me
[29:34] then we'll all we all surrender and come
[29:36] to your side
[29:38] and david and no one everyone was afraid
[29:41] because july
[29:42] goliath was a giant
[29:44] he was so many feet high and he he was a
[29:48] soldier from his youth that saul said
[29:50] here and he said and david came to bring
[29:53] food to his brothers his dad sent him
[29:55] and he said and he said i'll fight him
[29:58] and saul looked at him and said you
[30:00] can't fight him he's been training since
[30:01] he was a youth
[30:03] and david said well
[30:05] i fought the lion and i fought the bear
[30:08] and i got victory over both of them
[30:10] and and saul said go forth the lord be
[30:13] with you and david at this point in time
[30:16] david had some things that he had
[30:19] victory over he had some victories some
[30:22] small things that the lord had brought
[30:24] him through
[30:25] and
[30:26] and stepped forward and he said i'm
[30:28] willing to go
[30:29] i'm willing to fight because i know that
[30:31] the lord is with me i know that the
[30:33] things that god has brought me through
[30:35] is going to carry forward and the things
[30:37] that he's going to do for me so i'm not
[30:39] afraid because he was a willing vessel
[30:41] he said lord you send me i'll go
[30:44] lord use me i'll go because i know that
[30:46] what you brought me through is just
[30:48] showing me what you can do it's just
[30:50] showing me what you're able to do and
[30:52] where you're able to take me it doesn't
[30:54] take much it just takes one person being
[30:57] a willing vessel
[30:59] it just takes one person saying lord use
[31:01] me send me i'll go and god can do
[31:04] exploits he can do mighty wondrous works
[31:07] um you look through history and you see
[31:10] um seymour he was on azusa street and he
[31:12] was praying lord send a revival he
[31:15] wanted a revival he he got down and he
[31:17] he dedicated his life to a move of god
[31:21] he dedicated his life
[31:23] and he became that willing vessel and it
[31:25] started a movement called the azusa
[31:27] street revival where it and it caught
[31:30] fire and it touched so many people and
[31:32] he was able to see the effects of one
[31:35] man's dedication
[31:37] one man has taken the time out to get
[31:39] close to god one man saying that this is
[31:42] not enough i need to do more
[31:44] this is not enough i need to do more i
[31:46] need to pray more i need to seek his
[31:48] face more and that's all he did he
[31:51] became that willing vessel he became the
[31:53] one that he said lord use me
[31:56] lord send me and i'll go and lord and i
[31:59] just taken a small step taking something
[32:02] very small
[32:03] but god can do something so great with
[32:05] it god can take the smallest of vessels
[32:08] and say that's the one i'm going to use
[32:11] like they like you look at david david
[32:13] had many other brothers
[32:15] that were taller and statue that were
[32:17] bigger stronger and samuel when he went
[32:19] to
[32:21] the lord since samuel down to david's
[32:23] father's house to anoint him king
[32:26] he brought all his sons sons before him
[32:28] except for david and everyone that
[32:30] passed before samuel was like i know
[32:32] that's the one i know that's the one and
[32:34] the lord said no
[32:36] the lord said no the lord said no and
[32:38] then they even forgot david was out in
[32:41] the field tending the sheep they forgot
[32:43] he was out there but after all samuel
[32:45] said is there any you have any more sons
[32:48] and they say yeah you got the one out
[32:50] there in the field 10 in the sheep and
[32:52] samuel said call for him and bring him
[32:54] forward and he brought him forward in
[32:56] the and samuel anointed him to be the
[32:58] king it was the one that no one thought
[33:00] was going to be the one to be successful
[33:03] no one thought that he was going to be
[33:05] king he didn't look like the king he
[33:07] didn't act like the king but he was the
[33:09] one that god wanted he was the one that
[33:11] was going to shine the light for and
[33:13] lead the people forward in the victory
[33:15] it wasn't everyone it wasn't the one
[33:17] that everyone was looking forward to and
[33:19] saying that's the one or that looks like
[33:21] the one but it was the one that god had
[33:24] pre-ordained and said that's the that's
[33:26] my chosen vessel that's the one that's
[33:29] the one that's going to be a willing
[33:30] vessel that's going to take heed to my
[33:33] to my word and take heed to what i want
[33:35] him to do and he's going to listen and
[33:38] he's going to follow and a willing
[33:40] vessel tonight amen you see in the bible
[33:42] you look at the story of esther
[33:44] now through the story of esther you see
[33:46] how god was preparing her to be the to
[33:49] for the role that she was going to play
[33:52] he was preparing her since he was a
[33:54] child he could have chose any other
[33:56] person to be esther but he chose that
[33:58] one person who uncle's name was motorcyc
[34:02] he could have chose any other young lady
[34:04] to do to do that work but he chose
[34:07] esther it wasn't someone that everyone
[34:09] else would have said that's the one
[34:11] that's the one right there but god said
[34:13] this is the one that's going to listen
[34:15] and heed and be a willing vessel to me
[34:17] and do what i want her to do and to show
[34:20] forth that it doesn't take the biggest
[34:22] strongest person it just takes the one
[34:25] that's that's able to be willing
[34:27] to
[34:28] to lean to his understanding not my
[34:30] understanding
[34:32] to lean to what he wants me to do not
[34:34] what i want to do lord i just want to
[34:37] sacrifice and give you back to you what
[34:40] what you gave to me you look at even
[34:42] jesus
[34:44] which was god's son on earth
[34:46] and you look at how he
[34:49] came and he said lord if this cup can
[34:51] pass
[34:52] then let it pass
[34:54] but at the end of the day he became a
[34:56] willing vessel and he said not my will
[34:58] be done but that will be done
[35:00] and said lord i just want to be a
[35:02] willing vessel
[35:03] something that you can use something
[35:05] that's empty
[35:08] when god
[35:09] he said you can't fill up a cup that's
[35:11] already got water in it
[35:13] you got to have an empty cup to put to
[35:16] fill it up totally up so what you want
[35:19] to be an empty vessel a willing and an
[35:21] empty vessel
[35:23] says sometimes it takes small steps
[35:26] jesus just wants you to take small steps
[35:29] and he can he can reach you and pull you
[35:31] the rest of the way
[35:32] he he can take a small sacrifice that
[35:35] you give and he can make that a great
[35:37] thing because he can magnify it and
[35:40] glorify it
[35:41] i said when you take a small step with
[35:43] jesus he'll take you further than you
[35:45] ever thought you could go
[35:47] when you take a small step with jesus
[35:50] he'll take you further than you ever
[35:51] thought you could go
[35:53] so just giving your life to him even
[35:56] though it may seem small can be
[35:58] something that proves to be something
[36:00] great
[36:01] it can move you across and put you in
[36:03] position in places that you never
[36:05] thought you could have been you never
[36:07] thought you would have been but god
[36:09] god is able to do exceedingly abundantly
[36:12] all that we ask or think so just taking
[36:15] a small thing and god able to multiply
[36:18] and magnify it you never know who god is
[36:21] going to use to be there it could be one
[36:24] one of the children it could be one of
[36:26] us that said lord i want to be a willing
[36:27] vessel it don't take the grown folks to
[36:30] to be the one to lead god can use
[36:33] whoever he wants to use so you're not
[36:36] too small too young or too great or too
[36:38] high that god can't use you
[36:41] god always uses those that are willing
[36:43] that are able
[36:45] say
[36:46] taking that small step with jesus can
[36:48] leave you can take you further than you
[36:49] all ever thought you could go
[36:52] and sometimes
[36:54] we we look at problems and we want the
[36:57] solution without going through the
[36:58] process
[37:00] we want this answer to the problem
[37:02] without going through the process
[37:05] we we want to take the problem and say
[37:07] and just shortcut it and get me to the
[37:09] answer but not realizing that if we
[37:12] would go through the process god will be
[37:14] building us and creating us and using us
[37:17] and washing out and cleaning out that
[37:19] vessel so it can be used he can take the
[37:22] steps the many steps that we thought
[37:25] that we could skip
[37:26] but god said no you need to go through
[37:28] this to make you who who he wants us to
[37:31] be so that he can use us so everything
[37:34] that you go through is just a testament
[37:36] of what god can bring you through
[37:39] everything that you experience is just a
[37:41] testament of what god can do for you
[37:44] everything that you
[37:45] you experience everything that every
[37:47] trial and tribulation it's just proof of
[37:50] how much more god can do for you so if
[37:53] he done it for you yesterday don't think
[37:55] that he gonna mistake and not do it for
[37:57] you tomorrow because he's so good and so
[37:59] gracious he said i'm the same yesterday
[38:02] today and forever and i change not so if
[38:05] he's that god he can always fill up the
[38:08] vessel again and say
[38:09] to his to his glory and say i'm going to
[38:12] use this vessel because now you're clean
[38:15] now you done sacrificed it now yet i've
[38:17] been through some things so you
[38:18] understand the vessel might have some
[38:20] cracks and god said i'm gonna mold it
[38:22] and
[38:23] and
[38:24] clean up the broken pieces and i'm gonna
[38:26] put it back together a willing vessel
[38:29] even if it's broken and shattered when
[38:32] you got the master potter that can
[38:34] reshape and remold and can bring it all
[38:37] together again and say
[38:38] lord i know that i'm done broken and i'm
[38:41] messed up and i got cracks and i got
[38:44] different things that is happening but
[38:46] you can reshape me you can re-mold me
[38:48] into something for you to use something
[38:51] for you to you to take forward and hold
[38:54] in lording and use to your glory so it
[38:56] doesn't always take the most beautiful
[38:58] thing it's the one the most beautiful
[39:01] things most time is the thing that
[39:02] always sits on the shelf
[39:04] and you never use
[39:06] it's the thing that you go in the house
[39:08] and you see it's worn and you said
[39:10] that's that's a cup that's been used
[39:11] right there
[39:13] many people that's the one that got some
[39:14] vents and some bruises yeah they use
[39:16] that must be their favorite one because
[39:18] you can tell how it looks and then
[39:20] there's one sitting up in the glass
[39:22] thing that you never touch
[39:24] it looks so beautiful
[39:26] when sometimes god you does the same
[39:28] thing he says i don't necessarily need
[39:30] the perfect
[39:32] what i need is someone to work with
[39:34] he said i don't need the perfect i need
[39:36] someone to work with so that you and and
[39:39] it's he wants you to give that sacrifice
[39:42] and say lord i'm willing
[39:45] lord i'm willing and i'm able to be
[39:47] to use lord i surrender so that i can be
[39:51] willing lord i i come for forgiveness so
[39:54] that i can be willing lord i sacrifice
[39:57] so that i can't be willing
[39:59] for you to use me the broken pieces you
[40:01] can put them back together and make them
[40:03] what you want
[40:05] and
[40:06] just
[40:07] and sometimes if you cheat the process
[40:10] you'll pay for it later
[40:13] if you cheat the process you'll pay for
[40:15] it later and sometimes we don't
[40:17] understand that oh i'm just getting by
[40:19] here
[40:20] or i'm just going to skate by here and
[40:22] it's going to be all right i got time i
[40:24] got time i i'll fix it later but what
[40:28] you're not understanding is that you
[40:30] miss your foundation
[40:32] you missing the foundation and whatever
[40:34] you skipping now all you're gonna do is
[40:37] build on it later
[40:38] and when you're building on it you can
[40:40] have you can have the most beautiful
[40:42] building in a faulty foundation and that
[40:44] builds in the fall
[40:45] you can have the most pretty thing that
[40:47] you sitting on top of it but if the
[40:49] foundation isn't stable and firm
[40:52] it will fall that's why you want to be
[40:54] anchored in jesus you want your
[40:56] foundation to be in the word of god your
[40:59] foundation to be in prayer to be in
[41:01] studying and getting closer to god
[41:03] because that won't fail that foundation
[41:06] won't ever shake it's a it's a solid
[41:08] rock it's standing there when the water
[41:10] comes and the winds blow it'll stand
[41:13] stable it'll stand firm a willing vessel
[41:16] that's sitting on top of the rock of
[41:17] jesus
[41:18] they're standing there and says
[41:20] and you're sitting there and saying lord
[41:23] keep me
[41:24] lord keep me i'm a i'm a vessel and i
[41:27] got my cracks and bruises but lord keep
[41:30] me reshape me remold me lord keep me
[41:34] lord in the shadow of your wings lord
[41:36] keep me lord i i want to commit to you
[41:39] and give to you you said what abind on
[41:42] earth your mind in heaven and you're
[41:44] able to keep me you're able to keep this
[41:47] will and vessel even though it's empty
[41:49] you will fill it up
[41:50] you'll fill it up with lord your
[41:52] anointing your power and your holy ghost
[41:55] it said it only takes small steps
[41:58] he only asked for two things he said
[42:00] repent and be baptized every one of you
[42:02] in the name of jesus and
[42:04] for the remission of your sin and you
[42:06] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[42:08] god don't ask for a lot
[42:10] he don't ask for a lot he just asks for
[42:13] small things
[42:14] because he knows that if you do those
[42:16] small things they'll turn into something
[42:19] greater
[42:20] if you do those small things it'll turn
[42:23] your life around
[42:25] it'll stop you from going to hell it'll
[42:27] stop you from going
[42:29] doing things that you never thought that
[42:31] i would do
[42:33] but if you don't if you don't choose the
[42:34] right steps
[42:36] you'll fall
[42:37] if you don't choose the right path
[42:39] you're going to fall
[42:40] because you're cheating the process
[42:42] you're cheating what you're going
[42:44] through and you and you're willingly
[42:47] doing things
[42:49] that god don't god don't want you to do
[42:53] but god he always works in the small
[42:55] things
[42:56] he always worked in the small things
[42:58] it's not always the big show
[43:00] it's not always even the jews missed him
[43:02] because they thought he was going to
[43:03] come as a king
[43:05] and he came as a babe
[43:07] he came as something so small and
[43:08] something so ordinary
[43:10] that
[43:12] most people's like that can't be god
[43:14] that can't be god he overheating he
[43:17] eaten just like me and you he riding the
[43:19] donkey and he doing things just like me
[43:21] and you
[43:22] but
[43:23] but they said
[43:24] even some of the pharisees and sadducees
[43:27] recognized and said like nicodemus
[43:29] the things that you do can only be god
[43:32] the works that you do can only be god
[43:35] because jesus was a willing vessel that
[43:37] god used
[43:39] he was a willing vessel that came to
[43:41] earth and god used him and he would he
[43:43] was god created but god used him
[43:47] and
[43:48] all it takes is you being a willing
[43:50] vessel
[43:51] all it takes is you saying lord
[43:53] i surrender and give it all to you
[43:56] and if you truly give it to him i know
[43:59] god will keep you
[44:00] i know he will keep you because he's
[44:02] faithful
[44:03] and that he that he who is faithful in
[44:05] that which is least is faithful also and
[44:08] much
[44:09] all it takes is a little
[44:11] for god to do uh great things
[44:14] all it takes is small amount for you to
[44:16] for god to do great things you just look
[44:19] at an apple seed
[44:21] and you plant that you may not see the
[44:23] fruits
[44:24] for years and years to come but that
[44:26] don't mean it's not coming
[44:28] that don't mean that that seed that was
[44:30] planted a long time ago won't come to
[44:32] fruition and you you reap the harvest
[44:36] and so it all it takes is a small thing
[44:39] to produce something great
[44:40] all it takes is one person life to
[44:42] produce something great it only takes
[44:45] one person getting dedicated to produce
[44:47] a revival only takes one person getting
[44:50] down and and being faithful in prayer
[44:52] that god can move in the midst
[44:54] only takes one person to be praying for
[44:56] your brother to stop something from
[44:58] happening to you
[44:59] it only takes one person standing in the
[45:01] gap for you to keep that hedge of
[45:03] protection of god around your life
[45:06] all it takes is one small thing
[45:08] and someone being a willing vessel and
[45:10] say lord use me
[45:13] lord send me and i'll go
[45:15] amen
[45:18] [Applause]
[45:32] i appreciate the word tonight hey man
[45:34] let's get a lot of hand clapping praise
[45:38] hey man i will investigate man
[45:40] you know i was
[45:42] thinking about some things
[45:44] you know as my brother caleb was
[45:45] speaking i know uh this week
[45:48] you know lord was dealing with me on
[45:49] some things but i was just
[45:51] saying like i to myself i had a
[45:54] moses moment you know
[45:56] how god when he came to moses and he
[45:58] told him imma send you down
[46:01] moses thing was
[46:03] lord who am i
[46:05] that you should send me
[46:07] because he looks at himself and
[46:09] maybe his age and
[46:10] all his failures in his life and
[46:13] all his insufficiencies
[46:15] so i said this week i had a moses moment
[46:18] because i look at sometimes you know get
[46:21] up in the morning
[46:22] and your day planned out from the time
[46:24] you get up to the time you lay down at
[46:26] night you got one thing after another
[46:28] and then i said lord you know our desire
[46:31] of our heart
[46:32] and that is to just be close to you
[46:35] sometimes you want to just go away and
[46:38] and just be by yourself and just get
[46:40] that that time with the lord but you
[46:42] know just through the the times that we
[46:45] live in
[46:46] sometimes it's hard to do that
[46:48] because we in in time just moving so
[46:51] fast as they say we're experiencing that
[46:54] and you know next thing you know it's
[46:56] going on and on and on but then i was
[46:58] saying to myself i said lord you know
[47:00] looking at all your insufficiencies when
[47:03] i began to say lord even
[47:04] when it come down to the ministry it's
[47:06] many that more
[47:09] adequate whatever or can
[47:11] do things even their lives
[47:14] look to be more
[47:15] sufficient as mine
[47:17] more than mine sometimes you go into
[47:19] that place i was thinking of that way
[47:22] but then the lord
[47:23] began dealing with my heart
[47:25] and just showing me its levels of grace
[47:28] that god gave us
[47:31] and i thank god for that because i said
[47:34] that what it is
[47:35] that's i don't know about you but that's
[47:37] how i'm living right now i'm living on
[47:39] the grace of god
[47:40] because i believe that
[47:42] god knows the heart of a man
[47:45] and he knows what's in that man heart
[47:47] some that he might not let get by but
[47:49] some not saying you you you fall in and
[47:52] all that way but it's levels of grace
[47:54] that god give you
[47:56] so i was thinking about that tonight as
[47:58] brother kayla was talking about a
[48:00] willing vessel and i says that's what it
[48:02] is
[48:03] god god don't need your strength come on
[48:07] god don't need
[48:08] your money
[48:10] he don't need y'all like he told moses
[48:12] moses said i can't speak he said but who
[48:14] made the man's mouth
[48:16] moses had all kind of excuses but what
[48:18] god wanted him to see was moses this
[48:21] ain't you anyway
[48:23] he said but i've come down
[48:25] all i need is just a vessel
[48:28] to go down come on and once the lord can
[48:30] let us see that that we can get away
[48:33] from ourselves and what we think we've
[48:35] achieved because remember we can't do
[48:37] nothing without god anyway
[48:39] all that we have in a moment you know
[48:41] tomorrow it could be gone couldn't it
[48:44] i was thinking as was saying last week
[48:46] how short life is life is so short but
[48:49] so tomorrow can be something totally
[48:51] different
[48:52] i've seen some uh boys at work you know
[48:55] picking at this other guy because of uh
[48:57] because of a
[48:59] sickness that he had a illness that he
[49:01] has he has tourette's
[49:03] but
[49:04] and i i got grieved sometimes because i
[49:06] says you know that could be you tomorrow
[49:09] come on
[49:10] that could be your children
[49:12] i says we only live and by the grace of
[49:14] god whether you know it or not
[49:17] come on
[49:18] whether you know it or not
[49:20] we only living about the grace that god
[49:22] allowed us
[49:23] we only able to press our way through
[49:26] to be able to praise god by the grace
[49:28] that god has given you
[49:29] you know we've been going on this this
[49:31] embark embarking upon this month of you
[49:34] know consecration and things and you
[49:36] know sometimes
[49:37] you know you look at those days and you
[49:39] say man it's going to be kind of hard
[49:41] but nevertheless
[49:43] supernatural things be happening
[49:45] i'm a witness to that i was telling my
[49:47] wife last week a couple days i went the
[49:49] whole day but what it is it was the lord
[49:52] that done those things
[49:54] time you know go on and on and on but i
[49:56] said it's what it is we look at our
[49:58] insufficiencies don't we
[50:00] sometimes
[50:01] but
[50:02] it's it's levels of grace that god that
[50:06] god
[50:06] gives us
[50:08] and then that you know a lot of times i
[50:10] like how the scripture says that the
[50:11] weakness of god is stronger than men
[50:14] come on
[50:16] the foolishness of god is what wiser
[50:18] than men
[50:19] and i i i believe that with all of my
[50:21] heart i says what it is when you see
[50:23] yourself as being insufficient or the
[50:26] insufficiencies don't you know that's
[50:28] where god that's what god can work with
[50:31] i was thinking about gideon and how he
[50:34] was hiding from his enemies
[50:36] in in wine press and all that and then
[50:39] when the angel come to him the
[50:41] salutation was getting that mighty man
[50:43] of valor
[50:45] didn't he
[50:46] he says i could see gideon may be
[50:48] looking at himself saying how you say
[50:50] i'm a mighty man of valor yet we hide
[50:52] them from our enemies
[50:53] but
[50:54] what it was god knew what was in him
[50:57] god knew that pushed in the corner what
[51:00] what he what can what he would bring out
[51:02] of him
[51:03] you know something that was in my heart
[51:04] i said you know
[51:06] uh a tree can only bear the life that's
[51:09] in that tree
[51:11] and the fruit that come out of it not
[51:12] necessarily makes it good or bad
[51:15] but it just identifies what what's in
[51:17] that tree come on so we can say apple
[51:20] orange whatever but
[51:22] the tree is going to be known by the
[51:23] fruit it bears
[51:25] so the life that we produce we don't it
[51:28] only bear witness i mean the fruits that
[51:30] we produce in our life is only bear
[51:32] witness of the life that's in you
[51:35] so a lot of times we can claim certain
[51:37] things but what's going to come out of
[51:39] you is what the life that's in you if
[51:41] the life of christ is in there then it's
[51:43] going to come out
[51:44] in the time when you pushed in the
[51:45] corner somebody said i just didn't come
[51:48] on but in the time when that life
[51:49] appears it's only going to appear what
[51:51] was in you
[51:53] you believe that tonight
[51:55] but i say is that what it is you know
[51:57] that's why god knows what's in you
[52:00] and that's why it gets us to certain
[52:02] places pushes in certain trials and
[52:05] tribulations in our lives because he
[52:07] know what's in us we don't know what's
[52:09] in us sometimes i believe the bible says
[52:12] i know it's just paraphrasing the heart
[52:14] deceitful wicked and no man can know it
[52:16] come on
[52:17] god know what's in there but he gets you
[52:20] to that place sometimes and he allows
[52:22] you to see what's in there you see
[52:24] yourself as being weak but then you find
[52:27] out that hey you was a little stronger
[52:29] than you thought you was
[52:31] but what it was it wasn't you but god
[52:32] planted that in you
[52:34] come on he says greater is he that is in
[52:36] you
[52:37] now that might be a sin until you come
[52:39] to that time of your trial
[52:41] till you come to that time of your
[52:43] persecution things happen then you see
[52:46] what something takes over and rise up
[52:48] then you find strength that you didn't
[52:49] know you had come on and i said god
[52:52] that's what it is
[52:53] we want to learn
[52:55] i believe that as individuals how to
[52:57] yield to god
[52:59] how to let god have his way in our life
[53:02] now even though i was praying tonight i
[53:04] was thinking about that little song lord
[53:06] i give you my heart
[53:08] and i give you my soul
[53:10] come on
[53:12] i live for you alone know what the song
[53:14] says and that's what it is we don't just
[53:17] give god just our natural all these
[53:19] things which those things you know
[53:21] that's what men do
[53:23] to brag and look out all those things
[53:26] but when a man giving his heart and soul
[53:29] to god maybe nobody don't see him
[53:31] praying come on nobody don't see him
[53:34] doing those little things that nobody
[53:36] else don't want to do
[53:38] but god see it
[53:39] because that man is sold out to god
[53:42] everything to be done ain't done on the
[53:44] mountaintop but i say where are you in
[53:46] the secret place
[53:49] because in the secret place the prophet
[53:51] god talked about those in the dark ages
[53:53] and how they made it through he said he
[53:55] says because they had secret lives
[53:58] hidden alive their lives was they had
[54:00] the hidden lives what made them strong
[54:03] to make it through all that persecution
[54:05] because of those hidden lives
[54:07] and that's what it is what's going to
[54:08] get us through today come on we're
[54:11] living in a world
[54:12] dark
[54:14] dark world
[54:16] and the world you know the world hates
[54:18] you
[54:19] if it loves you then remember the world
[54:21] of its own
[54:23] but they hate you come on the devil want
[54:26] to do anything he can do to do what
[54:29] destroy your life destroy your soul i
[54:31] told someone before i says you know
[54:33] sometimes when you're dealing i'll say
[54:36] it like this even with natural family
[54:38] they may love you like that feel your
[54:40] love but you have to be careful
[54:42] sometimes
[54:43] because of spirits
[54:44] come on to do what drag you on the other
[54:47] side
[54:48] but what it is you and i
[54:50] uh those gates
[54:52] we'll minister on that sunday by the
[54:54] lord's will
[54:55] but those gates come on you got to let

[55:42] thought that was good because i was
[55:44] thinking on that way one day this week i
[55:46] said look at all your insufficiencies in
[55:49] all reality sometimes
[55:51] you say lord
[55:53] is it somebody else
[55:54] that you that you want to raise up come
[55:57] on
[55:57] in your heart
[55:59] because you said lord there's many that
[56:00] could do a way better job
[56:02] than i can
[56:04] but the lord sometimes what it is it
[56:07] ain't your choosing
[56:09] it's god's choosing
[56:10] and i just said lord whatever you want
[56:13] just let me be faithful

[56:43] of the iowa

[56:47] it's always pointing us back to the
[56:49] bible
[56:51] back to the bible
[56:52] you're always putting the emphasis on
[56:55] the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:57] the more you read and study
[57:00] the message of the hour you can see the
[57:02] emphasis put on the word of god stay
[57:05] with the word
[57:06] stay with the bible
[57:09] the bible the bible the bible the word
[57:12] of god

[57:22] the bible
[57:24] because that's the word that's god

[59:51] it's a blow
[59:52] and i began to

[1:00:13] your good and they work together for my
[1:00:15] good
[1:00:16] and i thank god that while being in
[1:00:18] prison you know
[1:00:19] eight nine ten hours a day reading the
[1:00:21] bible
[1:00:22] and one thing i said to god when he when
[1:00:24] i gave my life to him i said
[1:00:26] if you're teaching me your bible i'll
[1:00:27] teach you people
[1:00:28] for the first year and a half i never
[1:00:30] went out to wreck
[1:00:31] read even when they cut the lights out
[1:00:33] i'd be on the i'd be down on the float
[1:00:35] like this trying to
[1:00:37] read
[1:00:39] and uh
[1:00:40] i was very diligent
[1:00:42] and after that year and a half i went
[1:00:43] out on the yard and started ministering
[1:00:45] the word
[1:00:46] every prison i went to i just started
[1:00:47] ministering the word and everybody knew
[1:00:49] me as a preacher and most of these
[1:00:51] institutions from
[1:00:52] uh broad river
[1:00:54] uh to uh
[1:00:56] libra evans uh lee county at lee county
[1:01:00] i was in b1148 chesterfield north you
[1:01:03] know
[1:01:04] i was in a dorm where everything was
[1:01:05] locked down real rough
[1:01:07] and and i used to work in the cafeteria
[1:01:09] everything and i'd come back from
[1:01:10] cafeteria i used to feed the men
[1:01:12] top tier in the dark bottom tier because
[1:01:14] i bring food back at nine o'clock you
[1:01:16] know
[1:01:16] so i thank god for the wilderness i
[1:01:19] thank god amen for
[1:01:21] when you when you think that you can't
[1:01:23] do your your dependency or your
[1:01:26] sufficiency is is on god and you look to
[1:01:28] him and that's what i thank god for i
[1:01:30] thank god for the man of god amen he is
[1:01:33] truly a man of god a god man after god's
[1:01:36] own heart it feeds the house of god here
[1:01:40] with
[1:01:41] knowledge and with understanding
[1:01:43] jeremiah 3 15 so i thank god for the
[1:01:45] word willingness you know
[1:01:47] because the bible says if we be willing
[1:01:50] isaiah 1 19 if we be willing and
[1:01:52] obedient be the good land so i thank god
[1:01:54] thank god for what you shared man of god
[1:01:57] you know uh
[1:01:58] brokenness
[1:02:01] the bible says a broken and contrite
[1:02:03] spirit he won't despise psalm 51 so i
[1:02:05] thank god for that there you know thank
[1:02:08] god for the young people though it may
[1:02:11] be small
[1:02:12] that's what gideon
[1:02:14] god said you got too many it was 3 000.
[1:02:17] it went down to 2 700 and god only used
[1:02:19] 300.
[1:02:20] you know god will take out not enough
[1:02:23] and make it more than enough god bless
[1:02:25] you
[1:02:29] praise god
[1:02:33] time is short
[1:02:35] and we got to pray more than we ever
[1:02:37] prayed before
[1:02:39] i'm talking about if you're missing out
[1:02:40] on prayer
[1:02:42] brother and sister you can't make this
[1:02:44] journey
[1:02:46] you're going to be left right behind and
[1:02:49] people that you love people that you
[1:02:51] should have
[1:02:52] stood in the gap for your family members
[1:02:55] your children
[1:02:56] people that you you said you cared about
[1:03:00] but you didn't pray you you didn't spend
[1:03:03] that needed time in prayer
[1:03:06] the needed time that's why
[1:03:08] amen god is trying to call us to a book
[1:03:11] seem like we don't want to do that for
[1:03:13] but i believe god is calling us back to
[1:03:15] prayer
[1:03:16] practice seeking his face
[1:03:19] back to standing in the gap
[1:03:21] somebody just signed and crying because
[1:03:23] of the abomination done in the city
[1:03:26] if we're going to help our families
[1:03:27] you're going to help the people you love
[1:03:30] you're going to have to stand in the gap
[1:03:31] you're going to have to start crying
[1:03:33] like to god you're going to have to
[1:03:35] spend time
[1:03:36] praying and calling on god
[1:03:39] you know sometimes you're just walking
[1:03:41] working it's jesus lord heaven
[1:03:44] sometimes people get heavy on your heart
[1:03:46] you got to start praying amen
[1:03:50] and you can't wait till somebody said
[1:03:52] pray for me you got to pray right then
[1:03:54] you just say let me pray for you brother
[1:03:57] let me pray for you sister
[1:03:58] somebody said
[1:04:01] tell somebody to pray tell a preacher to
[1:04:03] pray for me he said i'm gonna pray for
[1:04:05] you amen when i see the preacher i'll
[1:04:06] tell him i'm gonna pray for you now
[1:04:09] are you with me
[1:04:11] and let's get to praying
[1:04:13] i'll tell you when you get to praying
[1:04:14] you're going to see the results you're
[1:04:16] going to see great results through
[1:04:18] fasting and through prayer you see great
[1:04:20] results
[1:04:22] amen and you look for great results in
[1:04:25] the things that you wouldn't
[1:04:28] begging god and asking god to do watch
[1:04:30] god begin to just do those things and
[1:04:33] you say oh if i knew a long time ago see
[1:04:36] we wasted a lot of time
[1:04:38] if i knew a long time ago then i would
[1:04:41] have spent this time because i've been
[1:04:43] talking and witnessing and doing this
[1:04:46] and doing that but if i only would have
[1:04:48] prayed then i would have known what to
[1:04:50] say
[1:04:50] and i would have known how to witness
[1:04:53] because but when i spent the time in
[1:04:56] praying
[1:04:57] god began to move
[1:04:59] brother and sister that's what we want
[1:05:02] to spend time crying out to god and
[1:05:05] telling god you know because he knows
[1:05:07] amen you'll find yourself saying things
[1:05:10] and when you say things that you know
[1:05:11] you ain't saying
[1:05:13] and you remember those things you know
[1:05:15] sometimes i'm on my knees and i start
[1:05:17] writing
[1:05:18] why because i'm saying things that i
[1:05:21] know i ain't saying
[1:05:23] so i take the notes you need to start
[1:05:25] taking notes
[1:05:26] and you because sometimes god be
[1:05:28] prophesied and telling you things that
[1:05:31] succumb
[1:05:32] and you'll find out that god is dealing
[1:05:34] with you god is speaking to you
[1:05:37] and you might tell somebody what you
[1:05:39] know when i was praying this came up
[1:05:42] this person came up call them up
[1:05:45] and
[1:05:46] and see how they doing
[1:05:49] and see what god and then you begin to
[1:05:51] flow in the supernatural beginning to
[1:05:53] flow in the spirit of the lord god began
[1:05:55] to speak to needs god began to show you
[1:05:58] what to do the problem that you're
[1:06:00] having on the job god began to resolve
[1:06:02] those problems and show you how to fix
[1:06:04] things show you how to do things
[1:06:07] god began to do that in the prayer
[1:06:10] he said oh god things begin to flow
[1:06:13] your enemies become your footstool
[1:06:16] things begin to move amen i mean those
[1:06:18] demon powers amen sometimes amen daniel
[1:06:22] was praying for 21 days amen but the
[1:06:25] angel was delayed amen he said god heard
[1:06:28] him when he first started but he had a
[1:06:30] delay amen but daniel amen i heard you

[1:12:44] and god's in my glory will i not give to
[1:12:47] another
[1:12:48] amen because i am a jealous god
[1:12:50] and god is so jealous so uh brother and
[1:12:53] sister amen it seemed like god is taking
[1:12:56] your places and doing things for you you
[1:12:58] got to know you got to stay out of the
[1:13:00] way
[1:13:01] you got to stay humble and stay out the
[1:13:03] way because if you if god is doing those
[1:13:06] things and you get in the way you're
[1:13:08] getting all the glory
[1:13:10] so it'll be like them you know what i
[1:13:12] was reading the prophet saying
[1:13:14] and it's it's the bible too but it was
[1:13:17] it's just something that i was just
[1:13:18] looking at he said now
[1:13:21] and this is this is being said again
[1:13:24] those that come in that day said lord
[1:13:26] then i prophesied in my your name then i
[1:13:28] cast out devils then i do many wonderful
[1:13:31] works he's gonna say depart from me your
[1:13:33] work was of iniquity and i don't know
[1:13:35] i didn't know you
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:38] never knew you
[1:13:40] amen
[1:13:42] why because why because you got all the
[1:13:45] glory for those things
[1:13:48] everything you you didn't give god the
[1:13:50] glory
[1:13:51] you wanted the glory you know and god
[1:13:54] can look down at our hearts and he can
[1:13:56] see everything
[1:13:58] and then it's the one that
[1:14:00] you know when god is using somebody
[1:14:03] see like god was using
[1:14:05] jesus was being used by god he wasn't he
[1:14:09] wasn't doing nothing of himself but you
[1:14:11] didn't know they wanted to kill him
[1:14:13] because
[1:14:14] they were jealous of him and they wanted
[1:14:16] to kill him
[1:14:18] you know
[1:14:19] and that's you know sometimes
[1:14:21] they are accusing the spirit of god
[1:14:25] it's something brother carry on saying
[1:14:27] today he said
[1:14:29] you got to be careful how you talk
[1:14:31] against about the holy ghost
[1:14:34] he said you got to be careful when you
[1:14:35] talk about pentecost and pentecost that
[1:14:38] because he said you got to be careful
[1:14:41] because you can be blaspheming the holy
[1:14:43] ghost
[1:14:44] and you know because god can be moving
[1:14:48] and people's unrecognized they they
[1:14:50] think it's a oh ah that ain't nothing
[1:14:53] amen you
[1:14:55] don't be careful
[1:14:57] because
[1:14:58] there's a lot of people thought they had
[1:15:01] a revelation who god was
[1:15:03] and those are the people and the prophet
[1:15:05] god said they'll be the people that
[1:15:07] gonna persecute the saints just like
[1:15:09] they did of old the jews killed jesus he
[1:15:13] said watch in the end time he said watch
[1:15:16] them do the same thing he said the
[1:15:18] denominations would do the same thing to
[1:15:20] the bride
[1:15:22] i'm not talking about people say they're
[1:15:23] in this message but i'm talking about
[1:15:25] some people have a denomination of
[1:15:27] spirit and think they you know the bride
[1:15:30] and they'll kill you and they think
[1:15:32] they're doing god service
[1:15:34] are you with me
[1:15:36] praise god
[1:15:37] so i'm saying to you
[1:15:39] watch these spirits in the last days
[1:15:42] when god is moving in a supernatural way
[1:15:46] it'll be a spirit they're going to come
[1:15:48] against you
[1:15:50] and it'll say that's the devil
[1:15:53] that's what the jews said they called
[1:15:55] invisible they called him the devil but
[1:15:57] god was doing things
[1:16:00] you know especially when it's a when
[1:16:02] it's a when it's a powerful move of god
[1:16:05] people look at it you're going to have
[1:16:07] to see what side of the fence you're
[1:16:08] going to be on when god is moving
[1:16:11] if he's moving with you it is a spirit
[1:16:14] of jealousy i don't know
[1:16:16] you know because he ain't moving with
[1:16:18] you
[1:16:19] but he'd be moving with the little ones
[1:16:22] somebody small insignificant with god
[1:16:25] moving in their life and vindicating it
[1:16:28] amen
[1:16:29] their ministry and their lives
[1:16:36] don't talk about somebody
[1:16:38] pray for them and say lord
[1:16:41] i
[1:16:41] thank you just going about your business
[1:16:43] if you don't know just go head on
[1:16:46] well they're not in the message
[1:16:48] leave them alone
[1:16:49] go ahead home
[1:16:51] just pray for your brother break i mean
[1:16:53] pray
[1:16:54] and make sure
[1:16:55] that you're doing what god called you to
[1:16:57] do
[1:16:58] because some things you won't understand
[1:17:01] and i'm saying be very careful because
