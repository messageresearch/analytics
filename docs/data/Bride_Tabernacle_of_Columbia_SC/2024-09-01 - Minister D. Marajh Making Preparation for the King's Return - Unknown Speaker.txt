have your Bibles you could open it to the Book of Ezekiel chapter 8 just a few verses there from verse 17 Ezekiel 8 17 and then we'll go across to chapter 9 as well amen verse 17 says then he said unto me hast thou seen this oh son of man is is it a liting to the house of Judah that they commit the Abominations with which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch to their nose therefore will I also deal in my Fury my eyes shall not spare neither will I have pity and though they cry in my with a loud voice yet will I not hear them and chapter 9 verse1 he cried also in my ears with a loud voice he says cause them that have the charge over the city to come near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which Li to WS the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's inkhorn by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen Altar and the glory of the Lord glory of the god of Israel was gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed it with the linen which had the writer's ink horn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon their foreheads set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go ye after through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity slay utterly young and old both maids and little children and women but come not [Applause] near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house amen let's bow our heads for word a prayer Heavenly Father Lord we worship you this morning oh God we give

amen may be seated this morning again I I thank brother Simmons for the invitation we praise the Lord Jesus amen the Lord said go through the city and put a mark upon their foreheads those that cry and sigh for the Abominations that done in the city and we know that that Mark that he went for to put that Mark was the Holy Ghost that we have today and without the Mark everybody else going to be destroyed without the Holy Ghost the the destroying angels are waiting on the sidelines they just waiting on the word go forth and Destroy where are you this morning I want you to examine yourself as we go through the service where are you today has the angel put a mark on your forehead are you filled with the Holy Ghost this morning are you just a church member church member is going to be destroyed do you sigh and do you cry for the wickedness that's been done in the world today when we see what's happening in the world are is our heart grieved we saying oh God come and have mercy Lord amen how long Lord Jesus how long would it go on Lord do you cry out for that or do you take pleasure in the things that goes on in the world today he's looking for those that's crying and that's sighing that's sick of it at their stomach at what's happening and and know that we are living in the time of the coming of the Lord am his coming is any day now amen and there is still some to get that Mark on their foreheads and remember that Mark is the Holy Ghost and how do you get the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost Peter told them repent repent turn away from your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen and he will wash away your sins and fill you with the Holy Ghost he will put the mark upon you when you repent and be baptized in his name amen the number one thing is to repent am is to turn away from the sin turn away from the world turn away from the life you've been living amen and get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen some people are baptized but they still haven't turned away amen their heart is still in the world but God wants you he's looking for those that is sick of it now is tired of the world today amen and those that will have the mark on their foreheads on the doors of their hearts amen amen amen blessed be the Lord he is still marking today amen and the destroying angels are waiting on the sidelines they are waiting it wouldn't be far again it wouldn't be much days left till God will say go ahead and destroy man and woman boy and girl no pity just destroy spiritual debt amen hallelujah don't you thank God for his grace this morning oh what a wonderful savior we have that he has given us a heart to believe and to receive it amen that's grace of God the grace is to everyone but not everyone accepts the grace amen people want to do something to to say they are worthy of that Grace you cannot do anything to be to worthy of that it's God's grace to you mean you don't have to do anything but accept it amen that's what God's love is for you yes amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus amen my subject today if for I call it this is making preparations for the Return of the King amen making preparations you know if I might deviate from that a little bit when the president of America wants to visit a foreign country or maybe a the king of England or the pope or somebody you know before the actual date that he goes by he sends a delegation months before to make preparation to prepare for his visit to that place everything has to be right everything has to be in place amen the delegation from this country will go and find the local people in charge because they are the ones will oversee the preparations the delegation will tell them how they want it and what needs to be done but the locals are the ones to have it to oversee it the preparation of it and the King of Kings is coming back amen we are waiting on his coming amen any day now the King of Kings will come through the sky and we will be caught up to meet him amen but all now I believe that preparation is being made for that coming amen angels from Heaven are here Among Us making preparations for the coming of the king amen amen when he came the first time Angel went to Zacharias to make preparations for the first coming amen told Zacharias your wife will have a son and he will be the prophet of the most high he will prepare the way for for the King of Kings amen he went to me the angel went Mary and prepared you shall conceive and bear a son amen amen to let Mary know that when she sees her stomach getting big she would know that that was an a that was the visit of the Holy Ghost upon her amen amen she had to know amen but the a the delegation from Heaven had to come and tell her what to do am amen even even before Samson was born an angel came to his father and mother amen and told him how to prepare the child amen amen amen is heaven coming together with Earth to prepare for the coming of the king amen and he is coming back amen and preparations have to be made am everything have to be in place for when he comes through the sky amen and the angels are here now preparing with the locals which is you and I those with the mark on their foreheads those with the Holy Ghost amen you are the important ones now on Earth that the angels will come to to get ready for the coming of the king amen because it's you the king is coming to it's not coming to the world out there no sir he's coming he's looking for those with the mark amen amen with the Holy Ghost amen and when he takes those with the Holy Ghost the rest will be destroyed I just want to point out something in the scripture that I read in the last verse amen he said start in the sanctuary he's telling the destroying angels He says start in the sanctuary that's the church that's where you're going to that's where the Abominations are being done Amen in the churches of today amen forget the the denominations out there forget the world the Abomination in the church he say start there amen and Destroy and he say start with the Elders of the church they are the ones that encourage the Abomination that I hate amen amen destroy them all but don't touch none that has the mark on their foreheads am amen none with the Holy Ghost amen there may not be any significant person it might be a little person person in the corner that sits down that never says amen but their hearts are filled with the Holy Ghost they they cry day and night oh God when are you coming Lord this is getting worse lord I can't take it no more that's the person that's going to be marked amen hallelujah angels are among us today we don't see them because we don't think about them angels are in this church this morning if our eyes could be open we'll see them amen an angel is standing with me on the pulpit right now when brother Simmons is preaching here and angels with him all the time amen I believe that amen amen I preach in Africa and a brother saw the angel standing with me brother who sees Visions they are they are walking among us all the time sometimes we feel a a a strange atmosphere when we go to thinking about the Lord and when we go to reading the word and and seeking the Lord face we will feel an atmosphere come around amen we sometimes we say oh it's the presence of the Lord I believe that yes but God sends his angels to be with us angels are walking with us all the time the angel of the Lord encamp it around those that fear Him amen all the time amen not some of the time amen they en camp that means they set up camp when you set up camp you're not going you staying amen and the angel of the Lord stays with you who fear the Lord amen they've set up their Camp there amen Hallelujah but sometimes you know we look at our brothers and sisters and we just look down on them sometimes we we we we argue with them and we we treat them badly you know what if you could see the angel standing next to your brother how would you speak to them how would you treat them but they have an angel standing with them at all times all times it's time we we we take note of that the angels are preparing they are coming by to give us Revelation if you would say to give us understanding amen that's why they are here because the time will come when our eyes will be open am we our minds will be quickened amen our spirit will be stirred up Amen to get ready for that coming amen because there are promises in the Bible yet for us that needs to be fulfilled amen amen there's coming a manifestation of the sons of God the power of God is coming back in the church but we have to be ready for it amen and the angels are here getting us ready and we don't see them we may not recognize them the prophet says when we get to thinking on the Lord he appears amen Angels appears amen we are living in the time now we will see Angels appear Among Us amen amen but they are coming only for a certain certain group of people I am looking for them I am looking for angels to appear amen the closer we get to the coming of the lord we will see them amen we may see them walking Among Us amen we may not recognize them but there will be angels from the the kingdom of God down here among us to prepare for the coming of the Lord they don't know when he's coming but they have to prepare we have to prepare because we are the locals amen that the Angels a Heavenly delegation will contact us get ready prepare your hearts amen prepare your minds am put away the world now all that will pass away be ready for the coming of the Lord the king is coming amen he's coming to the sky any day now get ready amen run for your life amen amen amen run for your life amen those who who who are just church members or if you never been saved amen I I admonish you today don't leave the church today until you you find out how could I be saved how could I receive this seal that's Mark in my forehead the holy ghost in my hearten the Bible says repent amen repent turn away from your sin and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah do you believe in angels today am amen people don't see it and they don't feel it because they don't believe in it and some people that their lives they live the Angels wouldn't come around such a life amen it wouldn't come around we have to live a life that God will say this is my son amen I am pleased in him amen amen this is my daughter I am well pleased amen amen hallelujah amen let's let's shift our Focus today let's shift our Focus God is coming back he's looking for people who would surrender who would cry and sigh for the Abomination that's done in the church amen they're tired of it am the preachers they only care about money now they only care about numbers in the churches they don't care about the word of God and the people the Holy Ghost they will make a little compromise here and there to satisfy your friends amen because they pay more tights than others that's all look for now now with YouTube and all the the social media they want to be famous out there and they forget the main thing they're not crying out for the Abomination they are the ones that's causing the Abominations in the churches that's right the elders and when the angel go to m put the mark they chase the angel away don't come by me I don't want that Holy ghostess I want my friends amen the Lord Jesus is sick of it today amen he's sick of the system that we are in amen and we have to be sick of it too amen amen blessed be the Lord Jesus amen amen I'm here to encourage you today amen if you don't have that Holy Ghost that Mark on your head forehead it's a spiritual Mark it's not a literal Mark it's either you take that one or you'll take the mark of the beast when the devil gives it amen amen you got to take a mark someday amen you decide today examine your own life where you standing where are you today amen if the king come tomorrow or if he gives the the word go through and Destroy where which side would you be on once that that word go forth there's no more marking it's too late then for you you canot say oh come now let me get the Holy Ghost no it's too late for you now is the time amen

amen all he is asking is you repent and come to him yes Lord you don't have to pay no money we don't want your money amen God don't want your money amen God wants your heart amen amen and then he will give you everything you have need of we are too busy trying to get money and make a living and working and building a house and doing this and that and we forget the main thing when Jesus said he will give you all of that if you will seek Him First seek Him First and he will give you all of that amen because in any case all of that will pass away amen amen when it's time for he to come for you amen amen amen don't be fooled amen don't be carried away amen the enemy will come to you and tell you that God don't love you that God don't see you because you know you way down in the corner and you're the smallest of them all God saved you amen he saved you amen that means you are not small you are great in the sight of God am you are you are you are so worth you your value is beyond amen amen you
