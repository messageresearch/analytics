[38:44] Thank you, Lord.
[38:46] Amen. All you've done for
[38:49] me. Thank you,
[38:53] Amen.
[38:55] Can we just stand again for the reading
[38:57] of the word? We want to go to Proverbs
[38:59] 31 and 10. I'll just read one verse
[39:04] [Music]
[39:06] there. Proverbs 31 and 10. It says, "Who
[39:11] can find a virtuous woman for her prices
[39:14] fall above rubies?" May God bless the
[39:18] reading of his word. We want to
[39:21] go here to Hebrews
[39:24] 11. And I want to talk to you this
[39:27] morning about women that have a
[39:30] standard. Women of
[39:32] standard. Women of standard. We thank
[39:35] God for all the mothers again. Women
[39:38] that has a standard. Amen. And in that
[39:42] we want to talk a little about a
[39:44] mother's love and and a mother's
[39:47] sacrifice.
[39:49] you know, a mother love and a mother's
[39:55] sacrifice. And uh he says, "Who can find
[40:00] a virtuous woman for her price is far
[40:02] above
[40:04] rubies." So we thank God
[40:06] for a godly mother. Amen. A godly
[40:11] mother. Amen.
[40:13] It's very important, you know, that we
[40:15] give honor to godly women and godly
[40:19] mothers. Amen.
[40:22] So,
[40:23] as the world, as we know in America,
[40:27] we're
[40:28] recognizing Mother's Day. Amen. We take
[40:31] time out to say to the mothers, "Thank
[40:33] you."
[40:36] Say to the wives, "Thank you. Thank you
[40:39] for your sacrifice." Amen. Thank you for
[40:42] all you do.
[40:44] And thank you for all you have done.
[40:47] Amen. Amen.
[40:52] And it's all right to give honor where
[40:55] Aries do. Amen.
[40:58] So by the grace of God, as we look at
[41:00] Hebrews
[41:01] 11, women of standard, women that has
[41:04] took a stand. when the odds are against
[41:08] you. Yet these women stood
[41:11] up. They stood up when the odds were all
[41:14] against
[41:15] you. And that means,
[41:18] Amen. A bishop used to say, he says,
[41:22] "Any dead fish could go with the flow of
[41:24] the stream, but it takes a live fish to
[41:27] go against the current." Amen.
[41:32] So sometimes if if we want to go with
[41:35] the flow, but those that have a
[41:38] standard, amen, you go against the
[41:43] current. In other words, the but if
[41:48] you some folks just go with the way the
[41:52] world turns, go with the flow. But we
[41:56] don't want to go against the flow. We're
[41:57] going against the flow, against the
[42:00] current. We don't want to be conformed
[42:02] to this world. We want to be
[42:05] transformed. Amen. Amen. Praise God.
[42:07] That there's a change in godly women,
[42:10] holy women. Amen. Those those women,
[42:13] Amen. that takes a stand in a such an
[42:17] evil, a dark world.
[42:19] But we were at graduation
[42:21] of of Caleb the other day and my wife
[42:25] was she were looking at the mothers and
[42:28] the grandmothers and maybe the great
[42:30] grandmas and she was
[42:33] saying you know they had on their
[42:35] Shirley Temple. She said she called it
[42:38] early tempered
[42:40] dresses and she said
[42:44] they and she said those old women ought
[42:46] to be shaming
[42:48] themselves mothers, grandmothers and
[42:50] all. She said they ought to be shaming.
[42:52] Look at them. Sometimes I didn't see and
[42:56] the little graduates girls that were
[42:59] graduating. She said and sometimes they
[43:02] had the gowns open and she said if they
[43:06] sat down what they going to sit down. I
[43:09] said oh you know but women that take a
[43:13] standard ought to be
[43:14] honored and you know they says uh uh
[43:19] some that uh do double honor. Amen.
[43:23] So I'm saying women that that take the
[43:26] stand in this, it's
[43:29] difficult because you you're going to be
[43:31] identified as
[43:33] unpopular and you're going to be
[43:36] unpopular. You're going to be
[43:38] criticized,
[43:40] scrutinized, and you're going to go
[43:42] through something if you take a stand.
[43:45] But I believe there was still women that
[43:48] are godly women that take a stand.
[43:50] They're godly. Amen. Amen. and they
[43:52] suffer the reproach. Amen. They have to
[43:55] go through something for the stand that
[43:57] they take for God. Amen. They're going
[44:00] to re be reproached for Christ's sake.
[44:04] And it takes something. It takes a
[44:06] strong It takes a strong uh
[44:10] woman to be able to to
[44:14] withstand the
[44:16] criticism, the ridicule.
[44:20] It takes somebody that's
[44:23] Amen. that's worthy. Amen. To be called
[44:27] the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. We call
[44:31] the lamb's wife. Amen. It takes
[44:34] somebody, Amen. that got enough
[44:37] courage, that's not afraid to stand up.
[44:41] Amen. Amen.
[44:42] I think on last Mother's Day, we talked
[44:44] about Esther that she said, "If I
[44:46] perish, I perish. I'm going to see the
[44:49] king. Amen. She was a woman that took a
[44:52] stand when the odds were against us.
[44:54] Amen.
[44:56] And she had a a a hidden identity
[44:59] because they didn't know that she was a
[45:01] Jew. Are you with me? Amen. Her identity
[45:05] was not exposed.
[45:10] But it it took a time that she had to
[45:13] come forth. Amen. and take a
[45:16] stand even though Amen. It might cost
[45:20] her her life. Amen. But she took a
[45:24] stand. Amen. I need you know those type
[45:28] of women. Amen. Godly women. The women
[45:32] that could uh will take a stand when it
[45:35] might cost you everything. Amen. Amen.
[45:38] Take a stand. Amen. Not only that. Amen.
[45:42] I thought about the the women that when
[45:45] Peter was locked up in
[45:48] jail. Those women that prayed all night.
[45:51] It must was late in the night that the
[45:54] angel came and took the shackles off a
[45:57] pill because we had he had some praying
[46:00] sisters. Amen. Women that knew how to
[46:03] get a prayer too. Amen. Amen. And the
[46:06] angel when he got free, he went right to
[46:09] the house and they were still praying.
[46:12] Amen. And the little dancer answered the
[46:15] door and said, "Uh, Peter's at the
[46:18] door." But they said, "It must be his
[46:20] angel."
[46:22] But Peter was at the door because they
[46:24] were praying. Amen. Amen. Amen. If we
[46:27] pray, things can happen. Amen. God can
[46:30] make a difference. Amen. God can break
[46:33] the circles. Amen. of your loved ones.

[46:45] They don't mind praying. Amen. Till they
[46:48] Amen. the loved ones can be set free.
[46:51] Amen.
[46:53] Somebody grace God. I thought about
[46:56] those type women. When I said women of
[46:59] standard, women that knew how to get a
[47:02] prayer through. Amen. Amen. So many
[47:04] times I heard mama praying. Amen. And
[47:08] and I often times say it hurt me when I
[47:10] was out there in the world of sin. And
[47:14] it hurt me to just hear her pray. Amen.
[47:16] I just didn't want to I I just didn't
[47:19] want it. It was doing something to me
[47:22] because she was praying and I said,
[47:25] "Oh." Oh. Because you know when you're
[47:28] not doing right and somebody praying.
[47:31] Amen. Amen. and they crying out on your
[47:35] behalf. And I said,
[47:37] "Oo." So I said to those mothers that
[47:40] are praying, "Amen. Praise God. Keep on
[47:43] praying." Amen. Amen. God, Amen. Here's
[47:47] your humble cry. Amen. Just keep on
[47:50] praying. Amen. The Lord will make a way.
[47:53] Amen. Somehow. Amen. Just keep on. Don't
[47:57] stop praying. Amen. Cuz God can make the
[48:00] impossible possible. Amen. God can
[48:03] change situations.
[48:06] Amen. Keep on praying. Amen. For surely
[48:11] we don't have to go way back in the
[48:13] Bible days, but there are women now that
[48:15] take a stand that God uses. Amen. And
[48:18] you can be identified. May not be in the
[48:21] New Testament scripture, but you are
[48:23] there. Amen. You're there as one of
[48:26] those women, praying women of the
[48:28] church, those that Amen. know God. Amen.
[48:32] Know that God shall do exploits. Amen.
[48:35] You're one of them. Amen. And you got to
[48:37] identify I'm one of them. It's not only
[48:40] back in the Bible days. It's now in this
[48:43] day that I'm taking a stand. Amen. I'm
[48:46] taking a stand for godliness. I'm taking
[48:49] a stand for holiness.
[48:52] I'm taking a stand that God still lives
[48:55] and he's still real and he's still good.
[48:58] And I don't bother praising him. I don't
[49:00] talk telling the world I love the Lord.
[49:03] Amen. Amen. Women are standing. Amen.
[49:07] Don't mind praising the Lord. Amen.
[49:10] Don't mind testifying. Amen. Of what
[49:12] he's done for me.
[49:15] I thought about the Sunday school this
[49:17] morning. We brought out sister Anna and
[49:20] she said the doctor said I couldn't have
[49:23] a child.
[49:26] and and uh she says Charity is 15 years
[49:30] old. Amen. Amen. Praise God. God is
[49:35] good. Your
[49:37] faith in God. We don't have to go way
[49:40] back there. We know. Amen. What God did
[49:42] for Sarah and Abraham and know what he
[49:45] done for others, but he's doing it now
[49:47] for you and I. Amen. Amen. Praise God.
[49:51] Amen. Praise God. We got a testimony
[49:53] that we can share. Amen. Today. Amen.
[49:57] Amen. Women are
[49:59] standard. Women that are giving God all
[50:02] the glory and thanks for what he's done
[50:04] in our lives. Amen. Amen. In their
[50:08] lives. Excuse
[50:10] me.
[50:11] Here in Hebrews
[50:15] 11, it talks about this certain woman.
[50:19] And I like to uh often times talk about
[50:22] this woman
[50:24] because
[50:26] sometimes, amen, our situation, our
[50:29] condition, folks might would look down
[50:31] on
[50:33] you, might despise you and criticize
[50:37] you. But God took someone that was amen
[50:41] not socially
[50:44] accepted. Amen. not identify with the
[50:47] rest of the
[50:48] crowd. Amen. Somebody that was
[50:52] despised, such as the woman at the well,
[50:55] and he used her. Amen. Amen. I want to
[50:58] say your case is not hopeless. Amen.
[51:02] Amen. Amen. Your situation is not
[51:04] helpless. Amen. But God is still using
[51:08] women a standard. Amen. Amen. Amen. It
[51:12] may not may not look like a woman is
[51:14] standing to the world. Amen. But God in
[51:17] your heart, there's something burning
[51:20] down deep. Amen. That identifies you as
[51:23] a woman, Amen, a faith. Amen. Amen. In
[51:27] Hebrews 11 and30, it says, "By faith the
[51:32] walls of of Jericho fell
[51:37] down." Praise God.
[51:40] And somebody was identified with that
[51:44] happening. Somebody, amen, said, "I was
[51:47] a part of uh uh some woman could say,
[51:51] Amen. that I was there and I can
[51:53] identify." Amen. Praise God. I'll tell
[51:57] you, walls still fall. Amen. Amen.
[52:00] Jericho walls still come down. Amen.
[52:03] Praise God. When the enemy Amen. had you
[52:06] all walled in. Amen. Hallelujah. Walls
[52:10] still fall.
[52:12] Amen. Amen. Praise God. I said walls got
[52:15] to come down. Amen. Amen. Praise God.
[52:18] Walls of misunderstanding. Amen. Walls
[52:21] of criticism got to come down. Amen.
[52:24] Walls of disappointment, walls of
[52:27] jealousy, walls of hatred. Amen. Walls
[52:30] got to come down. Amen. Amen. God still
[52:35] bring down Jericho walls. Amen. But it
[52:38] took a
[52:39] woman of integrity, a woman, a standard,
[52:44] amen, to recognize by faith before the
[52:47] walls came down. Amen. I know. Amen.
[52:51] That your God is real. Amen. She was on
[52:54] the other side supposeding an
[52:57] unbeliever. Somebody that did not know
[53:00] the God of Israel. Amen. Amen. said she
[53:03] had faith that that God was a real God.
[53:07] Amen. Amen. That God is that was a
[53:10] victorious God and I want to be
[53:13] identified with him. Amen. Amen.
[53:17] Amen. Amen. So sometimes even in our
[53:22] condition. Amen. We want to be
[53:24] identified with the living God, the true
[53:27] God that you know is real. Amen.
[53:31] She could have sat back and and said to
[53:35] the spies, "Don't come in my house." But
[53:38] look what happens in the 31st verse. By
[53:41] faith, the what?
[53:45] Now, I wonder why you want to call this
[53:49] woman something like that in the Bible.
[53:51] For that was what she was.
[53:54] But she didn't have to remain what she
[53:57] was. Amen. Amen. Are you with me? Amen.
[54:00] I believe God looked beyond
[54:03] He looked beyond her faults. Amen. He
[54:06] looked beyond Amen. what kind of person
[54:09] the world might think of her. God didn't
[54:11] think that way. Amen. Amen. He didn't
[54:14] call her a holler like that because of
[54:18] what he did in her life. Amen. She
[54:20] became
[54:22] amen. She became somebody Amen. that
[54:26] Amen. took a stand. Amen.
[54:29] stand with the children of God. Amen.
[54:32] Praise God. If Amen. If she would have
[54:35] asked, can I can I be one of y'all? Can
[54:38] I can I uh just join y'all? They might
[54:41] have said no. No, you are not one of
[54:45] us. Amen. You're not a
[54:48] Jew. But God look beyond that.
[54:52] Amen. See, sometimes Amen. Some folk
[54:55] Amen. But this woman, Amen, beyond the
[54:59] criticism,
[55:01] Amen. You know, she said, "If I do this,
[55:06] she will jeopardize
[55:10] jeopardize." She was in
[55:13] jeopardy of being
[55:15] killed. Are you with me? Amen. If they
[55:18] caught her hide, no
[55:22] spies, she could have died.
[55:26] I'm going to tell you
[55:27] something. You must have enough faith in
[55:32] what you believe and who you believe
[55:36] that you go beyond the criticism.
[55:40] You don't
[55:41] think about what they can do to you
[55:46] because you know this God. She She said
[55:48] she didn't see
[55:51] God. She said, "I heard about your God."
[55:54] Amen. I heard about what God dried up
[55:58] the Red Sea. I heard Amen.
[56:03] Praise God. I hope you heard about a God
[56:05] that can deliver. Amen. A God that
[56:09] saves.
[56:10] I heard about him. Amen. Hallelujah.
[56:14] That was enough. She didn't have to say.
[56:16] All she did was her. Amen. Something
[56:19] about her. Amen. That she believed.
[56:22] Amen. She believed what she heard.
[56:26] And she wanted, Amen. to be one of them.
[56:29] Amen.
[56:31] Glory to your name. Thank you, Lord.
[56:33] Thank you, Jesus. So, here
[56:38] Rahab the harlot, perish not. With them
[56:42] that believe. What? Believe
[56:46] not. She wasn't harmed, but she perished
[56:49] not with them that what?
[56:53] See? Amen. Don't be a
[56:59] not. Don't be an unbeliever.
[57:03] She perished not with those that believe
[57:05] not. But she believed. Amen. In spite of
[57:09] who they say she was and what she was.
[57:13] Amen. Yet she believed. Amen. Are you
[57:17] with me? Amen. She believed that God was
[57:20] more than able. Amen. to deliver her.
[57:23] Amen. She received the spies with peace.
[57:29] Are you with me?
[57:32] I wonder, will you receive Jesus Christ
[57:34] with peace? Amen. Amen. Will you receive
[57:37] him into your heart, in your life? Will
[57:40] you receive him with peace? Amen.
[57:44] Are you with me? Amen.
[57:47] And 32. Let me just go ahead on read.

[58:04] prophets, who through faith subdued
[58:07] kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
[58:08] attained the promise, stopped the mouth
[58:12] of lions, quenched the violence of fire,
[58:15] escaped the edge of the sword. Out of
[58:18] what?
[58:19] Out of weakness, we're what? Made
[58:21] strong. We're made strong. Amen. Amen.
[58:26] Watch violent in flight. Turn to flight.

[58:52] her a child and and the child died and
[58:55] Elijah said, "Is it well with thee?" She
[58:58] said, "All all is well. All is well."
[59:01] The child was dead, but she knew that
[59:04] all was well. She made it to the
[59:07] prophet. Amen. That had spoke a word and
[59:10] caused the child to be born. Now, no
[59:12] child is dead. And she knew all was well
[59:16] because she made it there. Amen. Amen.
[59:20] She said, "All is well." Amen. Amen.
[59:24] Amen. And I want you to know all is
[59:26] well. Amen. Amen. Amen. All is well.
[59:29] This woman, Amen, had faith. She's a
[59:31] woman standing. She was a woman that

[1:03:09] marking and of
[1:03:11] scourging. Yay. Moreover, of bonds and
[1:03:17] imprisonment, they were stoned.
[1:03:21] They were swn a son. They were tempted.
[1:03:25] They were slain with a sword. They
[1:03:27] wandered about the sheep skin and goat
[1:03:31] skin being desecuted and afflicted. Of
[1:03:35] whom
[1:03:36] what? The world is what?
[1:03:41] I said the world is not
[1:03:43] worthy. Amen. Amen. They wandered in
[1:03:47] desert and in mountains and in dens and

[1:04:26] evaluate and give you a report card in
[1:04:29] the
[1:04:29] grave, Amen. will you be a woman of
[1:04:33] standard? one that took a stand and
[1:04:37] before a crooked and perverse
[1:04:40] generation, a wicked
[1:04:43] generation, a generation that rejected
[1:04:47] the word of
[1:04:49] God and didn't want the
[1:04:52] word. Will you take that stand? Would
[1:04:55] you be one of them and said,
[1:04:57] "Lord, I'll take a stand for you
[1:05:01] because one day you stood on the cross
[1:05:05] and you didn't come
[1:05:06] down. You would despise the shame."
[1:05:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:12] You know, I thought about the story of
[1:05:15] this young girl that was coming home
[1:05:18] from college on the
[1:05:20] train and uh she looked after the
[1:05:23] wonderful her mother was at the train
[1:05:27] station
[1:05:28] and her
[1:05:32] mom was
[1:05:35] disfigured and she was
[1:05:37] so, you know, wasn't nothing proud to
[1:05:41] look look at and the girls from the
[1:05:44] college that was on the train with the
[1:05:46] young
[1:05:47] lady said, "Oh, who's that ugly lady?"
[1:05:51] In other words, they were saying how bad
[1:05:53] that woman
[1:05:55] looked.
[1:05:58] And the young lady know that was her
[1:06:01] mother and she sat there and she didn't
[1:06:04] say nothing at
[1:06:07] all. She didn't say that's my mother.
[1:06:11] But she was ashamed to let those girls
[1:06:14] that were picking
[1:06:16] at this woman
[1:06:20] that was
[1:06:22] burnt had been through the
[1:06:25] fire and was burnt and her face looked
[1:06:28] all
[1:06:30] marred. There used to be a pretty woman
[1:06:33] but she had been burnt.
[1:06:38] See, the daughter was
[1:06:44] ashamed. The story goes on to
[1:06:49] tell when she got off the
[1:06:51] train, she almost wanted to shine her
[1:06:55] mom because she was ashamed of her
[1:07:00] mom. But the story was
[1:07:03] that the house caught on
[1:07:06] fire and the house caught on
[1:07:09] fire. Mama knew that her baby was in
[1:07:14] there and mama hazard her
[1:07:18] life to go back into that
[1:07:21] fire and get her baby out of there.
[1:07:27] I said the
[1:07:30] sacrifice that mothers
[1:07:32] make a mother's
[1:07:36] love. Mother sacrifice. She
[1:07:40] sacrificed. Now she's the little girl
[1:07:43] looking now all pretty.
[1:07:47] But the
[1:07:50] daughter sometimes folks are ashamed to
[1:07:54] be identified as a
[1:07:56] Christian.
[1:07:59] Shame. Jesus was
[1:08:03] marred. There was no beauty that we
[1:08:05] should desire him. When they crucified
[1:08:07] him, they just whipped him and beat
[1:08:13] him. So much as so they he looked
[1:08:19] defeated. All forsook
[1:08:22] him. But yet he was wounded for our
[1:08:25] transgressions.
[1:08:28] Bruised for our iniquities.
[1:08:31] Yet he died anyhow.
[1:08:34] In spite of how we done,
[1:08:37] we didn't want him.
[1:08:42] I hope you understand what he did for
[1:08:44] you. Amen. He went to hell when you
[1:08:47] should have went there. Amen. He died
[1:08:51] when we should have died. Amen. That we
[1:08:54] might have eternal life. Amen. Are you
[1:08:57] with me? Amen.
[1:09:03] Another
[1:09:04] story about
[1:09:06] a a man hot hunting
[1:09:10] deer and he had made a contraction uh
[1:09:15] and I was down in Louisiana. They had a
[1:09:18] uh some type of instrument duck call and
[1:09:22] they can sound like a duck and it cause
[1:09:25] the ducks to come and and this man had
[1:09:27] something that a type of a gadget that
[1:09:30] he had made to cause the deers to come
[1:09:34] like he's a a a fawn uh that's what you
[1:09:37] call it, brother Gerald? A baby
[1:09:40] deer. And uh he blew it like he was in
[1:09:47] trouble. And here the
[1:09:50] dare mother dear what you call it mother
[1:09:57] a devil. The
[1:10:00] dough
[1:10:03] heard and though it was she come out in
[1:10:07] the open looking for the baby.
[1:10:13] And the infidel man didn't know
[1:10:17] God getting ready to blow the heart out
[1:10:20] of the
[1:10:21] deer couldn't do it from
[1:10:23] it. He saw a mother's
[1:10:27] love that she was willing to lay down
[1:10:30] her
[1:10:33] life for the baby.
[1:10:37] mother's
[1:10:39] love. When
[1:10:42] Solomon had the woman come forward that
[1:10:46] had stole another woman's
[1:10:49] baby and he said, "Let
[1:10:55] me cut the baby in
[1:10:58] half and give you half of it and her
[1:11:01] half of it." The one of the woman that
[1:11:04] has stole the baby. She say, "Well,
[1:11:06] that's all right with me." But a
[1:11:09] mother's love says, "Let her have
[1:11:11] it. Let her have the baby." Because she
[1:11:15] knew that woman had stole her baby.
[1:11:18] So she said, "Let let her let let her
[1:11:21] have it. I rather her have a live baby
[1:11:24] than you to cut the baby in half and
[1:11:26] give me half and her half." Amen. The
[1:11:28] other woman didn't care.
[1:11:31] I'm talking about women of standard.
[1:11:33] Amen. Women that has motherly love.
[1:11:37] Amen. They're willing to Amen. give
[1:11:41] up. They're
[1:11:43] right. And Solomon says, "Huh, that's
[1:11:47] the real mother right there. The one
[1:11:49] that was willing to give that baby up
[1:11:52] before they killed the baby." Are you
[1:11:55] with me? Amen. And I'm going say I'm
[1:11:57] going to tell
[1:11:58] you women
[1:12:00] today, women of
[1:12:03] standard, mothers that made sacrifices
[1:12:06] for
[1:12:07] you. It ought to not just be on Mother's
[1:12:10] Day. Did you say, "Mama, I love you.
[1:12:13] Grandmama, I love you. I appreciate what
[1:12:16] you done for me and what you're doing
[1:12:19] for me."
[1:12:21] If you don't tell them you love them any
[1:12:23] other time, you can tell them today,
[1:12:26] "Mother, I love you." You know those
[1:12:29] words are hard to say for a man.
[1:12:33] Sometimes they don't mind saying it when
[1:12:35] they don't mean
[1:12:39] it. But when they mean it, look like
[1:12:42] they have trouble saying I love you and
[1:12:45] thank you. I tell my wife, "I love you
[1:12:48] and thank you."
[1:12:50] And I look at my children, I
[1:12:53] said, I
[1:12:55] thank my
[1:13:00] wife. Why I thank her? Cuz a lot in the
[1:13:05] midnight
[1:13:07] hour sometime the man is just stay there
[1:13:10] and sleep a little while
[1:13:12] longer. Mama going to what? She heard
[1:13:15] that baby crying. She what? keep getting
[1:13:19] up and seeing about that baby. Now
[1:13:21] sometime they might say you get
[1:13:25] up. But as a
[1:13:28] whole mama making the diapers sometime
[1:13:33] children get big and
[1:13:34] heavy and they want you to hold them.
[1:13:37] And sometime I don't know how mamas can
[1:13:39] uh uh uh take and had the strength cuz
[1:13:42] sometime they be little and the baby
[1:13:44] look like they almost like but they have
[1:13:47] strength to hold on to those babies and
[1:13:49] to carry them when they can't carry
[1:13:52] themselves.
[1:13:54] Mama's love mama that cares that make
[1:13:58] sacrifices. It's a sacrifice that they
[1:14:02] made that you
[1:14:05] here. Think about those not all the time
[1:14:09] the mothers that did not care, did not
[1:14:12] take time to reel you, didn't take time
[1:14:15] to change your diapers and clean you up.
[1:14:19] Amen. I'm talking about the mothers that
[1:14:22] have sacrificed their time, their
[1:14:25] effort, their life for you.
[1:14:28] You can take time out to say, "Thank
[1:14:29] you, Mom. I appreciate
[1:14:32] it."
[1:14:34] Amen. And whatever you can do for a
[1:14:38] mother.
[1:14:40] Amen. If you had a good
[1:14:44] mother, do all that you can do to try to
[1:14:47] make her happy. Do all you can do to try
[1:14:51] to make her happy. Amen. Because one
[1:14:55] day, Amen. Mother won't be
[1:14:58] there. And when mother
[1:15:00] don't ain't no
[1:15:03] replacement for mother when mother's
[1:15:06] gone. So while you have the opportunity
[1:15:09] to do something, let mother know you
[1:15:12] love her and that you appreciate what
[1:15:16] she's
[1:15:17] done. You know, I sat in the
[1:15:20] room when the children were being born.
[1:15:25] I think my wife went out and that line
[1:15:27] went blank on
[1:15:30] Caleb and the doctor said, "Pray, pray,
[1:15:34] pray. Everybody
[1:15:36] pray. I can't lose her now." And the
[1:15:40] blood was just gushing,
[1:15:43] gushing. And they did a Caleb
[1:15:47] Holland, mama gone,
[1:15:50] blank. And God by the grace of God,
[1:15:53] everybody calling on Jesus. The doctor
[1:15:55] calling on Jesus. Everybody in the room
[1:15:57] calling on Jesus said, "Rabb call on
[1:16:02] Jesus." Everybody praying that she come
[1:16:06] back and she came
[1:16:09] back. But with Rachel, everything
[1:16:13] just they said, "Hold it, hold it, hold
[1:16:16] it. Wait till the doctor get I ain't
[1:16:17] can't wait.
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:22] That was fast.
[1:16:24] Quick. Come down to Josh. Nine months
[1:16:28] pass. Lord know about
[1:16:30] that. Nine month pass and he still ain't
[1:16:33] going to come. Still ain't coming. They
[1:16:36] got to some long. It took too long for
[1:16:39] him to
[1:16:42] come. Well, he finally came. But it was
[1:16:45] way late.
[1:16:47] I remember Lord's mama said, "Tell those
[1:16:49] people to take that baby when when Pete
[1:16:52] was born cuz they ain't no it was taking
[1:16:56] too long." But God is good. It's good to
[1:16:59] have mama. Amen. You know, I was seeing
[1:17:03] the little baby
[1:17:05] uh the other day and he was cry. I know
[1:17:09] he was is sleeping, but he kept moving
[1:17:11] and
[1:17:12] squenching. And Renee was taking her
[1:17:16] hand and just rubbing the baby gently
[1:17:18] like that. I said, "What you doing?" She
[1:17:22] said, "I just rub." You see, he he he
[1:17:25] doing a lot of squenching in his sleep.
[1:17:27] And I just rub him like that and that'll
[1:17:30] calm him down. He can go to he can sleep
[1:17:32] well. And that's what
[1:17:34] happened. And I said, "Oh, sit down."
[1:17:38] You know what you doing? You You
[1:17:40] understand? You know now me I'm I'm
[1:17:43] thinking what's she doing? That baby
[1:17:45] sleeping. But she said he's squenching
[1:17:47] and going on. He ain't sleeping well.
[1:17:50] And uh she just rubbed his little
[1:17:52] stomach and he slept well. But I'm
[1:17:55] saying a mother's love. It wasn't her
[1:17:59] baby. It was one of the niece baby. You
[1:18:01] know what I'm saying? And I'm saying
[1:18:04] it's something about a mother. When she
[1:18:05] see a baby, she just can I hold it?
[1:18:09] That's somebody else baby. It ain't
[1:18:10] nothing you. But they just mother love.
[1:18:14] They love babies, you know. They care.
[1:18:17] Amen. They reaching reaching out because
[1:18:20] they care. Amen. That's mother love.
[1:18:24] Praise God. The grandmama can keep them
[1:18:27] for a while. But after a
[1:18:31] while, thank the Lord for you. We love
[1:18:35] you. By the grace of God, God is good.
[1:18:38] Ain't that right? We thank God for
[1:18:41] grandma. We thank God for mother. And I
[1:18:44] I said God bless you again, mothers. And
[1:18:47] thank
[1:18:49] you a godly mother, Christian mother,
[1:18:53] mothers that
[1:18:55] care. I want to say I appreciate you. I
[1:19:01] thank God for you. Just keep on
[1:19:04] praying for us and let's all pray for
[1:19:08] our mothers.
[1:19:10] And I I said hopefully another Mother's
[1:19:13] Day won't go and we not do something
[1:19:16] special for y'all. I'm hoping I was
[1:19:19] talking to a gentleman yesterday. I said
[1:19:22] we should have done something special.
[1:19:24] He said, "Sure enough, my wife is a good
[1:19:27] cook and she going to she can do it. She
[1:19:31] cater." I said, "Okay." I said,
[1:19:33] "Hopefully, we can do something
[1:19:35] special." Amen. Amen. So, by the grace
[1:19:38] of God, I don't want to catch Father's
[1:19:40] Day cuz I didn't catch Mother's Day. So,
[1:19:41] y'all father have to wait and got do the

[1:19:57] Lord's willing. If the Lord don't come,
[1:19:59] we're going to look out. God bless you.
[1:20:01] Let us stand. Amen. Okay,
[1:20:06] I
[1:20:07] know hopefully God will look upon this
[1:20:10] word
[1:20:13] and you heard something that
[1:20:16] would just cause you to see the love of
[1:20:20] God and how he
[1:20:23] cares. If the the the deer could care,
[1:20:29] if that mother could go into that
[1:20:32] fire, how much more that our heavenly
[1:20:35] father loves us
[1:20:39] enough to die on the cross for our
[1:20:42] [Music]
