produce such a cry lord that you hear from heaven god you would help us to be reconciled with you do it lord jesus tonight speak to our hearts thank you lord for we love you in jesus christ's name amen god is good amen tonight by god's grace we want to look at first chronicles first chronicles 17. very familiar [Music] first chronicles 17 and we'll begin at the first verse if you got it say amen and it reads now it came to pass as david sat in the house that david said to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in the house of cedars but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains then nathan said unto david do all that is in thine heart for god is with thee and it came to pass the same night that the lord that the word of the lord came to nathan saying go tell my servant go tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shall not build me a house to dwell in you may be seated just read a little further down he said thou shall not build me a house to dwell in for i have not dwell in a house since the day that i brought up israel until this day but have gone from 10th to 10th and from one tabernacle to another whatsoever i walk with all israel spake i a word to any of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying why have you not built me a house of cedars now therefore thus saith thou for now therefore thus shalt thou say until my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheep coat even from following the sheep and that thou should be a ruler over my people israel and i have been with thee whatsoever thou whatsoever thou has walked and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of great men that are all that are in the earth also i will ordain a place for my people israel will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither shall the children or the wickedness waste them anymore as at the beginning and since the time that i commanded the judges to walk over my people i mean to command the judges to be over my people israel moreover i will subdue all nine enemies furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee in house may god had a blessed arena of his word by god's grace just for a moment and i entitled something i was working with on sunday is god in simplicity and the sub topic the nature of god amen god and simplicity and the nature of god i says you know one thing about the lord god he never changes his mass i mean he always changes his mass but he never changes his nature his characteristics and who he is that makeup won't change he might change you know the the place to where some somewhat that he dwells in or or the mask but he never changes his nature who who god is he'll always be so we find that you know i says you know you can look throughout all the scriptures no matter throughout all the scriptures he was the same you know he was at one point god above us the pillar of fire and he was god with this and you know we know him as god in us today the holy ghost but no matter the dissertation of the nature he's still going to no matter the dispensation or the dwelling place his nature is still going to be the same how many believe that tonight so we find that i says you know it's a lot of characteristics and a lot of things that god has to display or that's attributes that's in him that we say that he wants to display that's why sometimes people say we question god or why certain things happen why god allows a minister once on what god allows we question sometime what god allows but god allows things to transpire sometimes because he's got some things in him that he wants to show you or who he really is you know we can hear a lot of times of who god is and we can rejoice all those things but you know god wants you to know from a personal standpoint of who he is he wants you to have your own testimony how many believe that tonight he wants you to have your your personal testimony your personal relationship always says that you know it's something about it you know people can talk about how i made it over come on i know you don't want to sit around and just listen to somebody else testimony but you want to have your own testimony you want to let you can let them testify but then you want to tell somebody what god has done for you you know i was sharing with a guy at work and we were sitting in office quite a while the other day and we were just talking you know he was telling me his testimony and i was telling him my testimony and i said you know nevertheless sometimes we count uh people out we just look but you don't know what god done for that person and you don't know sometimes that person that you count now they might have a powerful testimony if you would only sit down and listen sometimes and they can tell you sometimes of what god has done for and even though they might have stumbled off of the path somewhere here and there god could use you as a light that they can look back i remember that you know we were at work once and sitting down at the table and i began to uh talk about i said everybody's uh uh uh i says a lot of people have places where they were in life where they made commitments to god and they said god if you get me out of this place i'll never go back oh god if you do this for me god i serve you all the days of my life i said god brought many that way and you know we begin to tell the testimonies and and uh you know one of the ones the testimonies and i shared again or the older guy that was in vietnam he was saying how you know he was over there and as soon as the gun votes passed by he said that the vietnamese jump out of the weeds and just start shooting at them and he says that they was shooting at him so hard he said they ain't even had time to pick up their guns said he was laying so close to the to the ground he started using his fingernails to dig in the ground to try to get lower he said he can hear people all around him getting chewed up by bullets and he started crying old man started crying he says he started saying to himself he says lord if you get me out of where i'm at right now he said lord i serve you all the days of my life and he said all of a sudden when he said that he said he felt something warm come over him and he says then he got the the strength to get up in the midst of all the bullets flying around him get up and and get his arm bear his arms up and begin to take in the fight back to the enemy he didn't get shot not one time and he says now he says now then i said i told him i said i said i want to call his name but i told him i said you know that commitment you made was real wasn't it that was a real commitment and i says even though god already knew that you wasn't going to hold up to your part god was faithful anyhow and many times god know that you when we make those desperate cries that we ain't gonna hold up to our part but i believe that god knows what was in your heart he know that in your heart if you could live right you would live right he know that in your heart and that's why a lot of times he knows hallelujah that you know when when israel made that statement once they said lord we will keep your jaw we'll keep your statue we'll keep and all this god knew they weren't going to be able to keep it so that's why he knew that what it was going to take for the people to keep his statues was that they was going to have to be born again it was going to be more than just having a letter written in front of them or they can read it every day and even post it on their door post on their bed and all those things but god said i'm gonna have to do something i'm gonna have to write it in their hearts come on i'm gonna have to come down he says i'm gonna have to come down and i'm gonna have to get in them and dwell in them and cause them to walk in my statues and i thank god for that tonight that we don't depend on ourselves to live this life we living this life depending on god to do the work hallelujah for god to keep us when you wake up you just say lord i thank you for keeping me last night and i'm looking for you to keep me tomorrow hallelujah god i'm living this life only because of your grace and your mercy how many believe that tonight so that's what it is we stopped trying on our own but we said lord let your spirit come god let the holy ghost come lord and fill me up hallelujah don't just just don't just give me a touch lord but fill me up let my cup run over hallelujah oh jesus how many believe that tonight aren't you glad that god does those things hallelujah i like how once in the scripture he said the battle ain't yours but it's the lord's we ain't fighting our own battles but we're depending on god tonight how many believe that but we find that i says no matter where god is like we say he got certain things he wants to display but nevertheless you know no matter what form he's in no matter where he comes the dwell is nature going to be the same a lot of times people can say certain things are god but you can look at the nature of it come on you can look at what it what is uh displaying and you can tell that it ain't god come on how because it ain't lining up with the word for one so you can a lot of times tell that and what it is god will never deny himself he'll then he'll never deny the word come on if the word is in you then when the word is going forth you're amen the word you're amen the word why because you just you just agreeing with with the life that's in you though it's cutting you amen and why because when you're hearing the word you see in yourself hallelujah the life that's in you is punctuating the word with an amen how many believe that tonight hallelujah so we find that i say as god in simplicity and the nature of god i says you know one thing about it you know one one of the characteristics of god like it says god has a lot of characteristics but one that we want to talk about tonight is is is the humility part we want to talk about the humility part i says a lot of times you know god you know uh he dwells the prophet god said he dwells in humility god dwells in those things you know seeing here in the scripture how you know david he wanted the bill god house he got up they saying you know he was walking out and he was seeing and you know it was in his heart because he was seeing and looking at how much god has blessed him and nevertheless looking at what all god has blessed him he wanted to do something back for god he wanted it was in his heart god look at how much you bless me and look at where you're living it come on out there intense and yet he said it ain't right hallelujah that i can live in these this big this big uh uh palace and all and the lord dwell in tense it was in his heart to do right no matter how much god blessed him he still and it had in his heart something that he wanted to do for god and i say tonight you know a lot of times we lose that stance when god bless us sometimes we have our hands reaching out for more blessings instead of in our hearts saying lord what can i do to uplift the kingdom of god lord what can i do to be a blessing to your children what can i do to bless you lord hallelujah god you bless me what can i do to return the favor hallelujah how many want to return the favor tonight how many want to give god back to him what he gave to them hallelujah i don't know about you but that's what's in my heart i said his heart was right but many times he says you know i like god's reply to david he says he says i want you to go tell david he says that ever since i brought the children of israel out of egypt he said i dwelt from 10 to 10. he said and not one time did i go to the elders and ask them or to the judges and ask them why haven't you built me a house he said not one time have i asked for that come on but he began to show that you know all these things all those things he was showing something or what of where or where he dwelled in you know i like how in one place he says what house will you build me he said heaven heaven is my throne as the earth is my footstool he says haven't my hands made all these things come on you know i believe that i believe he was solemn and said lord the heavens of heavens can't contain thee let alone this house that we built come on but nevertheless god was showing that it ain't in these carnals these big things that he wants to dwell in but he dwells in humility god don't need all of that sometimes but what god wants is a united vessel god just wants a heart that he can dwell in god wants somebody to say lord here i am god send me god i might not have money and i might not be famous in all the earth i might not be nothing lord but what i got lord here here i am lord use me hallelujah and i like that how god told david you know he says you know he says you know where i brought you from come on i'ma show you what i dwell in come on he said i brought you from the sheep coat from fallen sheep hallelujah on the back side of the wilderness but nevertheless he said i took you from that place and i made you uh again made you uh like the great men in all the earth i gave you a name like the great men and all the earth don't nobody knew you knowed you and i was sharing with the guy at work i said the thing about it is one thing about god i said he loved to take up time with the people that the world rejected he loved to take up time with the ones that strung out on drugs the prostitutes the alcoholist god loves to take up time with those people that the world has rejected hallelujah and he'll raise that person up and give them a name like the great names in all the earth he'll take that person and he'll make something out of nothing hallelujah that's one thing to do how many believe that tonight so what it does it makes you start looking back over your life come on it makes you start considering like that says when i consider the heavens the work of thy hands what is a man that thou art mine for him it might make you start looking back the way god brought you from make you start thinking about some of your low points in life and it make you sometimes get tears in your eyes and think about that god bypass some of all the ones that was way better than you come on some that was counted hallelujah some that might have had a better resume than you god bypassed all of them hallelujah and he took you and he gave you a name hallelujah how many thank god for that tonight i said sometimes uh uh you know i was out praying the other day and and the song came to me i was sharing with them i said the song came to me what more can he do come on he don't lay the foundation he don't open up the way what more are you looking for him to do come on god down laid the foundation he don't open the way up he doesn't told you i'll be with you even in you hallelujah until the end of all time didn't he tell you that hallelujah he said i'll never leave you hallelujah nor forsake you i like how he told joshua neither will i fail you hallelujah i don't care how where you at tonight god ain't a failure i don't care where you find yourself in the condition you find your life in god is not a failure hallelujah in the midst of your condition god is still triumphant god is still victorious in the midst of the muck in the mary clay hallelujah oh jesus they're literally gonna find a way to push its way out of the mud hallelujah and sprout i was sharing that that's why i was kind of stirred i was sharing that with the guy at work i said something about you don't know the potential that's in those seeds hallelujah i said but god has the ability to see the potential in it it might just look like a little seed but god see trees coming forth god see fruit thousands and abundance of fruit coming forth out of that little seed i said what it is you got to get it in the right atmosphere you got to get it in the right atmosphere where it can get the right nutrients i don't know about you but i said those little ones sometimes that we just think ain't nothing i said but nevertheless get them in the right atmosphere get them in the atmosphere where the holy ghost is falling where the power of god is coming down and watch the life that comes out of it watch the the fruits that come out of that life hallelujah oh jesus you didn't see it but god saw it hallelujah you didn't see the fruits coming out of your life but god saw it hallelujah and he said i'ma work with it i know what to give it i know how much sunlight it needs i know how much water it need and rain i know what it takes hallelujah to bring out your life the best in you i know what it takes to bring out your life what i can get glory out of hallelujah oh jesus it says the nature of god god dwells and you know just for the sake of time i had to skip i said god one of his characteristics was humility god dwells in those things come on how many believe that tonight it's in humility you know when you think about uh i says that he was clothed in humility you know when you're looking at humility you're talking about to recognize your statue to be little or or of no importance when relation to deity when you look at your statue and you look at who you are and you count yourself as little of no importance in relation to guilty even jesus when he walked the shores he walked the earth he says i can he never bragged on himself he said but i can only do what the father is showing me he says i'm written it's written of me to do thy will come on he said there's none good no not one but god he was always pointing back to god and who he was always pointing back to the father always pointing back to those things not recognizing himself to do nothing but only what he allows that's what i'm capable of and so if the holy spirit is dwelling in you what would it do it would point people back to the father it would give all the glory to god it would always recognize that god it ain't what i can do lord is but it's what you're capable of i ain't worthy know how god but you're worthy you get all the glory out of my life you'll get what you want out of my life lord here it is i give it all to you lord hallelujah how many want to give it all to him tonight pointing people back to the father pointing people to where your help come from i believe david said i know where my help come from come on my help coming from where the lord which made heaven and earth hallelujah oh jesus i said pointing people back to where your help come from your testimony ought to point people back to jesus your life ought to point people back to jesus hallelujah what you displayed out to point people back to jesus and up that lonely road of calvary you know i was saying the other day i said you know it came to my heart i said you know sometimes sometimes people can look at you in your situation and they can say oh they know what you're going through or they or they know what you're dealing with come on but in all reality they don't have a clue come on they don't know the pain that you feel they don't know the hurt you're going through they don't know those lonely nuts that you face with but i says even though you seem like sometimes it seems like nobody knows i said one thing about it he promised i'll never leave you when you think that road is lonely god is there all the time how do you think you keep pressing your way through how you think you keep pushing it fighting another day it ain't by your strength but it's by the strength of the holy ghost it's god teaching you that i want you to lean on me quit trying on your own and give it over to me hallelujah in weakness i'ma show you what real strength is in humility i'm gonna show you what i can do what i dwell in you know i think about moses and how i like how moses he told them he said lord who am i that you should send me come on many people want to go but he said lord who am i hallelujah 80 years old wheat in the flesh come on but nevertheless that's what god dwelt then god said you go down but i'm coming down i'm the one coming down to deliver them i'ma show you hallelujah that in weakness where your strength is gonna come from hallelujah how many believe that tonight but we find that i said god you know that's what it is it's hard sometimes for us to recognize or to or to uh display as being a human that humility that god's looking for now we're not saying to conjure up your own humility because god don't dwell on those things come on like he talked about the pharisees and how when they fast they walk around with sad conscience and all these things to to show off before men come on he says but they have their reward we're not talking about these things come on but god is something about his spirit brings about i believe a presence it brings about you know a nature that comes in and you can't help it but that's what you walk in hallelujah that's the life that's being produced out of you come on we talk about like we said those trees those trees only produce the life that's in it come on the branch is only going to produce the life that's in the vine we know they talk about how they drafted branches and all these things but we know that if that vine would ever put forth another branch it'll produce the life that's in the vine hallelujah and when we look at our lives i said lord the life that's being produced i want it to be your life the life that's being produced aside from the signs and wonders come on but a man a loneliness of heart come on a man that can only do what but give god the glory how many feel like that tonight come on and what it is i said but it's hard sometimes you know it's hard sometimes for a man to to like i said to recognize himself of little or no importance come on it's hard for a man to do that it's hard especially for men like you say to do that to recognize themselves of little oh no importance you know when israel was crying out for a king their whole objective their hole in their mind you know even though god was leading them god was fighting all their battles and god was was blessing them but their whole objective of why they wanted a king you know the bible says they wanted to be like the other nations they wanted to have a man that they can put out in the front and show him off come on and say this is our man this is who fighting all our battles they made they made that statement that he can go out and fight our battles come on to be out in the forefront and all those things and god allowed him to do that but you see what happened when that man he was so caught up in himself that he felt like he can do what he wanted with the word of god he felt like he didn't he can take what he wanted do what he want hallelujah well god rejected him in the end didn't he and i say that even today you know we watch our attitudes we watch the spirit that's on us because one thing about it you can be rejected by men but you don't want to be rejected by god in the end you don't want him to say depart from me you workers of iniquity i'd rather be rejected by my family rejected by my friends and in the end have him say well done thy good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord hallelujah you walk that lonely walk you walk that that walk that was lonely hallelujah men in this theme you're great nobody sometimes even recognize you but nevertheless you were willing to walk that walk how many are willing to walk that walk tonight i said god you know what it is that says he doesn't need a man that's head and shoulders but what he needed what he needs is a yielded vessel come on a yielded vessel i asked the question are you willing tonight to be that yielded vessel are you willing that night i mean tonight to take the back seat sometime come on are you willing to get down to your knees and pray when nobody else is sin are you willing to go the distance hallelujah that's what god dwells in you know i have some things i want to share but for the sake of time we won't be able to share them but i said there's one thing about it you know god dwells in humility he dwells and that's those things the humbleness of heart sometimes we got to watch our speech you know i want to go to some things we got to watch our speech you know your speech and the things you say can take the presence of god out your life can rob the presence of god from you the things you know of god could have poured out more things but he didn't why because your speech destroyed your speech killed it come on all right they say your speech betrayed you but god is good god watches over tonight amen praise the lord amen we appreciate the word tonight amen god is good amen and he watches over us amen i was i had wrote down at the beginning of his message rejected and how do we deal with rejection and so i i told caleb i just showed him and brother ernest at the end of his message he started talking about re reject rejection and i was saying how do we deal with rejection the bible said he was despised and rejected a men a man of sorrow and acquainted with greed you know many times those that are godly they are the oddballs they are the rejected of this society if you want men to receive you i was just studying the great men of the old of the gospel and like mueller and um sturgeon and different ones and those they can grow to thousands thousands coming to to their ministry then they face the time of rejection if you're going to stand you're really going to stand for the word if you're really going to stand strong for the word then they had to deal with rejection people began to the newspapers and everything began to talk about them criticize them it was hard difficult in their lives to deal with rejection and sometimes sometimes you can go into some dark places when we're being rejected almost into depression when we're rejected when you're talked about so i looked at those men and i said those that live godly in christ jesus every one of us we have to face and know how to deal with rejection because that's what we should come to know what it feels like to be rejected because our captain of our salvation jesus dealt with rejection david though he was one that was hailed you know david has killed his ten thousands and so forth and everybody looked up to david david david one day he had to deal with absalom and being rejected brother and sister if we going to get anywhere in christ if though christ blessed us exceedingly and abundantly with all his blessings then there come a time when god event you're gonna feel what it felt like to be rejected no matter how you try to stand for god there's to be an enemy that's going to take you through your time of rejection the time when you'll be despised and when you deal with it properly god will restore you after all your rejection god would bring you amen back to the throne as he did david and those men that had to go through their time of rejection ridicule persecution but they spilled on the word and if you we're expected to stand on the word then we're gonna have to know that we're gonna be rejected and people gonna look at you as being odd and different they want you to give in to the world the world is giving in in the religious world amen even you know you might say message believers or whatever they're giving in if you don't come and follow the crowd then you're going to deal with rejection sturgeon he had to deal with the baptists or whatever because he's still true to the word and neighborhood become loose and liberal but he stood strong with the word so yeah he had to leave he had to get out of it and i'm saying brother and sister sometimes when you're dealing with rejection amen but he held to that word he held to that word he held to his conviction and he held truth didn't worry about all the popularity didn't give in brother and sister that's what we got to do others might want to get loose and get free and don't stand on the word no more you got to hold to the word you got to hold true to god's word are you with me thank god for brother ernest thank god for the word today amen remember your commitment is not to man your commitment is to christ you love him amen and stay committed to god and to his word amen god bless you let us there father in jesus name lord you said all the live godly in christ jesus yourself for persecution father help this little body of believers those oh god recognize the real time of rejection we won't be popular we won't be men pleasers so the crowd would not but it's going to be a straight as your servant said today it's a straight and narrow way it's straight and narrow it won't be the broad way but it's straight and narrow lord you're saying again at the straight gate father help us to enter in at the straight gate father is the lonely way but must jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free certainly there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me lord help us to carry this cross each and every one of us take of our cross and follow him will you do it brother will you do it sister will you take up your cross the bible said it was joy that was set before him he endured the cross oh brother
