[19:11] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen they
[19:19] will want to thank God for just watching
[19:23] over each and every one of us keeping us
[19:26] under the blood want to talk tonight
[19:29] about Hebrews 11 chapter the created
[19:33] power of the word we just try to talk to
[19:39] you a little bit the created power of
[19:42] the word the power to create the power
[19:52] to create since Hebrews 11:1 now faith
[20:01] is the substance of things hoped for the
[20:06] evidence of things not seen
[20:09] by it the elders obtained a good report
[20:13] through faith we understand that the
[20:18] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[20:23] that the things which are seen were not
[20:26] made by the things which do appear I me
[20:30] God blessed to reduce word in Jesus name
[20:33] now we want to talk about by faith we
[20:37] understand we understand that the worlds
[20:44] were made by the Word of God so the
[20:51] world was made by the Word of God that
[20:53] created power of the word where God's
[20:58] servant speaking message spoken word is
[21:00] the written a seed and we understand
[21:05] that the spoken word is the original
[21:07] seed and the Bible says in Genesis one
[21:12] talked about the creative power of the
[21:15] word and he told us how the world came
[21:19] into existence
[21:21] he said in the beginning God created the
[21:25] heavens and earth and the earth Genesis
[21:29] 1 and 2 in the earth was without form
[21:33] and void and darkness was upon the face
[21:36] of the deep and the Spirit of the Lord
[21:38] Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[21:42] waters and God said it said in God said
[21:48] we're talking about the created power of
[21:51] the word and God said God spoke he said
[21:56] they meant by faith we understand that
[22:01] the worlds of frame were made by the
[22:06] Word of God and God said let there be
[22:13] light and there was life
[22:16] so God spoke and when he spoke let it be
[22:25] amen it had to be because God said it
[22:29] and God said something then God is able
[22:33] to bring it to pass he's able to
[22:36] manifest what he says so by the grace of
[22:39] God the creative power of the word but
[22:43] the word of God has always been as we
[22:46] said on Sunday the Crucified word they
[22:50] meant the devil has already always come
[22:53] against what God said as we said on
[22:56] Sunday that the devil always come to
[23:00] contradict or try to get you off for
[23:04] what God said because if you believe
[23:07] what God said
[23:08] there will be a manifestation amen God
[23:15] sent His Word to healed us he said it's
[23:19] word to deliver us but man amen that
[23:24] because of the devil amen
[23:27] fighting man's mind and trying to hinder
[23:31] men from coming accepting what God said
[23:34] in his word but when God said it he'll
[23:41] do what he said
[23:44] the word should not return to God ward
[23:48] so by the grace of God I want to go a
[23:53] little farther in Proverbs here proverbs
[23:59] 18 proverbs 18 and 21 it says death and
[24:10] life are in the power of the tongue and
[24:15] they that love it say eat the fruit
[24:19] they're deaf in life in the power of the
[24:25] tongue the creative power of the word
[24:30] now you and I where do we stand
[24:35] if create and that word got power to
[24:38] create then oh and God created the
[24:43] heavens and earth you and I as sons and
[24:46] daughters of God I am with you God so
[24:51] you have to realize is there a mature
[24:53] God the power to create is within you
[24:57] the Bible says that the man thinking
[25:00] that it's hard so we see he meant that's
[25:04] why amen our thoughts should be pure
[25:09] because we understand that God destroyed
[25:13] the world because every imagination is
[25:15] thoughts of men heart was continually
[25:17] evil and in Genesis 6 they men to repeat
[25:21] God that he made the man because man was
[25:25] so wicked because of his imagination
[25:28] their thoughts he meant so man heart is
[25:33] so wicked and the Bible tells us out of
[25:37] the bunda see of the heart the mouth
[25:41] will speak so by the grace of God what's
[25:45] in your heart
[25:45] come out of your mouth and what's coming
[25:49] out your mouth you begin to act on what
[25:52] you speak and you begin to manifest what
[25:56] you believe so by the grace of God the
[26:00] creative power of the world we gotta be
[26:02] careful what we say and how we say what
[26:06] we say because your word is actually
[26:11] creating an atmosphere and you become a
[26:17] victim of what you say things happen to
[26:22] you when you believe when you speak it
[26:25] on yourself so oftentimes you know that
[26:30] as I talk about my shoes and my high
[26:32] blood pressure mine mine mine mine my
[26:35] cancer my dis a mint you speak it amen
[26:40] but cancer don't blow to you sugar
[26:45] diabetes don't belong to you it comes
[26:48] from the devil now you cannot accept it
[26:52] no matter what your body says or what's
[26:55] going on in your body you cannot accept
[26:58] it as being yours
[27:01] this is a demon a devil that had come to
[27:09] attack you but faith you got to fight
[27:13] the good fight of faith you got to say
[27:15] to that devil they meant as Jesus said
[27:19] to Satan get get behind me Satan they
[27:23] meant you got to say to that devil they
[27:25] meant you don't belong in my house they
[27:28] meant you own God's property amen I've
[27:31] blown to God I'm a child of God I'm a
[27:34] son a daughter of God you got to start
[27:36] talking to the situation to the
[27:38] situation obey to your body begin to
[27:42] obey your confession but too often times
[27:46] we stop speaking and we just accept and
[27:50] we accept defeat but we got to keep on
[27:53] believing and keep on speaking they
[27:56] meant until our body
[27:58] be our confession they meant when you
[28:01] give up then that's what the devil wants
[28:04] you to do but I'm saying death in life
[28:09] is in the power of the term and the
[28:13] creative power of God he meant because
[28:17] your father God he meant has given the
[28:22] sons and daughters powers to overcome
[28:26] the world
[28:28] amen the overcoming God has given you
[28:32] victory and the victory is your face for
[28:37] he said greater is He that's in you what
[28:40] is it the creative power of God is his
[28:43] word in you his word evening is the
[28:48] power to create the create event and the
[28:52] call those things that be not as though
[28:55] they are so the power of God is the word
[29:00] in you that's living through the Holy
[29:04] Ghost so the word Amen is spirit word
[29:10] but the Spirit of God moved upon the
[29:13] face of the D they meant and the Spirit
[29:17] of God God spirit in it that comes down
[29:21] in you is the word that's alive inside
[29:25] of you
[29:26] the Holy Ghost is the Living Word inside
[29:30] of you that lives in you that gives you
[29:33] a victory over every devil and every
[29:36] demon but if you don't have the Holy
[29:39] Ghost amen you begin to doubt because
[29:42] it's not your battle it's the law battle
[29:47] is He that's in you
[29:49] that's the greater one and he is the
[29:51] word and the word got power to create
[29:56] even the wired makes a difference praise
[30:00] God the word makes a difference in your
[30:03] life amen you just can't just sit back
[30:06] and relax and don't speak
[30:12] sometimes we just relax and say I'm
[30:14] gonna see what's gonna happen you've got
[30:17] to keep on believing and believe what
[30:19] you're saying speaking the creative
[30:23] power of the word now in first John 3 it
[30:25] says verse 9 3 and 1 it says behold what
[30:33] manner of love now remember that God is
[30:38] love
[30:40] you know just meditating upon the Lord
[30:43] the day and there may be to see go over
[30:46] somewhere and when we talk about the
[30:53] word man in all his achievement and
[30:59] sometimes our Christians in our
[31:02] Christian Wulff and all our achievements
[31:06] and all that we're trying to achieve and
[31:08] all that we trying to accomplish
[31:11] sometimes we're so mystified and we're
[31:15] so wanting and no distant woman no doubt
[31:18] and we want to be men it's almost like
[31:22] we're becoming our knowledge seekers the
[31:25] Bible said the Greeks seek out the
[31:27] wisdom the Jews want a sign amen
[31:31] when we preach Christ crucified amen
[31:35] sometimes it's foolish and sometimes
[31:37] it's a stumbling block but Christ the
[31:40] cross of Jesus they meant so I want to
[31:44] say amen
[31:45] Paul had to bring the gospel to
[31:47] simplicity bring it back to the cross
[31:50] and bring it back to what Jesus died to
[31:52] achieve and accomplish they meant
[31:54] because they wanted to have wisdom their
[31:57] warning they meant to have signs but
[31:59] let's bring it back to the cross
[32:00] everything that you he meant have
[32:03] everything that you need a mint and
[32:06] everything God has provided he provided
[32:09] it through redemption and in his blood
[32:11] when he died on the cross so God has
[32:14] already paid the price they meant and so
[32:18] we don't have nothing to try to achieve
[32:19] in the Gloria amen if you want to go
[32:23] real in its glory in the Lord
[32:25] what he's done for us that he redeemed
[32:28] us and brought us back to God back to
[32:31] where Adam and Eve fell into God God has
[32:35] given us to created power again he said
[32:38] here the whole what madam love the
[32:43] father has bestowed upon us that we
[32:45] should be called the sons of God in it
[32:49] now I will average of God God he meant
[32:53] as I say so many times if if the dog had
[32:58] another dog you might call it a puppy
[33:00] but it's still a dog and if the cat had
[33:06] another cat it's a cat email so if God
[33:13] has sons and daughters amen then we are
[33:16] a mature God's even so what does God do
[33:20] what are the what are the attributes of
[33:22] God amen
[33:23] and I want to say God is his word the
[33:26] Bible says and st. John warning 1 in the
[33:29] beginning was the word the Word was with
[33:31] God and the Word was God
[33:34] so if you're looking at God the created
[33:37] power of God he met God him it was
[33:40] manifested in his own word they meant
[33:43] God revealed himself in his own words
[33:46] and because Christ is revealed in his
[33:49] own word they meant the people amen they
[33:53] don't see any men that they don't know
[33:55] who he is because he'd revealed in his
[33:57] own word and Jesus when he came to earth
[34:00] the Bible said he was in the world and
[34:04] the world was made by him the creator
[34:07] became the a creature integration he
[34:11] became a mint fresh in it the Bible says
[34:14] in st. John 1:14 and the Word was made
[34:19] flesh and then so God even the creator
[34:23] in the took oh and a body and became the
[34:27] flesh that was the Word made flesh that
[34:30] was God word in flesh for are you so God
[34:35] in them they met made himself
[34:39] a flesh and he got in it he meant the
[34:42] word was made flesh are you with me and
[34:46] now I hear you and I that was sinful
[34:51] flesh that God comes down amen and he
[34:55] tell the knuckles in us in the baptism
[34:57] of the Holy Ghost God gets inside of us
[35:00] and what is it and then he is calling us
[35:04] to causing us to be sons and daughters
[35:08] of God the manifested world for the day
[35:11] and I are we live in amen
[35:14] so we're living in amen this day in this
[35:17] hour to manifest the word that God spoke
[35:21] for the state or you up me this is the
[35:24] day and this is the owl admit that the
[35:27] bride will manifest the very attributes
[35:30] and life of God that we come to the
[35:33] fullness of the headstone the capital
[35:35] then perfect law are you with me so it's
[35:40] his time in it then we put away even one
[35:44] lust and all of the stuff in it hinders
[35:48] you perfect man look at Jesus began to
[35:56] strive for perfection we began to press
[36:00] toward the mark for the prize of the
[36:02] high calling what is it God word is
[36:05] perfect converting the center are you
[36:08] with me so we don't have a word that
[36:11] doesn't have power we have a word it's
[36:15] God's Word and it's got power degree you
[36:20] said now what we created if we have the
[36:25] power to do it then why are we not
[36:28] created worlds amen there is a point of
[36:32] time Jesus said I can do nothing to the
[36:35] father show me because he had appointed
[36:38] time he meant to do certain things but
[36:42] it was not because he was Amen his
[36:45] limitation was only to the world so he
[36:50] says hey I'm gonna do what my
[36:53] father gave me to do amen
[36:56] I can't do nothing but what the father
[36:58] showed me to do they meant what the word
[37:01] has prophesied and had a dame for this
[37:05] day in this hour then surely the word is
[37:09] going to do exactly what it says and God
[37:13] will have a people on the earth Amen
[37:16] that would be a meant the manifestation
[37:19] of the word amen and he will dedicate
[37:22] those people amen has been the word
[37:25] bride they meant nothing that she has to
[37:29] do in it but believe what he said
[37:32] are you somebody wish to God he said now
[37:39] with the sons of God therefore the world
[37:42] knoweth us not because it knew him not
[37:46] the world don't know who you are because
[37:50] it didn't know who Jesus was his own his
[37:53] own people when he came to them they
[37:56] could not recognize they were praying
[38:01] that he come people are praying amen
[38:04] Jesus come and God you know he descended
[38:09] in a shower he comes in a shout he
[38:13] descends and even beginning to work his
[38:16] work among the people and people can't
[38:18] see him and he began to do what he
[38:20] promised here to do in the last days he
[38:24] began to manifest himself in evening
[38:26] time and the evening light began to show
[38:30] himself by many infallible proofs they
[38:33] meant began to manifest his word they
[38:36] meant somebody got to take hold on the
[38:38] word and called the word to live
[38:41] somebody got to take a whole and say God
[38:44] you said it I believe it that settles it
[38:47] somebody got to take hold to the word
[38:49] and the word to come life in them not a
[38:53] whole lot of talk but manifestation
[38:55] we've had enough talking about what God
[38:58] can't do what God will do and what God
[39:00] gonna do
[39:01] but let's even watch what God is doing
[39:04] right now hey you
[39:06] release faith let our feet go and take
[39:13] home with the world it's the Lord I'm

[39:35] and daughters of God to travail amen in
[39:38] pain what do we call the part with our

[40:28] himself

[40:38] not yet appear what we shall be but we
[40:42] know that when he shall appear we shall
[40:46] be like him for we shall see him as he
[40:50] is and every man that has this hope in
[40:55] him purifies himself even as he is pure
[41:01] brother and sister amen
[41:04] God has given us a hope amen and the
[41:09] Word of God so pure and the hope that we
[41:13] have a mint that you and I must become
[41:17] the word
[41:19] because words gonna matter word not
[41:22] Church but the word amen the Bible said
[41:27] be ye not unequally yoked together that
[41:30] means they meant a believer should not
[41:33] be married on believer a Holy Ghost feel
[41:37] sister a Holy Ghost filled brother
[41:39] Amen that's full of the word must marry
[41:43] the worry
[41:44] Amen it should not marry somebody that's
[41:47] office you know somebody is hanging out
[41:49] in the nightclub somewhere they meant it
[41:53] was was somebody to see and God wants a
[41:56] man a virgin bride amen
[42:00] that's not a meant caught up in
[42:02] denominational thoughts in our dish they
[42:06] met hole in two main Creed's and
[42:08] darkness but she must even manifest what
[42:13] he is amen
[42:15] she must become him Amen because amen he
[42:22] became sin for us the one that we might
[42:26] become the righteousness of God so it's
[42:30] gotta be a time that we stand up amen
[42:33] and recognize who we are Amen so the
