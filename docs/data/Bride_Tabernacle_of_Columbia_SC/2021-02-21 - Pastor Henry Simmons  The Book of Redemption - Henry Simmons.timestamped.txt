[1:04:23] they meant redemption claims amen praise
[1:04:27] god
[1:04:29] he was worthy to take it because that
[1:04:32] means that
[1:04:32] somebody amen god was looking
[1:04:36] and john was weakened and he was crying
[1:04:38] because he didn't see nobody
[1:04:40] and john knew if nobody didn't step
[1:04:43] forward
[1:04:44] they meant the redemption amen oh the
[1:04:47] judgment amen
[1:04:48] and the price amen had not been paid
[1:04:52] but if the price had been paid in the
[1:04:55] blood why should it
[1:04:56] then there had to be somebody wanting it
[1:05:01] amen to take that book
[1:05:05] and when they took that book amen that
[1:05:07] means amen
[1:05:09] redemption i'll come to claim
[1:05:12] amen the judgment you know how the judge
[1:05:15] have it on the book
[1:05:16] you've done so and so on it's going to
[1:05:17] take so long amen
[1:05:20] but praise god
[1:05:23] if somebody has paid the price for that
[1:05:28] then you will have to go to jail and you
[1:05:31] don't have to die
[1:05:33] amen because somebody has already died
[1:05:35] in your place
[1:05:38] are you with me so the record shows the
[1:05:41] judgment
[1:05:43] amen judgment was written
[1:05:47] man saying man got to die that's what
[1:05:50] was in the book right
[1:05:52] but god made provisions
[1:05:56] for adam a slain
[1:05:59] lamb and gave him skins to put cover the
[1:06:02] necklace isn't that right
[1:06:05] and able recognized that it was blood
[1:06:07] that was needed
[1:06:08] to cover his sins are you with me
[1:06:12] and the book had talked about the blood
[1:06:16] the blood the blood when i see the blood
[1:06:19] i'll pass over you isn't that right
[1:06:21] it was redemption plan all the way
[1:06:23] through
[1:06:24] amen the blood had to be shedded
[1:06:28] but remember animal blood could not come
[1:06:31] back on
[1:06:32] the spirit amen the life of the flesh is
[1:06:36] where
[1:06:37] it's in the blood and animal life could
[1:06:40] not come back
[1:06:42] on a human being it took human blood
[1:06:47] amen innocent lamb amen
[1:06:50] though that lamb was a dot spot without
[1:06:53] blemish
[1:06:53] it could not give you could not pay the
[1:06:56] price
[1:06:58] angels he said
[1:07:02] jesus when he rose from the dead he said
[1:07:05] for a spirit has not flesh and bone did
[1:07:07] you see me here
[1:07:09] amen because the blood had been shedded
[1:07:11] isn't that right
[1:07:13] so jesus blood was worthy
[1:07:16] because it was pure blood everybody that
[1:07:19] was born of a woman
[1:07:21] born in sin shaping the iniquity why
[1:07:23] because the blood was contaminated
[1:07:26] amen but jesus was born of a virgin
[1:07:29] because the blood the seed the egg
[1:07:32] it was pure are you with me
[1:07:36] so he could pay the price amen though he
[1:07:39] didn't do no
[1:07:40] wrong though he the bible said he that
[1:07:42] knew no sin was made
[1:07:44] sin for us he did it for you and i
[1:07:47] not for himself but he died for us
[1:07:51] amen if we can receive it god so loved
[1:07:54] the world
[1:07:56] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:07:58] whosoever what
[1:08:00] believing in him should not what but see
[1:08:02] some folk want a parish they don't
[1:08:05] they don't believe so they perish
[1:08:07] because they don't what
[1:08:09] believe it but if they believe that
[1:08:11] jesus died
[1:08:12] for their sins then they don't have to
[1:08:15] be a what
[1:08:16] they don't have to be a sinner amen
[1:08:20] because jesus died
[1:08:22] amen to loose you and to free you from
[1:08:25] your sin
[1:08:27] so why be a sinner when you don't have
[1:08:29] to be a sinner
[1:08:32] are you with me but some folk oh no
[1:08:35] i can't help myself the devil made me do
[1:08:38] it no
[1:08:39] jesus made a way for you to have
[1:08:42] authority and redemptive rights
[1:08:44] and power over the enemy are you up man
[1:08:48] he i gotta i gotta close in a minute

[1:09:31] made us
[1:09:31] priests and kings unto god that
[1:09:34] that means god has he put us on a
[1:09:37] elevated state
[1:09:39] he made you kings and priests unto god

[1:09:43] the book of redemption now in closing
