look at the Book of Matthew by the grace of God Matthew 16 try not to hold you long amen we got a baptism shortly after the service sister daughter look like Sister Mary daughter Mary want gave her life to the Lord amen amen she been wanting to get baptized for a while and we just want to make sure she's ready and understood but she said she want to go all the way amen amen I thank God for that amen amen you know it takes courage in this hour all the Temptation things out there to say that you want to live for God amen amen amen amen I thank God for that Matthew 16 you got it say say man 16 and very familiar scripture we'll start at 13th verse we got it say Amen amen and it reads when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets you may be see that I'm going to read down a little further you see Jesus asked them a question a personal question didn't he but then they started telling them what everybody else saying amen come on that's what happens he asked you a personal question but then they started giving everybody else opinions about it didn't they one of the reasons being because they were in doubt right maybe they had some thoughts but they wern't going to share theirs because they wasn't sure amen they wasn't sure amen so but God wants you to be certain this morning amen that's why sometimes he puts us on the spot to let us see where we at y'all believe that this morning amen amen so it says here in the 15th verse he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the what Living God come on the Living God this morning amen aren't you glad you serve a living God Amen come on God that's alive not like we say not a painted fire but a real fire amen come on one that can answer your needs right I thank God for that this morning that's what it is a lot of times people they say that God is real they believe in God but you can tell by their actions in the life that they live that they don't even believe it right because if they believe and believed in what God promised them right and that he was who he said he was right it's like in the song We sung that he's most capable right then they go to him with all their heart wouldn't they they lean and depend on him realizing that he is all Hallelujah right he's everything that we all we ever need y'all believe that this morning come on at one point in our life we didn't know that come on but when times got tough hallelujah amen oh Jesus Lord when things got a little hard right and nobody else couldn't help you God showed up didn't he and he let us know that not only am I here for you Hallelujah but I gave you a promise Hallelujah that I'll supply all of your needs according to your riches and Glory my riches and Glory right come on and he never failed it did he that's one thing about him Hallelujah he ain't never fail amen amen and he never will let's look at matth I mean the 17th verse amen and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it to unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatso whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ may God have blessed to the reading of his word this morning amen I I want to talk about the keys to the kingdom amen with a sub with a subtitle topic eyes the seea amen come on it's a very familiar scripture but I believe that it was a lot going on here amen come on that everybody had eyes didn't they but everybody couldn't see could they I believe Jesus told them once he said well then as I prophesy of you that having eyes they'll see not right and having ears they'll hear not seem to be some what a mystery what do you mean I got eyes I can see come on I got ears I can hear and sometimes that's the attitude that people have right amen but you can tell by the very fruits of their life right amen that they don't understand it they don't see it by Revelation right amen and that's what Jesus was talking about here right it's more than just uh from your natural eyes y'all believe that this morning and we coming to that to the hour that we live the hour that we live we coming that you're going to have to be looking with more than just your natural eyes now come on but you're going to have to see spiritual things this morning y'all believe that come on because these Natural Things Are fading away aren't they fading away quickly but the things that are in the spiritual realm Hallelujah are bringing themselves to manifestation now but you got to be able to see what God is doing hallelujah it's nothing like a people that that know their hour of visit ation right that know what God is doing in their hour but most of the time in the world people didn't realize the hour that we were living in did they amen and when they don't realize the hour they won't know what God is what they expect or what to be looking for God to do right come on Hallelujah they'll still just come to church like they always did come on just to hear a good sermon and go back home but they ain't looking Hallelujah for signs and wonders they ain't looking come on on for the power of God they ain't looking Hallelujah for for for for these signs to follow them that believe because they don't know what hour they live in but to know what hour you live in to know that God has brought us back Hallelujah back to the book of Acts come on back to the power of God back to the holy ghost moving again come on and I don't know about you but that's what I'm looking for Hallelujah come on I said is that what you looking for this morning come on I don't know about you but I says when I come to church I come expecting God to move Hallelujah come on I come expecting God to do exceedingly above all that we can ask for think come on when I get down on my knees and pray it ain't just in in just like that but I'm expecting God to do something come on when I call on him and ask him I'm expecting him to answer come on oh Jesus what is your expectation this morning come on come on this got to rise to meet the challenge of the hour now come on thank you them that out in the world they speak and they believe or they speak right come on but what about you and I come on Sons and Daughters of God now that's been given Authority Hallelujah authority to speak the word and it'll be as you say didn't he what he said he said if you speak it Hallelujah don't doubt it in your heart now come on Hallelujah you can't doubt it amen but when you speak it you got to believe it right come on and he says it'll be as you say right come on speak it believe it and watch mountains move hallelujah oh Jesus come on that's my expectation this morning why because everything else done failure you know you have your confidence level here sometime with people right with church right but God allowed things to fail on It come on he allows Church to fail you Hallelujah he allow friends to fail you jobs to fail you Hallelujah that you lose your confidence come on but it's one you ain't going to lose your confidence in come on because he'll meet you anywhere at any time on any ground hallelujah amen oh Jesus but your confidence got to be there right you know I see those Hebrew boys standing in front of the fire there confidence were there wasn't it come on because in the midst of looking death in the face amen what was they conference Hallelujah heat the fire up as much as you want we still ain't going to bow down our confidence is God is able and even if he don't he's still able come on I believe in God and I ain't going back hallelujah oh Jesus I trust in God and I ain't I ain't taking it back Hallelujah come on is that where your stance is this morning because so many people turn around don't they Hallelujah so many people give up on the faith right it don't take a lot to knock a some people out right come on but when God is that's why it says he has to do something for you right he asked those that that that was around on that day the disciples who do men say that I am right come on now they all had been to the same Revival hadn't they come on they all had been to the same church services come on they were all on the ship that night when Jesus walked on water right they watched him Hallelujah as he stood on the side of the ship and said peace be still come on they were with him at Lazarus grave right hallelujah look like every Tri and test and everything that was put on him and he made way look like that should have opened their eyes come on but yet they still had doubt didn't they come on somebody with me this morning come on now they were all in the same Revival wasn't he come on but it's I believe somewhere Hallelujah Peter saw something different didn't he Hallelujah he can look back over the testimonies come on consider all the works that God has done hallelujah consider the the the Miracles that he's done nobody else can't do it like that Hallelujah right I believe Hallelujah that you are the Christ the son of the what living God you showed us that you ain't locked up in a book somewhere he showed us that he ain't just a god of History Hallelujah but we seen him in our midst Hallelujah that he's still alive and well come on oh Jesus now all of my doubts are gone Hallelujah come on but Jesus told him Flesh and Blood ain't revealed it did they come on Amen buddy said my father right come on that's what it is so many people they they looking at Revelation thinking they got Revelation because they got a lot of head knowledge right a lot of intellectualism right but that won't bring God on the scene Hallelujah come on all you know and all you can quote won't bring God on the scene amen come on what brings God on the scene Hallelujah Faith right come on without faith the Bible says it's impossible to please God right but with faith Hallelujah he come on the scene and move mountains right so many times he showed us over and over intellectualism Giants come on test came that they couldn't do nothing with but the one that looked like he wasn't nothing right looked like he was some cast away but what he had was stronger than all those giants wasn't it what he had was more powerful than all of the great standards of the people of that day what they had was Faith Hallelujah to believe that God will do what he said he'll do Hallelujah and they stood on it and they waited on God to show up didn't they come on I said we need people today that's going to stand on it Hallelujah that ain't going to give up they going to stand on it and wait on God to show up hallelujah oh Jesus come on but I said what it is we found that come on all them they had doubts didn't they come on but I said I said this morning God's got to do something in your life come on something something's got to happen in your life to where it's no longer it's more than just church Hallelujah something got to happen in your life to where when you see the man Hallelujah when you see the word hallelujah you know what you're looking at come on something's got to happen in your life to where all doubts are gone Hallelujah way nobody else might not understand and see it but I see it just for what it is hallelujah but I believe God wants to do that and he's doing that every day but do you have eyes to see it come on do you have ears to hear it come on I know I'm doing a lot of yelling this morning but God is good amen come on you got eyes to see it you find that a lot of times today Hallelujah church is packed out right people jumping and hollering and screaming right but didn't understand the word the preacher said Hallelujah come on you say how you know that because they go out and their lives don't match up to what they shouting about right come on their actions ain't producing the very life that they claim to have Hallelujah why they came out they shouting and dancing but nothing nothing got anchored down in the soul but when something sometimes you you sit round long enough Hallelujah and the Holy Ghost delivers the word to your soul then change will come right it'll be more than just a jump and a shout but it'll be the fruits of the Life coming out of you right you'll be able to live what you shouting about come on you'll be able to walk what you preaching Hallelujah you'll be able to produce those things Hallelujah why because the life is inside of you come on is that what you want this morning Hallelujah but we find that I says the thing is you know a lot of shouting you know but I says come on nothing ever changed did it come on I thought about that I says you know so many was in the crowds when Jesus was feeding the thousands right they had the healing campaigns there was a lot of people there wasn't it where were all those people hallelujah when he had to stay in there with barabus in front of pilot right come on where are all those Believers that shouted and danced right where all those ones that enjoy the fruits of the ministry right where were the ones that said I go with you all the way Lord hallelujah people were saying that wasn't they same thing people saying today but it don't take much to turn them around does it come on don't take much for people to throw their hands up and walk away right but I want to say to you this morning God has been too good to me Hallelujah he's brought me from a mighty Long Way Hallelujah and it don't matter to day tomorrow ups and downs I'm going still praise God that ain't going to change my view Hallelujah come on you got to come to that place that nothing ain't going to change your view come on Hallelujah but God got to get you there you believe that come on but there's a lot of people right well where I say where were they you know one thing about it the Bible says many of them they were bribed Hallelujah by the Pharisees and all no doubt they was probably passing out money hallelujah amen didn't take much to sell Jesus out for right come on sold him all right didn't take much come on but I it don't matter how much you offer don't you know that he owns every cattle on the H that's right come on don't you know that he is the great physician don't you know he is the creator of the world Hallelujah that by him speaking the world's ref frame don't you understand who he is come on it ain't enough money Hallelujah that can match up to who he is come on the one that's got power over death Hell In The Grave come on but a lot of people sold him out didn't they come on don't didn't say much did it come on but what it is hallelujah like I said they were going to a lot of those revivals but they didn't have eyes to see did they come on in the same services but they didn't have ears to hear right come on but I like how you read it a little further down uh right after Peter told him who he was Jesus begin to tell him about how he going to get crucified how he going to have to suffer Hallelujah when he go up to Jerusalem they go Peter yet begin to say Lord be you know far from you that ain't going to happen right but then Jesus looked at Peter and he said you're an offense to me he said get behind me Satan Hallelujah come on you ain't thinking like God think right but what it was though Peter Hallelujah had eyes to see he still couldn't move into his position until the Holy Ghost came right come on though you might be gifted though you might know what God want in your life it still takes the Holy Ghost to positionally place you come on still takes the Holy Ghost to put you where God wants you at come on but so many people think that they can handle it right they can do it but I said this morning I don't know about you but I want God to put me where he want me to be at how many want that this morning come on somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise come on come on it's one thing about it I says you know what it is come on you you got to let God's got to uh uh cancel all your doubts come on he's got to can y'all believe that this morning he's got to cancel all your doubts what is what is the the many tools and the many things that you deal with and struggle with what is it all about because you still got a little doubt right come on but when doubt is gone Hallelujah and faith has took the place of Doubt come on then the struggle is over with Hallelujah the hard nights that's over with now right because you know that God is with you all the time right and you know that whatever he's bringing you through it's just that he's trying and testing you to get you out to where you want to be at come on you know I thought about that it stirred me up I thought about that that talking about that horseshoe you know I heard listen to a theologian he was talking about about the Horseshoe and the making of it right he was saying that you know that they take all types of metal and they and they and they bend it and mold it up to the how they want it to be right but then he says the Horseshoe is one entity by itself and then they got the fire that's another entity by itself he says but when they take that horseshoe Hallelujah and they put it in the Fire come on and they don't just take it right out come on but it got to stay in there long enough Hallelujah till it begins glowing red hot right when they bring it out of the fire Hallelujah not only is they they ain't done with it yet but they bringing it out and they going to beat it a little bit Hallelujah and then they going to take it if they need to put it back in and put it back in the fire a little bit longer right but one thing that gots me Hallelujah that even though the fire Hallelujah is one energ and the horse is one right but when the Horseshoe goes into the fire Hallelujah it absorbs what the fire is come on then when you bring it out in this glowing red heart you can say hallelujah I saw the fire Hallelujah and I saw the Horseshoe as two separate right but now I see the fire in the Horseshoe Hallelujah they some kind of way become one hallelujah oh that stirred me up come on and I said that's what it is hallelujah a lot of people they turn new pages don't they and they just come to church right come on they read the Bible Hallelujah but what it is when when the world looks at you Hallelujah they ought to be able to see the fire in the Horseshoe right come on they ought to be able to see the life in you come on that they're no longer two but they become one hallelujah oh Jesus come on and what is the fire all about it's about a molding process it's about the bending and the breaking Hallelujah that God can perfect you and put you in the service come on and that's what God wants to do this morning hallelujah oh Jesus sometimes people want the the the word with a flower and bed of ear come on but the the word come to try you Hallelujah come to break you come on come to set you on fire oh Jesus come on don't it Hallelujah but what it is it's the molding process amen come on God is molding you Hallelujah you believe that this morning God is mending you but people don't want that mening in that molding hallelujah oh it hurt too bad right then after the molding he gets to hammer out Hallelujah then he gets the Anvil out oh God I don't want that hallelujah oh Jesus but if you don't let the the the the the the the Craftsman finish the work Hallelujah then you won't be ready for service when times come right because you wanted to stop shorty it hurt too bad come on oh Jesus y'all follow me this morning come on oh nobody don't know what I deal with that it hurt too bad come on oh Jesus but God knows exactly what he want to do right come on he said cast all your cares upon the Lord because he cared for you hallelujah oh when he's beating you Hallelujah when he's molding you I'll get on my knees and say Lord help me to to endure process Hallelujah help me to endure it because God knows what he doing how many believe that this morning it's easy to say it when the rain ain't falling when the storms ain't there but when the storm is there and the rain is falling can you still say I'mma look to the Hills from which cometh my help Hallelujah all of my help coming from God hallelujah somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise come on all of my help amen come on you know what I said it's it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory your revelation will produce a praise in your life amen come on your revelation will determine how you praising right come on some people can't praise because their Revelation ain't right right or they can only Praise of what they see the next man doing Hallelujah but when your Revelation is right it's genuine come on Amen it's real on Monday right it's real on Tuesday it's the same on Wednesday and Thursday it don't change come on with the weather why because it's sunshine in your soul Hallelujah God has done something on the inside that the hounds of hell can't penetrate come on that those fiery darts can't penetrate they might hurt this flesh they might even hurt the spirit but down in the soul that's something that's anchored Hallelujah that's something that ain't going nowhere Hallelujah that's something that even if you go down in the grave it'll wake you up one day come on I believe that do you believe that this morning come on that's what I'm resting on now that's why I'm living the way I live because I believe that God is going to do what he said he going to do Hallelujah come on that's why you can go to extra mile right that's why you can go to extra distance because you believe God is going to do what he said come on do you believe that this morning come on I said what it is come on the keys to the kingdom he gave him the keys Hallelujah didn't he we won't be go all into that but I says even though he gave him the keys to the kingdom come on you had to have eyes Hallelujah come on it had to be something that's what it is today I'm going to tell you if you just looking with your natural eyes you'll be so discouraged amen amen you'll be shaking with every wind that blow like a reed in the Wind come on because your confidence will be rested in only in the things that you can see but when God is done something in your life Hallelujah then he turns your attention to something new hallelujah amen he turns your attention Hallelujah to look up because your Redemption is drawing nigh he turns your attention into the word the way you can look at it and say Lord here I am search me and try my reigns hallelujah oh Jesus is that what you want this morning that God is search and try you come on that you won't be found weighed in the balance and found wanting right but when God when you weigh come on when God look at your life he sees and he gets all that he ordained he can smile on It come on hallelujah how many believe that this morning come on God is so good somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise come on come on I don't want to be long this morning but I said God is good ain't he come on I set eyes to see what it is you got to let God do what he want in your life what so many times you know uh like I said it takes courage but so many times people don't let the master do what he want in their life come on don't you realize he said I'll put no more on you than you can bear come on Amen don't you realize Hallelujah that it was him in the beginning and it'll be him in the end come on the same one that called you is able to keep you same one that calls you he's able to save you come on remember he already justifies you sanctifies you glorifies you come on now who can separate us from the love of God that's where my confidence is in Hallelujah that the one that called me he's still keeping me and he'll keep me even in the hardest of Trials even in the hardest of times I might not understand what I'm dealing with right now but it ain't all in me understanding it's in me trusting Hallelujah that God is going to make a way somehow it's in me trusting Hallelujah that after the rain the sun will come back out it's in me trusting that whatever was taking place God meant it for my good come on it send me trusting can you trust God like that this morning come on something break if you can trust God like that y'all believe that this morning as the musicians come let us stand amen God is good amen come on Hallelujah you feel all right this morning everybody was mighty quiet come on but God is good ain't he come on long as something got in your heart amen that's what it is long as you can take something with you amen I believe that because so many times we find like we say people shout and dance but they ain't understood nothing did they not by Revelation come on but when it clicks something will change in your life won't be no longer people got to tell you do this and do that but you'll be walking because the Holy Ghost is instructing you he's leading he's guiding you he's taking over the Realms come on he's taking it over and you'll be all right then you believe that this morning I know you will Amen Let Us bow our heads in a word of prayer Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Lord for your grace how many want to thank God
