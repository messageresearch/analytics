[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; So the devil don't want you to be made
[1:01:49] manifested and recognize who you are
[1:01:52] where you can stand amen against the
[1:01:54] foes of hell.

[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; In which time Moses was born and was
[1:02:16] exceeding fair and nourished him up in
[1:02:18] his father's house three months. And
[1:02:21] when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter
[1:02:23] took him up.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Y'all see this? Moses and y'all saw what

[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; And so, so don't think it's strange that
[1:02:44] the devil won't try to kill you to stop

[1:02:50] do in your life.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Go.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; And [snorts] when he was cast out,
[1:02:55] Pharaoh's daughter took him up and
[1:02:57] nourished him for her own son. And Moses
[1:03:01] was learned in all the wisdom of the
[1:03:03] Egyptians and was mighty in the words
[1:03:05] and in deeds. And when he was fully 40
[1:03:08] years old, it came into his heart to
[1:03:10] visit his brethren, the children of
[1:03:12] Israel. And seeing [snorts] one of them
[1:03:14] suffer wrong, he defended him and
[1:03:16] avenged him that was oppressed and
[1:03:19] smoked the Egyptians.
[1:03:21] And for he supposed his brethren would
[1:03:24] have [snorts] understood how that God by
[1:03:26] his hand would deliver them. But they
[1:03:28] understood not. And [snorts] the next
[1:03:31] day he showed himself unto them as they
[1:03:34] strove, and would have set them at one
[1:03:37] again, saying, Sir, ye are brethren,
[1:03:40] [snorts] why do ye wrong one to another?
[1:03:43] But he that he that did his neighbor
[1:03:46] wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made
[1:03:49] thee a ruler and a judge over us? Wilt
[1:03:52] thou killed me as thou didest the
[1:03:54] Egyptian yesterday? [snorts]
[1:03:56] Then fled Moses at this saying, and was
[1:03:59] a stranger in the land of Mian, where he
[1:04:02] begott sons. And when 40 years was
[1:04:05] expired, there appeared to him in the
[1:04:07] wilderness of Mount Si, an angel of the
[1:04:10] Lord in a flame of a fire in a bush.
[1:04:13] When Moses saw it, he wondered at the
[1:04:15] sight. And as he drew near to behold it,
[1:04:19] the voice of the Lord came unto him,
[1:04:21] saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the
[1:04:24] God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
[1:04:26] and the God of Jacob. Then Moses
[1:04:29] trembled, and dust not behold. Then said
[1:04:32] the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from
[1:04:34] thy feet, for the place where thou
[1:04:37] standeth is holy ground.
[1:04:39] I have seen I have seen the affliction
[1:04:41] of my people which is in Egypt and I
[1:04:45] have heard their groaning and am come
[1:04:47] down to deliver them and now come I will
[1:04:50] send thee into Egypt. This Moses whom
[1:04:53] thou refused saying [snorts]
[1:04:55] who made thee a ro a ruler and a judge
[1:04:58] the same day God sent to be a ruler and
[1:05:01] a deliverer by the hand of the angel.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; You know often times you they'll ask who
[1:05:05] do you think you are?
[1:05:07] Who are you
[1:05:10] to tell me or tell thus?
[1:05:13] And Moses, Amen, was born for for a
[1:05:17] purpose. He was a proper child. He had a
[1:05:20] mission. And the devil would try to stop
[1:05:23] you of your mission. Even your loved

[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Why don't you come and
[1:15:00] you

[1:15:03] [clears throat] I just I'm just trying
[1:15:05] to I'm just trying to live right and I'm
[1:15:07] just trying to do right. It's not by
[1:15:10] trying.

[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; It's not by what? Your efforts.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; It's just by faith.
[1:15:22] As I told her the story about the man, I
[1:15:26] said, "I'm going to get my lawyer. I'm
[1:15:27] going to do this. I'mma do that." And
[1:15:30] the man, the man was going, he didn't
[1:15:33] care. I got my cuz they got more lawyers
[1:15:36] than me.
[1:15:37] And I can get, I'mma do this, I'mma do
[1:15:40] that. A man when he stutting me.
[1:15:45] But I
[1:15:46] something dropped in my spirit. And he
[1:15:48] said, "You'll never forget
[1:15:51] how the Holy Ghost moves."
[1:15:55] I'm going to show you something in the
[1:15:57] spirit realm. I'm going to show you how
[1:16:00] God reacts.
[1:16:02] He reacts to humility and humbleness.
[1:16:07] You're not going to move the devil by
[1:16:10] Amen. by your own human effort,
[1:16:16] but by love and compassion.
[1:16:18] By humility,
[1:16:20] the devil has to move.
[1:16:23] You see what I'm saying? And you begin
[1:16:26] to speak with humility.
[1:16:31] This person that was in power says,
[1:16:34] "Sir, can you help me?
[1:16:37] I I [clears throat] understand the
[1:16:39] situation, but can you help me?
[1:16:43] Can you do anything to help me? He said,
[1:16:46] "Sure, I'll be glad to help you."
[1:16:50] Everything changed. There was no
[1:16:52] argument. There was no debate. There was
[1:16:55] a change of atmosphere.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I realized it wasn't me,
[1:17:01] but it's something dropped over me.
[1:17:05] See, you trying to handle it. You ever
[1:17:08] tried to handle your situation?
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; You and you tried to handle it and
[1:17:12] things just, you know, it wasn't
[1:17:15] working.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Because you trying to handle and it
[1:17:19] wasn't get you weren't getting nowhere.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, you were losing.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] But when you say something dropped in a
[1:17:29] wisdom from God and I said Lord should
[1:17:34] this how I should be living my life
[1:17:39] to get you to come on the scene to move
[1:17:45] that you want to do these things but you
[1:17:49] just waiting on me to get out the way
[1:17:51] thinking that I got rights I got
[1:17:54] privileges I I I know who I'm a United
[1:17:57] States citizen. I'm going, you know,
[1:18:00] somebody's see don't trust in your
[1:18:03] ability,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; but trust in the Lord with what?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And lean not to your what?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Understanding.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; You
[1:18:13] You got to know how to have faith and
[1:18:16] how to use how to make faith work. It
[1:18:19] works with love.
[1:18:22] Are you with me? So a lot of times your
[1:18:24] faith is not working because
[1:18:28] it don't have the love of God with it.
[1:18:32] Are you with me?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I want God to move."
[1:18:36] Then you must realize that it takes a
[1:18:39] life beh.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; And then you see God begin to move. When
[1:18:50] you get out the waiting, God can move.
[1:18:53] So God sent Moses down when the time of
[1:18:55] promise drew near. God sent him down in
[1:18:57] such an hour and he knew the hour that
[1:19:00] he was living in. It was the season for
[1:19:02] deliverance.
[1:19:03] How many of you believe that this is
[1:19:05] season for deliverance?
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; It's time of the end drawing nigh.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It's the time of the
[1:19:12] end of this age, the end of the world
[1:19:14] and all of this. It's the time. It's the
[1:19:16] season. Do you know this is the hour we
[1:19:19] living in?
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Israel just didn't come back to be
[1:19:24] a nation on the scene in 1948 by the
[1:19:28] United Nations.
[1:19:30] In 46 it was recognized by the prophet
[1:19:32] but in 48. Amen.
[1:19:35] The United Nations recognize Israel to
[1:19:37] come back for a season. Why? It was
[1:19:40] saying that your gentile time days are
[1:19:43] numbered.
[1:19:45] Gentiles, God dealing with the Gentiles
[1:19:48] is coming to an end.
[1:19:51] He said, "This generation now not pass
[1:19:53] away till all things be fulfilled."
[1:19:55] Isn't that right? And God getting ready
[1:19:57] to turn back to the Jews over there, the
[1:20:00] 144,000. That's the great tribulation.
[1:20:03] That's the mark of the beast and all
[1:20:04] that. It's getting ready to set in. But
[1:20:06] God takes this season, this hour here.
[1:20:09] Amen. And you must know the promise for
[1:20:12] this hour. Amen. The time that you're
