opportunity for the Sinners gave us invitation to share a little thought that God might put in our heart and uh maybe seated for a minute amen I uh really wasn't sure which way uh I should go this morning and uh of course anytime ministers got an opportunity to stand before God's people he's always real concerned about what he shares I want to make sure he's doing the will of God so uh my thought changed several times this week and changed again this morning so I sincerely ask your prayers because uh I just want to make sure I'm preaching the right message at the right time you know I know brother Simmons know what I'm talking about and sure this other ministers here can relate God and give you a thought and you're preach it at one service and it has a whole congregation on their feet and you preach that same servant in another church and everybody sits and stares and because there's a certain message for a certain time for certain people are you following me and that's what the Menace is really burdened by this Lord am I am I bringing the right message for this group that I'm standing before this morning so I don't want to preach a message for another church at this church I want to preach what God has for you this morning and I want to make sure that's the way I'm going so I say that to say that I'm real nervous this morning because I I had a had a change of Direction Change of thought this morning and just want to make sure I'm going in the right direction so I actually just sincerely be praying for me I know you are but just be praying for the preacher this morning that God will have them relax and that I'll be able to get out of the way and God can share that which he wants to share with you but having said all that I'm invite you to stand one more time we're going to look at the scriptures we're going to look at Genesis chapter 13. verse 3. Genesis Chapter 13 Verse 3. and uh and I just wanted to bring you greetings from my home church we actually fellowship with a little church up in Dallas North Carolina brother Mark Hall senior is the pastor there and we've been fellowshipping there now for about about a year and a half but uh it's a small church but I really enjoy it kind of a small Church kind of a guy to begin with and so uh kind of Feels Like Home to me but we're looking at Genesis chapter 13 Verse 3 and also before I forget I was talking to a Brother Juan last night you know brother wound up in Minnesota and he told me said uh make sure you agree brother Simmons in the fellowship in the morning I said if I can remember [Laughter] I've passed 50 for the second time thank you my brother and uh and memory just don't work like it used to so I glad God brought that back my memory Genesis 13 Verse 3 but before we read let's bow our heads for word of Prayer dear heavenly father Lord I want to give you thanks for your grace thank you for your gift of eternal life that you've given to us thank you for the word of the hour Lord that you've given us our eyes to see and nears are here not to recognize Jesus of a different age but to recognize Jesus of our age through the same yesterday today and forever Lord I come as humbly as I can before your people Lord you know my my thoughts my nervousness but God I pray the Lord I'm coming not with my own thoughts but I pray that you're giving me your thoughts that I can share something Lord that'll be an uplift and edification Lord that'll make those that are Desiring to serve you know how to do it better and maybe those that haven't committed that law maybe this might be the day Lord that they make that decision Lord that they want to make you their lord and savior so Lord we just want to commit the service into your hand take the gift that you put within us may you use it to your glory we ask in Christ Jesus name amen amen Genesis 13 verse 3. and it says and he went out speaking of Abraham and he went on his journey from the south even to Bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and Haya and the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there Abraham called on the name of the Lord Inspire his once again dear heavenly father Lord I want to give you thanks for your grace Lord we've read your word that's about as far as we can go as a man so Lord we just committed to you thank you for what you'll do in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen you may be seated title of my message this morning is the altar and I like to read that scripture again it's just two verses and he that's Abraham went on his journey from the south even to Bethel unto the place where his tin had been at the beginning between Bethel and hayai and unto the place listen and unto the place of the altar because you see this place that Abraham was returning back to was a place where Abraham had come out of UR the Chaldeans and Abraham when he arrived at a certain place he was inspired there by the Holy Spirit to build an altar and he built an altar and worship to God the god that had met him and called him out of the out of the earth of Chaldeans the god that told him that he's going to come out and show him a land the god that had made his promise to Abraham Abraham felt inspired to worship His God so in order to worship Him Abraham built an altar and I want to title my thought for the day the altar the alternate scripture that is identified as a special place before God especially for worshipers because all in the Old Testament is usually associated with worship not just associated with worship of Believers but we find Believers and unbelievers recognize that when you approach God they wanted to approach him by an altar and we will find out in the Old Testament and it wasn't just something that the Hebrews or the Jews did it wasn't just something that Christians or Believers did when we talk about this altar it was something that idolatrous did just as much as Believers did or you follow me because they recognized there was a right way to approach God and if you're going to approach God they recognized the way to do it was by an altar or you follow me so the altar was Associated as a place of worship but the thing I want to point out today is it wasn't just a place of worship the altar was also a place of sacrifice because see when you had this altered in this office altered and stand in pray upon empty Auto the reason they built the altar was because there was something that was going to be performed on top of that Altar and what they often did was they provided some type of sacrifice before the god that they were worshiping as a homage to the God and as an honor to the one that was approaching now I want to talk about his Altar for just a little bit this altar itself is is actually not very much when you look at the appearance of it because I got a feeling that the altar that Abraham is talking about here the Bible's talking about him it's talking about Abraham I got a feeling it's also it's not a very pretty thing it probably wasn't very shaped very uh you know uniquely or anything it was probably a rock that Abraham found somewhere in the wilderness and Abraham said this rock is as good as any he just needed a place in which he can take that animal that he wanted to offer to God and have a clean place and we can make his offering are you follow me so it wasn't nothing pretty or nothing special about the altar usually with you know you probably look at it most of the time it's probably some plain rock or playing Stone something they found in the wilderness so it's not the shape or the size of the altar that was important but what made it important was what was offered listen on top of the altar so it wasn't the altar it's what's on the altar are you follow me that's what made the thing important to God it wasn't the altar but it was the sacrifice that was placed upon it and the sacrifice before God listened was the thing that was separating or used to separate the worshipers for the Bible talks about the first two worshipers that we see outside of Garden of Eden it was Cain and Abel in the Bible when it talks about Cain and Abel it doesn't really even mention the altars when Paul begins to describe what happened in the book of Hebrews chapter 11. if you notice Paul never even talks about the altar what Paul talks about was the sacrifice he said Cain's sacrifice was not accepted but Abel's sacrifice was accepted so so when we talk about the altar even though the altar is important what's most important is not the altar what's important is what's happening on the altar are you following him that's what God's looking at I want to go a little further so Paul doesn't talk about what was the altar itself Paul only does it one thing Abel's sacrifice and Cain's sacrifice and I want you to watch this the sacrifice is important because the sacrifice says a lot listen now about the condition of the heart of the one that's doing the worshiping so God is not so much concerned about the Altar and it's really not so much concerned about the sacrifice what God is really concerned about is the heart of the one that's doing the worship him but you can look at the offering listen now and you can learn a lot about the one that's doing the worshiping by what they're offering listen unto their gods let me go a little further so the heart is the real focus of the worship and the Altar and the sacrifice only becomes an hour expression of what's Happening inside of that man's heart now I want to give you a couple of scriptures to show you what I'm looking at by this Jesus gave an example in the scriptures he said there were two men that came to an altar to pray both men made an alter it made an offering not an offering of animal blood listen now but they made an offering of their lips before God in the temple it came in the book of Saint Luke verse 18. chapter 18 verse 10. let me read it to you Saint Luke 18 10. it said two men went up into the temple to pray and the one of Pharisees and the other Republican and the Pharisees stood and prayed thus within himself God I thank you that I'm not asked his other man as of the men are extortionists unjust adulterous or even as there's Publican I fast twice a week I give tithes to all that I possess now I want you to watch this this man is actually in the temple of God he's no doubt standing before the altar God and His ashes in his Temple he's making his offering to God based upon his lips but his lips is on expressing now listen now what's inside of his heart and what he's doing is he's justifying himself before God telling God how I've done this and how I've done that and how I thank God not for what God's done listen but what he's done and I want you to watch this verse 12 a fast twice a week I give tithes of all that I possess and the public is standing afar off we're not so much as lift up his eyes unto heaven but smote his breath saying God be merciful to me a sinner see he knew his real condition he was in the same shape that Republican was that Republican was no better than this public I mean the uh the Pharisee was no better than the Republican was but the difference was this Republican knew it this Pharisee didn't and so it was the offering that God was looking at and the offering was showing what was in these man's heart but now watch this he said I tell you that this man the Publican went to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be a base but he that will humble himself shall be exalted so God actually was watching both men make their offering but he had respect for one offering but the other thing he didn't have a whole lot of respect for because but a man had the wrong Revelation and how he was given his offering unto God now let me keep on going God was more concerned about the condition of the man's heart then the actual Act of committing a prayer you see a lot of times we can come before an altar and we can make a sacrifice we can do certain things before God but God is not so much looking at what we do all the time as much as God is looking at what's the condition the heart of the person that's going through the motion now watch this it's the inside that God is looking at and the inside man that God is looking at is God is looking at your heart now I'm not saying that that's no matter what we look like on the outside but what's most important Above All Things is what you look like on the inside because sometimes what things like an outside don't always reveal what's happening on the inside I had a Bible study yesterday with a family and the lady might not necessarily look like everybody would anticipate maybe the lady should look or you follow me but as we said in the discussing the word with her and she began to cry Through the Bible study because she began to confess she said I've been struggling I've been having problems I want to be I want to be able to believe this word like you believe it but what was it the world was actually having an effect on the heart I wouldn't look at how she looked I'm looking at what's going on inside and the way I knew I was going inside because when I saw something coming out of the outside but sometimes brother Simmons you could have a sister and she could be dressed so tight it ain't nothing happening on the inside are you following me that's when Jesus met that woman at the well he wasn't looking at the inside on the outside because the disciples he sent him away he said because when I meet this woman I saw in the vision they gonna wonder why he talking to her because she don't look like somebody that we should be socializing with but Jesus wasn't looking at it outside Jesus was looking at her inside oh you following me so when God is looking for worshipers he's not concerned about the offering and he's not even I mean the Altar and he's not even so much sometimes the sacrifice what's most important is the heart of the one given the sacrifice but the sacrifices only testifying or what's happening inside that man's heart let me kill a little further let me give you another example Luke chapter 21 verse 1. and Jesus Christ again talking about two people and he looked up and saw rich men casting their gifts into the treasury and he saw and again we're talking about offering making a sacrifice they're casting their gifts into the treasury and he saw also a certain poor Widow cast in their their two mites so you got these rich men that were casted into the treasury and you got this widow woman who only casting two mice and he said of a truth I say unto you that this poor woman listen poor Widow has casted in more than they are even though they were given their big offers and on the outside it looked like these men really love God they blessed the church but it wasn't so much what they were given it was what was in their heart here comes a woman and she puts in two mites and Jesus Christ said she's given more than they are watch what he says for all these have given of their abundance cast into the offerings of God but she of her private has cast in all the living that she had in other words she gave her very last sense after this little two mice she had nothing else to give and I want you to watch this who made the greatest sacrifice the people that put in a lot or the one that only put into mice the one up two mice didn't put some of what she had listen she gave God this in our church she gave God all that she had I don't want to give God some of what I got I want to give God all of what I've got because the Bible didn't say give God some he said let the Lord thy God with all of that heart with all of that soul and with all of thy might are you follow me let me go a little further each person was listened was at the same Temple and gave their offering unto God but God was not impressed with the size of the offering but the condition of the heart of the person given the offer and I want you to watch this now this this uh my understanding from looking up this online because I'm just kind of curious what who might mean you know we say two minds and we say she gave all but what does two mice mean so I looked online to see what two mice being two mice is about the cost of an average dinner this woman had just enough money to buy one more meal and then she was broke you know mostly have already got enough money to buy one meal is I'm gonna hang out with this because when I get hungry I'm gonna need it but this woman that the last bit of money she had to buy one more meal she put it in the offering and she was a widow woman so she had no husband to go out and make no more money and it made me think about that woman that was in the Old Testament that Elijah came to amen and the Bible said that she came to Elijah came to her and said woman give me a drink of water and the Bible said she'd turn to get him a drink of water because she can give us water he said and bring with it and make me a cake and she turned back around she said I'd give you some water but for the cake I got just enough bread and just enough oil to bake one cake and after that that's my last meal that me and my son gonna die she was just like this with a woman she had just enough for one more meal but when Elijah asked for water she said I'd give you water but this meal part I don't know about and Elijah said bake me a cake first and feed me and then afterward feeds you in your house for thus said the Lord the crew should not run dry until God sends rain in the Earth so this woman had to recognize something she had to recognize that if I honor God first this man is speaking in the name of the Lord if I honor God first I bless my own knees what a great sacrifice you see the value of the offering it wasn't how much he had but she was willing to give her last meal in order to honor God's word that's how I want to serve my God I don't want to just offer out of my abundance when I got plenty of time I give them 15 minutes of prayer when I ain't got no time let me make time God's your best but let me keep going so these two widow woman's gave God all that they had and it wasn't much but it wasn't their mouth that was important it was what they were willing to give they're willing to put themselves into a position of self-sacrifice and I want you to get this self-sacrifice they're all cells in order to see somebody else blessed in the kingdom of God both of these women in order to do this listen could not do it Brothers it was about a revelation you see it wasn't just the act of somebody saying you better give them a tie or you better give a certain offering or you better dress a certain way or you better pray a certain way it wasn't a commandment so much as what is he recognized there was a promise associated with what they were doing and they had to have a revelation that the promise was unto them otherwise they would have never done it this woman here in Elijah said baby case first but thus said the Lord your Crews should not run dry until God says rain she had to believe that was God's word and a promise to her she had to have faith if I do what this man says there's a blessing coming behind if I do what he says and then the woman that had the two mice she had a promise too God said in the Old Testament The Book of Malachi he said come bring your tithered off into my Storehouse and not part of blessing that shall not have rumors to see she had to have a revelation if I give God my last God's going to give me greater and the reason people give these weak sacrifices and give weak decadation it only shows there's something wrong with the revelation because this is not the real altar this is the real altar [Applause] and if you ain't got nothing on this this don't matter you understand now watch is the altar both of these women can make the sacrifice they made because they had a revelation from the word what God was going to do if they approached it right and that's what some people brother Simmons are cheap on the pocketbooks come time for the first of the morning whenever they pay him they're not sure what's gonna happen if I give if I give this what's coming back but anyway you know what I'm saying so the widow woman listen that Jesus spoke of had a promise just like the other woman had a promise and I want you to just follow me here for a minute this sacrifice I'm talking about has to go far beyond just our mental thinking about God if all we got is a carnal mind we're going to be like Cain knew there was a god but he had no revelation he could build this altar but this altar was weak are you following me I'd rather have a strong altar here and nothing not so pretty here then it had the biggest best church you can ever have and be missing something here you understand let me go a little further so beyond the law our Revelation has to be a faith in the heart that demonstrates what we believe about God Israel offered God's sacrifices but the Bible says in the book of Isaiah that God said that their sacrifices though it was according to the law of Moses have become a stench in God's nostrils what was it it wasn't the altar and it wasn't the animal so much but the problem was that their heart listened and the one that was giving it their heart wasn't acceptable to God so even though they were doing it according to the word god couldn't be pleased with it because the heart wasn't correct so the point I'm trying to make is we're talking about the altar the real altar God wants to look at is inside of you or you follow me let me keep going so God rebuked him for their sacrifices because there also wasn't right they gave it but the Bible talks about them giving it without the true sincerity that's associated with revelation they knew what the word said do but there was no faith in what they were doing so God couldn't receive it now let's look at Cain neighbor here for a minute if we look at Cain and Abel these two boys were the probably the two first authors we see built in the Bible after the Garden of Eden when man had fallen were put out of the garden Cain and Abel was the first two boys that we see building altar before God and look at what God says about this offering as I said earlier Paul doesn't talk so much about the altar but Paul focused more about what they offered and listen and why they offered it the Bible said that it was faith that made the difference you see God looked down at both offerings and God didn't so much look at the altar God didn't even so much look at the sacrifice but the Bible said what God was pleased with Abel's faith because Abel had a revelation like those two Widow Mormons he had a revelation on why he was doing what he was doing and it was the Revelation that Abraham had that made God that made God happy because the Revelation wasn't coming just an emotional doing the sacrifice the Revelation was coming from his heart now I want you to watch this Abel's revelation of offered a lamb had to go beyond just listen him offering a lamb up on the altar or some animal but Abel's sacrifice was him willing to be identified with his revelation of God so much so that when he was confronted by what he believed Cain killed him not just because of the Lamb Cain killed him because of his testimony of his revelation he was willing they loved God so much he was willing to die listen church with his sacrifice he wasn't going to back down he wasn't going to say well Cain you know yours is pretty good he said all they could do is can't say why'd you do what you did he said God show me that the reason that we're here was not because Mom and Dad say some apples God show me the Revelation was Mom committed adultery and she had two kids and I won by Adam any other one was not by Adam and when Cain heard that he was rough you tried to call me the son of a beast was it the same thing Jesus told the Pharisees you and your father the devil he identified them by their work so they were and that came only identified him by what he was doing and he roams I'm angry and slew him brother Brown said on the same altar that he offers lamb can't slew him on the same altar everyone's willing to be identified and death listen with his sacrifice and that was only a type every believer real believer is willing to be identified with this word even unto death and I'm not so much talking about death of your mortal body it turns what you breathe but I talk about death to your own self you're willing to adapt to everything that's contrary to God's word to be identified with this book let me keep going how do we die we die for a reason without a god might live he said brother Mike God's already living you see you but God wants to live in you you see Christ ain't come to Calvary just so that we can walk in heaven Christ came from Calvary because brother Brandon said it was God's desire listen to living man in the Garden of Eden God lived in Adam but after the fall that life of God in man is what separated God in Adam in the garden we hear this talk about God made uh Adam a god of the earth yes he was but do you realize what made Adam a god of the Earth God was in him brother God lived in Adam the same way that the prophet said that the Bible Jesus said the Bible said that the prophets were Gods what meant those prophets Gods wasn't it Mom and Daddy was it something Bible study that it had what made them Gods when God came down it's wealth in Moses that name Moses of God with pharaoh it wasn't his flesh it was God in him and what made Adam a god upon the Earth but brother Brown said in the beginning God and Adam were one God lived in Adam in the life of God in Adam made Adam a god of the Earth but in the fall this was separated and so God's desire was to down Calvary that the life that Adam lost that life might once again live inside a man so man wouldn't just be a church goal man wanted to come into offer and offer lamb man could actually have a living in him the literal life of God so therefore the works that God does brother Simmons we can do also why because God's in you great as he is in you that heed Us in the world follow me so God wants that Altar and brother will say hi to God dwell in man he dwelt inside of our hearts let me keep going but in order for God to live in man died in the garden by sin and separated him but the only way for God to come back is that man's got to die again death separated you and the only thing that could reunite you is death because the Bible said you got to be born again brother said it this way how can you be born again except you die first this man here this old man he's got to die listen he becomes now the sacrifice when the word is being preached and you recognize when you're wrong it's something convicts your conscience something in your heart says I'm wrong and then you want to put yourself on the altar like that Republican did and said God I'm the Run wrong forgive me and brother Brown said when you died from repent and you're forgiving your sins he said that God sends an abstract the Holy Ghost the life of God unto you but you first got to recognize you're wrong and then have a desire to die to that thing you see the problem is a lot of people recognize it wrong he started recognized he was wrong but he didn't want to die to that thing recognize you wrong is one thing but dying to it is all together different there's many drug addicts right now that are recognize I wish I never took my first hit but they won't let that thing go amen and maybe they can because it's got a hold of them but if they ever get desperate enough they said God it was my fault I took that first hit but God if you'll forgive it please take this thing from me and the power of God but they gotta admit where they're wrong and Believers got it through the same thing what's wrong with the church we're not willing to admit when we're wrong we want to take sin and thought of the rug and put it in the bed in the closet do whatever you do except for a minute where it's wrong and that stifles the power of God now watch this how do we die we prostrate ourselves to our own will and our own ideas about God and his word prostrate means to completely lay yourself out you know we'll pray like this sometimes standing get on our knees prosperate me completely laid out Lord whatever you want to do like a little like a dead man on the floor have your way that's how we got to come before God completely prostrate letting God have his way and I want you to watch this we've got to die so he can live and Christ realized this himself he had to die so that you can live and he was willing to prostrate himself but for Calvary that he might die that we might live let me go a little bit further we got to be willing to prostrate ourselves and become so dead to our own desires that we can become born again that God's life can look can live in us on our altar not a blood of a bull and a goat but God's sitting back an abstract of the Holy Spirit upon your altar your heart that God can receive you because you now got the right offering on your heart the only offer that he'll receive amen now you watch this to do that we have to become a Living Sacrifice we die that he might live in us now I want you to watch how you put this in the type he said Abel is not only willing to offer a sacrifice but he was willing to die with his sacrifice and the message he must be born again he put it like this he says now the approach of this birth there is an approach to it and to be and to be the approach of this birth you have to go through a process just like anything that lives anything that lives again has to die first you cannot keep your Same Spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same thoughts now what I'm talking about here is a sacrifice and the sacrifice is not accepted when it's living a sacrifice has to be committed completely and the way you committed completely was you kill it we're going to do the offer God of land and say God here's my lamb and then wait 15 minutes say okay thank you Lord I'm taking it back home now that ain't no sacrifice but when you put that thing up on that you say Lord I'm not taking it back Lord I give this to you and I'm not taking it back kill it and the same thing with you and I if we're going to give ourselves as a sacrifice to God you can't give God yourself one day and take it back the next day you land I think an altar until something come down and kills it and brother bam said you get up without your same thoughts and we're not the same desires something in you change is why it's been consumed by the hand almighty God let me keep going you cannot keep the same habits you you cannot keep the same thoughts you got to die you got to die like he died you got to die on his altar like Abel did with his lamb you got to die with chair lamb Jesus Christ died on Calvary and he said except the man is willing to take up his cross daily and follow me he's not worried and what he's saying is you got to be willing to die to yourself the way he died to himself let me keep going you got to die Die Young thinking to be born to his thinking let the Mind happens in Christ be in you you got to think his thoughts and his thoughts listen Church it's his word brother bam said what is a thought or what is a word it's a thought expressed so if you're going to express his thoughts then we could think his thoughts is to think his word because his words are his thoughts in book formed I want you to watch this the words of thought expressed and if we're going to think his thoughts it's got to be his word and it can't be his thoughts of some other day but it's got to be listen his thoughts for this day because this Bible as the prophet said it's not a book of History it's a book of Prophecy and every age has this portion of this book that God plans to manifest in that age and if we're going to think his thoughts God don't want you thinking his thoughts that Noah thought because we'll be out here brother Simmons trying to be boat builders he don't want us to think when Moses thought could we be thinking we got to go back over to Africa to get in Egypt to come out Egypt no God wants you to think what was God thinking about your age because see before the foundation of the world the Bible said he knew the end from the beginning and so in every age he landed on his word and said in this age I'm gonna do this in this age I'm gonna do that in this case I'm gonna do that and this stage I'm gonna do that but in order for me to do this I gotta have that to work by because brother said he does nothing but through the agency of man so if he's going to fulfill his word in every age there's got to be somebody that can receive that word or receive his thinking in order to bring his thoughts to pass in the form of the word but in order to do that brother Brown said you got to be willing to die to your thinking I don't mean to be hard on nobody's Church but why won't the Pentecostals Manifest this bride age because she rejected the thought of what God thought about a bride she had her church thoughts what a bride looked like but God had his thoughts of what a bride looked like why won't the Baptist manifest the bride age because the Baptists got their thoughts what God looks words look like but the God has his thoughts of what God's word looked like and the same thing is happening around this message they're going to be many brother Simmons write his message they're not going to manifest the bright age why because they're holding on to their thoughts or what a bright age should look like but God got his thoughts on what a bride it should look like but if everybody's willing to die to your think and say God I'm not smart enough to know what you're thinking Lord reveal to me the same way you reveal the Abel reveal the being the same way you revealed that with a woman reveal to me the same way you came to John the Baptist God revealed to me that I might know your word for this age but we're getting too smart studying too much trying to figure out what we think God's saying instead of finding an altar in our home and getting on our knees and praying while there was reading them and say Lord show me that word why is this message so tore up today you got camps everywhere because they taking this message and they're taking his book and they're so dissected it based on what they think I think it come between six and nine I I think he coming uh let me leave it alone I think he's coming after the Prophet come back are you following me there's all kind of doctrines about his coming Burbank said I don't care how he's coming I just want to know that I'm ready for him when he comes so whatever he says got to happen because he's going to interpret his own word if I know that my ALT is right I know I got on me the right sacrifice listen to the church that God's looking for that I know when he comes I'm going to go with him he comes because I'm ready I got the right sacrifice let me keep going so Jesus recognized as he was teaching to disciples it wasn't just to say out enough to say I believe the word but you've got to be able to recognize the word in its season look at how Jesus Christ put it to disciples Matthew chapter 5 verse 21. you have heard that it was said by them of old time thou should not kill now Jesus Christ is quoting in a word but notice how he put it old time see he understood something he knew that times had changed see the law was until John the Baptist but since that time the kingdom of God was preached there was a shift the Pharisees didn't catch it because they didn't let go of their thinking of what God's idea of the word was they held to what their thoughts or what God's idea of the word was but when Jesus came he said I do nothing except the father showed me first he recognized even though he was God in flesh he was a man willing to be led by the spirit or you follow me let me keep going Thou shalt not kill and whomsoever shall kill shall be in danger of judgment that's what you say in old times but now watch how he changes the message but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of judgment so now what he was showing is not that what Moses taught was wrong but that dispensation has changed Brother Brad said he didn't get rid of it all but in his dispensation what he magnified it or you finally let me keep going and whosoever to say to his brother raka shall be in danger of the council that's man but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hell Fire it gone from a counsel of man now you understand Before the Throne of almighty God and given that Lord you follow me it was a changing of dispensations so what are you saying brother Holloway in order to be able to think God's thoughts you got to be able to catch the change of his dispensation and you'll never do it in your thinking and Lord knows I'll never do it in my thinking the only way we'll ever do it there's got to be somebody that's willing to get quiet enough and long enough where God can talk to you and reveal exactly what's taking place let me keep going so Jesus wasn't saying Moses long was Moses law was wrong he was simply acknowledging that the dispensation had changed the message had changed from what was to what is now let me go a little bit further the Pharisees could not see it and that's what I want to get to my point I want to bring my thought to a to a conclusion listen in the message birth pains and remember my thought the altar I started with the altar on the altar is where the sacrifice is offered but the right sacrifice is offered can only be offered right revelation because of the sacrifice is not so much the physical but the altar is here and the only way that you'll ever offer God the right thing on this altar is you've got to have a revelation without a revelation It all becomes mechanics and Cain cannot satisfy him with mechanics the Jews could not satisfy him with mechanics the Pharisees could not satisfy him with mechanics we will not satisfy him with mechanics are you follow me let me keep going birth pains watch brother bam says Jesus said that his word was a seed that a source wouldn't so forth or so now we're all acquainted with that I want to teach this like a Sunday school lesson he said because it's Sunday notice then the word being a seed and remember the seed is only bringing forth a new life when it dies now watch this now my whole thing is the sacrifice upon the altar the sacrifices only accepted when it's dead it's got to give forth life it's got to give forth blood the blood on the altar signifies the death and that's what God received brother Brown talked about how the word is a seed but even the word can only bring forth when it dies and I want this or seed the natural seed can only bring forth when it dies Naturally Speaking and that's the reason it was hard for those Pharisees to understand our Lord Jesus Christ because they were under the law and the law was the word of God In seed form but when the word was made flesh and became not law but Grace now Grace and law cannot exist at the same time now I'm going to take my time I want you to catch that there was a season where the word was a seed but where the Pharisees struggle was when the seed became flesh they can all debate to see brother Simmons because as long as the seed form I think Moses meant this well I think Daniel meant this the seed form every man was entitled his opinion but when God interpreted his own word and made it flesh that's not subject to any man's interpretation because God's Vindicated his interpretation that's why the prophet said a prophet's message can't be questioned because he comes as the interpretation of the word for that age you could deter you could you could you could you can judge a gift he said but not a prophet why because he is the interpretation of God's word for the age now I want you to watch this I profit is on a seed brother Gordon but is it going to stay a seed forever is it going to remain a seed forever that man can debate doctrines I think women got to dress like this I think she got dressed like this I think a preacher can preach 45 minutes I think I was good enough I think we should have communion twice a year I said have an office come together it's a seed but when I take that apple seed and find good ground and plant it oh man that was a peach oh it was watermelon I said it's a cantaloupe hang around when that becomes Flash and manifesting bears his own fruit you can auger all you want us as a piece the tree will declare it was an apple or you following me now watch this the only way to get there is there's got to be a sacrifice the human being has to recognize we got Canary brains no matter how much we try to stay to this thing and line it up it can come ever so close all it's got to be is one Speck off and it's rejected it'll be so close it will deceive the very elect if it was possible but men are trying to take intellect and put line up online precept it wasn't intended to connect that way the only thing that could connect the dots is the Holy Ghost and he does it by taking it and manifesting his own words then all the games say is brother Simmons become quiet why because it's not a man no more God is there vindicating what he meant when he said thus he's vindicating what he meant when he said this and when this bride takes the skies that's going to be my uh uh uh Zion Showdown God's going to vindicate what he meant about a bride's Revival he's going to vindicate what he meant about the third pool why it'll be in Flash you won't need any more interpretations but it's only for a small group let me think I don't want to hold you too long it became not the law but Grace now Grace and law cannot exist at the same time could Grace is far more Above the Law the law is not even in the picture and therefore it's so hard for the Pharisees to die to their law so that Grace could be born but it must go the two laws cannot exist at the same time there's a sowing time and there's a manifestation time but in the showing time men get so caught up in their own ideas or what was sown that when God is ready to interpret it they're not listened willing to die on the altar that God's work and live they're too tied down to what they think to accept what God is now ready to manifest are you follow me let me go a little further I'll let you I'm Gonna Let You Go let me skip down some of this the word can only produce Christ as we're willing to let the word manifest in US the heart has to be open to accept the seed in order for the seed to come in listen and manifest itself that's why brother Bram said you have to die to your thinking because as long as you're holding on to your thinking you're closing the womb and the seed can't come in God's not going to come in and fight with your thinking we've got to be willing to die to our thinking that there's a fresh wound that God's seed can be planted in how do we offer this sacrifice Paul said present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is a reasonable service that you might do listen prove by him coming in you because you're dead are you living sacrifice you're dead now you're not using your thinking you're not using your ideas all you giving God is your body you're not giving me your mind because your mind's you're going to that you're giving God your body and now God comes in your body listen and takes that body and he begins to come in you and he begins to interpret his word in you that you might prove what the promise was all about amen you might prove what the good and acceptable and perfect will of God was not what some church says but what God has demonstrated but not in the seed anymore but the seed is becoming flesh in your Immortal body but let me get a little a little further now and I'm Gonna Let You Go I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna cut this out my wife tell me don't tell them people you'll let them go if you let them go I'm gonna read you a couple of quotes stop in the message birth pains you see what I've been hungry for is Revival I've seen in a church and I've seen God move I've seen people heal I've seen people saved I've seen marriages made up again I appreciate every bit that God's done but that wasn't the promise of the age if you've heard the voice of God in this last day you know there's something coming brother Brandon said listen the world has never seen even our Lord Jesus Christ when he was here brother bam said he had the power in him but wouldn't use it he said Greater Works than this shall ye do brother I'm saying the message Shalom I used to preach he meant more works he said but I realize now I was wrong when he said greater he meant what he said he meant greater he saved the best brother Simmons for the last he was going to lie the Holy Spirit to do more in his bride that he did in his own Ministry in the message of hidden life he said it's coming from Power that even the archangels hadn't seen you're saying a whole lot brother but it's LED just ahead for the believing Church not for the believing prophets for the believing Church but it's going to take a people that's so dead to self that they laid upon for a God and so died out the self that they're hungry for one thing they said Lord I want to see you glorified in me in order for God to be glorified in Christ he had to lay up on all the Gethsemane and die that the father might be glorified in the son and if the Sun is going to be glorified the bride she's got to Die the same way her Lord died brother said Jesus died and move on the sin that he did on Calvary because the consume is where he farted out and said God not my will not my thinking my thinking of it another way Lord I'm not sure I read Isaiah I know what he said is there another way but not my will thine will be done he was willing to die out despite the pain he knew it was going to come upon him what keeps us from dying out sometimes we think about the pain well if I died and let if I do that Lord you know that's gonna cost me oh Lord if I if the Lord if I if if if I cope with that Lord you know what that's gonna cost me but die not is not easy a sacrifice don't sit there and say cut me again no no wait a minute hold on get me on this side that sacrifice wants to live and you gotta hold it there while you cut it it's painful but it brings forth if it if you do it it brings forth New Life because this sacrifice has a promise to it if we're willing to die then God's life in US can be made manifest birth pains brother Brown said we know the old seed it must die before the new seed can come out of your seed it must absolutely not only die but rot after it's dead we know that's true the same thing is with new birth will never go back but we go forward when you're born again that's why I think today we have so many or not so many I should say rather genuine news births is because the seed maybe will sympathize listen will sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to rot away from the old system that they win they're willing to go so far with the word but to let go of everything they think well I know I'm right about that what about that right there well uh that might be for you but not just repeat the most famous congregations that God showed him God has established a messenger whether it be Pastor priests I mean Pastor Prophet evangelist teacher if he's anointed by God and I give you his thoughts he's actually bringing you brother Birmingham said that's God's dress where to bring you the word but what I'm finding is that the people are just as much divided as the ministry are because they're making the same mistake we all got our thoughts listen brother Mike ain't immune I ain't said brother Mike got it all right but I'm getting before God is saying God what I don't have right God I'm asking to have mercy show me that's all I'm saying I'm not saying you gotta go out there and kick yourself and say I don't know what I'm talking about if God shows you something you hold on to it and show you something better but you got to be humble enough listen to recognize sometimes we could be wrong you follow me sometime we can be wrong but if we're not willing to let go to thought like the Pharisees to recognize what they were wrong they could never receive Christ and we're not going to receive this great promise of a body change if we're holding on to something that's not scriptural because that word that bride gets out of here she's going to be a word right just once more Samson to me typifies at least what I'm experiencing Samson was called to God Samson was the elect of God Samson was to manifest the word for that age he was a judge that God had chosen but Samson made a mistake for the Bible said he gave himself part of himself to God but listen he didn't give him all himself to God he gave his body to the Holy Spirit but he gave his heart to Delilah Delilah represented the world there were just some things of the world Samson could just not let go of I won't get into that we could we could talk about it I'm getting into that but what it did was it cost him he had to pay a price for it and I want you to get this God had raised Samson up for a purpose God was going to fulfill his word Samson only had to pay a price for his mistakes but it had nothing to do with what God called him for Moses killed a man and went away for 40 years he made a mistake that had nothing to do with the call in his life God was going to fulfill his word or you follow me Jonah got on the boat to tarshas instead of an interview but God was going to fulfill his word the bride sometimes can make mistakes she can get off path but if she's willing to Humble herself and come back like Abraham did Abraham came back to that same altar if we're willing to come back to that same altar of self-sacrifice that you had when you first got saved and the only thing that mattered to you was the move of the Holy Ghost and God in your life and that was the only thing that mattered you'll see a Revival means to bring something back is not pouring out something new per se but it's to restore that something that has been lost something that was there to revive it and bring it back again I'm looking for Revival in this church not to understand the church I'm not talking about his building I'm talking about the bride and I count myself as a part of that and I'm saying Lord I want to see more of God than I ever seen Lord whatever I've done to hold you up Lord let me get out of the way let me bring myself back to this altar let me come back to this place and let me die right here that you might be glorified but it's going to take a people that's going to recognize not some lamb on it also but you got to come back and place yourself under y'all this is where I'm losing just once more Lord I got three quotes but I'm going to read one of them because you got the point raise your hand if you got the point they might just want me to sit down God is looking for a people that have heard the truth Samson knew the will of God he didn't need somebody to come down and preach on the seven sealed heard that so many times I could preach that myself but what he needed brother Simmons was to put himself on the altar that's all and this time you put yourself in altar don't put yourself on pick it back up again like that lamb get up and take it down yeah put it down so I'm not moving until it's dead you understand now watch Samson he wanted God's word manifested before that Jezebel more than he wanted his own life you see this world is getting so dead I hope all of us feel that way I hope there's I hope there's nothing out there we see that's so attracted to us to say Lord give me five more years Lord give me just give me enough time if I can just get this money saved up I could get that house I've been wanting all my life it's gonna burn one day well don't get me wrong if you can get a house get it if the Lord blessed me tomorrow with enough money give new houses up next time you come back I might bring you pictures I ain't preaching against nobody getting a new house if God bless you get it but don't let that be your joy don't let Betty a thing you're holding on to let the thing you be holding on to his Lord I want to see this word manifested and if I got to let that house go to get it then let it go you know the sister I met with yesterday I was talking about I was crying to that bible study she's looking at her husband looking for a church they live in Charleston North side of Charleston 12 Columbia and they're having car trouble and her job she has to work on Sunday afternoon she can go to Sunday morning service in Charleston but she don't have enough time to get off out of church to draft a distancing you know if if she works somewhere far away so a job in order to get there she's got to stay with a local church and I knew that before I had the Bible study with him because I've known the couple for a while and I was telling the brother that I was going to Bible study with me to help me out the Bible study I said you know something's got to change but that's just a job I said I don't know it's got to change but that's that's that's really hindering them from being to church but I know they want to be there I said somewhere somebody's got to make a sacrifice and she had a job a management position she had for 17 years but that job required her to work every Sunday afternoon when we said in a Bible study she said brother Holloway she said I put my notice in on my job she said I just left it after 17 years I left it she said I just got hired with another company and then they said what do you require she says I require one thing I'm not working on Sundays she was tired of that brother Simmons she was crying because she was hungry for God and if that job is keeping me from being in the house of God I'd rather leave that job because I'm hungry for God that meant every bit of the six hours I had to drive to drive three hours there and three hours home last night and that's one reason I didn't get to study like I wanted to but maybe I didn't need to maybe God said I don't want you studying too hard nowhere because I got something else I want you to talk about I've been staying on something else last night but it was worth every bit of that drive to see that sisters I know and I knew her husband was solid he's already stirred you know but his wife was kind of dragging a little bit but to see God dealing with her and she said I just want to know what I got to do I said sister don't do nothing but keep trusting God I said this is not something a man can do for you same holy ghost that put that on your heart to turn that other job in and to tell the next job I'll take it as long as I can be home on Sundays because something in your heart says I need God and that's what we got to get to now I'm closing on this now watch I'm gonna read it he says Samson desired to see God's word manifested more than his own life if the if that desire could come into the church again yea he wasn't praying for a new order or a new denomination but that the word of God might be made known again the promise that he once had might come back on him again he was aware of what would happen if his prayer was answered but he was ready and in dead a dead earnest Samson said let me die with the Philistines if I've got to put myself on the altar to see God's word may manifest and so be it let me die that I might die but I'm going to see the king when the church gets that desperation we're going to see a Revival that's all God's waiting for the word is here the power is here but there's got to be a people ready to put themselves on the altar it might be one in his church I press everybody in this church I pray I'm one of them but I'm hungry musicians can come I'm hungry I want to see that Revival the word has prophesied the last time I was here I made a statement I said I believe World War III has started Russia had just entered Ukraine now that was my opinion back then I don't think it's an opinion no more now the world is talking about is this world war three China and Iran and Russia have teamed up United States France Germany and England have teamed up they're drenching down they're driving down their Stakes we're driving down now States what is that a build up to world war three the prophet said the last event that's going to annihilate everything it's going to be a third world war he said it won't be one fault with tanks on a battlefield this time he said they're gonna be shooting missiles through the air the world is there but we had a promise brother Simmons if I'm ready in that hour if I put myself so on the altar that there's nothing between me and God I'm dead to self and Christ is not living in me to interpret his own word his word said this that before one bomb drops if I'm that worried the word said before one bomb drops the elect will be out of here I want to be that word but I can't be that word holding on to my own thinking I can't be that word Holding On My Own attitudes I can't be that word hold on to my own desires I got to be like my lamb was Christ went to that garden and stayed there until he was dead to self then God was glorified in him Lord let me do the same thing let me see the pop remember I said Samson saw the possibilities and then he prayed dead earnest let us do the same let's bow his that's about his the heavenly father All I Want to Thank You for Your Grace I want to thank you for your word your written word you've Vindicated word of this hour it's not two different words it's one word Lord one was seed form now we're seeing the other one made in manifest what I'm asking first you forgive me Lord where I've disappointed you where I failed you where I've done not done that which I know that you ordained me to do but Lord I know like Samson he recognized he had fallen short before but he recognized there was a god of Mercy and he recognized there was another chance for that same spirit for the last Revival to come back one more time Lord I'm asking that you report that Spirit upon us again let us be so dead to self so dead to this world that the only thing we desire is to see your word Vindicated because Lord I know you're going to do it we're just saying lost maybe we find favor in your sight that we'll be a part of that vindication whatever he had virus in any desire said Lord I know I need a Revival maybe you've enjoyed church nothing wrong with that you might even enjoy the preaching this message there's nothing wrong with that but I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a Revival so stirred in your heart that the only thing you desire to see God's word may manifest in your mortal life if you're hungry for that just raise your hand before say God that's what I'm hungry for I want to see you come inside of me and interpret your own word to make that word manifest not a word and Seed form but now seed May manifest in mortal flesh Lord I'm raising my hand with them Lord I'm hungry for it Lord you know I've I've been crying out Lord because I'm Desiring to see something I know it's an hour and Lord I know there's a promise and I'm just Desiring Lord to see that promise made manifest again Lord bless the work here bless the pastor bless the ministry Lord bless every seed of God that's being sown here and Lord May there be the heart of God to receive it that you might make that word manifest Lord let us believe you're the one that's able and Lord you
