[36:18] does thou open thy eyes upon such a one

[36:24] thee for
[36:29] seeing his days are determined the
[36:32] number of his months are with thee
[36:35] thou has appointed his bounds
[36:38] that he cannot pass 6.
[36:47] for there is hope for tree
[36:50] if it be cut down
[36:52] that
[36:53] it will sprout again

[37:14] blood

[37:30] and the floors decay
[37:32] and does dry up 12.
[37:44] oh that thou will hide me in the grave
[37:48] and
[37:49] that thou would keep me secret until thy
[37:54] wrath had be passed
[37:56] that thou would appoint me
[37:59] a set time
[38:01] and remember me 14.
[38:12] together
[38:13] thou shall call and i will answer thee
[38:16] thou will have the desire to work on
[38:19] thine hand may god bless you reading
[38:21] which word you may be seated
[38:24] i want to talk this morning about
[38:26] appointed time
[38:28] and full of sub-topic
[38:30] looking for my change
[38:33] i'm looking for my change
[38:37] appointed time there's a appointed time
[38:40] the book of her background having cue
[38:43] two her back or two
[38:46] and one habakkuk two and one it says
[38:50] i will stand upon my watch
[38:54] and
[38:56] set me
[38:57] upon the towel
[39:00] and
[39:01] i will watch to see
[39:04] what he would say unto me
[39:07] and what i shall answer when i am
[39:10] reproved
[39:12] and the lord answered me
[39:15] and said
[39:17] write the vision make it plain upon
[39:19] tables
[39:20] that he may run that readed it
[39:24] for the vision is yet for
[39:26] a what
[39:28] appointed time
[39:29] uh so this morning i want to talk about
[39:32] an appointed time
[39:35] praise god an appointed time sometimes
[39:38] amen we're impatient but god
[39:41] has an appointed time
[39:43] he has an appointed time
[39:46] amen
[39:47] and a lot of times we get
[39:49] our time mixed up with god's time
[39:53] but god has an appointed time
[39:56] the prophet of god was bringing out that
[40:00] that
[40:01] that joshua and caleb that come to a
[40:04] point in our promising land is coming to
[40:07] sight
[40:09] amen
[40:10] but god had a appointed time
[40:14] for joshua and caleb to cross over into
[40:17] that promised land
[40:19] you know after god had commissioned them
[40:21] amen
[40:22] joshua to take over after moses died
[40:26] and joshua was to take the people over
[40:28] into the promised land it was in sight
[40:31] but god had appointed time when they
[40:33] were to march through the jordan
[40:36] god had that time appointed but
[40:39] nevertheless you know
[40:40] uh oftentimes as god's servants say god
[40:44] prophecy and oftentimes we get in the
[40:46] way we get impatient
[40:49] but job said all the days of my
[40:51] appointed time
[40:52] i'm going to wait
[40:54] i'm going to wait till my chains come
[40:58] it's something about patiently
[41:02] waiting amen sometimes we we get so
[41:05] impatient
[41:06] that we cannot wait
[41:09] on god amen to do what he said he'll do
[41:13] we get in a hurry
[41:16] but god has an appointed
[41:19] you know i i i i i'm more
[41:22] as i was in prayer i said lord uh
[41:26] i indeed
[41:28] i i i recognize that i gotta have more
[41:31] patience
[41:32] sometimes we impatient with one another
[41:34] sometimes we're impatient with
[41:36] situations and conditions and sometimes
[41:38] we just get tired of waiting
[41:42] and and no doubt it was 40 years that
[41:44] the children of israel was supposed to
[41:46] go over into the promised land but they
[41:49] had not arrived as yet
[41:51] and oftentimes amen they must have got a
[41:54] little weary in the journey
[41:57] and then they told joshua one time let
[41:58] us go up
[42:00] and possess the land but it wasn't god
[42:03] timing at that time
[42:05] so sometimes we we we want to hurry he
[42:08] meant mama we want to hurry daddy wanna
[42:11] hurry lose it on the job we want to they
[42:14] may we want it now amen
[42:17] it may be things and situations in life
[42:19] that god said be patient
[42:22] amen you must be patient
[42:25] your change is coming but you got to be
[42:28] patient amen it's coming but you got to
[42:31] wait on it
[42:33] amen sometimes we want to make it happen
[42:36] they meant sometimes we want to do
[42:38] something to hurry it up
[42:41] i'm tired of weak you know sometimes
[42:45] when we try to hurry it up and try to
[42:47] make something happen it don't happen
[42:49] the way we expect amen
[42:52] see
[42:54] you can't expect god to move on your
[42:56] timing
[42:58] amen god got his own timing
[43:01] amen but we want god to work on our time
[43:04] and
[43:05] god if you don't do it by such and such
[43:07] a time then i'm gonna take it and do it
[43:10] on my time amen god if you don't give me
[43:13] a raise about x amount of uh
[43:16] time i'm gonna find me a new job
[43:20] maybe god wants you to stay there a
[43:22] little while longer and be patient
[43:25] god
[43:26] if you don't promote me amen i'm gonna
[43:29] find the promotion elsewhere
[43:32] god if you don't bless me i'm gon oh
[43:35] lord
[43:37] i'm gonna do something
[43:38] see sometimes with situations and
[43:41] conditions and things in our lives are
[43:43] not working amen as we will
[43:46] but god works all things out to the
[43:48] council of his own will
[43:50] amen god has a time upon appointed amen
[43:54] just like he had a time appointed of the
[43:56] father he knew when he was going to
[43:59] bring the children of israel out of
[44:00] egypt he meant because god had a set
[44:03] time and appointed time that he was
[44:06] going to come down amen but he was
[44:08] waiting on something
[44:09] see god couldn't do it to moses was born
[44:13] so god waited till moses was born
[44:16] because that was the vessel that god
[44:18] full knew in his mind before the
[44:21] foundation of the world amen so when
[44:23] moses was born amen
[44:26] god was ready amen and when moses amen
[44:29] slew the egyptian moses was ready god
[44:32] was ready but the people weren't ready
[44:35] amen see sometimes god is ready amen
[44:39] god's servant was ready moses was ready
[44:42] but the people wasn't ready
[44:44] so god had to delay and let moses go on
[44:47] the backside of the desert for 40 years
[44:50] amen
[44:51] so what happens sometimes god is ready
[44:54] amen but we are not ready for god to
[44:57] move in our lives we're not ready for
[45:00] god to bless us we're not ready to
[45:03] handle god's blessing right then
[45:06] oh god
[45:08] so what happens it meant moses was
[45:11] delayed for a while and then god amen
[45:14] amen the people had got enough of each
[45:16] of it they cried out because the
[45:19] frictions had gotten tougher and harder
[45:21] and then they cried out to god and god
[45:24] moses at 80 years old he was going down
[45:27] to do the job that god had ordained for
[45:29] him
[45:30] amen at some time that was god's timing
[45:33] amen and and when adam and eve had
[45:36] sinned the bible said the seed of the
[45:38] woman shall bruise the head of the
[45:39] serpent amen and god had to wait now
[45:42] isaiah said a virgin shall concede it
[45:45] looked like it happened amen thousands
[45:47] of years later he meant that god sent
[45:50] amen the seed of the woman amen a virgin
[45:54] conceiving amen it took years but mary
[45:57] had to be born
[45:59] amen if god had a certain vessel a
[46:02] certain
[46:03] young lady that he was going to use and
[46:05] her name was mary and when mary arrived
[46:08] god knew it was the season it was the
[46:11] time and god sent john the baptist on
[46:14] the scene all at that season because he
[46:17] had somebody to prepare the way of the
[46:20] lord
[46:21] and god had mary and elizabeth on the
[46:23] scene amen because god had chosen those
[46:26] vessels for that appointed time
[46:30] praise god if god always have a aim at a

[52:29] natural land but
[52:31] here paul begin to view he says
[52:34] our conversation is in heaven for which
[52:37] also we look for

[52:58] i will vowel bodies
[53:01] praise god we might look at our bodies
[53:03] as beautiful as you know young and
[53:06] youthful or whatever but he said who
[53:08] should change our vowel bodies
[53:10] this is a corrupt body
[53:12] this is a sinful
[53:14] body to get came forth by sin
[53:17] but god's going to change our vowel
[53:19] bodies this corruption must put on
[53:22] incorruption for we shall be changed
[53:25] in the moment of the twinkling of an eye
[53:28] are you look man for this corruptible
[53:30] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[53:33] must put on immortality we shall be
[53:36] changed
[53:37] brother and sister he said who should
[53:39] change our vile bodies and fashion it
[53:43] like unto his what
[53:45] glory his body according to the working
[53:47] world by he is what
[53:49] he's able to what
[53:51] to subdue all things
[53:54] i said god is able to subdue
[53:57] all things
[53:59] and i i i i i want to
[54:01] uh because i got many things to say but
[54:04] i i it's going to be
[54:06] hopefully short and sweet this morning
[54:09] so i'm coming i i'm coming home in a
[54:11] minute
[54:13] so by the grace of god as i come home i
[54:15] want you to think about this
[54:20] to curse you is to bless you
[54:24] on as as i come
[54:26] to the closing remarks to curse you is
[54:29] to bless you
[54:31] or you will be
[54:33] so what are you saying to me i'm saying
[54:36] amen
[54:37] that there's a pointed time for you to
[54:39] go through what you're going through
[54:42] there's a point of time that you may not
[54:44] understand what you're going through
[54:46] while you're going through it
[54:48] but at the point of time job said i'm
[54:51] going through some things i may not
[54:52] understand it clearly but i know amen
[54:56] one day i'll call
[54:58] and he answered
[55:00] amen he said all the days of my
[55:02] appointed time i'm waiting
[55:05] wait why because i know my change is
[55:08] going to come
[55:09] job said another day i know my redeemer
[55:13] see he was looking for redemption what
[55:14] i'm going through i know my redeemer
[55:17] live
[55:18] praise god it's something about knowing
[55:21] what you know it meant that you're in
[55:23] the hands of god as caleb said the other
[55:25] night amen all things gonna work
[55:28] together to the good
[55:31] to know what you know amen it causes you
[55:34] to hope it causes you to wait it's
[55:36] causing you to be patient because you
[55:39] know what to know
[55:40] praise god
[55:42] so if we know what we know normals
[55:45] i'm saying numbers 24 to curse you is to
[55:48] bless you
[55:49] amen
[55:51] sometimes we don't want to be cursed but
[55:53] sometimes your blessing is hidden within
[55:56] that curse amen so much so oftentimes
[55:59] people trying to stop your amen and
[56:02] trying to hinder you but they blessing
[56:04] you
[56:05] and sometimes amen you might look at it
[56:08] as a a a
[56:09] as a curse you might look at it as an
[56:12] obstacle in your way you might look at
[56:14] it as an enemy amen sometimes your enemy
[56:18] amen is for you
[56:20] because he said if god before you who
[56:22] can be against you
[56:24] are you up man
[56:26] so sometimes we look caleb you got a mic
[56:29] just read this one uh uh um 24
[56:33] and um
[56:35] 1 24 and and one
[56:38] and um
[56:40] numbers 24 and one on on down okay
[56:43] sometimes to curse you is to bless you
[56:46] are you with me
[56:48] sometimes we looking at it
[56:50] from all i'm telling you i'm guilty
[56:53] i'm looking at it from a different
[56:55] perspective i'm looking at it as uh my
[56:58] enemies why i'm going through what i'm
[57:00] going through sometimes we're looking at
[57:03] life as has many twists and turns and
[57:06] it's many disappointments and
[57:09] and sometimes amen we look at our life
[57:12] as being unfair sometimes we look at why
[57:14] did this happen to happen why did this
[57:17] have to happen why did i have to be the
[57:20] victim why did i have to go through what
[57:22] i'm going through why amen others look
[57:25] like they're blessed and i'm cursed
[57:27] all kinds of things but god has an
[57:30] appointed time
[57:32] there is an appointed time
[57:35] that the curse
[57:37] event turns around and the curse turns
[57:41] around and in the curse it's a blessing
[57:45] amen your enemies become your blessing
[57:49] praise god amen and that's what happens
[57:52] sometimes i want you to see the picture
[57:54] because sometimes we amen we ain't got
[57:57] patient enough to wait and see what the
[57:59] end gonna be
[58:01] sometimes we don't let god finish what
[58:03] he's doing
[58:04] sometimes we getting messed up amen god
[58:07] plan amen and what god is doing
[58:10] sometimes we jump in the middle of it
[58:12] amen as caleb said the other night we
[58:14] jump in the middle of it
[58:16] amen and don't allow god to do what he's
[58:19] doing because you're going to take and
[58:21] you're going to be the big bad one
[58:24] or you would be
[58:26] you're going to take matters in your own
[58:28] hand
[58:29] and sometimes that's not the way god
[58:31] wants you to handle it
[58:33] amen he said vengeance is mine i will
[58:39] go ahead
[58:40] numbers 24-1
[58:42] and when balaam saw that it pleased the
[58:44] lord to bless israel he went not as at
[58:47] other times to seek for enchantments but
[58:51] he set his faith toward the wilderness
[58:53] and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw
[58:56] israel abiding in his tents according to
[58:58] their tribes and the spirit of god came
[59:01] upon him
[59:02] and he took up his his parable and said
[59:05] balaam the son of baor has said and the
[59:09] man whose eyes are open has said
[59:12] he has said which heard the words of god
[59:15] which saw the vision of the almighty
[59:17] falling into a trance but having his
[59:19] eyes open
[59:21] how god how goodly are thy tents o jacob
[59:24] and thy tabernacles o israel
[59:27] as the valleys are they spread forth as
[59:30] gardens by the riverside as the trees of
[59:34] line
[59:35] of lion aloes
[59:36] whose the lord hath planted and that
[59:38] cedar trees beside the waters
[59:41] he shall pour the water out of his
[59:43] buckets in a
[59:44] seed shall be in many waters and his
[59:48] king shall be higher than a gag and his
[59:50] kingdom shall be exalted
[59:52] god brought him forth out of egypt he
[59:55] hath as it were the strength of in
[59:58] unicorn
[59:59] he shall eat of the nations his enemies
[1:00:02] and shall break their bones and pierce
[1:00:05] them
[1:00:06] through with his arrows
[1:00:08] he coached
[1:00:10] he couched
[1:00:11] he laid down as a lion and as a great
[1:00:14] lion who shall stir him blessed is he
[1:00:17] that blessed thee and curse it is he
[1:00:19] that curses thee
[1:00:22] and they like anger was kindled against
[1:00:24] balaam and he smoked his hands together
[1:00:28] and balak said unto balaam i called thee
[1:00:30] to curse my enemies and behold thou has
[1:00:34] altogether blessed them these three
[1:00:36] times see what we miss is
[1:00:40] amen when the devil curse you
[1:00:43] or when your enemies are crushing you he
[1:00:46] they're actually blessing you
[1:00:49] but
[1:00:50] you you look at it and said
[1:00:52] they trying to stop me they're trying to
[1:00:54] hinder me but actually they are blessing
[1:00:58] you
[1:00:59] are you a man
[1:01:00] so i want you to get it because uh a lot
[1:01:03] of times we have all kind of complex
[1:01:06] and accusing and acquisitions against
[1:01:08] everybody amen doing me wrong this was
[1:01:11] knowing me wrong that one did this no
[1:01:14] somebody did this and some i know
[1:01:18] don't worry about those things because
[1:01:21] amen there's a blessing in the curse
[1:01:25] are you with me
[1:01:26] so sometimes
[1:01:28] we get out of god's
[1:01:30] perfect plan and provision uh for our
[1:01:34] lives amen
[1:01:37] yo
[1:01:38] sometimes i i go to all these scriptures
[1:01:40] but i gotta go
[1:01:41] as i feel led this morning first
[1:01:44] corinthians two first corinthians two
[1:01:47] uh so there's a blessing in the curse
[1:01:50] i got excited because i wanted to take
[1:01:53] time out to let you know because a lot
[1:01:56] of times we run from our blessing
[1:01:59] we actually run for from our blessing we
[1:02:02] try to get in the way of what god is
[1:02:04] doing in our lives and we i'ma tell you
[1:02:07] something amen you're gonna have to come
[1:02:09] right back to where god where you
[1:02:11] started it right back from what you're
[1:02:13] running from god gonna bring it right
[1:02:15] back to you

[1:02:20] plan and the mission of god amen what
[1:02:22] god got for you you got to do it

[1:02:28] it doesn't matter what jonah tried to do
[1:02:31] amen jonah had to do what god said
[1:02:34] are you with me if god had ordained you
[1:02:36] for a certain purpose and for a certain
[1:02:39] reason you got to settle down and be
[1:02:41] patient and said i'ma wait until my
[1:02:43] change come

[1:02:48] amen god chose you for a certain purpose
[1:02:51] now look what happened amen uh baal them

[1:03:19] and 7. he says
[1:03:22] first corinthians 2 and 7 it says but we
[1:03:25] speak the wisdom of god in a mystery
[1:03:27] even the hidden wisdom which uh god
[1:03:31] for
[1:03:32] god ordained before the world unto his
[1:03:35] glory
[1:03:36] god got it all controlled before the
[1:03:38] world was

[1:05:43] situation it causes how you look at amen
[1:05:47] praise god your curse

[1:05:50] hallelujah sometimes we're looking at it
[1:05:52] from uh
[1:05:54] uh a pity party perspective
[1:05:57] instead of looking at it from uh uh a
[1:06:00] blessing perspective
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:03] but perhaps jesus said why why
[1:06:06] jesus said
[1:06:07] if it be possible let this cup pass
[1:06:12] man that
[1:06:13] that had done no wrong to have power to
[1:06:15] call 12 legion angels
[1:06:18] yet they spit on him
[1:06:20] yet they call him the prince of devils
[1:06:23] yet they didn't like him all he did was
[1:06:26] good
[1:06:28] that's all he did
[1:06:30] amen no man has suffered like jesus
[1:06:32] suffered
[1:06:33] and had the kind of power that he had
[1:06:36] but yet he went through
[1:06:40] and loved uh a wretched like you and i
[1:06:44] to die
[1:06:45] now look he says
[1:06:47] and this is what i want to ask you
[1:06:49] here
[1:06:53] the wisdom of god and the mystery even
[1:06:54] the hidden words and with god ordained
[1:06:57] before the
[1:06:58] world and to his glory
[1:06:59] which none of the what
[1:07:04] let me tell you the devil
[1:07:06] the bible said
[1:07:08] they did it in the green tree they do it
[1:07:10] in the draw
[1:07:13] he said
[1:07:15] the world don't know you
[1:07:17] and neither did the world know him
[1:07:20] are you with me
[1:07:23] the world the devil don't know who you
[1:07:25] are
[1:07:27] the devil told him if you be
[1:07:31] see he was thinking that he might have
[1:07:33] was but i don't know for certain she
[1:07:35] said if you be the son of god
[1:07:39] praise god but jesus knew what
[1:07:43] that's right
[1:07:45] and see you got to know who you are
[1:07:48] the devil will question amen and have
[1:07:51] you to doubt who you are
[1:07:54] amen but you got to know who you are
[1:07:58] whose i am paul said in whom i said
[1:08:03] i got to know who my whose i am
[1:08:06] i got to know that i'm a son of god i
[1:08:09] got to know you got to know your
[1:08:10] daughter of god you got to know that god
[1:08:13] is your father you got to know amen your
[1:08:15] sons and daughters of god
[1:08:17] you got to know the devil don't quite
[1:08:19] know it that's why
[1:08:22] the bible said none of the princes of
[1:08:24] this world knew had they known it they
[1:08:28] what
[1:08:29] they would not have crucified the what
[1:08:33] see what i'm saying see they wouldn't
[1:08:35] have killed them if they would have
[1:08:36] known
[1:08:38] amen they would not have crucified the
[1:08:40] lord of glory because in his death
[1:08:45] praise god when they tried to cast him
[1:08:49] they meant it was a
[1:08:50] blessing amen why because god had a
[1:08:53] hidden plan
[1:08:55] oh god
[1:08:57] god has a hidden plan for all you've
[1:09:00] been through
[1:09:01] glory to god all you going through
[1:09:05] amen praise god there's a diamond in the
[1:09:07] roof
[1:09:08] amen god got a plan oh hallelujah god
[1:09:12] you're working some out for me
[1:09:15] hallelujah yes i've been through the
[1:09:17] strain i've been through the stone
[1:09:20] with god working some house
[1:09:22] hallelujah
[1:09:24] praise god
[1:09:26] hallelujah i i i i said that's a
[1:09:28] blessing
[1:09:29] uh uh the none of the princes of the
[1:09:32] world knew but about i want to ask you
[1:09:35] the question but do you know
[1:09:38] they didn't know if they'd have known
[1:09:40] they were to persecute you
[1:09:42] i said there's a blessing in the curse
[1:09:45] remember
[1:09:46] what what's what what you're going
[1:09:48] through what the devil trying to take
[1:09:49] you through there's a blessing in it
[1:09:52] praise god hallelujah
[1:09:54] if they would only knew
[1:09:58] praise god that's why jesus said forgive
[1:10:00] them
[1:10:03] are you with me that's why stephen knew
[1:10:06] that they might lay this knot at their
[1:10:08] child though they stole me ain't that
[1:10:11] god forgive them because amen i don't
[1:10:13] want you to lay that in charge
[1:10:16] are you with me
[1:10:18] see sometimes we got to understand that
[1:10:20] there's a blessing in the curse
[1:10:23] amen praise god so he
[1:10:28] so
[1:10:29] i got to go
[1:10:30] a little farther uh matthew 5
[1:10:33] matthew 5 because sometimes we mistaken
[1:10:37] we we bypass our blessing because we
[1:10:40] look at what we see because the things
[1:10:42] that are seen are temporal sometimes we
[1:10:45] overlook the blessings amen in our
[1:10:48] suffering the bible said the captain of
[1:10:50] our salvation made perfect through the
[1:10:52] things that he suffered and sometimes we
[1:10:54] don't want to suffer but the bible said
[1:10:56] eyes have not seen it have not heard
[1:10:59] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:11:00] man the things that god has prepared for
[1:11:03] them amen hey hallelujah
[1:11:06] i'm looking for my chains
[1:11:08] amen all the days of my appointed time
[1:11:11] i'm gonna wait
[1:11:14] till my change come because i got a
[1:11:16] pointed time for things to turn around
[1:11:20] amen whipping man do it for night
[1:11:23] but joy coming in the morning praise god
[1:11:26] hallelujah
[1:11:28] praise god when the night is gone
[1:11:31] and the sun is shining
[1:11:33] thank god hallelujah
[1:11:35] oh god
[1:11:39] so matthew here amen 5 and 10 it says
[1:11:44] blessed are they which are what
[1:11:49] sometimes i wonder
[1:11:52] do you know where your blessing's coming
[1:11:54] from
[1:11:55] praise god i i think
[1:11:57] as long as everything's going good
[1:12:00] we can sing thank god you know your joy
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:04] but you will your joy coming from
[1:12:06] because amen you get joy
[1:12:09] for what he done for me
[1:12:12] i get joy when i think about
[1:12:16] amen
[1:12:17] see god has done something he doesn't
[1:12:19] bought you through something that's what
[1:12:21] you're shouting about that's why you're
[1:12:24] happy
[1:12:25] amen that's what i'm encouraged about
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:30] say here he says
[1:12:32] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:12:35] for righteousness sake
[1:12:37] for theirs is the what
[1:12:40] you see what i'm saying
[1:12:43] i said
[1:12:45] your promised land is in sight
[1:12:48] and i want you to see where your
[1:12:50] blessings are coming from
[1:12:52] he says
[1:12:54] blessed are ye
[1:12:55] when men shall what
[1:12:58] revile you
[1:13:00] and what
[1:13:01] the persecute you and shall what
[1:13:06] falsely for what
[1:13:09] amen
[1:13:10] what
[1:13:11] what it says read what
[1:13:14] rejoice and what
[1:13:19] i wonder how many of us do that
[1:13:24] i wonder how many of us really really
[1:13:26] really rejoice
[1:13:29] you know some of the saddest people in
[1:13:31] the in the world is the church folk
[1:13:34] because they say look what someone said
[1:13:37] no none this song had done that
[1:13:39] everybody done something
[1:13:42] and the devil had us with our head hung
[1:13:44] down
[1:13:45] but he said rejoice and be what
[1:13:50] that's when you're going through
[1:13:51] something you ought to be happy
[1:13:54] amen but you can't be happy because
[1:13:56] you don't know
[1:13:59] the bible said had he known the princes
[1:14:02] of the word no they would not have
[1:14:03] crucified him
[1:14:05] if balaam
[1:14:07] they like would have known that in
[1:14:09] cursing israel he was going to bless
[1:14:11] them he wouldn't have never sent paid
[1:14:14] all his money and sent bail him down
[1:14:16] because
[1:14:17] are you a man
[1:14:19] but you got to understand that there's a
[1:14:21] blessing in the curse
[1:14:23] amen that god is blessing you from what
[1:14:26] you've been through going through that i
[1:14:28] don't know how amen god
[1:14:31] pull out
[1:14:32] blessings that you won't have room
[1:14:34] enough to receive
[1:14:35] god is blessing you with abundance
[1:14:39] amen the more you amen
[1:14:42] absorb the persecution look what job god
[1:14:45] restored all the job ever went through
[1:14:48] god gave him everything back
[1:14:52] amen hallelujah
[1:14:54] so what i'm saying the enemy amen may
[1:14:57] try to hold you down
[1:15:00] but he can't do it
[1:15:02] he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[1:15:05] amen for great is your reward in heaven
[1:15:09] for so persecuted they the prophets
[1:15:11] would work before you
[1:15:14] okay
[1:15:15] our last verse
[1:15:18] i said i was gonna be shocked but it
[1:15:19] looked like i went wrong
[1:15:21] 50
[1:15:22] genesis 50.
[1:15:25] praise god
[1:15:26] i swear to preach it but i i slowed down
[1:15:29] on purpose because i really want you to
[1:15:32] to absolve it
[1:15:33] because if you don't absolve it and
[1:15:35] really see it amen sometimes you'll go
[1:15:38] back and you'll make the same mistakes
[1:15:40] over and over and over
[1:15:42] you'll
[1:15:44] maybe some situation is waiting on the
[1:15:46] job some situation is waiting in the
[1:15:48] home some situation is gonna
[1:15:51] it's gonna happen this week
[1:15:53] but
[1:15:54] you got to realize that there's a
[1:15:55] blessing when they try to curse you that
[1:15:58] god got a blessing in that
[1:16:00] are you with me
[1:16:02] praise god and whatever you've been
[1:16:04] through amen it might have been holding
[1:16:06] you down for years it might have been
[1:16:07] holding you down for quite a long spell
[1:16:10] in your life but
[1:16:12] realizing that now is the appointed time
[1:16:15] god has a set time an appointed time to
[1:16:18] bring the children out and god got a set
[1:16:20] time and appointed time to even bring us
[1:16:24] out also god has a set time amen joseph
[1:16:27] was separated from his brothers for a
[1:16:29] long time amen praise god not because
[1:16:32] joseph wanted to be separated joseph was
[1:16:34] separated because his brothers had a
[1:16:37] plan they had a jealous spirit against
[1:16:40] him and because they had a jealous
[1:16:42] spirit against him the in 50 and 17.
[1:16:46] you all know the story of joseph how he
[1:16:48] was soldier in the egypt he said
[1:16:50] so
[1:16:52] so shall ye
[1:16:54] say unto joseph
[1:16:56] jacob telling them what they need to say
[1:16:58] to joseph
[1:17:00] forgive
[1:17:01] i pray thee now
[1:17:03] the trespasses of your brethren
[1:17:06] and their sin
[1:17:08] for they did
[1:17:10] unto thee evil
[1:17:13] see
[1:17:14] they did evil you see what i'm saying
[1:17:18] you know
[1:17:19] you think those brothers knew
[1:17:21] amen they just was overcome with the
[1:17:23] spirit
[1:17:25] and
[1:17:26] and they didn't they didn't mean
[1:17:28] it i mean at that particular time they
[1:17:33] were caught you know sometimes peter
[1:17:35] said i go on deny you i won't deny you
[1:17:39] why because amen
[1:17:41] and jesus said get behind me satan
[1:17:45] saul consented to stephen's death he was
[1:17:47] right there do you know god didn't hold
[1:17:50] him
[1:17:50] didn't lay that to his charge
[1:17:53] are you with me so i'm saying why what
[1:17:56] what god planned for saul's life amen
[1:18:01] he went through certain things but god
[1:18:03] had a plan it did not interrupt god's
[1:18:06] plan for his life god was going to turn
[1:18:08] things around amen and the one that saw
[1:18:11] was persecuting saul was going to turn
[1:18:13] around and be a blessing to those people
[1:18:16] that he looked like he hated
[1:18:19] god was going to turn around
[1:18:22] praise god
[1:18:25] so brother and sister look he says
[1:18:32] his father joseph
[1:18:35] and joseph wept
[1:18:37] when they speak unto him in 18 verses
[1:18:40] and his brothers also went and fell down
[1:18:43] before his face and they said behold
[1:18:47] we be thy servants
[1:18:50] and joseph said unto them fear not
[1:18:54] i am
[1:18:56] if i am i
[1:18:59] in this place
[1:19:03] i'm i'm in this i'm in the place of god
[1:19:05] am i
[1:19:06] am i in the place of god
[1:19:09] but
[1:19:10] as for you
[1:19:13] ye thought what
[1:19:15] you thought evil against me but what
[1:19:22] you see what i'm saying
[1:19:24] we make we make major mistakes in life
[1:19:28] praise god you
[1:19:29] see joseph had to come to a conclusion
[1:19:32] that
[1:19:33] i wouldn't be where i am had not you
[1:19:36] done what you done
[1:19:42] see what i'm saying
[1:19:44] sometimes i will mistakes and i will
[1:19:47] the things that we do when we make
[1:19:49] mistakes and we make bad decisions i
[1:19:52] make them all of us do and sometimes we
[1:19:56] we think that somebody's done us wrong
[1:19:58] and and sometimes we cry
[1:20:00] i'm guilty we all are guilty sometimes
[1:20:04] so um
[1:20:05] but
[1:20:06] we don't understand
[1:20:07] that god's purpose and plan for our
[1:20:10] lives
[1:20:11] amen god will make things a curse and be
[1:20:14] a blessing
[1:20:16] are you look man so he says
[1:20:22] as you meant it for evil god meant it
[1:20:25] for good
[1:20:27] to bring to pass
[1:20:29] as it is this day to save much people's
[1:20:33] lives
[1:20:34] are you with me
[1:20:36] see god wanted to save a lot of lives
[1:20:40] and that's this is the way he did it
[1:20:43] so
[1:20:44] you know you don't say all things work
[1:20:46] together
[1:20:48] and so what i'm saying to you i hope
[1:20:51] that you see the blessing
[1:20:53] and that you ought to be happy
[1:20:56] amen instead of holding the devil hold
[1:20:59] something over your head he hold it down
[1:21:02] hold it there all right
[1:21:03] and
[1:21:04] and then
[1:21:05] god is saying let it go
[1:21:08] because behind him and letting it go
[1:21:11] amen you'll see the blessing in it
[1:21:16] praise god you'll see the blessing amen
[1:21:18] praise god hallelujah somebody went
[1:21:21] through the same thing you went through
[1:21:24] amen and they didn't make it
[1:21:27] are you with me
[1:21:28] somebody went through what you were
[1:21:30] going through and they did not make it
[1:21:36] praise god their response and their
[1:21:38] reaction to what they were going through
[1:21:41] amen you amen are in a situation that
[1:21:44] you can come out they were in a
[1:21:46] situation that they can't get out of it
[1:21:48] hallelujah

[1:21:56] speaking to somebody amen i i got so
[1:22:00] happy until i wanted to preach
[1:22:03] i wanted to preach
[1:22:04] but i i realized that i i said i gotta
[1:22:07] let this sink in
[1:22:09] because whatever
[1:22:11] whatever the devil meant for evil
[1:22:15] amen and the devil tried to curse
[1:22:19] and why he's trying to curse
[1:22:21] it's a blessing
[1:22:23] but you don't see it as a blessing
[1:22:25] that's why you amen don't wait
[1:22:29] that's why you're impatient
[1:22:32] amen but job said

[1:22:59] amen and really tell the story
[1:23:02] even how i felt when he even spoke to me
[1:23:06] praise god if i could tell you how i
[1:23:09] felt
[1:23:10] amen because god was speaking to me
[1:23:13] praise god he was telling me all about
[1:23:16] amen he was taking me back to my
[1:23:18] troubles
