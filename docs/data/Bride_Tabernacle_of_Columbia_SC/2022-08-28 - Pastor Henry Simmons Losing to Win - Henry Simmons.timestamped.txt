[37:46] amen
[37:49] the book of philippians
[37:52] the third chapter
[37:55] we thank god again
[37:58] philippians 3 and 7 through
[38:02] 14. i think it is
[38:05] philippians 3 7 through 14.
[38:08] okay i'll start i read the first you
[38:10] read the next we read the last verse
[38:12] together
[38:14] what things were gained to me those that
[38:17] count laws for christ
[38:24] okay
[38:24] philippines
[38:26] three excuse me
[38:29] seven through fourteen philippians 3
[38:33] 7-14 but
[38:35] but what things were gained to me those
[38:37] that count loss for christ
[38:55] and
[38:56] we found in him not having my own
[38:58] righteousness which is of the law
[39:01] but that which is through
[39:04] the faith
[39:05] of christ
[39:06] the righteousness which is of god by
[39:09] faith 10.
[39:20] if by any means i might attain into the
[39:23] resurrection of the dead twelve
[39:38] brethren i count not myself to have
[39:41] apprehended but one thing
[39:44] i do
[39:45] forgetting those things which are behind
[39:47] and reaching forth into those things
[39:49] which are before fourteen i press
[39:52] towards the mark of the prize of the
[39:54] hard calling of god
[39:56] in christ jesus god bless during his
[39:58] word you may be seated
[40:01] amen
[40:03] because
[40:04] i thought on
[40:06] the other day was just in prayer
[40:09] and i thought how blessed we are
[40:13] and uh we're
[40:14] we certainly bless people
[40:17] and um
[40:19] and then i thought on many things about
[40:22] how christ is
[40:25] this is god throughout all ages
[40:28] and i thought about the absolute that
[40:30] he's our absolute
[40:34] there's none like him
[40:36] there's no other god besides him
[40:40] amen
[40:42] and we cannot put anything on the level
[40:44] of him
[40:46] for there's no equal
[40:47] [Music]
[40:49] there's no man there's no prophet
[40:51] there's no preacher there's no
[40:53] you know when it came down to moses and
[40:55] elijah
[40:57] amen and it was in the mountain of
[40:59] transfiguration
[41:01] and uh peter said lord it's good for us
[41:03] to be here let us build three
[41:05] tabernacles one for them one for moses
[41:07] and one for elijah
[41:09] amen and then they looked again and they
[41:11] saw save jesus only
[41:14] and it was saying
[41:17] i want you to hear him
[41:19] jesus
[41:21] amen
[41:22] so there's no room
[41:25] to con to equal
[41:28] jesus christ because he is god
[41:31] are you with me
[41:33] there's not
[41:35] amen anything that's going to be supreme
[41:39] are going to be
[41:41] over
[41:42] above
[41:44] jesus christ
[41:45] but he's god
[41:48] and his word in him a one is not three
[41:53] that we are trying to compare or
[41:55] equalize
[41:56] we're not trying to equalize anything
[41:59] we're not trying to bring anything up to
[42:01] that place or that standard
[42:03] amen
[42:04] god in his word is one
[42:08] jesus is god
[42:10] are you a man
[42:12] so when we look at it and people try to
[42:14] put anything on that same level
[42:18] amen
[42:19] it cannot be compared
[42:21] amen are you with me
[42:24] so sometimes we'll take words of men and
[42:27] we'll take words of churches and words
[42:29] of different ones and we'll try to level
[42:32] it off and meet it because it could be
[42:35] that they're saying the truth but
[42:36] speaking the same thing but we don't
[42:38] want to get confused
[42:41] there's nothing like him
[42:43] praise god thank god
[42:45] for god's servant in this hour thank god
[42:48] for each and every one of you amen but
[42:51] there's nothing like him
[42:53] amen save jesus only
[42:56] he's our only savior
[42:58] eve the one that died for us
[43:02] and without his death
[43:05] praise god i don't know what people are
[43:07] arguing about
[43:09] amen i want you to let that be
[43:11] established in your hearts
[43:14] amen because people are pointing you to
[43:17] all kind of signs and all kind of things
[43:20] but you got to be pointed back to the
[43:22] word
[43:23] because the word is god amen it's christ
[43:26] throughout all ages
[43:28] it wasn't moses it was christ in moses
[43:31] are you a man
[43:32] so amen it's the christ that's in you
[43:36] that makes the difference
[43:38] it's not you that's holy it's god that's
[43:40] holy in you
[43:42] amen when god get in you that's what
[43:44] makes the mountain holy
[43:47] and that's what makes you holy people
[43:49] because the holy god comes down and
[43:52] tabernacles within you
[43:56] are you up man
[43:59] so by the grace of god this morning
[44:02] uh i don't know i just gave you a little
[44:04] prelude or something else
[44:06] things that was on my heart but let me
[44:08] just talk about
[44:10] losing to win
[44:12] i think i ministered this some time back
[44:15] but it just came fresh on me as
[44:18] i was preparing to
[44:21] minister a funeral this afternoon
[44:25] and i said lord i just
[44:28] can't get away from it maybe i'll share
[44:30] some of these things this morning with
[44:32] you all
[44:34] losing to win
[44:36] um
[44:38] in the seventh verse of philippians but
[44:41] what things were gained to me those i
[44:43] count laws for christ
[44:47] are you with me
[44:49] see uh paul had gained a lot
[44:54] amen
[44:56] when you have a lot you have a lot to
[44:58] lose
[45:00] paul had you know he's probably studied
[45:04] under the academic world or or
[45:08] something like harvard yale or
[45:11] oxford uh some big
[45:14] uh
[45:15] school of theology
[45:18] and was under the best teachers in the
[45:20] world
[45:22] and he had attained amen authority
[45:26] to persecute the church to go down and
[45:29] find any that was going against well uh
[45:32] the religion of that day the jewish
[45:34] religion the god that he knew that it
[45:36] was only one god and it was uh uh a
[45:39] jehovah god
[45:41] and he wasn't gonna allow anybody amen
[45:47] to
[45:48] bring
[45:50] heresies in
[45:52] that which he thought
[45:55] so he thought that jesus was a false
[45:58] teacher a prophet
[46:01] and that he wasn't going to let anything
[46:03] anybody go against his teaching as a
[46:06] pharisee
[46:08] and sometimes people are fight for what
[46:10] they believe it used to be if a person
[46:13] was a
[46:14] a certain denomination they would stand
[46:16] on what they believe now
[46:18] people say everything goes
[46:20] don't worry about another just as long
[46:22] as you believe in god
[46:24] don't make no difference if you're
[46:26] buddha hindu is a confucianism muslim
[46:29] whatever just as long as you believe in
[46:31] god it's the same god
[46:33] so everybody's under we don't have
[46:36] confrontations anymore because it's all
[46:38] about love
[46:40] everybody just love it don't matter
[46:44] and so
[46:45] but when
[46:47] it was a disturbance
[46:49] it disturbed everything when jesus came
[46:52] that way amen and and and he was doing
[46:55] things and signs and wonders and
[46:57] miracles
[46:58] and even raised the dead and even
[47:01] ladders stinking for four days and he
[47:04] called him back from the dead and they
[47:06] never seen such things and it was it was
[47:09] actually doing something to uh their
[47:12] authority and the positions and their
[47:14] churches it was causing amen people to
[47:18] leave and go after this man called jesus
[47:22] so things were happening brother and
[47:24] sister i'm just saying that that you and
[47:28] i as christians amen
[47:30] you know uh you should not try to get
[47:34] fathers to come after you or come to
[47:36] your church it should be about the god
[47:39] that's in you that you're trying to
[47:41] introduce jesus to the people
[47:44] that jesus christ is god and that god
[47:47] shouldn't be a god that's for all that
[47:50] should be a life that inside of you
[47:55] praise god they'll come to know jesus
[47:59] they meant the life that's living amen
[48:02] the life that i now live
[48:06] i'm trying to introduce you to
[48:08] a god that's alive and a god that's a
[48:11] real and a god that
[48:13] changed my life a god that's in my life
[48:17] praise god
[48:19] a real and true living god
[48:22] that made a difference
[48:25] so here
[48:27] uh
[48:28] paul says when he ran into
[48:31] contact with the real god
[48:33] he realized that all i gained
[48:36] to lose
[48:39] is to win
[48:41] i'm willing to lose everything
[48:45] that i might win
[48:47] amen
[48:49] i'm saying this morning your loss is
[48:51] your game
[48:55] your dying is
[48:57] to live
[48:59] when you die you can live
[49:02] because real life don't exist outside of
[49:05] him
[49:05] [Music]
[49:07] praise god without him
[49:10] amen i'm like a ship without a sail
[49:13] without him i can do nothing if he
[49:16] didn't have marching on me this morning
[49:19] all right god i couldn't get up
[49:21] because it's only by the mercy and grace
[49:24] of god
[49:25] that i'm standing here this morning amen
[49:28] not how good i was and how strong
[49:30] am i but it's by the grace of god
[49:33] i am what i am
[49:36] thank god it's grace
[49:38] thank god he cared enough about me
[49:40] somebody said awake me with a finger of
[49:42] love praise god i thank god for him
[49:46] here in um philippians
[49:50] 1 and 21 it says
[49:53] uh
[49:54] for me to live
[49:57] is christ
[49:58] and to die is gain
[50:01] are you with me
[50:04] to live is christ in the dies game
[50:08] you know
[50:10] oftentimes amen we look at
[50:13] losing
[50:17] to die we're lost
[50:20] but to die is to gain
[50:23] we haven't lost anything to die is the
[50:26] game not to lose
[50:29] praise god
[50:31] i'm telling you brother and sister amen
[50:33] it comes down to our lives and amen and
[50:36] when we stand in jeopardy amen of losing
[50:39] everything
[50:41] amen we want to hold on to everything
[50:44] that we have because well uh we feel
[50:47] like we got to uh you know i i gotta
[50:50] have this and i gotta have that and we
[50:52] don't want to lose it
[50:54] but sometimes we have to be willing to
[50:57] give it up
[51:01] though
[51:03] matthew's uh 19 and 21
[51:06] matthew 19 and 21
[51:09] thank god for
[51:11] jesus
[51:12] christ amen
[51:16] some things that really come across my
[51:18] heart
[51:19] and
[51:20] 19 and 21
[51:22] and we think about the young rich ruler
[51:25] the young man was young and rich and it
[51:29] was a ruler
[51:30] and i know we heard it many times and
[51:32] sometimes
[51:34] just said too many times
[51:36] it becomes repetitious but amen i don't
[51:39] want to say it
[51:41] i want to say it where it can resonate
[51:44] where it means something to somebody
[51:47] somebody amen amen maybe it's the time
[51:51] in the season for you to hear and
[51:53] understand what god is saying
[51:56] because sometimes it it you it's sad for
[51:59] somebody else but sometimes it's your
[52:01] time to hear just say it to you
[52:05] they meant the young man was young and
[52:07] he was rich and he was a ruler but look
[52:09] at
[52:10] um here at um
[52:13] 19 and 21 it says
[52:19] in the 21st
[52:20] the young man said in him
[52:23] all these things he talked about keeping
[52:25] the command but all these things that
[52:27] were kept from my youth jesus said unto
[52:29] him if thou would be what
[52:32] if that would be perfect gold and what
[52:36] see sometimes when it comes to selling
[52:39] out
[52:40] amen we got too much to lose we got i i
[52:44] i you know i got a lot here so
[52:47] that i got to consider
[52:48] sometimes in our youth amen
[52:52] it blinds us sometimes
[52:54] our youth sometimes
[52:57] amen it makes us confident that we got
[53:00] time on our side we can wait till
[53:03] tomorrow amen because we amen i got
[53:07] things amen that we want to do
[53:11] places we want to go
[53:13] amen experiencing in life
[53:16] but this young man amen recognized in
[53:19] all amen his richness and all amen
[53:23] his rulers and everything he had he
[53:26] realized that he was missing something
[53:29] they meant the young man probably had a
[53:30] you know a better life than most of us
[53:32] he probably had the best car he probably
[53:35] had money amen and he had he had his own
[53:39] business and everything he he was all
[53:41] right amen he had it all going for him
[53:44] and he was a church-going boy
[53:46] because he said when it comes down to
[53:48] commandments i kept all this from my
[53:50] youth up i'm a good fellow amen i'm not
[53:53] like those out there in the street and
[53:55] they meant thugging and
[53:58] trying to do this and that and
[54:00] and i'm not like that amen are you with
[54:03] me
[54:05] but he had too much to lose
[54:08] sometimes what we holding on to amen we
[54:12] don't want to give it up
[54:14] amen because amen it means more to us
[54:18] you see he asked jesus what must i do
[54:20] that i might inherit eternal life i want
[54:23] to know what i because it's something i
[54:26] i don't have that i i kept the
[54:28] commandment i go to church and i i i'm a
[54:32] ruler i'm successful but i don't have
[54:35] what i know you god
[54:39] and i want it
[54:41] amen it ought to be something amen that
[54:44] you possess that others won't
[54:46] amen i got something that amen that you
[54:50] know amen it's real i got something
[54:53] that's genuine i got something amen amen
[54:57] praise god you got to possess something
[55:00] pray man you got to you got to be the
[55:03] salt of the earth amen that amen men
[55:06] amen want some of that
[55:08] you got to be the lights of the world
[55:11] that men can see jesus
[55:13] well i wanted to talk this morning one
[55:16] time if i be lifted up there must be a
[55:18] standard jesus said if i be lifted up
[55:22] hey i'll draw man
[55:25] i'm telling you if you're going to lift
[55:26] anybody up you got to lift jesus up
[55:29] amen if you're going to exalt anybody it
[55:31] ought to be
[55:32] jesus amen praise god you ought to lift
[55:36] jesus up
[55:39] so by the grace of god
[55:41] here in the
[55:43] 25th verse jesus
[55:46] go and sell
[55:49] that thou has
[55:50] how many willing to do that this morning
[55:53] amen praise god and i want to
[55:56] you see
[55:57] it was a challenge to me
[56:00] this morning amen because what folks
[56:02] holding on to is not helping them
[56:07] amen it's not getting you where you need
[56:09] to be
[56:11] amen it's not causing you amen to have
[56:14] the peace and joy that only god can give
[56:17] you
[56:19] amen
[56:20] amen they can't amen hallelujah we need
[56:24] a life-changing experience
[56:26] we need certain amen that we can hack
[56:28] our soul though
[56:30] we need something amen oh god nothing in
[56:33] this world matters
[56:35] because i see beyond
[56:37] praise god this life
[56:39] amen i see a kingdom
[56:43] amen
[56:45] because
[56:46] i'ma tell you
[56:48] you know i i wrote down some things that
[56:51] would cause people to not want to sell
[56:53] out
[56:54] praise god
[56:56] and those things i wrote down
[56:59] what are you holding on to
[57:01] give it up and let it go
[57:04] praise god
[57:07] and sometimes you're holding on to your
[57:08] hurt
[57:12] you're holding on to your pains
[57:17] you're holding on
[57:19] to your failures
[57:22] your disappointments
[57:26] holding on to
[57:28] amen
[57:30] you know
[57:31] wife husbands
[57:34] i'm not talking about holding on to him
[57:35] in a good manner sometimes the wife has
[57:38] walked out sometimes the husband has
[57:39] walked out sometimes amen parents are
[57:42] not there for you
[57:45] are you up man
[57:47] sometimes amen
[57:49] that is not there sometimes mama is not
[57:51] there sometimes the thing that you need
[57:53] is not that for you
[57:59] so you you hold on to
[58:01] something that you ought to forgive for
[58:05] it's unforgiveness sometimes somebody
[58:07] injured you sometimes somebody that amen
[58:11] has caused damage in your life and
[58:13] sometimes you can't amen you can't seem
[58:15] to let go of
[58:17] of what they've done and and
[58:20] sometimes you we ourselves have done
[58:23] things they meant that the devil still
[58:25] accuses of
[58:30] and the devil still bring those things
[58:32] back to keep us from going forward
[58:34] sometimes we count our lives unworthy we
[58:36] count ourselves unworthy of the kingdom
[58:38] sometimes we look at ourselves and the
[58:41] devil will bring the guilt and amen
[58:43] bring the amen to sorrow back to you
[58:46] amen that he won't let you go free
[58:50] because
[58:52] you seem like well god forgive me can i
[58:55] pray
[58:56] can i pray in the state that i'm in
[58:59] can i get a prayer through in the
[59:01] condition that i'm in god what is going
[59:03] on with me amen god i need your help
[59:07] amen but i don't feel like god can hear
[59:10] me because i don't feel worthy
[59:13] he meant so how can god hear somebody
[59:16] like me
[59:18] will god speak to me
[59:21] amen god sighs something to me
[59:24] i want to know that
[59:27] praise god you're there for me
[59:30] that you can hear me
[59:33] sometimes we go through those states
[59:35] amen that we have to forgive others then
[59:37] we have to forgive ourselves we have to
[59:40] amend to let go of the hurt let go of
[59:43] the pain let go of the disappointment
[59:45] let go of the failure let go and let god
[59:51] sometimes we hold to that and
[59:53] we live a life of that condition amen
[59:56] because of what we have experienced in
[59:58] our lives and we want everybody to uh
[1:00:02] circle around us and encourage us and
[1:00:04] keep us encouraged it meant that we can
[1:00:06] go forward amen but amen because we
[1:00:09] don't get to rally and the support that
[1:00:12] we think that we need and we have to
[1:00:13] have in order amen to go forth in life
[1:00:17] sometimes we give up
[1:00:20] we give up on life
[1:00:23] because life is not serving amen
[1:00:26] and meeting in my my needs and sometimes
[1:00:29] we look for a church we look for a
[1:00:31] preacher we look for somebody that can
[1:00:34] understand
[1:00:35] praise god and sometimes the spirit
[1:00:38] that's in us that won't that we won't
[1:00:40] let go sometimes focus or protect us
[1:00:43] because they don't understand
[1:00:46] praise god sometimes people are riding
[1:00:48] around and support some spirit that you
[1:00:51] need to let go
[1:00:54] praise god they'll compromise with you
[1:00:57] and tell you it's going to be all right
[1:00:59] it's not going to be all right until you
[1:01:02] forgive
[1:01:06] yourself and others
[1:01:09] even if they had done you wrong
[1:01:13] are you with me
[1:01:14] you got to forgive them and just let it
[1:01:17] go
[1:01:18] are you with me
[1:01:20] for you to be free
[1:01:22] are you with me
[1:01:31] some for
[1:01:32] let go of your pride because that's a
[1:01:35] big hindrance to us
[1:01:37] our pride that
[1:01:39] we don't want to sell out to our pride
[1:01:42] praise god we ge sometimes
[1:01:45] it comes difficult for men to let go of
[1:01:48] their pride because they want to
[1:01:50] maintain that i'm a man
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:55] and sometimes
[1:01:57] uh women amen they they they they feel
[1:02:00] like
[1:02:01] that i i'm weak and i i i'm dependent i
[1:02:05] need somebody
[1:02:09] and then sometimes the brothers feel
[1:02:11] like i don't need nobody
[1:02:16] because i can do it on my own
[1:02:20] are you with me
[1:02:22] so it's easy for
[1:02:24] sisters to get saved and it is for
[1:02:26] brothers to get saved
[1:02:28] because they understand that amen i need
[1:02:31] somebody i need god
[1:02:34] but brothers want to be independent and
[1:02:37] macho and big in somebody amen they
[1:02:40] don't want to humble themselves
[1:02:44] oh god help us
[1:02:50] let me just try to read this and
[1:02:53] and just to put some scripture with what
[1:02:54] we're saying okay
[1:02:57] he says
[1:02:59] and go sell that what i have and give to
[1:03:02] the poor
[1:03:03] praise god
[1:03:05] tell me how hard did i work
[1:03:08] i was going back to my life as a young
[1:03:11] man

[1:04:47] really wait on the law
[1:04:49] when folk giving you good advice
[1:04:52] and sound advice
[1:04:55] you got to listen sometime

[1:05:37] things that i've been through
[1:05:40] are you a man
[1:05:42] so so brother and sister i i i'm saying
[1:05:46] but one thing i can
[1:05:48] value
[1:05:50] i can value
[1:05:52] amen that i walked off from the job
[1:05:57] not knowing where i was going
[1:06:01] giving it up
[1:06:03] i think i was the first black orthopedic
[1:06:06] technician at that hospital
[1:06:10] and so
[1:06:12] i walked off
[1:06:16] and when i walked off i didn't know
[1:06:18] i'm on the corner preaching
[1:06:21] knocking doors
[1:06:24] all of a sudden we rented a little
[1:06:26] building and i started baptizing elderly
[1:06:29] people for
[1:06:30] people that was in wheelchairs and the
[1:06:32] poor in the needy
[1:06:35] looked like i had a senior citizen
[1:06:36] church
[1:06:38] in wheelchairs pushing them
[1:06:41] you know
[1:06:42] i had a senior citizen church
[1:06:46] and uh
[1:06:47] the people that were down and out in the
[1:06:49] city
[1:06:50] that i went to
[1:06:52] as soon as i helped
[1:06:54] the people
[1:06:56] their children come back to see about
[1:06:58] them then
[1:06:59] you got to go to our church because mama
[1:07:01] was buried in this graveyard and if you
[1:07:04] don't come to the church with us they
[1:07:06] wasn't going to church nowhere but
[1:07:08] you're going to our church because you
[1:07:09] got to be buried in the graveyard
[1:07:12] you see what i'm saying so it's all kind
[1:07:14] of things but the thing is that
[1:07:18] the point is
[1:07:19] that
[1:07:20] somewhere in your life you got to come
[1:07:22] to a place that you're willing to sell
[1:07:24] out
[1:07:26] and leave it all
[1:07:29] i'm talking about not when i just came
[1:07:31] out of the world and i had to leave amen

[1:07:36] everything that i had what my
[1:07:39] football and everything just walked off
[1:07:43] walked off the field that's it
[1:07:47] because god was calling me
[1:07:50] are you with me
[1:07:51] there's many times in our life that god
[1:07:54] gives us calls and god asks us to sell
[1:07:57] out at different periods of our life
[1:08:00] that god come back and he asks you the
[1:08:02] same thing i want you to sell
[1:08:10] different stages of our lives
[1:08:13] god comes back to the same thing are you
[1:08:15] willing to sell it all
[1:08:18] are you willing to give up all
[1:08:23] different points in our lives just when
[1:08:25] we thought we gave it up all and and
[1:08:28] we've come to follow him then god comes
[1:08:30] back to us again amen because we've oh
[1:08:33] we forgot
[1:08:38] i gotta go

[1:08:42] preach in a little while
[1:08:44] again

[1:08:49] i wrote down
[1:08:50] you know
[1:08:52] folks will try to stop you and then try
[1:08:54] to block you
[1:08:57] when god starts speaking to your heart
[1:09:04] folks
[1:09:07] you you'll be surprised who those folks
[1:09:09] would be to try to block you and stop
[1:09:12] you
[1:09:23] see
[1:09:24] i dealt with
[1:09:28] the product of son
[1:09:30] in luke 15 he says
[1:09:36] i'm coming back home i'm going home
[1:09:40] and on this trip back home
[1:09:44] when he got back home
[1:09:46] i'm just closing early
[1:09:49] because i i got scriptures that i need
[1:09:51] to go through but i'm not gonna go
[1:09:53] through it
[1:09:54] he said i'm going back home
[1:09:58] see the the prodigal son he got all that
[1:10:01] was belonging to him of his father and
[1:10:03] he went out
[1:10:05] went out in the street and went out in
[1:10:07] the world and he he he he lived it up
[1:10:10] spent all that his father gave him
[1:10:15] find himself in bad shape
[1:10:18] in a place that he thought he'd never be
[1:10:21] being the jew he wouldn't have nothing
[1:10:23] to do with a swine a pig
[1:10:26] a hog
[1:10:27] unclean animal not only did he find
[1:10:31] himself in the hall of pen with the slap
[1:10:34] he wanted to eat it because he was
[1:10:35] hungry
[1:10:39] brother and sister sometimes the slop
[1:10:41] that the devil tried to feed us
[1:10:45] praise god i said it slopped
[1:10:50] cigarette smoking
[1:10:53] refilled
[1:10:54] puffing
[1:10:57] alcoholism
[1:11:00] slop
[1:11:05] the devil would ask you to eat slap that
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:11] slop
[1:11:12] i can tell some things but i'm not going
[1:11:14] to hit too many things
[1:11:16] but it's a lot of slop
[1:11:18] that the devil would have you eat
[1:11:22] praise god
[1:11:24] but look where you were look what you
[1:11:26] left for slop
[1:11:30] as long as you was on top of your game
[1:11:32] everything was all right
[1:11:34] but you won't always be on the top
[1:11:36] sometimes you're going to get down to
[1:11:38] the bottom
[1:11:40] that's the place god can meet you
[1:11:43] praise god god don't meet us on the top
[1:11:46] god meets us when we're humble when
[1:11:47] we're broken
[1:11:50] god got to amen break us down to help us
[1:11:55] you know some folks will block you won't
[1:11:57] we'll let you get help
[1:12:00] they ain't gonna let you get help
[1:12:01] because amen they telling you you all
[1:12:03] right when you know you're not
[1:12:08] some folks are telling you you have to
[1:12:10] go through
[1:12:11] your shame and you have to go through
[1:12:13] your pain
[1:12:16] when god trying to get you out of that
[1:12:18] hog pin
[1:12:20] payment but it's up to you to come to
[1:12:23] yourself
[1:12:25] how do you come to yourself god comes to
[1:12:27] you
[1:12:29] you can't get to him but he comes to you
[1:12:33] i believe that god came into that mind
[1:12:36] of that young man and he realized this
[1:12:38] is what i left

[1:12:43] this is where i left my father's house

[1:13:33] that serving the lord don't know how to
[1:13:35] receive folks that are in bad shape
[1:13:39] when they come
[1:13:42] sometimes church folks got so good

[1:13:46] that they don't know how to celebrate
[1:13:49] when somebody coming home
[1:13:52] are you with me
