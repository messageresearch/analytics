[39:52] your hand may God bless to the reading
[39:54] of his word tonight by the grace of God
[39:57] we want to minister on a little short
[39:59] topic amen and I I entitled it
[40:01] sacrifices and offerings amen sacrifices
[40:04] and offerings you know here we finding
[40:07] that you know the people they were they
[40:10] were giving something to God as we said
[40:13] they were giving the offering to God but
[40:16] it wasn't what God was God wasn't
[40:17] accepting it was he one thing one thing
[40:20] they had lost and I I was seeing here in
[40:23] the sixth verse one thing they had lost
[40:25] he says if I if I'm a father where is my
[40:27] honor right and he says if I'm a master
[40:30] where is my fear right because the
[40:34] people had stopped fearing God right and
[40:37] that that was in that time and I believe
[40:39] we live in a time right now where the
[40:41] people don't fear God no more you know
[40:43] my grandmother used to say uh something
[40:46] all the time she say a man that don't
[40:48] fear God or do anything amen and that
[40:50] that's to be the truth cuz he don't fear
[40:52] God right but we find that that's the
[40:55] hour that we live in today how many
[40:57] believe that but I says that you know
[41:00] sacrifice and offerings you know you can
[41:03] you can be making a sacrifice but just
[41:05] cuz you making a sacrifice that don't
[41:06] make it God's will that's right come on
[41:09] you know it's it's a thing it's
[41:11] something about you know God's will you
[41:13] can be in his perfect will or his
[41:15] permissive will or sometimes just not
[41:18] even in his will altogether right but we
[41:21] find that in God's perfect will that's
[41:23] the place that you and I want to be at
[41:25] you know in the permissive will you'll
[41:27] suffer for some things won't you come on
[41:30] God might allow some things but look at
[41:32] the aftermath of what God of the thing
[41:35] and that's what sometimes you know
[41:37] individuals in their heart you know they
[41:39] they like like I was saying the other
[41:41] day they have a a buzzer or something go
[41:43] off to let them know that what you doing
[41:45] ain't right right or what you about to
[41:47] do leave it alone right but they go past
[41:50] all the buzzles all the stop signs and
[41:52] all they run those things over and they
[41:55] go and do it anyway right and sometimes
[41:57] God God allow permit it you know he want
[42:00] destroy you right there but you going to
[42:02] suffer for those things come on and
[42:04] sometimes people look at it and they say
[42:06] well I'll just do it and I'll just
[42:07] suffer but I want to say one thing when
[42:10] God get done with you come on sometimes
[42:14] people think that they they can bear but
[42:16] when God get done with you you wish
[42:18] today you had never done that you know I
[42:21] thinking about once in uh scriptures
[42:24] David and and Bash Sheba and how you
[42:26] know was caught up in the flesh and done
[42:28] those things we would say oh that was
[42:30] God's you know perfect will for Solomon
[42:33] to come and then you know you can say it
[42:35] was God permission will that he allowed
[42:36] it but look at the aftermath of it come
[42:40] on the aftermath of it was bad so
[42:43] sometimes people compare themselves to
[42:45] certain sins like that but you don't
[42:48] want to do that Hallelujah no at all at
[42:50] all cause at all times you want to be in
[42:53] God's perfect will I don't know about
[42:55] you but I want to be in God's perfect
[42:56] will
[42:57] at all times you know what happens is
[43:00] God's perfect will for your life a lot
[43:02] of times it doesn't agree with what your
[43:04] flesh want come on it ain't going to be
[43:07] what the flesh want right that's what it
[43:10] is the way this road to to to Heaven it
[43:12] ain't no it ain't no Cakewalk come on
[43:14] people want to get there without no
[43:16] cross without a cross but he says you
[43:18] know any man that come after me got to
[43:20] First deny him what self take up his
[43:23] what cross and follow me you know we
[43:26] here on this Earth we got to Bear a
[43:27] cross right no it's blessings in the
[43:29] cross but I'm going say you ain't
[43:31] getting you ain't walking that straight
[43:32] and that narrow way without a cross but
[43:35] so many people run from that cross don't
[43:37] they come on but like I said the other
[43:40] day should Jesus bear the cross Alone
[43:42] come on but we find that like it says
[43:45] sacrifice and offerings God had a
[43:47] problem with their with their offerings
[43:49] and their sacrifice didn't he come on
[43:52] they they it's not that they wasn't
[43:54] giving one but the one that they was
[43:55] giving God had a problem with it didn't
[43:57] he come on and I thinking today I said
[44:00] you know God got a problem today with
[44:03] sacrifice of the people you know God
[44:05] only permit I believe God only put up
[44:06] with stuff so long right then after a
[44:10] while God ain't putting up with it no
[44:12] more I believe that come on you know
[44:15] that's why you know we we weigh our own
[44:17] actions right sometimes we can say well
[44:20] you know uh oh this person been through
[44:23] that and been through this and and that
[44:25] may be true but that doesn't necessarily
[44:28] mean just because you've been through
[44:29] something you get out the will of God
[44:31] right come on God permit things for a
[44:33] certain amount of time but what it is
[44:35] the trial and the tribulations you go
[44:37] through should not take you away from
[44:39] God that's right it should draw you
[44:41] closer to God if it took you away from
[44:44] God and something wasn't right from the
[44:45] very beginning but when the hardest the
[44:48] things come it should draw you even that
[44:50] much closer to God come on y'all believe
[44:53] that but what happens a lot of times
[44:55] many times people go through things and
[44:57] it draw them further away from God right
[45:00] they begin to doubt in God but you know
[45:02] one thing about job and all that he was
[45:04] going through he said the Lord give and
[45:05] he take away every every trial job went
[45:08] through it looked like it drew him
[45:09] closer to God right come on because the
[45:12] thing is you know that you got to you
[45:15] ever come to that point in your life and
[45:17] I know I have all the time that God is
[45:20] my only hope and salvation amen come on
[45:23] when things falling apart if I if I draw
[45:26] away from him or he draws away from me
[45:29] then that's like what else what else do
[45:30] I have I have no other options but God
[45:34] right come on though he slay me yet I'll
[45:36] trust him I have no other options he's
[45:39] the only he's the only option that I
[45:41] have that I know that's going to be sure
[45:43] every time come on things everything
[45:45] else will fail but it's one thing I know
[45:47] that'll be sure every time yes and
[45:51] that's the Lord he gonna be sure every
[45:52] time come on he's gonna be solid like
[45:56] they say he going to be on your side he
[45:58] going to be solid every time even those
[46:00] times in those times where it seems like
[46:02] he's silent don't you know God is still
[46:05] working he's still working he's still
[46:07] moving I believe that Hallelujah come on
[46:10] but we find that what happens today like
[46:12] he says uh uh uh if I be a father
[46:15] where's my honor people don't honor God
[46:17] do they come on they don't honor him
[46:20] sometimes when they when they got it all
[46:22] think they healthy think they strong
[46:24] think they they all right they don't
[46:25] honor God right
[46:27] and God knows it that arrogant Spirit
[46:30] don't he he knows that people walk
[46:33] around with it don't they come on
[46:35] because and they what it is you know God
[46:38] God dwells in humility that's where he
[46:41] dwells at Hallelujah and that's
[46:43] something that we can't put on ourselves
[46:45] but we got to get lay before God and ask
[46:48] God to give us that Spirit of humility
[46:50] right to be able to walk before him
[46:52] because when he blessing you how easy it
[46:55] is when God blessing you to walk on the
[46:57] rooftop and say look at what all I've
[46:59] done right come on how easy it is to
[47:02] look out over the kingdom and look look
[47:04] at what all I've done right because God
[47:07] is blessing you but you want to stay in
[47:10] that place to where you know where your
[47:11] blessings come from come on God you want
[47:15] to stay in that place that where you
[47:16] walking and say Lord I know where my
[47:18] help come from Lord all my help come
[47:20] from you come on Lord thank you for what
[47:23] I got thank you what for what I don't
[47:25] have because you didn't need want me to
[47:27] have it Anyway come on but God no matter
[47:30] what let me walk humbly before you
[47:32] because I know one thing that these
[47:33] things are temporal right things can
[47:36] tomorrow they can take everything
[47:38] whatever you can have you can be lost
[47:40] tomorrow right laws change you lose your
[47:42] job everything tomorrow right then what
[47:44] does it you put your trust in those
[47:46] things but if you stir up Hallelujah
[47:49] where your heart is there where your
[47:50] treasure be I don't know about you but
[47:53] my heart is in the word hallelujah come
[47:55] on in the word of God
[47:57] not in church now come on not in a group
[48:00] but my heart is in God's word come on
[48:03] because that's where the that's where my
[48:05] treasure is that's where my hope
[48:08] Hallelujah lies in the word of God I
[48:11] believe that come on and you got to
[48:13] esteem that more than your necessary
[48:16] meat that's right come on you got to
[48:17] realize that everything you need or
[48:20] everything that that you can obtain good
[48:23] in this life you got to realize that
[48:25] it's locked up in this word hallelujah
[48:27] amen come on that you can draw from God
[48:29] that's what it is people thinking that
[48:31] they drawing from their job drawing from
[48:33] Money drawing all things but but those
[48:35] things will fail but when you drawing
[48:37] from that living well come on when you
[48:40] drinking from that living water that
[48:42] won't fail that's why when Things Fall
[48:45] Apart job lose whatever happens in your
[48:47] life people walk away from you come on
[48:50] situations change you still drawing from
[48:52] that well come on and that well won't
[48:55] run dry Hallelujah
[48:57] that well will give you Joy in the

[51:34] when you talking about uh uh uh uh
[51:37] sacrifice and offerings a lot of times
[51:39] people talk about tithes and things
[51:41] right but I says one thing about it a
[51:43] lot of times people struggle right with
[51:47] that 10% don't
[51:48] they God bless you with so much and all
[51:52] he asking for is 10 right and people
[51:55] struggle with it right

[52:01] down come on pipe going to bust under
[52:03] the house all kind of things going to
[52:05] happen right but what it is you curse
[52:08] yourself with a what curse didn't you
[52:11] that's the word of God ain't it come on
[52:13] but people oh that area is hard right
[52:15] but the thing about it is God want to
[52:17] bless you how many believe God want to
[52:19] bless them tonight come on God want to
[52:22] bless you Hallelujah he don't want you
[52:26] to be Cur curse but sometime you got no

[52:33] blessings of God where I fa to Lord help
[52:36] me to get back on the right Road
[52:38] Hallelujah that's what I desire tonight
[52:40] but I said sacrifice and offerings what
[52:42] it is a lot of
[52:44] times you know when you talking about
[52:48] sacrifices people make sacrifices right
[52:52] but just because you making a sacrifice
[52:54] that don't mean that's what God want
[52:57] a lot of times you make
[52:59] sacrifices in the name of the Lord but
[53:01] you want it do it because it's your own
[53:03] benefit right y'all believe that people
[53:06] do it I'm making this sacrifice but in
[53:08] your heart you doing it because you you
[53:10] want to benefit something right come on
[53:14] and God know that God can see one thing
[53:16] about God we can play we can pull the
[53:19] the cover over everybody but not God
[53:21] that's one person one person you God
[53:23] looking God looking at it just like how
[53:25] it is naked open right come
[53:28] on but you know I I says we want to make
[53:33] sacrifices but but it not being in God's
[53:36] will but but just cuz you make a
[53:38] sacrifice that don't mean God got
[53:40] accepted but the problem today is people
[53:43] make sacrifices and they they tell God
[53:45] what he need to accept come
[53:49] on and then God say and accept it then
[53:52] they get
[53:52] upset don't they I did all this and I
[53:55] did all that but that ain't what God
[53:57] wanted come on God know what he want yes
[54:02] and you know what God want Hallelujah
[54:04] God want his word don't he he says he
[54:07] says does the Lord Delight in sacrifices
[54:10] and offerings come on rather than
[54:12] obeying the voice of God
[54:15] right Hallelujah come on somebody say
[54:17] Amen tonight come on
[54:20] now the hearken come on it's better
[54:23] ain't it ain't that the Bible come on
[54:26] but we got a problem today with people
[54:27] obeying God's word ain't it come on
[54:30] that's what you know we we find that all
[54:32] over the place don't you people want to
[54:35] give sacrifice they want to give God
[54:37] what they want and think he ought to
[54:38] accept it I thought about Cain Cain he
[54:41] gave God he made a sacrifice it wasn't
[54:44] that he didn't make one he made one
[54:46] didn't he but it wasn't what God
[54:50] wanted but Abel he made one Hallelujah
[54:53] and God can smile on him I can see God
[54:56] tell Cain you see that that that's what
[54:58] I love Hallelujah you do what your
[55:01] brother doing and I accept you ain't
[55:02] that what God told him but instead of
[55:04] him giving God what he want Hallelujah
[55:09] instead of him giving God what God
[55:10] wanted he got mad with his brother I
[55:13] want to give him what I want to give him
[55:14] right but God wasn't accepting that was
[55:17] he and that's what happens today God
[55:20] bless people hallelujah because they
[55:22] giving God what he want and God tell you
[55:25] come on you got to give me more your
[55:26] time more your time in prayer Hallelujah
[55:30] more your time in sincerity you got to
[55:32] give me more and I'll bless you people

[1:01:09] contest in the
[1:01:11] church say the brothers Brothers was
[1:01:14] coming up by the altar in their suits
[1:01:17] and they was I guess judging who the
[1:01:19] best dressed brother
[1:01:20] was in
[1:01:22] church I said
[1:01:24] no the like the prophet of God was
[1:01:26] saying he was saying it took the the the
[1:01:29] the Catholic Church A Thousand Years
[1:01:32] 2,000 years to get in the shape that
[1:01:33] it's saying he says but at the rate the
[1:01:36] Pentecost and all going the day he says
[1:01:38] it'll take way less than that because of
[1:01:41] the drifting right but you think
[1:01:45] sometimes you say what what what if you
[1:01:47] know Jesus he's sitting there Jesus
[1:01:49] sitting there looking at that going on

[1:02:45] the evening when I get up I hear God
[1:02:48] hallelujah come on but I says that what
[1:02:50] it is the people of that day I don't
[1:02:53] want to be long the people of that day
[1:02:54] they was giving God and that's that's
[1:02:55] what he said you polluted my altar right

[1:02:59] going on doing their sacrifices and
[1:03:02] offerings and thing but look how it
[1:03:04] looked to God it was filthy wasn't it
