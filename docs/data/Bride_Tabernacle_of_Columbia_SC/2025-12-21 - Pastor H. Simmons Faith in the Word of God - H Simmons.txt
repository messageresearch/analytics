Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for and what evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; Okay. God bless the reader word. You may be seated. Want to talk about having faith in the word of God. Now, faith is what? It says now. Faith is now. Look at somebody. Tell them faith is &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; He said now. Faith is &gt;&gt; now. Not tomorrow, but now. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Present tense now. &gt;&gt; Right now. &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; We said faith has power. Amen. The power of faith. He said if you have faith, you can say to the mountain. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; If faith can move a mountain, faith can meet your needs this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Substance of things hoped for and evidence of things not seen. Okay, let's repeat it. Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. One more time. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. Got it. How many of you learned it? Tell me y'all didn't I said Sunday morning y'all supposed to know it. Okay, one more time. Maybe y'all get it. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for and evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's very important. Amen. That now faith is Okay. &gt;&gt; So, we were talking about faith in the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason why we said faith in the word of God. Now uh go back to uh where we were talking uh concerning Romans 10. Faith come by hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] So faith come if faith come by hearing and hear the word of God. It said, "How then shall they they call on him?" The 14th verse of Romans 10 and 14. How shall they? How then shall they call on him whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him whom they have not what? And how shall they hear without a what? &gt;&gt; Preacher. &gt;&gt; Preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just read on. For now, for how shall they preach except they be what? &gt;&gt; As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them which preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things. But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah or Eel said, Lord, who has what? &gt;&gt; Believe our report. &gt;&gt; So then what? &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; So you got another scripture you going you're going to remember. Romans 10:17. So then faith cometh by what? &gt;&gt; Hearing. and hearing what? &gt;&gt; By the word of God. &gt;&gt; Faith in the word of God. Now, how can you hear without a preacher? And how can he preach God sent him? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of people preaching, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if God sent them, they're going to speak God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. They not they're not they're not being dictated to by man, but they're going to preach God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, uh, a lot of people have been called by the church. &gt;&gt; They've been called by a denomination. But if God called them and God sent them, they're going to preach the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Preach the word. Preach it in season, out of season." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Another, it's very important. I I won't read that, but maybe we will. Let's just go to Deuter Romans 8. God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's It's holiday time and people taking their holiday off, &gt;&gt; but thank God you're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. I'm so glad I'm here. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus. Are you glad to be here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm in the number. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You said uh Deuter Romans 8. I hope Kale with me. He said, go ahead on. I'll let you do some reading. Okay. 8 and one. All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers. And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these 40 years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no. See, God, they went through the wilderness for 40 years, and God wanted to see whether or not you going to keep his commandments. And he wanted to humble you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes things come in our lives, and God is trying to get our attention, trying to get us to be humble enough, amen, to recognize what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, cuz sometime we don't know how good God is and what where God, you know, he he bought us a long way, but sometime we don't recognize and give him thanks for what he done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we need to thank God for bringing us through another year. &gt;&gt; Thank him. Amen. Because this is the this is THIS IS WHAT GOD has done for us. And if HE KEPT YOU WELL AND KEPT YOU IN your right mind, you ought to be ABLE TO SAY, "LORD, I THANK YOU for another year." &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. YOU'VE BEEN GOOD TO ME, LORD. &gt;&gt; YOU ALLOWED ME TO SEE ANOTHER YEAR. &gt;&gt; And you kept me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "He didn't have to do it, but he did." And I'm so glad he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm glad not to be in pain this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

I'd rather go get it pulled than me having a toothache. [laughter] But by the grace of God, but but th those pains that I've been in for a couple of weeks, it seems like I'd rather have a toothache than to go through those pains. But by the grace of God, God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can stand here and say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I I didn't get upset with God.

A and God took care of them. And God takes care of you if you only let him. If you let go and let God have his way in your life. See, sometimes we're holding on to like we we don't want to lose control. You know what? We get on the airplane and is way up in the air and you know what the pilot do? Put it on what? &gt;&gt; Autopilot. He had he let go and you sat in there and you know and now we got these cars and Caleb used to like to do and going down the highway. He take his hand off the steering wheel just let let it ride. I said man man what you doing man what you got to do something he said no here it go stay in line. You know, some of us are afraid to let go in it. And I said, "Man, go on. Tell you how to get that wheel. You gonna run this car, man. Hold on." He said, "Man, [laughter] it'll be all right. Daddy, it going to be all right. The car going to go." Praise God. But some of us afraid to get in one of those cars, sit back and relax and say, "I want to go so and so." Huh?

But if they can trust the automatic pilot in the sky, how about you trusting God with your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you willing to let go and let God be in control? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have faith in God's word and say, "Lord, Amen. I have faith and confidence in your word and I'm letting go. I'mma let your word work it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can take me to my destination where I need to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. WHERE YOU WANT ME TO GO, lead me, LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN.
