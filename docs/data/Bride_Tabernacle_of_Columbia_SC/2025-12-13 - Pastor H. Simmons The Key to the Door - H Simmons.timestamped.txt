[34:54] sayest, I'm rich and increased with
[34:56] goods, and have neither nothing.
[35:00] and knowest not that thou are wretched,
[35:03] miserable, and poor, and blind, and
[35:08] naked.
[35:09] I cancel thee to bow me gold tried in
[35:13] the fire that thou may be rich and that
[35:19] and
[35:22] white remnant that thou may be clothed
[35:25] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[35:28] not appear and anoint thy eyes with
[35:31] thyself that thou may see. As many as I
[35:35] love I rebuke and chasen. Beious
[35:38] therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at
[35:42] the door and knock. If any man hear my
[35:46] voice and open the door, I would come in
[35:49] unto him and I would suck with him and
[35:54] he with me. God bless you. Read his
[35:56] word. You may receive.
[36:00] I said, I probably got the heat all the
[36:02] way up. It's burning up up here. I know
[36:05] Gordon was hot.
[36:12] But y'all feel comfortable out there,
[36:13] don't you?
[36:18] But you still can turn it over on that
[36:21] side.
[36:28] But by the grace of God, uh,
[36:33] the key to the door, the key to the
[36:36] door.
[36:39] And I know as we look in the book of
[36:42] Revelation, we know that Christ on the
[36:44] outside of the church knocking on the
[36:46] door. But we want to deal with the
[36:48] individual,
[36:49] you and I, as Christ knocks on the door.
[36:53] And we want to look at it as
[36:57] Christ being the the door, the key to
[37:00] the door.
[37:02] And
[37:04] we know the key to the door is faith.
[37:08] We use the key to lock or to unlock.
[37:14] Are you with me? Amen.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; But
[37:18] as God's servant said,
[37:22] the church has lost the key.
[37:25] The church has lost the key. Faith is
[37:28] the key, but the church has lost the
[37:30] key. And as a whole, we see things are
[37:35] not happening in folks lives because
[37:38] they have lost the key. And faith is the
[37:42] key that unlocks the door. Are you with
[37:46] me?
[37:50] &gt;&gt; We're living in an age where
[37:54] people are trying to believe. They're
[37:56] trying to say, "I believe God."
[38:00] And they're trying to do all they can
[38:02] do. As I said in Mullins last night,
[38:05] they people say, "Well, I said, "Who
[38:08] want to be saved?" And if the sermon or
[38:10] the anointing is kind of high, you'll
[38:14] find people that's been saved 20, 30
[38:17] years, raise their hand
[38:19] because they want to be saved. They want
[38:22] to give your life to the Lord. They want
[38:24] to give their life. Maybe things are
[38:26] just not right
[38:29] or happening and they're not where they
[38:31] want to be or they need to be in the
[38:33] Lord. So they raise their hand because
[38:35] they come under some type of conviction.
[38:39] You know, I I feel I feel compelled just
[38:41] to lift my hand cuz I I but you know it
[38:46] it it it's time that we don't raise our
[38:49] hand to uh uh to accept the Lord because
[38:52] if we done that, we don't need to
[38:54] continue continue accepting him. We need
[38:57] to believe
[38:59] that we have received.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; True. Amen. Are you with me?
[39:04] &gt;&gt; And we need to praise him for saving us.
[39:09] And I believe that's the key. Sometimes
[39:13] we don't praise him and thank him enough
[39:15] from saving us.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; And if you keep on thanking the Lord for
[39:20] saving you, you won't be doubting your
[39:24] salvation.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; But you begin to praise the Lord, I
[39:28] thank you for saving me.
[39:31] You know, if you get baptized in water
[39:33] in the name of Jesus Christ, you know,
[39:35] the people used to have to get up and
[39:37] where we came from and they would say,
[39:39] "Thank the Lord. I praise the Lord. I've
[39:41] been baptized in according to Acts 2:38
[39:44] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[39:46] remission of my sin." And then went and
[39:49] spoke with tongues and evidence. You
[39:51] know what I'm saying? But, you know, it
[39:53] was a it was a repetitious thing. every
[39:56] prayer pray praise service they get up
[39:59] and they said and you got to say you've
[40:01] been baptized in Jesus Christ's name
[40:03] according to Acts 2:38 if you didn't say
[40:05] that something is missing
[40:08] okay but by the grace of God
[40:11] I find that we must meditate on the word
[40:15] we must speak faith
[40:17] we must speak the word we must say it is
[40:21] very important that you said you tell
[40:23] God thank you for saving and you get up
[40:25] in the morning. Praise the Lord. Lord,
[40:27] thank you for another day. Thank you for
[40:29] saving me. Lord, thank you for filling
[40:31] me with the Holy Ghost. Lord, thank you.
[40:33] Amen.
[40:35] [clears throat]
[40:35] &gt;&gt; But failure to express it.
[40:39] And that's what happens many time.
[40:42] People don't express [snorts] and thank
[40:44] God enough.
[40:47] Now, Jesus died on the cross. I'm not
[40:51] going to stop. went to the audience last
[40:53] night, but I'm not going to do that
[40:54] tonight. But uh people uh have started
[40:59] and on their journey and when they start
[41:02] on the journey, a lot of times they
[41:04] don't they don't continue.
[41:07] They stop somewhere. Let's go to the
[41:09] book of Jude
[41:13] 5.
[41:15] And he says,
[41:21] "I will therefore put you in
[41:22] remembrance,
[41:24] though you once knew this, how that the
[41:28] Lord having what?
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Save the people."
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Saved the people out of the land of
[41:33] Egypt, after he what?
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Destroyed them that what? Believe not.
[41:41] See, you got to keep on believing.
[41:46] You can't stop believing.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; See, they never made it where what they
[41:52] never received the full promise of God.
[41:57] They started the journey but they did
[41:59] not complete the journey because they
[42:02] start doubting.
[42:05] Maybe I will do it.
[42:07] I have to walk away and then I have to
[42:10] get somebody to read for me if I walk
[42:11] away. Well, by the grace of God, often
[42:15] times
[42:17] people start on the journey and they
[42:19] start with faith, but
[42:23] after a period of time, they stop
[42:25] believing.
[42:26] Are you with me? The prophet of God
[42:29] said, "People come on the uh pull pit
[42:31] and they get prayer and they were blind
[42:33] and the eyes come open and by the time
[42:36] they get to the seat,
[42:39] they blind again." And my question was,
[42:43] what happens? What causes that blind
[42:46] person, Amen, to see on the pullpit and
[42:50] by the time they get in their seat,
[42:53] they blind again,
[42:56] but their eyes were open. What happened
[42:59] between
[43:00] on the coming through the prayer line
[43:03] getting prayer and the eyes they
[43:05] received their sight they were blind and
[43:08] they get to the seat and they bl and
[43:10] they can and the I mean they were the
[43:12] eyes were open and they get to the seat
[43:14] and they blind again. What happened?
[43:21] What causes that?
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Anybody?
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[43:28] They doubted
[43:31] because what happens to folks that raise
[43:35] their hand? God, you [laughter] know,
[43:38] the Lord save them.
[43:40] You know, we the devil can't take your
[43:43] salvation from you, can he?
[43:46] &gt;&gt; But you sure can give it to him.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; You said, you say, "The joy that I had,
[43:51] the world didn't give it, and the world
[43:53] can't take it from me."
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're saved, you must believe
[43:59] that, Amen. God didn't come just only to
[44:04] save, but take you into the fullness of
[44:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the
[44:10] Holy Ghost is joy, unspeakable, and full
[44:13] of glory.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; And you see, BUT IF YOU DON'T GET
[44:17] [screaming] THERE, AMEN. IT'S NOT GOD
[44:20] FAULT. IT'S YOUR FAITH. When your faith
[44:22] stopped, Amen. Your Amen. Your blessings
[44:27] won't flow like they ought to flow.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; See, sometime it's not that the promised
[44:33] land is not there. The promised land was
[44:36] there, but they begin to doubt.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Everything God promised you and I. And
[44:42] everything THAT JESUS DIED for is yours.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's already been bought and
[44:50] purchased and paid for. Amen. The
[44:52] abstract TITLE DEED HAS BEEN IT CAME
[44:55] BACK.
[44:57] AMEN.
[44:59] OH, HALLELUJAH. AND GOD HAS given you.
[45:03] AMEN. THAT SAME BLESSINGS.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; THAT ADAM HAD [screaming] IN the
[45:07] beginning.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's saying that you are THE
[45:11] REDEEMED OF THE LORD.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; To redeem TO BE BROUGHT BACK.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO GOD WANT TO BRING YOU BACK in
[45:21] the original condition.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; And you see the last thing we're waiting
[45:26] on the redemption of our bodies, BUT
[45:29] IT'S ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT. WE'RE SET
[45:31] TOGETHER now in heavenly places IN
[45:34] CHRIST JESUS.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; WE ALREADY HAVE arrived in heavenly
[45:38] places.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE
[45:41] THERE?
[45:43] &gt;&gt; YOUR FAITH MUST AMEN. HAVE YOU RESTED IN
[45:48] KNOWING OF ASSURITY THAT I'M IN HEAVENLY
[45:50] PLACES?
[45:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU DOUBT THAT, YOU'LL NEVER BE
[45:54] THERE.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; But it's something about a believer. A
[45:58] believer. Amen. Experience
[46:02] the things that God promised.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; See, faith cannot be defeated.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; And when you have And when you have
[46:15] faith in God, you don't have to waver.

[46:23] Amen. If you know your house been paid
[46:26] off or your car been paid off and you
[46:29] have the title deed to it. Amen. Praise
[46:32] God. And then they they say, "Well, you
[46:35] owe $10,000 [screaming]
[46:37] on this house." You said, "I done paid
[46:39] THIS THING OFF. I got the deed. Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; They said, "WELL, YOU OWE $1,000 on this
[46:44] car." You said, "I got the deed to prove
[46:48] that I Amen. It's been paid off."
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; So, you know that JESUS HAS PAID THE
[46:58] PRICE WITH HIS OWN BLOOD AND YOU KNOW HE
[47:01] SHED IT AND YOU KNOW, AMEN. PRAISE GOD
[47:05] IS NO charges against you.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THE DEVIL COME AGAINST YOU,

[47:13] RIGHTS.

[47:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A RIGHT TO TELL THE DEVIL,
[47:19] [screaming] "GET OFF MY PROPERTY."
[47:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; GET OFF OF HERE.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] DON'T BELONG HERE.

[47:30] me, Satan."
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you got that. But if you Well,
[47:36] see, we act like we little babies.
[47:41] [clears throat]
[47:41] Well, Lord, you know,
[47:45] pastor, please pray for me. I feel so
[47:49] bad
[47:51] and I don't know whether or not I can
[47:56] make it no father.
[47:59] You know, it's hard.
[48:02] I'm having struggles.
[48:04] I'm having battles and I can't hardly
[48:07] make it. Oh, [laughter]
[48:10] I believe I can't help it. My [snorts]

[48:47] your head down because you're not
[48:49] legally it's not legally yours because
[48:53] your faith has not been anchored. Your
[48:57] approach to God has been wrong.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You approach with God by unbelief.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you actually don't really
[49:08] believe that Jesus did what he said he
[49:11] did.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; But if you believe that he died for your
[49:14] sins and that Amen. all you got TO DO IS

[50:06] right here where Ma
[50:08] Josiah sitting
[50:11] and you needed something from Jesus
[50:14] and you needed to be healed
[50:18] and you asked Jesus to heal you, what

[50:39] &gt;&gt; So you asked Jesus to do something and
[50:42] he said, "I can't do it." Why?
[50:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS FINISHED 2,000 YEARS AGO.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; THE SAME WAY WITH YOUR SINS. YOUR SINS
[50:51] WEREN'T FORGIVEN 2,000 years ago. Why

[51:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE WE DOUBT
[51:06] WHETHER OR NOT GOD HAS DONE EXACTLY WHAT

[51:10] &gt;&gt; SO YOU DON'T DOUBT GOD. [screaming] GOD
[51:12] SAID WITH THIS STRIPES I'M HEALED.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; SO I GOT TO HAMMER it down.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:18] I was telling the sanction Mullins, boy,
[51:21] since I've been on this faith.
[51:23] I I I stayed up about all night one
[51:27] night talking about in some pain sweat
[51:30] popping. I said, "Oh, Lord, you know, I
[51:33] need something for pain. Woo! I need
[51:36] something. I need something for this and
[51:38] that. I ain't got no pain medicine in
[51:41] the house." I said, "Well, Lord Jesus,
[51:45] some I said, I got to believe. I'm
[51:47] preaching this faith. I got to have it."
[51:49] Oh, don't the devil test you.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; He'll test you. He'll try you. Amen. I
[51:56] had to keep on saying, "I'm healed. I'm
[51:59] healed." I said, "Praise the Lord. I'm
[52:02] healed."
[52:03] [laughter]
[52:04] &gt;&gt; And the pain got worse
[52:07] and sleepless nights come. I'm down on
[52:11] my knees crying out. Lord, I'm praying
[52:13] for everybody. I forgot about praying
[52:15] for myself because I, you know, uh, with
[52:19] all this pain, ain't no use in trying to
[52:20] sleep. Too much pain. So, I'm praying
[52:23] for everybody. So, I just said, "Thank
[52:26] the Lord." And I'm healed. I have to
[52:29] convince myself that I'm healed cuz this
[52:31] pain tell me I ain't healed.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; But, I HAVE TO CONVINCE MYSELF WHETHER
[52:36] OR NOT I BELIEVE THE WORD OR NOT. AMEN.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; SO SOMEHOW ME AND THE ME FAITH AND AND
[52:42] and me, we got TO GET ON ONE ACCORD.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I got TO GET ON ONE ACCORD. I
[52:48] EITHER I BELIEVE IT. I'MMA SIT
[52:50] [screaming] HERE. I'm going TRY TO RUN
[52:51] TO THE DOCTOR.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; I ain't running to no doctor now. God
[52:58] just told the doctor the other day.
[53:01] [laughter]
[53:03] I said, "If you try some medicine, I
[53:06] ain't taking it. [laughter]
[53:09] He said, "Oh, Lord." It was a new
[53:11] doctor. I said, "I ain't taking no
[53:13] medicine." He said, "Your blood pressure
[53:15] was
[53:17] 140 over 706,
[53:21] I mean 7 something." And she said, "You
[53:25] need some high blood pressure." I You
[53:28] better forget it. I ain't taking no high
[53:30] blood sugar. Oh, 70 something. I know I
[53:34] ain't taking nothing. I said, "I ain't
[53:36] going to take it anyway." She said, "Oh,
[53:38] oh, well, you need to walk. You need to
[53:42] go on a diet." [laughter]
[53:46] I said, "I know that all the time." And
[53:48] I tell her that, [laughter]
[53:50] you know what I'm saying? But by the
[53:53] grace of God, after they find out I
[53:55] ain't going to take the medicine, she
[53:57] start
[53:58] subscribing things that you can do.
[54:00] [laughter]
[54:01] It's all right. Amen. Y'all pray for me.

[1:03:49] Because they hadn't recognized.
[1:03:52] Neither have they recognized who they
[1:03:54] are.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God. What you really want? Some
[1:03:58] people don't want nothing.
[1:04:02] They don't want nothing from God. They
[1:04:04] come to church and they don't have any
[1:04:06] expectation.
[1:04:10] If you don't want nothing, come to
[1:04:12] church expecting God to do something for
[1:04:14] somebody else.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; If you don't think you have a need, come
[1:04:18] to church thinking about other folk have
[1:04:22] needs.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody, Lord, need something in here.
[1:04:27] And Lord, I'm praying. I'm sending up MY
[1:04:29] TEMPLE. I'M CRYING OUT, "GOD,
[1:04:31] [screaming] BLESS THEM.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; BLESS SOMEBODY TONIGHT. LORD, [laughter]
[1:04:35] SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE BLESSED. SOMEBODY
[1:04:37] NEEDS TO BE DELIVERED. SOMEBODY NEED TO
[1:04:39] BE SAVED. LORD, DO SOMETHING FOR
[1:04:42] SOMEBODY.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you. Amen. I forgot about
[1:04:45] praying for myself. Amen. I said, Amen.
[1:04:48] The pain is here, but I'm praying for
[1:04:50] everybody else. Thank you, Lord. I'm
[1:04:52] down here crying out on my knees. Amen.
[1:04:55] Praise God. It might take hours and
[1:04:58] hours, BUT I'M CRYING OUT, "LORD,
[1:04:59] [screaming]
[1:05:00] BLESS THIS ONE AND BLESS THAT ONE."
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And then I you know it comes to a
[1:05:07] point that you even asking the you know
[1:05:10] it's it's difficult to ask the Lord to
[1:05:12] bless your enemies
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; and it it's things that happen in life
[1:05:20] that you really it takes God to move and
[1:05:24] agape love to be done because if faith
[1:05:27] works by love if you want if you want to
[1:05:31] have real faith it has to be the divine
[1:05:35] love down in your heart.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And if that love is deep enough, you

[1:05:44] and compassion, he was touched by the
[1:05:47] feeling of our infirmities.
[1:05:49] Amen. So God because of his love, he
[1:05:53] could feel what you feel
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; because he loved love a an unlovable
[1:05:59] people, people that you know, people
[1:06:01] that didn't deserve to be loved because
[1:06:03] we were enemies in our mind by wicked
[1:06:05] works. But Christ died for the
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; ungodly.
[1:06:10] He He died when we Amen. We don't see we
[1:06:14] we think THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.
[1:06:16] Instead of having FAITH IN GOD, WE think
[1:06:18] it's something that we got to do,
[1:06:20] MEASURE UP TO THAT ALL ALL OF A SUDDEN
[1:06:23] IT'S GOING TO TAKE OFF WHEN I DO THIS or
[1:06:26] when I can uh believe this and do it.
[1:06:29] Uh-uh. JUST START THANKING GOD. AMEN.
[1:06:31] You said, "Well, I I don't what I'mma
[1:06:33] thank you for,
[1:06:35] oh Lord, you ain't done nothing."
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Who said that?
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Who thought that? Well, I can't take it
[1:06:44] cuz he ain't done nothing for me yet.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You know, I said it so much.
[1:06:49] If he ain't done nothing, he already
[1:06:51] done enough.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And then Brother Ernest took it for me.
[1:06:55] [clears throat]
[1:06:56] [laughter]
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; So, it seemed like his is his he got a
[1:07:00] patent on it. [laughter]
[1:07:04] I said he already done enough.

[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But if you know the
[1:07:57] money is in the bank, then you can go
[1:08:00] there and say, "I want $50,000."
[1:08:04] Because you know it's in the bank. in
[1:08:05] the right and you can draw it. Amen. And
[1:08:08] you know, amen, what God promised you.
[1:08:11] Amen. That God got it. Amen. HE CAN GIVE
[1:08:14] IT TO YOU.
