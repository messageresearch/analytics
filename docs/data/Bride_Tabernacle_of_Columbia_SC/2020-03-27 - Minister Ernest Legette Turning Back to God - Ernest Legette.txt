you for we love you now we appreciate you God for all things that you do in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen we want to look at the book of first Kings 18 by God's grace first Kings 18 God is good first Kings 18 and we'll begin here at here at the 25th verse and it reads and Elijah said unto the prophets of Bel choose you one Bull up for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire on it under and they took the boy out which was given and they dressed it and called on the name of bale from the morning to the evening saying old Bale hear us but there was no voice nor any of that answer and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at the noon that Elijah mocked them and said and said cry aloud for he is God either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or prayer of Vinci sleepi then he must be awake and they cried out and cut themselves after their manner with the knives and Lance's start upon them and it came to pass when the midday when it came to pass and when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded and enlarges it and said to all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down and Elijah took 12 stones according to the number of trials of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood on in order and cut the bull off in peace and laid him on the wood and he said fill the barrels with water and pour on it the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time they did the second time he said do it the third time and he did it a third time and the water ran about the altar and he filled a trench also with water and he came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elisha the prophet came near and say Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at thy word hear me o Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is God the Lord he is God may God had blessed you the reading of his word tonight by God's grace we just want to talk to you for a moment on turning back to God amen turning back to God we know that the setting here in the scriptures you know that it was in the time of a famine and the famine was brought about because of a drought you know and in the drought what what brought it all the drought and famine about was the sins of the people God allowed it had Elijah going to speak the king the king at the time he have and he says they won't be due nor rain until I called for it why because of the people had left God and the people had went out to Bill and in and served serve bill and his idols so God allowed it you know for a space of time but it came a time where God wasn't gonna put up with it no more it came a time where God was gonna call the people back to him I like how in the scriptures that we read it says that Elijah repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down I like that because I said you know God sometimes he does stuff in our lives and he gets us back down on our knees again he causes us to come back to the altar a lot of times we've taken the all too away from our homes we've taken it away from the churches what have we done we've broken down the altar of God but I'm saying tonight well we should rebuild the altar as Elijah he built the altar and he rebuilt the altar because he knew that God was doing something but tonight we're talking about turning back to God we know that like I said that there was a time that God wasn't gonna put up with sin no more it was a time that God wasn't gonna put up with the things they were doing so what he did he sent the famine to get the people attention he allow a lot of times in the scriptures things that happen to draw the attention of the people get the people hearts and minds to turn back to him and that's what God does in our lives he allows certain things that happened because as God has blessed us so richly many of times we continue going on and we forgot all about God when God picks us up from the place that we are sometimes and we get back on our feet we forget about who the one was that picked us up so God in his entirety sometimes he allows storms to come he allow trials and tribulations to hit to do what he gets your mind to turn back to him come back to him and he can be your guard again come on he'll let your jaw shut down he'll let your health fail you he'll let your friends your mother and your father forsake you and then even in that sometimes people still won't come to God I said tonight what will it take for the people hearts to turn back what would it take for the people to get sin out of their lives and wanna have a desire to serve the Lord again what would it take tonight will it take guard shutting up to heaven so it won't rain would it take the coronavirus the way is hitting the world today would it take more than that for God to get the people attention to show that they left God how many believe that tonight but we find that here in a Centon I said God had to send a famine he was trying to get attention of the people in that day we know the people's hearts they had turned from God come on and know a lot of times people can go to church and they still do go to church they like go to church and they might sing on the choir they might preach they might pay the tires and pay the officers but yet when God look at him he say your heart ain't in it your heart is still turned from me it's more brothers and sisters than what we do without what appears but where's your heart come on that's what God is judging God wants your heart in the worship God wants your heart and the things that you do for him I believe that Jesus rebuked the first season of that day in a surger season he says that you honor me with you with your mouth even Isaiah prophesied it he's said in your lips but your heart is far from me come on he said you going to church you doing the things where the outward appearance buddy buddy the inside you full of dead man bones and all corruption God don't just want to a worshipping truth but God wants worship in spirit and in truth God wants somebody that's gonna cry out to them with all their heart God want somebody let's go say Lord not only do I need you in the bad times but God I need you in the good times not only do I need you in the morning but God I need you in the evening Lord not only do I need you when I'm sick but God I need you when I'm will God I need you every day of my life that's the kind of people that God wants that's the kind of people that God is calling back to the sanctuary how many believe that but we find that I says you know that's what happened in that day they were going you know they had tore down all the altars of God and they set up the altars of bail no doubt still going to the regular rituals and things but God hadn't forgotten about the people God had to send a famine in that day God had to do something to get the people's or hearts to turn back and that's the thing about it you know we want to take all this time and this opportunity that God has given us to get on our knees and begin to cry out to God and say Lord God whatever I got to give you out of my life I want to ask you today whatever you hold it onto is it worth it will it be worth it when tomorrow you don't know where you're gonna be at you don't know the day when your number gonna be calm and yet you hold it on things that's gonna perish that's gonna fade away one day but I want to say that when you get Jesus down on the inside it doesn't matter what the world does or what happens to this body it's something eternal down on the inside it's enough to get you out of the grave one day I believe that with all of my heart but we find that what's what happens today people they want to bear God's name but they don't buy even though they bought a bear God's name because they know that it's power in their name they know that the name of the Lord is a strong tower so a lot of times you know you find people no matter where they are or what kind of condition they're in when they find themselves in trouble the first name they call might not be mama might not be daddy but they call oh Jesus why because they know that there's power in that name but I fear that one day you'll call on that name Jesus any leaders would be to go you will call on that name Jesus and his arm will be too short to reach but right now what God is still available call on that name like you mean it call on that name like you want them to do something for you Oh glory to God I believe that what all about heart that it's time now if we ever was serious about our Christian journey now it's the time to get serious about our Christian journey if we ever was serious about our walking witness since with Christ knows the time God knows there was a time we don't know let's say what tomorrow will bring but we know who holds tomorrow we know that God's got it all in control no matter what's going on God's got it all in control how many believe that tonight but we find that I says what it is you know I was thinking about how in the scriptures in the book of ezekiel the sixteenth chapter and how guardar talked about he was prophesied of how he found israel he says you know what I found you he says you were you were covered in blood he said that your neighbor wasn't even cut he said everybody that walked by you they ain't he looked at your wagon his nobody picked you up but they left you in that miserable condition to die come on and we know that even today a lot of times if the devil would have his way then we would have died in sin we would have died in the condition we had but I thank God tonight for His grace and His mercy he said when I walk by you I saw you I picked you up come on how many that guard um picked up tonight how many God I picked you up and he said I watched you all for you blood cut your navel off you come on come on somebody God picked you up God cleaned you up God he took what the world looked at you and said you'll never be nothing and God made something out of you and he said but when I took you up and I watched you come on I put pearls on your clothes you and of calls you out to my name hallelujah God done those things he said but yet when you got strong come on when you got on your feet when you've got to the condition where you can move around on your home come on he said then you forgot all about me come on I said don't forget about God tonight don't forget about the one who picked you up from a life of sin don't forget about the one who do brought you from sin and shame who heals you don't forget about the one when you get on your feet but stay with God amen glory to God we're talking about turning back God I know he has to remind us of those things a lot of times we find that you know like he says in that day how you know Elijah and how he went and he said it won't be rain come on it won't be due until I call for it he was all because God was trying to draw the people back to him God wanted to do something to turn the people heart back not just to be called by his name wasn't good enough but he was doing it because he wanted their hearts to turn back so we know that even in that time the rain didn't falling you know what happened to drought King but even in the drought I believe that God still had manna for his people even in the drought God still blessed his people with a look you reading this crypsis you see how Obadiah because in first king 17 and how he hid he worked in the king's storehouse and how he hid some of the profits in those and how many they hadn't fouled a neat avail in God still blessed him we think about the shoot of my woman and how she took care of large and how the crews of all and in the mill never ran dry until the day that rain fell back on the earth see that's one thing about it that's why you is good that's a good thing to be saved it's a good thing to live for the Lord because even in the midst of a crisis God is going to take care of his people when the grocery store run out God is gonna make sure you still got plenty when everything is against you in the world God is gonna take care of his people why because you his children and I believe David said I never seen the righteous forsaken nor see begging for bread we got to beg for bread tonight we know God is gonna take care of us how many believe that but we find that I says you know in that day you know it Elisha we're talking about turning back to God come on it didn't rain and famine came and we know that the people they went through something you know to go that made that long of a time without rain and drought maybe going through that time and seeing oh that all of their resources was about to run out and it wasn't nothing they can do about it the only thing they can do is wait for the rain to come they couldn't bring about the rain but Elijah said it won't be no rain so I call for it come on it was something supernatural in that day that was taking place and we find out today I heard somebody say that the virus I'll be going by the summer time I heard him say it'll be gone by this time but come on when yet they don't even know what it is how can we put a time limit and know when it's gonna be going it's gonna take supernatural intervention tonight what its gonna take it's gonna take God being merciful to the world God moving his hands and saying that's enough that's what it's gonna take the doctors don't know what to do but I want to say doctor Jesus he knows exactly what to do when they turning you away telling you don't even come to the hospital where you gonna go - then I say divine healing God is still healing tonight how many believe that glory to gosh but we find that you know I think about that and how you know the world is in a panic mode and they don't know what to do we thank God for their efforts we thank God for the nurses we thank the heart for the doctors but when they don't know what to do we know that Jesus he knows what to do you know if it ever was a time you know a lot of times we profess from our mouth that God is our help salute but right now you gonna find out where the guard is your absolute or not whether God is you're holding all or not why because in this time sometimes God will push you to the limit he'll test you come on he'll try he'll get you to that breaking point but he won't let you break I'm so glad tonight but even in the breaking point God won't let you break oh you've got to do is keep holding on you're God's unchanging hands keep holding on to the word that dog is giving you in guarding unless you fall to the ground I believe that how many believe that tonight Oh God is being so good to us we look at how I said even in that you know he said it won't be rain do talk calling for it come on you know and then we know that it when it came to time we God was going to end the drought first thing Elijah did he win it called for he helped and told people I want to have a showdown come on open mark Carmel he called the people thing you know how yeah I'll eat him and what he done first thing he when he saw Elijah he said to Elijah and this you can go back and you read and he said I doubt the one that trouble if Israel come on and a lot of times the largest Saint the one that troubling is are you to run you the reason why God brought this drought the people wouldn't be in seeing if you wouldn't allowed or put bells or idols and things up and a lot of times we want to find excuses for the condition of the way we are the condition of our lives and in the way our lives are instead of taking our self responsibility and saying Lord it's not that person it's not me sometimes we want to brain the preachers sometimes we want to blame the people in the church sometime we want to blame our brother or sister instead of standing up taking or it's not making excuses for our sins and saying Lord it's me God what can I do Lord to get back right with You Lord God I don't want to believe and oh nobody else is right flying high as I post to event connecting it up with true God I don't want to blame it on nobody God what do I have to do Lord that were you to send the rain back in my life how many want that ring sitting back in their lives but we find that you know how he say you're the one but he says come all you says but let's go down and I want to prove to you he wanted to prove true that the God that they was worship because they were worshiping was wasn't the like the God Jehovah wasn't the Almighty God about in fact was just idols that they will worship he wanted to show them that even in those times and that's what it is God a lot of times he exposes things God exposes things in our house because we're gonna put in our trust in the wrong places we've been putting how trusting man we've been putting our trusting money well I want to ask you a question what good is money gonna do right now what good is a man gonna do right now what good the church gonna do right now we've been putting our trust in the wrong places but he said I want you to quit put your trust and all these material things all these carnal things put your trust back in me I'm the one that can save you I'm the one that'll heal you I'm the one that'll bail you out God wants us to put our trust back in him I believe the Bible says if you trust in the Lord with all thine heart come on not some of your heart he said trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding but in all your ways acknowledge him in God is gonna direct you God is gonna legion God's come on get back to trusting God get back to him with all of your heart and let God lead you God is so good but we find that I says in that day we know what happened I like how I was saying how large or how he repaired the altar come on he repaired the altar I don't know about you but in these last couple of weeks I've been repairing the altar been repairing the altar at home been repairing the altar everywhere I go it's my car or whatever every time you find time to always for praying time it's the time to call on that name Jesus if you ever need it know how it's the time right now to learn how because why one day the door is gonna be shut one day it's gonna be too late God is gonna quit coal and dealing with the Gentiles turn back to the Jews then what you'll be then let as holy or be holy still those that are filthy will be filthy still don't let God find you in your filthy ways don't let God find you in that way but when God finds you let you be holy why because it's the Holy Ghost living inside of you that's holy and it's making you holy I believe that you know we look at how I like how he says he rebuilt the altar then he began to he began to let them go oh you do your thing he rebuilt the altar but he says Lord he says God and he began to pray to him he says I want you to let the people know come on I want you to do something let the people know that this day I turn their hearts back come on I pray tonight that God is doing something come on and I pray tonight that you hear it in the spirit that God is calling you turn back God is saying come on with this was going on turn back come back to me saith the Lord that's what he's saying I pray tonight that even as larger prayed he said Lord let the people know you you turn their heart back I pray that if God give us grace come on if God give us a great set we can come and gather again and meet again freely you ought to praise God like you ain't never praised him before you ought to say I was glad when they said unto me let us come into the house of the Lord why because one day we didn't know that just what happened right now is gonna take it away but God just showing you that anything can happen tomorrow come on things are happening so quick and where you gonna be where will your life be if God was to call your number right now so many people thinking they got time so did the rich man that built the barns but he didn't know that tomorrow he will he woke up he was gonna lift up his eyes in hell why because he thought he had time I want to say we know that you know even Jesus prophesied and begin to say if Jesus begin to say as it was in the days of Noah come on so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed he says in that day they was eating drinking marries all doing all these things go going on in a natural ways even though destruction was on the way even though the art was being built God was getting ready to destroy the world but that didn't make them turn around that didn't make them stop from the sin and that they were doing they were still drinking they were still lying and cheating in the imagination man Oh heart every page continually why because they couldn't see that God was bringing judgment on the land and we look at now what's going on today I say it's God bringing judgment on the land most of people it'll go right by them and they won't know it it's a word that we use called reprobate when they know us right but yet they still won't do it come on I pray tonight by God's grace that he don't it he would give us mercy just stop and think about it for a while stop and consider our ways and say Lord God what am i doing where am I at dog show me myself guard I need your help how many need God's help tonight but we find that yo I says that it's something about it no man you know know the day nor the hour and that's true but but he did tell us what the season would be like he said as it was in the days of Noah come on as it was in the days of lot he started bringing all these things said you'll see wars and rumors of wars he started letting us know what the season was gonna be like he said when you see these things he says you better look up when you see the fig tree bud and come on you better look up why because your redemption is drawing nigh now's the time you ever want to be serious with God now it's the time to get serious with God give God your Hall at our sister Irene used to sing a song give God all you got and that song still rings in my heart today give God all you got I want to give God all I got it might not be much but give it to God God could do something with it I believe God can do with your life right now where you sitting at you may be sitting at home I don't know you what you may be doing even right now but give God all your God give your life to Jesus whatever you holding your back come on let it go it ain't worth for right now huh this little time that we have here left on earth even if we were to live our full lives out ain't nothing compared to eternity and I believe that he said no man knoweth the day nor the hour come on but he did let us know or what the season you know would be like and we find that I said God is trying to turn our hearts back you know what happened when I like how when Elijah built the altar come on then he began to praying I like how the Bible says that the fire of the Lord fell come on and it consumed everything it consumed the altar consumed this sacrifice it licked up a hold of water I like how it says the window the fire God fell and I pray I said Lord what do we need today Lord we need your fire to fall we could talk about how it was in the days of ho but we need to fire right now just to talk about what happened in the past ain't gonna do us no good right now God we need your fire to fall we need God's fire to fall to consumers I said consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit burn out everything Lord that ain't like you got lit up Oh God all of my sins and transgressions my wicked ways God clean me up somebody out the crowd for the Lord to send the fire back God will send a fire how many believe that I know these I know he will you know it's something about it I says that when their hearts will turn back come on one of the first thing they did when God turned off people heart back he said it gather up the prophets bill don't let him live we're gonna kill him come on he said go go take the idols we're gonna destroy come on God didn't just turn their hearts back and they still just went on with those things temptations and things before them come on but Wingard when their heart stirs turn back first thing they had to do those things that had that had them bound those things they had them call snares they had to deal with him and that's what happens and a lot of times in our lives God would do something special come on God I'll come and deliver you God to heal you save you come on but a lot of times when we get out of those condition we don't deal with the same problem come on let me say this it's not the world doesn't have a political crisis but the world has a sin a sin problem of sin crisis we don't want to deal with them but I want to say tonight let's deal with them come on let's deal with you as an individual let's deal with your life for your condition let's deal with what's holding you back from receiving the Holy Ghost come on he said to repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are missing your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and the promise is unto you and your children it's Adam that afar off come on I said what's holding you back because God is not alive when when you have been baptized buried in his name and rise up God is duty-bound to fill you with the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost and what's the problem what's holding you back come on look at your life look at your condition look at everything around you're saying god what is if there's anything Lord holding me back god I want to separate it God because I need you now this thing that's real God I need your blood to cover me god I don't need you just to walk with me but God I need you to be in me and I need to carry you everywhere I go I can't see the forest scene any means I can't see the foreseen dangers God I need your help crowd Lord who are the Lord is still able to be found but we believe that I says you know it's something about it how I said God he loves the cries of his people God he does things and even the scriptures it says that and when my people that are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray come on seek my face and turn from their wicked ways come on you know it's something about the cry you know the earth today just has the world in the days of Noah just has the world in the days of lot cry went out the people's lives and the condition of their lives produced the cry and that cry went to heaven and God heard the cry was so wicked in the day is a lot that God came to himself and he says I got to go see is to cry all together or what we hear it come on I believe today that a cries went up you know each and every one of I into individual lives are producing to cry when when the cry goes up what what is God hearing out of your life come on you might be saying one thing for your mouth or walking in some one thing from out what appearance but when it gets up to heaven what is God hearing come on I pray tonight by the grace of God that the cry that's going up when God hear he hear the cry of a bleating lamb he heard a cry of somebody crying out for mercy come on you remember in the scriptures he said to mark knows that side cry for the abominations that's done in a scene come on if we ever needed a side cry now it's the time to sign cry let us bow heavily father Lord we thank you O God turn us back Lord I believe it right now you don't have to be here tonight but wherever you are I believe God is calling you back he said let every man examine himself are you examining
