[35:16] jeremiah 6 and 14
[35:21] it says they have healed
[35:26] also the hurt of the daughter
[35:31] of my people slightly
[35:34] saying peace peace and
[35:38] when there is no peace
[35:44] were they ashamed when they had
[35:48] committed abomination nay
[35:53] they were not at all ashamed
[35:57] neither could they blush
[36:01] therefore they shall fall among them
[36:05] that fall at the time that i
[36:09] visit them they should be cast
[36:12] down said the lord
[36:15] thus said the lord stand ye in the way
[36:20] and see and ask for
[36:24] the old path where
[36:27] [Music]
[36:28] is the good way
[36:32] and walk there in
[36:35] and ye shall find rest
[36:38] for your soul but they say
[36:42] we will not walk therein
[36:46] also i set
[36:49] watchmen over you saying hearken
[36:54] to the sound of the trumpet but they say
[36:59] we will not hearken
[37:02] therefore here you nations
[37:06] and no old congregation
[37:10] what is among them here
[37:13] or earth behold
[37:16] i will bring evil among this people
[37:22] even the fruit of their thoughts
[37:25] because they have not hearkened unto my
[37:28] words
[37:30] not my law but rejected it
[37:36] to what purpose coming there
[37:39] to me incense from shebo
[37:44] and sweet cane from the country
[37:47] for of our country your burnt offerings
[37:52] are not acceptable nor your sacrifice
[37:57] sweet
[37:57] unto me
[38:00] therefore thus said the lord
[38:04] behold i will lay a stumbling block
[38:06] before this people
[38:09] and the fathers and the son together
[38:12] shall fall upon them
[38:15] their neighbors and his friends should
[38:18] perish
[38:20] thus said the lord behold a people
[38:23] come from the north country and a great
[38:26] nation shall be rise from
[38:30] the side of the earth they shall lay
[38:34] hole
[38:35] on the bow and spear
[38:39] and they are cured
[38:43] cruel they are cruel
[38:46] have no mercy their voice rolled
[38:51] like the sea and
[38:54] they ride upon horses set
[38:58] in a ray as men for war
[39:01] against the old daughters of
[39:04] zion we have heard
[39:08] the frame they are
[39:11] our hands of wax feeble anguish
[39:15] has taken hold of us and pain
[39:18] as a woman in travail

[39:31] enemy and the fear is on
[39:35] every side god bless to read this word

[40:15] praise god somebody says take me back
[40:19] dear lord

[40:27] the message of the hour is to turn the
[40:29] faith
[40:32] of the children back to that which the
[40:36] apostolic fathers
[40:38] had so we're to go back to the original
[40:43] word
[40:46] the original seed
[40:50] go back into
[40:54] what they preach
[40:58] what the apostles and the prophets
[41:00] preached
[41:02] so if we have been turned back by
[41:06] the grace of god and our hearts have
[41:07] been turned back
[41:10] then the old time religion the effect
[41:14] that
[41:15] what they had when they received the
[41:17] holy ghost
[41:20] the effect that they had in the world
[41:23] in effect that the holy ghost
[41:27] in them and what the holy ghost did for
[41:29] them
[41:30] and did through them and in them
[41:34] that's what i said give me that old-time
[41:36] religion
[41:40] if you don't have it like that brother
[41:44] if you don't have the same spirit that
[41:46] they had
[41:51] i said the holy ghost that keeps you
[41:57] let's go back to the old path
[42:00] amen let's go back to the old way
[42:04] praise god well amen people that had it
[42:09] lived
[42:09] something
[42:15] now we got so many cry babies
[42:19] are you with me so many people talking
[42:23] about
[42:25] you know they can't live it no more
[42:32] so many people are failing to
[42:35] amen to be overcomers in this age
[42:41] i said give me that old-time religion
[42:45] praise god people can't take the word no
[42:48] more
[42:50] they don't want the word they want to do
[42:52] what they want
[42:53] and claim they believe the word they're
[42:56] just lying to themselves
[42:58] because people don't want
[43:01] see he said you've you're not talking to
[43:04] my prophets you're not talking
[43:06] to the preachers you're not listening to
[43:10] them you're doing what you want to do
[43:14] jeremiah was faced with the people doing
[43:16] what they want to do they said we will
[43:19] not
[43:20] and they rejected what jeremiah was
[43:22] telling them
[43:26] yet they was uh they wanted to bring
[43:28] these sweet-smelling
[43:30] uh incense before god and off of god all
[43:34] these sweet incenses
[43:36] from shebo i i mean
[43:39] and god said i don't want it
[43:42] he said i'm not going to accept your
[43:44] your sacrifices and
[43:46] and your sweet uh smelling incense i
[43:49] don't want it
[43:52] you know sometimes we think well lord i
[43:55] i'm not going to listen to
[43:57] amen the prophets and i'm not going to
[43:59] listen to the preacher
[44:00] and i'm not going to listen to your word
[44:02] but i'm going to give you this
[44:06] instead i'm going to give you sacrifices
[44:09] i'm going to give you an
[44:10] offering i'm going to give you this god
[44:12] said i don't want it
[44:15] i reject it y'all see what
[44:18] he was saying is it plain enough or is
[44:21] this something that i'm making up
[44:23] he said the watchman he said i set
[44:26] watchman over you
[44:28] saying hawking to the sound of the
[44:30] trumpet
[44:31] are you with me but they say
[44:35] we were not
[44:38] are you with me we were not
[44:42] hawking are you up man
[44:46] so we'll we'll we'll we'll land
[44:49] we're in a world where god said honking
[44:51] to the sign of the trumpet
[44:53] amen the people of not hark and god sent
[44:56] his servant in this hour
[44:58] and he spoke to the nation and spoke to
[45:00] the world and said hawking to the
[45:04] the word
[45:10] confirming the word with signs and
[45:13] wonders and miracles
[45:15] but that yet the world said we were not
[45:17] hawking
[45:20] america hasn't rejected the word
[45:25] but yet they said we offer you lord all
[45:27] the praises and all the glory
[45:30] but when it comes down to the word they
[45:32] rejected the very word
[45:36] are you with me many times
[45:40] even pastors in this age have a very
[45:43] difficult time because
[45:44] people would tell them no matter what
[45:47] the word said we were not hawking
[45:51] are you with me we have a rebellious
[45:55] group of people that are going to church
[45:58] and they want to serve god but they want
[46:00] to do what they want
[46:03] and jeremiah must have had a tough time
[46:06] you know the preachers did not
[46:10] agree with jeremiah because most of the
[46:13] preachers had
[46:15] uh they were taking a a a a little bit
[46:17] of money
[46:18] under the table and they were so worried
[46:22] about
[46:22] and so they they rejected jeremiah
[46:27] but jeremiah had thus said the lord
[46:31] he knew he knew where he was standing
[46:34] and he knew what god had said
[46:37] so here jeremiah says
[46:42] he says they have
[46:45] in the 14th verse they have also
[46:51] they have they have healed
[46:54] also the hurt of the daughters of my
[46:57] people what
[46:59] slightly amen
[47:02] yes it's a little healing but it's a
[47:04] slightly
[47:07] and you know people are satisfied with
[47:09] uh
[47:10] slightly being healed but not really
[47:13] being
[47:14] fully delivered a total deliverance
[47:18] they don't mind being delivered slightly
[47:20] or heal
[47:21] a little but they don't want total
[47:23] healing
[47:26] they don't mind having a little bit of
[47:28] victory but they don't want to be
[47:30] victoriously they don't want to really
[47:34] over the enemy they don't want the
[47:36] devil out
[47:36] fully and completely i don't want the
[47:40] devil in my life at all
[47:43] not at all are you with me
[47:47] the bible said don't give place to the
[47:49] devil
[47:51] amen shine the very appearance don't
[47:54] even let it look like the devil
[47:57] don't even let it appear that you're
[47:59] walking in
[48:00] oh hallelujah i believe we
[48:07] we try to get back and we satisfy
[48:10] ourselves
[48:11] instead of the conviction that a
[48:13] christian ought to have in their heart
[48:16] a sister a brother ought to walk with
[48:18] conviction
[48:20] amen walk with something that dawn in
[48:22] the inside
[48:23] god i'm convicted hallelujah
[48:26] oh walk with the fear of god in the
[48:29] heart
[48:30] praise god that god has done something
[48:33] down ain't been
[48:34] deep enough in the inside god i feel you
[48:38] god i love you and i respect you i
[48:41] respect you enough god that i just don't
[48:44] want
[48:45] amen i just don't want to just plot
[48:48] just walk you know how some folk just
[48:52] walk so close to the edge and
[48:54] all you got to do is just push them a
[48:55] little bit now
[48:57] they're all the way out i'ma tell you
[49:00] don't put your tent towards sodom
[49:03] for you end up in sodom a lot of times
[49:07] we
[49:07] we pitched our tent because the grass
[49:09] looked greener on the other side
[49:12] are you up man some folk amen
[49:16] and you know how many times i i i preach
[49:19] don't let the green grass fool you
[49:22] amen don't let the devil blind you with
[49:24] everything looking wonderful and lovely
[49:27] and you know you're out of the world of
[49:28] god and out of the will of god
[49:31] but yet the green grass fool you
[49:34] brother and sister amen it's better to
[49:37] be in the word amen
[49:40] praise god you know it was something
[49:43] about the children of israel
[49:44] they met when they had uh the ark of the
[49:47] covenant
[49:48] amen david wanted they wanted to bring
[49:51] it back
[49:54] and um so they found a way to bring the
[49:56] ark
[49:58] back and they put it on an ox car
[50:01] amen and sometimes i believe instead of
[50:04] the old time religion i believe
[50:06] we got the ox cut religion
[50:10] are you with me praise god you know they
[50:13] used to
[50:13] had to carry it on their backs and on
[50:15] the shoulders
[50:17] amen praise god maybe they said you know
[50:20] this thing is getting a little
[50:22] anger look you know little waiting a
[50:25] little testy
[50:26] they're carrying on my shoulder but if
[50:28] the art is carrying it i won't have no
[50:30] you know feeling in other words
[50:34] sometimes we try new stuff
[50:37] praise god and a lot of time we want to
[50:41] do something new are you with me
[50:45] and think that this new approach to the
[50:47] gospel
[50:49] this new approach to the word amen
[50:52] nobody tried it but
[50:54] amen god had an established way
[50:57] according to the word where the ark was
[50:59] supposed to be carried on the shoulder
[51:02] of the priest are you with me
[51:07] but they thought they can do god of
[51:09] service without it being his will
[51:10] isn't that right but god was against
[51:14] that isn't that right
[51:16] cause those men to die
[51:19] are you with me brother and sister
[51:22] i only think when you try to do
[51:24] something outside of the will of god and
[51:26] outside of the world
[51:27] you're spiritually going to die for it
[51:32] you may not die in the physical right
[51:34] then but there'll be a physical
[51:36] death and a spiritual death
[51:39] because you're out of the will of god
[51:44] so brother and sister they tried to
[51:46] carry on the oxycontin
[51:49] i mean no no oscar let the ox
[51:52] look like everything's going well as
[51:53] well the ark is coming back and they all
[51:56] shot in the auctions
[51:57] returning but what happened
[52:00] it began to shake a little bit and they
[52:02] put their hands to it
[52:04] and die because god had an established
[52:08] way
[52:10] are you with me and i'm saying
[52:15] you know you know in prayer today
[52:18] it's something about bad new burden
[52:23] it's something like god wants you to the
[52:25] bad burden
[52:28] and the bible say bad you want another
[52:30] burdens amen
[52:33] we don't want to carry nothing amen
[52:37] i i i think it was difficult and it was
[52:40] a shame for mary
[52:42] to be impregnated and carrying a child
[52:44] and didn't even know a man
[52:47] but that was a thing that she had to
[52:48] shuffle
[52:50] are you with me she had to suffer the
[52:54] the the to be impregnated with the word
[52:57] amen you know when when people
[53:01] can be doing women can be doing all kind
[53:03] of thing but when they get pregnant
[53:05] sometimes if they were smoking or
[53:07] they were doing stuff drugs or anything
[53:09] sometimes they just quit
[53:12] because they don't want the baby to be
[53:14] affected
[53:16] and when you get impregnated with the
[53:18] holy ghost when
[53:19] you're carrying the word amen that means
[53:22] amen you cannot conduct yourself like
[53:25] one that does
[53:27] that don't have the holy ghost when you
[53:30] carrying amen jesus
[53:32] in you when you're travailing in
[53:35] to bring forth christ the word
[53:40] then you must understand amen that
[53:43] praise god
[53:44] i cannot do certain things that the rest
[53:46] of the world
[53:47] amen because i'm carrying the word in me
[53:52] praise god in the word amen praise god
[53:54] causing me
[53:55] to walk a certain way and you can't you
[53:58] know you
[53:59] you can't lift things like you used to
[54:01] live and you can't
[54:02] do things like you used to do and you
[54:04] can't drink things that you used to
[54:06] you can't oh hallelujah brother and
[54:10] sister because you got
[54:11] you're carrying the word they meant
[54:14] in the word amen that you are
[54:17] impregnated with the word with the
[54:19] with jesus on the inside and when
[54:23] jesus is on the inside jesus makes a
[54:26] difference in our lives

[54:31] because we got jesus on the inside
[54:34] so brother and sister how you conduct
[54:36] your life when you've got jesus on the

[1:03:39] little
[1:03:40] difficult in that time because everybody
[1:03:43] else was saying
[1:03:45] peace and safety and all of the well but
[1:03:48] jeremiah had a message that the
[1:03:50] of repentance and folks didn't want to
[1:03:52] repent
[1:03:53] they didn't think they needed to repent
[1:03:56] they meant
[1:03:57] praise god but god looked after the
[1:03:59] abominations in which they were doing
[1:04:02] and
[1:04:02] jeremiah had to cry loud he told him

[1:04:09] doing amen y'all wicked folk
[1:04:12] well they didn't want to hear them that
[1:04:15] they were a wicked
[1:04:16] and rebellious nation they didn't want
[1:04:18] to hear that
[1:04:20] no no we're good we're god's chosen hypo
[1:04:24] lord
[1:04:25] oh yes christian folk don't want to hear
[1:04:28] they meant god the judgment is hitting
[1:04:30] you
[1:04:31] and god's going to send judgment on you
[1:04:34] if you don't straighten your lives out
[1:04:36] god's going to send judgment

[1:05:10] spiritual
[1:05:12] brothers and sister where do we stand

[1:05:15] natural

[1:05:29] brother
[1:05:31] i didn't want to get down and down and
[1:05:34] personal
[1:05:35] i'm on that thing up there
[1:05:38] if i wasn't on that i probably would get
[1:05:40] a little
[1:05:43] but be on the internet
[1:05:46] and so i just can't get too far gone
[1:05:50] but by the grace of god
[1:05:54] i hope you get the message i hope you
[1:05:58] want that old-time religion
[1:06:00] i hope you want the old-time gospel
[1:06:04] they meant when you tell folk and they
[1:06:06] listen to you
[1:06:09] they'll save their soul amen
[1:06:12] they realize that you're telling them
[1:06:14] for their good
[1:06:15] telling them because you love them
[1:06:17] telling them amen because god shall
[1:06:19] repent
[1:06:21] are you with me i hope they understand
[1:06:25] this is the love of god
[1:06:26] through whom the lord loves you chasing
[1:06:30] trying to get you back to the old path
[1:06:33] the old-time religion
[1:06:35] where people got conviction in their
[1:06:37] heart
[1:06:38] i believe the reason why the children
[1:06:40] are not under conviction because the
[1:06:42] parents are not convicted
[1:06:45] praise god the parents won't they may
[1:06:47] repent no the children won't repent
