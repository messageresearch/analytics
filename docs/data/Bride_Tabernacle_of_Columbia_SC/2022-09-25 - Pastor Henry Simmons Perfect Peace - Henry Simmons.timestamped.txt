[34:41] we'll read the next verse Lion's verse
[34:43] together
[34:45] in that day shall
[34:49] in that day shall this song
[34:53] the song in the land of Judah

[35:12] thou will keep him in perfect peace
[35:17] whose mind is dead on thee because he
[35:22] trusted in thee for
[35:31] for he bringeth down them that dwell on
[35:36] high
[35:37] at the Lotus City he led It Low
[35:42] he led it low even to the ground he
[35:48] bringeth it even to the dust six
[35:57] together the way of the Justice
[36:00] uprightness thou most upright do his way
[36:05] the path of the jest God bless the
[36:08] reasons words you may be seated
[36:13] he says in the eighth verse yea in the
[36:17] way of thou judgment O Lord
[36:20] have we waited for thee the desires of
[36:24] our soul
[36:26] is to thy name
[36:29] and to the remember to the remembrance
[36:33] of Thee amen
[36:38] your soul has a desire amen
[36:43] perfect peace
[36:46] perfect peace
[36:49] we just don't want just peace but
[36:52] perfect peace
[36:55] you know I thought about you know we
[36:58] were praying and seeking God just what
[37:00] way we were going
[37:01] in a troubled world
[37:04] amen
[37:07] in chaotic conditions and
[37:10] in our communities in our cities and
[37:13] everywhere you turn there's trouble
[37:15] there's something going on
[37:19] I was telling uh
[37:22] somebody uh just saying that the
[37:25] earthquake that hit Mexico
[37:27] seven point something the other week I
[37:30] said all it had to do was just come down
[37:31] a little farther
[37:33] and hit California in the east in the
[37:35] whole West Coast would have been taken
[37:37] out
[37:38] millions of people would have gone just
[37:40] like that it's getting closer
[37:45] you know
[37:47] and looking at peace
[37:52] and I was just thinking of what peace
[37:55] means is
[37:56] Freedom From War
[38:00] sometimes when you speak of Peace you
[38:02] want something to be quiet and
[38:05] Tranquility uh you know something that's
[38:08] you want to be safe
[38:11] it seemed like
[38:13] there's no place safe now
[38:18] but the Bible tells us
[38:21] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[38:23] the righteous running thing into their
[38:25] safe
[38:30] you don't feel secured anywhere
[38:35] there's no security nothing is secured
[38:38] your your money in the bank is not
[38:40] secured you a 401k is not secure though
[38:44] your stocks and your bonds it ain't
[38:46] secured your job is not security you
[38:48] don't have security
[38:50] so if you're not secured then you then
[38:53] that's a that's a a certain amount of
[38:57] fear of losing
[39:00] man you can lose all your money you can
[39:02] lose your job you can lose so there's a
[39:05] field there that any time at any time
[39:09] because everything is unstable in at any
[39:12] time I can lose what I got
[39:17] right I was just looking at the battle
[39:18] that little sister Grace is going
[39:21] through right now
[39:25] she's probably not even 18 going through
[39:28] a little battle in her in her body
[39:31] anything can happen to any one of us at
[39:33] any time
[39:36] Anything Can Happen anytime no matter
[39:39] what you think about yourself and how
[39:42] well you think you're right my
[39:44] brother-in-law used to say the bishop
[39:45] used to say he said in your wellest day
[39:49] he used to say it all the time you're
[39:50] sick enough to die
[39:55] and he would always say that over and
[39:57] over in your Wellness day you're sick
[39:58] enough to die
[40:01] so anytime God can come by and call your
[40:04] number
[40:08] but there's a peace that no matter what
[40:11] comes
[40:12] or what goes
[40:14] this is what he says he says
[40:19] in the third verse and thou will keep
[40:24] him in perfect peace it's something
[40:26] about having peace but being kept
[40:30] is another thing
[40:32] God will keep him
[40:36] I want to be kept
[40:39] see some people have peace but the peace
[40:41] is not lasting
[40:45] sometimes we find security and sometimes
[40:49] we have desires that we want to fulfill
[40:51] and then when those these eyes are for
[40:54] fear amen then we sort of calm down and
[40:58] we kind of you know stabilize amen maybe
[41:01] you find the right companion maybe you
[41:05] find uh this or that it's things in life
[41:09] that causes you amen
[41:12] your restlessness is gone
[41:16] sometimes it's the right job it's the
[41:19] right fit and sometimes
[41:21] you find the trade a skill and then you
[41:25] kind of rest in that area of expectation
[41:28] the thing that you were seeking and
[41:30] trying to find and you find a place of
[41:33] contentment
[41:35] but your contentment does not last
[41:39] but he said it keeps
[41:45] he said thou will keep
[41:49] him in perfect peace
[41:52] you cannot hold to the peace here amen
[41:57] even if
[41:59] all of a sudden Russia and Ukraine
[42:02] decides that amen we're going to have a
[42:05] peace treaty
[42:06] the peace is only for season
[42:11] for the scripture said there shall be
[42:13] walls and rumors of walls
[42:17] the earthquakes and divers different
[42:19] places divers places
[42:22] we kind of get around the scripture it's
[42:24] going to happen
[42:28] there'll be pestilence and famines
[42:32] we can't get around Corona or whatever
[42:34] it's something that's coming because
[42:37] that's the way the end time is going to
[42:39] be and we're in the end time and amen we
[42:42] know that these times have come perilous
[42:45] time dangerous times it's death
[42:51] because of Peace because
[42:56] there's a light
[42:58] of trust
[43:01] and the one that can give you perfect
[43:03] peace
[43:06] you must have enough confidence in the
[43:09] one that can give you that perfect peace
[43:14] see he says here that
[43:18] thou will give him
[43:21] perfect peace whose mind is stead on him
[43:24] because he what
[43:28] see the reason why we're so it's so
[43:32] chaotic and life is so difficult amen no
[43:35] matter how what you're searching and
[43:37] what you think that you want you still
[43:40] don't have the peace that you desire
[43:44] because why because it's a lack of trust
[43:49] that we trust in him
[43:53] but if we trust him we know that he will
[43:58] teach
[43:59] that's in perfect peace
[44:02] the scripture that I quote all the time
[44:04] I was happy I was glad when they said
[44:06] unto me let us go into the house of the
[44:09] Lord songs or 122.
[44:13] usually when the church I came out of
[44:15] this was the what we quoted every Sunday
[44:21] in Psalms 122.
[44:25] he said I was glad I was happy when they
[44:27] said unto me let us go
[44:30] into the house of the Lord
[44:34] our feet should stand within thy gate so
[44:37] Jerusalem
[44:39] Jerusalem is built as a city that is
[44:42] compact together
[44:44] brother and sisters I'm just going to
[44:46] talk to you a little bit this morning
[44:48] Jerusalem is
[44:52] called the city of the great king
[44:56] when we look at Jerusalem
[44:58] he he began to describe Jerusalem the
[45:03] Jerusalem is
[45:05] built as a city that is compact together
[45:08] whether the tribes go up the tribes of

[1:17:34] in control
[1:17:36] I have that Blessed assurance
[1:17:38] that he's got it all
[1:17:41] in control
[1:17:43] you believe that
[1:17:45] he will give thee
[1:17:48] the perfect peace
[1:17:51] whose mind
[1:17:53] is dead
[1:17:56] on him
[1:17:58] it's because you put
[1:18:01] not in a man
[1:18:03] not in a church
[1:18:05] but you put your trust
[1:18:08] in him
[1:18:10] praise God
[1:18:13] just a little bit of doubt
[1:18:15] a little bit of fear
[1:18:19] because you
[1:18:21] begin to worry
[1:18:27] it'll cause you
[1:18:29] to doubt whether God cares
[1:18:32] or you understand
[1:18:36] sometimes it's what we want
[1:18:41] you put a God on a walk base
[1:18:44] he's he didn't say I give you all your
[1:18:47] wants
[1:18:48] he said but my God shall
[1:18:51] Supply what
[1:18:54] and see you put him on a warmth base
[1:18:57] and because you put him on a walk base
[1:19:00] you begin to doubt your wants
[1:19:06] and you cannot
[1:19:08] as long as you keep it in the words
[1:19:12] then you can have what you asked for
[1:19:15] are you with me
[1:19:17] but when you when you've got it on a
[1:19:19] won't face then there's a slight bit of
[1:19:21] Doubt because this is what you want
[1:19:25] and God is trying to speak to you in a
[1:19:28] way that he wants to simplify
[1:19:32] he wants to do it but
[1:19:35] he cannot do it to you your mind is
[1:19:38] transformed
[1:19:42] to to the mind that was in Christ Jesus
[1:19:47] see you got to have the right kind of
[1:19:49] mindset to get what you want from God
[1:19:51] because he said he'll supply all your
[1:19:53] needs it's got to be a based upon the
[1:19:55] word amen
[1:19:57] amen are you with that because your
[1:19:59] wants amen is in the wrong place amen
[1:20:02] because you said this is what I want
[1:20:04] amen instead of saying God I'm going to
[1:20:07] settle with you knows what's best
[1:20:10] amen you know what's best for my life
[1:20:12] you know it's what is best for me it's
[1:20:15] not what I want but it's what you know I
[1:20:18] need
[1:20:19] are you with me
[1:20:22] now how do you know you're in the will
[1:20:23] of God because you're in the word of God
[1:20:27] amen are you
[1:20:28] because when you pray you ask him
[1:20:31] according to the word not according to
[1:20:33] your wants amen
[1:20:37] and when you can get on in tune with God
[1:20:39] you can know how to petition God
[1:20:43] amen amen when you petition God you say
[1:20:48] God this is what I need
[1:20:51] you coming to God in the right kind of
[1:20:54] attitude the right way amen you can say
[1:20:56] God you promise in your word
[1:20:59] and Lord here I am I'm entrusting you
[1:21:01] and I'm standing on your word I'm
[1:21:04] standing on your promise
[1:21:07] amen and then I can have perfect
[1:21:09] confidence because I've gotten
[1:21:11] confidence in his word
[1:21:13] amen and I know that he hears me because
[1:21:16] he hears his word amen amen praise God
[1:21:20] so I got confidence that he hears me
[1:21:23] that he already had done it
[1:21:27] are you up there
[1:21:28] so there's no fear I don't have to fear
[1:21:31] I don't have the doubt because the acts
[1:21:33] according to his word
[1:21:37] why would God come in because
[1:21:39] we don't know how to come before God and
[1:21:43] ask him
[1:21:45] sometimes we're demanding what we want
[1:21:50] sometimes we think we can have it
[1:21:53] because
[1:21:56] it's what we want
[1:21:58] but sometimes we have to just calm down
[1:22:01] and settle down
[1:22:03] and say Lord
[1:22:05] what is your will
[1:22:09] and I'm willing to accept your will
[1:22:11] for whatever I'm
[1:22:14] petitioning you for
[1:22:18] what I'm asking you to do
[1:22:20] if it don't look like it's coming Timely
[1:22:24] as fast and as quick as I want it
[1:22:27] then Lord
[1:22:29] will I still trust you am I still
[1:22:31] trusting you I am I doubting whether or
[1:22:33] not you can do it
[1:22:37] do I have enough patience to trust God
[1:22:39] and spite if things get worse or things
[1:22:42] get a little chaotic do I still trust
[1:22:46] them do I still say God you still got it
[1:22:49] under control God you're still God I
[1:22:51] still believe you I'm standing on your
[1:22:52] word you promised it may take 25 years
[1:22:55] but God here I am
[1:23:02] we have a strong City
[1:23:05] amen are you with me
[1:23:08] so by the grace of God I'm asking you
[1:23:10] sometimes
[1:23:13] just let your mind be
[1:23:17] lock your spine amen and then God can
[1:23:20] challenge you here
[1:23:22] so whatever comes or goes
[1:23:26] still got peace
[1:23:28] whatever happens in this life Lord
[1:23:32] praise God I'm still confident in you
[1:23:38] don't let nothing shake your faith in
[1:23:40] God let us stand
[1:23:42] don't let nobody or nothing shake your
[1:23:45] faith amen
[1:23:48] amen Paul says None of these things move
[1:23:50] me
[1:23:54] I'm not worried about what you're
[1:23:55] telling me what's going to happen in
[1:23:57] Jerusalem amen none of these things move
[1:24:01] remote

[1:24:06] bound and he said I'm not going to
