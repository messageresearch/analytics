earth which is satan he hates the book of genesis because genesee tells the beginning genesis show what has been planned in the earth a man and that devil is mad and he hates the book of revelation because that's where the bride is at amen everything is being made known genesis 1 amen i just feel the glory of the lord hear it this morning genesis 1 and we begin to read from verse 16 amen and we go to acts 1. genesis 1 and verse 16 are we there by saying amen and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also verse 17 and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to give and to divide the light from darkness and god saw that it was

the holy ghost come upon you verse 9 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfast towards heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white appearance which also said you men of galilee why stand you engaged up into heaven the same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven to heaven he shall so come in like manners as you have seen him go into heaven then return they unto jerusalem from the mountain called olive which is from jerusalem a sabbath day journey can the church say man by the help of the lord a little thought the lord uh gave to us i i i spoke on it a few weeks ago down in the hoskey amen but uh he gave me the same thought but just give me some more input on it would that be all right amen spiritual food in due season and we just want to speak on my god going to do some great things here today how many you believe that i guarantee you if you get a hold to him and man you let him breathe on you this morning you would leave out different than the way you came in i believe that with all of my heart you know a little quick testimony as we go into my thoughts this morning is the manifestation of the moon in the absence of the sun the manifestation of the moon and the absence of the sun i was just thinking oh one day uh this week i i went to this convenience store normally i go there to warm up my lunch and uh i saw this young lady and i could tell you know she was on drugs and a man and uh i was talking to the cashier and she said uh the young lady can't even hold a job no one would hired her because of her past history her records you know no one would hire her and i said my but then i began to uh start feeling for the young lady you know i thank god for jesus this morning and young lady was trying to get a job but she you know she depthed in the world so much a man it has messed up her reputation amen and uh uh and i saw the young lady and i said how you doing she said oh i'm doing okay and she says uh i'm trying to get a job i'm trying to fill out the application but uh you know my back history is so messed up this and that i said she said i'll you know i need to get it straightened out or what have you and i said well i know someone that can help you get your your life and everything strict not she said really well who's that i said his name is jesus her whole domino's just changed she said oh well i know him uh i read my bible i go to church that's where a lot of folks they always want to point you to the church amen we're not pointing to a building amen but she said oh yeah i i know him i said have you met him she says uh yes i met him i i i talked with him i said you have i said what have he told you she said well we talked and she looked poser then because she couldn't answer me i said young lady if you ever come in contact with him i say you won't be the same anymore amen i said your whole life would change he would change you you could your whole record history i don't care if you was on drugs you was a crackhead prostitute i don't care what you were if you ever come in the presence of jesus christ and absolutely give your life completely over to him he will change you he will give you a brand new wall he will give you a brand new talk can the church say amen and i said young lady how old are you brother garden that really touched my heart because when i look at young people i think about my children you know my children could have been out there amen not because i'm a christian a man my children could have been out there i said young lady how old are you she said when i'm 20 years old hey man she had all this stuff on her face you know and and i felt that's old honey and i said i said jesus love you and she said where your church at and uh i pray god that one day she'll come amen and god could turn on and turn the light will y'all pray with me i forget her name amen but you heard my my testimony i prayed that god would do something for that young lady because we'll soon church it's getting ready to leave here we can't stay here on this earth much longer you said brother children i have been hearing that for a long time but that's all right the more you hear it the more it builds my uh uh uh build me to have me more encouraging the lord can the church say amen i just want to deal with amen uh amen the manifestation of the moon and the absence of the sun can you say amen you know the word the the the the moon uh give full strength in the absence of the sun can you say amen amen now i wrote here amen the sun and the moon in genesis 1 and 16. when god began to create the different planet god spoke and he had a thought first of all god had a thought god is just not someone that just speak things has hazardly amen so he know that he's god and he's he controlled everything so god spoke amen and the bible let us know and when god spoke that the bible let us know it was total darkness amen but everything was out a shape form avoid are you with me this morning amen i'm going to preach this morning i feel the presence of the lord y'all got to stay with me now but when god looked out there god said let there be and there was amen now first of all god had confidence in his word now you can't speak something and look for it to come to pass and you don't have confidence in it you say what you talking about brother children when you speak something you need to know that the mind of god somebody say man i give you for instance i don't want to leave off my thoughts amen but when moses went down to egypt egypt was a type of the world and this has never happened before moses said let there be flies flies never have come on the earth like that but what happened flies and fleas and frogs everywhere you know why because that was god thought that was god's mind when god spoke amen moses tapped into the very thought of god now what if moses would have said let there come fly and there wasn't no flies that wasn't god's thought so this morning the bride of jesus christ have to have the mind of god in this last in evil day can the church say amen i don't see my wife where's my wife at where's your hands we are praise the lord everybody got a mask everybody want to call you count to tell who is who amen i have to look at your hair and see you know i can praise god hallelujah how many you love the lord this morning amen amen but god is good amen but the prophet of god let us know uh now i'm just going to be me i'm not about preachers i've i've seen too many bald preachers amen i want to say what the holy ghost is going to say now and i'm sure brother gordon if i could just be me this morning you know i don't want to be an impersonator i don't want to act like this something person i don't want to stand i want to be just the way god made me amen look i can't be george washington and george washington can't be me i can't be barack obama and barack obama cannot be me there's only one me can the church say amen there's only one you i'm not going to try to impersonate nobody it's too late now i'm not trying to please man either and you just don't like it i'm sorry so be it amen because i love him and you don't love him so be it that's your business but i love him i love him all my heart i love this message with all of my heart i know the message that's not takes and quote the but the message is christ and you are in christ by one spirit are we all baptized into the body you know i'm not going to be a certain way i go at a certain person house and you know if i go to this brother how you know i'm afraid to speak what i believe the devil is a liar if i'm a muslim you're going to know i'm a muslim if i'm a jehovah witness uh you're gonna know that i'm a jehovah witness if i'm a baptist i'm gonna you're gonna know that i'm a baptist but if i'm a christian you're gonna know that i'm a christian now you know brother and sister there's two types of christians the word christ christians mean christ like there's one act like a christian amen but lord let me have the fullness can the church say amen amen i don't want to leave off my thought amen will you pray with me and you see how god create and god said let there be and there was now i i love this brother god when when god got confidence in his word when god stepped out there uh you know that great fountain of light when god said let there be and there was but then god had a plan now my goodness just be i mean before we even got here god had a plan god wanted divided the land from the earth god wanted to make the earth now god is not an ignorant god god don't make uh the fist then he makes the water god makes the water then god create the fish are you hearing me god created the earth then he took man out of that dimension and put man on earth so when god created the earth god in his mind god said now i'm gonna have some botany life on earth in order for botany life to live and for things to live and grow god said i got to make a sign are you hearing me so god by his dog he spoke and the son just went out there and create oh my amen when god spoke the sun 93 billion miles million miles in its orbits and it's hanging even today so god made the greater light to shine on the earth and then god said now wait a minute so god when then he made 200 and some thousand miles into space god made the lesser light which was the moon can the church say amen do you love him for it oh my amen now all things are shadows and types now what the star does the star gives lesser light that's right what does the star shine from if i could walk out tonight and see that great bright uh star yonder shining uh i would say little star you show a beautiful thing what make you shine that way well if that little star of that stalker talked with me it would say brother brown i'm not shining he said well what make you shine he said if it's something shining on me see it's the sun shining on me brother browner i just happen to uh light up the path for you that's where we got to be right well then the true pastor in the pulpit if he's anointed of god he is not the pastor shining it's not him it's it is the it's not the good preacher it's not him it's the light that's shining are you with me this morning amen so we're giving all glory to god amen and one thing about us amen amen i i i was talking to brother god he came in the back early this morning and we began to talk and i just look at him and god knows it's true when i look at him he just have a globe about him i said well god how old are you and he told me his age i said man you sure look good and you know what he did i know he know what got him looking like that it's the sun that's shining on him got him looking the way he looks somebody say man and that's the way you got to be in this hour amen you got to stay under the presence of the son so when god made the sign it's just like husband and wife that's what the prophet said amen he said the wife is the lesser life which is the weaker vessel y'all go with me on that come on with somebody come on follow me this morning amen and he made a greater life amen is the husband he said tight christ and the church are you hearing me christ and the church amen and the bible let us know amen how the sunlight can you imagine living in a world without sunlight you know they tell me i i had the opportunity to go to uh 2017 in 2018 we went out to anchorage alaska and amen the first time i got there you know i'm used to amen where i live i'm normally you know daybreak's about 6 30 seven o'clock perhaps in the uh well anyway i was uh when i got to anchorage amen i got up that morning as i would normally get up you know used to getting up early but the strange thing it meant at eight o'clock it was pitch dark on the outside i said mine so i kind of wait maybe the sun will break and there wasn't no sun it was 8 30. there was no sun it was just dark well i'm from down south so what i had to do amen i went outside and i began to walk around the neighborhood they got ice and snow everywhere so i walked around the neighborhood and my breathing started and man my breath i started losing my breathing and then realized the brother told me that because of the attitude and the climate it was so cold and i wasn't dressed properly amen for that type of weather and i could look today amen the reason why people are freezing spiritually because they'll not dress properly for this type of weather are you hearing me well you see people getting tired and going back amen to the world because they're not dressed properly for this type of weather it's a coldness has swept everywhere but amen but i thank god i'm a burning fire amen i thank god for his love amen i thank god for his compassion amen can i just preach this morning amen can i just preach like i'm home i told you i'm going to be me now i will kick my shoes off amen but i'll be polite cannot be at home this morning amen and one thing about god when god made the earth god made the sun to shine and when the sun began to shine brother brother god it began to when it shines it will cause botany life to grow somebody say amen amen i mean you just thank god when you go outside sometime perhaps in the morning you know you're feeling all gloomy and it's dark on the outside well anyway in alaska it don't get day break until about 9 30 9 o'clock so i wasn't used to that different different state amen was different but if you would go outside this morning in the morning and you look at the grass when the sun raises up and it wakes up amen brought in the life and you would look over in the grass you would see the little little grass just just shining anybody know what i'm talking about if you my age you've seen it before amen and a little grass just sparkling this sparkling amen even though you step on the grass and you look back brother guard it still just said hallelujah i just been stepping on but i'm shining but you know why the grass is shining because if the grass could say hey man that little it's a little grass little dew drop excuse me the drew drop dew drop just as shiny but if the dew drops could only speak to me i said dude draw man you guys shining you're having a revival early in the morning like this if they could just speak and say brother children the reason why we are shining so bright y'all stay with me amen amen the reason why we are shining so bright amen now now i've been to a lot of church and and i've seen a lot of folks y'all let me preach a man i i've seen do you know uh uh you could you could cut your oxygen off you count to breathe and when you cut your ocean off you can't breathe you go to sleep so leave it just enough so you can breathe too amen i need somebody to say man but if the body life y'all love this kind of preaching though but if the body life could say you know why we are shining because soon in the morning when the sun rises up we're going back up to where we come from hallelujah and i don't know about you but i'm not gonna let the thing i might go through some battle i might go through some battles i might go through some trial but i'm going to be just like bartending like i ain't going to let nothing hinder me hallelujah church of the living god i'm gonna keep on praising god can the church say amen amen even though the light is not shining amen but i thank god for his grace i thank god for his glory i thank god for his mercy i mean you thank god for his mercy i thank god for keeping me amen in the dark time god was there all the time when you got discouraged sometimes god was there all the time but i thank god for the sunlight man i don't know what it would be like amen if i would wake up in the morning it just pitch dark 12 o'clock it's pitch dark i'm going to walmart 7 00 a.m in the morning it's pitch dark man it'd be miserable i've lived for to be almost 62 years and i love the way god made the earth when god made the earth i'm so happy to know amen when god made the sun to rule the day and he made the stars he made he made the moon the globe in the absence of the sun are y'all y'all praying with me you know you look at the stars the stars that shining the prophet god said you could see those two stars he said they look like they're they're so far away and it looked like they're like about an inch away he said there are so many miles and miles and hundreds of miles apart but to think about the great god and the star began to just shine at night and you said to yourself you know i could go outside sometime and i could look to a certain place in the universe i said there's that bright star amen but if that star go on and say look look look brother children i don't want to take this glory i'm not shining i said well what you got what makes you shiny he said it's not me he said i'm getting my reflection from off of the sun hallelujah now if there's anything shining about you this morning it's the glory of god in this hour somebody say man you know what church and living god you got to love the lord god with

she might they might be got some more teachers in here animal teachers in here but i think the sun 93 million miles in its orbits and it's been hanging ever since it hasn't moved it's been hanging out there ever since to give light to the earth and god gave that moon the shine at night and control things at night you know the moon controlled the ocean the tide high tide you watch the moon i've seen a lot of time even my grandbaby's six years old i don't know where she get this from she was riding with me she said papa she said somebody some somebody gonna have a baby i said why you say that grandbaby she said because it's a full moon [Laughter] oh praise god oh my my she says go they say somebody gonna have uh a baby tonight i said really amen but then but that moon just think about it's it's you leave out the church tonight i'm not going to hold you tonight now but if we would leave out a church at night time and you go outside and it's pitch dark you you can't even see your car there ain't nothing shining it's just dark but see god made the moon to give the lesser light and brother brown said that's when it shines at its best when it's complete darkness that's when the moon seemed like it give it full strength are you hearing me but what if we was living what if the moon wasn't shining it would be miserable i thank god for it the way he made everything how he made the planets and you know when you look at the moon i you know i've been looking at the moon way back in the days as a little boy i seen the moon look like it got them different spots on it and i was a little boy it looked like the moon face were changing and you know and and the prophet of god said what is what has happened what you see is the reflecting of that sun that's shining on that moon and causing it to look like mountains and things like that how many you think god amen the moon began to shine in the absence of the sun and what has happened is the sun is so large you know i just realized and i'm not ashamed to say i didn't realize how large how large the sun was to the earth how small the little earth is how do you know that i didn't realize that brother gordon i did i know there was a sun all my life i never knew the sun was that huge it hangs out there and it give light and a little tiny little earth and god let that sun come over the earth and cause botany life cause things to grow how do you think god shine his light on you cause you to grow amen and one thing about the sun when it shines it burns up things also sometimes it burns the call in the season of the of the weather it causes the grass to burn and just wither away and i believe that we're living in the hour amen i don't know about you this morning amen but i thank god for the sunlight amen that's shining on me but when the sun begins to shine over the earth it give light to botany life and light began to spring up the corn the vegetables the plants everything began to blossom i wonder how the flowers would look if there wasn't sunlight you look at the beautiful flower god allow his sunlight to shine on it y'all come on go with me we we're going somewhere now but you got to go with me and you got to let and you look at the sun when it begins to shine then the moon and when the sun goes away in the absence of the sun that moon begins to shine so bright and you realize man that's a bright moon that moon is not shining it's getting its reflection off of the sun and this morning if there's any globe about you this morning amen it's because you're in the presence of the s-o-n it's only because i told brother god and i said man how old are you you probably want to tell his age amen i said brother god how old are you he told me his age i said man you sure look mighty good you
