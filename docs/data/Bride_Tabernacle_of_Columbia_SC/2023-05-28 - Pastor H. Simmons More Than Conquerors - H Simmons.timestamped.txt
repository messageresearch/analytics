[57:39] that the devil offers us
[57:42] amen and we'll call and we'll make do
[57:45] amen with the things that the devil
[57:48] offer us when God got so much better
[57:54] so he said in My Father's House of many
[57:56] mansions in my father's Kingdom there

[58:00] would have told you
[58:02] they met God God Amen praise God

[59:27] problems do all types of means besides
[59:31] coming to Jesus and said Jesus I knew
[59:34] you were the answer
[59:39] but we try all types of means all types
[59:42] of things now in Colossians 1
[59:45] um
[59:46] praise God
[59:48] he said
[59:51] I I'm just going to skip over a lot of
[59:54] things and go to the 27 verse 1 27 to
[59:58] whom God will make known
[1:00:01] what is the richest of the glory of this
[1:00:04] mystery to the Gentiles

[1:01:10] Moses those came out of Egypt that was
[1:01:13] their journey and that was their day
[1:01:15] not when Noah built the ark that was
[1:01:18] their day
[1:01:19] praise God we talk about the Patriots
[1:01:21] and Abraham and Jacob and so forth that
[1:01:25] was their time
[1:01:26] we talk about John the Baptist that was
[1:01:29] his time

[1:01:49] foundation of the world he fought knew
[1:01:51] you
[1:01:52] and by full knowledge knowing that you
[1:01:55] would come in this hour and you would
[1:01:58] recognize the voice of God that would
[1:02:00] speak to your heart for the hour you
[1:02:02] live in
[1:02:04] are you up now
[1:02:06] so God Amen in his mind knew the
[1:02:10] Temptations and the things amen that you
[1:02:13] were facing the challenges of the hour
[1:02:16] he knew that all the Demons of hell
[1:02:19] would mind up their wings on the pale
[1:02:21] horse rider and death and hell would
[1:02:23] rise
[1:02:25] are you with me
[1:02:26] but in the midst of death and Hell
[1:02:29] riding amen God knew that you needed an
[1:02:32] eagle anointing
[1:02:34] to Fly Above the pear horse rider
[1:02:38] are you with me
[1:02:40] so God in his wisdom amen prepared when
[1:02:44] the enemy come in like a flood amen the
[1:02:47] spirit of the Lord will live up a
[1:02:50] standard
[1:02:51] against the devil

[1:02:55] with
[1:02:56] amen and God got to reveal what you need
[1:03:00] to fight within this hour
[1:03:02] other than that amen you building the
[1:03:05] ark won't worry

[1:03:45] of the Bible said Faith come our hearing
[1:03:49] and hearing the word of God
[1:03:51] so how can you get
[1:03:53] you need faith for healing
[1:03:55] then you need faithful rapture
[1:03:58] are you up there
[1:04:00] so usually when you're dealing with
[1:04:03] faith for healing
[1:04:04] amen will bring a message that would
[1:04:07] deal with faith to get you to a place
[1:04:10] where you can receive your healing
[1:04:12] amen
[1:04:14] but when we're dealing with faith for
[1:04:17] you to believe that the blood of Jesus

[1:04:27] God that you might not have a miserable
[1:04:30] life
[1:04:31] a sin
[1:04:32] but God wants to deliver you from the
[1:04:35] power
[1:04:40] of sin and death
[1:04:42] amen and give your life
[1:04:44] eternal life
[1:04:46] you know folks uh they look at eternal
[1:04:48] life and it doesn't mean nothing because
[1:04:50] they were not ordained to believe it
[1:04:55] the reason why folks won't receive Jesus
[1:04:57] because they wouldn't ordained to
[1:04:59] believe it
[1:05:00] as in 13th chapter of Acts those were
[1:05:03] the ordained to eternal life they
[1:05:05] believe
[1:05:06] are you with me the rest of them they
[1:05:09] heard it they walked away as though they
[1:05:11] heard nothing
[1:05:12] but those that were attained to eternal
[1:05:15] life please
[1:05:17] amen they believe that Jesus had come
[1:05:20] and done what nobody could do
[1:05:23] the second character free to heal the
[1:05:26] broken heart

[1:05:31] gospel
[1:05:32] amen it's nothing we don't try to put on
[1:05:35] a whole lot of stuff for the young
[1:05:37] people amen because the gospel is the
[1:05:39] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[1:05:41] to believe
[1:05:43] praise God the word of God did not lose
[1:05:46] his power amen it's the same gospel that
[1:05:49] saved me it's the same gospel that'll
[1:05:52] save you
[1:05:53] praise God God don't need to add to his
[1:05:55] word or take anything away from it if
[1:05:58] you believe the gospel he'll set you
[1:06:00] free
[1:06:01] praise God he'll give you the joy that
[1:06:03] you need the peace that you need oh
[1:06:06] he'll give you the stamina that you need
[1:06:09] to stand up and say thank you Lord
[1:06:12] oh I'm not ashamed of the Gospel Jesus
[1:06:15] Christ because it is the power of God to
[1:06:17] Salvation to everyone that believe
[1:06:20] Hallelujah
[1:06:21] praise God folks one a lot of things but
[1:06:24] they don't want Jesus we're living in a
[1:06:27] world that don't want Jesus
[1:06:30] they don't love him and they don't want
[1:06:31] him
[1:06:32] in their mouth they say I love him but
[1:06:35] in the action they turn him away
[1:06:37] brother and sister if we love him why
[1:06:40] don't we receive Jesus
[1:06:42] amen
[1:06:44] if we believe that he died for our sin
[1:06:47] why don't we let him into our hearts
[1:06:50] in other words folks
[1:06:53] um I believe
[1:06:54] but they won't receive
[1:06:56] they shake their head and they'll walk
[1:06:58] away
[1:06:59] but yet they say well I believe
[1:07:01] if we believe then we ought to be
[1:07:03] willing to receive him
[1:07:05] we ought to be able to welcome him
[1:07:08] are you with me
[1:07:10] and if we welcome Jesus into our hearts
[1:07:12] we'll find that our life
[1:07:15] the heavy load that we've been carrying
[1:07:17] are we lifting
[1:07:19] a lot of the challenges a lot of things
[1:07:21] we go through is because we reject God
[1:07:26] we try to make a better plan a better
[1:07:29] way of life
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:32] we try to better ourselves and better
[1:07:35] Our Lives
[1:07:36] we get more schooling better education
[1:07:39] better jobs and we live in a better
[1:07:42] neighborhood and drive a better car or
[1:07:45] whatever you know what I'm saying we try
[1:07:47] to better ourselves nothing wrong with
[1:07:49] those things
[1:07:50] but
[1:07:51] without God
[1:07:54] what what does it mean
[1:07:56] when you don't have God what does it
[1:07:58] mean
[1:07:59] it don't mean a thing isn't that right
[1:08:01] but the whole purpose of you being in
[1:08:05] the earth is the worship and serve God
[1:08:09] that's why he says seek you first to
[1:08:11] what
[1:08:12] kingdom of God and his what
[1:08:14] righteousness and what
[1:08:17] all other things would be
[1:08:20] but to see what what we want we want all
[1:08:23] those other things
[1:08:24] we want all those other things but we
[1:08:26] don't want Jesus
[1:08:28] amen why we want all those other things
[1:08:31] when we can have all those other things

[1:08:40] have preeminence in your life
[1:08:42] are you with me
[1:08:44] but
[1:08:46] we're more than conquerors
[1:08:49] through him that loved us
[1:08:51] because he loved us he died for us
[1:08:55] he showed us that he cared for us
[1:08:58] brother and sister
[1:09:01] I'm saying here this morning
[1:09:04] this is the victory that overcomes the
[1:09:06] world
[1:09:08] even how
[1:09:10] faith
[1:09:12] faith in God makes a difference
[1:09:16] faith and trust in believe in him taking
[1:09:20] him at his word it makes a difference in
[1:09:24] our lives
[1:09:25] if you fail to accept
[1:09:28] what Jesus died for
[1:09:31] if somebody said if I die and my soul is
[1:09:35] lost it's nobody fault but mine
[1:09:41] now brother and sister
