[37:42] The Book of Romans 2
[37:46] brother
[37:49] um Gene from Boynton Beach Florida sent
[37:53] his greetings brother Jack from West
[37:56] Palms and his greetings and the Saints
[37:58] there
[37:59] brother Bernard from Miami
[38:02] they send their greetings for Miami
[38:05] so we had a chance to Fellowship through
[38:08] the week to
[38:10] those particular fellowships and
[38:14] and everybody's it's the greatest thanks
[38:16] for them and
[38:19] we just sister Hannah and Brother David
[38:21] we stayed with them while we were down
[38:24] and said that greetings also
[38:28] and Trinidad brother Paul from Trinidad
[38:33] The Book of Romans 2 and 27 it said
[38:41] it says here 28 excuse me 28. for he's
[38:45] not a Jew which is one hourly neither is
[38:49] that circumcision which is one
[38:52] which is outwardly in the flesh
[38:55] but he is a Jew which is in with one
[38:58] inwardly
[38:59] circumcision that is of the heart in the
[39:03] spirit and not in the letter whose
[39:07] phrase is not of men but of God
[39:09] may God bless you read this word you may
[39:11] be seated
[39:16] in a time like this where people are
[39:19] seeking identity
[39:23] they want to be identified with
[39:27] the ancestors and where they came from
[39:29] and who are they
[39:31] and there's a big
[39:33] move among even Black America but the
[39:37] black Jews and the everywhere
[39:39] so people are fighting
[39:42] and they're becoming angry and
[39:44] frustrated because
[39:46] people want to be Jews
[39:50] and who are the real Jews or whether
[39:52] they
[39:53] uh the ones that's over in Israel now or
[39:58] the ones that are on Wall Street and so
[40:01] forth
[40:02] Jews
[40:03] so the question is
[40:06] what does it mean to you and I to be a
[40:09] Jew
[40:10] who are the real Jews
[40:13] so by the grace of God and
[40:17] because
[40:19] people are associated being the Jew with
[40:24] God's chosen people God's blessed people
[40:27] and God's promises
[40:30] the Jew
[40:33] realize that God made promises
[40:37] and promised to bless them
[40:41] so they'll look at
[40:45] God's chosen
[40:47] and we're especially and inside of God
[40:49] we are blessed
[40:51] but who are the real Jews
[40:53] here Romans Paul speaks of
[40:59] like this he says he's not a Jew that's
[41:01] one awfully
[41:04] and
[41:05] as we speak of in the message of that
[41:07] was the Bride of Jesus Christ
[41:11] so who's the real bride
[41:15] and look at the Christian world who are
[41:18] the real Christians
[41:22] so it's many Avenues we could look at
[41:26] that because
[41:28] as we look at the Jews who are the Jews
[41:32] just ask your question are you a
[41:34] Christian
[41:36] well you're a real Christian
[41:38] are you
[41:41] someone like Paul
[41:44] he was a Jew hourly
[41:47] he thought that
[41:49] he was living according to the law
[41:55] and he was trying to do his best to keep
[41:58] the law
[42:00] he was schooled
[42:01] to
[42:02] in the learning of the law
[42:06] and everything
[42:08] you got a Zeal of God
[42:11] here in Romans 10
[42:18] and Romans 10
[42:21] Paul began to set my he said brother in
[42:25] my heart desire and prayer to God for
[42:28] Israel that there might be what
[42:31] save
[42:37] D you know I I come to a point that
[42:41] it's it's the harder
[42:43] that God is looking for
[42:50] we wonder why we can't get people to
[42:52] live right and do right and no matter
[42:56] how hard you preach how hard you teach
[43:01] it doesn't matter what you say to them
[43:05] sometimes we deal with how we dress how
[43:07] we look how we talk how we walk
[43:12] but all on that
[43:14] we can labor us hard prayer fast in
[43:17] everything go through all emotions
[43:21] but of our heart not right
[43:26] amen don't have a problem with the
[43:28] people that got the right kind of hard
[43:32] a lot of folks are twisted up
[43:36] in their minds
[43:39] and everybody's trying to be a Christian
[43:42] according to their own interpretation of
[43:44] what a Christian is
[43:50] Paul had his own
[43:53] upbringing as a chew and tried his best
[43:57] to live blameless
[44:02] some folks honestly to surely would you
[44:06] have others just going through the
[44:07] motion
[44:08] they have not really dedicated to what
[44:11] they really supposed to believe
[44:15] you got others that are just going
[44:17] through the motion they care less about
[44:20] what they supposed to believe they're
[44:22] living their own life doing their own
[44:25] thing
[44:26] yet they identify because it's the
[44:29] family
[44:31] it's the traditional thing to do
[44:34] so we have those that identify by family
[44:37] and almost that they've been born in a
[44:41] certain family and this is a religion of
[44:44] the family
[44:47] so people keep the tradition of the
[44:49] family and they never come into a real
[44:53] experience with God
[44:57] that's what happens many of times that
[45:00] people but Paul it's even though he had
[45:04] such a dedication that amen that what he
[45:09] had been taught was rooted and built in
[45:12] him he he had some stamina that he stood
[45:15] for something
[45:17] used to be when I was a boy if you were
[45:19] a Baptist you try to defend what you
[45:22] believe if you were a Methodist you
[45:24] defend what you believe and you stood
[45:26] for what you supposed to believe you try
[45:28] to understand what it took and you know
[45:31] but not and so you could
[45:34] come and bring the word and sit down
[45:37] with folks with the Bible and open up
[45:40] your Bible and start turning here and
[45:43] showing them in the Bible where they
[45:45] need the the baptism in the name of the
[45:48] Lord Jesus Christ and so forth and
[45:50] showing them the word where they need
[45:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you
[45:55] can turn in your Bible
[45:57] show folks what the Bible say listen
[46:00] yeah I believe that
[46:03] and they just smile
[46:05] and they're going about
[46:07] doing their own thing
[46:11] because they go through the church they
[46:14] say love everybody just love everybody
[46:17] you know you know it doesn't make a
[46:20] difference does it
[46:22] but it used to be
[46:27] denomination you stood for that
[46:31] but you can't it's difficult for people
[46:35] Amen to really see the Bible and and the
[46:39] word and walk in it now
[46:41] it's different to see light and begin to
[46:44] walk in the light as you see light
[46:48] people just sit back and they stare at
[46:50] it yeah I see exactly what you're saying
[46:53] mm-hmm
[46:55] thank you and go on about their business
[46:59] but it used to be a time where people
[47:01] saw light and they wanted to walk in it
[47:04] oh my church not saying that my preacher
[47:08] ain't saying that oh this is this Bible
[47:10] oh thank you
[47:14] and people wanted to they left churches
[47:17] they left their denomination they left
[47:20] whatever
[47:21] and then what what the scripture say
[47:24] now thank you
[47:29] I'm just satisfied with just
[47:31] you know I I can go to heaven just like
[47:33] I am anyway
[47:35] you know
[47:36] it's no church perfect it's it's no uh
[47:41] uh nobody's perfect you know everybody
[47:44] got something wrong with them
[47:47] and that's the way people are today
[47:49] people said in the message of the hour
[47:52] said oh everybody got something you know
[47:55] nobody's got it all nobody's there
[47:58] nobody's just holy enough
[48:01] you know it's a I look at what the
[48:04] prophet was saying
[48:06] he said be perfect
[48:08] that's what Jesus said be perfect as
[48:10] your father which is in heaven is
[48:11] perfect isn't that right
[48:14] but we have an excuse for not being
[48:16] perfect
[48:17] your Perfection is not that uh
[48:21] see when the Jews came and opened up a
[48:24] sacrifice sacrifice had to be without
[48:27] spot without blemish without wrinkle
[48:29] anything that sacrifice you had to
[48:32] examine it and make sure the sacrifice
[48:34] is perfect
[48:37] are you up man
[48:38] and because of our sacrifice it's
[48:42] perfect the Lamb of God is our perfect
[48:45] sacrifice
[48:49] are you a man
[48:50] and when we amen when we even put our
[48:54] hand on we our faith in that lamb
[48:58] that sacrifice
[49:03] we are perfected in him
[49:06] a European
[49:08] it's because of our sacrifice
[49:10] nothing that we can do nothing that we
[49:12] have done but our abortion is in him
[49:17] praise God it's because of what he's
[49:19] done
[49:21] makes me who I am
[49:24] are you up man
[49:26] without him I'm nothing
[49:29] praise God because I'm a Son of God
[49:33] because of my sacrifice
[49:35] [Music]
[49:39] because he sacrificed his life for me
[49:43] I got overhead on my story I thought I
[49:45] picked that up
[49:48] but
[49:49] we're dealing with Jews do you know what
[49:52] real Christians real Jews
[49:55] sometimes
[49:57] you said my heart desired prayer to God
[49:59] than the Israel said it might be saved
[50:02] and I'll tell you something
[50:04] you and I will you know great
[50:08] conflict
[50:10] amen a battle
[50:13] and your heart desire to but Israel now
[50:18] and for the people of God it might be
[50:20] saved
[50:22] but I'll tell you
[50:24] she looked on the horizon folks don't
[50:26] care about their soul
[50:30] they care more about everything but
[50:33] their soul their soul is not valuable
[50:35] it's not important to them
[50:39] no matter how much you care about their
[50:42] soul they don't care about their own
[50:45] soul
[50:48] for where your tragedy is
[50:52] there will your heart be
[50:54] they care more about what they're going
[50:57] to achieve in this world and in this
[51:00] life than they care about eternal life
[51:06] you can't convince them
[51:08] to love God
[51:11] so
[51:12] he said about Israel he says for the I
[51:15] dialed them record that they have a Zeal
[51:18] of God but not according to knowledge
[51:19] for they being ignorant of God rights
