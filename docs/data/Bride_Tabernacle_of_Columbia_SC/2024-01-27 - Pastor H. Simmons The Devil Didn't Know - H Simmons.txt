Lord father those that on this prayer list those that are sick and those that are afflicted Lord ask you to meet every need in the building Lord and every hand that's been lifted Lord every heart that's open oh God we pray God that you'll say something to us that help us on this journey in Jesus Christ's Name Lord bless your word amen the book of uh Matthew four just something I was sharing a little bit down in Mullins last night we were thought I would Minister at Sunday but God knows says I said the devil did not did not know he didn't know that's what we chose for the subject tonight the devil didn't know says then was Jesus L up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward hunger the devil catch you at your weakest points and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread the devil was saying if meaning he wasn't show prop God was bringing that out but he said but he answered and said it is written man should not live by bread alone but by what every word that proceeded out the mouth of God then the devil taketh him up unto the holy city and sth him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down okay he coming back at him with the word for it's written you see what he's doing he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up least at any time thou shall Das thy foot against a stone and here Jesus reply Jesus said in him it's what it's it's written again okay you got to be sharp in your word thou shallal not what temp the Lord thy God the devil ain't going to leave you alone look at him again and again the devil taketh them up until an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the what the devil showed you everything out there show you the whole world but it's going to cost you something show them all the kingdoms of the world but he said what I want you to do I want you to do something show them all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and said unto him all these things will I what give you for what see see the devil ain't giving you what you got for nothing you got to worship Him the devil give it to you but you got to worship him all this I give to you but you got to worship Him are you with me then said Jesus unto him get the hint Satan for what it is written thou shall Worship the Lord what th God Jesus knew who he was the Lord thy God in him what you got that kind of mind God bless you may be seated are you determined to Worship the Lord thy God and him only are you going to worship the devil the devil going to give you some St yes he'll give you some things but you got to worship Him are you with somebody say I ain't worship no devil he showed them all the kingdoms of the world and the glory thereof he said now all this I'm going give to you but you going to what see the devil don't have to give some folk much he can just give you a little and you'll be satisfied just with a little bit y'all know what he's offering you and y'all know what it takes I don't want to go to church no more I don't want to serve the Lord no more cu the devil offering yourself why you going to give up I I I I cuz I I I the devil offer you something but he said I'm GNA give it to you but one thing I want to give it to you for you going to have to Bow Down and Worship me are you with me but the devil was messing with the wrong one isn't that right even though the devil could come back at him with the word Jesus could come back at him with the word it's written that's why the Bible says study to show thyself approved unto God of work needed not to be ashamed ain't that right some people just come to church they don't study some people want the preacher to do all the study for Mama to do all the study Daddy to do all the study wife to do all the studyy but they ain't going to do nothing they just come to church they just come to church don't even read their Bible leave it at church I read mine on my phone that just Alibi did I say Alibi you know what I'm saying you know you don't read it put it in the corner re about every day God so love the word gave I read my Bible today pray every day Lord bless me today thank you for Lord you know really having uh a desire to please God the devil wasn't sure now I want to talk about creating an atmosphere of perfect love creating an atmosphere of a perfect love the devil didn't know and devil doesn't know now and my question is do you know I said the devil didn't know but do you know do you know what the devil didn't know are you with me I said the devil didn't know he said if if you be what if you be if you if you're God how many of y'all say God if you if you're real if you're this if you're that then Lord I want you to prove it to me prove it to me you sound like come on prove it to me Lord if if you does he have to does he need to God I want to know if you're real I want to know if you if you are then I want to know if you are God then tell me CU I want to know whether I need to serve you or whether I need to worship you or not but if you if you're real if it is if if it is a God then God the devil didn't know the Bible said the devil believed and his he trembles right and Legion said to Jesus I know who you are that's Son of God right but he turn here and you don't know then he said Paul I know Jesus I know son of Ste scha but who are you but I said the devil didn't know but I said do you know what the devil don't know I said creating an atmosphere of perfect love propably God said if we had perfect love then there would be a sick person can come through that door that wouldn't be healed are you with me now I was saying to Mar last night you might think that uh how can I have perfect love how how can I get it how do I how how can I be assured that I have perfect love I was telling them about a a minister down in Florida years ago and I was ministering on forgiving and I there's about 300 people there and years later a little white sister came up to me in a meeting years later and she says you are brother Simmons aren't you I said yes she says the meeting you spoke down in Florida at sister and sister a church years ago I knew it was a few hundred people there maybe two or 300 she says when you spoke that sermon on forgiveness she said I was suffering with migrain headaches for years and she said when you spoke it and you explain about forgiveness she said immediately I forgave and I didn't have my migrain headaches after that I was healed sometimes we are carrying sin around or unforgiveness around thinking that we were walking in Victory thinking that you you know things are just happening to us in our lives just happening so so but some things amen the devil can have access to you and bring things upon your body a lot of folk have hard trouble and different things because amen sometimes it we're dealing with forgiveness sometime people uh uh have the the Bible said men Hearts to fail because of fear but he says perfect love what cast out fear because fear has tormented fears of the what of the devil isn't that right so uh how can I have perfect love he's saying don't fear don't fear but how can I not fear when I I become a ustom to fear I get afraid easy but you telling me if I'm going to have perfect love then I can cast out fear okay so by the grace of God we we want to be lifted up and we want to walk out of hear not that the preacher got to lay his hands on us not that the preacher got to pray for us but we want to know what the devil don't know because if the devil knew what you know then he wouldn't be the devil okay but the devil is an adversary the Bible said the devil believe that there's one God but he trembles are you with me so often times people are going through certain problems certain conditions because they've been held captive in their minds and bondage in their minds they slaves in their minds something could happen to them in their childhood and they it they they build amen they build a a character surounding it becomes a stronghold in their life because they don't know how Amen to defeat uh uh get uh get rid of the pain get rid of the thing that happened to them in their childhood they don't know how to deal with it so they create amen a stronghold in their lives because amen they they don't know how to deal with the hurt and the pain that they go through so they relieve the pain over and over and over and over it's a recycle so they can't have perfect love because they only amen going through the hurt and pain and then sometimes they're able Amen to spread by talking amen h about the situation amen not that they got victory over it but they just constantly constantly talking about it it won't leave them alone neither will they leave it alone so it's a [Music] constantly I'm dealing with things that nobody knows about and nobody seems to understand what I'm dealing with I'm not going to tell anybody about it amen but it's deep down inside me and I can't get rid of the sting that keeps coming at me and I want to get victory over it we'll being H Le captain in our mind and with in bondage and we're slaves Amen to something that has happened to us in past tense and we become a victim in our minds we become the victim and we want everybody to see that I'm being victimized but it didn't start amen when you got 20 it didn't start when you got amen 30 it didn't start when you were 40 it started in your childhood and it just grew up till it became mature enough to you think amen that everybody's against you and you don't know why I can't s Amen to have the things that I think I deserve are the things that I think I want why can't I have what others have and why can't I have the things that I know I deserve why am I being why am I going through what I'm going through why do I have to be the one to suffer the things I suffer when others seem to make it all right and I'm suffering why am I suffering why am I a victim of circumstances why what can anybody feel my pain can any anybody understand my hurt but we got to go back as the prophet said he had to go back to where it started it and see we don't want to relive it but we relive it all the time but because it has taken on another form it became M mature is not in his infant state but it's in its mature state it doesn't look like the same thing but it is the same thing it just grew because we didn't know how to deal with it then neither do we know how to deal with it now so the EAS way of dealing with it we passing on to somebody else my problem problem is uh everybody else everybody seem to be against a family against me amen I'm the job people against me everywhere I go to church against me everybody's against me how can I deal with that seem like I ought to be encouraged somebody ought to come by and Pat me on shoulder and understand my pain and understand my hurt sometimes when I'm sister came up to me last night she saids brother Simmons after you ministered about going through it over and over and relieving our pain she said I was so full she said I look good on the out side but inside I've been going over and over the same thing she said thank you thank you thank you I don't have to carry this no more I appreciate it so dealing with that you know something the devil does not know or didn't know he might have find out by now but he tried it on Jesus and the things that he tried on Jesus how many know he'll try the same thing on you but you got to see what Jesus did when he was tempted and tried and you got to turn around and say Amen that I amen can do what Jesus did because I got the same tube I got the same weapon that he got if he can handle the devil so can I hopefully I get to knowing creating an atmosphere of perfect love I hope you're going to be able to see what you when you can see you can learn how to conduct your lives in a different way because sometimes we conduct our lives in a manner that we think that we're conducting our Our Lives properly but understanding what we're doing the principle of the law of faith and understanding that if I use this law of faith it works so by the grace of God in Matthew 16 13 I went a whole lot faster there and I went 30 minutes and I quit I told him to stay tuned for next week so by the grace of God y'all be be careful because I'll be to go 30 minutes and I'll be in the middle of it and y'all going to have to catch me next week too okay so he said here when Jesus came to the course of CIS Philippi he asked his disciples whom saying whom do men say that what I the son of man am and they said some say that thou who John the Baptist and Eli and and others or what but he said unto them but whom say what see uh See even the disciples wasn't certain so he said let me let me wait a minute wait a minute I'm walking with you and you were following me and all of that but who who you who do you think I am so you coming to church and you're here and you're faithful you pray and all that but who do you say D I said the devil didn't know the disciples seem to be puzzled telling them what some say they say this and they say that huh mama said that Daddy said that preacher said this and that church said that but let me get a little person who do you say I am the devil said if you be so all of them look like they were just astonished why you going to get personal with us because seemed like if anybody should have known him they should have known who he was if anybody ought to know who Jesus is y'all understand if anybody ought to know who Jesus is huh who ought to know huh come on brother Fred what you say you ought to know he said I ought to know y'all scared if anybody ought to know who ought to know that's all said we I'm going get this thing person but he said whom do what who do you who do you say I am amen the devil wouldn't show who he was but he said who do you who do ye say that I am you know the reason why we in such a a spiritual mess and we can't get up and praise the Lord and be happy CU we ain't certain reason why we can't get the victory in our lives because we are ain't certain they walked with him they did miracles signs and wonders seen all of it but he said who do men say I am then he said who do you say I am huh I said uh 2 + 2 is three Josiah 2 + 2 is three 2+ two you sure he said he positive how many agree with that y'all agree with him okay see what I'm saying when you show amen you got to be certain are you with me I just said it awake the children up they was with me the rest of the night down there okay so by the grace of God what happened here see except something happened in a supernatural realm they all would have been but they say this and they say that uhhuh we following him they one of them comes to Lord we found the Messiah you know what I'm saying and some dropped the necks and they left the ship and they followed him they left the tax elect they were fed him but it came the time amen even with all you left or you gave up still you're not able to discern enough to answer my question who do you say that I am going to church is not enough sing is not enough I said the devil didn't know and one thing about the devil been the heaven sang on The Choir in heaven was a leader was the assistant pastor in heaven are you with me but yet live for thousands of years know the scripture even tell and Jesus in the scripture are you with me but he didn't know and I'm saying do you know he said who do you say I am and Simon Peter answered and said what are you with me but H what happened here Jesus na said unto him blessed are thou Salon bana for flesh and what has not huh but who the only way you going to know is God has the what reveal it to you with that reel ation you'll never know he reveals himself to you by Revelation without Revelation you'll never know you just go to church that's why you can't be happy and smile and Lord you can't do it why you can only do what's in you the amount of Revelation you got that's the amount of praise you give that's why you can sit down in church and can't praise the Lord lack a revelation the more Revelation you get the more you worship him less Revelation he said all this I give you you get excited about the things of the world cuz because that's what he's giv you but for the price you got to bow down and what worship Him are you with me you can get excited about the ball game but you can't get excited about Jesus you get Happ and smile amen about a little money in the bank but you can't Happ and smile oh Lord about the goodness of the Lord amen this is what I want you to see before I close tonight I'm in the middle of it and I won't get too far see it has to be a revelation without a revelation you'll never be able to know now I'm I'm I'm gonna skip over a whole lot of things the the Matthew um excuse me Luke 23 Luke 23 and 33 Luke 23 and 33 are y'all with me y'all feel all right God is good y'all too quiet amen look at somebody asking do you know tell them the devil didn't know but do you know amen see what happens look what happened uh 23 and 33 it says you know Jesus here on Calvary being crucified right and he said and when they had were come to a place which is called what Calvary there they what crucified him he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ I'm telling you people going to church and they crucifying him again second time there they crucified him they killing them again because they don't don't know who he is they don't know they killing him crucifying the second time the prophet of God said I indite this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ so Moses smoked the right Rock twice okay let's we we're not going to get on that okay but by the grace of God I want you to see something simple he crucified him and the male Factor one on the right hand and the other on the what then said Jesus father what see forgive them because what I said the devil didn't know oh yeah he he know what he did yeah they know they know they know what they did to me yes they know yeah child they know I know they know somebody told brother simens and he was telling my business and he he told it over the P yet I know somebody told him brother erest told him you know had they didn't know he said forgive them I said that the devil didn't know what make you think and they didn't know and God said what we got to learn how to forgive one another because Christ what forgive us brother friend I'm getting to this perfect love Crea out feere perfect love if you can't forgive you can't have this kind of love Jesus was our example how he said forgive them [Music] because I'mma I'm going get a little closer be a little bit more straightforward with y'all get take y'all a little further than I took m in this in the scripture so by the grace of God the reason people hold on to their pain and their hurt because they don't forgive because they think people meant to do what they did to them they meant to do it I know they did it they're always doing something to me you you know that and we are got enough people to gather around us and Pat you on the back you Pat that little boy on the back doing all that bad stuff and Mama come to schoolbody messing with my child the teacher Tak advantage of him Mama sat down go home and pray spare the rod Spa the tow is't that right no discipline are you with me taking up for them when they're wrong cuz it's your baby that's my baby are you with me some folk be you ha to see him cry yeah they did you wrong baby they did you wrong baby no forgive them cuz what can you hold them uh chargeable for doing something that they didn't know what they were doing are you with me when I look little child amen do something that you know uh that they shouldn't have done as a child they did it and you say goodness you spank them and said don't do that no more the spanking wasn't to hurt them it was to help them because they did something that was going to hurt them worse are you with me so you didn't tap them you know I a talking about doing like some of you crazy come on some of them cursing I I seen those Mama come in the sto cursing a little child little child about three years old you're talking oh boy they cursing and going on I said Lord have mercy what in the world don't take all of that so the child grow up trying traumatized and you send them to school all traumatized mama don't cuss them out daddy don't cuss them out you know what I'm saying I told you to stop get to school and teacher talking nice see they used to somebody holling and screaming and yelling and cussing and all so somebody said nice um students we like they they traumatized they're all messed up are you with me so by the grace of God I I mean that y'all understand where I'm at so what what goes on he said forgive them because they don't understand what they're doing but we can't have perfect love till we get the mindset of the one that God is what love amen God is love isn't that right and if you got God you got love are you with me the Holy Ghost is the love of God shed abroad in our hearts are you with me so what happens is that we got to learn that when somebody uh you know when something happens we got to learn how to deal with forgiving instead of in I'm I'mma get them I'mma tell everybody what they' done to me let everybody know that they did it to me I'mma get them back I remember and 19 come on somebody it's 2000 and something now but I got it I got it all in my memory bank are you with me some you got to let it go the folks dead and gone and you still holding on to it are you with me but they did me like that see you Carrying Your Pain still you still carrying your hurt and your pain because you letting it live on live on and it's going and you're passing it down the line somebody instead of saying give it up forgive and understand they wouldn't have done it if they knew what they were doing if they didn't know what they were doing why you holding against them they know what they were doing the devil didn't know they didn't know you think Jesus telling a lie huh what did he say read it again what did he say is he lying somebody lying in here you better go straight out all those lies you told on somebody brother brandom said people said the devil made me do it and they brother BR said the devil didn't make they do it they did it because they wanted to do it it was down desire that's why they did it you talking about the devil made me do it and Calvin said they said on the steps cry the devil said on steps outside crying so the people in the church lying on him and Prophet say the same thing he ain't said it like he said it but but by the grace of God y'all better stop and come on be real come on and see that God is requiring us to have perfect love but you'll never get it until you'll be willing to get rid of all those bad situations that you've been holding on to all your life but the Bible said whom the sun set free is what but you can't be free when you've been captive in your mind are you with me I got into some areas that I won't get into right here down the m see because but let me let me go one more um first excuse me the devil First Corinthians 2 chapter and then I'll just probably close the night I I probably almost went over my time and a verse I believe it is but let me let me see seventh verse second First Corinthians 2 chapter 7th verse everybody all right the devil didn't know but you still scared to shake hand with somebody scared to look him in the face cuz they done done you wrong I want nothing to do with them they better not said nothing to me I wonder if Jesus would have done us like that I'll slap him I'll slap him down you got some mean Christians in it they just be like Jesus I to be like so and L so holy just to be like him you want to be like him oh come on somebody I know y'all quiet in there y'all all right y'all didn't go to sleep on me okay he said here but we speak the wisdom of God in a what mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before what the world into his glory uh the world ordained before unto our Glory excuse me un our glory amen to our Glory right which what I said the devil didn't know said none of them knew not if the devil would have known see a lot of things you think the devil know but the devil don't know he ain't certain that's why you got to have a revelation for yourself do you know that Jesus died for your sin I said do you you you do you really know that you certain do you know if you accept him that your sins will be forgiven somebody say why should I accept it I hold on to my sins cuz I ain't certain I ain't certain that God is good are you with me God may be good but I ain't certain he's good enough for me that I can serve him if God was so good then I ain't certain he's that good the Bible said oh taste and see that the Lord he's good I don't know I want to get out there cuz the devil tell me those people out there having a good time oh yes I see them I want to get out there and have me a little good time too I I don't want to be bored come to church and be all bored up people can't praise the Lord don't want down on the feet and Shout but they be dancing in the club I want some of that it'll cost you it'll cost you you got to bow down and what you got to worship him that's what you want to do that's why you don't want to serve the Lord I ain't so I ain't sure the devil said if you be are you still iing I I don't know what I want to be baptized and and live for the Lord I don't know whether I want to stay in church because the reason why because I just don't know and somebody else didn't know who that you didn't know huh who what the devil didn't know and who side you on come on somebody are you on the devil's side do you know that Jesus died for your sin do you know that he love you you certain do you love him oh do you want to serve him I didn't hear everybody don't people got their mouth closed they scared to see it cuz the devil listening if I said I might end up have to do it you see what I'm saying you see what I'm saying but I want to make it real to you if it don't become real to you you you you you s around and the devil will beat you up two ways two Edge forward come back with and forward are you with me me it cut right it ain't going to miss me are you with me so don't don't worry just try to get what's for you amen God I want to see me in the mirror I want to look at me in my condition I want help I don't want to be a victim but I don't want to be a victim but I want to be V have victory in my life I want to have Victory I want to walk in Victory I want to walk with my head out and say God I thank you God I praise you God I love you want to walk in Victory okay he said here none of the princes of the world knew had they were they wouldn't what the Bible say baam tried to curse the people and he turned around he was what are you with me blessed when men should persecute you where your blessings come from when men should persecute you speak all my what falsely right what do you say you know what it said now y'all know what it say now cuz what come on they know what they was doing I I didn't say that I ain't going say
