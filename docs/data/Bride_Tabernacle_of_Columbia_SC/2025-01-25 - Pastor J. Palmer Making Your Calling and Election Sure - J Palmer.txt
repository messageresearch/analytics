amen for giving us a little space tonight just to share a little something with you and just to try to encourage you in the name of the Lord amen amen second [Music] Peter first chapter just one verse there and then we want to go to the Book of Revelation 1 and3 wherefore the rather brethren give all diligence to make your calling and your election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall Book of Revelation 13 and we'll come back to Peter and it reads blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand let us pray father we thank you for your word in Jesus name amen may be SE seated I want to go back to First Peter 2 just want to try to encourage you tonight amen thank God Amen we made it through another year amen by God's grace and but we all know that it's going to take more pressing now than ever before amen I want to title this just for a few minutes making your calling and your election sure and as I was thinking about the things that each and every one of us do from day to day not so much in the natural sense but that's okay to but I'm talking about the spiritual things seeing that we are the people of God that is seeing the closing of the hours seeing modern events made clear by prophecy seeing the warning sign the Judgment signs everything seemed to be pointing toward it's over and sometimes I wonder as Christians especially for those of us that have heard what God is doing in this hour and what God has already spoken that will take place I believe it ought to make us pinch ourselves and wake up that it's a serious time we don't know it could be over in the morning some of us had asked ourself what am I doing how is my Christian walk with God I'm talking about each individual now I'm was telling the church man there's no need for us looking around at the neighbor or the church down the road or dis know let's look at each and personally our own selves the Bible say examine your own self right so every one of us need a spiritual examination you need to know where you stand you need to know if God called you to the Salvation of the Gospel then that it comes with a sacrifice I was telling one brother I said I just don't believe that we have the time to be wondering around doing this and doing that we got to be sure not what we doing brother s time pass we did this and this and this and Tred to do this and this but now we want to be have some type of vision or uh inspiration what we are doing and why we are not looking for great [Music] members we're looking for God elect amen God chosen his seed and if you notice it's a very real thing now to see people come to the Gospel of Jesus Christ we don't see very many that come to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior we're gleaning the fields one here and one there but for those of us who have heard that voice of God and you know that it was God that called you and I never want to overemphasize that because it has to be something direct true amen I can't live on what somebody tell me though that might be okay but I got to hear God's voice for myself amen even the young people even the children there has to be something that is drawing you am not your sisters not your aunties or your brothers it has to be something that is drawing you to get yourself right with God and brother fed said get right get right get right with God and do it when yes right now we have no time to wait you have no time to look to 20 years and and this happened and that happened because it could be over in just a twinkling of an eye for some of us well we at any time pieace of God everything is pointing to a nuclear bomb California and different places having earthquakes the fires disasters everything seem to be getting worse and worse but I believe that our Christian Life ought to be getting a little more sincere true amen your walk with God ought to be ought to mean more to you even than your career amen your career can only help you here on this Earth and not with that that don't even last but we don't know what to expect what's coming but one thing we know that is coming God is coming amen you're not going to have time to get the Holy Ghost later get it now amen if nobody else don't want it you seek God for it amen and if you got it you're going to need more am amen we can never have enough I believe what we need we need a refilling amen amen we need another touch from God in our lives am we need something as the Church of God that's going to set our souls on fire again amen what we need I've been thinking about I said we we need a re a a spiritual Reviving amen amen something to connect us back to God that we won't be looking around for God over here and over there you will know he's within you amen a lot of was I was the H I was telling them down there I said we we always I was that Brother Anderson last week I believe and I was saying that you know we we be waiting for minister to come abroad to speak certain things to us but you shouldn't have to have that cuz God has spoken to us in these days the The searchable Riches of Christ he have uh let us know what we are up against he let us know that a 200,000 demons have been let loose out of the river Euphrates to come against us you're going to need a prayer life I'm not talking about these five minutes and 10 minutes you going to need to spend some time with God all of we need to spend more time amen prayer ought to become breakast there used to be a time brother SED door stayed open for prayer now it's hard to get the people to come to those things but that was really the very Foundation of where we at today I heard the servant of God said he said the very Secrets behind the opening of the seals he said it because of prayer what's the secret be behind our life being illuminated with God is prayer you can study you can remember you can recite and all that's all right but without a prayer life without a communication that shows so begin to just pour out on the altar of God until God come and do something am amen and I ain't just talking about a thrill or a little uh a chill bump but I'm talking about some fire amen amen the way we can die to our own self daily amen that nothing else matters more to you but getting a hold of God amen amen the time that we don't spend anymore listening and reading our Bibles and consecrating our lives getting spiritual breakthrough because of these conditions that we got going on in our body in our homes in our churches Lord help us to get back to the old Landmark let me just read something I looked up something and and it said that making a calling in your election sure he said it means to confirm that God has called and chosen you and this the part I like and to live in a way that reflects that see to live in a way that reflects your calling and your election we we are not just church gos that's why we not part of denomination because God has called us to a higher calling than just coming to church amen amen there has been too long of a program with the whole church CH World they know how to go to church but they don't get in contact with God and then when they do get in contact with God we allow the devil to come in and steal the joy of our Salvation oh I I'm understanding little by little perfect God say how that we ought to be the most happiest people on the face of the Earth why because when you have a full understanding what Calvary and what he did for you amen as an individual as those sister say it'll make you shout amen but it becomes personal that he died for me and me alone amen and he chose you above everybody else not that you were better not what you were something speci but it was God before the foundation of the world had already amen chosen you amen that's why you could come to the word cuz you already a part of him though we didn't know it it but then that great connection came God came and found us where were we didn't went looking for him I just care how to get away from how God will go to the lowest the lowest to get one of his amen thank you Jesus there are no boundaries thank you Lord there are no limits no place where God won't go to get his elect amen amen a lot of people like the say they're talking to people and witness to them you know they have this consultion and you probably heard it too that I come to God when I get ready not so and let Le God have called you for it that's true amen and be yes Bible say yeah many are called but only a few are chosen the gospel of Salvation is for all amen but God already know who is going to accept that but being just he has to make it for everybody Amen to give you an opportunity so you want to say well God didn't give me a a chance oh no nobody won't have that excuse though we may have turned it down and God so tell had to wa to the extrem to do things just to get our attention amen amen oh he did it for me amen I don't know what he did for you but he went to the ex scream sing the song sometime I don't know why amen Jesus loves me I don't know why he even cares amen oh but I'm so glad that he could have left us where we were I thank God he didn't leave me Lord knows I thank God it it was very scary out there Darkness sinful thing that were going on and I'm right in the middle of it don't even know why I'm even out here a lot of time people be that way they be out there in a dark cosos position and don't even know why they out there they just out there because I'm just hanging out but you're in darkness and God said come out of that amen amen and God this hour he said he sent a little light in this hour just a little space of light to get us out of this thing amen and he's doing everything to pull you oh some of us he have to drive us but I thank God the Bible say he won't lose one amen oh it doesn't matter how you have to do it he will not lose amen not one amen that's why young people and old people whatever age there is it doesn't matter serve God in your youth amen amen young people serve him in a young age amen you're not going to miss anything all you missing out there is death am that's all this world give you death in the pot amen the worldly pleasure the world desires the Hollywood look like the grammar and all of famous come on that's a mirage amen Hollywood looking so looking so good it's like tasting a a a Whopper they're looking So Glamorous and you never see the bad thing that goes on to you amen amen you see the cars and the Styles and the luxury you know and the fame of everybody you know being on the top oh if you could just visit them maybe for a week or so and see what all they got to go through amen amen you'll be glad to come to church it won't be just a boring place to you it'll be a place that it's my refuge amen amen amen living a Christian Life and I used to always think it even when I was a little boy because of growing up in church so and going to church so is like Lord have mercy how much church is enough now I'm seeing it ain't enough we ain't even coming to church enough I believe the B say we ought to assemble ourselves the more right as we see what they approaching this day right here we almost need to be in church every day praying and calling on God and getting a refilling of the Holy Ghost a a rededication am oh I can just feel that sometimes that if we could just humble ourself down and and settle into God because let me tell you something at the end of it you going to see none of this thing on this Earth matters amen amen I never forget I'm I'm doing something that a mar brother Sim used to have those nights of prayer whoever need to go home let them go home we need something from God we don't need singing like we think we need God singing is all right but it going to take a life for us to live and only we going to get that we going to have to get back down here but can't be something we we kind of push to people it ought to be a desire amen it ought to be a desire that we want the people to get in contact with God amen amen not the preacher and not the church but we want you to get in Conta with a personalized experience with Jesus Christ amen the where he can empty you out and fill you up amen amen amen CU without that the devil will walk us down amen I'm telling you he walking us down because we don't have a desire Lord I Want More amen I want more than last year and brother through we just don't want sermons preached we want something that going to break yolks we want something that's going to bring the people to this altar without even having an altar call amen CU I believe the Holy Ghost got that kind of joy and power am if we can ever get in tune to the spirit of God it'll draw us back to that y'all know we used to those times nobody had to call the Holy Ghost begin to call amen and that's what we need we need the Holy Ghost back in our churches again we need that fresh anointing amen ministers first need to get in contact amen we must get illuminated amen cuz we must be the one that set the examples that's true true amen we must be be the one to know how to be able to move into the spirit of the real of God to draw the people there cuz we don't draw the people to the pr go we be drain them to ourselves and all that going to do is fail you're not going to be able to hold a preacher coats you're not going to be able to live off his experience we won't want you to have your own amen tell them brother I said brother as ministers we really too [Music] loose we really too loose we don't spend the time we don't make the sacrifices that we need to do cuz we gotten so busy running after this and running after I'm tell I believe that I told said listen if you know God call you for something what are you doing doing all this other [Music] stuff I learned that if I believe God called me with something I want to this I want to stay single Focus I got to I can't go with this and this every time somebody hey come here hey no no no no no no no it's okay if the God lead you sometimes but what has God called you for amen and every world has got to find out what has God called you for cuz God didn't call nothings God don't have nothings on his body every part of your body has a particular function amen amen and if if one part of it don't work right it will affect the whole body amen amen so is it in the spiritual realm God spiritually body must learn to remain in their calling and work in harmony true amen we don't have time for schisms and jealousy and all this crazy stuff come on jealous or what it's one body amen your church and this church and no no even about your buildings it's about Christ am amen by one Spirit we are baptized into one body amen and I tell them back home sometime I say you know a lot of time we have some narrow-minded people that think that they church is the only church that got it you deceive yourself no I don't I know that every man has to minister to the ability that God gives him but no matter how little someone feel you going to need that little pinky that little small toe in your body it don't seem like it it it uh do much but you need that and we're going to find we need your we need one another amen and all of us if we can learn to work in harmony if that's what God called this one for thank God I got to find out what he called me for amen amen and that body begin to work like this whatever division is whatever part you play and then you play the part amen amen and stop trying to take somebody else Place amen you got a place you got to go pray up and find out what is my place Lord amen and let me abide in my place amen amen man our cars we drive if we knew all the parts that was connecting that thing together and everything under that got a part to play to make everything run properly and that's why they had do recalls a lot of time cuz there's a part under there that don't fit and it caused a default and so they have to call it back and straighten that out amen they might had hurry and put something together because it might would work and it work for a season but then they find out oh this is causing some computer problems with the rest of the car so we got the so they oh we can do this with it if we change this so they begin to call those cars back and they they begin to redesign and reprogram what they have done is sometime we got to come back to where we got off at amen and find out what is the problem amen why am I not growing in Christ let me tell you if you a Christian and you not growing in Christ there something wrong amen some kind of spirit didn't came in and it got one of your parts something in your life done got off that's why I said it's time for us to get a checkup Lord search my heart search my Reigns Lord yes Lord search me inside out a lot of things we know what it is a lot of time we all we as humans you know we human and we like to think that somebody else causing it no no you causing it all of us have things that we have to deal with in this life amen and God allowed it for all of us to have your own little issues and you have to work out your salvation with fear and trembling you have to understand said lay aside every weight of sin something we carrying around that we don't need to be carrying around let it go we holding on to things that is not doing nothing but are hindering amen and you know what it is the cares of this life the cares of this world it will choke the very life of God out of you true amen don't you think you can work like a slave horse and be spiritually minded too it'll drain you amen F it'll suck your prayer life amen and when that prayer life get sucked then you start getting dry when you start getting dry then you start staying away from the house of God when you start staying from the house of God then the devil let you make more money see he got to substitute that thing are you'll catch on too quick but if he give you more money you'll feel happy oh I'm making it don't let money trick you amen it best to stay with God and make less money amen if it going to cause you to go away from God Amen hard sometimes to had one sister after we had a new year right before New Year's and I was ministering on something and I was saying something you know that's how the devil going to tempt somebody you know with a a certain job and it's going to draw them away from the house of God the next day the sister with the work and they' offer her a position making $90,000 a year but you won't be able to go to church and she said I didn't even hesitate she said cuz I remembered what was said when the Lord spoke and the GU say you going to turn this job down yes then he came back again that's all the devil do say he you a going to accept that first know she begin to get Temptation on you see but she said I told you on yesterday I am not going to take the position yes you can do a lot of thing with it can you but the end of the matter amen he never tell us the end and that's how he get us [Music] he lure Us in with things that we can really use too who can use more money yes you can think of the things you might be can do with it but you won't be able to be in the house of the Lord you won't be able to go to the house of God and hear the word like you used to and I know it may not people not don't think well any a big thing if I don't come to church let me tell you don't let the devil fool you well I can listen to the live stream I can catch up it won't be the same and nothing like being in the presence of God when that fire fall I don't like to miss things myself if a door is open I can get there I want to be there yeah cuz that might be just the night God had a word just for you amen because of what you've been going through and then you stay home or you allow the devil to move you and that move could cost you CU When that devil come in on you he coming full y'all know try to know nowadays the devil is not coming lightly he know he got to work harder and what he's coming now he coming with everything he got young as well is old he don't care how young you are all he want is I've got to get him now because it's later then I than they think amen we don't have no bunch of time I'm here what you don't get here don't worry about it

of Rich folks had millions and millions of dollar homes and all lost everything all the precious this and precious that you lose everything can't replace certain things things that you value things that really means a lot to you this is my precious uh centerpiece this is my precious this and precious that maybe you had a nice Rose rods in the car garage that you couldn't pull out you know but think about it think about it all of that stuff they had to leave there and they had to run for their life everything that they had worked so hard and they said uh most of the middle class people got no means in ever rebuilding so the middle class maybe the middle class probably make half a million out there maybe close to a million that's middle class in California there half a million a year to
