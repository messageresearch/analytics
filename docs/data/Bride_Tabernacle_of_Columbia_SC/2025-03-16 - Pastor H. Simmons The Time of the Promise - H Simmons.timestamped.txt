[32:00] chapter in the 17th verse Acts 7 and

[32:12] amen
[32:15] hallelujah but when the time of the
[32:18] promise Drew
[32:21] nigh which God had swor to Abraham
[32:27] the people grew and multiplied in
[32:31] Egypt till another king arose which knew
[32:36] not
[32:39] Joseph the same dealt subtly with our
[32:45] Kindred and Evena entreated our
[32:49] father so that they cast out their young
[32:54] children to the end they might not live
[32:59] live in which time Moses was born and
[33:04] was exceeding fair and nourish up in his
[33:08] father's house three
[33:11] months and when he was cast
[33:16] out Pharaoh's daughter took him up and
[33:20] nourished him for her own
[33:23] son and Moses would learn in all the
[33:26] wisdom of the Egyptian and was mighty in
[33:31] word and in
[33:33] deed and when he was full 40 years
[33:39] old it came into his heart to visit his
[33:43] Brethren the children of
[33:46] Israel and seeing one of them suffered
[33:50] wrong he defended him and Avenged him
[33:55] that was oppressed
[33:58] and smoke the
[33:59] Egyptian for he supposed his Brethren
[34:03] would have
[34:05] understood how that
[34:07] they how that God by his hand would what
[34:12] Del them but they what understood not
[34:16] and the next day he showed himself unto
[34:19] them as they
[34:22] stro and would have set them at one
[34:28] against
[34:30] saying
[34:32] sir ye are
[34:34] what why do you wrong one to
[34:38] another but he that did his neighbor
[34:43] wrong thrust him away saying who made
[34:47] thee a What ruler and a judge over us
[34:51] will thou kill me as thou did the what
[34:55] Egyptian yesterday and then fled Moses
[34:59] at this sand and was a stranger in the
[35:04] land of
[35:06] Midian where he what he got two sons and
[35:11] when he was and when 40 years were
[35:16] expired there appeared unto him in the
[35:19] wilderness of Si and what
[35:24] angel
[35:26] in and when Moses saw it he wondered at
[35:30] the sight and as he drew near to behold
