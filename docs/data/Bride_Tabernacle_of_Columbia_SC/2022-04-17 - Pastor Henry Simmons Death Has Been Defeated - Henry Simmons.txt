word now lord and bless everyone that pressed away heal save and deliver in jesus name we pray amen amen as we continue to stand we're gonna read in romans the sixth chapter and uh i'll read the first you read the next and we'll go down to the 10th verse and we'll just cut it short we read the 10th verse together amen we talked this morning about amen death hasn't known them praise god power amen death has been defeated are you with me i said this is we call it easter the resurrection morning and testifies that death has been defeated romans 6 and 1 and uh and you read the next and we read the tenth together what shall we say then shall we continue and sin that grace may abound too know you're not that so many of us as we're baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death for for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection six for he that is dead is freed from sin 8. knowing this that christ being raised from the dead died no more death has no more dominion over him together for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god god bless the rings word you may be seated death has been defeated praise god amen if we talked about easter sunday morning and talk about the resurrection when the women came to the gravesite marion they went to see the body of jesus and what they saw they saw the stone was rolled away praise god are y'all with me this morning you you know sometimes i i i was just finished another other day in louisville kentucky on friday and uh by the grace of god and you know it's probably a little bit more people have hit there than it is here uh might be about the same you know because the churches but anyway i was telling them concerning the quicken power praise god we used to they used to have a storefront church and uh we would go there and you know many miracles and signs and oneness were done in that place and every time i go look like god would work miracles you know and i i went after about 10 years or more and god came down in such a supernatural way the presence of god just rested in the place and they asked me to preach a revival and i said oh i i held off and um somehow we went and preached a couple of services but on friday night something happened i believe special god just came down and you know folks got to shouting and dancing in the spirit and we stayed around as the holy ghost moved for a while amen i'm talking about most of them was white people now y'all black people uh am i color blind are you with me and if they can shout and praise the lord are y'all with me but i you know we we brought a message on the quicken power and uh by the grace of god by the time of the end i believe the power the quickened power came amen are you with me and i believe that same quickness power is here amen praise god and he wants to quicken us amen god wants to do something for us i said on the other day god is no more than what he was yesterday god you we cannot make god any more than he more god than he is we cannot make god any less god god is what he was he is right now what he was he is right now amen amen amen what the bible talked about a god of and most people look at that god that was but he is god now he said he meant to them that were a question he said that i am that i am oh you look me they were talking about the god of abraham and the god of eyes and in the god of jacob he said abraham desire to see my day and and he was glad they said this man ain't 50 years old how come he talked about abraham desire to see him he said before abraham was i am praise god i hope that we are serving i am god a present tense god that he's the same god that was yesterday he's the same god today and forever praise god and he's the same god and that same god will react like he had yesterday he acted that way today and what he did for those people he'll do for you praise god you he's the same god amen all we got to do is believe that he is amen he's a rewarder of them that dylan just seek him praise god god i do for you oh what does the resurrection what does the resurrection mean to you just what is it is it was it any value to you did it have any purpose or significant amen to you what does the resurrection mean to you amen as an individual how does it affect amen my purpose in my life what does the resurrection mean to me amen it's an individual thing yet you know some for some they don't take advantage amen of what the resurrection means amen you will not take advantage of this if you didn't know amen praise god what it means and what it meant amen but it's up to you and i to recognize that there is an advantage amen in the resurrection it proves that death has been i said death has been take somebody out of hand and say do you believe it death has been defeated praise god death has been defeated romans 8 said if the spirit that ray 8 11 said if the spirit to raise jesus from the dead if it dwells in you it should also or you will be if it's in you it's going to what it's going to quick and something going to happen praise god something got to happen because if it's the spirit that raised jesus from the dead how many you uh uh uh have received the holy ghost holy ghost without quickening power is what are you with me see it it's not to confess but to possess holy ghost without quoting power is this a words of intelligence and amen words that we think that we got but we need quitting power you know i i i was sharing in uh louisville concerning amen uh uh the the wise and the foolish virgins and and they said that uh amen the bride don't come and go here to meet him and we find that the foolish virgins they ran out of all are you with me they didn't say they didn't have spirit it's a type of the holy holy ghost amen but they ran out of oil and when they ran out they said to those that had it give us of your all right and it said not so amen you had to go and buy for yourself it's an individual journey i can't give you amen mine you got to get your own are you with me you might see amen me stirred up and fired up but i can't give you none of mine you got to get your own fire the reason why they they recognized they meant something about them they said uh for our lamps or what our lamps are going out have you ever seen amen folk come to church amen but the lamp's going out folk come to church amen and there's no fire no praise god folks serve god what caused your lamps to go out amen we went back in exodus and in leviticus and and we find that the lamps of god in the tabernacle of god the bible said they ought to burn always and then on leviticus they said it's you should never let it go out it should burn continuously amen it's got to burn all the time don't never let the lamps of god go out but we find in the days of samuel and eli amen in first samuel 3 amen that uh the the lamps before the ark of the covenant the lambs went out amen and god called samuel in a time when amen the priests supposed to make sure that the lamps never go out but the amen are going out amen in the temple oh you would be brother and sister in the temple where it should burn continuously and make the latter going out praise god to find out amen praise god folks in the amen in the temple amen where the light shall shine always what jesus said i never leave you i never forsake you but i'll be with you always amen god said i never i i won't forsake what happened to the life sometimes you look at christians and you wonder what happened to their joy praise god what happened to your peace amen what happened what happened in your life that caused your life to go out praise god maybe the all leaked out but what happened brother what happened sister some folks are backslidden they met because the lights went out some folks on life got like they used to the labs are going out you know continuously the bible said men ought to always pray are you what man amen and uh the reason why amen we don't have the fire no more because we're not always friends the bible said in all things we ought to give them amen we we we find ourselves in situations and things go on in our lives and we don't thank the lord no more praise god instead of thanking him we complain about this and complain about that the bible said in all things thankful reason why i'm gonna thank him because all things will work together to the good to them to love the lord have you fallen out of love with god or do you still love him then in spite of amen i said death has been defeated the resurrection means something to me it means that death has been defeated it means that sin has been defeated the bible says in romans 6 sin shall not have are you with me i said sin should not have dominion over me no more hey god i got something better praise god i got something better amen i don't need to be a center here the bible said the way that the sin is there are you with me praise god why this shadow amen why should i live dead [Music] the bible said you that were dead and trust me in his sin has he quit convoy made a lie praise god who the one how you like being dead praise god hallelujah nobody wants to die amen but i said before the resurrection something took place before the resurrection amen i heard when they sing on calvary amen i said it took a calvary took a cross they met jesus went to calvary brother god i said jesus went to calvary oh hallelujah we can rejoice this morning because of the resurrection but jesus went to calvary yes somebody said he paid it all jesus went to calvary oh god he paid it all hallelujah aren't you glad that he paid it all somebody not praising the lord because they meant they don't know no better remember you didn't know better you know that jesus paid it all amen i'm glad he paid a debt hallelujah i'm glad he paid the penalty amen when i should have died he died in my place he paid it all praise god is it is it nice me in the center you love being a sinner and is it that's it's so sweet so nice sin is so lovely this is like people falling in love with a serpent and they're kissing him sin is so nice oh i just love you that ugly are you with me hugging a serpent sin seem to be so pleasant you know it's calling how your eyes is you know your eyes can be so blind until you can love sin amen and people you know some focus i'm a christian but i still dibble and dab amen i don't believe you know what you're dibbling diving in amen that ugly creature oh god uh let me let me uh go to first corinthians 15 and 20. first going to 15. i first corinthians 15. so by the grace of god it's something about falling in love with sin amen now if you didn't want me to preach on sin you came to the wrong place because i hate sin amen i don't like sin and i don't love the devil so if you're in love with the devil you in the wrong place are you with me praise god and who do you know who the biggest devil is is not your brother not your sister not somebody else but yourself the bible said men would be lovers of themselves and we were doing a series for the last couple of months on humbling yourself amen until you can get humble enough to see yourself as a sinner praise god you'll never be saved praise god but you love yourself that and i call it the luciferian doctrine the devil said i will ascend above the stars of god and i would exalt my throne the devil he meant talking about what's here above the stars of god and and i would be like the most high they met the attitude the bible said in the last days they were headed high-minded lovers the pledges more than lovers of god amen men would love themselves god god thank god i'm not killed to love on yourself i'm here to let your set be crucified are you with me if you don't want to die you in the wrong place praise god because you got to die before you can be resurrected amen i thought it took the death amen we talk about resurrection mourning what it believe means to me praise god what does it mean praise god that this old flesh that you even want me to sympathize with you praise god i don't like it in me this thing is my enemy praise god amen i got to amen kill the soul flesh amen praise god you put up with that old stink the bible says sin stinks in the nostrils of god are you up man you put up with the devil and amen and folk that and leave him alone yeah leave him alone to god to save him about the why like telling my mama mama mama little yeah momma said uh son i don't mean no home but i got to tell her oh you're with me and i said well you know we she said uh i got to tell them when it comes down you gonna know the truth and the truth gonna set you free and the truth is in my flesh that is in me and my flesh dwelleth what no good thing so what what what you're trying to convince yourself that you got something good you holding on to you ain't holding on to nothing good cause in me that is in my flesh twilight no good thing i need oh lord oh oh god somebody ought to taste and see that the lord he's good come on somebody hallelujah i i said eve she tasted amen she tasted of the unknown she tasted uh what the serpent said i'm going to give you something you don't know nothing about are you with me and because she saw that the dream you know pleasant to the eyes and wanting to make one wise she did eat some of y'all been eating up that same tree are you a man praise god but she did not know amen because she was deceived by the devil she didn't notice she was every sickness every hospital amen every death every pain every soul is a result for her being deceived by the devil praise god if you die and go to hell i'm gonna dress it up if you die and go to hell and that won't it won't be because as bishop wrote they said i didn't tell you are you with me you die and go to hell it's going to be your fault nobody fought but mine i said ain't nobody fault but yours it's up to you what are you going to obey god or not you love the devil then you you deserve to be where the devil is i don't want you to be there now but that's what you want you made your own decision your own choice that you love the devil more than you love god you made your own decision that was your decision amen god decision whosoever will let him come take up the water of life freely amen god loves you enough but the thing come to kill the steel and what to destroy the devil his purpose but i said what i said uh death has been destroyed praise god but you just don't know amen that the wages of sin is death and when death has been destroyed sin has been destroyed sin shall not have any dominion over you because sin has been the debt of sin has been paid for jesus already paid the debt for your sin praise god hallelujah glory to god you know i i i i just oh lord help me help me jesus i need help now uh first corinthians 15 20 it said but now is christ risen from the dead amen are you with me i said he arose in a windstorm he arose god has a risen as he said the angel said he's not here he's not dead he's alive oh you look man i'm saying he he's alive now praise god we were dead and trespassing our sins doing all kind of things drinking smoking lying stealing homework and all of that but he's alive take some out of hand tell him he's alive praise god why do you mean why why why still live like you're dead why why you want to die when he's alive praise god hallelujah hey god how do you do y'all he came to set the captain free praise god that's what he came to do psychic captain free the devil that got a hole on your life he come to shut the captain free praise god he did it for me and he'll do it for you praise god i said he did it for me he'll do the same thing for you praise god because you got to want to be free amen praise god it says lies christ rhythm from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for since by man came what death man disobeyed god and he died are you willfully disobeying god are you one of those disobedient children some folk will bold and brave so i ain't scared of nothing but one day you're gonna be scared to go in that fire [Music] and some folk think they're going to escape and god don't feel sorry for them and let them in if we let you in you're gonna act like the devil over there because you got that same kind of attitude and heaven won't be heaven with you over there are you with me because you don't you wouldn't love god when you if you went to heaven you still wouldn't love god you think you if you don't love god while you're living when you die and rise again you think you're going to start loving god then no you'll still be the same one the change got to be made on this side you got to love him now you ain't gonna oh oh lord how much of me a sinner oh i love you now lord uh-uh you got to have that nature change right now you got to let jesus come into your life now why the blood running warm in your vein just like the rich man woke up in hell and lifted up his eyes and he said send ladders that he can go tell my brother don't come in where i am it's too late then brother and sister it's too late then praise god i'm gonna tell you some all the tricks and all the schemes that you think you got praise god you'll never deceive god you never i scheme and i'll trick god god knows the end from him again he knows what you're talking about and all the little stuff you do praise god you're trying to fool yourself you ain't fooling god praise god you're trying to play games with god and think i i i and then you find yourself in hell i thought the devil so deceived people to the he always put off god to tomorrow and the bible tells you tomorrow ain't promised to you isn't that right but you always want god i said tomorrow okay i got i got i want to be sure but y'all know how it is you know we got only got this one opportunity i'm gonna tell you something i was telling brother nathan something took place in the office and it flashed before me it it could be somebody here last opportunity i go through those little flash it's some type of flashback i go through and i said lord and i told him i said jennifer those are gonna be late i said if i'm right in my spirit they're gonna be a little late and somebody said well uh i see the daughters they're already here i said well jennifer though gonna be late and i told him in office i said well what i'm seeing then i know that somebody here may have the last opportunity so i got to be serious with what i'm preaching y'all might not understand but it may be somebody last time are you with me amen you can walk out of that though and don't give jesus christ your life and don't know where tomorrow go with tomorrows now everybody listening to me but everybody can't hear me because the majority of their people gonna walk out here just like they walked in they heard the same thing you heard but some people didn't hear me but there'll be somebody that we're here and i want that one that god has ordained to hear to heal the word of the lord because i know so it's going to be a lot of people miss but there's somebody here i believe god is talking to and they hear the word but the majority i'm going to tell you yeah they said for real i'ma tell you for real the majority of you gonna walk out here the same it might be just one person in here that can hear are you with me so i hope that one that god should listen to me i'm not talking about me preaching to you because it's far beyond that i'm talking about the voice of god that's inside of you telling you what to do i'm talking about you i'm not talking about the man in the pulpit i'm talking about the man inside you the voice that's speaking inside of you as an individual you know you hear a voice sometimes that voice tell you uh-uh not now and sometimes that voice will tell you yes lord i hear you you know what i'm saying and that's see because the preacher can preach but until god speaks to you are you with me it's just something he's saying yeah a lot nice message good good but you're going on about your business but when that voice in you some of y'all know what i'm talking about that's what happened when you god say it was something about divorce in you the preacher was in the pulpit but it was divorce in me that made the difference i realized the voice was speaking inside of me telling me to come home amen and when that voice spoke inside of me i could not deny it i would write it in because i know it was something i wanted to do praise god not something my mama wanted me to do other folk wanted me to do but something i wanted to do i wanted i wanted jesus then it became personal it says by man came also the resurrection of the dead i gotta it says for as in adam all what first adam you were born in sin shaping it in you come to the world speaking life nothing you had to do with it you were center bone born a sinner you didn't do nothing to do it well why did god let me be born that way no i couldn't help myself praise god sometimes people are born politically with rich sometimes people born rich which they was pope sometimes pokemon black wish they were white sometimes white wish they would black are you with me i ain't get into something y'all know what it's all about are you with me but what god made you said thank you jesus you had a reason for making me what you mean are you well we were born in sin but god thank god but man came deaf a man also came to what resurrection from the dead now god just you know you didn't have nothing to do with you being in sin and you couldn't get yourself out of it are you with me and adam all die but then christ should all be made a while alive jesus got you out of it but which one would you rather be still dead or will you want to be alive that's your decision some folk just plain old happy being dead you can't get them from being dead because they we're going to stay dead are you with me i don't care ah i haven't told them you can preach your head off they gonna stay dead why but he that has an ear to heal let him hear with the spirit some folk i can get into that maybe it's a little too heavy but some folk just no matter if god himself just come down and the angels come down with wings some folks still wouldn't believe they still would say i want to go to hell because i love what i'm doing i'm just having such a wonderful time until i wouldn't give it up if an angel came from heaven you know that's attitude they love it you know doctor said stop eating fried chicken you live you love dried chicken god i'm sorry my sister amen but you know i should say something else [Laughter] but it's some you know it's something we got to deny are you with me if god tells you to give it up you got to be willing to give it up if you want to live the doctor tell you you can't do this no more if you do this some more you know your sugar gonna get high and you're gonna die you know what some folks change their eating habits because they wonder what live i'm telling you you going to hell if you don't stop doing what you're doing this is dr jesus talking to you amen and the prescription for your life is if you do it you going straight are you with me if you don't stop you got opportunity to turn from it but if you don't want to give it up it's going to kill you it's going to cause your soul i want to just stop because i don't want to get too i don't want to mess with you too much praise god but i want you to go to heaven you know all of all of us stand in the gap for our families right and we pray for them are you with me because we want them to be saved are y'all with me and i want every one of you to be saved this morning it's time it's time to do something about sin in your life i'm gonna tell you something if you don't do something now when are you gonna do something i had some things i said death has been defeated i can show you scriptures people say i don't believe in god i don't believe this it don't make god not real you might not believe the sun shining outside but it's shining you don't you might not believe that the sign said 35 you said i don't believe i got to go 35 no 50 no 50. but it's still the signs that 55 the 35 and they got somebody didn't force that so when they enforce
