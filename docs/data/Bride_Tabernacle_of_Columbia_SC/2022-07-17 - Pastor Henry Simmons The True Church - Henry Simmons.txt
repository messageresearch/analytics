life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god 25. wherefore i take you to record this day that i'm pew from the blood of all men 27. take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the holy ghost has made you overseal to feed the church of god which he has purchased with his own blood 29 also of your cells of your own cells shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them thirty-one together and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give your inheritance among all them which are sanctified may god bless you in this word you may be seated praise god here it says in the 28th verse take heave therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock of god over which the holy ghost has made you overseal defeat the church of god which he has purchased with his own blood praise god to feed the church of god which he has purchased with his own blood now we want to talk this morning to you concerning the true church now there are many churches but we want to talk about the true church and in that we put emphasis on the true church then in the contrast there is a false church so the true church and when we speak of the true church um it was something that god's servant bought out he said the true church of jesus christ the bride the true church of jesus christ the bride is locking into pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he had has she is to manifest what he has she is to manifest there's no thought in her she's all glorious within and without from the beginning to the end she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god how can one phantom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for god has spoken it amen the true church in other words how do we view it by scripture describes him as christ who is our life for christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life without him she is simply a religious society a club a meaninglessly meaningless gathering of people or courts just like a dead person are you with me that's what she is we're dead without him without him we are just simply uh a courts corpse all right y'all got it but without him that's we just stand are you with me the bible tells us we were dead and trespassed and in sin so without him the true church now uh uh i got up by four o'clock this morning and i was just sitting there it says lord you know there's many things i could say this morning but i i started thinking about some of the things and the thing that was when i was laying down i couldn't sleep i was just talking about thinking about the love of god because we were talking about true love and i was thinking about the love of god and and as i was thinking on the love of god i just think about sometimes people have all kind of reason not to serve god and not to live for god and sometimes people have all kind of reason amen to to not go to church no more not worship no more not serve god no more and i thought about what paul says who shall separate me from the love of god amen and i thought about true love when you really got the love of god right then who should separate us from the love of god and and he said your tribulation of stress persecution of fame and amen sword and necklace who should separate us what what what what's going to get in our way and what's going to stop us from serving god amen i believe the true church she walks amen she has to suffer certain things but she walks in victory she'll let nothing separate us amen the true church amen for paul says amen she's led as a sheep counter to the slaughter amen nay in these things we are more than conquered amen through him that loves us are you with me we understand that he loves us amen though we are the latter the sheep to the slaughter but yay and all these things we're more than conquerors hallelujah amen he says and these things were more than conquered through him they loved us he said well i'm persuaded amen i i i'm convicted i'm persuaded amen i i you see it it it it's things going to come in life and things going to come in in the building of the church amen but the bible tells us that the gates of hell shall not prevail amen the true church amen don't worry about a thing the true church is stand amen everything yes can fall everything else can fail but the true churches stand she stands solid on the rock amen because she has a revelation of who she is amen it's been revealed amen to her they may receive the bride of jesus christ amen amen that jesus is a savior amen and she belongs to him she has a revelation i'm persuaded amen praise god it's something to give you such conviction that that you can pin it you can put it to pen and you can write i'm persuaded and neither death amen amen nothing going to stop me now i'm persuaded that neither death nor life praise god no angels not prince apologies nor powers no things present but things that come not things present not things to come i don't care what amen i praise god i've seen many folk when things come amen they just stop serving the lord things come amen praise god and they give up on god amen but things come amen sometimes death when he means somebody died they met a family member mother husband and wife amen death no life gonna separate me amen i'm persuaded amen angels amen somebody felt like an angel talked to him and and then then they they they just stopped coming to church they stopped serving the lord amen angel told me not angel paul said though we an angel come from heaven preach any other gospel in that which we preach he said let him be a curse amen not an angel amen praise god i'm persuaded see it's something about uh the love of god amen it goes deeper than principalities and powers and things present the things that come no height no depth not any other creature shall be able praise god shall be able as i was lying down i had to get up shall be evil praise god i it just it just brought so much down inside of me nothing shall be able amen praise god to separate me i love him that much [Music] amen i love him too much amen nothing shall be evil amen praise god hallelujah praise god i've seen some image soldiers of the cross the true church stands in the midst of conflict in the midst of persecution the true churches stand amen she goes through things but she stands on christ the solid rock our stand all other ground is sinking sin praise god you stand amen in victory stand saying thank you jesus anyhow amen god i thank you amen praise god i have to suffer sometime i have to cry sometimes but lord thank you amen that i'm able to cry hallelujah i'm able to testify the true church of stan hallelujah i i i i was looking uh amen after hebrew boys amen the fire couldn't stop him amen it couldn't separate them it may be even uh thousands in the in babylon bowed down to the image but amen but there was somebody that represented the true church amen and they stood up amen in the midst they throw me in the fire but my god is evil true church is standing praise god it may not be many but they'll stand praise god the true church amen when god promised that it's going to reign amen the true church praise god the truth praise god was make you free he said upon this rock i'll build my church amen god been doing it in the book of genesis amen the the church is built off of revelation they meant by faith ava offered a more extra sacrifice to that of king amen amen had a revelation because white amen the church is built off of revelation amen so ava had a revelation of what to offer to god amen cain didn't have that revelation the true church got a rep built off of revelation amen praise god god reveals himself to you as an individual when god saves you as an individual god amen draws you that's the true church the false would persecute the truth are you with me as cain did able cain killed his brother are you up man the false would always persecute amen the truth jesus was the true friend of life amen but the the religious the pharisees the sadducees and all persecute jesus because he was the word praise god he wasn't fighting against them they fought him he wasn't jealous of them they were jealous of him he didn't hate them they hated him without a cause are you up man praise god and i want you to know the true church amen recognize that his attributes are in you praise god how he stood the test you would stand because he's in you praise god hallelujah it's because of him you stand amen it's because the faith of the lord jesus christ amen you stand amen you take your stand with the truth praise god others take this stand with the church with some organization but you take your stand with the word some folk take this stand with a certain preacher a certain bishop or certain prophet a certain this a certain dot but you take your stand with the word praise god amen if the preacher's right amen the word is right amen if the prophet is right the word is right praise god this is what you're standing on the word the true church stands on the word and cannot be moved will not be moved shall not be moved the true church stands on the word the bible is your absolute praise god you stay with the word amen that's what the true church amen you see it written it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god the true church praise god hallelujah some fine folk amen i don't believe this and i don't believe uh brother simmons because they hadn't looked at the word i don't believe uh uh uh brothers uh pastor so and so amen it ought to be the word amen and then if if they if they fail to believe amen the the word amen then people got a problem with the word amen and they walk away from the word amen it's saying that i don't believe the word praise god it ought to be the bible you are not falling in love with the church you ought to fall in love with jesus christ for he is the word amen praise god paul says i hadn't shown decline to you they met the whole council of god they met praise god paul knew that amen that he was going to depart off the scene where he said i finished my course amen uh uh amen i i i i'll come to the end of my journey amen but i want to tell you something that i'm getting ready to leave here but after my departure grievous wood's going to come in not spam the flock amen even men of your own cells i know some of you amen he said some of you sat here now amen you going to be one of the ones the amen praise god jesus sat down at the table he said amen i ever not i've chosen you 12 and one of you the devil amen amen he knew that judas was with him right there brother and sister no jew amen think it's strange amen that there'll be some that amen will shut down and eat with you amen but to be against you some that are sat down they'll be against you amen but they're against the word praise god they look at the bible and they don't esteem every word of god being the truth but every word of god is the truth it just don't start at a certain place but from genesis to revelation it's the word of god praise god but sometimes we have problems amen praise god of our church don't believe that if our preacher don't believe that or uh uh uh if i don't see that if it's the word of god amen he didn't ask you to seize it amen praise god you got to take god by faith and not by sight but you say i don't understand you amen praise god but except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom he cannot see the kingdom of god he cannot understand the kingdom of god it takes a new birth it takes the holy ghost without the holy ghost amen you can't understand the love praise god so without the baptism of the holy ghost it's hard it's difficult to understand now brothers and sisters let's go to colossians the true church amen praise god colossians 1 god is good amen colossians 1 and 17. it says oh excuse me and he is before all things and by him all things consists are you with me and he is the what the church is his body he is the head of the body the what he's the head are you with me here is the head amen you your head amen the church the true church has one head one head praise god it don't have two heads the true church got one head and that head ain't brother simmons or bishop simmons or elder symbol however you want to call it there's one hand and that head jesus christ his it's his church because he approaches the church with what it wasn't my blood but it was his blood the church is the purchase of jesus christ it pissed blood amen it don't belong to the pope it don't belong to the archbishop it don't belong to the pastor praise god you've been purchased with the blood of jesus christ praise god don't let no man fool you don't let no man deceive you amen you the purchase of jesus christ you're bought with the price and that's the precious blood of jesus amen praise god some folks are trying to own you some churches are trying to own you they'll try to lay claims on you praise god but you ain't praise god you've been precious with the blood amen praise god you're members of one body amen and that the body of jesus christ you're members of his body are you a man so don't let nobody see a folks are trying to lick claims on you that you belong to this particular church in that particular church you said there ain't but one church that i belong to praise god hallelujah and that's his church that he patches with his own blood that's a wire church glory to god oh she's a word bride hallelujah see what happens amen we hold dear to to to a certain uh uh church in certain organizations certain men amen you might love uh see the trouble with the church even even back then some said i'm appalled i'm of a polos and i'm a cephalus amen and paul had to correct you did paul die for you peter didn't die for you apollos didn't die for you but jesus died for you amen well he said one planet of the water but amen except god give increase you you're nothing god give the increase are you with me amen we get caught up i think amen we're thinking man in the place of god amen god can use the man thank god for the man but we want god to have the prayer of the word to have the preeminence are y'all with me don't put no man in the place of jesus christ don't put no church in the place of jesus christ but he is the word praise god the true church recognized that she recognized that she has one head are you with me yes we want you to respect the pastor respect over seal but you got one hand are you with me give respect honor we honestly amen respect okay it says and he's the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the what preeminence for it please the father that in him shall what all fullness dwell thank god god wants the preeminence in his church god wants full control of your lives he wants to bring imminence in his church amen he wants control he wants to to be your head the one that dictates to you amen how oh god hallelujah oh that he said let this mind be in you that was also in christ god wants to emit be your mind he wants to be your thinking he wants to be amen amen when you talk he wants to be your your voice he wants to be everything to you amen god wants to be your all in all god wants hallelujah that's why paul said is no more i didn't live but christ that living in me is no more me but it's him oh if we can just surrender ourselves to him and amen that's what the church of god the true church would do she would render his earth set to him in such a way the true church is a pentecostal church the true church is the book of acts church amen amen what what happened in the book of acts should be happening in her amen in your life not not just in a building not in a group but in you as an individual are you with me the church amen this is this is the individual walk amen god deals with you as an individual thank god amen praise god by the true church let nothing separate praise god sometimes we let husband we let wife we let children we let family we let different things separate us amen but you got to stay with the word praise god and mama don't stay with the world you stay with the word that daddy don't stay with the word you stay with the word that father don't stay with the word you stay with the word praise god for that show amen that's your head your headship is the word it's christ jesus christ and he is the word oh lord now he's the head amen and in the 20 same chapter amen praise god 24th verse he's the head he's the body head of the body he says in the 23rd verse if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven wherever i paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my suffering for you and fill up that which is behind of my affliction of christ in my flesh for his what for his body's sake which is what the church is his body are you with me and that's what we got to understand it's not not it's not the organization it's not the pastor it's not the bishop it's the church it's his body don't get confused with that don't oh this you know sometimes we glorify and we lift man up in a place where you all knocked it we lift the building up amen some folk are fighting over buildings and over over organizations and they want to be a part of this and a part of some social club but this is not a social club this is the word of god amen god wants you to be saved amen and jesus christ is our savior he's our lord amen the church belongs to him it don't blow amen to no man no man has the right to have preeminence over him amen jesus christ amen through the holy ghost purchased it with his own blood the bible says it you know man make bishops the man make ordained preachers man made preachers amen but he said take heed to the flock over the witch what amen so people when they get a a a man made a doctor dd or degree they think amen i'm a preacher but amen god didn't say he didn't never give a man a dd amen he didn't ever give a church amen that okay you become a part of the organization so you're part of the church the church is purchased with his own blood amen and he said take heed to the flock over the witch the holy ghost may not the bishop amen not the i mean they're not the adults but the holy ghost made you overseer praise god the holy ghost is in control of his church the true church the holy ghost got him praise god don't worry about it you say well well you gotta yeah you gotta have jesus that's what you gotta have you gotta have the holy ghost you gotta be born again don't belittle that amen nothing wrong with the amen some of these things but they meant when man amen takes his his rules and his regulation and his creeds and his dogmas and exalt that over the word of god and tell you you got to keep that amen praise god you got to hey hey wait a minute if what god is saying amen you're going to take that and let that rule over me praise god you're going to take what amen what man say to rule over me it's the word of god that's my head amen amen praise god he said to eve god of dies you'll be that i hug and he shall rule over you isn't that right and who's going to rule over me it's the word of god praise god over to which the holy ghost has made you holy the holy ghost got to be to oversee you brother sister it's the holy ghost that's in charge of the church praise god and if you let amen anybody else amen take a charge of the church it's false it won't work praise god i don't care who try to run and who tried to pass it who tried to be the overseer it's the holy ghost it's going to be in control it's got to operate under the power of the holy ghost amen in the holy ghost is in the church then signs and wonders will come forth then the power of god will take over amen we'll see god in the midst amen we'll see tongues and interpretations of tongues we'll see healings and miracles and signs and wonders we'll see god on the scene because he said that's when the holy ghost is real praise god and we don't see it in our lives and praise god then something is wrong we're cooled off we got in a place amen praise god we don't want to be a dead coach of course amen but we want to be living epistles written in red of all men we want to see the fire of god in your life we want to see the power of god activated we want to see jesus amen we want to say lord have your way with me god i want you to have preeminence god i want to oh your power amen the bible says in ephesians 2 in uh 20 it says and while you turn it now just read the the 18th verse the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance where in the saints amen it's something in you amen let me read that again the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the richest of the glory of his inheritance where in the sanks oh and what is the exceeding greatness of his what power to us lord who believe according to the working of his uh mighty what power that's ephesians 2 and and 19. now i'm going to ephesians 2 20. it says which is wrought in christ when he what raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places far above all what the prince of policies and powers far above all principalities and powers amen and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but excuse me i see that i'm going i'm reading i read ephesian one and everybody stopped but that was good anyway that's a where i ain't getting to my verse yet let me go on and just read what i said where is they feed the it i'm supposed to be in ephesian two okay it says uh 20. it says and are built upon the foundation of the word the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being what chief cornerstone in whom also what the buildings fit the frame together until what the holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are built together for what inhabitation god through the spirit amen you're built upon the foundations of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself me and the chief tony stone somebody said we don't need apostles no more we don't need prophets no more but that's what you're built upon amen the original church of the book of acts amen the true church will be a pattern of the original what it was in the original show shall it be at the end she would always pattern herself after the the original church the first church she would pattern herself the same if they had apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers amen if they had it in the original church then it should be in the end are you with me now you say well there's no more apostles no more prophets and no more well it shouldn't mean no more preachers are you with me shouldn't be no more church because if what it was in the original why if it's original amen and that's what the message of the hour was all about to restore your back back to the original church back to the origin of power you should be expecting what happened in the book of acts that happened in the church and if it's not happening we need to pray we need to find and seek god because that's what's supposed to be happening in my life amen if it is not happening in my life i got to get a hold of god god if you're god and if you did it then then you're the same god today as you were yesterday what happened we cooled off what happened people are not expecting those things to happen for them they expecting they meant them to come to church hear a good charming but for them actually to be the church for them to be the church praise god it's another thing they put it off as a building an organization a group a preacher but then as an individual i am the church and the things that i read about in the bible that is me god amen if you call me into your church amen i'm blood bought amen praise god and i've been purchased with the blood amen and i'm bought with the price amen oh amen you're the head and i'm the body then the body should even be operating amen lock the head operate praise god hallelujah praise god what the heck said the party ought to be doing amen hallelujah glory to jesus i'm excited about the word ephesians 5. and and but it's it's too often how long are you going to sit around and say i'm in the church and just you know listen to the sermon saying good song but really look at the book of acts and and and just say well is that happening in my life why isn't it not why is it not happening in my life and my experience what they experience if even if i'm not experiencing that shall i be satisfied just coming to church and singing songs and then we have all kind of fussing and stewing why because god ain't doing nothing with you as an individual we'll be looking at all the kind of things there's something wrong with the lights something wrong with the copies wrong with this something wrong with that we'll be thinking about all kind of stuff but we're thinking about spiritual stuff and we're praying and seeking for a walk with god and for god not the building to be the church but you as an individual to be the church me as an individual in my life amen not looking at somebody else's life but i'm looking at god amen god i want you to be live through me i want you to be living in me i as an individual but we could look down at us down the street and say so glad i'm not in that church i'm in this church i'm so glad i'm not like them i'm like uh-uh uh-uh look in the bible amen the bible said mark the perfect man i'm gonna follow jesus i want to be like jesus i want to be like him amen that's who i want to be like i don't want to be like another church i don't want to be like another preacher but i want to be like jesus are you a man praise god that's the perfect man that's who i want to be like amen that's what you ought to want to be like the true church amen those are people striving to be like jesus amen praise god they want to walk like him talk like and live like him amen praise god that's the true church but the rest of it just just a society just a secret club or something you join it and john john the club and amen and you do what the little rules and regulations carry out join the fraternity or whatever and you know go through you know you know your rituals and all and that's what folks have done but to really look at the church as being an individual amen that's amen has a revealed knowledge god has revealed himself to her amen praise god and she knows who she is and she's walking in the steps footsteps of jesus christ and she understand that she's the word amen and that's what happens that's why why people cool off because they're so accustomed to just doing they're not praying and seeking god god amen i see this bible this bible is real i wanted to i want to be real lord i want i want to be like you lord i want to live like you i want to walk like you lord i love you i want you jesus i want more of you see that's all that ought to be our desire that ought to be what we want that's what we desire of god but instead we go to church we wonder about the songs we wonder about you know about the preaching if the preacher's preaching the word according to amen what's written amen thank god for it amen but all the other little carnal thoughts but as we look at our lives examine what we are amen are we up to or do we need more do we need to lord let's get my can i get my house in order lord because you are the church you're the house of god you're the temple of the holy ghost amen he said destroy this temple in three days what i'll raise it up again what temple what's he talking about he's talking about his body isn't that right praise god you are the body of jesus christ isn't that right so let's not focus on these carnal things but let's focus on amen jesus christ i gotta i gotta close uh but by the grace of god here we are he says i said ephesians 5 is in 23 it says husband look for the husband is the what 5 and 23. for the husband is the what even as christ is the what and he is what wherefore as the church is subject to christ so let the wise be to their wife their own husbands and what huh huh and what is that what the preachers say is that what the preachers say see and what y'all you know sometimes we find it difficult you do your part and god is obligated to do his spar you're responsible to god to do what you're supposed to do are you with me okay and everything amen husband what now okay now they got their part husband what okay so it's got that part too husband what love your wives even as what love the church and what now that's why you don't mind being subject into everything because he loves you so much are you with me because of the love he's shown towards you you ought to willingly be subject to him because he loves you so much are you with me oh god i can't get on marriage let's go let's go home y'all ain't ready [Music] is that all right the church is his body isn't that right y'all too quiet in here god is good amen we got a party place the church he purchased it with his what y'all watch out watch out when when when when there's a nickelodeon spirit man try to have preeminence over you you got to listen to me me me me uh-uh you got to listen to the word and you respect the man but you got to listen to the word men will take you and lead you off in some kind of creeds and darker some creeds of bylaws next thing you know women will be standing in the pulpit preaching and everything they don't disrespect of the bible they say this abomination in the sight of god for woman the way that which pertaining to a man but they disrespect the bible isn't that right so folks don't care what the bible said they do what they want are you with me and for a man to put on a dress isn't that right but folks don't care what the bible say the church has been purchased with his own blood and he tells us the word we are subject to the word are you with me so if you want to be in god's church you got to be born again provide one spirit will be baptized into one body the church is his body you get in the church by being born again amen for by one spirit are we baptized into one body amen praise god you can join any church but to get in the true church you got to be born again you got to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and the promise is you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost are you with me now man can't give you the holy ghost so man can baptize you are you with me god gives you the holy ghost amen and the holy ghost put you in the church the spirit puts you in the body are you with me so man can put you in the church but man put you in the church and put you out to church because he put you in he can put you out but a man didn't put you in the holy ghost what made you a part of the body praise god hallelujah and then god put you in amen no man can put you out praise god amen you can leave this building you can leave bright tavern i could never leave jesus are you with me because

name the book of acts church says peter stood up when they said these men are full of new wine and peter said these men are not drunk and you supposed sinners but the third hour of the day but this is that which is spoken of by the prophet joel that in the last days said god that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy young men should see vision all men should dream dreams and all my servant and all my handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs and earth beneath blood and fire and vapors of smoke the sun should be turned into darkness and the moon in the blood before the great notable day of the lord come and it should come to pass that whosoever should call upon the name of the lord shall be saved amen amen jesus god we look to you now look to your word trust you now maybe one today that peter stood up on that day book of acts church in the original church at the beginning they said the same jesus you're taking the wicked hands you're crucified and slain whom god has raised it up god loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it the same jesus that you killed god raised him up made him move lord in christ when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do said then peter said unto them repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost or one of the day if there was one there's one today that would repent of your sin i want to be a part of the region of church i want to be in that church the church that was in the first church in the beginning is our
