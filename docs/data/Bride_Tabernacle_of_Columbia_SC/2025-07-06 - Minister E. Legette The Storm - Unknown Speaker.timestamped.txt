[44:14] straight gate, for wide is the gate, and
[44:16] broad is the way that leadth to
[44:18] destruction, and many there be which go
[44:20] there in there at. Because straight is
[44:24] the gate, and narrow is the way, which
[44:26] leadth unto eternal life, and few there
[44:29] be that what?
[44:31] Beware of false prophets, which come to
[44:33] you in sheep clothing, but inwardly they
[44:35] are revenanting wolves. Ye shall know
[44:37] them by their what? fruits. Do men
[44:41] gather grapes of thorns or figs of
[44:43] thistles? Even so, every good tree
[44:47] bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt
[44:49] tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good
[44:52] tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,
[44:54] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[44:56] good fruit. Every tree that bringeth
[44:58] forth not good fruit is heuned down and
[45:00] cast into the fire, whereby their fruits
[45:03] sh ye shall know them. Not every man
[45:06] that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
[45:08] enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he
[45:10] that doeth what?
[45:12] The will of my father which is in
[45:14] heaven. You may be seated. I'm going to
[45:15] read a little further down. He says,
[45:17] "Not everyone that says Lord, Lord."
[45:19] Right? He says, "But you got to do the
[45:22] will." Right? Come on. Because there's a
[45:24] lot that say Lord, Lord, but they don't
[45:26] do the will. Amen. But he said to them
[45:29] that do the will, right? my father which
[45:32] is in heaven. Many will say to me in
[45:34] that day, Lord, Lord, have not we
[45:36] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[45:39] have cast out devils and in thy name
[45:41] done many many wonderful works. Then I
[45:45] then will I profess unto them I never
[45:47] knew ye. Depart from me ye that work in
[45:50] iniquity. Therefore whosoever heareth
[45:54] these things of mine and do what?
[45:58] Doeth them. Amen. I will liken him unto
[46:01] a wise man, which built his house upon a
[46:05] rock. And when the rain descended, and
[46:07] the floods came, and the winds blew, and
[46:10] beat upon that house, and it fell not,
[46:14] for it was founded upon a rock. And
[46:17] everyone that heareth these things of
[46:19] mine, if doing them not, shall be
[46:22] likened unto a foolish man, which built
[46:25] his house upon the sand. And the rains
[46:28] descended, and the floods came, the
[46:31] winds blew, and beat upon the house, and
[46:34] it fell, and great was the fall of it.
[46:37] And it came to pass when Jesus had ended
[46:40] these sayings, the people were
[46:42] astonished at his doctrine, for he
[46:44] taught them as one having authority and
[46:47] not as the scribes. May God had a
[46:50] blessed reading of his word. this
[46:52] morning just for a moment I want to talk
[46:54] to you on on the quiet before the storm.
[46:57] Amen. Or we want to talk about the
[47:00] oncoming storm. Amen. Come on.
[47:03] The oncoming storm. It's evident in each
[47:06] and every one of our lives that storms
[47:08] are come. Right? Many times people want
[47:10] to live this life but they don't want to
[47:12] go through nothing. Right? And that's
[47:14] and that's the way of every human being.
[47:16] You don't want to say I want to go
[47:18] through something. Right? But it's
[47:20] evident that the storms will come in
[47:22] your life, right? But the storms that
[47:25] come in your life, they're coming to
[47:26] try. Let's say this morning, they're
[47:29] coming to try what you built on. Right?
[47:31] Come on. But if you built right, then
[47:34] the storms that come won't knock you
[47:35] out, will they? But when you ain't built
[47:38] right, that's when you're going to have
[47:40] all the trouble in life. Right? You're
[47:42] going to have trouble when the house
[47:44] ain't built right. Right? So no matter
[47:46] you know sitting here today we find that
[47:48] many of people go to church right many
[47:51] of people profess God and say Lord Lord
[47:54] right but everybody ain't doing the will
[47:57] of God right many people building houses
[48:00] but that don't mean their house built
[48:02] right right sometimes you might get a
[48:04] contractor or something to come build a
[48:05] house and you might say I'm experienced
[48:08] I know what I'm doing I've been doing it
[48:10] for 20 years right but he could have
[48:12] been doing it for 20 years in the wrong
[48:14] way Right. And it just so happened that
[48:16] the right storm ain't come yet. But when
[48:19] the right storm come, it's going to try
[48:21] that house, right? And all the houses
[48:23] that he built, ain't it? Come on. Oh,
[48:26] Jesus. But when the house is built,
[48:28] right? Right. No matter what storm come,
[48:31] tornado, whatever come, hurricanes,
[48:33] right? When it's all over, hallelujah,
[48:36] that house will still be standing, won't
[48:38] it? Oh Jesus. I thank God this morning
[48:42] that when it's all over, Hallelujah.
[48:44] nothing going to stand but what? The
[48:46] word of God. Hallelujah. So, I'm asking
[48:49] you this morning, what are you building
[48:50] your house on? Come on. Are you building
[48:52] it on a church? Come on. Are you
[48:55] building on something somebody told you?
[48:57] Right? Are you building it on mama or
[48:59] daddy experience? What is your house
[49:01] built on this morning? Because it is
[49:03] only one thing that's going to stand and
[49:05] that's what the word of God. How many
[49:07] believe that this morning? Why? Because
[49:10] it's a rock, ain't it? Oh Jesus.
[49:14] A lot of times you building. You
[49:15] building this morning. Whether you think
[49:16] about it or not, you building, right?
[49:19] Jesus said, "The ones that hear his word
[49:21] and do it, they building, right?" And he
[49:23] says they building on a what? On a rock.
[49:26] Hallelujah. He says, "But the ones that
[49:29] hears my word and don't do it, they
[49:31] building, ain't they?" But what are they
[49:33] building on? Sand. Ain't it? Come on.
[49:36] But when the storm come, hallelujah.
[49:39] Oh Jesus. And that's what it is. You
[49:41] know, Jesus talked about that that
[49:43] storm, right? Storms that's going to
[49:45] come in lives, right? Oh jeez. I like
[49:48] that's why I like that they were saying
[49:50] saying he moved so many mountains out of
[49:52] my way, right? And I'm going to go a
[49:54] little further and say, not only has he
[49:55] moved many mountains out of my way, but
[49:57] he called a peace to so many storms in
[50:00] my way. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. You know,
[50:03] out there, somebody says, "I've been in
[50:04] a storm too long." Hallelujah. But don't
[50:07] you know it's one that can call a peace
[50:09] to the storm. Come on. It's one that can
[50:12] make the storm cease. You don't have to
[50:14] be in that storm no more. Hallelujah. Go
[50:16] wake Jesus up. Come on. Oh God.
[50:20] Hallelujah. But we find that I says that
[50:22] you know what what it builds on depicts
[50:25] right of what's going to happen. You
[50:28] find many of times come on. And and I
[50:30] said it the other week that you'll find
[50:32] many people that's been been Christians.
[50:35] Sometimes they be preachers, right? They
[50:37] walk with the Lord for many, many years,
[50:39] right? But when the storm come, it just
[50:42] look like they don't know what to do,
[50:44] right? Look like they come to the end
[50:46] and and they don't know how to get a
[50:48] breakthrough, right? They might have
[50:50] said, "I preached it so many years and
[50:51] and told people about it, but I don't
[50:53] even know how to get a breakthrough
[50:55] myself." Right? Because it comes a time
[50:57] when there's no more pretending. Right?
[51:00] Come a time when you got to know that
[51:02] he's real. Come on. You come to those
[51:05] places in life where you say, "Lord, if
[51:07] you don't help me, I'll die right here."
[51:09] Come on. Come to those places in life
[51:12] where your enemies is going to meet you
[51:14] and you say, "God, I can't let you go."
[51:16] Hallelujah. Until you bless me, I need
[51:19] something from you. I can't just keep
[51:21] going in and coming out, but God, I need
[51:24] something real in my life. I need you to
[51:26] show yourself alive and well by many
[51:29] infallible proofs. Come on. Oh, Jesus.
[51:33] We meet those places in life, don't we?
[51:35] Come on. I don't know if I'm talking to
[51:37] somebody that met those places before.
[51:39] Hallelujah. Somebody that been in that
[51:41] storm. Hallelujah. And they know that if
[51:43] God didn't intervene, hallelujah, then
[51:46] they didn't know what was going to
[51:47] happen, but they prayed long enough.
[51:49] Hallelujah. They stayed on their knees
[51:51] long enough.
[51:53] Come on. And God showed up.
[51:56] Come on. And then their testimony is if
[51:58] he showed up then, he'll show up now.
[52:01] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus, if he did it once,
[52:04] he'll do it again. Oh God, don't you
[52:08] thank God for that? Hallelujah. That's
[52:10] what those testimonies, those storms,
[52:12] Jesus talked about the wind blowing,
[52:14] right? Come on. The wind is just one
[52:16] part of the storm, ain't it? Come on.
[52:18] Some people house can't stand the wind,
[52:20] can it? But then the rains come, right?
[52:23] Come on. The rain sometime don't let up.
[52:25] Hallelujah.
[52:27] But it keep raining, right? Then all of
[52:29] a sudden the flood come, right? And then
[52:31] the flood. But one going to knock you
[52:33] out, right? But it don't matter when you
[52:35] built right. Hallelujah. Come on. When
[52:38] you when you got saved right from the
[52:40] beginning, right? It wasn't just a fly
[52:42] by day or night, but it was something
[52:44] that happened down in your soul.
[52:46] Hallelujah. It was something that
[52:48] reached you. Come on. That it was more
[52:50] than just I just jumped, I just shouted,
[52:52] I just uh uh spoke in tongues, but it
[52:55] was something that happened down in my
[52:57] soul. Hallelujah. that when I don't feel
[52:59] like he near, something in my soul tells
[53:02] me he'll never leave me nor forsake me.
[53:05] Something in my soul's telling me
[53:07] everything is going to be all right.
[53:09] Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Come on. But it's
[53:12] got to be down in your soul, right?
[53:15] Come on. I was telling the testimony,
[53:17] you know, the other week about how, you
[53:20] know, how deadly those tornadoes are.
[53:22] Come on. They pretty bad, right? You say
[53:25] that. I was saying the other week, you
[53:27] know, out there in the Midwest and how
[53:29] those tornadoes, they come out of
[53:31] nowhere, right? Soon as the dark clouds
[53:34] start coming, everybody afraid. They
[53:35] looking to see if they see that tail.
[53:37] That's what we used to call, that tail
[53:38] coming out the sky, right? Because you
[53:40] don't know. They unpredictable most of
[53:42] the time, right? And they'll come up so
[53:45] fast. Sometimes you'll see them go in a
[53:47] neighborhood and tear up one or two
[53:49] houses and don't mess with nobody else
[53:50] house. Sometimes they'll go hit. They
[53:53] unpredictable, right? You can't
[53:54] determine the path of it, right? But
[53:57] it's one thing about it I know.
[53:58] Hallelujah. That I might not be able to
[54:01] determine the path, but I know who's the
[54:02] maker of the winds. Hallelujah. Who's
[54:05] the creator of the rains? He can direct
[54:07] that, can't he? Come on. And whatever he
[54:10] allowed. Hallelujah. That I'm fine with
[54:12] it. Right. But I know one thing. It
[54:14] might shake. It might blow. It might
[54:16] tear up. But one thing, it can't uproot.
[54:19] That's the word down in my soul.
[54:21] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on. But those
[54:25] those tornadoes, they pretty dangerous,
[54:27] ain't they? We talking about storms this
[54:29] morning, right? Come on. They pretty
[54:31] dangerous. And I know out there in the
[54:33] Midwest, a lot of times the people say
[54:35] that, you know, I'd rather live in a
[54:37] tornado than a earthquake, earthquake or
[54:40] a hurricane, right? Because they never
[54:42] had to experience it before. Many of us
[54:45] that experienced hurricane said we'd
[54:47] rather have them than the tornadoes or
[54:49] the earthquakes cuz at least the weather
[54:51] man can tell us that they coming, right?
[54:53] And we can prepare for them. Then those
[54:55] that are out west say I'd rather have a
[54:57] earthquake, right? Then the tornado does
[55:00] because they never experienced certain
[55:01] things. But now we're living in an hour
[55:04] where we experiencing all three. Amen.
[55:06] You don't know whether the earthquake
[55:08] coming tomorrow. You don't know whether
[55:10] tornado gonna hit today. You don't know
[55:12] when the hurricane is coming. We're
[55:14] experiencing all three. Hallelujah. But
[55:17] you know I know one wind. Hallelujah.
[55:20] That's greater than all the tornadoes.
[55:22] One wind that can turn every hurricane.
[55:24] One rock that can hold through every
[55:26] earthquake. And that's the word of God.
[55:28] Hallelujah. And that's what I'm resting
[55:31] in. Let it shake. Let it blow.
[55:33] Hallelujah. My trust is in who? God.
[55:37] Hallelujah. Is that what your trust is
[55:38] in this morning? Come on. The storm.
[55:41] Come on. I know that. I said that. What
[55:43] it is many things times in our lives.
[55:46] Come on. We've been talking about
[55:47] storms. Why? Because the world is
[55:49] experiencing a storm today, ain't it?
[55:51] They calling for peace, but they don't
[55:53] know when the bombs going to start
[55:54] falling, right? Somebody told me the
[55:56] president was talking to Russia
[55:58] yesterday and then all of a sudden after
[56:00] that, while he was on the phone with
[56:01] him, whole bunch of bombs hit Ukraine.
[56:03] Come on. Don't know. You can't trust
[56:05] nobody, right? Man's word ain't his bond
[56:08] no more, is it? Come on. He tell you
[56:10] something, he'll lie to you. Right? But
[56:12] it's only one that we can trust. It's
[56:14] only one that ain't going to lie to you.
[56:16] Hallelujah. It's only one that's going
[56:18] to give you the truth upon the truth.
[56:19] Hallelujah. It's only one that when he
[56:21] make you a promise, he'll keep that
[56:23] promise, won't he? Come on. He'll do
[56:27] just what he said.
[56:29] He ain't never fail yet. Never will he
[56:31] fail. Come on. That's where my trust in.
[56:35] Oh, men are liars. Come on. But God's
[56:38] word is true.
[56:40] Come on. Do you believe that this
[56:41] morning? Come on. Don't let me be
[56:43] excited by myself this morning. Come on.
[56:46] God is good, ain't it?
[56:47] Come on. But the storm. Hallelujah. Come
[56:50] on. I I says that many of times, you
[56:52] know, uh uh the way it ends up in your
[56:54] life, right? It ain't had to end up that
[56:57] way, right? Many of times is the storm
[57:00] hit and it's way worse on people than it
[57:02] should have been. Why? Because they
[57:04] weren't prepared for it, right? And it
[57:07] wasn't that they they they didn't have
[57:09] the the the the the will to prepare for
[57:11] it. They just let that little thing
[57:14] called procrastination come in. Right.
[57:17] Little spirit come in here. I might have
[57:19] a little bit more time. Right. Come on.
[57:21] But those storms now. We looking in
[57:24] natural, but we talking spiritual as
[57:25] well. Come on. They coming up so fast.
[57:28] You ain't got time to prepare. Right.
[57:30] You say the sun was just shining. Where'
[57:32] those clouds come from? Look on the
[57:35] radar. ain't even sure you're on the
[57:36] radar. They just forming out of nowhere,
[57:39] right? But to the man that's prepared
[57:41] for the storm. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus.
[57:45] Might come today, might come tomorrow.
[57:48] Nevertheless, I'm trusting in God.
[57:50] Hallelujah. Nevertheless, I'm trusting
[57:52] in the right shelter. Come on. Oh Jesus.
[57:56] My shelter is in God. I don't have to be
[57:58] feared with the bombs that's falling. I
[58:00] don't have to be feared with the war
[58:02] that's breaking out because I know one
[58:04] thing. He'll keep me. He'll hold me in
[58:06] his hands. Come on. How many believe
[58:09] that this morning? Oh Jesus. Somebody
[58:11] give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[58:13] Come on. He'll hold you this morning.
[58:16] That says what it is. Those storms come
[58:18] so rapidly, don't they?
[58:19] Come on.
[58:22] They come in way. You know, I always
[58:24] say, well, we looking at in the natural,
[58:26] it's a spiritual application to it,
[58:28] ain't it?
[58:29] Come on. The world today worried about
[58:31] the wars and all that, but look at all
[58:32] the natural disasters they can't do
[58:34] nothing with. And they'll tell you their
[58:36] self, if this happen, we ain't ready for
[58:38] it. Hallelujah. Well, if you know that
[58:40] this could happen, then why you ain't
[58:42] getting ready? That's the problem,
[58:43] right? I mean, that's the question. Why
[58:45] ain't you getting ready? Right? Come on.
[58:47] Why ain't you? You know that the
[58:49] bridegroom could call you at any time,
[58:51] right? Why don't you have enough all?
[58:53] But that thing is people think maybe he
[58:56] might not come tonight. I'll wait till
[58:57] in the morning, right? But in midnight
[58:59] the cry was made. Right? At the time you
[59:02] didn't think. That's why he said you
[59:04] need to watch as well as what? Pray.
[59:05] Hallelujah. Cuz you don't know the hour
[59:09] that the Lord will come. Right? He'll
[59:11] come when you think he ain't going to
[59:12] come. Right? He'll come when you think
[59:14] that you that you that you ain't ready
[59:16] and all those things. That's when he'll
[59:17] come. But the thing is when you're
[59:19] ready. Hallelujah. He can come at any
[59:22] time. Right. God, I'm ready. Not just
[59:26] cuz I think I'm ready, but I'm on my
[59:28] knees. Hallelujah. And I'm crying out,
[59:30] God.
[59:31] Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Come on. But I
[59:35] say one thing about it. You know that
[59:37] that they ain't have to happen if people
[59:39] was ready for Right. Come on. You know,
[59:41] I was thinking about Job.
[59:43] Job had some storms, didn't he? Come on.
[59:46] In the storms, maybe he didn't think the
[59:49] storms was going to come. He might have
[59:50] had that further away from his mind. But
[59:53] one thing about Job, he was ready,
[59:54] wasn't he?
[59:55] Come on. He went out, went on ahead and
[59:57] make his sacrifices, right? Man, my
[59:59] children ain't did nothing yet, but
[1:00:01] perav do something, right? Come on. I
[1:00:04] don't see no clouds gathering, but Lord,
[1:00:06] if the clouds do start gathering, right?
[1:00:08] I want to already have my sacrifices
[1:00:10] made. Come on. I want to already be
[1:00:12] ready for when the storm is coming.
[1:00:14] Right. So, I know that it might not look
[1:00:16] like nothing right now, but if it come
[1:00:18] now, I want to be ready. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:00:21] going to make my sacrifice. Perventure.
[1:00:24] Come on. Oh Jesus. And while he was
[1:00:27] sitting there, it looked like everything
[1:00:28] was calm. All of a sudden, the storm
[1:00:31] came out of nowhere, didn't it? Come on.
[1:00:33] Oh Jesus. All of a sudden, he lost all
[1:00:36] this. He lost all that. Right.
[1:00:39] Before but before the wind stopped
[1:00:41] blowing, somebody come tell him the rain
[1:00:44] falling. Right before the rain stopped
[1:00:46] falling, somebody come in the dark, the
[1:00:48] floods is coming. Come on, just
[1:00:50] paraphrasing it. Before they quit
[1:00:52] talking about the floods coming,
[1:00:54] somebody come in the door. Earthquakes
[1:00:55] hitting, right? Oh, Jesus. Before they
[1:00:58] get done with that, sometimes you say,
[1:01:00] "Lord, when is it going to stop?"
[1:01:03] Come on. But Job thing was, hallelujah.
[1:01:07] Naked I came and naked I leave.
[1:01:09] Blessed be the name of what? God.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah. He give and he take away.
[1:01:15] I'm ready for the storm. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:01:18] Jesus. Come on. Hallelujah. He was
[1:01:20] ready, wasn't he? Come on. But one thing
[1:01:23] about it, you know why he could be
[1:01:25] ready? You know why those things
[1:01:27] couldn't shake him? Because that ain't
[1:01:29] where his confidence was, right? Come
[1:01:31] on. His confidence wasn't in the money
[1:01:34] that he had, was it? His confidence
[1:01:36] wasn't in the the insurance he had on
[1:01:38] the house, right? Oh, Jesus. His
[1:01:41] confidence wasn't in all his friends and
[1:01:43] all that, right? His confidence wasn't
[1:01:45] even in his health, was it? Come on. His
[1:01:47] confidence wasn't even in his wife, was
[1:01:49] it? Wasn't even in his children. But
[1:01:51] where was his confidence at? Come on.
[1:01:53] That I know that my what? My redeemer
[1:01:56] live. Come on. And in the last day,
[1:01:58] he'll stand on the earth. Hallelujah.
[1:02:00] Though the skin worms eat my flesh. Oh,
[1:02:02] it might get bad, but he'll call my name
[1:02:06] one day. And I'll answer the call.
[1:02:08] Hallelujah. I'll hear them. I'll stand
[1:02:11] again. Come on. I'll smile again. I'll
[1:02:14] Oh, Jesus. Come on. My joy is coming
[1:02:17] back. Come on. Oh Jesus. Come on. Do you
[1:02:21] believe God like that this morning? Come
[1:02:23] on. But it's true, right?
[1:02:25] It's true. Come on. Those storms come so
[1:02:28] fast, don't they?
[1:02:30] Come on. You might see, hey, I thought
[1:02:32] they were doing good today. They gone
[1:02:33] tomorrow.
[1:02:35] Come on.
[1:02:36] Storm come super fast, don't it?
[1:02:38] Oh, I got a little bit tired. Can wait.
[1:02:40] Come on. Tomorrow sickness hit, right?
[1:02:43] Tomorrow they give you a a call. Only
[1:02:45] happened to me twice. Call you on the
[1:02:47] job. Hey, we got to give you a furlow
[1:02:49] papers. Came from out of nowhere. Came
[1:02:51] super fast. Right. Come on. Say, "Were
[1:02:54] you prepared?" I know one thing. God's
[1:02:57] got it all in his hands. Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] Come on. I know who my provider is.
[1:03:01] Right. See, I wouldn't be prepared if my
[1:03:04] confidence was in those things. But I
[1:03:06] feel like Job. Though he slay me yet,
[1:03:08] I'll trust him. Though he take
[1:03:10] everything away yet, I'll trust him.
[1:03:12] Though this might happen all friends
[1:03:14] turn away, I'm going still trust God.
[1:03:16] I'm going stand in the word of God and
[1:03:18] believe that all things work together
[1:03:21] for the good of them that love God. Come
[1:03:23] on. Oh Jesus. And I believe that. Do you
[1:03:27] believe that this morning? Come on. But
[1:03:29] it's the truth, ain't it? Come on. God
[1:03:31] has been so good to us, ain't it?
[1:03:34] You know one thing about it? One thing
[1:03:35] about God, he calls us, don't he?
[1:03:38] Come on. And he can quit calling. He
[1:03:40] only obligated to call you one time.
[1:03:42] Come on. But what he is, he's
[1:03:43] longsuffering, ain't he?
[1:03:45] Come on. He's waiting on somebody to get
[1:03:47] ready, ain't it?
[1:03:48] He's waiting on because the devil, he
[1:03:50] want to he want to knock you out, but
[1:03:52] God is waiting on somebody to get
[1:03:54] prepared, right? The the word is going
[1:03:56] out. What it is? The word is going out.
[1:03:58] That's why he says you hear my word. Not
[1:04:00] only to hear it, but you got to do it,
[1:04:02] right?
[1:04:03] You got to live it. Come on. It'll be
[1:04:05] many people that heard the word. Come
[1:04:07] on. Many people that smoke in tongues.
[1:04:09] Many people that shouted, many people
[1:04:10] that did great works, right? But he
[1:04:13] said, "On that day I say, do what?
[1:04:15] Depart from you. Ye that work iniquity.
[1:04:17] I never what? Knew you." So you can't
[1:04:20] rest on the signs and the wonders,
[1:04:22] right? But what do they do? They follow
[1:04:24] those that believe. But what you got to
[1:04:26] rest in? Hallelujah. As I'm resting in
[1:04:29] the word of God. Hallelujah. That God,
[1:04:31] what you said, that's what I'm standing
[1:04:33] on. It might have hurt my flesh, but
[1:04:35] God, it might have got it might have
[1:04:36] wasn't what I wanted to do. Hallelujah.
[1:04:39] Might get went against what my will was.
[1:04:42] But I was willing to lay it down. Come
[1:04:44] on. Because I wanted your will.
[1:04:47] Is that what you want this morning?
[1:04:49] Come on now. Jesus showed us that.
[1:04:52] Come on. That when the storms come, he
[1:04:55] showed us how to weather the storm,
[1:04:57] right?
[1:04:58] Oh, Jesus. You know, I was praying. I
[1:05:01] was thinking about Jesus and and how
[1:05:03] when he was at his darkest hour. Come
[1:05:05] on. But Jesus was praying, wasn't he?
[1:05:08] And he was saying, "If it be possible,
[1:05:10] come on. This storm that's coming." Oh
[1:05:13] Jesus. The wind, the forecast, they
[1:05:16] telling me how bad it's going to be.
[1:05:19] Come on. It's going to be a car category
[1:05:21] five. Come on. A EF5 or whatever they
[1:05:25] call it. It's going to be a a 10 on the
[1:05:28] record scale. That's what they predict.
[1:05:31] And God, if it's your will, let this cup
[1:05:34] pass. Right. Come on. This storm, I
[1:05:37] don't know if I'm going to be able to
[1:05:38] bear it, right? But what did Jesus say?
[1:05:41] But Lord, not my what? Will, but let thy
[1:05:45] will be done. Right? Because if you put
[1:05:47] this storm on me, come on. Then I know
[1:05:50] that you'll give me strength to make it
[1:05:52] through it. Hallelujah. It might not
[1:05:54] look like nothing going to be left when
[1:05:56] it's over with. Oh Jesus. But the rock
[1:05:59] will still be there. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:06:01] Jesus. When it's all over, the rock
[1:06:04] still going to be there.
[1:06:06] Oh Jesus. And if you were anchored to
[1:06:08] the rock, oh God, come on. They say
[1:06:11] everything else shook, blowed all around
[1:06:14] you, but you were still standing. How
[1:06:15] were you still standing? Why do you
[1:06:18] still got peace? Don't you know
[1:06:20] everybody else has given up?
[1:06:23] Come on. Everybody else has walked away.
[1:06:26] People don't go to church no more.
[1:06:29] Come on. How are you still standing? Oh
[1:06:33] Jesus. Because I'm tied to the rock.
[1:06:36] Come on. I don't know. But it's
[1:06:38] something that keep holding me. Oh
[1:06:41] Jesus. Oh Lord Jesus. Come on. I would
[1:06:44] have let go long time ago. But the rock
[1:06:47] hallelujah. That I'm tied to. Oh Jesus.
[1:06:51] Wouldn't let me go. Aren't you glad for
[1:06:53] that this morning? Come on. Sometimes I
[1:06:55] don't know about you, but I think about
[1:06:57] some of the storms. Hallelujah. I think
[1:07:00] about some of the things that God has
[1:07:01] brought me through. Hallelujah. And then
[1:07:03] when you start going through, I said,
[1:07:05] "God, now no matter what, you brought me
[1:07:07] through this." Hallelujah. And you
[1:07:09] brought me through that. Come on. If you
[1:07:11] if I made it through all that, I know
[1:07:13] that you're able to keep me. I don't
[1:07:15] believe you brought me this far to leave
[1:07:17] me, God. So what may come tomorrow,
[1:07:20] I'mma hold on. I'mma hold out. I'mma
[1:07:24] wait on you. Come on. I said, "Are you
[1:07:26] waiting on God this morning?" Come on
[1:07:28] now. It's true. This is coming reality.
[1:07:32] Come on. This is coming reality.
[1:07:35] Come on. Some people make it through the
[1:07:37] the storm, the wind, and the rain, but
[1:07:39] they can't last the flood, right? Come
[1:07:42] on. Oh, Jesus. I want to ask you a
[1:07:44] question. You think God brought you this
[1:07:46] far to leave you?
[1:07:48] Come on.
[1:07:50] You think God brought you this far to
[1:07:51] leave you?
[1:07:53] Come on. I don't know about you, but I
[1:07:55] feel that I come too far to turn around
[1:07:57] now. Amen.
[1:07:58] Come on.
[1:07:59] After all the goodness that God has
[1:08:01] shown toward us
[1:08:02] and all the mercy and the kindness that
[1:08:05] God has showed towards us
[1:08:06] when we didn't even deserve it, right?
[1:08:09] Could have destroyed a long time ago.
[1:08:11] But his longsuffering, right? His mercy,
[1:08:13] his love, his see his love goes beyond
[1:08:16] what we can think.
[1:08:18] Beyond what man's mom and dad, his love
[1:08:21] goes way beyond that, don't it?
[1:08:23] Come on. His mercy stretches way beyond
[1:08:26] what we can think, right? But people
[1:08:29] don't understand. They think that God
[1:08:31] don't like them or something. Think that
[1:08:33] God hated them. Come on. Think that God
[1:08:36] won't hold something good from them.
[1:08:39] But if they only knew, hallelujah.
[1:08:41] In the midnight hour, if they only knew,
[1:08:44] come on. The protection that God has
[1:08:47] allowed it for them. Oh, they treat God
[1:08:49] a little bit different. How many believe
[1:08:50] that this morning? They shout the house
[1:08:52] down, wouldn't they? They'd always have
[1:08:54] a testimony, a song in their heart. Come
[1:08:57] on. Because God has opened their eyes to
[1:08:59] it. Amen. Somebody give the Lord a hand
[1:09:01] clap this morning. Oh Jesus. Come on. I
[1:09:04] said the storm. I asked the question
[1:09:06] this morning. I said, "Are you ready for
[1:09:08] the storm?" Come on. Are you ready for
[1:09:11] it? Come on. What a blessing it is to be
[1:09:15] prepared. Right.
[1:09:16] Come on. I've seen it. I said a lot of
[1:09:18] times people walk with God for a long
[1:09:20] time, but when major storm come, they
[1:09:22] don't know what to do. Right? Come on.
[1:09:25] Then they start doubting, don't they? I
[1:09:27] wonder is he real or not? Come on. Then
[1:09:30] they look back at their experiences and
[1:09:32] they start doubting their experiences,
[1:09:34] right? Come on. Because it looks like
[1:09:36] everything quiet, right? We call on God.
[1:09:38] Look like he didn't show up. Come on.
[1:09:40] But those storms are there to do what?
[1:09:42] Try you, ain't it?
[1:09:44] Come on. Each trial is doing something
[1:09:46] in your life, ain't it?
[1:09:47] Amen.
[1:09:47] He said, "I brought nothing in this
[1:09:49] world. Neither can I take nothing out."
[1:09:50] But you'll take one thing out and that's
[1:09:52] your character. Right? You'll be
[1:09:54] different than you was than when you
[1:09:55] came in. Right? When I came in, I might
[1:09:57] have been a weak little thing, right?
[1:09:59] Oh, God. Needed somebody to hold my
[1:10:01] hand. Might have been through been this
[1:10:03] kind of way that where I couldn't even
[1:10:05] do nothing without God, right? And I
[1:10:07] still can't do nothing without God. But
[1:10:09] the more that I grew, hallelujah, and
[1:10:11] the more that I've been through, then I
[1:10:13] start to realize, hallelujah, that my
[1:10:15] footsteps are ordered by the Lord,
[1:10:17] right? that whatever he takes me
[1:10:19] through, that's why the devil get mad
[1:10:21] with you. Hallelujah. Because no matter
[1:10:23] what, he can't take the smile off your
[1:10:24] face. He can't take the joy out your
[1:10:27] heart. Why? Because he didn't give it to
[1:10:28] you. Neither can he take it away. He
[1:10:30] might say, "I attacked their children. I
[1:10:32] attacked their family. I attacked their
[1:10:34] friends. I hit their health." But yet
[1:10:36] they still praising you.
[1:10:39] What's the secret? Hallelujah. Oh Jesus.
[1:10:42] Because of something down in your heart.
[1:10:44] Hallelujah. That long as that's still
[1:10:46] there. Hallelujah. That's the source of
[1:10:48] all my joy. That's the source of all my
[1:10:51] peace. That's why I'm still smiling.
[1:10:53] That's why I still can praise God.
[1:10:56] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on.
[1:10:59] Hallelujah. Come on. Oh Jesus. Come on.
[1:11:03] What you afraid for? Hallelujah. Come
[1:11:06] on. I can see David say, "I've been
[1:11:08] through the storm of the lion."
[1:11:09] Hallelujah. I've been through the storm
[1:11:11] of the bear. What y'all worried about?
[1:11:13] Come on. That's cuz y'all ain't been
[1:11:14] through no storms yet. Come on. But when
[1:11:16] you've been through the storm,
[1:11:17] hallelujah, when you can trust in God,
[1:11:20] because I looked at that situation and I
[1:11:22] said, "There's no way I should have made
[1:11:23] it out." Hallelujah. I look at that
[1:11:25] situation and I said, "That should
[1:11:27] situation should have destroyed me."
[1:11:29] Hallelujah. I shouldn't even been in a
[1:11:31] number. Come on. So, if God brought me
[1:11:34] through that, I'm confident. Hallelujah.
[1:11:38] I got faith in the God that I serve.
[1:11:41] Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. I don't need the
[1:11:44] sword and the spear. I don't need the
[1:11:47] shield in the buckler. Give me what I
[1:11:49] know that'll work. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus.
[1:11:52] Give me what I know that's proven every
[1:11:55] time. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on.
[1:11:58] That excites me this morning. Come on.
[1:12:01] To know what God is doing, right?
[1:12:04] Hallelujah. You know the the more I say
[1:12:06] the more that this this life is going on
[1:12:09] and the things hit you, you might start
[1:12:10] look like you're a little crazy, right?
[1:12:13] Because to the to the world, the logical
[1:12:16] things, right? They look at logical
[1:12:18] logic, right? This is logical, right?
[1:12:22] But the more that God does for you and
[1:12:24] I, we're not looking at logic. We're
[1:12:25] looking to the unseen.
[1:12:27] Come on. We looking to the things that
[1:12:29] we can't see. That's the things that I'm
[1:12:31] believing in. Right. But because God has
[1:12:34] has brought you into another place. Do
[1:12:35] you believe that this morning? Let's let
[1:12:37] the musicians come this morning. I
[1:12:39] didn't want to be long today. Y'all feel
[1:12:41] all right this morning. Come on. The
[1:12:43] storms are coming. Come on. You know,
[1:12:45] the other week I was sharing with them.
[1:12:47] I said the other week, you know, I was
[1:12:48] sitting in and laying in the bed and it
[1:12:51] woke me up. Thunder. Thunder hit. It was
[1:12:55] so loud. I thought it was earthquake
[1:12:57] like we've been having. Hit the house.
[1:13:00] Woke me up. But right after that, it was
[1:13:02] so quiet.
[1:13:04] It was like a eerie quiet.
[1:13:07] But then all of a sudden in the in the
[1:13:10] midst of all that irrequiredness, the
[1:13:12] wind started blowing. I I believe the
[1:13:14] weather man said it was 65 miles an
[1:13:16] hour. And I started thinking, Lord, what
[1:13:19] in the world is this, right? Cuz it
[1:13:21] happened so fast. But even in that, come
[1:13:24] on, I can start singing a little song to
[1:13:27] myself that my soul is anchored.
[1:13:29] Hallelujah. The winds might blow all
[1:13:31] that. Come on. I like that little verse
[1:13:33] we always say. And if the storm don't
[1:13:36] cease, right?
[1:13:37] And if the wind don't stop blowing,
[1:13:40] come on. I added a little part that I
[1:13:41] know that in the word of God, I got a
[1:13:43] hiding place.
[1:13:44] Come on. And it's going to keep me
[1:13:46] steadfast, unremovable. Right. In spite
[1:13:49] of the storm, see those things start
[1:13:50] becoming real to you. Right? But when
[1:13:53] when it ain't when it ain't really real
[1:13:55] to you, when those times come, you won't
[1:13:56] know what to do. Right? Come on. But
[1:13:59] when it's real to you, all of a sudden,
[1:14:01] the word of God comes to you, right?
[1:14:03] Come on. And then the scripture might
[1:14:05] come. The Lord is my strength. He is the
[1:14:07] light and my light and salvation. Come
[1:14:09] on. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[1:14:11] strength of my life. Whom shall I be
[1:14:12] afraid? When my enemies, even my foes
[1:14:15] came upon me, eat up my flesh, they
[1:14:17] stumbled and fell. Right? Come on. The
[1:14:20] word of God then starts encouraging you.
[1:14:22] Right? You start reading the scripture.
[1:14:24] You start the word start coming back to
[1:14:26] you. Scripture upon scripture and then
[1:14:28] you start understanding that God
[1:14:30] Hallelujah. He's real, right? We know
[1:14:34] he's real. He's still there. He never
[1:14:36] left you. Come on. And what it is, it's
[1:14:38] enough to keep you on. Mama might not
[1:14:41] know what you're talking about. Daddy,
[1:14:42] brother, sister, husband, wife might not
[1:14:44] know what you're talking about, but God
[1:14:46] is doing something in your soul.
[1:14:48] Hallelujah. Well, everybody in turmoil,
[1:14:50] God has brought a peace upon you, right?
[1:14:53] Come on. And that peace helps you to
[1:14:55] make it through. How many believe that
[1:14:56] this morning? How many has experienced
[1:14:58] that this morning?
[1:15:01] Amen.
[1:15:03] Hallelujah. I said, God is good, ain't
[1:15:05] he? Let us bow our heads in a word of
[1:15:07] prayer this morning. Jesus.
[1:15:12] Hallelujah.
[1:15:14] The storm.
[1:15:17] Come on. I said they coming so quick
[1:15:20] now.
[1:15:24] They come before you even got chance to
[1:15:26] think about it.
[1:15:30] But once you shake yourself, hallelujah,
[1:15:34] and you realize that ain't no storm,
[1:15:38] Hallelujah.
[1:15:40] Ain't no wind, no rain, no flood, no
[1:15:44] fire
[1:15:46] that can take you out
[1:15:51] because of how you was built.
[1:15:52] Hallelujah.
[1:15:54] It started with the word.
[1:15:58] Started with Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:16:01] And it's still him now.
[1:16:03] Come on. But if you ain't there,

[1:17:17] now.
[1:17:19] But give them faith, Lord.
[1:17:21] Faith to let go.

[1:18:30] Oh Jesus.
[1:18:32] Come on.
[1:18:34] If you want prayer, you can come this
[1:18:36] morning.
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:42] Amen.
[1:18:45] I said the storm is coming. Amen.
[1:18:48] Jesus said it would.
[1:18:50] Hallelujah.
[1:18:52] As our choir sings this morning, if you
[1:18:55] want prayer, you can come. Amen.
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:10] God
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:15] stand
[1:19:19] [Music]
[1:19:38] Thank you.
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:45] In Jesus name.
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:20:24] I pray
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:42] And sometimes it's hard to tell the
[1:20:47] night from day.
[1:20:53] Still that hope that lies with him
[1:20:58] is reassured.
[1:21:03] As I keep my eyes upon the distant
[1:21:09] shore, I know he'll lead me safely to a
[1:21:15] blessing place. He has prepared.
[1:21:23] Oh,
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:25] but if
[1:21:27] the storms
[1:21:30] don't cease
[1:21:33] and just in case the winds
[1:21:39] keep on blowing in my life,
[1:21:44] my soul
[1:21:47] has
[1:21:54] in the Lord.
[1:22:03] Oh,
[1:22:05] I realize
[1:22:08] that sometimes in this life,
[1:22:11] we're going to be tossed
[1:22:15] by the winds and the courage
[1:22:19] that seems so fear.
[1:22:22] Oh,
[1:22:24] but in the word
[1:22:27] of God,
[1:22:30] I got an anchor. Yes, I do. And it keeps
[1:22:34] me steady
[1:22:37] unable.
[1:22:44] [Applause]
[1:22:47] The stor
[1:22:50] see
[1:22:56] the wind
[1:22:59] keep on
[1:23:02] my
[1:23:14] in The Lord
[1:23:17] in the Lord.
[1:23:20] The Lord.
[1:23:22] Yeah.
[1:23:24] My soul's been an angel. My soul
[1:23:31] my my
[1:23:49] last
[1:23:50] you
[1:23:52] go of the
[1:23:56] in the sky. I love
[1:24:00] Jesus.
[1:24:02] My soul
[1:24:04] has been
[1:24:12] all
[1:24:21] my soul
[1:24:23] has been
[1:24:29] in
[1:24:31] in the Lord.
[1:24:39] Amen.
[1:24:41] My soul is anchored. Amen.
[1:24:44] When your soul is anchored, you can't be
[1:24:45] tossed. Amen.
[1:24:47] We were saying the other week, and I
[1:24:49] said it Friday night, said that while we
[1:24:52] worried about the storm, Jesus out there
[1:24:54] walking on it.
[1:24:55] Right. Right. Amen.
[1:24:58] He He's in the same wind and the waves
[1:25:00] toss and all that. But while we sitting
[1:25:02] there crying and word out for fear,
[1:25:05] I believe the Bible says they saw Jesus.
[1:25:08] They thought it was a spirit. He out
[1:25:09] there walking.
[1:25:10] Yeah.
[1:25:10] Just as calm. And you wonder sometimes
[1:25:13] we look at people why you're so calm,
[1:25:15] right? Because it's something about when
[1:25:17] Jesus on the inside, right? It might be
[1:25:20] tossing, torn. I'm going through the
[1:25:21] same storm, but one thing about it, I
[1:25:23] got peace in it. Why? because I know
[1:25:27] who's in me, right? And he's unsinkable.
[1:25:30] How many believe that this morning?
[1:25:31] Amen. Sister Sister uh I wanted sister
[1:25:35] Cheryl to sing that song. I'm blessed.
[1:25:37] Amen.
[1:25:40] Are y'all blessed this morning?
[1:25:42] In the middle of the storm. Are you
[1:25:43] blessed? Amen.
[1:25:45] Come on. Y'all feel all right this
[1:25:47] morning. You know I went real short. So
[1:25:50] we can probably sing for a little while.
[1:25:51] Amen.
[1:26:23] All I'm blessed.
[1:26:26] I'm
[1:26:28] blessed.
[1:26:30] I'm truly blessed. Truly blessed.
