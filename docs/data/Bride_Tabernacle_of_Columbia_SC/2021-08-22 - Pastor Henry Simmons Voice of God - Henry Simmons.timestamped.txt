[37:35] samuel ministered unto the lord
[37:38] before eli
[37:39] and the word of
[37:42] the lord was precious in those days
[37:45] there was no open vision too
[37:58] an error
[37:59] the lamp
[38:01] of god went out in the temple of the
[38:04] lord where the ark of god was and samuel
[38:08] was laid down to sleep for
[38:11] the lord
[38:16] and he ran into eli and said
[38:19] here am i
[38:21] for thou call it to me and he said i
[38:24] call
[38:25] not
[38:26] lie down again and when
[38:30] and and he went
[38:32] and lied down lay down 6.
[38:50] now samuel did not yet know the lord
[38:53] neither was the word of the lord yet
[38:56] revealed unto him 8.
[39:11] therefore eli said unto samuel go lie
[39:15] down and it shall be
[39:18] if he calleth thee
[39:20] that thou shall say speak lord
[39:23] and
[39:25] for thou servant here
[39:28] so samuel went
[39:31] and laid down in his place together and
[39:35] the lord came stood and called as yet
[39:39] other times samuel samuel then samuel
[39:42] answered speak for the servant of his
[39:46] may god bless you towards you may be
[39:48] seated
[39:51] the voice of god
[39:54] the voice of god
[39:56] many times god speak but
[40:00] we don't recognize it's him speaking
[40:04] god speaks through
[40:06] you know i was thinking you know
[40:10] sometimes god's voice is not perceived
[40:14] and i i looked at the
[40:16] the the the donkey
[40:19] balaam was riding
[40:22] the voice of god
[40:25] balaam was so intent on doing what he
[40:28] wanted to do
[40:32] that he ignored
[40:34] the voice of god he did not even
[40:35] recognize god was speaking
[40:40] now
[40:41] we
[40:42] he should have
[40:44] you know
[40:45] if all of a sudden
[40:47] the donkey that you're used to riding
[40:51] began to speak
[40:53] you can see how we could be so sad
[40:57] on our intent
[41:00] that we don't recognize that god is
[41:04] speaking when we're driven
[41:08] by our selfish desire
[41:10] and what we want
[41:14] when we're driven by that
[41:17] then when god is speaking sometimes we
[41:19] can't even hear god
[41:22] instead of
[41:23] listening and recognizing that was god
[41:26] speaking through the donkey
[41:28] in other words he wanted to punish the
[41:30] junkie for speaking
[41:32] and somebody comes to you
[41:36] and they said
[41:38] brother and sister you know unbeknown to
[41:41] you
[41:42] they may not have never known what you
[41:44] were intending to do what you were
[41:46] getting ready to embark upon what you
[41:49] were getting ready to go into but they
[41:52] come to you and they say such and such
[41:54] and such and such it
[41:56] and you said
[41:57] you said
[42:01] so many times it it has happened in my
[42:03] life and so many times it happened
[42:06] that
[42:07] god would pre-warn us
[42:10] and he'll tell us
[42:12] don't do this
[42:13] or don't do that
[42:15] but instead of us listening and
[42:17] recognizing it it's not that individual
[42:20] it wasn't a duncan it was god speaking
[42:23] the voice of god
[42:25] but we are so used intent like samuel
[42:28] here he was listening so
[42:31] he was so inspired by eli
[42:34] and he was so accustomed to eli speaking
[42:37] to
[42:38] when god was speaking he thought it was
[42:40] eli speaking you see how how you can be
[42:43] misunderstood
[42:44] you know sometimes it um
[42:46] it could be a the norm
[42:49] we can use
[42:50] used to the norm that when the
[42:52] supernatural begin to
[42:54] uh transpire because we're so used to
[42:56] the norm that when the supernatural
[42:58] begin to come in then we can still think
[43:02] hey hey this is a natural uh a voice
[43:06] calling me but it was a supernatural it
[43:08] was god
[43:09] speaking
[43:11] are you with me
[43:13] this is it's out of the norm god is
[43:15] speaking
[43:18] you know
[43:20] when a minister get behind this pulpit
[43:22] when he gets up to speak
[43:23] when a singer gets up to scene
[43:29] it ought to not be the
[43:30] individual
[43:32] because some people could receive
[43:33] directly
[43:35] from a song
[43:37] directly what they needed
[43:40] they needed to hear that song from god
[43:43] and it's not the you know that
[43:45] individual at that particular time god
[43:48] amen inspired them to sing a certain
[43:51] song
[43:53] they sometimes they are not conscious i
[43:55] i believe that duncan didn't even know
[43:57] what was going on
[44:01] and no doubt samuel was
[44:04] you know he wasn't in tune he didn't
[44:06] know what was going on
[44:08] but god was speaking to him without him
[44:12] having anything to do with it
[44:15] brother sis it's good that we can be
[44:18] used
[44:19] and not even know god is using us
[44:21] sometimes
[44:23] you know
[44:24] you know because sometimes if we knew
[44:26] god was using us sometimes we get a
[44:28] little lifted up
[44:31] you know i can do it god is using me no
[44:34] sometimes god uses us
[44:36] in in
[44:38] such a way
[44:39] that
[44:41] we are unconscious of that
[44:44] sometimes where down the road we
[44:45] recognize hey
[44:47] and somebody will come
[44:50] i've had people come up to me
[44:52] and they said you know
[44:56] god healed me
[44:57] years ago
[44:58] when
[44:59] you prayed for me so and so
[45:02] you know you didn't know that
[45:05] sometimes you've done something to force
[45:08] somebody said something in such a time
[45:10] when a person that at a stage of
[45:13] suicidal experience and all of that but
[45:16] you said something
[45:19] then the person would tell you later on
[45:21] i was at the brink
[45:24] i was just getting ready to take my
[45:25] whole life
[45:26] but
[45:28] you
[45:30] you came and you talked to me on time
[45:33] at the season when i needed it the most
[45:37] when i was getting ready to
[45:38] sometimes folks
[45:40] uh
[45:41] i want you to recognize i said god you
[45:43] know something
[45:45] i don't want to be able to stand here
[45:47] today
[45:48] and you
[45:50] hear
[45:51] that i got
[45:53] a message or something i said god
[45:56] say what you want to say
[46:00] for you know the needs of each and every
[46:03] individual
[46:05] you know what they're going through amen
[46:09] and you know what is needed to be said
[46:13] but if you listen and you hear
[46:16] uh brother simmons speak
[46:21] of minister simmons or bishop simmons or
[46:24] elder symbols or pastor simmons or
[46:26] whatever you want to call it you know
[46:28] but if you listen to that
[46:31] and
[46:32] but if it's something about beyond that
[46:36] behind the scene
[46:38] god is speaking directly to you
[46:42] because uh uh brother simmons does not
[46:45] know
[46:47] amen your situation in your present
[46:49] state
[46:50] of being
[46:52] amen and god can directly speak to you
[46:57] but
[46:58] samuel wasn't perceiving it
[47:01] he just thought
[47:03] it was eli
[47:04] he wasn't preceding
[47:08] and
[47:09] and that's what that
[47:12] is so often
[47:15] that
[47:16] when god is talking it's not preceded
[47:19] we don't know who it is
[47:21] so he like
[47:22] after the third time he says
[47:24] uh samuel
[47:27] i know
[47:28] eli recognized i know i'm not calling
[47:31] him
[47:32] in other words
[47:33] eli proceeded there was the lord talking
[47:35] to the young fellow
[47:37] he said now
[47:39] the next time
[47:40] when you lie down
[47:43] and you hear it again
[47:45] you say speak lord
[47:48] praise god
[47:49] wouldn't you like to have an experience
[47:51] that the lord would speak to you
[47:55] and you know that
[47:58] it's him that's speaking
[48:00] and he says speak lord
[48:04] and i said every individual must have a
[48:06] personal encounter with god
[48:10] without that personal
[48:12] encounter
[48:16] some amen
[48:20] eventually don't want that encounter but
[48:23] everybody wants
[48:25] something
[48:26] even though the deep call it to the deep
[48:29] down inside they're searching they're
[48:31] trying to find out
[48:34] amen
[48:35] my purpose for life
[48:40] where am i going where am i headed
[48:45] what am i trying to accomplish what am i
[48:47] trying to achieve
[48:51] praise god
[48:53] well who knows
[48:55] the path i take
[48:59] who knows
[49:00] my future
[49:04] here
[49:05] job said in job
[49:08] 33
[49:10] job 33
[49:13] and 14
[49:18] he said
[49:19] for god spake once yay twice
[49:22] yet man what
[49:25] oh let me read it again y'all got it now
[49:28] for god spake once yet twice yet man
[49:32] what
[49:33] perceives it not
[49:37] it's something about
[49:39] being able to perceive when god is
[49:41] speaking
[49:44] to understand
[49:46] that god is speaking to us
[49:49] it must come a time when the word of the
[49:51] lord is revealed like it was revealed to
[49:54] samuel
[49:55] god reveals himself to you personally as
[49:58] an individual it's got to come a time a
[50:00] junction in your life the junction you
[50:03] got to be a crossroad it's got to be a
[50:05] time that that junction come amen that
[50:07] you have to make a decision that
[50:14] and when that time he says and
[50:17] god speaks
[50:19] once and god speaks twice
[50:21] and we perceive it not
[50:24] it's time for us to
[50:26] start understanding who's speaking
[50:29] psalms 62 and 11.
[50:32] psalms 62 and 11.
[50:49] oh boy god is good amen
[50:56] he said god has spoken once twice
[50:59] have i heard this
[51:01] that what
[51:04] power what
[51:06] i'll tell you something
[51:08] you know what we you and i ain't
[51:11] you're gonna trust in your own power
[51:13] what kind of power do you have
[51:18] power blown it to god
[51:21] but he he says only god
[51:24] has spoken once
[51:26] so he's trying to get it over god spoke
[51:28] twice the power blown with the god
[51:33] what makes man
[51:34] so so lost
[51:39] it's pathetic
[51:44] it's pitiful that man don't know power
[51:46] belonged to god
[51:50] you don't have no power
[51:53] are you with me
[51:56] that's why jesus said without me you can
[51:58] do nothing
[52:02] you can't do
[52:04] what you think you
[52:06] you know so we trust in our own ability
[52:11] but power belongs to god you don't have
[52:14] no
[52:16] power you up man
[52:20] he said the power to be they are dying
[52:22] of god
[52:24] are you with me
[52:26] i don't care how
[52:28] how strong uh
[52:30] maybe the america russia
[52:32] or whatever power belonging to god
[52:37] i don't care if they got nuclear bomb i
[52:39] don't care they got whatever power
[52:41] belonging to god
[52:44] amen praise god
[52:47] all the might and all the ships and all
[52:50] the planes all of this all power
[52:53] belonging to god amen
[52:56] are you with me
[52:58] god speaks once he speaks twice and he
[53:00] lets you know the power of belonging to
[53:03] god you don't have no strength to do
[53:05] nothing
[53:09] you can't do nothing
[53:11] except god allows it if god don't allow
[53:15] you to get up in the morning you won't
[53:16] get up
[53:19] are you with me
[53:20] if god don't touch you
[53:22] oh god
[53:24] praise god
[53:26] power will blow me to god
[53:30] but
[53:31] balaam was so set
[53:33] in his own attitude in his own little
[53:36] or a way
[53:38] that
[53:40] he's not going to recognize god speaking
[53:46] now
[53:48] you know saint john how do i know god is
[53:50] speaking to me
[53:53] saint john 10
[53:55] how do i know god is speaking
[53:59] now
[54:01] the voice of god
[54:04] is expressed by the word of god
[54:11] the bible said by faith we understand
[54:13] that the worlds were framed by the word
[54:15] of god
[54:17] god said let there be light and there
[54:19] was light
[54:21] what was it god said it that was his
[54:24] voice speaking
[54:25] the word
[54:28] amen
[54:30] and when god speaks that's his voice
[54:34] amen
[54:35] then the word of god is the voice of god
[54:39] that speaks to you and i
[54:42] he says
[54:44] after these
[54:45] oh excuse me i'm looking
[54:47] at luke instead of john
[54:49] excuse me for a minute john 10
[54:55] and 1
[54:56] it says
[55:01] verily verily i say unto you
[55:04] he that enters not by the door into the
[55:07] sheepfold
[55:08] but climbing up some other way the same
[55:12] is a what
[55:16] i'm gonna tell you something jesus i'm
[55:18] the door
[55:19] isn't that right
[55:22] but see
[55:24] listen
[55:27] the voice of god listen to his
[55:32] voice now if you're going to try to get
[55:35] around jesus
[55:38] brother sister what's wrong
[55:43] because of greed and gain
[55:46] balaam didn't want to listen to god
[55:50] because he wanted promotion
[55:56] he didn't want to listen to god amen
[55:58] don't you know god puts up and god takes
[56:02] down promotion come from the lord
[56:06] all good and perfect gifts come from
[56:10] above
[56:12] are you with me
[56:15] power belongeth to the lord
[56:19] amen
[56:21] he says
[56:23] if you try to get in any other way
[56:24] you're thief in a robber
[56:30] he said but he that entered in
[56:33] by the door
[56:35] is the shepherd of the sheep
[56:38] to him the porter open
[56:41] the sheep what
[56:47] somebody say i'm not a sheep i'm a goat

[56:54] you've identified who you are
[56:58] and if you're a goat i i expect for you
[57:00] to act like a goat
[57:04] but he said the sheep
[57:07] are you with me
[57:09] they hear

[57:17] the sheep hear his voice
[57:20] and and he what
[57:22] he called his own sheep by what
[57:26] by name
[57:30] now god identifies that he's going to
[57:32] call you by your name

[57:44] hallelujah

[58:36] they need to know that somebody cares
[58:38] about them
[58:41] you don't even know how to take care of
[58:42] yourself
[58:44] i don't know
[58:46] the bible says we're not sufficient of
[58:48] ourselves and

[1:04:58] this morning who would you listen to
[1:05:01] praise god there must be a certain sound

[1:05:14] of chaos and confusion
[1:05:17] praise god god gives us peace

[1:05:31] amen praise god we don't stand still
[1:05:33] long enough

[1:05:38] we'll know who's speaking
[1:05:42] amen the devil makes you so busy and so
[1:05:45] caught up and so entangled with the
[1:05:47] characteristic
[1:05:48] life they admit that he don't let you
[1:05:51] settle down and and just listen
[1:05:54] amen you listen but at the same time
[1:05:57] you're moving and amen it's just like
[1:05:59] mom or dad or somebody trying to talk to
[1:06:02] you and you uh yeah yeah yeah but you
[1:06:04] got disc going on and that going on all
[1:06:07] kinds of things going on that you don't
[1:06:09] you're not still enough
[1:06:11] you got to get in a quiet place
[1:06:14] praise god get down and pray and get
[1:06:17] quiet before the lord amen and just say
[1:06:20] lord
[1:06:22] lead me
[1:06:24] guide me
[1:06:26] oh great jehovah
[1:06:28] amen lead me
[1:06:30] guide me

[1:06:34] well i don't want to make shipwrecks in
[1:06:36] my life
[1:06:37] god i don't want to go down the wrong
[1:06:39] path i don't want to lead myself i'll
[1:06:42] make a wreck
[1:06:44] i'll make a mess of my life but lord
[1:06:46] will you lead me
[1:06:49] will you guide me
[1:06:54] i believe that
[1:06:56] leadership is needed
[1:06:58] and i believe that the leader is here
[1:07:02] the one that said i'll lead you in god's
[1:07:04] into all truth
[1:07:06] knowing the voice
[1:07:08] of god
[1:07:11] knowing that he wants to lead you
[1:07:13] he wants to guard you
[1:07:18] as i was in prayer he says
[1:07:20] the reason why
[1:07:22] people are not hearing from god
[1:07:24] is because
[1:07:26] they won't be still
[1:07:31] the bible said they'll be running to and
[1:07:33] fro
[1:07:36] seeking
[1:07:38] searching
[1:07:41] but he said be still
[1:07:43] and know that i'm gone
[1:07:46] and i would be exalted
[1:07:49] are you with me
[1:07:54] can you see what's going on with your
[1:07:57] life
[1:07:58] with your present distressed what you're
[1:08:00] going through right now
[1:08:02] you want you want to hear from god you
[1:08:04] want god to speak
[1:08:06] but you don't
[1:08:08] have time to listen

[1:08:15] you want god to speak you want this
[1:08:18] personal encounter you want the you know
[1:08:22] you you want to know
[1:08:24] but the one that knows it all
[1:08:27] knows like he has the answers for your
[1:08:30] every question
[1:08:34] he would meet every one of your needs
[1:08:39] but you don't want to
[1:08:42] settle down
[1:08:44] settle down with all that you trying to
[1:08:46] achieve
[1:08:47] and say lord
[1:08:52] i can really
[1:08:55] i can really
[1:08:56] make a mess of my life
[1:09:00] but
[1:09:01] let me stop for a moment
[1:09:06] i don't know where you were when god
[1:09:09] just starts speaking to you
[1:09:11] always can look back
[1:09:14] and i can hear
[1:09:17] that voice begin to speak to me
[1:09:24] what if i didn't listen
[1:09:27] i knew what i was going to be
[1:09:29] there was no doubt in my mind if i
[1:09:31] didn't listen
[1:09:32] when i heard that voice
[1:09:34] because he showed me
[1:09:37] he showed me what was going to become of
[1:09:38] me
[1:09:40] and it wasn't good
[1:09:43] i had an opportunity
[1:09:45] to know that
[1:09:47] it wasn't me
[1:09:49] talking to myself
[1:09:52] it was god speaking to me
[1:09:57] whether i listen
[1:09:59] to god
[1:10:00] and take heed
[1:10:02] or go on
[1:10:06] i came to that time
[1:10:09] when i knew god was speaking
[1:10:12] and i could either just
[1:10:17] he just said the flashing red lights of
[1:10:19] his coming

[1:16:53] see john the baptist was doing
[1:16:56] what the word said would happen
