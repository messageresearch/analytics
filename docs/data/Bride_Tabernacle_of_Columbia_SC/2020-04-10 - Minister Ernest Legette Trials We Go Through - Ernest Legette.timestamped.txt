[26:00] thank you Lord Father for we love you in
[26:02] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[26:06] and amen
[26:08] we want to look at the book tonight
[26:10] Romans by God's grace Romans five and
[26:14] we'll begin at the first verse
[26:15] god is good there's a little something
[26:18] you know that the Lord has been putting
[26:22] into my heart and you know I just mean I
[26:24] guess everybody I've been talking to
[26:26] here lately I've been sharing a little
[26:28] bit of it with them you know that so I
[26:32] just pray that it'll be a blessing you
[26:33] know something just to give you faith
[26:36] for the time that we live amen seeing
[26:39] that we live in a treacherous time a
[26:41] time like Noah no other time you never
[26:46] would expected something like this you
[26:48] know that I was talking us so Jackson
[26:52] days says you know put the whole world
[26:54] on standby but sometimes God got to do
[26:57] that they got to put the whole world and
[26:59] stop stopping mode just to do what to
[27:02] get your attention now there's many that
[27:04] God even though he did that they still
[27:07] ain't gonna take the heat of God they
[27:09] gonna take all this precious time that
[27:11] God has given us like it says the Bible
[27:13] says we got to redeem the time for the
[27:16] days are evil well I believe God has
[27:18] given us time right now to redeem time
[27:20] that we can get along with God and and
[27:24] and you know I believe that he said in
[27:26] the scriptures come let us reason
[27:28] together saith the Lord come on God
[27:31] sometimes got to call us call us to a
[27:33] conference into a place where he wants
[27:36] to reason with us and top things over
[27:38] see what the present stage of your your
[27:41] ministry is precious days your life
[27:42] presence days your condition
[27:44] just where are we come sometimes God got
[27:47] to do that and to do that sometimes God
[27:49] we know hit what he did he had it takes
[27:51] sometimes people to the backside of the
[27:53] mountain to do that you know to get him
[27:56] away from all the other noise and all
[27:57] the other commotion of the land like I
[28:00] think about Moses he had to get him on
[28:01] the backside back there you know herding
[28:04] sheep and stuff just so he can get him
[28:06] alone to a place to where he can speak
[28:09] to him he can call him and say come on
[28:12] up come on I got something I want to
[28:14] talk to you about you know and that's
[28:16] what it is
[28:16] God does that finds finds ways I believe
[28:19] that to get us alone think about Paul he
[28:22] put him on the backside of the over in
[28:24] Arabia think about John the Baptist sent
[28:26] him out in the wilderness you know what
[28:29] it is God sending you and those
[28:30] sometimes those places the way he can
[28:32] have that one-on-one Communion and
[28:35] fellowship with you because he's got
[28:37] something he want to talk to you about
[28:39] I believe he told Abraham I'm gonna have
[28:42] I won't have from my server the things
[28:44] that I want to do and if we can sit down
[28:46] sometimes and and just meditate on the
[28:50] Lord you know sometimes God he want to
[28:53] show you some things he get into that
[28:56] place to where we seeking God we praying
[28:58] we are looking to him and then he can
[29:01] tell us sometimes or the things that's
[29:04] lying up ahead you know I believe that
[29:06] Paul said that these things they're
[29:08] gonna take you under where I say they're
[29:10] gonna take the world on the wherever
[29:11] certain things wouldn't gonna take us
[29:12] under where why because we've been in
[29:15] Christ and we know what's next we know
[29:17] what's coming next
[29:18] we might can't see it sometimes
[29:20] physically or no exactly but we know
[29:23] that right now is the time that we
[29:25] should be getting our house in order
[29:26] amen Romans 5 and by God's grace we're
[29:33] gonna start hitting the first verse and
[29:35] I read therefore being justified by
[29:38] faith we have peace with God through our
[29:42] Lord Jesus Christ God wants to give you
[29:45] peace tonight he says by whom also we
[29:47] have access by faith into the grace
[29:50] wherein we stand and and rejoice in hope
[29:54] of the glory of God and not only so but
[29:56] we glory in
[29:58] tribulations also knowing that
[30:00] tribulation worketh patience and
[30:03] patience experience and experience hope
[30:06] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[30:09] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[30:11] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[30:15] for when we were yet without strength in
[30:18] due time Christ died for the ungodly for
[30:22] scarcely for a righteous man will one
[30:25] die yet peradventure for a good man some
[30:28] would even dare to die but God
[30:31] commendeth his love toward us in that
[30:35] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[30:38] for us
[30:39] much more then being now justified by
[30:43] his blood we shall be saved from wrath
[30:46] through him for if we if when we were
[30:50] enemies we were reconciled to God by the
[30:53] death of his son much more being
[30:55] reconciled we shall be saved by his life
[30:59] and not only so but we also joy in God
[31:04] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[31:06] well whom we have now received the
[31:11] atonement may God had a blessed his
[31:13] reading of his word tonight by God's
[31:15] grace I just want a minister teeth for a
[31:18] moment and I entitled it the trials that
[31:22] we face amen the trials that we face and
[31:26] I said sometimes God what he does he he
[31:29] wants to get us to a place to where he
[31:32] can just commune with us and then he can
[31:35] bring us up up to speed you know God
[31:38] don't ever want to leave his people just
[31:40] out there lost without nothing I believe
[31:42] you know said that God don't never leave
[31:45] itself without a witness you know in the
[31:48] people they could be completely in sin
[31:49] and God can bring judgment on them but
[31:52] when they cry out to God God is still
[31:54] come down and and a lot of times he'll
[31:58] come down and still show them where they
[32:00] are and give them opportunity to be
[32:03] reconciled back to him and that's what
[32:05] we thank God for is that reconciliation
[32:08] that grace you know we always say that
[32:12] only difference between the the judgment
[32:14] scene in the mercy-seat is is blood when
[32:17] the blood is sprinkled on the judgment
[32:19] seat then it becomes mercy but when the
[32:22] blood is taken away from the judgment
[32:24] seat then that same seat that were the
[32:26] ones gave you mercy the blood is taken
[32:28] away and now it's gonna bring new
[32:29] judgment but we know that you know like
[32:31] I said while mercy is still available we
[32:34] want to obtain God's mercies but we're
[32:36] talking about you know it says the
[32:38] trials that you face you know it doesn't
[32:42] matter what condition or where you come
[32:45] from in life or how old you are how
[32:47] young you are
[32:48] you know while we here in this body
[32:50] we're gonna have trials and tribulations
[32:52] we're gonna have things in this life
[32:54] we're gonna have disappointments we're
[32:57] gonna have ups and downs we're gonna
[32:58] have times the way we just want to throw
[33:00] up our hands we're gonna have times the
[33:03] way you're gonna lay down and you're
[33:05] gonna want to die you gonna have times
[33:07] the way you're gonna ask yourself the
[33:09] question what is it all for you're gonna
[33:12] have times the way you just want to give
[33:14] up on life you want to give up on church
[33:16] you don't want to walk away but I said
[33:18] that it's something about it if you were
[33:20] just holding on to God just a little
[33:22] while longer then you would see that in
[33:25] all the trials and all the things that
[33:27] you've been through it wasn't nothing to
[33:29] be compared to the glory that God was
[33:31] gonna reveal in you or the things that
[33:34] God had in store for you I believe that
[33:37] that even the Bible says that weeping
[33:40] may endure for a night but joy is coming
[33:43] in the morning it seems hard sometime in
[33:46] that night but when the joy comes in the
[33:48] morning that sorrow sometimes don't even
[33:51] seem like it was even nothing you look
[33:53] back at those things and you you might
[33:56] laugh sometimes but when you were in
[33:58] that condition or in that stage it
[34:01] wasn't about laughing it might have been
[34:02] hurt it might have been pain but when
[34:04] you indoors when you made it through it
[34:07] and then you look back and you see just
[34:11] how good god is when you realize that
[34:14] God keeps all his promises then he took
[34:18] all of my enemies and he drowned them in
[34:20] the sea I could think about Israel and
[34:22] when they were in Egypt and how when
[34:25] they were in
[34:26] bondage it was hard it was wrong the
[34:29] Bible says that they cried out because
[34:32] of the reason of bondage and they
[34:33] taskmasters but we nee and when they
[34:35] made it on the other side of the Red Sea
[34:38] they cried again but it was a different
[34:40] crime it was a cry appraises it was a
[34:44] cry I believe the Bible says that Moses
[34:47] sang a new song I believe that the Bible
[34:49] says that Miriam took the tambourine and
[34:51] the women went behind her and they were
[34:53] praising and shouting God but now just a
[34:56] few days ago
[34:57] and they didn't have that shout they
[34:59] didn't have that dance but God came
[35:02] through for him and I think that I said
[35:04] that's what happens if we can only
[35:06] endure what we're going through right
[35:08] now we can only endure that what the
[35:11] world has been hid the world has been
[35:14] struck in the world is shaking in fear
[35:16] but I want to say tonight that the Bible
[35:19] says fear not little flock but it's the
[35:22] father's pleasure to give you the
[35:24] kingdom when the world is fear and I
[35:26] don't want you to fear but I want you to
[35:28] have faith and that's what it is I like
[35:31] how
[35:31] here you know Paul we bleed right out of
[35:35] the book he spins he was saying you know
[35:37] he was saying that therefore being
[35:40] justified by faith we have peace with
[35:43] God through the Lord Jesus Christ I
[35:46] don't know about you but being justified
[35:48] through faith we got peace tonight you
[35:52] know peace is something hard to come
[35:54] about come around the day because why
[35:56] everybody's got something they worried
[35:58] about worried about the job worried
[36:01] about their or their family worried
[36:03] about their health worried about the
[36:04] peas and the robbers breaking through
[36:06] the steel but I want to say to you
[36:08] tonight if you got faith in Jesus then
[36:11] you got peace peace they say like a
[36:14] river peace days that not that I give
[36:17] you a que no man give you and no man
[36:19] can't take it away I want to say you
[36:22] know we're looking at the trials that we
[36:24] face but I like how it says in the
[36:27] second verse by whom you talking about
[36:29] Jesus Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we
[36:32] have access by faith into this grace to
[36:36] where we stand
[36:37] you know I was praying the other day
[36:40] and I said you know it I said Lord I
[36:43] said we don't always understand what's
[36:45] taking place you know your Christian
[36:48] journey is built on faith
[36:50] the foundation is gonna be faith you
[36:53] stepped out on faith and whatever you
[36:55] had you walked away from it you believed
[36:58] from the beginning that God was gonna
[37:00] keep you that God was gonna do what he
[37:03] said he was gonna do and if you have
[37:05] faith to step out then building it is
[37:07] guard that's saying god I want to say it
[37:10] has guard change has he lost his power
[37:12] or is he still that same God when you
[37:15] step out on faith from the beginning and
[37:17] God kept you hallelujah when you
[37:20] couldn't see your way before you and you
[37:22] stepped out God building the road as
[37:24] you're going down I believe that with
[37:26] all of my heart stepping out in air but
[37:29] God building the pathway he didn't let's
[37:31] just sit but you stepped out anyway and
[37:34] just as God is did that now he's saying
[37:36] I'm still that same God if you would
[37:39] display that same faith god I don't know
[37:41] where we gone I don't know where this is
[37:44] taking us to but I know one thing that
[37:47] God you promise that you'll never leave
[37:49] us nor forsake us you never left me then
[37:52] you ain't gonna leave me now God just
[37:54] still here and I'm stepping out on faith
[37:56] I'm still walking hallelujah I believe
[38:00] that but we find that what we says I
[38:02] believe I like that how Paul says we got
[38:05] access by faith into this grace that we
[38:08] stand we stand in the night by grace we
[38:11] kept by grace you know I was thinking I
[38:13] said that we don't you know we don't
[38:15] always understand what's taking place
[38:17] you know or why God allow things to
[38:20] happen
[38:20] no I'm minister one time on what God
[38:23] allows sometimes God say God want to let
[38:26] that law help them to his children God
[38:28] allow certain things to happen and we
[38:30] don't understand why God allowed to
[38:31] happen
[38:32] and God don't have to explain himself
[38:34] but God has got a purpose and all that
[38:37] he does you know I think about I think
[38:39] about the scriptures and it says that
[38:41] you know how perfect God is and we're
[38:44] going to say who can he be compared to
[38:46] God can't be compared to nobody he
[38:49] exceeds everyone even the one you think
[38:51] over is great it is a great
[38:54] statue guard exceeds him just leaving
[38:56] that more God one that you think God
[38:58] that's good God exceeds him even higher
[39:01] than that one that you think there's
[39:03] rich God exceeds him even in rich God
[39:06] it's easy
[39:07] he is uncompelled you can't compare God
[39:10] to nobody
[39:11] God you know he's the greatest there
[39:14] ever was I believe that they sang a song
[39:17] he's the highest he's hired and highest
[39:19] and he's greater than the greatest come
[39:22] on he's the King of Kings that he's the
[39:24] Lord of lords he's the undisputed the
[39:27] heavyweight champion I know I got it all
[39:30] mixed up but he's granted in the song
[39:32] he's greater than we can describe him
[39:34] God is greater than s hallelujah that's
[39:36] the God that we serve and nobody can
[39:39] take away from him nobody can add to him
[39:42] nobody can take away from him you know
[39:44] the devil is confused
[39:46] Sharyl somebody today I said you know
[39:48] what when we win this thing shall pass
[39:51] and we can all be able to come back
[39:53] together again and worship the Lord I
[39:55] said we ought to be stronger than we
[39:56] ever been why because now is the time
[39:59] you ought to be building up such a
[40:01] communion in a relationship with God I
[40:03] said the devil gonna be confused why
[40:06] because he look away he took away to the
[40:08] church they look like the people should
[40:09] have got weak but they came out stronger
[40:12] why because they got a revelation that
[40:14] no matter where they were they still was
[40:18] able to praise God no matter where they
[40:20] were God was still able to be reached
[40:22] hallelujah God could still be touched
[40:25] they didn't have to be in a building
[40:27] made by hands but there was somewhere
[40:29] and they could always reach God I
[40:31] believe that how many believed is come
[40:33] on I want to invite you I said I don't
[40:35] know about you but recently I've been
[40:37] praying like I ain't never prayed before
[40:39] I've been commuting and seeking and
[40:41] talking to God like I never had I said
[40:43] with all this time on your hands what
[40:45] you gonna do now come on you're just
[40:47] gonna waste the time are you gonna
[40:48] redeem it I said I'm gonna redeem the
[40:50] time imma start catching up on all that
[40:52] missed prayer time all that missing time
[40:55] that didn't have why I said I don't know
[40:57] about you but I'm getting stronger you
[40:59] know when the devil told Pauling's I
[41:02] mean I the devil but they told Paul and
[41:04] Silas in prison setting them being their
[41:06] whining and complaining word about
[41:07] how they gonna get out of it I believe
[41:09] the Bible said they started singing and
[41:11] praising God
[41:12] they started clapping and having Church
[41:14] in the jailhouse in so much that an
[41:16] angel came down
[41:18] hallelujah shook the place and I believe
[41:20] God is still dispatching angels right
[41:23] now if your prayers can get right if you
[41:25] can praise God right he still can send
[41:27] down angels today to do what shake the
[41:30] place hallelujah
[41:32] shake your body out of that pain you're
[41:34] going through shake your mind how did
[41:36] that trouble you're going through I
[41:38] believe God is still that same God
[41:40] that's what it is
[41:41] we call him God on the scene you know I
[41:45] like how like how I believe was Gideon
[41:47] he said if God be God we're all this
[41:49] miracle said we want a guard miracles we
[41:52] want to go out of power if God be God
[41:55] where's all his miracles and I believe
[41:57] that God still got miracles I would say
[42:00] we don't say a bag of miracles cuz he
[42:02] ain't like a magician with a bag of
[42:04] tricks god no it ain't that the bag like
[42:06] that that's just who he is
[42:08] amen but we find that we says you know
[42:11] or the trials that we face
[42:13] you know I said Lord you know spraying
[42:16] the other day I said I'm not asking you
[42:18] why but I'm asking you for the Grace and
[42:22] for the patience you'll make it through
[42:25] it because I said oh no I said God when
[42:29] it's all over we don't we'll cry when
[42:32] it's all over
[42:33] beginning to praying we don't shout the
[42:35] victory we gonna dance we're gonna sing
[42:37] we gonna pray as we're doing it now but
[42:40] when it's all over
[42:41] come on it ain't nothing like traveling
[42:43] over the enemy's feet ahead I mean it
[42:46] ain't nothing like when your enemies is
[42:47] drowned cast into the sea what it is we
[42:50] got to realize I said God ain't asking
[42:52] you why I said cuz I don't understand I
[42:56] don't see the role before you for me I'm
[42:58] just asking you for the grace and for
[43:00] the patients come on don't make it
[43:03] through it and I believe that that you
[43:06] know sometimes you know I says that you
[43:10] know got our approach to God I said so
[43:12] many times it means a lot it means a
[43:14] whole lot I approach to God you know I
[43:16] think about Solomon and God asked him
[43:19] once before what did he want
[43:21] you know he could ask for the money he
[43:22] could ask for this and that but he said
[43:23] lord I want wisdom and history just like
[43:27] his approach his heart was right
[43:29] and God said since you could ask me
[43:31] anything and I too gave it to you
[43:32] but since that's what you asked for not
[43:34] only I'm gonna give you that but I'm
[43:36] gonna give you everything else to go
[43:37] along with it and I said God that's what
[43:40] it is
[43:40] we're not asking God to take us out of
[43:42] the trial we're not asking God did not
[43:45] let us go through now come on
[43:47] but we're asking God for the grace in
[43:49] the patience that makes it through it
[43:51] and I believe that if we ask God in the
[43:54] right way God would give us what it
[43:56] takes then Durer I would share with
[43:58] somebody I says the race is not given to
[44:01] the strength not as strong but it's
[44:03] given to those that ache endure come on
[44:05] the ones that can last
[44:07] God wants some God most people that are
[44:09] last Saturday they battle-tested they
[44:12] they they they come on it's something
[44:14] about those battle-tested veterans the
[44:16] ones that straight out of boot camp and
[44:18] they get out on the battlefield ain't
[44:19] been battle tested when the bullets
[44:21] beginning to fly in their running they
[44:23] hide they don't know they shell-shocked
[44:24] come on I think about it shared like
[44:27] this it was a wound on soldier he was
[44:30] saying how this is our general another
[44:33] general butter officer in World War two
[44:36] and and how he just came out of school
[44:39] and they put him in them in the
[44:40] battlefield and they were going in the
[44:41] heat of the battle and he say he he
[44:43] began to tell the soldiers when the
[44:45] bullets beginning to fly in it if you
[44:47] start running the first one that runs
[44:49] I'm a shooter in these in these guys
[44:52] that he was talking to her privates but
[44:54] they don't been through some battles
[44:55] they had been into some Wars and some
[44:57] storms they don't been through some
[44:59] trials now and they know what the battle
[45:01] was like so when they got on the
[45:02] battlefield they said the first thing
[45:05] they'll hit from a mortar round and
[45:08] killed a radio man killed his first
[45:11] sergeant all right before his eyes and
[45:13] he said he got so shell-shocked that he
[45:16] couldn't move they had to take him by
[45:17] his hands and lead him off the
[45:19] battlefield
[45:19] why because he was never battle tested
[45:22] school couldn't prepare him for reality
[45:25] school could prepare him for when the
[45:27] bombs begin to fall and that's what it
[45:30] is right now we need some battle tested
[45:32] Christians we
[45:33] some Christians that not only read and
[45:35] they know it intellectually but they've
[45:37] been through the storm they been through
[45:39] the rain hallelujah
[45:41] and when times come like this they know
[45:43] what they know what to do when the devil
[45:45] beginning is dropping bombs and throwing
[45:47] all kind of fiery darts you ain't have
[45:49] to lead them out the battlefield but
[45:51] they don't stand there gallows
[45:53] they gonna put up the shield of faith
[45:54] they gonna realize who-who been keeping
[45:58] them in all those battles before and
[46:00] they're gonna let nothing stop them what
[46:02] they going through now come on God is
[46:04] getting you battle ready don't you know
[46:06] the battle is coming this ain't nothing
[46:07] compared to I was sharing somebody I was
[46:11] saying that they was talking about you
[46:12] know Jesus said that well when these
[46:14] things happen he says that you know the
[46:16] sign the wars and the rumors of war
[46:18] think it was Matthew 24 and he was
[46:19] saying when Sir that they asked him a
[46:21] question when shall these things be and
[46:23] what shall be the sign of that coming in
[46:26] the Sinai and asked him questions and he
[46:28] began to tell him he began to say oh
[46:30] you'll see this happened you'll see that
[46:32] happen he said to be pestilence
[46:33] earthquakes from diverse places you know
[46:35] I think about you know all those things
[46:37] like that we did I have this he said he
[46:39] said but all of these are just the
[46:40] beginning of Sorrows come on I say you
[46:44] think you've been through something I
[46:45] said something you said all of these are
[46:47] just the beginning of it come on so if
[46:49] this is just the beginning and we can't
[46:51] even make it through just a little what
[46:53] we're going through now how you gonna be
[46:54] understanding what's coming up the road
[46:55] come on but we know that before the
[46:58] battle get too hot and before we get to
[47:00] our breaking point I believe God to come
[47:02] back and get us how many believe that
[47:04] but we find that we talk about you know
[47:06] the trials that we faced I says that you
[47:09] know I ask God for the grace and the
[47:11] patience that you know I said no matter
[47:13] you know what we face God has a plan
[47:16] come on God has a plan in it no matter
[47:19] what we face no matter how negative it
[47:22] look God got a plan in it no matter how
[47:25] bad it'll God got a plan in God got
[47:27] something he's working out you you don't
[47:30] understand it and we can go through the
[47:31] scriptures but for the sake of time I'm
[47:33] just gonna have to skip over a lot
[47:34] because I had a lot of things I wanted
[47:36] to go but we could critique them but I
[47:39] just want to just get the gist a sermon
[47:40] come on
[47:41] I says that you know it might look bad I
[47:44] says but what we do
[47:47] no matter what we face we got to change
[47:49] our thinking God got a plan in it come
[47:52] on I wasn't one of the one characters I
[47:55] wanted to look at it was Joel and I said
[47:58] is that some people say God would let
[47:59] his children go through that but but
[48:01] what did God let Joe go through come on
[48:03] you know the Bible says Joe job we know
[48:06] he was a righteous man he was one that
[48:08] feared God he was one that tried to live
[48:10] the best that he could have I believe
[48:12] the best I know how the way in so much
[48:14] that God even has Satan and Satan said
[48:16] he going to and fro the earth seeking I
[48:18] mean saying God began to tell them he
[48:20] says have you tried my survey Joe come
[48:22] on
[48:23] they ain't none more righteous and him
[48:24] than all the earth come on you say why
[48:26] would God put his own child in a place
[48:28] like that God wouldn't do us like that
[48:30] come on now he did job like that didn't
[48:32] he and he didn't even tell job that's
[48:34] what he was doing
[48:35] come on but that's what he did and I
[48:38] said that's what happens a lot of times
[48:40] we look at it Oh God
[48:42] it's not that are you going through it
[48:44] just because you're saying all that but
[48:45] it could be because God trying to get
[48:47] some glory out of it come on now we know
[48:49] that you know we still check our lives
[48:51] daily and we still you know make sure
[48:53] that we're right with God but even
[48:55] anybody but in all the things that we go
[48:58] through we got to change the way we
[49:00] looking at like we say that situation
[49:02] you know I think about it I says you
[49:04] know a job he didn't question the God
[49:06] God the Bible says that in all those
[49:09] things they lost all the trouble that he
[49:11] had go through you could go you can just
[49:13] read just read the book of Job you get a
[49:14] chance all the things that he had to
[49:16] suffer and then when it looked like that
[49:18] should have been enough it still was
[49:20] piling up on them it still was hitting
[49:22] them hard look like when that should
[49:23] have been enough then it still was
[49:25] hitting them hard but what it was Joel
[49:27] maintained this integrity no matter what
[49:30] he stayed God I believe because Joel
[49:32] mine was conditioning that he wasn't
[49:35] looking at these things in the way that
[49:37] we look at him a lot of times but Joel
[49:39] you know one of the things he said he
[49:42] said the Lord give and he take away
[49:43] blessed be the name of the Lord
[49:45] don't you know everything you got it's
[49:47] only because God blessed you with it the
[49:49] things that we can obtain and achieve I
[49:51] was praying the other day I said Lord
[49:54] with just a one wave of your hand
[49:56] not even that with just one gesture you
[49:58] can wipe out all that I am
[50:00] I said God with just one gesture I said
[50:03] I'm only living the way I can live I'm
[50:05] only blessed the way I'm blessed is
[50:07] because of all that you're doing for me
[50:09] not only did you come and die I said
[50:12] Lord you don't do nothing else that was
[50:14] enough but you did more than you decay
[50:16] man die I said God will each and every
[50:18] day he's still blessing me you still
[50:20] giving me undeserved blessings and I
[50:23] said guard I looked at like that I said
[50:26] Lord I'm so glad that you're lovely I
[50:28] said because god I realized that just
[50:31] the one wave with your hand I can be
[50:32] nothing I could lose my mind
[50:34] I don't even you you can take the breath
[50:37] of life right there just as a gesture
[50:38] just cut you off I said but God you've
[50:40] given me one more day I said God you
[50:42] blessed us to be family one more night
[50:45] Lord I said God you open so many doors
[50:47] you made so many ways I might I couldn't
[50:50] see what you've been doing and I said
[50:52] Lord I'm not even even worried about
[50:54] that in that way I one thing I'm gonna
[50:56] do is just praise God you don't have to
[50:59] prove to me Lord God how much you love
[51:01] me I know you love me because when I was
[51:03] resting and undone when I was unfit not
[51:06] worthy to even be called a child of God
[51:09] you still call me by your name
[51:11] hallelujah
[51:12] how many glad God called him by his name
[51:14] I thank the Lord for that I said you
[51:17] know Joey we didn't question my says you
[51:20] know but what happened I said God God
[51:24] used Joe to prove to Satan that he had a
[51:27] man that would trust him no matter what
[51:29] come on God wanted to prove to Satan
[51:33] Satan didn't believe him did he you know
[51:36] he only worship for you because of this
[51:38] he said come on I got a man that no
[51:43] matter what he don't serve me and I know
[51:46] it because God knew what was in JoVE
[51:48] heart I said it was proven time for job
[51:51] and hos are saved even tonight it ain't
[51:54] proven time for you God want to see
[51:57] whether you gonna stay with him or not
[51:58] God want to see whether you gonna hold
[52:01] on to the world whether you going door
[52:04] to tonight whether you battle-tested as
[52:07] you say you are come on or whether we
[52:09] gonna have to lead you off the
[52:10] battlefield come on
[52:12] I pray that we don't have to leave
[52:14] the battlefield but I pray we can join
[52:16] hands and pray huh come on and build up
[52:18] such a wall that the devil can't get
[52:20] through there how many believe that oh
[52:22] we thank the Lord I said the trials that
[52:25] we faced I said just as it was a proven
[52:27] time then you know you know we look at
[52:31] certain things that we face and I said
[52:34] God you know whose estate is an
[52:36] approving time now because what God does
[52:38] dard God is he's the master builder
[52:42] come on the orders of builder you know
[52:45] he he was trained in carpentry come on
[52:48] God is a master builder come on
[52:51] so when he's working on us he know what
[52:53] he doing it might not look like nothing
[52:55] coming out of it you know you know I
[52:57] believe a true a carpenter or a
[53:01] sculpture of something or real artists
[53:03] they can look at something don't mean
[53:05] nothing but what they see in what other
[53:07] people that ain't got that gift they
[53:09] can't see what they see they see
[53:11] potential in it but everybody else that
[53:13] don't even gift it like that they don't
[53:15] see that potential but that artist he
[53:17] can look at it on our sculpture or that
[53:19] master builder he said oh we could work
[53:21] with that
[53:21] come on Oh glory to God but everybody
[53:25] else came I said you know God is the
[53:27] master builder he's the master artist
[53:29] he's the master painter or whatever you
[53:33] want to call him he definitely he's the
[53:34] master in it come on that when nobody
[53:36] they say it's fun it's unsalvageable
[53:39] come on
[53:40] God say no it ain't unsalvageable I'd
[53:42] know how to rock a restore it I got
[53:44] faith that I believe that when I'm done
[53:47] with it it'll be all right it'll be a
[53:49] place where I can go and live in
[53:51] hallelujah how many believe that but the
[53:53] walls are falling down the foundation
[53:55] ain't right god said but when I get
[53:57] doing with it come on I'll be able to go
[53:59] and live in it how many how many want
[54:01] God did the work on them guarding on
[54:04] going no house that's that the roof
[54:05] falling me and come on that might fall
[54:07] down on him but a foundation gonna give
[54:09] away on the mother war the storm I
[54:11] believe it I believe it says that when
[54:13] the window when the storms calm it's
[54:15] going try you can say what you got your
[54:17] house built on but when it storms the
[54:18] trials come it's gonna try it
[54:20] every man work the Bible say gonna be
[54:22] proved we gonna see what the house made
[54:24] out of then come on but I said god I
[54:27] what you too bill don't be long Lord
[54:29] work homes and that's what it is
[54:31] God let us say he's the master builder
[54:33] come on he's building things huh he's
[54:36] working on us bringing us true you know
[54:39] faith and in knowledge you know
[54:41] brotherly kind of you know we go about
[54:42] the pyramid I just you know go that way
[54:45] but I said you know God is building on
[54:47] us come on because he wants to bring the
[54:50] head to the body come on
[54:51] capstone the love because he can't just
[54:54] rest anywhere so God is building us come
[54:56] on he's the master builder he's doing
[54:59] something in us come on that's way it
[55:01] says he we know that the trials of our
[55:03] faith come on it's working patience come
[55:05] on God is building something on your God
[55:08] is working on you God is building you up
[55:11] to just something because he's the
[55:13] master builder but I says that once we
[55:16] understand that what God is doing then
[55:19] we're not sitting in stalemate
[55:21] come on but we moving when everybody
[55:24] else ain't moving you know we're still
[55:26] moving on in God come on
[55:28] I believe that we say the theme for this
[55:30] year was gonna be let's go home and they
[55:33] say you know they've shut the church
[55:34] down come on but I said you know what we
[55:36] still going on and that shouldn't stop
[55:39] your progress you know we ain't gonna
[55:41] stop moving because we can't assemble
[55:43] together but we gonna run with a heart
[55:46] we're still moving come on why because
[55:48] we're still united in the spirit come on
[55:51] we still in heavenly places in Christ
[55:53] Jesus we still in tune with one another
[55:56] why because all those that are in Christ
[55:58] are like-minded and God it goes hard
[56:01] from you what he intending to do God is
[56:03] still pouring out fresh revelation down
[56:06] in your soul hallelujah when everybody
[56:09] else is starving when they you're wrong
[56:11] rather than scraps God's got something
[56:13] held in reserve just for this moment
[56:16] hallelujah and I believe that I say God
[56:19] I want what you got in reserve Lord God
[56:21] I won't it Lord oh I don't have to be
[56:24] out there gathering scraps my father I
[56:26] don't have to eat out of that come on he
[56:28] says my father's got more than enough
[56:30] I'm going back to my father's house I
[56:32] don't know about you but I'm going back
[56:33] they were saying your father I'm going
[56:35] back to the throne how down in prayer
[56:38] down on my knees hallelujah and I
[56:40] believe God go
[56:41] something deep down on the inside come
[56:44] on I believe that with all of my heart
[56:46] God is inviting us come on in I believe
[56:50] God is is inviting us right now come on
[56:53] come on to that place where I can
[56:55] commune which you know I won't have a
[56:57] relationship which I was sharing with
[57:00] someone the other day I said you know
[57:02] the thing about it is I says love is a
[57:05] funny thing I say I said sometimes I say
[57:10] I mean wife joking around we said you
[57:13] know we fell in love with each other but
[57:14] we didn't really know what love was it
[57:17] was love but I said love got a different
[57:20] meaning now did it did it come on I said
[57:23] especially when children came and then
[57:25] trials hit and I said is that the more
[57:27] we go we go through and the more that we
[57:30] face and make it out of it that's the
[57:31] more we love one another that's the more
[57:33] of a relationship in a barn we got why
[57:35] because we don't being through some
[57:37] things together we don't have the whole
[57:39] each other up in the midnight hour
[57:40] several times I said and the longer we
[57:43] stay together there was a time I said
[57:46] that you know you just you just thought
[57:47] you couldn't live without her but then
[57:49] it comes on placing the relationship
[57:51] that you realize I can't live without
[57:53] her come on
[57:54] why because she's a part of me it's not
[57:57] just that it was a lust thing but I
[57:59] realized this she was a part of me
[58:02] come on and so I said if I would go a
[58:04] day without talking to her I feel I'd
[58:08] feel something wrong I'd feel like some
[58:10] part of me was missing especially if I
[58:12] was go to three days a week without
[58:15] talking to my wife I said that it would
[58:17] be like a Hilton is something missing
[58:19] and I said just as I have that
[58:22] relationship with my wife in that way I
[58:24] says that I that you have that you
[58:26] should have that relationship with God
[58:28] that same way come on that the longer
[58:31] you saved and you stay with God come on
[58:33] I said is that you build in such a
[58:35] relationship with him we say he done
[58:38] busted through this come on he done
[58:39] bought you through that come on
[58:41] and now you know it was a point it was a
[58:43] time you know that God he said he'd
[58:45] rather die for you come on and now you
[58:48] cut me cutting beginning to love him in
[58:50] such a way that you won't you've got the
[58:52] little for him come on and I say is that
[58:54] you know
[58:55] to go with our days without talking to
[58:58] God
[58:58] something about to be missing you ought
[59:00] to feel that something is missing I
[59:02] believe that when we don't have that
[59:04] fellowship in that communion with God
[59:06] God he needs that fellowship in that
[59:09] communion with you why because you are
[59:11] part of him you you you are ill I would
[59:16] say you are completing him he came and
[59:18] died for you that we can be as be his
[59:21] wife come on the make up who he is
[59:24] and I says that that's what it is that's
[59:26] the kind of love and the relationship
[59:28] and I'm gonna have to close the night
[59:29] and we ain't even got started on the
[59:32] tribulation come on and the things that
[59:34] you go through but I says that you know
[59:36] I want you to just be encouraged I says
[59:40] you know the Bible says that you know
[59:42] that tribulation it worketh patience and
[59:45] pacing experience come on God it's
[59:47] building you building you taking you to
[59:50] come on it's working I like how it says
[59:52] the first thing tribulation work is
[59:54] patience that's the first thing God
[59:57] working outpaces come on in you that you
[1:00:00] can learn how do we don't know you can
[1:00:03] learn I believe that how to how to trust
[1:00:07] God in all in all circumstances God is
[1:00:12] working that out come on because you
[1:00:14] know I believe the Bible says let
[1:00:16] patience have it's perfect work that you
[1:00:18] might be perfect you know you say you
[1:00:20] want to be perfect well patience is
[1:00:22] gonna protect you you know to a person
[1:00:24] that day can wait on God that has the
[1:00:27] patience to wait on God and ain't in no
[1:00:29] rush because they know that God keeps
[1:00:32] all his promises and no matter what they
[1:00:34] gonna they gonna do whatever God asked
[1:00:36] them and they gonna be faithful to God
[1:00:37] that person is a perfect person
[1:00:39] why because nothing changed shake them I
[1:00:42] believe Joel said though he slay me yet
[1:00:44] I'm still trust all all these things the
[1:00:48] skin worms all these things eating my
[1:00:50] fleece said no the skin worms eat my
[1:00:51] flesh dog got balls he says he was still
[1:00:54] convinced they said I know my Redeemer
[1:00:56] liveth and I got patience no way don't
[1:00:58] know come on but what it does
[1:01:00] tribulation working patience pacing
[1:01:02] experience come on it's bringing you
[1:01:05] through an experience hope come on
[1:01:07] we find that what is
[1:01:08] are doing bringing us I believe that
[1:01:11] from from phase to phase I was saying I
[1:01:14] says that's what God does he puts us
[1:01:17] into a place God always does that now
[1:01:20] close here
[1:01:20] he puts dust God always puts us in
[1:01:24] situations the way we we have no other
[1:01:26] choice but to have faith in Him
[1:01:29] well we have no other choice but to draw
[1:01:31] from him I think about you know since I
[1:01:34] used to sing a song there's a cool well
[1:01:36] of water springing up in me come on
[1:01:38] Jesus is that water I think about Jesus
[1:01:41] how he met the woman that in the will
[1:01:43] and and he began to talk to her about
[1:01:45] her coming to draw come on
[1:01:47] he says you you coming here to the well
[1:01:49] to draw and but he says but you know I
[1:01:53] got water come on
[1:01:54] he had something that he wanted you draw
[1:01:58] from him
[1:01:59] come on he talked about that water that
[1:02:02] when somebody draw that water and once
[1:02:04] they get a drink or net he said you're
[1:02:06] never thirst again come on in so in a
[1:02:08] way that he is saying come on that
[1:02:10] everlasting fountain and that's what
[1:02:13] people they they never some times we as
[1:02:17] individuals never get that personal
[1:02:19] relationship
[1:02:20] we never get that that personal
[1:02:22] experience they're going in I believe to
[1:02:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:26] they understand come once you come to
[1:02:28] that place and you learn then because
[1:02:30] when the teacher comes he says he gonna
[1:02:32] teach you all things when he comes in
[1:02:34] and then you learn why he's teaching you
[1:02:37] that I want I want you to I can explain
[1:02:40] it like this you know I was thinking
[1:02:42] about the the little girl Helen Helen
[1:02:45] Keller she was born deaf and dumb and
[1:02:47] all and I said dad you know it was only
[1:02:49] one person that could teach her and I
[1:02:53] think now her name is Anne Sullivan but
[1:02:55] she could she could take her and teach
[1:02:58] her how to function in a world that she
[1:03:00] didn't have no knowledge of that she
[1:03:02] couldn't see that she couldn't hear but
[1:03:05] Anne Sullivan could had what had a gift
[1:03:08] to teach her how to function in that
[1:03:10] world and I said what it is when you're
[1:03:12] born again come on you've been
[1:03:14] translated out of this world
[1:03:16] into the kingdom of God to where you no
[1:03:19] longer live by your five sisters but you
[1:03:21] live by faith
[1:03:22] in that world you you in a world of
[1:03:25] faith you can't see it you can feel it
[1:03:27] you have even no knowledge or means
[1:03:30] scientific places they even place it
[1:03:33] there come on
[1:03:34] but faith tells you it's there now how
[1:03:36] you gonna operate in that world without
[1:03:37] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has to be
[1:03:40] your teacher
[1:03:41] it takes you by the hands hallelujah and
[1:03:44] it might not be an overnight thing but
[1:03:47] he takes just about of him and he begins
[1:03:49] to show us how to operate in that world
[1:03:51] to way we come to that place to a it's
[1:03:55] just like second nature you don't you
[1:03:58] can't explain how you can't explain how
[1:04:01] you just no you just get up and just
[1:04:02] walk like that but it was just second
[1:04:04] nature then it becomes second nature to
[1:04:06] you even in the fit in the face room Ted
[1:04:09] knap took that no matter when situations
[1:04:10] arise you immediately reach out into the
[1:04:13] hand of faith why because the Holy Ghost
[1:04:15] has taught you how to how to adapt into
[1:04:21] the world you live in in that in that
[1:04:22] world the Holy Ghost has has translated
[1:04:25] he brought you to that place to where
[1:04:27] you know you're not governed by these
[1:04:29] things but you already tapped into that
[1:04:32] another dimension it's HAP inter that
[1:04:34] place to where God is that's why nothing
[1:04:36] can faze you living in another world and
[1:04:39] I believe that I said God is that what
[1:04:41] you're doing even to us right now
[1:04:43] ulong's that happened that the medical
[1:04:45] field you know we thank God for the
[1:04:47] doctors and the nurses but we say a lot
[1:04:49] of times they've been exposed
[1:04:51] why because things hit they have known
[1:04:53] they panic and they don't know what to
[1:04:55] do come on they don't know which way to
[1:04:57] turn they trying to spare China and
[1:04:58] hoping that the things might work and we
[1:05:01] thank God even for all of their efforts
[1:05:03] but it's something about it what does
[1:05:05] God do sometimes puts us in the corner
[1:05:08] the way we can have no other choice but
[1:05:09] to say God you know you've exhausted
[1:05:11] everything else oh come on God he is the
[1:05:16] S he is the one he go he said come on I
[1:05:19] want to show you how to operate I want
[1:05:22] to show you how to enter into those
[1:05:24] things that the world know nothing about
[1:05:25] I want to show you things in the world
[1:05:28] that man can't see only the Holy Ghost
[1:05:31] will be able to bring out of your spirit
[1:05:33] about Revelation that you can look in
[1:05:36] word and see where you are the time that
[1:05:38] you're living in you might look at your
[1:05:40] brother or your sister next to you say
[1:05:42] brother sister can't you see it but they
[1:05:44] can't see why because they hadn't gone
[1:05:46] through that teaching that training that
[1:05:48] Holy Ghost took you through but God
[1:05:52] takes us through that how many thankful
[1:05:54] for that tonight a man is mr. Simmons

[1:07:17] God tonight that he met the trials that
[1:07:21] we go through I got up about three
[1:07:23] o'clock this morning and I was just
[1:07:27] praying and writing and listening to a
[1:07:31] precious brother Ernie shed it says that
[1:07:37] here tonight he's talking about
[1:07:41] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:07:45] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:07:47] Jesus Christ I've been listening to the
[1:07:52] president as he talked about virus and
[1:07:56] all and one thing I noticed lately that
[1:08:02] everybody seems to start talking about
[1:08:04] God he's talking about Easter
[1:08:08] I hadn't heard the president curse'
[1:08:12] lately

[1:08:39] down amen
[1:08:41] everybody recognize that we need help
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:08:46] that somebody that's higher than you and
[1:08:49] I as we go through this trial the world
[1:08:53] it's going through as our minister they
[1:08:56] get saying the world is going to their
[1:09:00] tests and their trial and as a world go
[1:09:04] through the stress and trial and as we
[1:09:07] go through testers and trials he meant
[1:09:11] it takes God that bring us out
[1:09:13] victoriously somebody told me about a
[1:09:18] song and it must have came in my spirit
[1:09:21] some kind of way and all I thought about
[1:09:26] this morning as I was writing the the
[1:09:31] man in the mirror
[1:09:34] and I thought about what James was
[1:09:39] saying concerning the man in the mirror
[1:09:43] he said in James Warren he said were
[1:09:47] four lay apart all filthiness and
[1:09:49] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[1:09:52] with meekness the engrafted word which
[1:09:55] is able to save your soul but eat but be
[1:10:05] doers of the word and not hearers only
[1:10:10] he says here deceiving your own self
[1:10:15] how can a man deceive his own
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:20] I believe we have so many people that
[1:10:25] are hears of the word and not doers of
[1:10:28] the word and because they hear the word
[1:10:32] they shout that dance and they clap
[1:10:35] their hands and they say man but when it
[1:10:41] comes down to doing they don't do it
[1:10:45] those folks that do that kind of thing
[1:10:50] they deceive their own self they're not
[1:10:55] deceiving the preacher they're not
[1:10:57] receiving God but they deceiving their
[1:11:00] own self so don't you get a word about
[1:11:06] the hypocrites they deceive in their own
[1:11:10] self he says here for if any be a hearer
[1:11:17] of the word and not a doer he is like
[1:11:22] unto a man beholding his natural face in
[1:11:26] a glass I said the man in the mirror he
[1:11:32] sees himself in a glass for he beholdeth
[1:11:37] himself and goeth his way and
[1:11:41] straightway forgetteth what manner of
[1:11:45] man he was he forgot what manner of man
[1:11:50] he was and then he says here but whoso
[1:11:55] looketh into the perfect law of Liberty
[1:11:59] praise God
[1:12:02] the perfect law of Liberty I heard mr.
[1:12:05] Leggett talk about faith amen
[1:12:09] the perfect law of Liberty and continues
[1:12:17] day in he is not you've got to continue
[1:12:22] in that perfect law of Liberty the Bible
[1:12:28] tells us the man is not justified by the
[1:12:30] law in the sight of God but by faith are
[1:12:34] you up there
[1:12:35] and when you look into the perfect law
[1:12:38] of Liberty and when you're looking at
[1:12:41] them in the mirror they meant and you're
[1:12:43] looking in the mirror
[1:12:45] I wonder who or what do you see when you
[1:12:48] look in the mirror I think that many
[1:12:52] people they men they're looking with
[1:12:56] their their natural eyes but they have
[1:13:00] no spiritual sight to understand that
[1:13:04] God they meant when you're looking at
[1:13:08] mirror you are not to see yourself you
[1:13:14] are to look in the mirror and see a
[1:13:16] reflection of him that liveth in you and
[1:13:22] that ought to be Jesus Christ you said I
[1:13:26] want to see Jesus t-this when I look in
[1:13:31] the mirror I want to see Jesus now we
[1:13:35] don't want to just look we want to see
[1:13:39] the word we want to see the word
[1:13:42] manifested in our lives we want to see
[1:13:46] Jesus Christ living in me when you look
[1:13:51] in the mirror don't look at yourself I
[1:13:54] believe many folks look in the mirror
[1:13:57] and it faces me this morning I tell
[1:14:02] these special little boys sometimes my
[1:14:07] son said this is my daughter where
[1:14:09] you're going get you're all dressed up

[1:14:20] and put them in comb your head and you
[1:14:25] know look like you're going somewhere

[1:14:36] old-timers I want to say amen go dig in

[1:15:44] devil's workshop

[1:15:49] and do something let's get on our knees

[1:16:05] want to go
[1:16:08] the man in the mirror amen
[1:16:13] what what do you see when you look at in
[1:16:17] the mirror in the mirror that we're
[1:16:20] talking about is the Word of God they
[1:16:26] meant and you look into the Word of God
[1:16:30] then the word that's in you in the word
[1:16:35] that you're looking at muscle they meant
[1:16:38] that sin you should reflect what's in
[1:16:41] the Bible
[1:16:43] Jesus was a word and he said such the
[1:16:49] Scriptures for in them you think you
[1:16:51] have eternal life but they are they they
[1:16:53] testify of me he understood what the
[1:16:58] word said he would do and then he said
[1:17:01] now I want you to know I'm doing what
