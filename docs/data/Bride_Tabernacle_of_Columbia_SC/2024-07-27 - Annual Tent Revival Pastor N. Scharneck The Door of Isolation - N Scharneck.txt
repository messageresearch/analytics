amen I wish I had time to praise God wish I had time to let all the ministers say something but we don't have that kind of time but we thank God for again all the Ministers of the gospel and all the pastors we going to ask you to stand again tonight we thank God for them praise God we appreciate their support and appreciate all of you that come from far and near just to be with us amen amen and one more time the brothers from the foreign field brother from Uganda brother Samuel amen and brother Keith Reed amen thank God for them brother Nicholas shanet from South Africa will be sharing with us tonight but before he comes forth we're going to ask it's it's a Revival taking place over in yuganda you hear about two 300 getting baptized at one time in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I told him just to give us a brief testimony so Brother Sam going to come and give us a brief testimony of what God is doing in Uganda let's receive brother Samuel from [Applause] Uganda God bless you all bless I want to see Hands Up amen uh I just want to take this privilege to greet all of you again in that mighty name of our Lord Jesus Christ a name that's above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ uh I thank God for the grace that he has given us and especially uh to shine upon us am that we come to know the message of the hour I believe that's the greatest thing because the Bible says God wants all people to get saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth amen because there are many who are saved but they don't have not come the knowledge of the truth and we know Jesus said is the way the truth and the life amen and uh just before I just give a testimony I feel that I should just give a greeting and uh maybe you shall just read one scripture as I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is uh John chapter 15 ah the Bible says I am the vine I'm the True Vine and my father is the the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he PES it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine nor more can ye except you abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me he can do nothing if a man abide in me he is if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if he abide in me and my words abide in you he shall ask whatsoever you will and it shall be done unto you here in is my father uh glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples amen I believe that's the purpose of these tent meetings is for us to bear fruit and the fruits that the Bible is talking about here I believe not the fruits of First Corinthians but this is bringing more Christians to the Lord yes sir because if the life of the Lord Jesus Christ is in you according to the Bible then you will bear much fruit it does not mean only that by preaching but the life when the life of Jesus is in you whether you are not preaching yeah but your life will be able to Bear fruits that is to see that it will bring more people to Christ and any branch according to scripture that does not bear any fruit it that the Life of Christ is not in that person because if the Life of Christ is in you he is abiding in you then the Life of Christ will bear fruits because you are the branch I am the branch amen so the purpose of Christ being in US is to bring forth much fruit and the Bible says that's when the father is glorified when you bring forth much fruit amen so my brother my sister God wants you to bring forth much fruit otherwise you'll be Barren and if you are Barren the Bible says you should be cut off and cast in the fire so many any Christians claim to be Christians Hallelujah claim to be Believers but they are not abiding in the branch meaning that they are not bringing forth any fruit and if you are Barren then you should be Cast Away oh my I just want to say something small here before I give my testimony says here in the message a blessing Prophet I know God's program is written out here in the Bible and I'm ashamed of myself as a minister of the Gospel 1 million Souls won I ought to have 10 million Souls won I am a way behind what about you how many Souls you want since you've been in Christ Christianity is just goes from one to another bearing fruit no so how many Souls you want since you've been a Christian if you are not winning Souls you are guilty you are barren you have brought shame on the church and the gospel how many people you get out for Wednesday night prayer meetings if you are not doing it you are you ought to be ashamed of yourself before Christ you are guilty and your place is at the altar I I invite you to come with me for repentance amen amen so ask yourself my Brother since you became a Christian how many Souls have you WN to Christ if not then you are baren you should be a branch to be cut off amen oh God may God help us and the purpose of these meetings is for us to bring souls to Christ and wherever you are as a Christian whether you are working whether you are a woman whatever you are your purpose is to bring somebody to Christ is that right God bless you I just give my small testimony I believe it was in 2016 um i' had gone to Zimbabwe for a missionary work and had traveled for about 4 days from Uganda in a bus and took about 4 days because cross from Uganda to Kenya from Kenya to Zambia from Zambia then you go to Zimbabwe so I took about 4 days and around 10: in the evening I was resting tired is when I heard a voice calling me Samuel Samuel you have gone to many countries preaching this gospel what about your people go back to your people and preach to them this gospel amen and when I went back home because the place where I am pastoring is not my birthplace I think brother kith is knows about because he has been visiting us so when I went back home then I felt a burden of going back home to my people my birthplace amen and when I went I was invited to preach in one of the Anglican churches which to them they said it is me who started at church before I came to the place where I am right now when I was still in Pentecost so it's just a young boy of about 15 years who told me Pastor you go back to Busia that's the place I Stay come back next week you'll be the one to preach in that church so when I went I came back to Bia and I went back I think after one or two weeks and I was given the chance to preach there was a reverend with a caller and other ministers but they told them today there is a vistor is going to preach amen and I just took one scripture from chapter 1 Timothy 2:3 this is good and acceptable in the sight of God who wants all men to get saved and to come the know of the truth and from that scripture I continue all up to baptism and one brother said pastor you go back to theia when you come back you'll baptize me and after I went back I baptized four people and the church started from there Lord amen and God gave us Grace we bought land and we also build a church brother kith has been there I think twice now and from that church we have already started other three more churches in that [Applause] place amen and know people are being baptized every week every month even when I was here they baptized some people last Sunday amen so people are coming to the Lord amen the Revival is going on on and on many people are coming to the Lord amen and I believe when brother Cas was there amen many people he ministered to amen now it is my prayer amen that you continue praying for the work in Uganda I'm speaking mostly about my area that is Eastern Uganda amen and uh I would say this that God really needs to help us because many many ministers amen they are struggling to preach the gospel but they don't even have support amen sir most of them even don't have bicycles I think brother kith is a witness not even a bicycle in our meetings we have very many meetings like this but may not even have one m one vehicle but here you have vehicles everywhere amen amen but we are struggling to bring in souls to the kingdom in any way possible yes sir so we are asking for your prayers amen that God May touch you in any way I believe prayers is more important if God would touch some of these ministers amen amen instead of them paying tithe to one another they should pay tithe to some of those poor ministers so that the work of God may continue God bless [Applause] you appreciate it we don't know how blessed we are until we go on the foreign field we don't even know anybody in America that we know that's really poor until you go on the foreign field and once you see poverty I was in Africa and a family with the grandma and all of them in a little that's bigest this pull pit right here and they had a curtain maybe a little bit wider and a a raggedy like crocos sack to pull down to separate the husband in white from the rest the floor is dirt and you can look around and you got hundreds hundreds of houses just like that connected to one another people walk for miles in the pouring down rain walking for Miles with babies on their side backs coming to church and when they get there what did they do sat down brother car on do they sat down what they stand practic no back com the chair [Music] you got a v they sat down the whole time no they stand up practically the whole service they standing on their feet praise the Lord amen amen you can't stand for one [Music] song praise God what a shame amen right what a shame in Jamaica I look with some of the minister to stay I said but key feel so bad makes you feel bad I said brother in his family thing huh that little shed back there is much larger than the place that the family stay in I'm not trying to get on your sympathy Bo brother Brooks come up and give us a song and receive the speaker ton night uh brother Nicholas shanet and brother rookie give us a song don't don't don't don't get pitiful but be thankful that God has bless you next time you eat a meal be thankful [Music] this is very uh in a time where we should be uh most serious we see all of the things that are happening around the world things that are happening in the churches and I think we ought to be able to give thanks unto the Lord so we're not going to sing nothing fast but we're just going to sing a song that hopefully it'll touch your heart how can I say thanks for the things youve done for me things so undeserved yet you gave to prove your love to me the voice say of a million Angels cannot exp my

for William Brenham in every verse of scripture that's not what the message taught us the message taught us to look to Christ look for Christ and ver of scripture you know what that's caus it's caus two absolutes ain't no such thing is two absolutes brother Henry there's only one absolute and that's Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah you know brother bam when he preached the absolutes he actually said there was about five or six different absolutes Hall he said a vision from God is an absolute he said the written word of God is an absolute the Holy Ghost both is an absolute but when I study it all you know what I found out it all it all ties into the Holy Spirit see if it comes from the holy spirit it's the absolute and I believe my salvation came from the Holy Spirit I've got an absolute in my soul I believe God hears my prayers Hallelujah I believe God hears my prayers why cuz I'm single-minded I ain't got two things on my mind I got one thing on my mind and I know he loves me
