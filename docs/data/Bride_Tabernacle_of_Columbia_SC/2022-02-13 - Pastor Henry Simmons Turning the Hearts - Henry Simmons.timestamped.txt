[38:20] the vision of all is become unto you as
[38:24] words
[38:25] of a book that is sealed
[38:28] which men deliver to one that is learned
[38:31] saying
[38:32] read this i pray thee
[38:34] and he said i cannot for it is sealed
[38:38] 12.
[38:48] together
[38:49] wherefore the lord said for as much as
[38:53] this people draw near me with their
[38:55] mouth
[38:56] and with their lips to honor me
[38:59] but remove their
[39:01] hearts far from me
[39:03] and their fear towards me is taught by
[39:06] the precept of men
[39:08] may god bless the readers where did you
[39:10] be seated
[39:16] the
[39:17] book of modical 4
[39:23] last book in the old testament modica 4.
[39:29] and 5.
[39:33] i was talking this you know i
[39:36] was just praying and
[39:38] there was several things came to my mind
[39:42] it's time to return it's time to come
[39:45] back to god
[39:49] turning point is
[39:52] just too much
[39:55] turning point
[39:58] and um but we were talking about turning
[40:00] the hearts
[40:02] and hopefully we'll it'll be a little
[40:04] bit of everything
[40:05] it says behold uh four and five
[40:10] behold i will send you elijah the
[40:13] prophet
[40:16] be behold i will send you elijah the
[40:18] prophets before
[40:20] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[40:22] of the lord
[40:24] the way
[40:25] russia is mounting up over there and the
[40:28] way things are looking
[40:29] look like we're nearing the end
[40:33] because
[40:34] if we
[40:36] we know it was three walls the first
[40:38] wall second woe in the book of
[40:40] revelation third war first world war
[40:43] second world war the third war
[40:46] it just talked about three world wars
[40:50] and we are near that great and dreadful
[40:52] day
[40:53] then they talk about the battle of
[40:55] armageddon which is the last battle
[40:59] and we realized that
[41:01] we're nearing
[41:02] a time where
[41:04] everything is getting red tents the
[41:06] world is getting tense
[41:09] and um
[41:10] if the wall break out
[41:12] we don't know
[41:14] what kind of world we're gonna have
[41:16] in the next few days
[41:18] if
[41:21] russia goes into lithuania
[41:24] and this is not politics we're not
[41:25] bringing that but i just want you to be
[41:27] aware
[41:29] amen
[41:30] if you're not right regard it's time to
[41:32] do something about your condition
[41:35] because we don't know how much time we
[41:37] got here
[41:40] it says
[41:41] the great and dreadful day it's a time
[41:43] coming we call the great tribulation
[41:45] period
[41:48] and that's a time nobody
[41:50] if you
[41:52] understand what's going to happen you
[41:54] don't want to be around here
[41:58] if you think it's chaotic now
[42:01] it's gonna really be chaotic
[42:04] if you're around left behind
[42:06] but we know the church goes up
[42:10] and god turns away from the gentiles
[42:13] and god start
[42:15] stealing with the jews
[42:18] and they come back and they start
[42:20] serving the lord
[42:22] 144 000
[42:25] jews over in israel
[42:29] so when the jews recognized jesus christ
[42:32] as savior which they rejected him
[42:35] but they were blind for our satan
[42:39] god blind them for our sake
[42:42] but
[42:43] once they start seeing again
[42:46] then god gives them two prophets like
[42:48] unto moses and elijah
[42:52] and the jews start receiving the lord
[42:56] you all
[42:56] know the spirit of god lifts up off of
[43:00] the gentiles
[43:02] the other nations
[43:04] so by the grace of god
[43:07] the bible said only he did not let will
[43:09] let until he be taken out of the way
[43:12] the only thing holding the devil back
[43:14] from just
[43:15] total the
[43:17] trying to destroy and just kill and just
[43:20] right here
[43:21] have it
[43:23] is
[43:24] that god still has his holy spirit in
[43:26] the land
[43:28] but when the spirit of god lifts up out
[43:30] of here
[43:31] you know the bible tells us in
[43:33] revelation 12
[43:34] that satan come down because he knows
[43:36] his health but a short time
[43:40] he's no more the bible said
[43:42] the accuser of the brother is cast down
[43:45] the devil accuses you before god
[43:48] but it's going to come a time when
[43:51] he's cast down into the earth with a
[43:53] short time
[43:55] before he's
[43:57] thrown in the bottomless pit
[43:59] bound there for a thousand years
[44:02] are you with me
[44:03] so we're out of time period
[44:07] amen
[44:08] where things could happen
[44:11] overnight
[44:13] things could just you can wake up in the
[44:15] morning
[44:18] they use the expression
[44:20] and all hell is let loose
[44:24] it's just another world
[44:26] just like we woke up one morning then
[44:28] the whole world was shut down almost
[44:31] because of the coronavirus
[44:35] we can wake up in the morning and
[44:38] it's just
[44:41] totally chaos walls
[44:45] america
[44:47] england all the countries
[44:50] going into battle
[44:53] brother and sister what with all this
[44:55] nuclear power and all of this
[44:58] just what would happen
[45:00] if something like that happens
[45:03] brother listen the great and dreadful
[45:05] day
[45:08] and then he says
[45:10] and he
[45:11] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[45:13] the children and hodge the children to
[45:16] the fathers at least i come and smite
[45:17] the earth with the curse
[45:21] and god gives a period of time
[45:25] that
[45:26] the hearts
[45:28] of the children might be turned to the
[45:30] fathers as he gave a period of time
[45:33] before the jews
[45:35] went into their
[45:37] dark period of history
[45:39] before titus army came and destroyed
[45:42] jerusalem
[45:45] god gave a little period of john the
[45:47] baptist coming on the scene
[45:49] to turn the children hearts
[45:52] and turn the father's hearts to the
[45:54] children
[45:56] are you with me
[45:58] so god gives us a period of time to turn
[46:01] the children heart back to the apostolic
[46:03] fathers
[46:04] are you with me
[46:06] so here and uh
[46:08] turn into hearts
[46:09] luke 1 and 17.
[46:12] maybe i want you to see
[46:14] what we're saying
[46:16] the hearts turning our hearts
[46:19] talking to you you're not
[46:22] he says
[46:23] concerning john the baptist
[46:26] he says
[46:29] in the 16th verse and many of the
[46:31] children of elders shall be turned to
[46:33] the lord their god
[46:37] luke 1 16 and many of the children of
[46:40] israel shall be turned to the lord their
[46:42] god
[46:44] see the children were illegal supposedly
[46:45] men already serving the lord
[46:48] they were god's chosen people isn't that
[46:50] right
[46:52] but somehow
[46:53] their hearts still needed to be turned
[46:56] and folks go to church and say we're all
[46:59] christians why should our hearts be
[47:00] turned
[47:01] out
[47:03] we all go to church we all believe in
[47:04] jesus
[47:06] and the jews felt like we all serve
[47:09] the god of abraham and ours and jacob
[47:12] we all in other words
[47:14] how you gonna turn us to what
[47:17] we got it and you know that's the way
[47:20] the church world feels like it's today
[47:22] we already got we christians we already
[47:24] say we got it
[47:26] so they felt like they were safe and
[47:28] secure
[47:30] not knowing
[47:32] what had happened to them
[47:34] they were more into tradition
[47:36] than they were into god
[47:39] are you with me
[47:41] he said in vain you do worship me
[47:45] teaching for doctrine the commandment of
[47:47] man
[47:48] see they went more into vain worship
[47:51] that wasn't into true worship anymore
[47:54] brother and sister
[47:56] and that's what happens you know he said
[47:58] in the 17th verse and he should go
[48:01] before
[48:02] him in the spirit
[48:04] and power of their lives to turn the
[48:07] hearts
[48:08] of the fathers to the what
[48:10] children notice that monaco said
[48:13] and the hearts
[48:15] of the children to the fathers
[48:18] notice he only dealt with one part of
[48:20] this verse
[48:22] the elijah of that time which is john
[48:24] the baptist she turned the hearts
[48:27] of the fathers
[48:28] to
[48:29] children
[48:31] amen
[48:32] jesus said except you come as a little
[48:34] child you ain't nobody asking it in
[48:37] amen
[48:39] but
[48:40] because they thought
[48:43] they didn't need him
[48:44] they didn't want him
[48:47] and see some folks think they don't need
[48:49] god
[48:50] so they don't want god
[48:53] amen
[48:55] you can never force god on somebody to
[48:57] think they already got it
[49:01] but when i talk about turning the hearts
[49:03] see
[49:05] saul of tasha which was paul he had to
[49:08] be churned
[49:10] he meant because he thought that he was
[49:12] saved and that he was worshiping god in
[49:16] the truth
[49:18] amen but on his way to the masters to
[49:21] persecute
[49:22] the church of god
[49:24] a light shine from heaven he said
[49:27] who you lord you know
[49:29] the one that he's supposed to be in
[49:30] worship he supposed to know who he was
[49:32] he said who are you lord the lord said
[49:34] i'm jesus
[49:36] whom you persecuted we knew this
[49:37] persecuting god's people god said you
[49:39] persecuted me
[49:42] are you with me
[49:44] and he recognized from that time
[49:47] from that time
[49:49] amen his heart was turned
[49:53] turning the hearts
[49:55] you know you must come to a turning
[49:57] point in your life
[50:00] it's a place you got to meet god just
[50:02] like he met god that day
[50:05] and if you met god somewhere along that
[50:07] line then you know that turning point
[50:10] amen that time when you met god
[50:13] and it caused you to turn
[50:16] amen
[50:18] so here
[50:20] he says
[50:21] the hearts of the fathers to the
[50:24] children and the disobedient to the
[50:28] wisdom of the jest
[50:31] amen we all in some time
[50:35] past with disobedient children in that
[50:37] right
[50:39] and we were disobedient but now we're
[50:42] obedient
[50:43] once we heard the word come under
[50:45] conviction and
[50:47] and
[50:47] accepted jesus christ as our lord and
[50:50] savior
[50:52] amen until you do that you're
[50:54] disobedient
[50:56] your heart needs to be turned
[50:58] are you with me
[51:00] if your heart is not turned you're going
[51:02] to keep on doing what you're doing and
[51:04] living like you're living
[51:06] because you don't want jesus
[51:09] amen as the jews did not want him
[51:11] because they didn't need him
[51:15] they were they had what they thought
[51:17] they needed so they didn't need jesus
[51:19] sometimes in our lives amen we don't
[51:22] have room for jesus because we're
[51:24] filling up with other things
[51:29] he said
[51:30] the wisdom of the just
[51:32] to make ready a people prepared for the
[51:35] lord see jesus went to prepare a place
[51:38] for us
[51:40] but there must become the spirit of
[51:42] elijah to come to prepare you for the
[51:44] lord
[51:46] are you with me
[51:48] god amen prepares you and i
[51:50] that we might be able to receive the
[51:52] lord god
[51:55] amen
[51:57] god is doing things but our hearts need
[52:00] to be turned the book of first king 18.
[52:04] first kings 18.
[52:06] amen
[52:08] it's something about this
[52:10] this world that we live in the people
[52:13] say they don't want god amen
[52:16] they just rejected the lord all together
[52:19] as a whole the nation have rejected god
[52:21] the world itself don't want god no more
[52:24] they don't think they need him
[52:27] they got everything else to fulfill
[52:30] that void in their life
[52:33] and the devil will feel the void and the
[52:36] thirst for god with all kind of stuff
[52:39] but it won't work it will never satisfy
[52:42] you you'll never have the peace of god
[52:44] and i'm
[52:47] let's just look at
[52:50] first kings 18 36
[52:53] and it says
[52:55] and it came to pass
[52:58] at
[53:00] the time of the offering
[53:03] of the evening sacrifice that elijah the
[53:06] prophet came near and said
[53:09] the lord
[53:10] god of abraham isaac and israel
[53:14] let it be known this day
[53:17] that thou art god in israel

[53:52] egypt
[53:54] and show enough god uh destroyed the
[53:56] egyptians in the red sea

[54:01] but the next move is god to save you
[54:03] from yourself
[54:06] are you with me
[54:10] because
[54:12] god dealt with them
[54:14] after the egyptian was destroyed he had
[54:16] to deliver them from themselves
[54:19] see when god brought them out of egypt
[54:22] god had to get egypt out of them

[54:47] clean you up
[54:49] amen they hadn't made it to the promised
[54:51] land but they were on their way to the
[54:52] promised land

[55:00] and accept jesus christ amen god is not
[55:03] true with you
[55:04] yet amen you're not completed as of yet

[1:09:56] so he says
[1:09:59] he you know he don't want you to keep
[1:10:01] part of the word

[1:10:10] thou and our son
[1:10:12] and our son sons and all the days of
[1:10:16] thy life

[1:10:20] days
[1:10:21] may be
[1:10:22] prolonged
[1:10:26] you know a lot of people
[1:10:28] days are not prolonged
[1:10:31] days are short
[1:10:33] to honor that father and their mother
[1:10:36] and their days will be long
[1:10:38] isn't that right
[1:10:40] but we can cut
[1:10:42] you got godly parents
[1:10:45] and you don't honor them
[1:10:48] you don't do what they tell you
[1:10:52] watch
[1:10:53] days of cuts show
[1:10:55] who you got to blame
[1:10:57] yourself
[1:10:59] because you did not honor mom and dad
[1:11:03] are you wondering
[1:11:04] it says
[1:11:06] here therefore o israel
[1:11:08] and deserve to do it

[1:11:20] are y'all with me
[1:11:22] that you may increase what
[1:11:27] see your blessings are being held back
[1:11:29] because of you
[1:11:32] it's not because god hadn't given it to
[1:11:34] you and god don't want you to have it
[1:11:36] it's because
[1:11:38] of
[1:11:38] you holding back on god
[1:11:44] and i will increase you mightily
[1:11:46] as the lord
[1:11:48] god
[1:11:49] of thy fathers has promised you
[1:11:52] god promised to bless you
[1:11:55] amen and blessing i will bless you and
[1:11:57] multiply it i'll multiply you you never
[1:12:00] saw the righteous of a second seed
[1:12:01] begging god to do things for you but how
[1:12:03] can he do it when you won't let him
[1:12:08] you must allow god to do what he said
[1:12:12] he'll do his promises are true
[1:12:17] god will do it if you just allow god to
[1:12:21] be god
[1:12:27] he said
[1:12:29] in the land
[1:12:31] that floyd's with milk and honey
[1:12:34] are you with me here
[1:12:37] oh israel
[1:12:38] the lord our god is what
[1:12:43] is one lord
[1:12:44] it ain't be one god
[1:12:46] are you with me
[1:12:48] all these other gods and all these
[1:12:50] things trying to take the place of god
[1:12:52] the bible says seek you first the
[1:12:53] kingdom of heaven and his righteousness
[1:12:55] and all other things would be what
[1:12:57] if anything you put before god is your
[1:13:00] god
[1:13:01] amen but if you seek god put god first
[1:13:05] amen then the blessings are yours
[1:13:08] the thing is we don't put god in his
[1:13:10] proper place
[1:13:12] the oh
[1:13:14] it's one lord
[1:13:16] he says
[1:13:18] and i shall what
[1:13:21] come on read read it again don't you
[1:13:23] what
[1:13:26] the prophet said what's wrong with
[1:13:28] people the reason why they do the stuff
[1:13:30] that they do because they don't love god
[1:13:36] the bible said when they knew god they
[1:13:38] glorified them not it's god
[1:13:41] it became vain in the imagination their
[1:13:43] foolish hearts were darkened
[1:13:45] because they didn't learn the love of
[1:13:47] the truth
[1:13:48] praise god
[1:13:50] i'm gonna tell you you got to love this
[1:13:52] truth

[1:14:07] have i hated
[1:14:09] amen your attitude towards the word your
[1:14:11] attitude how you respond and how you
[1:14:14] conduct your lives how you treat the
[1:14:16] word amen and then you want all the
[1:14:19] blessings
[1:14:22] amen it's not the church it's not the
[1:14:24] preacher it's the word of god
[1:14:29] i'm talking about turning the hearts
[1:14:33] praise god
[1:14:34] turning the hearts not just
[1:14:37] people say well i believe the message
[1:14:38] you know i'm turning back uh all that
[1:14:42] people draw nigh to me with their mouth
[1:14:45] that's what he said in isaiah but their
[1:14:48] hearts are what
[1:14:50] far for me
[1:14:52] this is not just lip service
[1:14:59] it's not just lip service
[1:15:01] brother fred said stop talking and
[1:15:03] get to walking
[1:15:06] okay
[1:15:08] so amen just don't talk and let's live
[1:15:11] it
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:13] you know it's good to talk about it but
[1:15:15] you got to live this thing
[1:15:19] amen
[1:15:24] know
[1:15:31] i i thought about i'm in the race
[1:15:35] i'm in the i'm in it this race to win it
[1:15:43] and i got to lose
[1:15:45] in order to gain
[1:15:48] are you with me
[1:15:50] you must be in this race to finish it
[1:15:55] and to win it
[1:15:57] amen you don't want to oh lose out on
[1:16:00] eternal life you want to win
[1:16:02] i might win christ
[1:16:04] okay i i let me
[1:16:07] he said the lord and thou shall love the
[1:16:10] lord thy god with what
[1:16:15] the major trouble you have in the church
[1:16:18] is a lack of love
[1:16:20] when you love god with all your heart
[1:16:22] you can it'll sustain you
[1:16:24] it's sustained you when
[1:16:27] trouble arrives it'll sustain
[1:16:30] you know oftentimes i just young young
[1:16:32] pastor early 20s and
[1:16:36] about close to 50 years ago
[1:16:40] oh
[1:16:40] i had some difficult counseling moments
[1:16:44] with couples that were sometimes
[1:16:46] fighting sometimes
[1:16:48] and they were twice my age sometimes
[1:16:51] and i'm counseling and trying to get
[1:16:54] marriages together and things like that
[1:16:57] it always was one of my first questions
[1:17:00] do you love her
[1:17:03] and they say yeah
[1:17:05] do you love him yeah
[1:17:07] okay we can work a little bit
[1:17:10] we can we can get through some stuff if
[1:17:12] we love one another
[1:17:14] but if you don't love one another
[1:17:17] it's difficult to patch stuff up
[1:17:21] you can't you can't hardly bring folks
[1:17:23] together when they don't love them
[1:17:26] if they say
[1:17:28] do you love him oh no
[1:17:32] love him
[1:17:34] i i don't think so
[1:17:38] see if you love him you can forgive him
[1:17:41] are you with
[1:17:42] me but if you don't love them you you
[1:17:45] ain't gonna hardly forgive them
[1:17:47] are you with me
[1:17:50] it's a lot of things amen but the the
[1:17:53] root of it is how much we love god
[1:17:58] because when you love god with all see
[1:18:01] other things is small things
[1:18:05] other things in life are small you can
[1:18:07] handle
[1:18:08] anything
[1:18:09] that comes your way when you love god
[1:18:12] with all your heart
[1:18:15] the problem uh that i've had through the
[1:18:19] course of about 50 years of preaching is
[1:18:22] amen the people come to
[1:18:25] places in their lives where they fell
[1:18:28] out of love
[1:18:30] it's hard to get a marriage together
[1:18:33] when people have fell out of love
[1:18:36] i'ma tell you brother fred that's a
[1:18:38] difficult thing when people come home
[1:18:42] and they're not in love it's just
[1:18:44] fussing and organ and all kind of stuff
[1:18:47] all they do is look at one another false
[1:18:50] one another problem and i mean you can't
[1:18:53] hardly live together like that
[1:18:56] the minute something turned one way
[1:19:00] oh goodness there's no chaotic
[1:19:04] but when you're loved you're going to be
[1:19:06] patient
[1:19:08] love is patient love is what
[1:19:10] kind
[1:19:12] and see
[1:19:13] you you
[1:19:15] the thing is with god
[1:19:17] amen we go down some rough roads
[1:19:20] sometimes god's gonna allow
[1:19:22] he said many are the what
[1:19:24] afflictions of the righteous
[1:19:27] are you with me
[1:19:30] as i said in mullins amen
[1:19:33] god said as many as i love i what
[1:19:37] i chase
[1:19:39] amen
[1:19:41] you know
[1:19:42] if you're going to be a son or daughter
[1:19:44] of god
[1:19:45] you got to endure chastisement
[1:19:49] you're gonna be you know because if
[1:19:51] you're not
[1:19:52] you know going through the chastisement
[1:19:54] time amen
[1:19:57] then god deals with you not his sons but
[1:19:59] as a what
[1:20:01] huh
[1:20:03] yeah y'all got it
[1:20:05] amen but you got to endure some things
[1:20:09] god will take you down roads amen and
[1:20:12] pathways amen that
[1:20:15] amen is show you what what's in you
[1:20:19] praise god amen and sometimes even in a
[1:20:22] marriage god shows up
[1:20:24] hey yeah i'm just showing you amen if
[1:20:27] you really love this sister you love
[1:20:30] this brother you're going to go through
[1:20:32] some stuff
[1:20:33] but y'all got to know if you really
[1:20:35] really truly love one another you won't
[1:20:38] even have to be patient and kind
[1:20:41] with one another
[1:20:43] and in this christian walk if you really
[1:20:45] love god with
[1:20:46] see that's what happens
[1:20:49] we only love a litter
[1:20:52] but that woman amen that was washing
[1:20:55] jesus feeding and kissing them and which
[1:20:58] is with her hair and all that she loved
[1:21:00] him much

[1:21:09] corner watching that woman criticized
[1:21:11] her

[1:21:15] of simons that invited jesus and didn't
[1:21:19] welcome him

[1:21:23] so by the grace of god
[1:21:25] god amen
[1:21:27] we invite jesus into our lives and in
[1:21:30] our homes amen and we don't welcome him
[1:21:35] praise god simon you didn't greet me at
[1:21:38] the door with some water and you know
[1:21:40] this woman with the basin and
[1:21:43] amen that i can wash my dirty feet but
[1:21:45] this woman's oh

[1:21:56] the dung and all of that that's in the
[1:21:58] streets
[1:22:00] but she loved him much
[1:22:04] and she had a lot of sin but she loved
[1:22:06] him
[1:22:07] brother and sister i'm talking about
[1:22:09] when you love you go through some stuff

[1:22:20] them
[1:22:24] the minute something goes you blow up

[1:22:33] somebody said something to me in the
[1:22:35] church

[1:22:38] relationship with god
[1:22:42] are you with me
[1:22:44] that person wasn't there when god saved
[1:22:47] you
[1:22:48] amen that person didn't die for you
[1:22:52] it was the blood of jesus
[1:22:55] amen praise god
[1:22:58] when you got filled with the holy ghost
[1:23:00] who was down
[1:23:02] that person couldn't feel you
[1:23:05] but god did it
[1:23:09] praise god
