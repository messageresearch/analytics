[20:11] a man appreciate this opportunity they

[20:17] vitami and minister with y'all Friday
[20:21] night let us pray
[20:27] Heavenly Father notice again we come
[20:31] before thy presence before that throne
[20:36] looking unto you who is the author and
[20:40] finisher of our faith Lord no matter
[20:46] what's going on in the world today Lord
[20:51] we'll be standing in the sacred place
[20:54] and began to exalt your name
[20:59] nothing matters then because we know we
[21:03] have a hope but if only hope we all men
[21:07] most miserable and we want to thank you
[21:10] tonight from the depths of our soul that
[21:16] you look upon us to say such a wretched
[21:20] sinner like me in the pardoning grace of
[21:26] your blood we thank you tonight we
[21:32] praise you tonight for your love and
[21:35] your mercy upon a sinner like I we likes
[21:41] you to forgive us of all sins and all
[21:45] flesh let it be removed that your spirit
[21:50] might have preeminence tonight that you
[21:53] would get glory and praise and that you
[21:57] would be lifted up above the heavens
[21:59] bless and anoint your word bless and
[22:03] anoint your people thank you Lord for
[22:06] the bride of Jesus Christ
[22:08] we love you now
[22:10] commit this service into your hands in
[22:13] Jesus Christ name as we stand tonight
[22:20] the book of Mark 11 mark 11
[22:34] and 25
[22:43] and it reads and when he and when ye
[22:49] stand praying forgive if you have all
[22:53] against any that your father also which
[22:56] is in heaven may forgive you of your
[22:59] stress passes but if you do not forgive
[23:03] neither where your father which is in
[23:05] heaven forgive your trespasses
[23:08] Romans 8
[23:16] and 28 and we know that all things work
[23:22] together for the good to them that love
[23:25] God and to them who are called according
[23:28] to his purpose for whom he did foreknow
[23:32] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[23:37] to the image of his son that he might be
[23:40] the firstborn among many brethren
[23:43] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[23:45] he also called and whom he called them
[23:49] he also justified and whom he justified
[23:51] them he also glorified
[23:54] what shall we then say to these things
[23:57] if God be for us who can be against us
[24:01] he that spared not his own son but
[24:04] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[24:09] how shall he not with him also freely
[24:12] give us all things who shall lay
[24:15] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[24:18] is God that justify it who is he that
[24:22] condemneth it is Christ that died yea
[24:24] rather that is risen again who is even
[24:28] at the right hand of God who also maketh
[24:30] intercession for us when the Lord had a
[24:34] blessing to the region I was afraid you
[24:36] may be seated I thought tonight pardon
[24:42] pardon / approved pardoned and approved
[24:51] as you looking at mark here he said
[24:54] forgive your brother ins of their
[24:57] trespasses and when you forgive don't
[25:01] carry it with you we look at pardon it
[25:04] said the action of forgiving or being
[25:08] forgiven the action of forgiving or
[25:11] being forgiven for an error or an
[25:14] offence Oh clemency mercy remission
[25:19] passing over offence without punishment
[25:23] so when pardon when your sins are
[25:27] pardoned you've been forgiven
[25:29] and God passed over the pardon of his
[25:34] Greece by the blood of Jesus Christ and
[25:37] it released you from a penalty or an
[25:40] obligation if you was released from a
[25:43] penalty or an obligation that's why the
[25:45] book of Romans says in 1828 said we know
[25:48] that all things work together for the
[25:50] good to them that love God and to them
[25:52] that are called according to his purpose
[25:54] so if God tonight God tonight as pardon
[25:57] your sins the Bible says in Romans 8 and
[26:02] 33 says who should lay anything to the
[26:04] charge of God's elect it is God that
[26:07] justify it so as we look at the
[26:09] pardoning of God's grace and maybe we
[26:11] look into prove see once you have been
[26:14] pardoned by His grace as Paul says in
[26:17] first Corinthians I didn't come to you
[26:19] with excellency of speech or men wisdom
[26:21] and knowing anything among you save
[26:23] Jesus Christ and him crucified so if you
[26:25] truly pardon tonight then the mercy and
[26:28] the crucified Savior Christ will be in
[26:31] you you know heard the prophet of God
[26:34] said that it's young man that was left
[26:38] his post of duty and they wanted to kill
[26:41] him it was during the time of war and he
[26:44] left his post of duty and it was going
[26:47] to execute him and his best friend went
[26:50] to Abraham Lincoln and said his son his
[26:53] friend didn't mean any harm and it kind
[26:55] of struck my heart inspiration say
[26:58] didn't mean any harm that could you
[27:00] write him a pardon that he could be free
[27:03] and Abraham Lincoln had his briefcase
[27:06] and he wrote on a piece of paper not the
[27:09] US United States and let her head but
[27:11] just wrote on a piece of paper pardon
[27:13] and his friend took it back to him in
[27:16] the jail cell and he said why you come
[27:19] to mock me because of that
[27:21] it ain't come from the president so
[27:24] tonight if we look at this as our pardon
[27:29] in Greece many would take the Bible and
[27:31] would throw it away but we look at the
[27:34] scriptures as our pardon and grace of
[27:36] Isaiah 53 says he was wounded for our
[27:38] transgressions he was bruised for our
[27:40] Nicky to chastise our peace was upon him
[27:42] and with His stripes
[27:43] we are here so when we accept a pardon
[27:46] in Greece of the blood of Jesus then
[27:48] your sins have been remitted don't let
[27:50] the devil take you back to him
[27:52] they have been remitted into the blood
[27:54] of Jesus and you've been pardoned and it
[27:56] should be a sacrifice crucified Savior
[28:00] in sorry showing that you say they've
[28:03] been pardoned Michael 7 Mike a 7 and 18
[28:16] and it says who is it God
[28:19] like unto thee that partner the iniquity
[28:23] and passes by the transgressions of the
[28:27] remnant of his heritage
[28:29] he retained not his anger forever
[28:33] because he delighteth in mercy so when
[28:38] you look at the pardoning of God's grace
[28:40] he ain't gonna hold his yo sins against
[28:43] you you know sometimes we can see it
[28:45] every day or do things wrong or say
[28:47] something wrong every day but the cause
[28:48] of that pardon in Greece of that blood
[28:51] that was shed at Calvary God looks over
[28:54] our sins and he will return he returned
[28:58] again he will have compassion upon us he
[29:02] will subdue our iniquities he and thou
[29:06] will cast all their sins into the depths
[29:08] of the sea see God will cast all our
[29:12] sins into the depths of the sea now when
[29:14] you look at pardon it's something that
[29:16] you have to accept you have to accept
[29:21] the pardoning grace of Jesus and Paul
[29:23] was looking at the Corinthians and Paul
[29:26] said because of your life you said you
[29:28] loved God but because of your life you
[29:31] haven't officially accepted God's pardon
[29:34] and grace because you took the chance at
[29:36] some place to plead or some Priester to
[29:39] live any kind of way but when you accept
[29:42] a pardon and grace of the blood of Jesus
[29:44] Christ and it goes beyond your intellect
[29:46] it goes down into the very depths of
[29:48] your heart then now your sins have been
[29:51] pardoned and now you're waiting to be
[29:53] approved Exodus
[29:57] 23 Exodus 23 and 20 behold I send mine
[30:09] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[30:12] way and to bring the into the police
[30:15] whether I have prepared beware of him
[30:20] and obey his voice provoked not him see
[30:24] when the angel the Lord or when the
[30:26] Spirit of the Lord trying to lead you in
[30:27] the right way sometimes we don't listen
[30:29] at the Spirit of God when your pardon
[30:31] the grace of God God sent an angel
[30:33] sending spirit to you and try to keep
[30:35] you in the right way even if you come
[30:37] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost or
[30:39] you have the Holy Ghost and you ain't
[30:40] really understanding how that the spirit
[30:43] moves in your life and the way things go
[30:45] in your life and leading by the spirit
[30:47] of being led by the spirit the Bible
[30:49] said they that are led by the Spirit of
[30:50] God they are the sons of God
[30:52] the prodigal said many people have the
[30:53] Spirit of God but they're not led
[30:55] correctly they will still want to do
[30:57] what they want to do but we got to
[30:58] continually surrender to his sovereign
[31:01] grace and His mercy we read something
[31:06] here I was reading from Andrew Murray
[31:09] the worship of the father is only to
[31:13] those to whom the Spirit of the son has
[31:16] been given the worship in spirit is only
[31:21] possible to those whom the son has
[31:26] revealed a father and who have received
[31:31] the spirit of sonship we read it again
[31:34] the worship of the father is only
[31:37] possible to those to whom the spirit of
[31:41] the son has been given and the worship
[31:45] in the spirit is only possible to those
[31:49] to whom the son has revealed the father
[31:52] who have proceeded the spirit of sonship
[31:57] now st. John says in John st. John 14
[32:00] and 20 said at that day you should know
[32:03] that I'm in the father and the father in
[32:04] me and I in you and you in me so there
[32:07] must be a
[32:08] perfect oneness of Jesus Christ in you
[32:11] not you saying he's in you but he's
[32:13] recognizing that he's in you not just
[32:16] you saying it but the manifestation of
[32:19] the Spirit of God in you showing that
[32:21] the pardon in Greece and what I like
[32:24] Sarita by pardoning is that when you
[32:26] receive a genuine pardoning of His grace
[32:28] there's a certain humility in a certain
[32:31] contrite spirit that goes along with it
[32:34] that says I am dead now I am dead now
[32:37] and I'm looking to be approved I'm
[32:41] looking for God's pardon and grace and
[32:43] I'm looking to be approved by God by the
[32:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[32:48] brings a certain humility that the power
[32:50] of the Resurrection leads you and
[32:52] directs you and God I by your grease
[32:57] you've accepted his pardon by the blood
[33:00] and you accept His Holy Ghost by the
[33:02] blood of Calvary and that blood should
[33:06] be so deep in our hearts to a point that
[33:09] God saved me a sinner saved by grace
[33:13] from somewhere that nobody know even
[33:15] knows the town I'm from but God saved me
[33:18] by His grace and I'm so indebted to God
[33:21] nothing I see nothing I look at can turn
[33:24] me away from the blood of Jesus because
[33:27] he saved me when I was unsavable he
[33:29] pardon my sins when it was unpardonable
[33:32] but by His mercy and grace he said I'm
[33:35] gonna save you because I know you would
[33:38] be destinated as Romans 8:28 says all
[33:41] things work together for the good tell
[33:43] them that love God he gave me an
[33:46] opportunity to love me by putting it
[33:49] Zini me that I would love it and then
[33:54] gave me pardon and grace by the blood
[33:56] that was shed at Calvary not the
[33:59] chemistry of the blood but the very life
[34:02] that was in that chemistry the very life
[34:05] comes back on a believer
[34:06] that's what Andrew Murray was saying
[34:09] that the son has revealed not
[34:12] intellectually but down in the heart has
[34:15] revealed to you the very substance of
[34:17] God now is in your heart so now you are
[34:20] manifestation of the unveiling of Christ
[34:23] not Jesus but Christ if we would be
[34:26] Jesus maybe another God
[34:28] but the unveiling of Christ which is the
[34:30] Anointed One Christ in us is the
[34:33] Anointed One Exodus 23 and 20 I sent
[34:42] mine angel to prepare the way
[34:48] beware of him and obey him said beware
[34:53] of him that angel beware of him that
[34:58] angel of the Covenant that angel is a
[35:02] spirit beware of the angel and obey his
[35:07] voice provoke him not for he was not
[35:12] pardon your transgressions for my name
[35:14] is in him but if thou shall indeed obey
[35:18] his voice and do all that I speak then
[35:22] will I then will then I will be an enemy
[35:27] to thine enemies and an adversary to
[35:30] thine adversaries for mine angel shall
[35:32] go before thee and bring thee into the
[35:36] into the amorite and the hittite and the
[35:39] perizzite
[35:39] and the Canaanites and that he rides in
[35:42] the Jebusites and I will cut them off
[35:45] God gonna cut these nations off from you
[35:48] if you follow the angel thou shall not
[35:54] bow down to their gods nor serve them
[35:57] nor do after their works but thou shalt
[36:00] utterly overthrow them and quite break
[36:03] them break down their images any images
[36:06] that don't want you to be humble any
[36:10] images that don't want you to be humble
[36:11] in pardoning of God's grace anything
[36:15] that takes you out from the word if a
[36:18] spirit comes and it doesn't take you
[36:20] back to the word then it's another
[36:22] spirit Paul said in Galatians if another
[36:25] angel come and preach anything different
[36:27] than what
[36:28] I preach please let him be a curse it
[36:31] must be with the Word of God what a word
[36:34] of God is the power is it he'll keep you
[36:37] from no enemies he will guide and direct
[36:39] you if you gonna keep you in the way
[36:42] that he infects you amen
[36:48] but some people just refuse to obey some
[36:53] people just refuse to obey what they
[36:54] ain't you say Nehemiah
[37:05] they just refused to do what the Angels
[37:07] say and sometimes they think danger just
[37:11] a man but the Angels the Spirit of the
[37:14] Lord the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost
[37:16] that's in you
[37:17] that's the angel that's leading you he
[37:20] led the children of Israel a cloud by
[37:23] day a pillar of fire by night the Angel
[37:26] of the Covenant is the Spirit of God in
[37:28] you once she received the Holy Ghost
[37:30] inside of you that is leading you st.
[37:33] John 14:26 said the comforter which is
[37:35] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[37:37] in my name he gonna lead you into all
[37:40] things we're not glorifying nobody but
[37:42] Jesus he's gonna send that angel in the
[37:45] name of Jesus and he when you see that
[37:47] that the Spirit of God is inside of you

[40:43] man and if you're in the hands of God
[40:45] and you trust him I'm I'm persuaded
[40:47] tonight as Paul says in enrollments I'm
[40:50] persuaded tonight that he'll keep that
[40:53] with you committed unto Him he'll do
[40:55] what you need tonight it might not come
[40:57] when you want it but God is gonna be
[40:59] their own time and he's gonna he don't

[41:09] long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[41:11] that any should perish but all should
[41:13] come to repentance all should come to
[41:17] repentance repent and be converted that
[41:20] your sins may be blotted out in the
[41:22] times of refreshing just to come from
[41:25] the Lord and he just said who Jesus
[41:30] Psalms 1 21 I got to the point I need
[41:35] these things now brothers tear me to get
[41:38] a bigger Bible bigger writing but I got
[41:40] the hold on I would lift up mine eyes
[41:43] unto the hills from whence cometh my
[41:45] help my help cometh from the Lord which
[41:47] made heaven and earth he will not suffer
[41:50] thy foot to be moved so your foot in
[41:52] will be moved he shall keep he that
[41:54] keepeth thee will not slumber behold he
[41:58] that keepeth Israel shall neither
[42:00] slumber nor sleep the Lord is thy keeper
[42:02] so you can't keep yourself if you think
[42:06] you can keep yourself you're in bad
[42:07] shape and you will see after a while you
[42:11] will see I throw odd that you can't keep
[42:13] yourself the Lord is your keeper he is
[42:17] your keeping you got the lead you could

[42:32] Lord is my keeper the Lord is thy shade
[42:34] upon thy right hand the Sun shall not
[42:38] smite thee by day nor the moon by night
[42:40] the Lord shall preserve thee from all
[42:42] evil he shall preserve thy soul the Lord
[42:45] shall preserve thy going out and thy
[42:46] coming in from this time even
[42:49] forevermore see he's our keeper tonight
[42:53] and because he has pardoned your sins
[42:55] tonight when your sins is truly pardoned
[42:58] it's the word of Jesus Christ it's the
[43:02] word of Lord the Lord in hell is hold
[43:04] into your heart in such a way that no
[43:07] matter how I'm treated or whatever you
[43:09] know I look at the boogie in the Bible
[43:11] Peter said Lord how much how many times
[43:14] shall my brother offend me and I forgive
[43:17] him seven times seven and Peter said
[43:19] Lord increase my faith but he says
[43:22] seventy times seven 490 times in a day
[43:25] that that brother offended but if you
[43:28] look back at the pardoning grace of
[43:30] Jesus and you look back at Chowdhury
[43:32] see we look back to Calvary and the Old
[43:35] Testament look to Calvary we look back
[43:37] to Calvary and see what the blood done
[43:38] it's all right to forgive then because
[43:41] of I didn't help forgiving grace inside
[43:43] of me pardon and grace inside of me I
[43:46] couldn't pardon that sin but because he
[43:48] had pardoned my sins I can pardon their
[43:51] sins because I know I wasn't nobody to
[43:53] be saved but he saved me beyond measure
[43:56] he saved me beyond my condition and I
[43:59] can look over that condition that much
[44:01] that God might be the righteousness in
[44:03] me that God might be the righteousness
[44:08] in me

[45:41] said now this is the one of knowing him
[45:42] he pardoned he approved in Daniels I
[45:46] mean second sent Samuel 16 and 5 through

[46:24] Genesis 45 1 through 7
[46:27] the sins were pardoned because they sold
[46:30] a brother they sold a brother and they
[46:34] left him in a ditch and they killed a
[46:35] kid and they put the blood on him and
[46:37] brought the coat back to Jake Joseph

[47:09] Israel is pardoned in 40 and one when he
[47:17] sent John the Baptist the voice of one
[47:19] crying in the wilderness Israel pardoned
[47:23] iniquity is pardoned it a man Ephesians
[47:31] 1:7
[47:48] Ephesians one in seven in whom we have
[47:51] redemption through his blood the
[47:54] forgiveness of sins according to the
[47:57] riches of His grace in whom we have
[48:01] redemption through his blood the
[48:02] forgiveness of sins according to the
[48:05] riches of His grace wherein he have
[48:07] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[48:10] prudence having made known unto us the
[48:14] mystery of his will see the mystery of
[48:16] his will when he pardoned us by his
[48:18] blood
[48:19] the mystery of approval in his will was
[48:22] that you might receive the pardoning
[48:24] grace of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:26] and been approved by God having made
[48:29] known see as I read in Andrew Murray
[48:32] those that receive his spirit and they
[48:35] enter into sonship so you must enter in
[48:39] the sonship by his spirit and he's made
[48:42] known unto us see without the spirit
[48:44] nothing can be made known to you but
[48:46] with the spirit that devil deed is made
[48:48] known and the righteous acts of God is
[48:51] now being planted in your spirit in your
[48:54] soul now all you want to do is the will
[48:56] of God and know what the word said I
[48:59] know the proper God he said on many
[49:01] occasions he the bride knows what he
[49:03] will done with the word and the only way
[49:05] she can know is that the same spirit
[49:08] that growling Jesus driving her Roma's
[49:11] evening lover that spirit must be in you
[49:13] and it'll quicken your mortal bodies not
[49:16] just for the rapture but a click in your
[49:19] body to the revelation of making known
[49:22] the mystery of Israel not in intellect
[49:25] but in the power of the Resurrection
[49:31] tippy-toes others want to get more
[49:33] knowledge knowledge is buffered up but
[49:35] charity never satisfied I want the
[49:38] revelation of the mystery of the
[49:40] anointed making known to me the mystery
[49:46] it must be made known until that you are
[49:50] deceived having made known
[49:58] until having made known unto us the
[50:02] mystery of his will according to his
[50:05] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[50:08] himself so if the bride is in Jesus then
[50:14] the mysteries in you all he doing is
[50:16] making it known to you because you have
[50:18] a spirit that in a dispensation of the
[50:23] fullness of times he might gather
[50:26] together in one all things in Christ so
[50:30] I say you couldn't be another Jesus but
[50:33] you could be Christ Christ means The
[50:36] Anointed One
[50:37] I teach down at the church in Camden the
[50:40] Lord is God Jesus is son in the church
[50:43] ages and Christ is in you now which is
[50:47] the hope of glory
[50:48] that's why John 14:26 had a cover which
[50:51] is the Holy Ghost their father goes
[50:54] sending me my name now didn't name her
[50:56] father son Holy Ghost not in the name of
[50:58] rose of Sharon he could send me in the
[50:59] name of Jesus because that's what
[51:01] redemption is in the name of Jesus
[51:03] that's why Paul said in acts 2 36
[51:05] therefore let all the house of Israel
[51:06] know it surely that God had made the
[51:07] same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord
[51:09] and Christ so if he made him both Lord
[51:12] and Christ so Christ is the anointed
[51:14] inside of you both Lord and Christ when
[51:16] they heard this they were pricked in
[51:17] their hearts and said unto Peter in the
[51:18] rest of the past men and brethren what
[51:19] shall we do he said repent repent means
[51:22] to be godly sorry that your father's
[51:23] might be remitted repent be godless
[51:26] sorry repent and be baptized every one
[51:28] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[51:30] the remission of sins and you shall
[51:32] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[51:34] the promise is unto you until your
[51:35] children is about fall even as many as
[51:37] the Lord our God shall call and I'm
[51:39] thankful tonight that he called me but
[51:41] not only don't just let him call you let
[51:43] him justify not only justify you let him
[51:46] sanctify you not only sanctify you let
