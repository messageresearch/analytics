[48:09] Hallelujah
[48:15] [Music]
[48:19] God is good to us
[48:22] before I forget my wife wanted me to
[48:27] agree sister
[48:33] she said make sure you test it to Renee
[48:35] I say hello
[48:36] I said well I'll make sure I tell her
[48:40] we appreciate you
[48:42] even though we're here on a sad occasion
[48:45] my
[48:48] one of my niece died and
[48:50] she'll be buried on tomorrow
[48:53] I played a very important part in her
[48:56] early life
[48:58] I used to
[49:01] be much so like the babysitter in a way
[49:07] I
[49:09] remember when she was born changed her
[49:12] diapers fed her
[49:15] and of course we had a
[49:19] a real close connection until I got
[49:21] saved
[49:23] and then after I got saved things went a
[49:26] different way
[49:28] I don't know whether she met the Lord
[49:30] but I did tell her about him
[49:34] and now it's between her and God
[49:37] thank God for our brother Simmons
[49:40] The church here I always feel at home
[49:42] when I'm here
[49:44] so if I act crazy here that's what I do
[49:46] at home
[49:48] and you know I'm not ashamed
[49:51] or What the Lord Has Done
[49:54] and uh now I'm going to tell you
[49:58] I'm going to have church if nobody else
[50:00] will
[50:02] I'm going to enjoy Jesus if no one else
[50:04] does
[50:06] as we stand let us turn to Romans 8 14.
[50:11] I believe this is a time of urgency
[50:16] I believe that the church is growing
[50:17] cold many people who have are Christians
[50:23] oh
[50:27] love seems to be diminishing
[50:32] they don't love the Lord like they used
[50:34] to
[50:37] and they forget that this is a battle
[50:41] I remember when I first received the
[50:44] Holy Ghost
[50:46] I thought I was going to be shouting to
[50:48] Jesus come
[50:51] didn't understand that there was coming
[50:52] a lot of battles
[50:56] and I like to see myself as a a battle
[51:00] scarred veteran
[51:02] because I don't want to go to heaven
[51:03] with no scars
[51:06] I want to look like I've been in a
[51:09] battle
[51:11] I want to not only look like it but I
[51:13] want to know
[51:15] by God's grace that this has been a
[51:17] battle
[51:18] and I know one thing the greater the
[51:20] battle
[51:22] the sweeter Heaven is going to be
[51:25] we forget about that we we sometimes
[51:27] look at the Battle and forget about what
[51:29] comes afterwards
[51:31] but it's great victory in the name of
[51:33] Jesus Romans 8 to 14 8 14.
[51:39] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[51:42] God
[51:43] they are
[51:45] the sons of God
[51:48] that's the only one I'm going to read
[51:49] there
[51:50] then I ask that you turn with us to
[51:52] Saint John
[51:54] the eighth chapter
[51:57] 14 through the 46th verse
[52:00] we enjoyed the song service we were in
[52:02] the back
[52:04] but somehow the
[52:07] music the organ and all
[52:10] was really uh soothing my soul
[52:16] I got caught up in the spirit back there
[52:18] I don't know whether y'all heard me or
[52:19] not
[52:23] wasn't trying to be heard but I figured
[52:26] I was pretty loud enough but uh it was
[52:27] it got pretty good
[52:31] Saint John 8 44-46
[52:36] yeah of your father the devil
[52:40] and the lust of your father ye will do
[52:44] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[52:46] a vote not in the truth
[52:49] because there is no truth in him
[52:52] when he speaketh the lie he's speaketh
[52:54] of his own
[52:56] for he is a liar and the father of it
[53:00] and because I tell you the truth
[53:02] ye Believe Me Not
[53:05] which of you convinced
[53:07] convinces me of sin
[53:10] if I say the truth
[53:13] why do ye not believe me
[53:16] one more scripture
[53:17] Malachi 3
[53:21] I just love this this scripture Malachi
[53:25] 3
[53:26] 16-18
[53:32] and then they that fear the lord spake
[53:35] often one to another
[53:38] and the Lord hearkened and heard it
[53:41] in a book of remembrance was written
[53:44] before him
[53:45] for them that fear the lord
[53:48] and that thought upon his name
[53:54] they and they shall be mine said the
[53:56] Lord of hosts
[53:57] in that day when I make up my jewels
[54:01] and I will spare them as a man's Spirit
[54:04] his own son
[54:06] that serveth him
[54:10] then shall ye return
[54:14] and discern between the righteous and
[54:16] the wicked
[54:18] between him that serveth God
[54:21] and him that serveth him not
[54:25] let us pray
[54:26] pray
[54:28] dear gracious father we
[54:31] come before your Lord we thank you for
[54:33] your grace and your mercy
[54:36] we thank you for being so good to us
[54:40] truly Lord there's no words to express
[54:43] our gratitude toward you
[54:46] right now my
[54:48] soul is
[54:51] just rejoicing
[54:54] in spite of all of the oppositions
[54:57] because I realize Lord God we're about
[55:00] ready to embrace eternity in a way
[55:04] our minds cannot comprehend
[55:07] but we realize also Lord that it's been
[55:10] because of your grace
[55:12] not because we've been such a great
[55:14] person
[55:16] we realize Lord that we have all sinned
[55:19] and come short of your glory
[55:21] we all needed a savior
[55:23] and I thank you Lord Jesus Christ for
[55:26] being my savior
[55:28] you may all in all
[55:31] and I thank you Lord for being who you
[55:33] are in my life
[55:35] bless the service in a special way
[55:38] I know you will
[55:40] I know you will
[55:42] you promised Lord
[55:44] where two or three are gathered in your
[55:46] name
[55:47] there you are in the midst
[55:50] so we know that you're here Lord
[55:52] and we appreciate you may God help us
[55:55] honor you give us Grace to move
[55:57] completely out of your way
[55:59] we give you the glory praise and honor
[56:02] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[56:05] you may be seated
[56:15] we
[56:17] have been ministering at my own assembly
[56:24] and so many things have
[56:27] we've tried to accomplish
[56:31] with the people
[56:34] foreign
[56:37] but we realize a man that only
[56:40] God can touch the heart
[56:44] only God can change the heart
[56:47] we come to church
[56:50] not as Believers that are traditional
[56:55] you know how we come up in prayer we
[56:57] come up in prayer we want prayer and
[56:59] you're very seldom see a tear
[57:03] drop
[57:05] or someone else that is broken
[57:08] it's hard to find
[57:11] that Brokenness in the people
[57:15] somehow the cares of this life has
[57:18] hardened the hearts even for the
[57:22] Believers
[57:24] we come and we think that we're
[57:27] satisfying God by showing up
[57:32] but I remember what God said to
[57:35] the Jews he says if you don't praise me
[57:38] I'll raise up a rock
[57:40] so God is not looking for praisers
[57:45] are worshipers
[57:48] he's got them
[57:51] when we think about
[57:54] and I don't think and I just want to
[57:56] take my time this morning
[57:58] because this message to me is a matter
[58:01] of life and death
[58:04] the word of God is a matter of life and
[58:07] death
[58:09] but it's up to God to unveil to you the
[58:13] Naked Truth
[58:15] people say I want truth give me truth
[58:18] but when truth comes
[58:21] and when it comes in a way that is
[58:24] different
[58:26] from the way that you've been preached
[58:29] to in the past years
[58:32] we tried to screen truth
[58:35] by our own systematic way our old
[58:39] systematic way and when we do that
[58:43] we we we we fail to see truth
[58:48] when Jesus was crucified
[58:51] he was naked
[58:53] he didn't have a covering
[58:56] because covering represents religion
[58:59] he had nothing there it was absolutely
[59:02] the naked word
[59:05] he became naked
[59:08] naked that we might be clothed
[59:11] what a shame
[59:13] your savior
[59:15] and my savior
[59:17] was lifted up on Calvary
[59:20] naked
[59:24] who would follow such a man
[59:27] who dies like a like a failure
[59:32] but that was his victory
[59:36] and when he was down Calvary amen he had
[59:39] you and I in his mind you and me
[59:43] he understood what he was doing he
[59:46] wasn't LED blindly
[59:49] but he was led willfully
[59:53] to Calvary
[59:57] now the thing that I don't understand
[1:00:00] even now is why people are not happy
[1:00:05] it's the joy of the Lord
[1:00:09] and the reason why many people are not
[1:00:12] happy is because they still have that
[1:00:15] old cloak of religion on
[1:00:18] but when you recognize the word of your
[1:00:20] day
[1:00:21] when you understand that you've been
[1:00:23] Justified and so you've never sinned in
[1:00:26] the first place
[1:00:27] when you understand that every penalty
[1:00:30] of death
[1:00:32] was paid for you
[1:00:34] you could not have done it
[1:00:37] it took Jesus
[1:00:40] it took a lamb without spot wrinkle or
[1:00:43] blemish
[1:00:44] he paid the price
[1:00:47] and the Bible said he became we became
[1:00:49] he became our sin that we might become
[1:00:51] his righteousness
[1:00:53] well I accepted by faith
[1:00:56] I might not look like I'm righteous
[1:01:00] but when you're covered by the blood
[1:01:03] Hallelujah it is not only just
[1:01:06] righteousness
[1:01:08] but the blood of Jesus Christ amen held
[1:01:12] the Holiness of God
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:18] Hallelujah but nowadays
[1:01:21] people don't want they say they want the
[1:01:23] Holy Ghost but you can't get it
[1:01:26] until you're willing to change
[1:01:30] Hallelujah
[1:01:32] that's why the Bible's people said uh
[1:01:34] the the word comes along and tells us
[1:01:37] if you repent and be baptized in the
[1:01:41] name of Lord Jesus Christ you shall
[1:01:43] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:46] he said well what do you mean brother
[1:01:47] Brooks
[1:01:48] that's when you are in full obedience to
[1:01:51] the word
[1:01:53] because he was in full obedience to the
[1:01:57] word
[1:01:58] you personally cannot be in full
[1:02:00] obedience because you're sinners
[1:02:04] you're faulty
[1:02:06] but when you take a lamb
[1:02:08] Jesus Christ himself
[1:02:11] comes into who who there was no spot
[1:02:15] there was no wrinkle there was no
[1:02:18] blemish he became your savior
[1:02:21] and it's in him you are accepted in the
[1:02:25] Beloved
[1:02:26] Hallelujah all the joy that came to me
[1:02:31] when I knew
[1:02:33] see it's a personal thing you got to
[1:02:36] know you're free
[1:02:37] Hallelujah you got to know that the
[1:02:41] blood of Jesus Christ was enough
[1:02:44] hallelujah it's not your church it's not
[1:02:48] your religion it's not your your
[1:02:51] composition is Jesus Christ
[1:02:56] and him alone
[1:03:03] my subject is
[1:03:06] is the will of God
[1:03:08] that you go beyond your boundaries
[1:03:12] everybody loves it
[1:03:14] you have your comfort zones
[1:03:20] wake up
[1:03:23] everybody looking at everything but me
[1:03:29] but we must
[1:03:31] I see what I'm talking about
[1:03:34] it's something that's wrong with the
[1:03:37] spirit of the people
[1:03:40] there's a time we used to run to church
[1:03:43] to hear the word
[1:03:46] now we find out that people don't that
[1:03:49] it's like they can't hear it
[1:03:51] with all of the preaching that you
[1:03:53] preach it seems like it goes beyond I
[1:03:56] don't know it's like the people have a
[1:03:58] spell cast upon them
[1:04:00] may God help us
[1:04:02] because the only one that can get you
[1:04:05] out of this pit
[1:04:07] is God himself
[1:04:09] and let me say it like this you won't be
[1:04:12] the only one that has ever been in the
[1:04:13] pit
[1:04:14] David says Lord
[1:04:16] deliver me from this horrible pit
[1:04:19] oh I'm coming
[1:04:21] and God was the only one
[1:04:24] [Music]
[1:04:25] that could deliver David
[1:04:28] Hallelujah and right now God is the only
[1:04:33] one
[1:04:33] Jesus himself is the only one that can
[1:04:36] deliver you
[1:04:38] some of us think well I don't need
[1:04:40] Deliverance yes you do
[1:04:43] because God said I would that you be hot
[1:04:46] or cold
[1:04:48] there is no lukewarm Christians in
[1:04:51] heaven
[1:04:52] and none of them were qualify
[1:04:55] to make it
[1:04:56] not when it comes to a rapture
[1:04:59] Calvary he bore my shame you know I
[1:05:03] can't preach a message without preaching
[1:05:04] Calvary that's the very gospel
[1:05:08] Hallelujah and until you oh I love the
[1:05:12] message but you don't even know what
[1:05:13] happened to Calvary
[1:05:16] Calgary is the message
[1:05:19] Christ died for you
[1:05:23] he took your place
[1:05:26] oh people let me tell you something the
[1:05:28] early Christians didn't have all that we
[1:05:30] have
[1:05:31] y'all better hear me they didn't have no
[1:05:34] books they didn't have no tapes but you
[1:05:37] know what they had the Holy Ghost
[1:05:40] Hallelujah and they were led by the
[1:05:43] spirit of God
[1:05:45] they knew right from wrong
[1:05:48] by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:51] that's how they were able to identify
[1:05:53] the Antichrist because they had Christ
[1:05:59] Hallelujah and when you got the
[1:06:01] Hallelujah when you've got the Holy
[1:06:04] Ghost
[1:06:05] you don't need a book to study
[1:06:08] to see whether it's right or wrong
[1:06:11] the Holy Ghost checks you
[1:06:14] oh come on somebody
[1:06:16] what you gonna do when they take your
[1:06:17] books what you're going to do when they
[1:06:20] take your Bible
[1:06:21] and you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:24] how on Earth will you know what's right
[1:06:25] from wrong
[1:06:29] Hallelujah
[1:06:31] I saw my brother Matt come in
[1:06:34] always admired you brother
[1:06:36] always
[1:06:38] if not we don't get to talk that much
[1:06:40] but I've always admired you
[1:06:42] I I got my reasons for that but I
[1:06:44] appreciate you
[1:06:46] amen
[1:06:47] God is good
[1:06:49] yes sir when we when we think about
[1:06:55] Who you gonna follow
[1:06:57] you understand me when I say that you
[1:07:00] got one or it you're gonna follow God
[1:07:03] or you're gonna follow the devil
[1:07:06] huh one thing about Jesus he's naked
[1:07:11] he doesn't have a cloak
[1:07:13] his word is his word
[1:07:16] what he says is what he means
[1:07:19] Hallelujah but Satan cloaks himself
[1:07:23] he disguises himself
[1:07:25] right this old evil disguises himself
[1:07:28] like an angel of Light
[1:07:30] amen hallelujah but not like Jesus
[1:07:33] Jesus Christ is who he is
[1:07:36] Hallelujah he is God
[1:07:39] what is your ambition and I'm gonna I
[1:07:41] gotta jump I'm spending too much time
[1:07:43] with this
[1:07:44] but you know uh your ambition
[1:07:48] uh is is to become the word
[1:07:52] you've got to grow into it or it has to
[1:07:55] grow into you however we want to look at
[1:07:58] it
[1:07:59] because because you have to realize this
[1:08:02] is manifestation time
[1:08:05] I was telling my church I said when I
[1:08:08] was when God planted himself in me I was
[1:08:10] a little Christian a little boy
[1:08:12] Christian you understand me I made a lot
[1:08:15] of mistakes I grew up
[1:08:17] and I've grown up and I'm still growing
[1:08:21] I didn't stay the same
[1:08:23] you understand me and whatever is alive
[1:08:27] never stays the same
[1:08:30] I don't care if it's a kitten
[1:08:33] it's going to turn into a mature cat
[1:08:36] it was a baby it's going to turn into an
[1:08:38] adult
[1:08:39] if it's alive it's going to grow
[1:08:43] and whatever life that's in it is going
[1:08:46] to manifest itself
[1:08:50] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:08:52] it's not something you can put on not
[1:08:55] like this crazy generation we got now
[1:08:58] Hallelujah that want to be something
[1:09:00] they're not
[1:09:01] oh
[1:09:03] I was telling my church the other day I
[1:09:05] said y'all better get the Holy Ghost
[1:09:07] you might wake up thinking you're a cat
[1:09:10] huh
[1:09:11] you better get the Holy Ghost you might
[1:09:14] think you're a dog
[1:09:16] because my brother looks right there in
[1:09:18] Japan this man thinks he's so much like
[1:09:20] a dog he went and got him a suit
[1:09:23] a whole uniform looking out the window
[1:09:26] like a dog
[1:09:29] but see that is the insanity
[1:09:34] that's now striking the nation and let
[1:09:37] me tell you if you don't have that token
[1:09:40] if you don't have that Holy Spirit
[1:09:43] Hallelujah you will believe a lie
[1:09:52] in this day
[1:09:54] let's put it in those Moses day you had
[1:09:57] to believe Moses or you had to believe
[1:09:59] pharaoh
[1:10:01] right now Moses said listen if you don't
[1:10:04] reply the blood
[1:10:06] the death angel is going to get you
[1:10:08] I love somebody let me put it in terms
[1:10:11] of your term our term God don't care if
[1:10:15] you're a doctor if you're a lawyer if
[1:10:18] you're a policeman if you are a teacher
[1:10:21] if the blood is not applied
[1:10:25] the death angel will get you
[1:10:28] hallelujah how do you know what's going
[1:10:31] on brother Brooks because people oh they
[1:10:34] come to this message and they clothe
[1:10:36] themselves with the letter of it but
[1:10:38] they never get born again
[1:10:40] they never get the Holy Ghost now you
[1:10:44] see what they really are
[1:10:47] it was always there
[1:10:49] whatever the nature is in you it will
[1:10:52] manifest itself and it's not going to
[1:10:55] get any better
[1:10:56] unless you repent
[1:11:00] you see how they got quiet on that one
[1:11:02] people don't want to repent because
[1:11:04] everybody think they're okay
[1:11:06] Hallelujah
[1:11:08] you know what even if brother Brandon
[1:11:10] was my pastor
[1:11:12] past it never would have saved me
[1:11:16] hello
[1:11:19] people go to my church I can't save them
[1:11:22] I'm not a savior
[1:11:26] there's only one Savior and that's Jesus
[1:11:30] Christ
[1:11:31] Hallelujah people say oh with Moses he
[1:11:35] was a deliverer yes he was
[1:11:38] but it wasn't Moses it was the god in
[1:11:40] Moses and all your two in that
[1:11:43] generation saw who to deliver a while
[1:11:46] I wonder whether the people are seeing
[1:11:48] who to deliver really is this morning
[1:11:51] oh help of Jesus y'all looking at me
[1:11:55] like I'm crazy but I'm gonna tell you
[1:11:56] like this
[1:11:58] it is a desperate time
[1:12:01] it is a time where you know that you
[1:12:04] know you don't feel the anointing of God
[1:12:07] like you're used to
[1:12:08] and if you are honest you will
[1:12:11] acknowledge that
[1:12:12] but the problem is we're setting still
[1:12:15] we're not doing anything about it
[1:12:18] you don't even realize that death
[1:12:21] shifting you is that right
[1:12:24] oh that's what God told Peter Peter
[1:12:26] don't you understand the devil desire to
[1:12:28] sift you as wheat
[1:12:31] we don't see amen the condition that
[1:12:33] we're in amen is not where God wants us
[1:12:36] to be oh don't look at me let me say it
[1:12:39] like this what I'm preaching here I
[1:12:41] preach to my church
[1:12:43] because that's the hour we're living in
[1:12:45] people who can't even love each other
[1:12:49] but call yourself Christians
[1:12:52] can't even forgive
[1:12:54] and if you can't forgive all your
[1:12:57] Christianity is in vain
[1:13:01] well you don't know what that person did
[1:13:03] to me let me ask you a question what
[1:13:05] have you done to Christ
[1:13:07] how many times you've denied him
[1:13:09] how many times you've been ashamed of
[1:13:11] him
[1:13:12] oh come on somebody
[1:13:14] how many times when you should have
[1:13:16] witnessed for him you did not
[1:13:20] Don't Preach like that brother
[1:13:22] all I can tell you is this I'm gonna
[1:13:24] tell you just the way he wants me to
[1:13:26] tell you
[1:13:27] Hallelujah I haven't even got to my
[1:13:29] message yet let me move on
[1:13:32] it because I haven't even got that in
[1:13:35] Jesus day amen they had to choose
[1:13:37] between Jesus and Barabbas
[1:13:40] Barabbas was a murderer
[1:13:43] but he was a systematic
[1:13:46] believer
[1:13:49] he was a Jew
[1:13:51] he wasn't a gentile
[1:13:53] his God was Jehovah
[1:13:56] but what did it do for him
[1:13:59] what did that religion do for him
[1:14:02] it caused him to unite with Rome to
[1:14:05] crucify Jesus
[1:14:07] y'all hear me
[1:14:09] now you've got a choice
[1:14:11] who you're going to serve
[1:14:14] I'm coming
[1:14:16] see what it is now the reason why we
[1:14:19] don't see God like we should
[1:14:20] because everybody's God is all mixed
[1:14:23] with something
[1:14:26] mixed with some kind of idea ideology or
[1:14:30] something you got you got things so
[1:14:32] mixed
[1:14:33] and this is why I tell my children I I
[1:14:37] know what God is doing he's perfected me
[1:14:40] and he's got me going through a lot of
[1:14:42] these things in my life because I I need
[1:14:45] it I want it I want change and this is
[1:14:49] why we come to church to be changed we
[1:14:52] come to be corrected oh I don't mind the
[1:14:54] shout and the dance but when I leave
[1:14:57] here I want to know that I got something
[1:15:00] that changed me that made me think now
[1:15:04] in a different way
[1:15:07] mixed
[1:15:09] everybody you know they got their Creeds
[1:15:12] they got their affiliations and all
[1:15:14] kinds of entertainment going on and you
[1:15:17] know it's all mixed up
[1:15:19] you know I could have a big big uh
[1:15:22] fellowship and uh at the church and
[1:15:24] everybody will show up
[1:15:27] but then when you go to church
[1:15:29] hardly nobody shows up
[1:15:32] Hallelujah matter of fact if you come to
[1:15:36] my Wednesday night services
[1:15:38] you'd feel sorry for me
[1:15:42] if I got a good 10 people in church
[1:15:45] but I don't care
[1:15:47] I preach like I got a whole church full
[1:15:51] because in reality I do
[1:15:54] now let me go on
[1:15:56] why are you saying these things
[1:15:59] because you got to realize that here it
[1:16:01] was when they were coming out of Egypt
[1:16:04] they had to eat all of the Lamb
[1:16:07] they had to eat the entrance intros and
[1:16:10] all of the bitter parts and they
[1:16:12] couldn't leave anything and I thought
[1:16:15] about that this morning I'm not I'm
[1:16:17] feasting on the meat
[1:16:19] Hallelujah now this may seem simple but
[1:16:22] I'm thinking on the meat which is the
[1:16:24] Lamb of God
[1:16:25] and what am I doing what did it do for
[1:16:28] them it gave them strength for the
[1:16:30] journey
[1:16:31] see without the word without the message
[1:16:33] you have no strength for the journey
[1:16:36] and what happens you get weak
[1:16:39] don't tell me
[1:16:41] you call for a prayer meeting how many
[1:16:43] people come to the prayer meeting
[1:16:45] excuse me
[1:16:46] how many people shows up
[1:16:49] Hallelujah oh I'm not picking on you I'm
[1:16:52] trying to
[1:16:54] pinch you
[1:16:55] you know what pinch
[1:16:57] that's a very uncomfortable feeling
[1:17:00] and some people can do it in there twist
[1:17:02] it
[1:17:03] well if I could just pinch you and twist
[1:17:06] it a little bit just to get your
[1:17:08] attention even if I can make you mad at
[1:17:10] me
[1:17:12] I know you'll remember
[1:17:14] Hallelujah now you say what do you mean
[1:17:17] brother Brooks
[1:17:18] see we can't sympathize with the message
[1:17:22] we must become it
[1:17:24] y'all understand me that is the only
[1:17:27] thing that's going to identify you
[1:17:29] separate you from being the fake or the
[1:17:32] real
[1:17:34] Hallelujah it is the only thing that's
[1:17:37] going to make you different from all
[1:17:39] ever ever I don't care our fellowship
[1:17:41] for church church I don't care about
[1:17:43] much of the adoption it ain't about that
[1:17:46] it's whether you have you have you been
[1:17:48] have you been baptized with the Holy
[1:17:51] Ghost since you believe
[1:17:54] right
[1:17:55] we welcome change we welcome correction
[1:17:59] Hallelujah but I want you to understand
[1:18:01] you've got to decide which one you are
[1:18:04] am I the seed of God
[1:18:06] or am I the seed of the devil
[1:18:10] um
[1:18:11] oh when I go to church so did Judas
[1:18:15] so the king
[1:18:17] oh I like the preaching you know and
[1:18:20] this is what makes me Marvel hey Judas
[1:18:23] had all of these gifts
[1:18:25] he had everything but one thing he did
[1:18:28] not have was The Giver
[1:18:31] he could not receive that Jesus Christ
[1:18:34] was truly the Messiah
[1:18:37] Hallelujah he saw the signs he saw the
[1:18:40] Wonders he saw the Miracles but he had
[1:18:43] his own agenda
[1:18:46] Hallelujah there's only one agenda in
[1:18:49] this thing is to make sure that people
[1:18:51] see Jesus Christ
[1:18:53] not so much brother brought I don't even
[1:18:55] care if my name is ever remembered but
[1:18:58] it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:00] I'm trying to get people to see you say
[1:19:03] well what do you mean brother Brooks let
[1:19:05] me tell you this the devil will stamp
[1:19:07] that name out if he can
[1:19:09] well because there's only power in the
[1:19:13] name of Jesus Christ
[1:19:15] Hallelujah
[1:19:17] is that right
[1:19:18] like I was telling my church I said you
[1:19:20] can't come to church with your little
[1:19:22] attitudes and whether you're going to
[1:19:24] set on somebody that's seeing if you
[1:19:26] don't like them you're gonna you're not
[1:19:28] gonna say amen and all that nonsense go
[1:19:30] up
[1:19:32] we ought to be so glad to see each other
[1:19:35] in this place
[1:19:36] Hallelujah
[1:19:38] don't worry about me when I backslide
[1:19:40] because you could have helped me when I
[1:19:43] was standing you wasn't standing with me
[1:19:45] Hallelujah then you want to talk about
[1:19:47] the person that batch lies shame on you
[1:19:53] what did you do to keep them
[1:19:57] keep them where was your love
[1:19:59] Hallelujah you know very very rarely
[1:20:03] will you see somebody go try to catch a
[1:20:06] backslider
[1:20:08] somebody backslide you just talk about
[1:20:10] them and keep going
[1:20:12] and some of us still got that
[1:20:13] Progressive mentality
[1:20:15] we won't even speak to them
[1:20:19] find that in the word
[1:20:23] huh find it in the word it ain't there
[1:20:29] leave 99 and and for the one what about
[1:20:34] you
[1:20:34] because when Christ in you he behaves
[1:20:38] like Christ
[1:20:39] Hallelujah let me move on many that are
[1:20:42] led by the spirit of God
[1:20:44] just the other day and I'm not boasted
[1:20:46] on me
[1:20:47] my wife and I
[1:20:49] we had to go down to Lima Ohio
[1:20:52] and I was actually going down there to
[1:20:54] rest what rest but anyway that's what I
[1:20:56] was doing
[1:20:57] I thought I'd visit my son
[1:21:00] let's camp out at his place he was too
[1:21:01] busy we had to end up going to a
[1:21:04] restaurant I mean a hotel but
[1:21:06] nevertheless
[1:21:07] I used to love Captain D's but I didn't
[1:21:10] want to go to Captain D's my wife with
[1:21:11] the Captain D's so I went with her so
[1:21:14] she we ordered some food and stuff and
[1:21:16] and then I'm setting down as I sat down
[1:21:19] there was uh two uh three white folks uh
[1:21:23] there uh a lady and and two ladies and a
[1:21:26] man and I'm sitting there and the Holy
[1:21:29] Spirit said get up just like a natural
[1:21:31] man go testify
[1:21:33] go tell them how God has delivered you
[1:21:36] from your prostrate cancer
[1:21:38] and people it did come from here
[1:21:41] my looks like my shirt shook
[1:21:44] it came from my heart
[1:21:47] and I sat there and I'm like Lord these
[1:21:50] people don't know me and I'm I'm in Lima
[1:21:52] Ohio
[1:21:54] you maybe will not understand what I'm
[1:21:55] talking about but anyway I'm sitting
[1:21:58] there
[1:21:59] and he said get up go testify and you
[1:22:03] know how we do Lord is that really you
[1:22:07] and the next thing I know I'm up out of
[1:22:10] my seat
[1:22:11] and I'm headed toward the bathroom and I
[1:22:13] knew I was supposed to talk to them
[1:22:15] so I'm going towards like I'm going to
[1:22:17] the bathroom I had to turn around
[1:22:19] and I said man I said ma'am do I know
[1:22:22] you she said no I don't I said I know
[1:22:24] you don't but I had to get a
[1:22:25] conversation going I said
[1:22:29] I said I come to tell you about what
[1:22:32] Jesus has done for me I said I used to
[1:22:34] have prostate cancer and I'm totally
[1:22:37] free I said I even got paperwork it been
[1:22:40] showing that I had cancer and I got
[1:22:42] paperwork showing I have no cancer at
[1:22:44] all
[1:22:45] Hallelujah I said they said this Castle
[1:22:48] ain't gone to my bone and all that kind
[1:22:50] of stuff the lady started crying
[1:22:53] she said my husband
[1:22:55] right now is suffering from prostrate
[1:22:58] cancer
[1:23:00] and he must have been bad because I said
[1:23:03] ma'am do you mind if I pray for you so
[1:23:05] we start praying and Captain D's
[1:23:09] you know what I'm saying
[1:23:10] I didn't say no
[1:23:13] no uh
[1:23:15] no I prayed like I was praying in church
[1:23:20] and I prayed for him and everything else
[1:23:22] and this man so believed he got up to go
[1:23:25] to the restroom to check it out
[1:23:28] he comes back out the door but he's a
[1:23:30] little discouraged because it didn't
[1:23:31] happen instantaneously so I sit down and
[1:23:34] said I said listen
[1:23:37] I said I'm trying to remember the order
[1:23:39] but let me say it like this
[1:23:40] I said uh
[1:23:43] they said where do you go to church I
[1:23:45] said uh ma'am I'm I'm from Iowa my
[1:23:48] church is in Iowa
[1:23:49] I said so you know I don't know you
[1:23:52] I said but he does
[1:23:54] I didn't know your husband had cancer I
[1:23:57] said but he did he knows it I said if we
[1:24:00] just prayed for him and I believe God is
[1:24:03] just healed your husband and I looked at
[1:24:06] him I said listen no I went back to my
[1:24:08] seat God said get back up explain to
[1:24:10] them
[1:24:11] so I went to there and says listen God
[1:24:13] could have healed you and it could have
[1:24:15] been a miracle he didn't give you that
[1:24:16] just now as far as I can see I said but
[1:24:18] listen he healed you I know he did
[1:24:21] I said that wasn't me I don't know you
[1:24:24] but it was God who made me get up out of
[1:24:26] my seat
[1:24:29] oh y'all don't understand
[1:24:32] I got to preach what I feel like crying
[1:24:33] right now but my point is I explained to
[1:24:37] him I said uh uh healing he takes about
[1:24:39] three days four days in the four days
[1:24:41] you deliver it and it might get a little
[1:24:42] worse but remember this day remember
[1:24:44] this one this moment this man prayed for
[1:24:48] you and God said you understand me and
[1:24:52] when I said do you believe that both
[1:24:53] says yes we believe
[1:24:55] and they walked out of the
[1:24:57] restaurant you say brother Brooks how do
[1:25:00] you know the hill God said so
[1:25:03] Hallelujah I don't they don't need to
[1:25:06] know my name they don't need to know
[1:25:08] where I come from but they do need to
[1:25:11] know Jesus healed
[1:25:13] Hallelujah and they themselves were
[1:25:16] Christians
[1:25:18] y'all hear what I'm saying that's what
[1:25:20] being led by the spirit
[1:25:22] he said why are you saying this because
[1:25:24] I have been praying
[1:25:30] that God would restore my hearing
[1:25:33] of his voice
[1:25:37] that I would be obedient
[1:25:39] to whatever
[1:25:41] he wanted me to do
[1:25:43] so it was a blessing to me
[1:25:46] to be able to do that people of God
[1:25:48] y'all remember today
[1:25:50] God would speak to us all the time go do
[1:25:54] this go do that say this say that and we
[1:25:57] did it didn't even think about it
[1:26:00] but somehow we loud allow that to get
[1:26:03] away from us
[1:26:05] but God is a promise
[1:26:07] he said I shall restore
[1:26:10] and all the gifts that you always used
[1:26:12] to have they're still there
[1:26:14] God is wanting to restore those things
[1:26:16] but you got to put yourself in a place
[1:26:18] where he can restore
[1:26:20] Hallelujah you got to become more
[1:26:22] serious you got to be more consecrated
[1:26:25] you got to be more uh considered
[1:26:28] considering of him and his will this is
[1:26:31] the will of God that he be seen
[1:26:35] in human flesh your flesh My Flesh
[1:26:42] Hallelujah
[1:26:44] thank you Jesus
[1:26:47] we don't understand
[1:26:49] you go to people I remember the time
[1:26:51] brother Simmons when we we go to
[1:26:53] people's house we talk that's all we
[1:26:54] talk about was Jesus
[1:26:56] we talked about the word that's all we
[1:26:58] knew to talk about
[1:27:00] we didn't take talk about football games
[1:27:02] basketball games and who's the famous
[1:27:04] stars and Beyonce and whatever
[1:27:09] we didn't care about the world
[1:27:12] the world had no it didn't even have no
[1:27:15] kind of attraction to us
[1:27:18] we were on the streets preaching
[1:27:21] singing that's where my first Pulpit was
[1:27:25] I don't even know where those people are
[1:27:27] that I baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:27:29] Jesus
[1:27:30] I don't care
[1:27:32] that's God's business
[1:27:34] can Philip baptize a eunuch
[1:27:37] I don't think he took Tab and said well
[1:27:39] he always remind me of where you are
[1:27:42] no
[1:27:46] no y'all hear me
[1:27:47] so what am I trying to say until we get
[1:27:51] to love Jesus so much that we could talk
[1:27:53] about him
[1:27:54] even to strangers
[1:27:57] that's what Malachi said he said if you
[1:28:00] talk about him he's got a book
[1:28:02] of remembrance
[1:28:05] talk to each other about him
[1:28:07] he's got a book
[1:28:09] every time you talk about him
[1:28:12] can I say it like this you get a perk
[1:28:16] you get a plus
[1:28:18] he writes it down
[1:28:22] he remembers it and he said when I come
[1:28:26] to gather my jewels and right now he's
[1:28:29] Gathering his jewels
[1:28:31] hallelujah oh my God
[1:28:35] what's the thing that's driving you
[1:28:37] whatever drives you is what you worship
[1:28:43] ah
[1:28:44] Hallelujah yep
[1:28:47] whatever driving you it is the thing
[1:28:50] that you are worshiping you call that
[1:28:53] demonic possession
[1:28:57] oh y'all don't got quiet
[1:28:59] because you know what the only thing
[1:29:01] that should be driving you or leading
[1:29:03] you is the Holy Ghost
[1:29:04] they that allowed alive are the spirit
[1:29:06] of God they are the sons of God
[1:29:09] Hallelujah when you when you really got
[1:29:12] God on the inside you understand that
[1:29:14] your sins has been forgiven
[1:29:17] and you know the devil said well you you
[1:29:19] ain't worthy enough to talk to nobody
[1:29:21] about Jesus yes I am
[1:29:23] there was a woman amen that talked to
[1:29:25] Jesus at the well
[1:29:27] she wasn't worthy at one point
[1:29:31] but when God gave her that water she ran
[1:29:34] to a city and said come see a man
[1:29:39] y'all hear what I'm saying when you know
[1:29:41] you covered by the blood you see
[1:29:44] yourself as God sees you
[1:29:47] Hallelujah you say how do God see me he
[1:29:50] see me perfect he see me Sanctified he
[1:29:54] see me holy that's the way I see me
[1:30:00] Hallelujah
[1:30:01] you say well what do you mean he took my
[1:30:03] penalty he took my death
[1:30:06] he took everything I was worthy I was
[1:30:09] worthy of death many many many times but
[1:30:12] God took it all
[1:30:14] with his stripes I am healed with the
[1:30:18] stripes you are healed let me tell you
[1:30:21] something if I came to you and I gave
[1:30:24] you a hundred dollars today you won't
[1:30:26] never forget me
[1:30:29] and God has given you more than a
[1:30:30] hundred dollar bill
[1:30:34] we so easy to forget him
[1:30:36] and he loves us still
[1:30:39] huh
[1:30:40] I heard somebody say you know me and my
[1:30:42] wife we have a practice when we have our
[1:30:44] Thanksgiving dinner
[1:30:46] that that last thing we do before
[1:30:48] everybody dismissed is that we stand up
[1:30:51] and everybody has to testify give a
[1:30:54] testimony whether you're a Christian or
[1:30:56] not if you're at my table you're going
[1:30:58] to give a testimony
[1:31:00] of what God has done for you during the
[1:31:02] year
[1:31:04] last year we we got caught up and we
[1:31:07] forgot and my wife and I we felt so
[1:31:09] condemned
[1:31:11] you say that's nutrition tradition no
[1:31:13] it's more than a tradition
[1:31:15] because my our hearts were in it and we
[1:31:18] wanted to thank God that we're thankful
[1:31:19] for that turkey
[1:31:21] oh y'all see some of y'all don't even
[1:31:22] know it but I came in a day that if you
[1:31:26] had a piece of chicken
[1:31:28] on Thanksgiving
[1:31:29] you was doing good
[1:31:34] but some of us we don't grew up in a
[1:31:35] generation we have turkey and ham we
[1:31:38] have all that stuff
[1:31:41] but in my day
[1:31:43] the best drink we could have had was
[1:31:45] Kool-Aid
[1:31:49] that's the way it was
[1:31:51] we weren't rich
[1:31:54] we didn't have the wealth of the wild
[1:31:55] but we had God
[1:31:57] we had a Praying Mother that new God
[1:32:02] y'all better hear what I'm saying I
[1:32:04] don't care I'd rather have nothing
[1:32:07] as long as I have Jesus
[1:32:10] and I don't say that to be saying it
[1:32:12] that is the real deal
[1:32:14] because at the end of the road they're
[1:32:16] going to take everything from you anyhow
[1:32:21] made free from sin
[1:32:23] God made us free and now we're the
[1:32:26] Servants of righteousness but we're so
[1:32:27] busy thinking about this flesh when God
[1:32:29] ain't worried about that God doesn't
[1:32:31] condemn sin in the flesh he wanted to
[1:32:33] see the Inner Man live
[1:32:35] that man that's in you he want to see
[1:32:37] that live
[1:32:39] Hallelujah would you ever have right
[1:32:42] yeah brother but you don't understand
[1:32:43] but I've got failures in my flesh I want
[1:32:45] somebody to raise their hand who don't
[1:32:47] have failures in their flesh
[1:32:50] and you're going to be like that to
[1:32:52] Jesus change it
[1:32:54] but that's not who you are
[1:32:58] amen it's what's on the inside
[1:33:01] and in a man is who you are and you got
[1:33:04] to perfect that you said Brotherhood
[1:33:06] this message is simple I trust is simple
[1:33:09] enough to bring something
[1:33:13] that's what we need we need we need
[1:33:14] Revival
[1:33:18] huh we need Revival I can remember I can
[1:33:21] remember the time even in this church
[1:33:22] amen what no you know the thing about a
[1:33:25] shouting dancing but most of all it
[1:33:28] wasn't it wasn't difficult to see tears
[1:33:31] when the last we've seen tears
[1:33:34] even in my church I do an altar call and
[1:33:37] the people come up for prayer they're
[1:33:39] not standing like this very seldom like
[1:33:42] this
[1:33:43] you pray for them like they I don't know
[1:33:45] what they want
[1:33:50] someone said like this laying on hands
[1:33:53] ain't gonna do you no good if you don't
[1:33:54] believe the word preached
[1:33:59] oh my
[1:34:00] oh my I guess I'm preaching like a
[1:34:01] pastor today and
[1:34:05] yes
[1:34:07] you got to choose your leader
[1:34:09] and your leader is life or death
[1:34:13] that's it
[1:34:14] I don't know what's wrong with the
[1:34:16] people but I think to myself if I could
[1:34:18] just say listen you don't know where
[1:34:20] death is
[1:34:23] man you could be healthy it's all get
[1:34:25] out
[1:34:26] and God will cause your heart to stop
[1:34:28] like that
[1:34:29] you got the juice now this is oh well I
[1:34:32] wait till I get older
[1:34:34] somebody said to me not long ago well I
[1:34:36] trust that the Rapture don't take place
[1:34:38] until I get married
[1:34:41] I said to myself I hope it don't take
[1:34:43] that long because you're not sure you're
[1:34:45] gonna get married
[1:34:51] I don't understand it
[1:34:53] When Heaven is going to give you
[1:34:55] everything you missed in this world
[1:34:58] everything
[1:35:01] you're not gonna get to heaven say oh I
[1:35:03] just wish I had this and wish I had no
[1:35:06] it won't be like that it'll be beyond
[1:35:10] anything you'll never miss this side of
[1:35:13] life
[1:35:16] you'll be so thankful God has delivered
[1:35:18] you from it
[1:35:20] Hallelujah
[1:35:21] like I tell people I said if I die Don't
[1:35:24] You Raise Me from the dead unless you
[1:35:25] got a thus said the Lord
[1:35:29] I believe you might have the power but
[1:35:32] don't you do it
[1:35:35] then I'm serious when I just struck at
[1:35:38] all this time to get this
[1:35:44] the first thing I want to probably say
[1:35:46] is like what do you want
[1:35:52] let me hurry up you I know you got
[1:35:55] things to do there but this is the thing
[1:35:58] this is the scripture that really
[1:35:59] inspired
[1:36:01] second chronicles please
[1:36:06] I hope you're being blessed this morning
[1:36:08] people of God I'm screaming
[1:36:11] because I see people who they've come so
[1:36:15] long and and and and and I know the
[1:36:17] Bible said these signs should follow
[1:36:19] them and say well we don't need all of
[1:36:21] that yes you do you need all of that
[1:36:23] it's like telling me an apple tree don't
[1:36:25] need apples yes you do
[1:36:28] don't tell me your Apple Tree and you
[1:36:29] can't produce no apples
[1:36:31] pear tree yeah I will prove
[1:36:34] and that's what Jesus won't he wants
[1:36:36] fruits of this message
[1:36:39] that we claim we follow
[1:36:42] second chronicles 15.
[1:36:45] 12 through 16. you know I've realized
[1:36:48] one thing I recognize one thing
[1:36:51] people say well don't judge me by the
[1:36:53] way you look but the way I look for your
[1:36:55] well I mean whatever you are inside
[1:36:59] is going to reflect the outside
[1:37:02] that's why I can tell people that don't
[1:37:04] have joy
[1:37:06] they got a lot of religion but they
[1:37:07] don't have that peace they don't have
[1:37:09] that Joy
[1:37:11] people getting wrinkles in their faces
[1:37:13] because they don't smile enough
[1:37:17] you know something's wrong with that
[1:37:20] how many of y'all remember when the Holy
[1:37:21] Ghost would be so much on us people
[1:37:23] could see the glory of God
[1:37:25] I'll be looking for that glow
[1:37:28] right I hope you look at me can you see
[1:37:31] the glow
[1:37:35] you just that's important to me I know
[1:37:38] it sounds like a joke but I really want
[1:37:41] people to see light
[1:37:43] you know how we can look Sometimes some
[1:37:44] of y'all spiritual you can see Darkness
[1:37:46] over people
[1:37:48] yeah I had to preach at my church the
[1:37:51] other day a few weeks ago
[1:37:53] here we had a special service on on
[1:37:56] Saturday and these brothers went out
[1:37:58] gathered together did some stuff that
[1:38:01] they shouldn't have been doing the Holy
[1:38:02] Ghost talking to me while I'm in the
[1:38:04] Pulpit see a lot of times when I tell
[1:38:06] them what God is telling me they think
[1:38:08] somebody done told me yeah somebody did
[1:38:10] it was Jesus Christ
[1:38:14] and then they all come in with that old
[1:38:16] nasty unclean Spirit hanging all over
[1:38:18] them and I'm preaching
[1:38:23] and I could have named them one by one
[1:38:28] and when I call the altar call
[1:38:31] only one man repented
[1:38:34] what's gonna happen to those people
[1:38:37] you understand me when God deliberately
[1:38:40] comes right there and shows you and tell
[1:38:44] you and talk to you and you let the
[1:38:46] devil reason it out
[1:38:49] y'all hear what I'm saying that's how it
[1:38:50] is brother Simmons coming I know he's a
[1:38:53] preacher
[1:38:54] I've seen discernment in this ministry
[1:38:57] there are times where we were at a place
[1:38:58] and I'm looking for the exit rather than
[1:39:00] trying to find a place to wait a way to
[1:39:03] get out because I'm thinking among these
[1:39:04] Apostolic people they're gonna Stone us
[1:39:09] I've seen him I'm not exalted the man
[1:39:11] I'm talking about the gift of the man
[1:39:14] I remember when I was in Africa he come
[1:39:16] right down the line with it
[1:39:19] and that church didn't repent and there
[1:39:22] were there more Darkness now than
[1:39:23] they've ever been
[1:39:25] the problem is you don't know what you
[1:39:28] got
[1:39:32] hmm
[1:39:34] he's not like other preachers
[1:39:36] and he never will be thank God
[1:39:40] and I'll be honest with you I'm so when
[1:39:42] I come here I feel comfortable
[1:39:48] see
[1:39:50] you can't love Jesus if you can't love
[1:39:52] your pastor
[1:39:55] show me y'all looking at me like I'm
[1:39:57] crazy
[1:39:57] but I'm gonna tell you something maybe
[1:39:59] you need to whoop you a little bit more
[1:40:03] you all done got to something
[1:40:07] crazy
[1:40:09] I'm telling you the truth
[1:40:12] you know you get children they get
[1:40:13] spoiled and then they get then they get
[1:40:15] disrespectful
[1:40:19] my last don't look at me now I'm telling
[1:40:21] you my my one daughter was 21 years old
[1:40:25] when she got her last whooping
[1:40:31] you live in my house you go by my rules
[1:40:35] you don't go by my rules you get whooped
[1:40:40] 21 year old or not if you want you grown
[1:40:43] get your own
[1:40:47] my sons know that too
[1:40:50] let me stop
[1:40:52] I might look soft until I get angry when
[1:40:54] you get
[1:40:55] let me move on I'm sorry forgive me Lord
[1:40:58] second chronicles 15.
[1:41:00] 12-16 this is my last scripture
[1:41:03] and they entered into a company you know
[1:41:06] what it's talking about Israel during
[1:41:08] the time of Asa
[1:41:10] and Asia amen means doctor or healer
[1:41:15] amen and you know you know every word
[1:41:19] means something
[1:41:20] one of the things you know I was just
[1:41:22] amazed and maybe I read it before but
[1:41:25] when I saw that Judah was the one that
[1:41:27] led the children out of the out of the
[1:41:29] the the Wilderness into Jordan
[1:41:32] that was the tribe and when I realized I
[1:41:35] said oh my God I said what's wrong with
[1:41:37] the people where's the praise
[1:41:41] where is the praise and let me tell you
[1:41:44] what I dislike I dislike when we've got
[1:41:47] to look at TV or look at some kind of
[1:41:49] thing on some kind of something to learn
[1:41:53] how to worship
[1:41:56] and then we try to pattern ourselves out
[1:41:58] that when God said
[1:42:00] they spit out of my face I've spit them
[1:42:03] out of my mouth
[1:42:05] that ain't what he wants
[1:42:08] if he wanted they meant you you to dance
[1:42:11] the way they do that he would he would
[1:42:13] incorporate the the nightclub
[1:42:19] huh I remember when brother Simmons said
[1:42:22] that to he said if God didn't excuse
[1:42:24] Elvis he ain't going to excuse you
[1:42:26] and you don't know what I deal with and
[1:42:27] I don't want to I deal with an African
[1:42:29] tribe there in my church and and I'm
[1:42:31] telling you they know how to move
[1:42:34] but they moving the wrong way
[1:42:36] hello
[1:42:37] they get mad with me and I use I don't
[1:42:40] say brother Simmons said
[1:42:43] but I used the same quote
[1:42:47] as if God ain't gonna excuse Elvis He
[1:42:49] showing us can they do worse than Elvis
[1:42:51] now I don't know what all Elvis did but
[1:42:52] I for what I've seen it ever do he can't
[1:42:55] compare to
[1:42:57] no that Rhythm oh man but anyway let me
[1:43:02] move on
[1:43:03] I'm coming down to the end of it
[1:43:06] there was a spirit and this was ASA ASA
[1:43:08] mother
[1:43:09] was an idolata
[1:43:12] she had to worship her
[1:43:14] and ASA when he did all God inspired him
[1:43:17] to do to Israel to bring them back to
[1:43:19] God
[1:43:21] he literally put her away
[1:43:26] now we know the story of Israel today
[1:43:28] they're here today and gone tomorrow
[1:43:30] they always are backsliding on God no
[1:43:33] matter what God did for them but they
[1:43:35] always had one solution
[1:43:37] turn back to God
[1:43:40] my people they which are called by thy
[1:43:42] name if they would humble themselves and
[1:43:45] pray and seek my face right humble
[1:43:48] yourself pray seek my face
[1:43:52] those are the steps that's all they had
[1:43:55] to do
[1:43:56] God said he would heal the land he would
[1:43:58] hear that prayer come and heal the land
[1:44:01] that's how it is now if you humble
[1:44:04] yourself seek his face and pray God will
[1:44:08] heal you God will restore your joy he'll
[1:44:11] restore your peace he'll restore your
[1:44:14] home let me say it like this whenever
[1:44:18] order is broken it brings chaos
[1:44:24] Adam and Eve broke the order it brought
[1:44:26] chaos whenever Israel broke the order it
[1:44:31] brought chaos
[1:44:32] is that right when Ezra when he when
[1:44:35] they broke David when he broke order
[1:44:37] bringing that that the Ark of the
[1:44:40] Covenant on the cart it brought chaos it
[1:44:44] brings death and you're wondering why
[1:44:46] churches are in church homes let me tell
[1:44:49] you like I said here before you want
[1:44:51] Revival in the church give me Revival in
[1:44:54] the home
[1:44:59] you know what that means Brothers you
[1:45:02] got to get in your place and sisters you
[1:45:04] got to get in yours
[1:45:09] as long as she's your head
[1:45:12] is chaos
[1:45:17] yeah it's true he became the head of
[1:45:21] Adam it brought chaos
[1:45:26] yeah that's the truth
[1:45:29] I don't care if she's
[1:45:31] she still must stay in her place
[1:45:35] oh I didn't hear Holly no amens from the
[1:45:37] women
[1:45:41] oh yeah and brothers you gotta help her
[1:45:45] demon I don't mean you you you puff your
[1:45:48] chest out and say wait a minute I'm the
[1:45:50] man no no no no no no there's more than
[1:45:52] that kind of a way you got to use some
[1:45:54] wisdom
[1:45:56] you use wisdom
[1:45:59] because let me tell you something about
[1:46:00] a woman most of the time when she get
[1:46:02] out of her place she's trying to help
[1:46:04] you
[1:46:06] brethren
[1:46:08] at least that's the way my wife is
[1:46:11] and oftentimes you know we take offense
[1:46:13] to it because of our Pride
[1:46:17] let me move on
[1:46:19] so here's the thing I don't know why I'm
[1:46:21] going the way I'm going God knows I
[1:46:24] trust somebody's being blessed
[1:46:26] but I'm trying to tell you I had some
[1:46:28] preacher from India tell me the last
[1:46:31] time I was here I met him at the hotel
[1:46:32] he said I'm a deep preacher
[1:46:38] I'm going over to brother so and so
[1:46:40] church and I'm a deep preacher I'll talk
[1:46:42] to myself I'm glad you're going over
[1:46:44] there
[1:46:48] you think you
[1:46:50] have long forgive me if I'm wrong I'm
[1:46:51] like okay you take your deep stuff and
[1:46:53] keep going
[1:46:55] you know what what is deep
[1:46:59] people don't even know what that means
[1:47:02] it was the Pharisees who were deep
[1:47:04] and that depth kind of took them in
[1:47:06] error
[1:47:08] they it had you know deep after a while
[1:47:10] you get so deep you interpret God's word
[1:47:13] the wrong way
[1:47:15] they were so deep they were blind
[1:47:17] Jesus was standing right there doing
[1:47:20] everything and they still call him a
[1:47:22] devil
[1:47:23] yes it's just the way it is now
[1:47:28] let me tell you something this is what
[1:47:30] has kept me nobody put me in nobody
[1:47:34] could take me out
[1:47:36] and when you know you to see the god
[1:47:41] nobody can't say to you well if you
[1:47:42] don't believe belong to this then you
[1:47:43] ain't part of it like are you serious
[1:47:47] really
[1:47:48] who gave you that Authority
[1:47:51] you've got to understand amen when God
[1:47:54] reveals to you who you are I don't care
[1:47:57] how messed up you are nobody can take
[1:48:00] that Revelation from you
[1:48:04] let them say what they want to say but
[1:48:07] why y'all criticizing me I'm gonna be
[1:48:09] enjoying Jesus
[1:48:11] you know what every time I do that I
[1:48:12] think about sister had it right she'd
[1:48:14] come in
[1:48:16] sister had had it right handy Jackson
[1:48:19] that's right they're about the same
[1:48:20] Hallelujah
[1:48:25] amen you love the Lord but look what he
[1:48:28] says in the 13th verse
[1:48:31] that whosoever would not see
[1:48:34] out of Israel
[1:48:36] shall be put today
[1:48:38] whether small
[1:48:40] or great where the man or woman let's go
[1:48:43] back up to the 12th verse and they
[1:48:45] entered into a covenant to seek the Lord
[1:48:48] God of their fathers with all their
[1:48:52] heart and with all their soul
[1:48:55] that whosoever would not seek the Lord
[1:48:58] with all their heart and with all their
[1:49:00] soul God a god of Israel shall be put to
[1:49:03] death whether small or great whether man
[1:49:07] or woman
[1:49:09] and they swear unto the Lord with a loud
[1:49:12] voice and with shouting and with
[1:49:15] trumpets and with Coronet you hear what
[1:49:18] I'm saying it was a Revival
[1:49:23] a Revival
[1:49:25] going on because there's ah we got the
[1:49:28] whole people that's willing to see God
[1:49:32] with all of their heart
[1:49:35] that after the word was opened
[1:49:38] the message desperation was preached in
[1:49:40] the prophet said like this he said if
[1:49:43] you do not fall into desperation if
[1:49:46] desperation don't strike you you're
[1:49:48] going to miss it
[1:49:51] president you must seek the Lord now
[1:49:54] with all of your heart with all of your
[1:49:58] soul with all of your mind it's hey
[1:50:01] we've had enough of the world
[1:50:04] oh it's the truth
[1:50:06] and I don't care let me say it like this
[1:50:08] and let me let me stop right here I I
[1:50:10] went totally a different way but God
[1:50:11] knows but let me show you one thing
[1:50:13] about covet I used to so love to eat I
[1:50:16] still do
[1:50:17] but nothing tastes the same
[1:50:19] anybody know what I'm talking about
[1:50:21] you can eat
[1:50:23] and it's just like something's missing
[1:50:26] right I get so disappointed because
[1:50:29] it'll smell so good
[1:50:31] but then when you start eating it it's
[1:50:32] not the same
[1:50:34] something has changed
[1:50:36] I don't know whether it's just in my
[1:50:38] case but alone I don't know
[1:50:41] but one thing I I do know the word of
[1:50:44] God has never changed
[1:50:47] it's still sweet as the honey in the
[1:50:49] cone it's still everything he was
[1:50:52] yesterday he is today
[1:50:55] but until we get in our hearts in mind
[1:50:58] that God is not looking for another
[1:51:00] church he's not looking for another
[1:51:03] group of people this is not a group
[1:51:05] effort anyway
[1:51:06] this is all individuals
[1:51:09] and it's more life than anything think
[1:51:12] about how easy Israel had it
[1:51:15] nobody had to do Miracles but Moses
[1:51:19] all they had to do was follow
[1:51:23] but when Joshua came on
[1:51:26] it was no longer a one-man Ministry
[1:51:29] Joshua says hey
[1:51:31] this whole Army we gonna March around
[1:51:35] this whole Army is a part of the
[1:51:38] ministry
[1:51:40] y'all better hear what I'm saying see
[1:51:42] that's the point
[1:51:43] the whole church is the ministry
[1:51:47] it's not just brother Simmons it's all
[1:51:50] of you
[1:51:51] but you gotta follow you got to join
[1:51:54] together and be one mind one a card
[1:51:58] to defeat the enemy y'all hear what I'm
[1:52:01] saying
[1:52:02] oh God have mercy on us
[1:52:06] I love Joshua
[1:52:08] Jehovah savior
[1:52:13] said all all I need you to do is just
[1:52:15] walk around Jericho
[1:52:18] seven times y'all know how that works
[1:52:21] he said when it's time for the blowing
[1:52:23] up the trumpet we're going to blow the
[1:52:25] trumpet and we're gonna watch out he
[1:52:28] didn't say the preacher gonna Shout
[1:52:29] out we ain't gonna shout let everybody
[1:52:31] shout everybody that's marching Shout
[1:52:38] what the victory
[1:52:40] did they had the fight
[1:52:43] God brought the walls down
[1:52:46] Hallelujah
[1:52:48] and you must understand today if you
[1:52:51] want God to to to to to to Really bless
[1:52:54] you
[1:52:55] you got to follow the leader Paul said
[1:52:58] follow me as I follow Christ
[1:53:01] don't complain you'll be like Moses
[1:53:04] let me you'll be like the children of
[1:53:05] Israel with Moses I forgot to bring one
[1:53:07] more thought one more thought please
[1:53:09] just one more thought
[1:53:10] his mother
[1:53:12] her name was Marca
[1:53:14] and Marca means oppression
[1:53:17] it means to pull down depress
[1:53:22] when you're worn you know wore out it
[1:53:25] means to fasten and that's where a lot
[1:53:28] of people are now you fastened you've
[1:53:32] been depressed oppressed and whatever
[1:53:35] more
[1:53:36] but you ain't telling nobody
[1:53:37] because your religion is covering you
[1:53:40] you don't have the joy that you used to
[1:53:42] have
[1:53:43] that's marker
[1:53:45] because you've left God
[1:53:47] you need to return to him
[1:53:50] Hallelujah that's the only way you're
[1:53:52] going to get your joy back
[1:53:54] that's the only way you're going to have
[1:53:55] that shouting account you got to be
[1:53:58] willing to follow God with all of your
[1:54:00] heart ASA said you my mama but you got
[1:54:03] to go
[1:54:05] Hallelujah we don't need depression in
[1:54:08] this church
[1:54:11] we don't need oppression in this church
[1:54:14] we need Joy
[1:54:16] so that when a non-believer come in here
[1:54:18] they can see God is in the camp
[1:54:21] but when they come in here and they see
[1:54:22] people just as sad as they are how
[1:54:25] you're going to give them something when
[1:54:26] there's nothing you can give them
[1:54:28] Hallelujah
[1:54:30] that's what God wants
[1:54:33] he said uh he said uh he told that woman
[1:54:36] at the well
[1:54:37] I'll give you water
[1:54:39] it's bringing up to life is that right
[1:54:42] now let me tell you something
[1:54:46] when she ran to the city she didn't run
[1:54:48] with a cup
[1:54:50] she dropped the buckets
[1:54:52] because she became the whale
[1:54:57] y'all better hear what I'm saying see
[1:54:59] when the real Holy Ghost is in you you
[1:55:01] become the well
[1:55:05] huh people are thirsting and hungering
[1:55:07] for God
[1:55:09] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:55:11] there's no no driving force like a
[1:55:13] thirst
[1:55:14] thirsting and hungry for God
[1:55:17] and you're the wow

[1:55:42] Counseling of God
