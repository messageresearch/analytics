[50:34] believe under this atmosphere anything
[50:36] can happen
[50:38] God dwells in the Praises of his people
[50:41] I want to thank our pastor for giving me
[50:44] this opportunities privilege to stand
[50:46] before you ministering the word of the
[50:48] Lord and I want to thank my brother and
[50:51] I we are meeting for the first time and
[50:53] here we've been seeing each other we've
[50:55] been talking online and sister mature
[50:58] and all of you are here may the Lord
[51:01] bless you I'm from Zimbabwe I'm Pastor
[51:03] I'm doctor because in the medical I ran
[51:07] my surgery is about four surgeries
[51:09] then in the spiritual I've been planting
[51:13] churches when you talk of medical that's
[51:16] who professionally I am but when you
[51:20] talk of missionary that's who I am
[51:22] that is see how it's been saying that in
[51:25] the body I may be tired I think um I
[51:28] came with my family this time but I left
[51:30] them in Florida you know sometimes you
[51:33] have to balance Ministry and family so
[51:36] that you don't in the whole world and
[51:39] lose your children
[51:40] so we're to just have a good time in
[51:43] Florida even Disneyland and places
[51:47] last weekend I was ministering in UK and
[51:52] the previous I think Wednesday I was in
[51:55] ministering in Dubai then the other
[51:58] weekend I was in Canada
[52:00] so it's definitely from traveling I've
[52:03] been a bit worn out but I feel like
[52:05] traveling on
[52:07] I do think our pasta and um we'll open
[52:10] our Bible to the book of hakai I don't
[52:13] want to keep you along I'll just think
[52:16] 45 minutes should be good enough for us
[52:18] and
[52:20] [Music]
[52:20] um
[52:22] we see how the Lord takes over
[52:24] when we Minister it's not actually us
[52:27] ministering is God coming down to speak
[52:30] to his people there is a scripture in
[52:32] the Bible that says when the god when
[52:35] the when the tepanic was dedicated the
[52:37] crowd of Glory came down until the
[52:39] ministers failed to minister because of
[52:42] the presence of God
[52:44] I know each one of you have different
[52:46] needs and desires may God come down and
[52:49] prove that is the same yesterday today
[52:51] and forever
[52:53] I just learned it a few minutes ago from
[52:55] Florida because when I I was here I
[52:57] think it was yesterday but one or
[53:00] yesterday uh time difference is making a
[53:03] difference
[53:04] so I flew back to join my family and
[53:07] then I I'm flew in this morning as soon
[53:11] as I finish from the last cold place
[53:13] where I'll be in the at the airport to
[53:15] join my family again right
[53:18] we are doing missionary work at home and
[53:21] um about 20 of our churches have church
[53:24] stands and we believe we'll build even
[53:27] in trouble as times and make impact you
[53:32] know will be mortal once and I believe
[53:35] when you give to the Lord you'll never
[53:38] lose
[53:39] I will open from Hawkeye
[53:42] um
[53:42] chapter I'll open chapter two
[53:46] verse 15. says I pray you
[53:50] consider from this day upwards
[53:52] before the stone was laid a stone in the
[53:56] temple of the Lord I'll skip to verse
[53:58] 18. consider now from this day upwards
[54:01] from the 24th day of the ninth month
[54:04] even the day the foundation of the
[54:07] Lord's Temple was laid considered I'll
[54:10] escape to verse 20 and again the word of
[54:14] the Lord came to Akai in the 24th day of
[54:18] the month
[54:20] um I'll go to verse 23. in that day he
[54:23] said the Lord of hosts I will take self
[54:25] Propel my servant the son of shitail and
[54:29] say the Lord and I'll make him a
[54:31] sickness
[54:32] for I've chosen thee save the Lord of
[54:34] hosts let us pray our heavenly father we
[54:36] come to the service into our hands let
[54:38] the Holy Spirit come in a mighty way to
[54:41] send the needs of your people remove all
[54:44] their burdens as the Bible says the
[54:46] yorkship is destroyed because of the
[54:47] anointing that Holy Spirit father answer
[54:50] every unspoken need in unspoken desires
[54:53] father may he be that father will say
[54:55] from this day upwards something has
[54:57] happened in our lives
[54:59] that our Holy Ghost father so annoying
[55:01] to your people that all their burdens
[55:04] will be broken during the preaching of
[55:05] the word as the Bible says while Peter
[55:07] had Speck they were filled with holy
[55:10] spirit that everyone father never did
[55:11] the same father may all sicknesses be
[55:14] broken may you come and prove that you
[55:16] are the same yesterday to end forever
[55:18] and you specialize in things not
[55:21] impossible May that power of
[55:23] transformation come Lord father and
[55:25] attend to everyone who is who is saying
[55:28] enough is enough I'm sick and tired of
[55:30] this situation may the same Jesus come
[55:33] Lord father and prove that is a present
[55:35] help in time of need and when your
[55:37] people and fight their battles raise
[55:39] them to new platforming new Spears in
[55:42] that spiritual way they shall know you
[55:44] better Lord father in The Power of your
[55:46] Resurrection in Jesus name I pray amen
[55:48] right to represented
[55:52] I usually preach with my PowerPoint and
[55:55] my slides but I thought
[55:57] um
[55:58] when I was coming I thought maybe the
[56:00] airlines will keep changing the times
[56:02] you know when I was traveling back they
[56:05] kept changing the time so I thought I
[56:07] only have time to set up anything so my
[56:09] subject today is from the scripture
[56:11] there it says consider from this day
[56:13] upwards where we see in the Bible it
[56:17] happened that on the 24th day of the
[56:19] ninth month that's when God says he
[56:21] takes his seven sirupa Bell and it
[56:24] happens actually to be the day when God
[56:27] took our prophet
[56:29] but he says I will take the rubber bill
[56:31] in the last verse say he says I will
[56:32] take you and make a Signet a powerful
[56:35] Authority so it was a ninth month
[56:39] is December to Israel because April is
[56:43] the first month
[56:45] so the 24th day of the ninth month is 24
[56:48] December to us because April is the
[56:53] first month you come from April in
[56:55] Israel so here he's saying I will take
[56:58] my servant then but he says consider
[57:01] from this day upwards so God takes his
[57:04] servant but he says consider from this
[57:07] day upwards in other words
[57:10] um in verse 20 there let's go to verse
[57:14] three okay he says who is left among you
[57:16] who has seen this house in a first glory
[57:18] and how do we see it now is it not in
[57:20] your eyes in comparison as nothing
[57:22] so looking at your life and your ought
[57:25] to be condition looking at your life and
[57:27] the promise of the hour looking at your
[57:29] life and the message is it not in
[57:32] comparison as nothing
[57:34] so your starting point it may look like
[57:37] you have not reached these fears and
[57:39] dimensions and channels spots where you
[57:42] want to live as a Christian but God who
[57:45] has the power to restore is saying the
[57:47] glory of the latter house
[57:49] shall exceed out of the former now he
[57:52] takes his servant then on the 24th day
[57:55] of the ninth month which is 24 December
[57:58] but now it says consider from that day
[58:01] apart
[58:02] this message is continuous this message
[58:06] is Unstoppable when God took Christ
[58:10] he says greater work shall you do
[58:12] because that which Christ was doing is
[58:15] continued after his taken when God took
[58:19] Moses he says I was with Moses so shall
[58:24] I be with Joshua so the message was
[58:27] Unstoppable because when he took Moses
[58:30] he did not take away the pillar of fire
[58:32] it did not take away the count of Glory
[58:34] so God is still here today doing the
[58:38] same he is the same yesterday today and
[58:41] forever meaning your life cannot be the
[58:44] same yesterday today and forever that
[58:47] same God can come out of the patches of
[58:49] the Bible to meet you today he can come
[58:52] out of this spoken word he can come out
[58:54] of the sermon he can come out of your
[58:57] dream of that inspiration he can come
[58:59] out of the anointing he can come out of
[59:02] the atmosphere to be a present help in
[59:05] your life it's not enough to carry the
[59:07] Bible without the god of the Bible it's
[59:10] not enough to have the spoken word
[59:12] without the god of the spoken word it's
[59:15] not enough to have the books and
[59:16] attempts without the god that books and
[59:19] attempts that same God must prove
[59:21] himself so that you know him in the
[59:23] power of his resurrection
[59:25] I've seen that God opened the eyes of
[59:28] the blind during preaching I've seen
[59:31] Lambs disappearing I've actually repair
[59:34] referred patience for my surgery to
[59:38] church some conditions that I failed to
[59:40] handle at the century we end with them
[59:43] at the altar in that same God I've seen
[59:46] him restore even marriages that were
[59:48] broken where brother and sister were
[59:50] were divorced for 20 years in their
[59:53] sweethearts today
[59:55] so he says the starting point it's in
[59:58] your eyes in comparison is nothing when
[1:00:01] you look at your life in broken pieces
[1:00:03] God is able to take broken pieces and
[1:00:06] make something beautiful and something
[1:00:08] very good in your life it says I will
[1:00:11] write this tale again
[1:00:13] so we should see a progress
[1:00:16] of the spoken word in our lives
[1:00:19] this message is not a museum to say 1963
[1:00:23] this happened 1965 this happened but the
[1:00:26] same thing is happening today
[1:00:28] the same power of the message now the
[1:00:31] book of Acts did not end with amen or
[1:00:34] other books ends in the New Testament
[1:00:36] end with amen but the book of Acts ends
[1:00:40] as if to be continued
[1:00:42] the last amen will be the last testimony
[1:00:45] in the pride when the last one comes in
[1:00:48] and we give the amen recall so whatever
[1:00:51] happened in the book of Acts must be
[1:00:54] happening what the church here did
[1:00:55] Pentecost is the standard it's right so
[1:01:00] we must see the same power same Holy
[1:01:04] Spirit same testimonies same special
[1:01:06] Miracles same holiness
[1:01:09] so if in the book of Acts they would
[1:01:12] cast out Devils we cast out Devils if in
[1:01:15] the book of Acts they will live holy we
[1:01:17] live holy it's in the book of Acts that
[1:01:19] special Miracles we have special
[1:01:21] miracles in the book of Acts if they
[1:01:23] have Apostles and fivefold Ministry we
[1:01:26] have the fivefold ministry so the same
[1:01:29] is continuing the same God is in coming
[1:01:32] in power and continuing when Elijah was
[1:01:36] taken up
[1:01:37] consider from that day onwards
[1:01:41] the same power that was in Elijah was
[1:01:43] now in Elijah
[1:01:45] being a continuation of the Elijah
[1:01:48] Ministry he could not be a continuation
[1:01:51] of a miracle that he was not humble
[1:01:54] saving under
[1:01:55] he was pouring water in the hands of
[1:01:59] Elijah he served under that Ministry
[1:02:02] then he became a continuation so as soon
[1:02:06] as Elijah was taken the same power in
[1:02:10] that proportion was seen in Elijah
[1:02:13] actually the last miracle of Elijah is
[1:02:18] the first miracle of Elisha the opening
[1:02:21] of Jordan River
[1:02:22] so he started exactly where Elijah left
[1:02:26] so it became a continuation
[1:02:29] actually Hebrews 11 Saints and their
[1:02:32] testimonies the Bible says they without
[1:02:35] us are not perfect meaning that our
[1:02:39] testimony is in the quality of Miracles
[1:02:41] and walk with God must exceed that of
[1:02:44] Hebrews level
[1:02:45] if under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:02:48] they will say sun stand still and sun
[1:02:50] stands under the blood of bulls and
[1:02:53] goats they will shut the mouth of lions
[1:02:55] and the Bible says out of weakness they
[1:02:58] were made strong it means your testimony
[1:03:01] must be higher than that under the blood
[1:03:03] of Jesus Christ the anointing that
[1:03:06] operates in your life must be higher
[1:03:07] than that and I'm clear that that same
[1:03:10] Jesus is here to meet you if you have a
[1:03:13] situation in your life that looks
[1:03:15] impossible while we are preaching the
[1:03:17] word May the power of God touch you and
[1:03:19] answer you and bring Total Restoration
[1:03:22] of what the devil stall in your life let
[1:03:25] it come back again so Christ says great
[1:03:28] awake shall you do where he finished
[1:03:30] disciples continued from there when God
[1:03:33] finished the creation Adam continued
[1:03:36] from there naming the animals
[1:03:39] saying and when he says this is an
[1:03:41] elephant God said amen
[1:03:43] whatever he named that animal that's
[1:03:46] what the animal became
[1:03:48] that is the power that we have as a
[1:03:50] child of God that whatever you call
[1:03:52] your situation that's what it shall be
[1:03:55] if you say I'm Healed that's what it
[1:03:58] shall be if you say I'm free that's what
[1:04:00] it shall be if you say I shall come out
[1:04:03] of this your life will go the direction
[1:04:06] of your words
[1:04:07] when you speak you know what God is
[1:04:10] that's what we are in a measure
[1:04:13] if God is God we are amateur God if God
[1:04:17] is light we are light if God is the king
[1:04:21] he has made us Kings if God is a priest
[1:04:24] he has met us priests if God whatever he
[1:04:28] is we are a chip of the old block
[1:04:31] if he is the Messiah he has made us
[1:04:33] Messiah
[1:04:35] God has put something in in us that will
[1:04:39] meet the challenge of the hour and I
[1:04:41] know there are potentials loaded in your
[1:04:43] life I'm only coming with jumpers to
[1:04:45] jumpstart that power
[1:04:47] into manifestation so that you don't
[1:04:49] live in underprivileged life but know
[1:04:52] that you are born for such a time as
[1:04:54] this born to do exploits our ought to be
[1:04:58] condition is when we do it to do
[1:05:00] exploits to be a Powerhouse not a pest
[1:05:03] house a Christian is loaded with
[1:05:06] potentials and blessings that your
[1:05:08] situation is too low for you the devil
[1:05:11] must not know what is happening in your
[1:05:12] life you must only know the size of your
[1:05:14] shoe and he must only be under your feet
[1:05:16] that is his own position you must not
[1:05:19] know what is happening in your marriage
[1:05:21] in your finances but you must only know
[1:05:23] to be under your feet that is the
[1:05:26] position of a Believer with dominion and
[1:05:29] adoption when you are in your spiritual
[1:05:31] rank as a Believer God's agenda in our
[1:05:34] life is to restore us
[1:05:36] when he met men many in Genesis chapter
[1:05:39] 1 verse 26 yet Dominion offered the
[1:05:43] fowls of the air
[1:05:45] and over the beasts of the land and over
[1:05:48] the the fish of the sea that's why when
[1:05:51] our Prophet comes you will demonstrate
[1:05:54] that dominion over the flying things and
[1:05:57] say bees go back to your place you will
[1:06:00] come to the fish of the sea and say
[1:06:02] little fish I give you life you come to
[1:06:05] the Beast of the land they say bull go
[1:06:07] back to your place that's why in
[1:06:09] Revelation chapter 10 that Mighty Angel
[1:06:11] demonstrate that Dominion with Heavenly
[1:06:14] powers and he put his foot on the sea
[1:06:23] that is the power that you have to
[1:06:26] control atmospheres
[1:06:28] to rule and govern as a son and daughter
[1:06:31] of God
[1:06:32] it's not that we shall have that power
[1:06:34] in the Millennium right now we have it
[1:06:37] that right now we shall exercise it
[1:06:39] people believe that we shall have that
[1:06:42] power more in this quiz correct but if
[1:06:45] the devil has squeezed you now show that
[1:06:47] power
[1:06:48] you have already been squeezed
[1:06:49] financially prematurely you've been been
[1:06:52] squeezed in your health use the Deadpool
[1:06:55] manifestation to speak to your mountain
[1:06:58] and your Mountain shall hear you
[1:07:00] remember your situation here's your
[1:07:03] voice
[1:07:04] if the trip on his head
[1:07:06] your situation hears if the mountain had
[1:07:09] your situation hears if the sun had and
[1:07:14] the moon ahead your situation here today
[1:07:17] it's a speaking service everyone will
[1:07:20] speak to the amounted and you shall see
[1:07:22] the results of the power of God so the
[1:07:26] book of Moses it is written in the Books
[1:07:29] of Moses that Moses died
[1:07:32] and the Book of Moses continue a bit
[1:07:35] after the death of Moses
[1:07:37] in the book of Samuel is written that
[1:07:39] Samuel died in the books of Samuel
[1:07:43] continue after the death of Samia so
[1:07:46] this message after the prophet messenger
[1:07:48] is gone
[1:07:50] there is no way where he says he's no
[1:07:52] longer here the angel is still here God
[1:07:55] has empowered their people and he says
[1:07:58] if the people shall the pride shall know
[1:08:00] who she is
[1:08:03] you can only know who you are by knowing
[1:08:06] who he is
[1:08:09] now the pride knows who the prophet is
[1:08:12] they know
[1:08:14] more about what God can do but they
[1:08:17] don't know who they are
[1:08:19] you shall know as you are known in
[1:08:21] heaven
[1:08:22] it's a perfect picture in heaven is what
[1:08:25] God is coming to restore in your life
[1:08:28] when you look at the perfect picture and
[1:08:30] that picture in your life now is it not
[1:08:33] in your eyes in comparison as nothing
[1:08:36] when you look at who God has called you
[1:08:39] to be and what you are now but I know
[1:08:42] you have this testimony that you are not
[1:08:44] what you should be yet you are not what
[1:08:47] you used to be
[1:08:49] every day you're getting better and
[1:08:52] better and I believe we move in line
[1:08:55] with the quotations and scriptures of
[1:08:57] our time
[1:08:58] if in 1960s
[1:09:01] our Prophet says there is a power that
[1:09:04] is coming into the church and now it's
[1:09:05] coming in that God will show annoying
[1:09:08] people that they will speak the word
[1:09:09] into flash like lightning
[1:09:12] I believe now that power we are already
[1:09:14] needs because it can't be future forever
[1:09:17] if he says the church is moving into a
[1:09:21] sphere right now
[1:09:22] that it was going to shut the whole
[1:09:24] world that church shall not be forever
[1:09:27] moving into a sphere
[1:09:28] they should be in that sphere now
[1:09:31] if he says the church is moving is
[1:09:34] living a million miles below their
[1:09:38] privileges
[1:09:39] let's say he says that in the 50s and
[1:09:42] 60s
[1:09:43] by now we can't be a million miles
[1:09:46] otherwise we are not responding we can't
[1:09:49] be a million miles now if we have not
[1:09:52] reached there maybe we are in we have a
[1:09:54] mileage that we can cover this service
[1:09:56] to reach our privileges what I'm saying
[1:10:00] is that it shall not be future always
[1:10:02] one day you shall step into what you
[1:10:05] have believed one day you shall
[1:10:07] experience what you are born to be you
[1:10:10] are here for a purpose and there are not
[1:10:12] enough devils in hell to stop you from
[1:10:14] being what God saw you becoming and God
[1:10:17] will release the anointing to Aid you to
[1:10:20] reach those levels in those fears life
[1:10:22] was in prayer life was in consecration
[1:10:24] levels in living right until the death
[1:10:27] is a mere spectator in your life the
[1:10:30] Devi has no chance financially spiritual
[1:10:32] in all directions of your life you are
[1:10:35] prevailing against all forces of evil
[1:10:39] so there is a continuation the Bible
[1:10:41] says consider from this day upwards in
[1:10:45] Revelation chapter 5
[1:10:47] John is whipping
[1:10:49] saying no man could open the book The
[1:10:52] Abstract title Deeds of redemption
[1:10:55] Johnny is crying because he knows he
[1:10:57] wants to reach a certain level
[1:10:59] he knows that when that book is opened
[1:11:02] his answers are coming now we've opened
[1:11:05] this book and I believe your answers are
[1:11:07] coming when the book was opened there
[1:11:09] was praise when the book of the of the
[1:11:12] word of God is open Let There Be praise
[1:11:14] in your life
[1:11:16] now when John was weeping
[1:11:18] he didn't know that the line is already
[1:11:21] prevailed
[1:11:22] when you are crying about your
[1:11:24] circumstances you don't know that God
[1:11:26] has already answered
[1:11:28] your answer is older than your problem
[1:11:32] before you were in that situation there
[1:11:34] was already a scripture somewhere there
[1:11:37] was already a quotation somewhere there
[1:11:40] was already the anointing somewhere
[1:11:42] there was already a power somewhere to
[1:11:45] take you out of that situation and the
[1:11:47] reason why you desire to come out of
[1:11:49] that situation is because there is a
[1:11:52] deep calling to a dip
[1:11:54] the reason why of that desire is because
[1:11:56] there is a power somewhere that can
[1:11:58] answer that desire so your answer is
[1:12:02] older than your problem when John was
[1:12:04] weeping it was already done
[1:12:08] because Angels speak prophetically
[1:12:11] when the angel says the Elder says the
[1:12:15] lion head already prevailed when the
[1:12:18] book was still closed when your
[1:12:21] situation is still looking impossible
[1:12:22] God is already prevailed
[1:12:25] I read in the Bible how Angels speak
[1:12:28] prophetically in Revelation chapter 14
[1:12:32] the angel says Papillon is Fallen
[1:12:36] then chapter 18 chapter 17 we see
[1:12:39] Babylon is moving around
[1:12:41] actually becoming more mysterious
[1:12:43] mystery Papillon
[1:12:44] when the engine says Patron is falling
[1:12:46] it becomes even more mysterious
[1:12:49] when we say your sickness is gone and it
[1:12:51] becomes more mysterious
[1:12:53] it's just because the next chapter
[1:12:56] people be saying alas in one hour
[1:12:59] Babylon is falling
[1:13:01] Allah it was declared before and what we
[1:13:05] did shall materialize the blessing that
[1:13:08] we declare upon your life one day shall
[1:13:11] be your personal property
[1:13:14] your Victory spiritually we declare your
[1:13:17] victory in your marriage we declare your
[1:13:19] victory in your health we declare your
[1:13:21] victory in your dreams we declare your
[1:13:23] victory in your children we declare your
[1:13:25] Victory academically in your paperwork
[1:13:27] in your permits in your documents let
[1:13:30] God answer in every direction of your
[1:13:33] life
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:36] that is the code of the message
[1:13:38] when you are associated with this
[1:13:40] message your life becomes Supernatural
[1:13:43] and it's naturally Supernatural meaning
[1:13:46] the Miracles become a regular routine
[1:13:49] now John was weeping because there was a
[1:13:53] crisis in heaven
[1:13:55] the one who sorted the crisis in heaven
[1:13:57] can sort the crisis in your life
[1:14:01] when no pop or bishop or Pastor or any
[1:14:06] Angel could answer that one man was
[1:14:09] Worthy
[1:14:10] when people could not help you there is
[1:14:12] someone who can help you but look at
[1:14:14] this your answer is older than you your
[1:14:17] problem when John was weeping the answer
[1:14:20] was already there when that woman when
[1:14:23] women were going to anoint Christ we're
[1:14:26] crying that who shall roll this turn
[1:14:29] they didn't know that his turn is
[1:14:31] already rolled
[1:14:32] those who are going to a mouse were
[1:14:34] crying walking with their answer crying
[1:14:38] working with their solution crying when
[1:14:41] you are carrying the message in the
[1:14:43] Bible you are working with your answer
[1:14:44] complaining but when their eyes were
[1:14:47] opened
[1:14:49] what opened their eyes was a
[1:14:51] continuation of the words of Christ when
[1:14:54] Christ did
[1:14:55] what he did before he died
[1:14:58] breaking the bread
[1:15:01] their eyes opened and today if God does
[1:15:04] something that he did when he was
[1:15:06] working in Galilee when he was working
[1:15:08] in in Jeffersonville
[1:15:10] our Prophet actually says Christ was
[1:15:13] more successful in Jeffersonville
[1:15:15] because of the Greater Works let me say
[1:15:18] Christ seems to be also more successful
[1:15:20] in Colombia in in in in South Carolina
[1:15:23] because of the Greater Works where you
[1:15:27] can even impact life where even missing
[1:15:31] limbs shall be restored now if missing
[1:15:34] limbs can be restored what more limbs
[1:15:36] that are there that just need healing
[1:15:40] now if God
[1:15:42] remove the weight of your sins
[1:15:45] he can remove the lamp from your body
[1:15:49] if God paid the debt
[1:15:51] that you could not even attempt to pay
[1:15:54] you can pay other debts in your life
[1:15:58] if it takes
[1:16:00] a a mustard seed a very small seed like
[1:16:04] that to move a mountain
[1:16:06] you need a fraction of that to move your
[1:16:08] problem
[1:16:11] if it takes part
[1:16:15] a millionth of a second in a moment in
[1:16:18] the think of an eye
[1:16:19] to change your entire body
[1:16:22] it takes him less than that to remove
[1:16:25] cancer from your body
[1:16:28] I've seen I've yet many testimonies
[1:16:34] during preaching and I believe today
[1:16:36] something special
[1:16:38] happen in your life
[1:16:41] brother we must become what we came to
[1:16:44] be
[1:16:45] in this message we we believe and we
[1:16:47] know that we are the super race final
[1:16:50] voice one in a million but as one in a
[1:16:53] million things are not moving in your
[1:16:55] life
[1:16:55] it's final voice things are not moving
[1:16:57] in your life you are struggling as the
[1:17:00] final voice but what you believe what
[1:17:03] you decree about yourself must one day
[1:17:06] match the happenings
[1:17:08] that's why the Bible is saying consider
[1:17:10] from this day upwards there is an
[1:17:13] experience that can happen that can turn
[1:17:16] around the tables there is two things
[1:17:18] that God does with tables some of them
[1:17:21] he prepares them in the presence of the
[1:17:23] enemies but sometimes he turns the
[1:17:26] tables when things are not moving if you
[1:17:28] are statement spiritual financially they
[1:17:31] shall be movement consider from this day
[1:17:34] upwards
[1:17:35] Moses yet try this purpose without the
[1:17:39] anointing but when he met the burning
[1:17:42] bush consider from that day upwards
[1:17:46] the most it was running away from
[1:17:48] Pharaoh now yet the fire in him he went
[1:17:52] to meet what he was running away from
[1:17:54] when disciples were running away from
[1:17:56] Pharisees and they locked themselves in
[1:17:59] the upper room when the Holy Ghost came
[1:18:01] down consider from that day upwards they
[1:18:04] went out looking for the Pharisees and
[1:18:07] said you Pharisees with Wicked hands
[1:18:09] crucified they were not fearing anymore
[1:18:12] now because the fire in them was more
[1:18:15] than the fire outside when they were
[1:18:17] boiled in Drums of oil like John the oil
[1:18:20] in them was more than the oil outside
[1:18:22] when they put in Lion's Den like Daniel
[1:18:25] the lion in them was more than the lying
[1:18:28] outside when they put in the fire
[1:18:30] furnace like shutting me check the fire
[1:18:32] in the Moss more than the far outside
[1:18:34] when they face the Giants like David the
[1:18:38] Giant in them was more than the child
[1:18:40] outside Creator is he that is within you
[1:18:43] than the one in the world
[1:18:47] we have to become the message
[1:18:49] what silences critics is not when you
[1:18:52] you you bring arguments but when your
[1:18:56] life proves that Jesus is Alive
[1:18:59] when your testimony when you save the
[1:19:03] same results that they are they're
[1:19:04] arguing about they see that same
[1:19:07] testimony knew that's what silence is
[1:19:09] the critics when the god of the Bible
[1:19:11] comes
[1:19:12] so in Revelation chapter 5 when John the
[1:19:17] same spot where he was crying
[1:19:19] in a few seconds that same spot you as
[1:19:22] rejoicing
[1:19:23] he says everything on Earth help me say
[1:19:27] you honor and Glory the same place where
[1:19:29] you are crying you shall rejoice in that
[1:19:32] same oh brother
[1:19:34] that chapter five
[1:19:37] started with pain and sorrow and tears
[1:19:40] of pain
[1:19:41] and it ended with the tears of joy
[1:19:44] the same service there is a before and
[1:19:47] after
[1:19:48] what you wear before the service and
[1:19:51] what you are after the service
[1:19:53] our good specializes in things that
[1:19:56] impossible if you have any rivers that
[1:19:59] you think unprossable and any mountain
[1:20:01] that you cannot turn it through our God
[1:20:03] is here for those mountains
[1:20:07] I've seen God changing Track Addicts
[1:20:10] to become message addicts
[1:20:13] I'm an attic to myself I can't live
[1:20:16] without the word
[1:20:17] I always want to be a bit High you know
[1:20:19] a Higher Ground a higher plane that I
[1:20:22] found every day brother I want to just
[1:20:25] get a dose of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:27] the message is so powerful that you
[1:20:29] don't need this whole container just a
[1:20:31] lead of quotations
[1:20:32] you'll be high
[1:20:34] you'll be already shouting Victory you
[1:20:38] know a drunk man does not see problems
[1:20:40] he's a part of the problems when I'm
[1:20:43] drunk with the spirit I'm a part of the
[1:20:45] situation
[1:20:46] uh our God is the Practical God
[1:20:50] that God must be seen in our services
[1:20:53] every time must be seen in our marriages
[1:20:56] in our children it's not a talk that we
[1:21:00] are we are better than denominations
[1:21:02] it's something that must be seen
[1:21:05] it's the people who said these are
[1:21:08] Christians because they saw Christ in
[1:21:11] them
[1:21:12] it's the people who say the spirit of
[1:21:15] Elijah now rest on Elijah is the people
[1:21:19] in denominations who say surely these
[1:21:22] are the people
[1:21:23] it's not us saying we are the best we
[1:21:25] are something must speak for you
[1:21:28] that same God
[1:21:30] the devil is so cheap in your life that
[1:21:32] he has no access
[1:21:33] when you when you leave that life is so
[1:21:36] close to God the devil becomes a mere
[1:21:39] spectator
[1:21:40] the devil is so cheap
[1:21:42] that when he wants to attack you he asks
[1:21:44] for permission from God
[1:21:46] the devil is so cheap that he has no
[1:21:49] keys to his home the bottom of speed the
[1:21:52] Angeles keys to the bottle of spit the
[1:21:55] devil is so cheap that he knows his time
[1:21:59] is short
[1:22:00] he's so cheap that he walks like a
[1:22:02] roaring lion but he's not a lion he's a
[1:22:04] liar
[1:22:06] the team is so cheap that with a finger
[1:22:09] of God not a hand we cast out devils
[1:22:13] they tell me so cheap that when the
[1:22:15] weakest of creatures
[1:22:17] pray there is confusion in hell
[1:22:21] not when we are in the center for our
[1:22:23] prayers
[1:22:24] when we are start when we are busy
[1:22:26] creating God our Father already there is
[1:22:28] confusion in hell
[1:22:30] now brother
[1:22:31] to for you to be not tossed to and from
[1:22:35] to be unshaken even in shaking times you
[1:22:38] need that experience where you can say
[1:22:41] consider from this day upwards
[1:22:45] I believe
[1:22:46] when David finished
[1:22:48] the Mighty Men of David continued
[1:22:52] those men who came to David as vain man
[1:22:55] running away from debts when they
[1:22:58] gathered around David something entered
[1:23:00] them that made them start killing the
[1:23:03] alliance as David did that made them
[1:23:06] killed Giants as devoted when they
[1:23:09] gathered around Christ something entered
[1:23:12] them that made them cast out Devils as
[1:23:14] Christ did when you gather around the
[1:23:17] message something must enter you that
[1:23:19] makes you Supernatural life
[1:23:22] I don't believe in Supernatural life of
[1:23:25] a messenger a natural life of believers
[1:23:28] who follow him
[1:23:29] no we must say the same Jesus alive says
[1:23:34] would see Jesus
[1:23:36] I know some of you have seen the devil
[1:23:38] but have you seen Jesus in your life
[1:23:40] I've seen the devil in my children the
[1:23:43] death in my husband the devil in the
[1:23:45] pastor the devil hey if you have so much
[1:23:48] of the devil in you you will see him
[1:23:49] everywhere
[1:23:50] but if you have so much of Christ in you
[1:23:53] you will see Christ in your pastor
[1:23:55] Christ in your life Christ in you the
[1:23:58] hope of glory
[1:24:00] what the devil fears is a Believer who
[1:24:03] knows his position
[1:24:05] because your position is linked to your
[1:24:08] possession
[1:24:10] so the original pre-fall state of man is
[1:24:14] what we are being restored to
[1:24:16] in the threefold purpose of God to
[1:24:19] reveal himself to a preeminence in a
[1:24:22] body of Believers and to restore the
[1:24:25] kingdom
[1:24:26] meaning whatever the devil stole from
[1:24:28] you must be restored today
[1:24:33] and it must be Sevenfold
[1:24:36] you must be seven times healthier than
[1:24:39] before you were sick
[1:24:41] whatever the devil stole from your life
[1:24:43] we want to force him
[1:24:45] we are not in talking terms with the
[1:24:47] devil but we are in casting terms
[1:24:50] today we want to silence the devil in
[1:24:53] your life
[1:24:54] I know something can happen in your life
[1:24:56] that we can say from that time
[1:24:59] consider from this day upwards
[1:25:02] your body is not a temp of sicknesses
[1:25:05] you are a temple of the holy spirit so
[1:25:07] what you don't want in your body must
[1:25:10] live
[1:25:11] yes if we believe that our bodies shall
[1:25:14] be changed in a moment in the think of
[1:25:17] an eye let's see a change in our lives
[1:25:21] now
[1:25:21] let's see a change you know God can
[1:25:25] restore what has been stolen in your
[1:25:26] marriage
[1:25:28] when you say enough is enough
[1:25:30] God can bring a permanent solution
[1:25:33] I don't believe in dealing with the same
[1:25:35] issue over and over but I believe
[1:25:38] whosoever the sun sets free is free
[1:25:41] indeed
[1:25:42] there can't be a permanent solution to
[1:25:45] those evil dreams they can be a
[1:25:47] permanent solution to those evil desires
[1:25:49] they can be a permanent solution to
[1:25:52] those evil addictions there can be a
[1:25:55] permanent solution to all those battles
[1:25:58] when we take the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:01] and put a full stop to your situation
[1:26:04] and we draw a no-fly zone for the devil
[1:26:07] in your life
[1:26:09] when
[1:26:10] question was in Egypt but Egypt was not
[1:26:13] in God
[1:26:15] we are in
[1:26:16] lautisia is not in US
[1:26:19] there was a spirit a spiritual boundary
[1:26:22] between Goshen and Egypt
[1:26:24] there was no physical separation
[1:26:28] but frogs could see the boundaries they
[1:26:30] were trying to fly over this side
[1:26:33] they knew that they of this site cannot
[1:26:36] be touched by what is touching those of
[1:26:38] that side
[1:26:41] as the lockers were flying they all of a
[1:26:44] sudden met a spiritual boundary
[1:26:46] as problems are flying
[1:26:49] let them see a spirit God says I will
[1:26:52] make a difference between Israel and
[1:26:55] Egypt
[1:26:56] the difference between us and other
[1:26:58] people is the Holy Ghost
[1:27:00] take away the Holy Ghost you remain the
[1:27:02] same as other people
[1:27:04] the difference between us and other
[1:27:06] people is the grace of God
[1:27:08] that's why none of us should burst in
[1:27:11] any way
[1:27:12] all of us must be patient with those who
[1:27:14] are outside
[1:27:15] this pulpit
[1:27:17] is not a push pit to push people into a
[1:27:20] pit it's a Pulpit to pull people from
[1:27:23] the pit
[1:27:25] that is how God works his program he has
[1:27:29] given us a minister of reconciliation
[1:27:33] by the grace of God
[1:27:35] I've seen serious tumors one sister at
[1:27:39] the cancer of the of the cervix
[1:27:42] came on Sunday we prayed for her eight
[1:27:44] demons manifested
[1:27:46] and they went away with the cancer
[1:27:49] and my friend Dr ngwenya the guy was
[1:27:53] supposed to operate that system
[1:27:55] it happened in 2012 she still has healed
[1:27:58] as she was
[1:28:01] there is no hard feeling half
[1:28:04] Deliverance half Holy Ghost baptism when
[1:28:06] God does something in your life
[1:28:10] the devil cannot reverse it
[1:28:13] things must happen if God has done it
[1:28:17] before
[1:28:18] he can do it
[1:28:20] if God has healed you before he can heal
[1:28:22] you again if God has touched you before
[1:28:24] he can touch you again if God has used
[1:28:27] you before he can use you again if God
[1:28:29] has forgiven you before and anointed you
[1:28:32] before he can anoint you before again if
[1:28:34] God has opened the way for you he shall
[1:28:37] open away again if God is undertaken for
[1:28:40] you he can undertake for you again
[1:28:43] I want you to believe today
[1:28:46] our services are not normal services
[1:28:49] we cannot coexist with spirits and the
[1:28:51] sicknesses when God comes down something
[1:28:54] must vanish in your life
[1:28:57] I want to put every Spirit under my feet
[1:28:59] today
[1:29:00] every service is a shutdown and I
[1:29:03] believe things change overnight
[1:29:06] [Applause]
[1:29:09] choice that moved from that prison to
[1:29:11] the throne overnight
[1:29:14] one night he was in prison
[1:29:17] with a promise
[1:29:19] to come out
[1:29:22] you are in that situation with the
[1:29:24] promise hanging over you
[1:29:26] and we are activating the promise
[1:29:30] before you were in that situation
[1:29:33] there was a scripture written to take
[1:29:35] you out
[1:29:37] the Bible says when you pass through the
[1:29:39] waters I'll be with you when you pass
[1:29:42] through the fire Isaiah 15 43
[1:29:44] that scripture was written before Jonah
[1:29:47] was in the waters
[1:29:49] when he entered the waters God says when
[1:29:52] you you are in the waters it was written
[1:29:54] before Jonah was born Maybe
[1:29:57] but it worked when he entered the waters
[1:29:59] because it says when you pass through
[1:30:00] the waters
[1:30:01] it was written before they were in the
[1:30:03] fire furnace and he says when you enter
[1:30:06] the fire I'll be with you so there is a
[1:30:09] scripture that was written before you
[1:30:10] were born
[1:30:12] oh the love of God is so great
[1:30:15] in if you read in Revelation chapter 5
[1:30:17] there are more than 100 trillion angels
[1:30:19] in heaven
[1:30:20] shouting the places of God
[1:30:23] so if demons that fail are attacked
[1:30:27] probably it's about 50 trillion devils
[1:30:30] meaning even if the devil adds 200
[1:30:33] million he has ended yes it is 0.2
[1:30:37] of demons
[1:30:39] but look at this let's say if the Angels
[1:30:44] like return in Revelation chapter 500
[1:30:46] trillion
[1:30:49] um and there are trillions of devils
[1:30:52] when Angels they say 50 trillion engines
[1:30:54] fell it's not the actual number it's
[1:30:56] just amazing mathematics God has no
[1:30:59] mathematics in this program
[1:31:01] so if a 50 trillion engines fell
[1:31:06] and God did not make a Plan of
[1:31:08] Redemption
[1:31:09] and within two people fail
[1:31:12] and God says we have to move now
[1:31:16] when trillions of angels fell
[1:31:19] would say good riddance
[1:31:22] I'm not going to die for this
[1:31:25] but when two people
[1:31:28] in the Garden of Eden Fell
[1:31:30] down from his glory
[1:31:32] God came down
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:36] town he has made you above angels
[1:31:39] Angelita pooped is more powerful than
[1:31:42] the angel in heaven
[1:31:45] that's why I'm saying Heaven Affairs can
[1:31:47] sort your home affairs
[1:31:50] it's higher than that
[1:31:51] all the Fifth Dimension things that
[1:31:54] happening in you in your life are lower
[1:31:56] because we are speaking from the seventh
[1:31:57] dimension
[1:31:58] and God is a god of restoration
[1:32:02] listen as I'm about to cross I think I
[1:32:05] fight for so minutes to close
[1:32:07] but I'm feeling like this is me feeling
[1:32:10] I'm feeling like they should be a
[1:32:12] special case today to be attended
[1:32:16] when God gives gifts to his people he
[1:32:18] knows
[1:32:19] how to answer the patterns of the people
[1:32:23] it says the end time message will meet
[1:32:26] the end time conditions
[1:32:28] we cannot preach about the God and
[1:32:30] dismiss people with their problems
[1:32:32] there must be a performance
[1:32:35] blessed is she that believeth for they
[1:32:37] shall be a performance
[1:32:39] remember brother
[1:32:41] the holy spirit that was in our prophet
[1:32:43] oh that was in Jesus Christ
[1:32:46] is not Class A Holy Spirit and you
[1:32:49] receive caspi
[1:32:51] God there's no classes of the anointing
[1:32:53] to say this is for prophets this is for
[1:32:56] a regular member the same Holy Cross
[1:32:59] it's in you today
[1:33:01] the same power to speak the word
[1:33:04] don't leave it to yourself
[1:33:06] when Cornelius saw a vision
[1:33:09] Visions are not for Prophets
[1:33:11] Cornelius was not yet baptized in the
[1:33:13] name of Jesus Christ when he saw a
[1:33:15] vision
[1:33:18] he he didn't even have the Holy Spirit
[1:33:21] when he's so efficient
[1:33:23] he just desired things of God
[1:33:27] if you are hungry and test for the
[1:33:28] things of God
[1:33:30] thing will magnetize God into your life
[1:33:33] When Auntie Jemima saw that dream and
[1:33:36] vision she didn't even have the seals
[1:33:38] and the Thunders
[1:33:40] yes because
[1:33:42] that same God who has given us a rich
[1:33:45] message
[1:33:47] of the seals standards in the abstract
[1:33:50] tits must break the seals of your life
[1:33:54] ensure the worst writers that are
[1:33:56] damaging things financial and spiritual
[1:33:58] in your life
[1:33:59] he must show the host writers that are
[1:34:02] Galloping in your spiritual life making
[1:34:03] you fail to pray
[1:34:05] that same God must reveal also the
[1:34:08] church edges of your life
[1:34:10] because some of you are in Ephesus
[1:34:13] you've lost your first love
[1:34:14] some of you I are in Smyrna you are
[1:34:19] persecuted you are poor but you are rich
[1:34:22] some of you are in pecamus you have been
[1:34:26] married with wealthy websites and
[1:34:28] pornographic sites and things thoroughly
[1:34:30] married
[1:34:31] some of you are in the dark edges of the
[1:34:34] attire things are that Financial that
[1:34:37] spiritually but God is the Morning Star
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:41] some of you are in satis you have a name
[1:34:44] that you live but you are dead
[1:34:46] you have a name that you're a brother
[1:34:48] and a sister but you are dead
[1:34:51] some of you are in Philadelphia
[1:34:54] God says because you have little
[1:34:56] strength I will set before you an open
[1:34:59] door and I say may God open doors in
[1:35:03] your life that you have never entered
[1:35:05] before some of you are in love this year
[1:35:08] I like this because laodicea started as
[1:35:11] a nothing as the west of the edges there
[1:35:15] is not even a eulogy where gods in other
[1:35:18] edges is touched by praising them for
[1:35:20] the good but in laodicea he has nothing
[1:35:23] to praise them for
[1:35:25] so it was the worst Edge
[1:35:27] but as we speak today is the best
[1:35:31] because Christ canceled them
[1:35:34] sent his Spirit sent the message and
[1:35:37] there's never been a day like this day
[1:35:39] this is the best of all ages
[1:35:42] so out of weakness they were made strong
[1:35:46] you start as nothing but courteous
[1:35:49] attendance of taking no parties and
[1:35:52] making somebody's out of them
[1:35:55] God is attendance of taking broken
[1:35:57] pieces and making masterpieces out of
[1:36:02] them the broken pieces of your life if
[1:36:05] you give them to God
[1:36:07] now he is a master of restoration
[1:36:10] he knows how to restore my prayer today
[1:36:13] is that everything that the devil stole
[1:36:15] from your life shall come back in a
[1:36:17] mysterious way
[1:36:20] when Ezekiel went to the fall of tripods
[1:36:23] he found things so disjointed
[1:36:25] he found so many bones that way it was
[1:36:28] negative after negative one it was a
[1:36:31] valley two there were broken bones two
[1:36:34] maybe three they were so dusty maybe
[1:36:36] they were so cold it was negative after
[1:36:39] Negative they were so hopeless
[1:36:41] but when he spoke the word
[1:36:43] things started connecting yes I speak
[1:36:47] the word I say dry marriage is here at
[1:36:50] the word of the Lord
[1:36:51] dry youth hear the word of the Lord
[1:36:53] backslide has come back to God
[1:36:57] now maybe let me ask um
[1:37:02] youth let's turn to our feet because I
[1:37:04] want to finish very soon why I want to
[1:37:06] finish very soon I want to steal
[1:37:09] 10 minutes to assist somebody in prayer
[1:37:13] I believe in the power of the word of
[1:37:15] God
[1:37:16] I believe in the power of the spoken
[1:37:18] word there is power in the written word
[1:37:20] there is power in the spoken word there
[1:37:23] is power in the revealed word there is
[1:37:25] power in the manifested word and there's
[1:37:27] power in you as a written episode
[1:37:30] as much as this word was translated you
[1:37:35] shall be translated one of these days
[1:37:38] now
[1:37:40] this power
[1:37:41] in the first poem laying one of hands
[1:37:44] and so forth there's power in the
[1:37:46] Deadpool
[1:37:46] now we're going to pull it first and
[1:37:49] third until there's an answer
[1:37:52] I believe in laying on offense as the
[1:37:55] Bible says
[1:37:57] I believe in casting all Devils as the
[1:38:00] Bible says
[1:38:02] I know preaching cast out devil is true
[1:38:04] when Christ finished the sermon on the
[1:38:07] mountain there was still a leper I know
[1:38:09] many deficit gone he had to deal with
[1:38:11] that leper
[1:38:12] when the prophet is preached a
[1:38:14] three-hour sermon
[1:38:16] you say this is a stubborn case I have
[1:38:18] to deal with it
[1:38:20] but he has been preaching
[1:38:22] so whosoever escapes the sword of jail
[1:38:26] or whatever sword the other one escapes
[1:38:29] the other sword will destroy
[1:38:32] when the prophet descend a tumor in
[1:38:36] meter
[1:38:37] by first pull hence he cast It Out by
[1:38:40] Deadpool and said before the doctors
[1:38:43] touch my wife
[1:38:45] let the hand of God dissolve the tumor
[1:38:49] I've been all around the world
[1:38:50] ministering the word of God this one
[1:38:53] thing I can tell you God is not a
[1:38:56] respecter of persons and God does not
[1:38:59] fail his people
[1:39:00] today if you need the Holy Spirit you
[1:39:03] shall receive the Holy Spirit today if
[1:39:06] there is a sickness in your body
[1:39:08] that sickness will vanish
[1:39:10] that great physician is here the great
[1:39:13] emancipator the great section the great
[1:39:15] job
[1:39:16] big
[1:39:20] big
[1:39:21] job fact is here to answer you
[1:39:25] what men fail
[1:39:27] that's what God Specializes in
[1:39:30] what you have failed to do I want to say
[1:39:32] today even if you have tried to live a
[1:39:35] Christian Life
[1:39:36] and they have been failing consider from
[1:39:39] this day upwards
[1:39:41] something has to happen when party
[1:39:42] Robinson
[1:39:43] the Holy Cross is his temper disappeared
[1:39:47] when Esther went in to be with the King
[1:39:50] Herman's problem disappeared
[1:39:53] your problem must disappear today in the
[1:39:57] name of Jesus Christ
[1:39:59] healing is your Redemptive rights
[1:40:03] blessings are your Redemptive rights
[1:40:06] a Christian is not followed by deaths
[1:40:09] and poverty and worries and Misfortune
[1:40:11] and BPS
[1:40:13] but surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:40:16] follow you all the days of your life
[1:40:21] you must be blessed
[1:40:23] Luke chapter 2 verse 52 the Child Jesus
[1:40:26] grew physically
[1:40:28] in stature that is physical in wisdom
[1:40:32] mentally in favor with man that is
[1:40:36] socially in favor with God that is
[1:40:38] spiritual May a blessing of God be 360
[1:40:40] Degrees around you financially
[1:40:43] spiritually
[1:40:45] my children like this message because
[1:40:48] they've seen God
[1:40:50] we went to our farm one time with a
[1:40:52] dairy farm we went to a farm there and
[1:40:56] we saw a cow that was buried we prayed
[1:40:58] for it
[1:41:00] give twins
[1:41:03] now it's fair that I'm trying to tell my
[1:41:06] children do's and don'ts only
[1:41:08] but when you meet the supernatural the
[1:41:10] those who do themselves and the don'ts
[1:41:13] who don't themselves
[1:41:15] so when you meet that power of God which
[1:41:18] I invite every pet slider and everyone
[1:41:20] who has feeling emptiness in their lives
[1:41:23] May that power touch them today
[1:41:26] this moment as I call the musicians to
[1:41:29] take their positions
[1:41:31] we're all going to pray for a short time
[1:41:33] then I will ask only few people
[1:41:37] we have hardest patterns
[1:41:40] because I believe
[1:41:41] patterns are lifted Calvary
[1:41:44] if you have a situation
[1:41:46] and your problem gets so heavy and you
[1:41:49] think there's no way through
[1:41:50] he is the lion that prevailed it here's
[1:41:54] the mighty conqueror
[1:41:56] this word is not in word only
[1:41:59] but in power and demonstration
[1:42:03] we have more than seven Barren people
[1:42:06] that we prayed for that have children
[1:42:08] now
[1:42:10] is anything to add for the Lord
[1:42:13] father God can come out of the pages of
[1:42:15] the Bible
[1:42:16] there is no window shopping on the
[1:42:18] promise of God
[1:42:20] when you see something take it
[1:42:24] when you enter a shop
[1:42:26] you enter with your prayer with your
[1:42:28] shopping list
[1:42:30] but when you come out you come out with
[1:42:31] Goods
[1:42:33] when you enter the House of Prayer you
[1:42:35] enter with a prayer list
[1:42:37] but when you come out you come out with
[1:42:40] Goods
[1:42:43] it's going to materialize what you
[1:42:45] believe one day you shall step into it
[1:42:50] they were playing a song when I was
[1:42:52] preaching in a place called philippus
[1:42:54] I saw people living their crashes like
[1:42:57] that
[1:42:57] now what is strange is that I feel this
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:05] let's all cross our eyes
[1:43:08] and each one pray for a short time in
[1:43:11] their own way
[1:43:12] then after that
[1:43:14] I'll lay hands on a few with different
[1:43:17] burdens
[1:43:19] just to show that he is here
