anointing and touch every need touch those that are here and those that are not here Lord and just meet them wherever they may need in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen if you have your Bibles this morning we'll turn to the Book of Luke Luke chapter 5 Luke Chapter 5 and we'll start at verse Luke Chapter 5 and we'll start at verse 4 when you got it say amen amen and it reads now when he had left speaking he said to Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a dropped and Simon answering answered and said unto him Master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net and and when they had this done they inclosed they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and the Nets break and they beckoned unto the partner ERS which were in the other ship and that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sing when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at jesus' knee saying depart from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which were and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken amen God bless the reading of this of the word you may be seated amen this morning I'd like to take a simple text that I I entitled at Thy word amen at Thy word and it comes from if you look back in the scripture then you can see it here in verse verse 5 he said nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net see Jesus he had come to his disciples and after a long day and and they went out on the deep and they went fishing and Jesus and they had toiled all night to catch these fish now you got to think about it these fishermen they had fished all their lives they had done this and they knew how to do it but that night they came up empty but they but Jesus came to them and he said go back out and launch out into the deep and let down your nets and and and someone might have said well we done done this all night we done done this over and over again why we got to do it again but s and he had this little small thing called faith that he just believed that you know what I'm going to do it once more I'm going to try this once more even though I toed all night I'm going to go and I'm going to drop it down and he said at Thy word nevertheless at Thy word he might he came back and he said Lord forgive me depart from me for I am sinful cuz Simon might have doubt it but even in his little doubt he said you know what I'm still going to believe just enough to see if it's true I ain't got no harm in believing that God is still real I have no harm in believing that he's still God and that all I have to do is let it down if it don't happen then hey I have lost nothing but he came to him and he said nevertheless at at Thy word I let down the net and he let it down and he saw the great blessings that followed when he let down the net he realized they had enough of them and they both it was so much that it broke their Nets and they called their friends and it filled up their boat too see when God go to blessing he don't just bless you he blessed those that are around you sometimes all you have to believe is at Thy word and take them at his word and God can do the miraculous God can do the wonderful because he's God so all you have to do is believe at his word sometimes we come to this place and I was looking at it and there's so many there's gateways to to a man and and the first is in the body and you have you have the five senses you have sight you have smell you have hear hearing you have taste and touch and when you go down to the next level you get into the spirit where there's imagination constant conscience memory reason and affections but deep down in the inside there's something called the soul and in your soul you only have two things there's faith and there's doubt amen and sometimes you have to choose which one you going to you going to side on but when you come to it the one that you should side on is Faith cuz with that all things are POS possible all you have to do is believe just have faith in What God Says and nothing can stand against you he said no weapon formed against me shall prosper and all you have to do is take God's word and you can defeat every devil and every demon that may come against you that's what Jesus did when he took him up on the mountain he he took him up there he said all this I give you and and and the Jesus said thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God he wasn't using nothing new it was already written it was already there he didn't have to go find it cuz he knew it it was already in him that's why the Bible says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he shall not depart from it he said Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee see something things got to be in you so when the Devil Comes you wanton you'll be able to defeat them you may have strayed away a little here there but you still remember the small things of when you learn when you were in your child and when you're Youth and sometimes it don't happen in everyone's youth it happens when you get older but when you learn it you realize that God is real you realize that all I have to do is stand on God's word and he'll take care of the rest all I have to do is believe that he is God and he'll take care of the rest all that I may think I want to do and may want to achieve God is able to do it for me all I have to do is believe and I was reading something and I I was reading and I thought about the story in Matthew chapter 14 if we can turn there Matthew chapter 14 and there's another story about Jesus on the Jesus dealing with the boat and his disciples and in verse 14 chapter 14 and verse 22 and it reads and straight away Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side and while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves from the wind for the winds was contrary see sometimes you get in life and it's like a ship on a stormy sea and the winds are blowing and the waves are tossing and you're going back and forth and and when you read on it said in the Fourth Watch of the night see sometimes the ship toss all night long it toss all night long and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they was troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for for fear but straight away Jesus spake unto them and saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid they said when God shows up he always says Be not Afraid cuz you don't have to be no afraid afraid no more cuz the one that can calm the sea is there in the midst and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me bid me to come unto thee on the water and he said come see at at his word Peter decided that he he got enough faith and he went and said when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus Peter Faith increased by the word of God his faith increased when he heard Come Peter got his faith increased and he stepped down on the water but here's what happened see in verse 30 he said but when he saw the winds boisterous and he was afraid and be and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me see once Peter stopped looking at Jesus and he looked at the storm he began to doubt he began to doubt on his salvation he began to doubt on what was taking place he lost faith that Jesus had told him to come and that Jesus had provided a way for him to make to him he had provided a way that he' be able to walk on the water all the way to Jesus because Jesus told him to come because he started looking at the storm and he might have remembered how he was in the ship tossing and turning and they didn't know if they was going to make it but he but Jesus had told him to come and and he cried and saying Lord save me and verse 31 it says and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hands and C him and said oh thou of little faith wherefore didst th doubt I wonder this morning sometimes when you come to God and you're asking for something does is this what God asks you sometime oh thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt say there's nothing that God can't do there's nothing that is impossible and he gives us testimonies over testimony to show us that he's still God and when they were coming to the ship in verse 32 the wind ceased and then they that were in the ship come and worshiped him I'm saying of Truth thou are the Son of God said there was many in in the scripture said that some people have to see to believe but it's more blessed to believe without seeing something that that you can just take a word and go forth and believe that God is able to do it it's something that come to him and just read something and it catch a hole deep down on the inside and it moves you to a point that you say I have no doubt I can move on and I can step forward because CU I can I believe that what he said is true I believe that what he said is possible and I believe that God is still God and he can do it he said that that he he'll never leave you nor forsake you and he'll be to there always and I was reading something and I started to think about how powerful the word of God is amen I started to think about and I was reading something and they were starting to describe said you know the same faith that Peter had where he said neveress at Thy word and he let down the nests that's the same power in those words that created the world and he started taking it from Genesis and said that's the same one that said let there be light and there was light that's the same words that said let the let the waters be separated from the land that's the same one that created the animals that's the same one that created the trees that's the same words that was able to create where we live today that's the same one that created Nations and caused them to rise up and caused them to be torn down that's the same one that causes Empires to rise up and be taken down that's the same one that comes by you each and every day that wakes you up in the morning that's the same one that allows you to go to sleep at night it's the same words that he just speaks the word and things happen you see it's at his word that thing that the moon hangs in the sky that the sun shines every day that the clouds come and cover the Earth it's the word words of God that allow these things to happen all you have to do is believe amen said I was reading something said if you have got a little faith let him have it a while he'll make it great said if you got a little faith let him have it a while he'll make it great that's right the likes of the fishes in the boy's hand it was just it could only feed him but in jesus' hand it fed 5,000 said it was just a little bit of Faith him just Allowing God he said Lord you can have what I have I just have a little bit I got five fishes and two loaves of bread said said he gave that to Jesus and it fed 5,000 just with a little bit of Faith see it may be a little thing with you but just give it over to him and watch him bless it and bless others with it and what and what little faith you have tonight give it over to him and he'll bless it and he'll use it for his glory say how how many want God to use your faith for his glory how many want God to use you for his glory and I was reading it all it takes is a little and I was reading in the text of how and I was going back over Theo this the story in the Bible where he talks all you have to do is have the faith of a mustard seed said it don't take much Faith to move to have God on the scene it don't take much faith for God to come down and move in such a mighty way all it takes is a little faith but all you have to take God at his word and he can do the impossible said Jesus healed a boy One Time by he spoke a word to his father and the next day the boy's fever left him that day and he began to amend see think about the word of God that God didn't even speak the word to the boy he spoke it to his father and things happen sometimes it's by your faith that things can happen for others it's by your faith and your prayers that things take place in other people's lives so don't forget when God plac someone on your heart to pray for them you don't know what God is doing in their life and he's using you to be a testimony he's using you to be someone to pull them through and to help them Reach to where God wants to get them to say he spoke to his father and said the Bible called it a miracle this is again the second Miracle Jesus did when he came into Galilee he said first he turned the water to wine now that the water would have been wine someday anyhow perhaps see this was catching to me I was reading I was reading this how he said that God turned the water into wine he said it would have it it would have been wine someday anyhow perhaps but it would have had to go through the regular procedure of going up the grap Vine coming out into the grae and bring brought back so forth like that and Jesus bypassed all that because he was the god of nature amen see God he sometimes your healing may be on the way but God can speed up the process he's the one that's able to create he's the only one that's able to create and said he just bypassed the vine and everything and he made the water right into wine because he had the control of all things didn't he have to be it didn't have to be distilled or however they make wine I don't know but anyhow he just turned it right into wine there and that was what we call a miracle see sometimes what we call a miracle is just God speeding up the process it's just God taking over and coming on the scene and said the next thing he did was to just speak a word and the man trying to get him to come pray for someone he said go thy way thy son liveth so all he has to do is speak a word and and things can happen but all we have to do is take his word when it's spoken and believe it it does you no good to hear the word spoken and not believe nothing that happen but sometimes you got to take that spoken word and believe it deep down in the inside and have faith and not doubt it no matter what no matter who says what and how it said to you all you have to do is have faith and never doubt said in Mark they was on the they was on the other ship and I and I wanted to highlight this one because when they was there it said something that was important when the waves were tossing and turning them they went and woke up Jes Jesus cuz he was on the ship and he was sleeping but when he was there and Jesus he he arose and he stood up and he chastised him and said said and I and I asked the question I said sometimes do we remember who's in the boat with us amen do we remember but when he stood up he said peace be still and sometimes that's what you need the Lord to do in your life you said Lord I need peace Lord I need Joy Lord I need patience Lord I need Temperance Lord I need you I need more love in my life I need more love in my heart for my brother for my sister but Lord sometimes the Lord comes and he allows you to see things to work on you he allows you to go through things to show you that there's more that you have to give and you have to take a more at his word there's more that you have to come to and you have to understand that sometimes those that are around you are just showing you that God is trying to work on you see you can't get your blessing until God has working on you sometimes and God is taking you through some things but all you have to do is come to and said Lord at Thy word I believe that no matter what I may be going through and no matter what I may be seeing that Lord you're still working on me you're still perfecting me and Lord I'm going to take you at your word and I'm not going to doubt I'm not going to doubt that Lord You Are God I'm not going to doubt that you can't change things for the greater and for a blessing to you and he said said that that that's why I liked it cuz he said he spoke the word and things happened amen it was a spoken word that come at that time and he spoke the word and and and the storm dissipated and it went back to calm seas now imagine all those fishermen that have been in many storms you had to know that that storm was bad you had to know this wasn't just a regular storm cuz they had been through storms many times in their lives they have done this all their life so they had to know that this was something that was different and they realized that you know what somebody got and said hold up Jesus is in the boat Jesus is in the ship with me why we need to go wake him up now we've seen Miracles we seen signs we seen these things but why don't we go get Jesus amen and it it I don't know who it was as I tell the story but when they got him on the scene Jesus stood up and he said peace be still amen said it it is it was really striking to me that the story was told many times but that was where they put down the words peace be still that he spoke to the storm it said is is I and I started to see that sometimes you got to go to the Lord and and get him on the scene and said Lord I need you to do a work Lord I need you to do something for me that may not others may not understand but I know that you the god that's real amen and I know that you you're the same God that spoke the heavens and the earth into existence you're the same God that that created life that created Man Out of the Dust of the ground you're the same God that came down and and you showed yourself forth by doing these many wonderful works and then I start to look in Acts and I started to see what would it what happens when people believe God's work what happens and I came to Acts chapter 4 and and Acts chapter 1 actually and I started to see what God told him he said and let's turn there Acts chapter one it's very familiar scripture acts 1 and verse4 and he said being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which sayth he ye have heard of me yay have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence say if you go on to the story in the book of Acts chapter 2 you realize that they listen to the word of God they got together and they got up in the upper room in verse 12 and chapter one but in verse in chapter 2 they talked about how that when they got together and on one one Accord by believing the word of God and what he has spoken to them things happened something happened in that upper room that was able to come down and the Holy Ghost came down on them just like clothing tongues of fire that was there in that room and it changed their lives forever it changed not only their lives but when they went out they was such a testimony that that day 3,000 people got saved Not only was it that some people Marvel because there was many different people that was there in that City many different languages nationality but everyone heard it in their own language see they believ the word of God to such a point that they wanted to see something happen they wanted to see that that word of God be manifested in them they wanted to come to the place that they realized that they didn't just want to hear the word of God but they wanted to be an enactment of that word of God out and forth and so they got there in the upper room and God came down in such a mighty and a special way that they was was able to witness and they was a and lives were changed and things happened and they went forth not only there that that testimony kept going because when they went back to their homes they had a testimony of what God could do they had a testimony of how great God was they had a testimony that God had died on the cross and had saved them and shed his blood and that he had went there to Calvary to die for sinners like them and he had allowed them to come back and to be uh uh have a way of propitiation to get back to Heaven see that day of just listening to what God has said and then saying Lord I'm going to take you at your word and just realizing the power and effect that the word of God has they was able to go on and to see God move in such a mighty and a special way amen yes amen said sometimes we have to get to the point that we just trust God Amen that we just said Lord I'm just going to take you at your word and it doesn't matter if this one or that one says yay or nay Lord I'm going to trust you Lord I'm going to take you at your word and I'm going to believe that you'll do just what you said Lord I'm going to believe that you can heal the sick cuz not only do I believe that I've seen you do it Lord I'm going to believe that you can save the Lost not only have I not only do I believe it but I've seen you do it so that just increases my faith that Lord you can continue to do it Lord I seen you answer prayers because I prayed and you've done it for me so Lord I'm going to believe that what I asked for Lord you're going to deliver it to me cuz you cuz I asked it from you and Lord as long as it wasn't contrary to your will you said that your word can't return to your Void said that's the God that he said just at my word all you have to do every blessing that you want is in his word all you have to do is ask and say Lord in your word you said you said and these things can happen for you these things can come to pass because it's at your word lord it's not my words lord it's what you said so I have faith in your word that you'll do what you said you'll do I have faith in your word that you can do these things The Impossible because you said there's nothing impossible if he can create the worlds he can do everything else and it and it says in Hebrews it says the worlds were created by by were framed by the word of God said the were framed by the word of God and see God has a way of doing anything and exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think cuz I thought about it I said sometimes we don't realize how limited our mind is amen yes we don't realize the limits that our minds come to it's only by his it's only that God allows us to sometime to see beyond what we can see he to see beyond that he takes you there he allows you and he does things that we can't even see or we don't even understand because he's God and he knows all things but we can take him at his word that all we he didn't say you had to do this or that he said just believe I thought about the prophet God he always Su that song only believe cuz the angel told him he said if you can get the the people to believe that's all that matters if if you can get the people to believe then the God would do the rest amen God would do the rest it wasn't a man but it was God doing the work it was God coming down and moving in the midst it was God because it was a people that that came to a certain point and come to certain level of faith that Lord I'm going to take you at your word that you can do the work Lord I'm going to take you at your word that you'll just move in my midst Lord I have a need and Lord I want you to come down and I want you to touch that neede Lord I want you to move in such a mighty way cuz Lord I'm going to take you at your word amen yeah say it wasn't a man or anybody else that can do it it's not you that can heal but God's the only Healer not even the doctor can heal you only God can heal you and God and you have to go and say Lord by your stripes I am healed so sometimes someone might not understand cuz you might still be limping you might not still as the as the story May said you might still your eyes might still be blinded but that doesn't mean that God hasn't done the work that doesn't mean that God isn't started the process that doesn't mean that it's not going to take place all you have to do is not doubt all you have to do is continue to believe that God is God and I'm going to take you at your word that you can do the thing that you said you would do you can move in my midst Lord you can do it for me and I don't have to go here or there I can believe that you still God I can believe that you're still going to do your word said that that's the god that moves and he's allows us to see the Lord that I can still have faith in you there's many that's Fallen here or there but I said you can never lose faith in God because he's been too good and he's allowed us to continue to grow and continue to live and to continue to show us that Lord there's even more each and every day if you just read your Bible you'll learn something that you hadn't read before you'll realize that you know it gets better and better the longer that you live and the more that you you study and the more that you come to and say Lord I didn't read this but Lord I Thank you for this today Lord I didn't see this before but I thank you for this today and there something new that just might catch your attention that you can take God just a little bit more take him a little bit further cuz it's at his word and there's nothing that you may have gone through or nothing that you might have experienced that is not covered in his word that's not covered in his word doesn't matter how hard it is doesn't matter how difficult it is it doesn't matter how specific you think it is to you cuz sometimes you going a go through something and you think that I'm the only one but then if you read in the scripture you see what Elijah he went to God and he said the same thing he said Lord I'm the only one but when you came down and said no no no the Lord had to correct and say no there's 7,000 that's still worshiping me there's 7,000 that's still believing that's still believing in the way that you do so it's not just you he said there's some that haven't given up there's something that still take me at my word there's something that still takes the the moments to believe that I'm still God and I can do the impossible said that even though they have went through many things and they had understood these disciples had seen many works it wasn't until then that they that it changed their life it wasn't until then that said God might have done it just to show you that sometimes all it takes is the right word amen he all it takes is the right word at the right time to strike a seed and that seed will grow sometimes all it takes you can water seed and water seed but if you never put light on it it'll never grow if you never put it in the sun it'll never grow no matter how much you water it and water it and water it sometimes you can drown the seed you'll kill it but sometimes you got to have the sun to strike it to cause that seed to die and get in that ground and get in that soil to die and to cause a new light to spring up out of it amen if you ever watch the seed grow I encourage you to do it just plant one and look up and you you'll see it Sprout up if you water and and leave it in the sunlight but sometimes there's seeds that are planted that that have to hit the right atmosphere to grow they have to hit the right they have to hear the right words at the right time to cause it to strike something deep inside that say that's the truth that's right I believe and then they go on from there says sometimes you just want someone to catch one word amen one word and and and for them to for it to change their lives says sometimes they might not hear every word but if they get one word is it's enough to do something to sustain them to allow them to start hungering and thirsting after something else hungering and thirsting after something else and allow them that God will continue to work in their lives that God will continue to work in our lives and he'll show us more and take us deeper and allow us to grow closer to him that we can continue to believe you more and more and take you more and more at your word take you more and more at your word and sometimes it starts here but if you if you live and you continue to grow and continue to trust him you'll grow your faith will grow you'll grow and you'll take more of his word and you'll take more of his word that you you'd be like John you can eat the whole book and he came and he took the book but he said that that that you'll be able to have it all all you have to do is take him at his word yes amen and believe that he's God and he'll do greater in you than you can ever imagine yes Lord see cuz God's word is more powerful than anything else that you may have on this Earth amen anything else more powerful than the atomic bombs cuz when you pray to God and you take him at his word it can do things that those things can't do it can do things that that you never imagine because he's God he's the god that created all things so what makes you think that your thing is impossible what makes you think that your thing hasn't that that he hasn't covered it cuz God he allowed all these things to take place to show you that he was God he didn't allow these things to just happen by chance he said all my steps have been ordered by the Lord so he didn't allow you just to these things just to happen he allow these things to show you that I'm God and just wants you to get to a place to believe that all things are possible all you have to do is take me by Your Word by by my word and all things are possible because it's that thy words that the storms can cease it's that that my word that the trials can dissipate is that my word that the sicknesses can go away it's that my word that all these things that may happen to me can just dissipate and disappear because I'm God and there's nothing that I can't do I'm God and there's nothing that I can't deliver you from I'm God there's nothing that I can't heal you from there God that there's nothing that I can't create for you if you have a need there's nothing that I can't give to you cuz I promise to supply all your needs said that's what his word says all you have to do is take it and believe it and say that it's settled in me Lord I don't have to move on I don't have to go no further because Lord I'm going to take you at your word and believe that you can do it and if I believe that you can do it then I know that these things are happen I may not know how it will happen I may not know when it will happen but I know that it'll happen I know that it's going to take place because your word can't return into your Void your word can't come back to you without accomplishing what you sent it out to do so if you sent your word out and all I have to do is believe Lord let me believe so that these things may happen let me believe that you're the god that can save let me believe that you're the god that can deliver let me believe that you're the god that can heal you're the god that can create you're the god that can do exceedingly abundantly more than I can ask to thing because you're God Amen see that's all you that you have to do is take God that Lord if I need to be saved Lord I can believe that you died on the cross for my sins and that you can save me Lord I believe that you if I need the Holy Ghost I can believe that Lord you promised it to me and I can take it by your word that you would give it to me and you can do it for me today that's all that God wants you to do is just believe have faith that I'm God and I can do these things and they can happen for you all you have to do is come to him say Lord I Surrender and give up everything cuz sometimes you come to him and you say Lord I believe but you don't give it up you come to it but you don't want to give up this or don't want to give up that but God requires us all to give up everything you have to come to those cross RS in life that Lord I want to take you at your word but Lord I want to give up everything that I have and and Lord I want to take you at your word I want to take you that Lord you can deliver me you can do these things but Lord I have to give up these things but I can tell you it's worth giving up it's worth you giving up these things to get what God has for you it's worth you sacrificing these things to get what God has for you it's worth you laying down your life to what you think you may achieve in this world to get what God has for you it's worth you saying Lord Lord I I want to lay these things down because there's nothing God has never done anything to anybody that caused them to say that God wasn't good to him amen God has never done anything to anybody to say that you know that wasn't a good decision so people may turn to left right but they don't say that God wasn't good to them or that wasn't a good decision said things may happen that cause people to do this or do that but anytime you get to him you realize that God is still good amen and God is still the one that come to when they need help they'll turn around and say Lord I need you they might have turned to the left but when they get in a time of trouble they get down and say Lord I need you because they know that when they call on them that something happens they know that when they go to them something happens they know that when they get in desperation that they need God to show up on the scene God to show up on time cuz he promised to be there for him he said I never leave you nor forsake you and he promised to be there so no matter how bad the situation get they always know where to go back to am but why why go back to him when you don't have to leave them amen in the first place you don't have to leave them in the first place you can have them there right by your side you don't have to get in a state of desperation to feel God right next to you you can have them there walking beside you each and every day where when you get down and you say a prayer that you can hear him talk to you you can hear them and you can feel them right next to you because you know that God is with you am so when you step into the room you know that it's nothing that you've done but he's there with you he's guiding you he's leading you and sometimes you have to get down to dying out to yourself and letting go of everything so that you can get so close to him that he's with you there's nothing that's in you that's wrong there's nothing that's beside you that's wrong you said Lord I come and I Surrender everything to you you have to die down as Paul said I Die daily because every single day something may arise in you that cause you to forget sometime not to forget over the long but for a moment that he that God is there or or to not acknowledge that it's only by his grace that you're still there to acknowledge that it's only by his grace and his Mercy that you're able to do the things that you're able to do but all that I say and encourage you to do is take God at his word take him and believe that God will do exactly what he says believe on that God God has save you from your sins
