[31:52] in Matthew 25 and 5 why the bridegroom
[32:04] tarried they all slumbered and sleep
[32:06] well and then midnight there was a cry
[32:09] made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye
[32:13] out to meet him then all those words and
[32:16] rose and trimmed their lamps and the
[32:19] foolish said to the wise give us of you
[32:22] all for our lamps are going out the wise
[32:26] answered saying not so least there'll be
[32:29] not enough for us in you but go ye
[32:33] rather to them that sell and buy for
[32:36] yourself why they went to buy the
[32:40] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[32:44] went in with him to the marriage and the
[32:49] door was shut and the doctor came also
[32:52] other virgins saying Lord open Lord open
[32:59] to us but he answered and said verily I
[33:03] say unto you
[33:04] I know you're not watch therefore that
[33:10] you know for you know neither the day
[33:12] nor the hour wherein the Son of man
[33:16] cometh the godless to renew his word you
[33:21] may be seated we thank God for amen this
[33:26] day we are talking about again and again
[33:30] and again you've heard the message
[33:33] midnight cry if there had ever been a
[33:38] time that we would look at World War 1
[33:45] and World War 2 and they started talking
[33:47] about when they bombs were dropped in
[33:52] Japan and so forth that it was three
[33:55] minutes to midnight but years have
[34:00] passed and yet seemeth Oh amen the end
[34:09] of all things have not come as of yet
[34:15] but if they could say then the sixth is
[34:20] that it was three minutes to midnight
[34:24] then our I say in 2020 I said we must be
[34:32] past midnight
[34:34] I said midnight I should have passed a
[34:40] long time ago and at midnight it's past
[34:43] and where are we and when we talk about
[34:47] the midnight we're talking about the end
[34:49] and the consummation of all things all
[34:55] things have come to his final destiny
[34:59] and everything it's come to the midnight
[35:04] signifies they meant that the day is
[35:09] passed
[35:11] thus midnight is speaking to us
[35:16] concerning
[35:17] I cried being me
[35:22] the card that was being made it was the
[35:27] coming of the Lord that the bridegroom
[35:34] is coming you and I brought our knuckles
[35:40] san dimas' expecting the bridegroom will
[35:48] expected that the bridegroom the Lord
[35:51] Jesus is coming soon and it will expect
[35:57] to Jesus to come soon then we must not
[36:06] give up but we must prepare for the
[36:14] coming as it was in the Jewish
[36:17] disposition so it is in the Gentile
[36:22] disposition God in my few 3 and 1 it
[36:33] says that in those days Came John the
[36:38] Baptist preaching in the wilderness of
[36:41] Judea and saying repent ye for the
[36:46] kingdom of heaven is at hand
[36:51] we're saying that the rapture in the
[36:54] coming of the Lord is at hand that's a
[37:00] good sound and that's what's saying to
[37:04] you that is an expectation for the Lord
[37:09] to come but the foolish it was enough
[37:16] they were brothers sisters we can't be
[37:27] halfway Christian
[37:32] [Music]
[37:40] I'm saying brothers and sisters to
[37:45] happen but to cry here in to the Jews
[38:16] was the force of one crying in the
[38:21] wilderness for he said in the third
[38:27] verse for this is he that was spoken by
[38:32] the Prophet is there özil the voice of
[38:37] one crying in the wilderness prepare ye
[38:41] the way of the Lord make his paths
[38:46] straight that must be a voice to go
[38:53] forward to get the bride ready for the
[38:57] bride rule the Bible said Jesus Christ
[39:02] the same yesterday today and forever
[39:08] John wasn't a Pharisee he wasn't a
[39:15] Sadducee but he came out of the
[39:22] wilderness
[39:24] he wasn't no channel for he did not
[39:32] dress with the fine rules he didn't even
[39:37] have a church building but he had
[40:02] [Music]
[40:15] [Music]
[41:02] it was a message of repentance it was a
[41:07] message that we need to repent I believe
[41:16] there's always a cry of repentance when
[41:23] it stays away from God when man get off
[41:28] the street now I believe God always send
[41:34] somebody to cry out to church we got to
[41:43] get back and God will send a word it
[41:50] said my brothers you got to get back
[41:56] you see where God is I believe church on
[43:48] and not be just an ordinary thing people
[43:53] of God or to not be he meant just folks
[43:57] that talk to talk he meant that the
[44:00] folks are come and walk the walk they
[44:04] ought to come with the line that worthy
[44:07] of the gospel but
[44:39] but I want to God God to the world
[45:34] hallelujah and the Jewish disposition
[45:40] God took the stage and he told the king
[45:47] does not love for you to have your
[45:49] brother's wife and he got his head cut
[45:53] off brother sister are you willing to
[45:57] take a stand it was midnight to them the
[46:01] Jews did not know that they they just
[46:05] don't understand that is come and which
[46:13] they were praying for they were looking
[46:20] for
[47:25] what is it brother sister
[47:28] what is it friends of mine we got to
[47:32] recognize us the Lord what's going on
[47:37] why are we now that we haven't needed it
[47:42] people that need to such deep within
[47:45] themselves an order recognize what is
[47:51] going on in my life I said I've answered
[47:56] the call I'm hired to cry but my life
[48:03] the power don't Norton the spirit when
[48:08] you declared that these signs shall
[48:11] follow them that believe in my name they
[48:14] shall cast out devils brother sister
[48:18] where is God's power why is God's Spirit
[48:23] in yo life in the Vegas are you just
[48:31] cited for that
[48:32] in about God talking about what he was
[48:37] and what is will be but it's got riddle
[48:42] in you get the power of God in your life
[48:48] is that power in the night side of - oh
[49:00] brother sister yes you wanna god it's
[49:04] real what you want really somebody else
[49:07] later in the preacher maybe an
[49:10] evangelist but it's gotten real to you I
[49:15] said in midnight if this world it's
[49:20] coming to his here
[49:21] then that must be a church that's
[49:25] without spot without wrinkle what I
[49:30] believe is is that must be a church they
[49:35] make that John it summons the spirit of
[49:39] Elijah have summers that I'm calling the
[49:43] people back to God back to the world to
[49:48] get in line with the word come Oh
[49:52] somebody gotta get in each step Amen is
[49:58] the fight I believe will come numb we're
[50:05] satisfied will satisfy with God I bet
[50:09] somewhere but are you please are you
[50:16] really satisfied with the working of the
[50:20] Spirit in your life this is practice
[50:24] real to you do you really have to fire
[50:30] the John said after me was coming who go
[50:35] back to are you with the Holy Ghost and
[50:37] with fire there's a fire I wouldn't do a
[50:42] heart of gold
[50:43] take a fire burning
[50:46] they're the holy ghost burning in you
[50:50] yes there I desire for God to use you
[50:55] God I know you real God I know you here
[51:03] but what is going on brother sister too
[51:08] many of us have been satisfied lead back
[51:13] we haven't been responding to the word
[51:20] we believe that God is exist and he's to
[51:31] be worship but God did that the people
[51:36] are looking for maybe it's just a
[51:40] tradition maybe is just a same but the
[51:45] God that's with us promise that I will
[51:48] not leave your confidence that I'm gonna
[51:52] come and I'm gonna be in you God is its
[52:04] people

[54:43] God is not indicating your worship
[54:49] God is not giving confirmation to the
[54:53] way you live your revelation of the word
[54:59] is not right if it was then it would
[55:04] bring about putting power it would
[55:08] produce
