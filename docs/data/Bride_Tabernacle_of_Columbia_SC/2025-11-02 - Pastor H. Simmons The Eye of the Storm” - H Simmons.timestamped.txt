[35:38] and 36.
[35:43] Mark 4 and36.
[35:50] So many things
[35:52] that we were dealing with, but I had
[35:55] come back
[35:57] thinking about
[35:59] stepping into your glorified body.
[36:03] Praise God.
[36:05] Because there is a body.
[36:08] the prophet of God, he was saying in
[36:10] question that is right here now.
[36:14] Praise God. It's right here now.
[36:18] Praise God.
[36:21] Here in 36.
[36:24] And when they had sent, excuse me, when
[36:29] and when they had sent away the
[36:32] multitude,
[36:34] they took
[36:36] him
[36:38] even as he was in the ship.
[36:44] And there were also with him other
[36:47] little ships. And there arose a great
[36:51] storm
[36:53] of wind, and the waves beat unto enter
[36:58] the ship,
[37:00] so that it was now full.
[37:04] And he was in the hinder part of the
[37:08] ship, asleep on a pillow. And they awake
[37:12] him and said unto him, Master,
[37:17] carest thou not that we perish?
[37:20] And he arose and rebuked the winds and
[37:24] said into the sea, what
[37:27] &gt;&gt; peace be still.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; And the wind ceased,
[37:32] and there was a great calm.
[37:36] And he said unto them,
[37:39] Why are ye what? fearful.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; How is it that ye have what?
[37:46] &gt;&gt; No faith.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; And they feared exceedingly
[37:52] and said one to another, what
[37:56] &gt;&gt; manner is
[37:59] &gt;&gt; that even the winds in the sea obey him.
[38:02] God bless you in his word.
[38:05] You may be seated. Want to talk this
[38:08] morning a little bit about the eye of
[38:11] the storm.
[38:14] The eye of the storm.
[38:19] Looking at the news a little bit and
[38:22] I saw that they were talking about
[38:27] the eye of the storm.
[38:31] So, I thought I'll just
[38:34] talk to you about the eye of the storm.
[38:39] The eye of the storm literally means the
[38:43] calm,
[38:46] the clear center of the hurricane.
[38:50] Praise God. I I believe the
[38:55] not a natural storm,
[38:59] a natural hurricane,
[39:03] but I believe that there's a spiritual
[39:05] storm
[39:07] that is hidden.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; There's an econom
[39:11] economical storm.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; People are losing their jobs left and
[39:16] right.
[39:22] Some folks are panicking
[39:25] because of the things that are happening
[39:29] concerning uh the food stamps and
[39:32] situations.
[39:35] So, we're in a a crisis. [snorts]
[39:42] Folks don't know what's going to happen
[39:44] next. Amen.
[39:48] It says
[39:52] the center of the hurricane
[39:55] figuratively
[39:58] it describes a person
[40:01] or situation
[40:03] at the center of a cha audit
[40:09] or a controversial
[40:12] even event.
[40:16] who remains calm
[40:19] and composed. [snorts]
[40:24] A chaotic
[40:26] uh controversial event
[40:29] and remaining calm
[40:36] and composed.
[40:39] I tried to say, "Oh, no, no, get away
[40:42] from it."
[40:45] But
[40:48] I felt like
[40:51] God, you're saying
[40:54] to somebody
[40:58] that's going through a storm right now.
[41:06] Things could be out of catered or
[41:08] [screaming] chaotic like
[41:14] how you handling your storm.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Are you remaining calm
[41:24] and composed?
[41:30] He says
[41:32] it can also refer to a period of
[41:36] temporary
[41:37] calm in the midst of turbulent times.
[41:47] Temporarily calm
[41:50] in the midst of turbulent times.
[41:54] Praise God.
[41:56] the advice to those that
[42:00] were in the hurricane.
[42:04] When uh
[42:07] I or the storm came on the land,
[42:13] they said it bought about
[42:16] 175 miles an hour winds.
[42:21] We realize that the winds surround
[42:27] the hurricane
[42:30] and in the eye
[42:32] when it comes ashore
[42:35] there's a calm like the storm is over.
[42:41] It's it seem like the storm is over.
[42:46] YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO people when
[42:48] they think it's all over
[42:52] then they go back to norm
[42:59] and storms come in life
[43:03] and when you believe that it's all over
[43:08] then we go back to norm
[43:12] but they are warning the people don't
[43:16] because it's just the eye of the storm
[43:21] &gt;&gt; AND DON'T GO BACK TO NORMAL NOW. THIS IS
[43:25] JUST THE EYE OF IT. THIS IS JUST AMEN. A
[43:28] PARTIAL AMEN. CALM RIGHT NOW. JUST A
[43:32] temporary calmness.

[44:44] couldn't survive the storm.
[44:48] So they had to go to places uh uh that
[44:51] they provided where they can be more
[44:54] amended or secure.

[1:11:04] kill. Oh, you ain't got it.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; But not long after, there arose against
[1:11:10] it a temperous wind called Eurocaidon.
[1:11:15] And when the ship was caught and could
[1:11:17] not bear up into the wind, we let her
[1:11:20] drive. and running under a certain
[1:11:22] island which is called Clada. We had
[1:11:25] much work to come by the boat which when
[1:11:28] they had taken up they used helps
[1:11:30] undergurting the ship and fearing lest
[1:11:33] they should fall into the quick sands
[1:11:36] straight sail and we were driven and
[1:11:39] [snorts] we were exceedingly tossed with
[1:11:41] the tempest. The next day they lightened
[1:11:43] the ship and the third day we cast out
[1:11:46] with our own hands the tackling of the
[1:11:48] ship. See, they done took off when Paul
[1:11:50] told them not to take off and told him
[1:11:52] you're going to be in danger and you
[1:11:54] know they they they went on you know you
[1:11:56] can read 27 they take it off and when
[1:12:00] trouble come you know you know what
[1:12:02] happens when God done told you and
[1:12:05] trouble come
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; are you with me?
[1:12:09] [snorts]
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. God is God God can help you
[1:12:12] even in time of trouble.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Even when you've been disobedient, God
[1:12:16] still can help you. Yes.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; And when neither sun nor stars in many
[1:12:23] days appeared, and no small tempest lay
[1:12:26] on us, all hope that we should be saved
[1:12:29] was then taken away. But after long
[1:12:32] abstinence, Paul stood forth in the
[1:12:34] midst of them and said, "Sers, ye should
[1:12:37] have hearkened unto me and not have
[1:12:39] loosed from cit and to have gained this
[1:12:42] harm in loss. [snorts] And now I exhort
[1:12:45] you to be of good cheer. For there shall
[1:12:48] be no loss of any man's life among you,
[1:12:50] but of the ship. For there stood by me
[1:12:54] this night the angel of God whose I am
[1:12:57] and whom I serve, saying, "Fear not,
[1:13:00] Paul. There must be brought before
[1:13:03] Caesar.
[1:13:04] Thou must be brought before Caesar. And
[1:13:07] lo, God had given them all thee, all
[1:13:10] them that sail with thee.
[1:13:13] Wherefore, sers, be of good cheer, for I
[1:13:15] believe, for I believe God.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Do you believe God?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Be of good cheer then.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; That it shall be, even as it was told
[1:13:23] me, how be it, we must cast upon a
[1:13:26] certain island. But when the 14th night
[1:13:30] was come, as we were driven up and down
[1:13:32] in Adria, about midnight, the shipmen
[1:13:36] deemed that they drew near to some
[1:13:38] country, and sounded and founded 20
[1:13:41] fathoms. And when they had gone a little
[1:13:44] further, they sounded again, and founded
[1:13:46] 15 fathoms. Then, fearing least we
[1:13:49] should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
[1:13:53] four anchors out of the stern, and wish
[1:13:56] for the day. And as the shipmen were
[1:13:58] about to flee out of the ship, when they
[1:14:00] had let down the boat into the sea uh
[1:14:03] under color as though they would have
[1:14:06] cast anchors out of the force ship, Paul
[1:14:08] said to the centurion, to the soldiers,
[1:14:11] "Except thee abide in the ship."
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you something.
[1:14:15] Except you abide in the ship.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes people want to leave the
[1:14:20] ship.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; You want to leave the word.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; But don't know if you leave it. Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; If you leave the word,
[1:14:32] what do you say is going to happen?
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Ye cannot be saved.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying?
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; He said, abide
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; in the ship.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; If you leave,
[1:14:44] you can't be saved.
[1:14:50] You know, sometimes you preaching and
[1:14:53] you given a prophetic word.
[1:14:58] You're giving a prophetic word to
[1:14:59] somebody.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you feel like, hey, I know
[1:15:04] God is talking to somebody.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; It was it was meant that you speak this
[1:15:10] word when I tried to get around it, but
[1:15:13] you given a prophetic word.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; And when you give a prophetic word, you
[1:15:18] know God is talking to somebody.
[1:15:21] It's just not that you just all of a
[1:15:24] sudden you're going to speak this
[1:15:25] sermon, but you're giving a prophetic
[1:15:27] word to somebody. God is forewarning
[1:15:30] somebody.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; He's telling you, "Abide in the ship."
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; If you don't stay in the ship, you can't
[1:15:36] be saved.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I don't care how many pulls the devil is
[1:15:42] pulling on you. I don't care how the
[1:15:43] wind and t look like the ship's falling
[1:15:46] apart, but the ship is where you need to
[1:15:48] be. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to be saved.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You said, "Well, the ship falling
[1:15:54] apart. Every every time I fear from my
[1:15:57] life,
[1:15:58] [clears throat]
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; except you abide in the ship."
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Stay in Christ.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, stay in Christ.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Stay in the word.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't stay in the word, you
[1:16:12] can't be saved.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let us stand.
[1:16:20] Hallelujah.
[1:16:23] I said, "God, why I got to come back
[1:16:25] here?" Cuz you're talking to somebody.
[1:16:28] Somebody has to hear this.
[1:16:34] So, I had to say, "Well, if you got to
[1:16:36] hear this, then I'm saying I need to
[1:16:39] speak." Even though I felt like speaking
[1:16:44] on the glorified body
[1:16:48] that's right here right now,
[1:16:53] waiting to be charged by the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:59] Hallelujah.
[1:17:00] Father in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:17:05] I don't know Lord God that
[1:17:10] what's said that would mean something to

[1:17:19] in their life and is trying to sweep
[1:17:22] them into the world of a chaotic life.
