[35:17] and nothing shall be and nothing shall
[35:20] by any means hurt you amen so how many
[35:23] so we can see that God have gave the
[35:25] church the power amen so
[35:28] I can show you when God put the Power
[35:29] inside the church but no one can tell
[35:31] when God took the power out the church
[35:32] amen so that so we so that power is not
[35:35] coming that power is here right now amen
[35:37] so we don't so we don't need we don't
[35:38] need the power we need Faith or the
[35:40] Revelation to operate that power amen
[35:42] but once you have the power you have
[35:44] authority over the devil say I don't
[35:45] care what the devil do you have
[35:46] authority over him because our God G you
[35:48] the power over the devil and this they
[35:49] say devil you a liar I and over you amen
[35:53] by the power of the Holy Ghost amen amen
[35:56] glory so so we we should be we should be
[35:58] sad we should be not depressed we know
[36:00] we should know that God is on our side
[36:02] amen and if God be for you let the whole
[36:04] world be against you amen amen so so you
[36:06] realize you don't have no power you you
[36:08] you don't have no power you have
[36:09] authority by the power of being born
[36:11] again amen because realiz God let read
[36:14] one more script I think about how
[36:15] realize we thank God for Calvary thank
[36:18] God for remember it more than him him
[36:19] going to the cross and dying he came for
[36:21] a purpose amen the prophet God he came
[36:23] for three he Jesus Christ came for a
[36:26] three-fold purpose one of those perpect
[36:28] was he came to he wanted to reveal
[36:30] himself to his people God wanted God God
[36:33] wanted God want to know how you feel see
[36:36] God had attributes inside him say he
[36:38] want how many know he want to how many
[36:39] how many truly say they know that they
[36:41] know that God Is A
[36:43] Healer how many you to say you know you
[36:45] know that God is deliver amen how many
[36:48] you to say tonight I know that God is a
[36:50] savior amen so God had attributes inside
[36:53] him he wanted to express to his people
[36:55] but we had to do that he had to do it
[36:57] through through do a Plan of Redemption
[36:59] so one thing about God brother prop say
[37:01] God want to reveal himself to the people
[37:05] next thing he want to do he want
[37:06] secondly have the preeminence in the
[37:08] body of Believers that his bride that
[37:10] they might have that that he might live
[37:13] in his people come on now how how many
[37:16] of you are how many of you are a Tipple
[37:17] of the Holy Ghost amen so how many how
[37:20] many all that within God he poured into
[37:23] Christ now all that in Christ he is
[37:25] poured now into the bride so the same
[37:28] power that Christ got you got amen
[37:31] praise God Amen so how many how many how
[37:33] many we don't serve a weak God we serve
[37:35] a mighty God hey man I got to take my co
[37:38] I I'm feeling good I thank God so many
[37:41] times people realize that in his life
[37:45] say in his life you going to have
[37:46] trouble amen but be of good Che be of
[37:49] good cheer I overcome the world so so if
[37:52] you can if you dwell on what you are
[37:54] going through you can never see what God
[37:56] has put you here for man amen see God
[37:58] has put you here he has put you on this
[38:00] Earth to test you and try you to let the

[38:07] people on this work that love me above
[38:09] everything amen job I said we love God
[38:12] above our job am above there's nothing
[38:16] that come a Believer love God above
[38:18] everything
[38:19] amen cuz once you're born again once you
[38:23] be that's why one thing I think I think
[38:25] about think about your pastor Pastor
[38:26] Simmons man and Pastor one thing he say
[38:29] it's you must be born again am amen if
[38:33] you ain't born again you ain't got no
[38:35] power amen if you ain't got no power you
[38:37] ain't got no Authority amen but if you
[38:40] are born again you got you have
[38:41] authority by God okay what when say when
[38:45] the devil say boo you have the authority
[38:47] to say boo back amen amen remember you
[38:49] don't run from the devil amen because
[38:52] the devil has already been
[38:54] conquered at calary at Calvary but Jesus
[38:57] Christ said it is finished GL to God
[39:01] Christ don't pay for everything what
[39:03] whatever you need God don't pay for amen
[39:06] he done paay for your joy he done pay
[39:08] for your peace he done pay for
[39:10] everything God he said it is finished
[39:14] amen and the devil can't do nothing
[39:16] about
[39:18] amen do the devil ain't got to pay he
[39:21] don't he don't have a key to his own
[39:22] house amen God got the key see when
[39:26] Jesus Christ was I said I CAU up both
[39:28] death hell and the grave amen and he had
[39:31] the key God now the keys are in God's
[39:33] hands amen but let me ask you this
[39:35] question what God needed keys for let me
[39:38] ask you when Jesus Christ R again says
[39:40] all power is given unto me amen but how
[39:43] many know Christ is not here in the
[39:45] flesh no
[39:47] more he don't need the
[39:49] power you need the power but that's but
[39:53] the power God say now you are Christ in
[39:55] Bride form so that's what say the works
[39:58] I do you shall do also because the world
[40:01] see you they're not seeing you they see
[40:03] in Christ

[41:05] for yourself you will never be the same
[41:07] again amen that's why you must be born
[41:09] again
[41:10] Amen Let read that I think it's St John
[41:14] um chapter 19:3 man I'm going try to
[41:16] show you something see he had a purpose
[41:19] before I go so first he want to reveal
[41:21] themselves to the people he he want to
[41:23] had a preeminence remember everybody
[41:26] everybody God I mean I mean God don't
[41:28] want to be this be he don't want to be
[41:30] be the god of your life he want to be a
[41:32] lord of your life amen Lord mean
[41:35] ownership so when God tell you to go you
[41:38] will go when God say don't go say I want
[41:40] you want to be a prisoner to God Amen so
[41:43] once you become a PR of God remember I
[41:45] don't care what come go the Holy Ghost
[41:47] will never leave you wrong amen amen
[41:49] amen so St John St John 19 and ver3 I
[41:52] think it is St John 19:30 so I'm not
[41:54] going to be long com to close so his
[41:57] power power gives us our
[41:59] Authority remember you ain't got no
[42:01] power it's the holy ghost power amen how
[42:04] say Lord sit down a power down on me
[42:05] amen come on that Holy Ghost and that
[42:08] Holy Ghost once that power come brother
[42:10] Gordon it make you live right amen it'll
[42:12] make you talk right it'll make it dress
[42:14] right amen it'll make it go to the right
[42:16] place on that Holy Ghost once the Holy
[42:18] Ghost come and S now if it comes to roer
[42:20] and reer it come the roer and controller
[42:22] of your life amen GL God Amen now one
[42:25] time I used to go to club now now I
[42:27] don't go to club now and now I come to
[42:29] church amen why God is the ruler in my
[42:31] life amen cuz I've been born again
[42:34] amen but if you never be born again you
[42:37] really can't
[42:38] change but once you're born again you
[42:40] can change you can be transformed to the
[42:42] very image of almighty God Amen praise
[42:45] St
[42:46] John I can't get to it St John 19 I say
[42:50] verse 30 I think it is 19:30 man he
[42:52] Jesus on the
[42:54] cross he said give gim said Lord if this
[42:57] if it it be possible let this cup let
[43:00] this cup pass but not my will but thy
[43:02] will be done see Christ knew if I if I
[43:05] he remember Christ had to bring his own
[43:07] body subject to God's word amen never
[43:10] forget he was 100% man and 100% God Amen
[43:14] but he had to bring this body subject
[43:15] say I not my will but Christ's will be
[43:17] done but the Lord's will be done in my
[43:19] life how say Lord not my will amen I
[43:21] want God's will to be done my life amen
[43:24] come your life is really not your own
[43:26] amen the Bible say you're bought with a
[43:28] price and you're not your man so you
[43:30] want how want to give all your life all
[43:31] your time all your effort give all your
[43:32] strength to the Holy Ghost let God use
[43:34] you to his glory and to his praise amen
[43:36] it says and when Jesus therefore had
[43:39] received the vinar he said it is
[43:42] finished and he bowed his head and gave
[43:45] up the ghost amen so the last words
[43:47] Christ said was it is finished so he L
[43:49] that word up in the Greek iten it is
[43:51] finish mean that means praise God says
[43:53] to bring to an end to finish or complete
[43:57] so why he say this because now what he
[44:00] what God had in his mind say when Adam
[44:03] fell when Adam he did remember Adam was
[44:07] God where on
[44:09] Earth he had full Dominion on what
[44:12] whatever whatever Adam said God backed
[44:14] up but when Adam fell he did for the
[44:17] love of his wife the abstract title deed
[44:20] went back into the hands of
[44:21] God but God don't need it his children
[44:25] need it amen his son and door needed on
[44:28] this Earth amen so say I got I got to
[44:30] find a way to get my power so my
[44:33] children can have authority on this
[44:34] Earth back somehow amen but brother say
[44:37] every man that was born in sin was born
[44:39] in sin they could not they could not
[44:41] redeem no other man amen but think I I
[44:43] think of about Christ came down amen
[44:46] only he could redeem amen so Christ came
[44:48] through K redeem amen and once he paid
[44:51] the price that he once he paid the price
[44:54] that no man could pay it was finished
[44:56] amen man the power all the power that
[44:59] was in all the power in God now now I'm
[45:01] going give it to my Believers amen but
[45:03] but I I I want to get this point I say
[45:05] to finish finish mean in the Greek man
[45:08] means often written in on Ancient
[45:10] receipts or debts with the meaning paid
[45:13] in full
[45:15] amen so somebody had to pay the pay the
[45:18] penalty of sin amen but that person had
[45:20] to be worthy and no man was worthy
[45:23] Revelation 5 says who is worthy to take
[45:25] the book The the book was a book of
[45:27] redemption the the Bible and that book
[45:30] had all all God's children names was in
[45:32] this book amen but no man was worthy to
[45:35] take the book only one man could take
[45:37] the book and that was Jesus Christ amen
[45:39] so so so remember Paul wasn't worthy no
[45:42] man was worthy to take the book because
[45:43] only one was worthy was the lamb himself
[45:46] amen so when Christ pH say now I paid
[45:49] the price I'm taking the book now I got
[45:51] the book in my hand but it was still a
[45:53] closed
[45:54] book people didn't know what this book
[45:56] was really about out so for seven Church
[45:59] ages God was trying to unveil himself
[46:02] his people to to open his word little by
[46:05] little remember Paul was a prophet Paul
[46:08] knew about the serpent seed Paul knew
[46:10] but it was not time for for God to
[46:12] release himself
[46:14] fully to a people who could take all
[46:17] God's power so he worked seven Church
[46:19] ages to trying to get the people ready
[46:22] to take all of God's power but before
[46:25] God can get the power back to his people
[46:26] people he had to restore the word
[46:30] back remember because why it still was a
[46:32] closed book but when when God sent
[46:35] brother BR when God sent a prophet in
[46:37] this age Amen to open the book and open
[46:40] all the seals open all the M now now
[46:41] there's no more a closed book is an open
[46:43] book amen and so now when a so when a
[46:46] mighty angel came what in 1963 the
[46:49] mighty angel came
[46:52] down with open book in his hand what did
[46:56] he come down for to give the P all his
[46:58] power back to it Believers amen so
[47:01] that's why that's why we have a man born
[47:03] in sin cuz say he can he can speak to
[47:05] the storm just like AB said go storm go
[47:07] say storm go back you now God gave his
[47:10] power back to his Believers amen because
[47:13] of all the word have been restored back
[47:15] amen so
[47:17] now I'm ask you this question what's in
[47:19] your
[47:22] wallet what you doing with this kind of
[47:24] power that you have if no time to be
[47:26] crying say I Ain't Got You ain't got
[47:27] nothing speak now now you got the power
[47:29] to speak the word ain't got no job speak
[47:33] a job ain't got no joy speak Joy
[47:36] whatever the devil you lie I'm taking it
[47:38] back amen cuz I got the authority by the
[47:40] power of the Holy Ghost amen now what
[47:43] you do with this power amen what's in
[47:45] your wallet amen I know what's in my
[47:47] wallet but what's in your wallet
[47:52] amen we know what God done with brother
[47:54] Brandon we know what God done with Paul
[47:57] we know what God done with Moses but
[47:58] what God do with you amen cuz that same
[48:01] God Paul that same God that same God is
[48:03] here right now doing the very same
[48:06] things he's still parting the Red
[48:11] Sea he's still paying down Jericho walls
[48:15] he's still making a way amen cuz he's
[48:17] still God Amen praise God
[48:20] Amen remember the power is not coming
[48:24] the power is him amen but you need Faith
[48:27] to operate remember faith is a
[48:28] revelation KN I am a son or daughter of
[48:32] God and the Bible says if this what
[48:35] power power he says whatever you bind on
[48:37] Earth
[48:41] amen whatever you bind on Earth I will
[48:44] bind in heaven man because right now you
[48:46] got the authority Man by being born
[48:51] again amen so you more than you more
[48:54] than a human being you a super natur
[48:57] human you're a supernatural creature in
[48:58] a body of
[48:59] time praise God
[49:01] Amen I want I want refresh that St you
[49:04] got the power inside you right now to
[49:07] recreate your own world and live in it
[49:10] you got the power okay well I tell
[49:12] Church man if if you if you got a son
[49:15] that's bound say de Li I take my son
[49:17] back amen remember faith is a revelation
[49:20] amen and say if you if you say that's
[49:22] what say if you the Bible say if you say
[49:25] unto this mountain you can't move no
[49:27] mountain but God inside you can move any
[49:31] mountain is there anything too hard for
[49:35] God praise God Amen read coming to the
[49:38] close amen so so so when once you have
[49:41] that Authority remember when Christ it
[49:43] was finished it was already finished he
[49:46] said he had paid for all say I think
[49:48] think about Bible says um he was wounded
[49:50] for our
[49:52] transgressions God knew you was going to
[49:54] make mistakes the B say he was bruised
[49:56] for are our iniquities God know you
[49:58] going to f iniquity is do know to do
[50:01] something and don't even and know to do
[50:02] something and don't do it a man but God
[50:04] I got your covered amen everything you
[50:07] have in his life a Christian has God got
[50:09] your covered amen that's why you must
[50:11] rest your case and the finished work of
[50:14] Calvary amen you're not perfect but he's
[50:16] perfect
[50:17] amen I say you're not perfect but he's
[50:19] perfect amen and the perfect one is
[50:22] inside you amen praise God Amen go to
[50:25] one more scripture man eesi Ephesians 1
[50:28] show you something you just more than a
[50:29] human being you sit and realize that the
[50:31] power you Peter says we've been kept by
[50:34] the power of God so realize not your
[50:36] strength not your power is God not by
[50:38] power nor by might but my spirit say the
[50:40] Lord amen so that's I think about your
[50:42] pastor I think about Pastor Simmons my
[50:44] pastor brother Perry man all those been
[50:46] going for years man they what's keeping
[50:47] them is the power of the Holy Ghost amen
[50:50] and that power and that same power can
[50:51] have kept butra that same power can keep
[50:53] you amen cuz it's the same God Amen
[50:57] praise God Amen it's the same God Amen
[51:01] it's a different body but the same God
[51:04] they get the same result amen amen do
[51:06] you know you
[51:08] Overcomer do you know God chose you
[51:10] before the for the found word to be his
[51:12] bride do you know you kick the devil Out
[51:14] of Heaven
[51:16] amen you was with him
[51:19] then you was in God's mind before the
[51:21] you before the found you was in God's
[51:23] mind so when you kick when you kick
[51:26] Lucifer Heaven you so if you defeated
[51:29] them then you can defeat them right
[51:31] now different place but same results
[51:34] amen because the Holy Ghost can't lose
[51:36] amen praise
[51:37] God Amen go Ephesians Ephesians amen
[51:40] Ephesians so his power gives us our
[51:43] Authority amen so the Bible says by one
[51:47] Spirit we all baptized into not five
[51:50] bodies one body amen and that's the body
[51:52] of Christ amen but I ask a question who
[51:55] is the head of that body

[52:00] himself okay Accord to Ephesians 1
[52:02] Ephesians 1 I'm get you get get to see a
[52:06] visual picture of who you really are

[52:14] invincible Army you know why because

[1:01:39] but what we got the authority man
[1:01:40] there's a lot of he was the one who
[1:01:42] conquered he conquered and gave us the
[1:01:44] authority he's got the power but we got
[1:01:46] the authority just like an ambassador

[1:02:11] power he has
[1:02:13] Authority but but but but what I think

[1:02:16] a drunk at the
[1:02:18] house but when he put that suit on and
[1:02:21] put that badge on everything changes you
[1:02:24] about give him the UT respect

[1:02:30] Authority that you know that the state
[1:02:32] got your back amen but one thing about a
[1:02:35] poli they must not abuse their Authority
[1:02:38] amen amen a lot of people abuse their
[1:02:41] Authority and they get them in trouble
[1:02:43] cuz with authority you got boundaries
[1:02:46] because remember you have authority but
[1:02:48] you don't have the full
[1:02:49] power this because you got Authority
[1:02:51] don't make don't say you can do anything
[1:02:53] you want to do amen amen you must be
[1:02:55] governed by something it must be
[1:02:57] governed by the Holy Ghost amen so
[1:02:59] that's
[1:03:01] say say the power without character is
[1:03:04] satanic amen so God want to give you the
[1:03:06] power but you got to have the right
[1:03:08] character to use that power or you might
[1:03:11] destroy yourself it's somebody else
[1:03:13] amen that's why God makeing Mo you so so
[1:03:16] so when you get when you get the power
[1:03:17] you know what to do with the power amen
[1:03:20] and the power is to glorify and magnify
