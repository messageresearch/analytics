god look upon oh god your children everywhere oh god we commit this service into your hand in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you have your bibles turn with me to the book of acts acts one i want to read maybe one or two scriptures there and then we want to go to the book of second corinthians 11. the book of acts nine through eleven and when he had spoken these things while they behold he was taken up any cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfast toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said yemen of galilee why stand thee gazing up into heaven and that's why i wanna drop our thought this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner and you have seen him go into heaven i'm gonna go ahead and pray and let you be seated then we go to the book of second corinthians father god we thank you for your word tonight god may your blessed sanctified quicken it in jesus name amen let me recede it and turn with me to the book of second corinthians remember i want to draw my thoughts from acts 1 11 this same jesus not another jesus but this same jesus acts 11 second excuse me second corinthians 11 2-4 for i am jealous over you with godly jealous if i have a spouse you to one husband that i may present you as the chaste virgin to christ but i fear at least by any means as the serpent begal eve through his septility so your mind should be corrupt from the simplicity i like that the simplicity that is in christ for if he that cometh preaches another jesus whom we have not mispreached or if you receive another spirit which you have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might bear with him amen i'll say tonight i wanted you for a little thought just for a few minutes tonight and it was something that i was kind of sharing speaking down marion to the saints there and it was just my reading the weekend just kind of just stuck out to me and i began just to think about you know this same jesus this same jesus and paul here had picked it up you know and said uh several places through the scripture i'm not going to turn to galatians and first corinthians and different places in here and if you notice the bible the disciples they had one focus that they were pointing the people to i remember i thought about paul as he was in that religious system going about persecuting the early christians the church of that day and paul was a very staunch man that really didn't play with what he believed he was sincere he was dedicated to what he had been taught or what he had believed and paul went out carrying threatens and consenting even to stiffen death but one day something happened to saul while he was on his road to do another one of his religious uh duties amen and like i said we have a lot of sincere people but a lot of times you can be sincerely wrong and paul was one of those people that really was taught upon the gamaya one of the chief renowned men of that day and he had letters to go and uh carry out religious duties that his uh church he was affiliated with but he meant something along the way he met something that he wasn't expecting to meet amen amen and that something caused paul to be smitten blind and paul no doubt didn't know what hit him he fell down the beginning say who art thou lord amen and that voice spoke out saying i am jesus i like the way that voice when it comes and i want you to notice this if that any other voice that you hear not pointing you to jesus christ it's the wrong voice god saw the paul's heart he had chosen song to be a vessel but before god could use them paul god had to do something and i believe each and every one of us and we've been going our separate way one day something happened we were going about our careers we were going about our lives we've been going by doing different things but there was something that happened in our life and we had to look up to find out what wasn't going on and then you heard a voice and i want to tell you something that voice that you heard if you really ever heard that voice of god you can never be the same again you will never out you may not understand it you may can't explain it but it's something if it's god it'll cause something to happen in you i can never forget i could never forget because that day scene i believe that every one of us in particular you must meet that voice and that voice has a name one name the bible said in acts there is no other name given amongst men whereby you must be saved i'll be another player it said that god had had highly exalted him and given him a name above every name oh my no wonder people don't want to preach in that name god in this hour came and restored the truth the revelation of that name amen and he's showing the light on it and let us know that it's not three persons the one god but it's one guard with three attributes [Music] father above us son on earth in the holy ghost he's sent back to the church one god same in character same in power same in word same in life not two different standards one life one god one faith one baptism and under that name the bible say devils tremble the very purpose of this end time revelation god sent with us restore the truth because in the dark age of history they lost this light it got so bad the way there was doing all kinds of things in other people's names and god wouldn't identify himself with nothing else but his name that's why in matthew he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of he particular in a n-a-m-e what was he doing there's only one name i'm gonna recognize but the people that they seem to want to give the people a different name and in that name if it's not jesus christ the lord jesus christ though there may be a lot of good names in the earth that does have authority with it but there's no other power given the most men that you can be saved on the bible say in the early church to say they will call christians not a name like we got today in a different denominational systems but chris it was a universal church and god wanted them to to to be in unity under his spirit and get back to that one name that's why i was telling people i said that listen we're not pointing the people to the real source of life we failed as ministers depart the people to the real person not the one that came with the myth but the one that gave the message and the message was already written in the bible the bible said all scripture is given by inspiration by god and god let the truth of his word throughout every age to be made known to the people that were living in that particular generation but oh in that name there's deliverance there's healing in that name i like it in john and say in the beginning was the word see in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god another place we typically say great is the mystery of god god was see paul said the simplicity of the gospel see that's what make god so great because he comes so low and he hid himself in a vessel body called jesus christ and the very people that should knew who he was they said who is this why because he didn't come under their affiliation name but he came outside of every religious affiliation of that hour but he was the living representation of god in flesh reconciling the world back to himself everywhere jesus went he took no credit for him he said i can do nothing except my father showed me what a wonderful name that is a name sometimes i know he i say i do sometimes you can get so heavy burning down with things and you may not even find the words to pray but if you said oh jesus amen oh my dear late night album when everybody else was sleeping god wake you up and you begin to just you know go somewhere on your knees all you can say is jesus jesus you know i believe that early people at pentecost when they tear it though they have the maybe a little not clear to him but something happened to some of those people every day we can mark them that that wasn't it let me tell you something some of them live way better than we do with all the truth we got they met the person they met god and god made himself visible to them from that day they'll tell you i can never be the same again i wish we could get some of that the end time message people because we're missing something we've carried the people in all kind of isms and god said no no i don't recognize no other name than the name of the lord jesus christ that's where i put my approval you may call buddha and all kind of other names but god don't even pay attention to that amen he looking for his name that's why when you receive the holy ghost oh you just don't know what you have in your possession [Music] oh but the devil know you might not fully understand what you have but when it does click when it does or be made known revealed to you you understand that as jesus said when he went to the hell and he wrote he said all power in other words he realized what he had he understood even death couldn't hold his body down that's why death can't hold you down the devil used to torment us about it now we understood that listen that's not the end of it because if that same spirit dwell in you he will quicken your mortal body all it does is is change your dwelling place and it must be chained one way or the other but in that name there's so much power in that name why people don't want to call his name don't you know when you call anybody else's name more than you call jesus christ's name god is the jealous god come on god is jealous and we say he said i'll spouse you to one husband come on don't cut don't tell me that uh what we got going today no no no jesus christ is your husband amen paul begin to set that new testament into particular because paul already needs it now after my departure he said our grievous wolves preachers were going to come in and begin to scatter you here he said that to speak perverse things turning you from the lord jesus christ to somebody else but god wanted his hour get back to the word amen get back to your husband oh my i'll tell you the truth let me read something else quote me to the book of galatians that same jesus let me tell you something that the same jesus is right here tonight see people are looking for him there looking for him young he said what you looking for he said no no he's not there people looking for jesus in some a certain church or a certain place what you look at he said here i am right here i'm right here in my word see when jesus came he was the living reality of the word for that particular hour god had hid himself in a body called jesus and didn't even know that that was god on earth walking amongst them he did every work everything the scripture spoke of him jesus made it manifest [Music] and he never that's what i like about uh you know somebody at home but they never take credit for anything you can't take credit for nothing but you can pardon god damn it how did you made it through it was god brought me through how do you make it through what you're going through god done it paul said i am what i am by the grace of god you know what i know in this hour the yellow song said i can't even walk except you hold my hand let me tell you the older you get you understand that a little better you can't even get up except god gets you up you can't even talk except god give you a voice to talk you can't even breathe if god don't give a breath of life [Music] if i was whatever you're doing word or deed do it in what oh yeah whatever you get whatever god bless you with thank god for your mercy i don't have nothing to boast of my own god but i thank you for your grace amen for the girl to say that song all that belongs to you all of the glory oh not some all all that you are it belongs to him all what you have is because of him all that you have going to have is because of him all that you are it's not your marriage but it's the grace of god in your life that's why we all walk in such a humility of the grace of god because we have been privileged people oh my god we have been privileged people to be partakers of this heavenly gift that god has given to you now he could have given to anybody else oh god but i thank you that you didn't pass me by lord god i thank you you saw fit as wretched and undone as i have god you saw fit to give somebody like [Music] look what kind of people we were i was telling the church back home marrying called home and i was telling i say you know if you understand the birth of jesus where he was born at he was born in one of the lowest places that a baby could be born it wasn't a pretty hospital roses but it was a stable actually like a cave where they kept animals cow were in there it was it stunk in here but that's where our king went to be born why did he went so low look at it again he was hiding himself in this you know kings don't be born that way they be born in some place that royal but not no not god he went to the lowest you know why because we were so low and he wanted to identify with us how low we were yet he came down to see about us sister shaw let's say it makes me want to shout when i think about all that he's done for us when i think about how low he went he went uh or did that nobody else would do amen and he did it oh how he must love us and he demonstrated that because you were on my mind i'm not going to lose you i know you may be messed up i know you got a laughing in your life but i went to the lowest to be born in a stinking manger for you what kind of love is that what kind of love is that bro that's love for that song saying that's love come on he he hung his head he was script beaten not because of what he did because he done nothing now he became sin not that he was but he became for us what was he doing he was taking our place oh my and then people turn down this great grace of god because they don't fully understand what calvary meant to them what it meant you were made free the penalty that we were under he said i come to lift that off of you and you don't have to do that no more i wish the world could really catch this okay not something high but it's simple amen what happened has that the religious people have really made this gospel some weakened down thing as some social but no don't let them do that to you let me tell you something because what he did it was great do it was free it cost something it caused a life to be laid down for us that's why you don't take this for granted you know you cherish yes you may have some time the way things get low but when i think about the goodness of god and all he is done for you lord have mercy i see why the sovereign god said he said we ought to be the most happiest people but we don't fully understand what we got but when you fully understand church that nothing can harm you [Music] ever god got your back no matter what you're going through no matter what you're dealing with god is your protector the book of hebrews 13 says jesus christ is the what the same i like that that's why if you sick come on god is a healer [Music] he never lost the power come on we're not looking at some so some empty tune that we don't know no no no no no heroes and he didn't rules weak he wrote with all power the devil knew he never thought man if i would have known this is going to happen i may would have been your good body but i crossed off have you crucified figure that i was gonna be done with it oh my but in his death he conquered more in his life because in the earthly ministry he was on earth but when he died and rose again now everything over the whole earth was under his authority lord i wish i had voices galatians we're going to close you know i'm learning and i'm understanding i know right now we're in a cycle to where everything seemed to be going on and just one blow after the other one thing after another temperature seven i said he likes calling when i said are you tired as i am and you say a little because there's so much going on you can't keep up with what's going on and so what's going on all over the place i mean you wonder lord what's really going on but i understand one thing we got to make our call in our election sure i'll tell the people back home remember and i said listen if there's ever a day you want to know what you're doing is right by god and be sure you get a checkup and don't check your neighbor out check yourself we must examine our own self you got to know sister brother where i stand with you god do i have enough to make it through in this hour cause they're gonna take something more it's gonna take something more than just coming to church it's gonna take something more than just singing and clapping we got to have something that can anchor us because the storms are blowing and we're going to need an anchor that when that storm blow you might rock and you might lean but your soul is anchored and let me tell you something you don't hold the anchor but the anchor holds you this flesh we gotta want to give up because they go through so much sometimes sometimes people like to say what's the use it's like nothing seems to go let me tell you everything the server goes to everything is going exactly the way god intended for it he said nothing is out of care because god knows everything nothing is out of order we think this and that no no god got a purpose behind everything he allows to take place once you understand the purpose of god in your life you'll understand lord whatever you're doing in this season lord don't do it without me oh my i feel i feel i feel maybe i feel by myself but that's all right this is the individual journey anyhow and we're not so much about feeling but i know there's something going on it's later than we think be sure you got oil be sure you got oil and be sure you got enough because it might be then got a little low you need to get a double potion you need to get a a a re-uh dedication [Music] i look at the bible days and i saw that after the pastor didn't have to see the holy ghost and then they start going through great persecution and things were going on in that hour you know what they did this pray lord we need another dose and the bible said the holy ghost came and it shook the place i wish that we could get that tonight i wish we could get that kind of mind that lord we are facing rebelling demon power lord we need another dose come on we need another dose come on we never been uh cooling off too long we need another dose light us again lord i'm not gonna even try to read it light us again we need a fire and not a painted fire but we need a fire you need your own fire amen amen come on we can't live off nobody else fought here no more we can't live off what god used to do and what he has done all the things that we make us say that the prophet is i would do that's good but where is yours yeah where is your testimony what has god been doing with us because it's not enough just to read what he used to do to remember the bible say hebrew jesus christ is so if he is he got to be doing something now come on let's get with it come on he got to be doing something now if he is the same what has he done for you that's what i want to know we don't even have testimony services let the people become seen that everybody see i'm going through you're supposed to but what god is doing he's trying to purge those things out of you the way you can get to the next level what is he doing he's beating all the drops [Music] he's beating all of the arrogancy and the pride and and that fleshly and god will try to humble you so you can look up tonight appreciate you pray that god and disturb us again i'm just not praying but god is stirring i believe that was that solomon say once more lord samson amen amen one more time i don't believe we got got another time lord once more i believe this is the season to be blessed this is the day that god is gonna have a bride and she gonna know what god want done with the word not just to quote it back and just the debate or what he said but god is looking for a manifestation of the word for this hour when jesus come he was god's manifestation of the word for that hour and his broadeness hour is a very manifestation of the word that god has spoken god bless you tonight [Applause] praise god thank god for the word tonight that same jesus you see going up in like mine he's coming back amen it's taken up in a cloud but the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout amen amen i thank god he's has descended with the shout now in this hour the shout amen the message has gone out praise god what is it doing to gather the bride together amen those that have an ear to hear amen they can hear what the spirit has to say to the church that's why we came out of revelation 18. we came out of babylon amen because god called us out amen amen because there has been a descendant amen he that this sin is the same that
