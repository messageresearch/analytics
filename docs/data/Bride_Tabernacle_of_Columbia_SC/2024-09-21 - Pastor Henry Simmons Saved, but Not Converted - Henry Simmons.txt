for an opportunity to come into your house as David said I was happy I was glad when they said it let us go into the house of the Lord father I just pray that the Holy Spirit would come speak to us Lord for for certainly their needs Lord and you said but my God shall supply all of your needs according to his riches and Glory so father we have needs tonight and Lord God you can touch heal and deliver you can save and set free whatever the needs are God may you meet every need in Jesus name bless your word amen Amos 3 and 7 uh 3 and 6 Amos 3 and 6 it says shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people be not afraid afraid shall there be evil in this city and the Lord has not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His Secrets unto his servants the prophets God bless you the read you may be seated we were talking on last night surely the Lord God would do nothing but he Reveals His secrets to his servant the prophet so surely the Lord God will do nothing and the top is surely the Lord God would do nothing it's a conjunction he said but he Reveals His secrets to servants and Prophet now if we turn to Luke 17 Luke 17 our expectation you know we might want to imagine um how it was in the Bible days well we never got out of the Bible days we're in the Bible days though the Bible was written you know some what the final W in was about over 2,000 years ago yet the Bible what was written was foretelling things so there was a a writing of the word and there's a fulfillment of the word so what was written had time for it to be fulfilled so by the grace of God let us look at how the Bible days was back then and notice and uh Luke 17:26 Luke 17:26 he says and it it was in the days of noi so shall it be also in the days of the son of man so like it was then so it would be in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the AR and the flood came and destroyed them all it says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold and they planted and they build but the same day the lot went out of Sodom one day God's going to take his bride away now we know Abraham was the type of the bride and and not lot are you with me remember two angels went down to Sodom right the prophet of gin is the type of or Roberts Billy Graham the Pentecost is and the fundamentals are you with me so we we we're seeing things happen that they would right they will lead the the arm of the world you know the Angels had to Smite blind the people in Sodom and gamorra because there was so much the men wanted to go with the angels and lot said I got some daughters here virgin daughters want you have them and they said no we want them men as it was back then so it is today likewise as it was in the days of lot and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be here now okay he says the same day the lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed you wonder why things are happening like it happens before judgment can strike it has to be the world has to get in a condition that warrant judgment before God will punish there must be condition met for punishment so judgment is going to strike you know you don't take your children and you want to punish them for they when they hadn't done nothing but when they've done something that's really bad then you need to correct them amen I think the world is in bad shap but the Bible says surely the Lord God will do nothing but let see we have to take the example that God what God did back then the Bible says Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and so I'm God and I change I don't change God don't change he don't change what God did then God weighs a perfect you can't better God if he did it this way then he'll keep on doing it the same way how come people expecting God to do something different from the way he's already done it always done so the way God warned people if God going to destroy the Earth with fire if the people say amen that the world is going to be destroyed This Time by fire not by water and God going to destroy the world God would always give man opportunity to repent a chance to repent but a man does not take the opportunity of repentance then judgment has the strike an individual in their life God will warn them and tell them warning after warning he speaks to them he speaks to him in the car wreck he speaks to him in the you know something you know a sickness at your body he speaks to you tell you amen you can go at any time he keeps Waring man he wants individuals he wants young people the young the elderly people he wants the middle age he wants it all and then sometimes he speaks and sometimes it's not with a voice it's it it's what a an happening something happens to try to get your attention amen God is talking to you but sometimes we said we go ahead on as though nothing happened nobody said anything but God says I'm talking to you amen that little small steel voice says I'm speaking to you if you don't get this try to correct it if you don't repent if you keep going in that way I have to bring judgment but sometimes man just as though they hear nothing they think they shake it off they just shake it off and God is wanting repent amen you know sometimes God says hey don't do that don't don't don't don't go and tax yourself don't go beyond your means and sometimes he said well I need I like that that that that new car I'mma get it I like that new house I'm GNA get it God said don't don't do that it's it's going to it's too expensive you're not going to be able to make it but what we do we override the voice of God so I'm saying like it is every day in our lives people override God's voice now God's voice he can speak with the art of a voice as the prophet say he can write with a finger he wrote the Ten Commandments he wrote on the wall meaning meaning God can talk he talked to Moses he talk you know Jesus on when he's on the mountain of the configuration he said this is my beloved Son John the Baptist he said you know he spoke whom I pleased to dwell God can talk God can write amen amen but he uses what he uses prophets he could write the word but he let let Moses Moses was way back Moses wasn't there in Genesis was he how can he write about Adam and Eve in the garden and all of that amen was he there you think God let him go back there and let him write about where the took place a prophet being a seal can look back and can look forward amen are you with me amen and then he can start writing and God can start speaking to him Moses this is what happened he could see it and write it the same time cuz he was a seal surely the Lord God could do nothing so here he is writing the five books of the Bible how you know whether or not is right we understand that all scriptures are given by inspiration of God Amen God inspired amen and no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation amen God himself was writing but he was using the prophet he was using Moses he was using Isaiah amen if God can do that that's the way he works amen he used Prophets The Bible this is this is gone in letter form amen but it's gone are you with me amen so what happens amen surely the Lord God would do nothing amen we look at God and we understand do we understand how God's work you know sometimes we just think it's just a church we come to church and we go in and out the Bible it's just a book it's not a book it's the word of God it's God Amen it tells you what's going to happen amen and how it's going to happen amen but sometimes we it it's sealed from us to the angel had to come down and tell Mary Mary you highly favored Mary you are the word that's going to be manifested for this hour amen you the Virgin that uh you're going to conceive amen so you the word that God is going to reveal and manifest itself through at this particular time amen and you must know what scriptures amen your faith can anoint amen your faith can believe and expect it to happen for this particular season amen amen because you are you at the place where God comes down reveals himself to you amen amen God sends a prophet to wake you up to the age or the period of time that you're living in and in the expectation what God is expecting of you amen are you with me so God tells you what I'm expecting of you for the age you live in in the early church Paul amen was a a messenger to the Gentiles he was amen was a get the Gentile amen Church started out amen as a wise master builder I've laid the foundation amen amen are you with me amen Paul knew amen the foundation had to be laid amen and you know we built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being what the Chief Cornerstone I said surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His secrets to his servants the prophet amen God revealing himself in his own word are you with me but it's God it's it God was revealing himself it was not Moses it was God in Moses but God was revealing himself through Moses because he said a prophet shall the Lord God raised up like unto me am amen God was revealing himself when Jonah Jonah went down to nin and told him to repent amen praise God but Jonah didn't want to go he went in the wh belly and the fish belly and was down amen and amen for three days but he was it wasn't Jonah it was God In Jonah even when Jonah amen went the wrong direction God showed through Jonah amen the wicked and the doter generation seeketh out a sign but I ain't going to give you nothing but the sign of Jonah amen amen are you with me so I'm saying to you God Amen is working but amen the people Miss what God is doing amen amen amen they're not conscious though he tell tells them they don't want to receive it because amen it's the word becomes alive amen amen and when the word becomes alive people don't they miss it amen because it's manifesting now it's off the pages it's walking on to feet amen amen he said Abraham desire to see my day and he saw it he was glad amen he said you ain't 50 years old how come you saying what you're saying and you're not even 50 years old are you with me but he said before Abraham was I am I am I spoke in the bush M Bush I am that I am am are you with me oh man they took up Stone they want to kill him let's kill this man you know what he doing he making mockery of the word brother and sister when you recognize who you are and what God is requiring of you amen you know it's no more church then amen it's manifestation time amen it's the scriptures becoming life and you know amen that you expecting just like Mary was expecting a they didn't want to believe Mary was uh the Virgin amen but Mary knew herself and as the word was in Mary so the word is in the bride are you with me so what Mary had to go through her persecution amen she said now watch amen they said I can't believe that do you you been you you got an ill legitimate child but uh Joseph amen he wanted to put it away priv privately because but God Amen had done something amen when Mary aen the angel met how can this thing be see out not on on my hand he said I'm going to tell you how it's going to happen and the bride has been instructed how it's going to happen how you going to have your body changed amen amen how amen you going to have your translation amen so God instructs you come down manifest himself tell you what to expect amen praise God so Mary amen though she had to be persecuted though Noah you think Noah building a big boat talking about something that never happen it's going to rain and you think those people believe Noah but he said as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Sodom they don't believe that Los Ang just one they going to go they don't believe all this filth and garbage that people feing out all over the world one day judgment is going to strike amen they don't believe it but it's something about you and I we believe the word we believe it's going to happen we believe God coming to get you you believe the Rapture going to take place you believe that you're going to have a body change amen hallelujah amen oh yes we're Believers amen the world don't believe it that's why they keep eating drinking being married and they ain't worried about a thing but we're here we're not worried we're confident that God is coming back for us amen amen we had confidence because we are a sure word of Prophecy we got amen thus said the Lord amen and we got a Vindicated word in this hour amen amen praise God and God is bringing his word to pass praise God you're not looking for the Rapture anymore amen you're a part of the Rapture are you with me and you because you have been chosen to be a part of it amen just like Mary was chosen in her day you have been chosen in this day amen amen God has reveal to you who you are amen and you bringing forth Jesus Christ in broad form are you with me and that's what it is Jesus Christ again manifesting himself again in brde form surely the Lord God will do nothing amen but he Reveals His secret so Jonah amen War the people didn't he to repent and they did but in the days of Noah what did they do they laugh they laugh but you know you folks laugh at you because you're getting ready to go to heaven you prep preparing yourself to go to heaven the whole world don't believe amen that God has chosen you at this particular season and time and that you can prepare yourself for for glory amen on a on an exodus not on a a a a boat a Ark but in Amen in a body changing experience through one of those lights going to drop down and pick you up one day and you'll be changed in the moment of a twinking of L youfo sick coming to get [Music] you yeah one day that that light going to come and we'll be beamed up praise God and the moment in the twinking of ey this where did you go where did Christy go she was beam boom it hit and we were gone Hallelujah L said I know she was right here I knew he was right there what way did he go uh list a this just a figment of imagination I didn't really happen and they goe on and you see what I'm saying the world don't believe that it could happen just like that but you have faith and confidence that that's why I'm not coming to church going through the motion amen I'm I God didn't save me for nothing he saved me that I might play my part in this mystery amen I got a you know the puzzle is a mystery but the puzzle has to be put together amen amen and every piece fit fits perfect and you fit perfect in the puzzle of the Pyramid of God Amen the mountain Holy Mountain are you with me amen you fit perfect but you got to know your Place amen amen in the hand of God through the Holy Ghost positionally place you in the puzzle amen are you with me amen you cannot Place yourself amen but he places you amen as you yield to the spirit of God then God himself will give you amen praise Goden he would illuminate you praise God he would Quicken you amen he

Lord with visions amen and then people look look at Moses Moses what you going to do amen but Moses called for an exodus and God said there in Revelation 18 let's just look there for just minute I'm going to close and be real short tonight I didn't thought I'd be about 15 minutes that's it took Gardon longer than that to get to church come from home I got I got to Extended a little bit he said and after these things oh excuse me after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon is falling graveling the great is falling is falling and has become the habitation of devils and the whole of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth of wax Rich through the abundance of her delicacy and I heard another voice from Heaven saying what out my people and it says come out of her my people that you rece that you be not partakers of her sin and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached into heaven and God has remembered her iniquities reward reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works and the cup which she has filled F to her double amen look at what she did it says how much she has glorified who she glorified who herself glorified herself and that's what the world is doing people look they're all into self in this church this mystery of Babylon amen this one World Church that God calls us out from her this one world order that God calls us out of her amen that we've been warned a prophet is a judgment sign is and he comes to warn the people and I believe that's what has happened in our day don't we have heard a warning a warning that would save us if we repent and we turn from our Wicked Ways and turn to the Lord with all our hearts we've heard the warning we've heard the the the trumpet blow we've heard amen God call you and I out come out from among them be you separate said the
