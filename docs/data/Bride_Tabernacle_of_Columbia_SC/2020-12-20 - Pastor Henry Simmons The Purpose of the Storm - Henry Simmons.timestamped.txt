[40:19] went down into it to go with them to
[40:24] tares from the presence of the Lord
[40:28] but the Lord sent out a great wind into
[40:32] the
[40:33] sea and there was a mighty Tempest in
[40:37] the
[40:38] sea so that the ship was
[40:43] aike to be broken may God bless you the
[40:46] reading of his
[40:47] [Music]
[40:50] word know what look like we getting feed
[40:53] by your
[40:55] verb so
[40:58] the ship was about to
[41:00] break and God sent a storm
[41:07] sometimes and we
[41:10] wonder why the
[41:15] storm when God send your a storm your
[41:21] way sometimes we wonder
[41:26] why I know Paul says all things work
[41:29] together to
[41:31] good to them that love the
[41:34] Lord to them who are the
[41:37] call according to his
[41:40] purpose and I said the
[41:43] purpose of the
[41:49] storm the purpose of the storm I hope
[41:53] that we can get these two passages of
[41:56] scriptures together together and kind of
[41:59] understand what some of us are going
[42:03] through and some have been
[42:06] through sometimes the church go through
[42:09] his
[42:11] storms families go through their
[42:19] Stones it's not going to be
[42:24] safe sailing all the time
[42:28] sometimes the waters going to get
[42:34] treacherous
[42:36] sometimes things are not going to go the
[42:38] way we feel like they ought to
[42:43] go sometimes the the temp
[42:48] temps are come sometimes the waters that
[42:52] get trouble
[42:57] but I I want to know how do you deal
[42:59] with your
[43:04] stone and you ask the question why why
[43:08] why did God send this wind this way why
[43:11] did God send these amen these battles
[43:15] and these troubles my
[43:17] way why did God send
[43:20] this
[43:24] wave that is tossing against the ship of
[43:26] my
[43:27] life why did God send it my
[43:32] way
[43:35] here the Book of Matthew 7 and
[43:41] 24 a little
[43:44] subtopic uh brother Mickey from uh
[43:48] Oregon would often times say every time
[43:50] I talk to him he says the ankle HS
[43:59] The Tempest is Raging but the anchor
[44:03] hes brother and sister I just use for a
[44:08] little subtopic D AER
[44:13] holes the Billows are
[44:16] beating but the ankle is still
[44:21] hes it says here 24 and7
[44:27] therefore whosoever Hearth these says of
[44:30] [Music]
[44:32] mine and doth them I will like unto a
[44:38] wise
[44:39] man which buil his house upon a
[44:44] rock and the rains
[44:47] descended the floods came the winds blew
[44:51] and beat upon the
[44:53] house and it fell not for it was founded
[44:56] upon on a
[44:59] rock purpose of the storm sometimes to
[45:03] see if the house is built right or
[45:10] not we know
[45:14] that our lives are locking into
[45:18] a we are locking into a
[45:23] house the church itself is the house of
[45:26] God
[45:28] God you and I are the Temple of the
[45:31] Living
[45:33] God but sometimes God want to
[45:37] test amen your foundation
[45:41] out God want to see whether or not amen
[45:47] uh whether you a real Christian or
[45:52] not whether you got the goods or not
[45:55] whether you got what you say you
[45:59] have whether you believe him or
[46:03] not God B the children of Israel out but
[46:07] he tested their
[46:10] faith God did great and wonderful things
[46:13] for them and bringing them out of Egypt
[46:15] and taking them through the Red Sea but
[46:17] yet amen God wanted to prove
[46:22] them sometimes the storm is to prove you
[46:30] amen will you still stand amen when the
[46:33] Storm
[46:36] come many folks amen when their Storm
[46:41] come they run from the presence of
[46:45] God Jonah was a man
[46:48] that amen when he
[46:51] faced the word of God he wanted God
[46:55] wanted him to do something that he
[46:57] didn't want to
[46:59] do you know we take our lives and we put
[47:02] them in our own
[47:05] hand but you say to the Lord where you
[47:08] lead me I'll follow I wonder sometimes
[47:12] do we know the leadership of the Lord or
[47:16] not I wonder sometimes are we leading
[47:19] ourselves uh and are we following our
[47:21] own thoughts and ideas or are we giving
[47:25] a prayerful
[47:27] are we praying and say God God me I find
[47:31] myself on my knees crying out God Amen I
[47:35] I don't want to do my will I want to do
[47:37] your
[47:41] will God what would you have me to
[47:45] do God how do you want me to handle this
[47:48] situation or that situation God I want
[47:51] to I I don't have time to fail
[47:55] now amen I come too far Amen to go in
[47:59] the wrong
[48:04] direction but Jonah
[48:07] said I don't want to do amen what God
[48:11] told me to do so I think I'll take a
[48:15] ship and I'll flee from the presence of
[48:18] the
[48:19] Lord amen because
[48:22] I sometimes Amen in justifying himself
[48:26] he don't think amen what God has given
[48:29] him is
[48:31] fa these Wicked
[48:35] people wicked wicked wicked
[48:40] Nal it's almost
[48:43] lot unto nonon with his leprosy he
[48:46] didn't want to go dip in mud of
[48:49] Jord amen
[48:52] that the word sometimes is heavy
[48:57] sometimes the word is difficult to
[49:00] Bear sometimes we don't want to do what
[49:03] the word say because it doesn't make
[49:06] sense to
[49:10] you amen God said it and it don't make I
[49:14] don't understand it not one bit he
[49:17] didn't say to you non I I understand
[49:20] what I say he said do what I say
[49:27] yeah sometimes we trying to figure out
[49:30] what God is saying in the word instead
[49:32] of obeying the
[49:34] word if I don't understand it if I don't
[49:38] see it I won't believe
[49:41] it but he said Thomas because you didn't
[49:45] see amen you said I won't believe I said
[49:49] blessed is he that has not seen but yet
[49:53] he believes
[50:01] why do God send
[50:04] Stones how do we deal with the
[50:08] stone or do do we deal with it
[50:12] as God testing our ankle and does our
[50:15] ankle
[50:17] hold
[50:19] no are we foolish or are we
[50:23] wise praise God because when God sent a
[50:27] storm in our
[50:29] marriage we get a
[50:35] divorce amen God is DET testing the
[50:39] marriage and will the marriage with an
[50:44] ankle will we say in better or worse in
[50:49] sickness or in
[50:51] health or when God sent a storm by
[50:57] amen we said let's get out of
[51:00] this amen we want to run from the
[51:06] word amen the word and our vow that we
[51:10] made to one another we run from the
[51:13] presence of the
[51:15] Lord instead of dealing with it and
[51:18] praying and asking God to am may give me
[51:21] Grace to run this race I made a
[51:24] commitment God to you
[51:27] are you with me and God I said I go with
[51:30] you all the
[51:33] way sickness in
[51:36] Hell amen I said unto death do us part
[51:39] and I don't want death to separate us
[51:43] amen because uh Paul says I I let
[51:45] nothing not death nor life nor angels
[51:48] nor principalities nor powers I'm not
[51:52] I'm not going to let nothing separate me
[51:55] from the love of God

[52:56] amen a powerful
[53:00] stone look like amen the house is
[53:03] getting
[53:04] shaken amen because God send hurricanes
[53:09] sometime amen I believe that Jon did
