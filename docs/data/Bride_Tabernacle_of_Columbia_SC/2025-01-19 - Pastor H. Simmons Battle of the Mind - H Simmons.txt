unto the wildness of pan and Kadesh and bought back the word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruits of the land and they told him and said we came into the land with thou sent us and surely it flowed with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are wall and very great and moreover we saw the children of Ang there and the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jedu sites and the amorites dwelt in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it may God bless you read you may be seen and 31st verse it says it's Caleb said we were will well able to overcome it 31 says but the men that went up with him said we be not what we may not able to go up against this people the people for they are what stronger than I'm talking about this morning mind battles we know that the greatest battle ever fought is fought within our minds but I'm finding that people uh they're losing they're losing their minds really amen and um the Mind battles that folk have is secret battles people have a lot of Secrets B battles that they're fighting and sometimes uh the secret battles that they're fighting you don't know amen until they lost to battle blessing amen you don't know about their battles their secret battles they in with battles you don't know until they have really really lost a battle amen see sometimes when they're battling and they're warn amen see you can lose a battle but you don't have to lose the wall am but I'm afraid people have given up and saying that the uh that they've already lost the wall amen there's no hope there's no way I'm going to be able to to overcome this and so people have given up in defeat and they've given up in their minds so amen they cannot win they cannot go any further because their minds were not allow them to go any further because amen they're defeated within their minds and when you defeated within your mind you have no desire to press forward amen see if your mind tell you you can't get up out the bed then you'll never get up out the bed amen amen Jesus if your mind tell you you can't stop drinking you'll never stop drinking amen if your mind tell you you can't stop you can't do without smoking smoking you'll never stop smoking see it's all in your mind if your mind tell you I can do all things through Christ has strengthen me amen I can't overcome amen we find that people amen think they have strong minds but they have inward Secrets amen they have secrets outwardly they they appear to be strong but inwardly they're weak yes and the Bible says the strong are about the infirmities of the weak amen amen then we ought to be you know we ought to ask for help amen amen but but but because we have this P Persona that we're so strong and outwardly we have folks that look up to us but yet inwardly amen we know amen that we are going through things that amen we seem to amen can't conquer we're going through mind battles we're going through things amen get that somewhat disturbs us and the things that we're going through in our mind we seem like we cannot overcome these mind battles Jesus the secrets that we hold within our mind amen sometimes we have secret faults sometimes we have things that are HIIT hidden from the public and hidden from the eyes but yet they were in with battles and we want to deal with the inward battles because I find that I when I see Christians that are on the sideline and they're not in church anymore and they're not pressing anymore it's because amen they have seen the lost the battle Jesus and I'm trusting this morning those that have lost the battle amen can say Amen that there's still uh there's still a god that is able for me to win the war I've lost some battles but amen I

Anakin the son that we saw the Giants the son of anch which come of the Giants and we were in our own eyes our own sight see and no way you can see how you going to stop with your secret affair no way you're going to stop with your secret affair because how do you see that secret affair we saw the an we saw the Giants we saw giants and we in our own eyes were like grasshoppers you saw your situation that you were in you saw it Greater it was too hard it was too difficult it was too much for you to handle so you accepted defeat you accepted the situation in the state that you were in you want you didn't see how you could get out of it so you accepted the 14th uh chapter the first vers and all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried and the people wept that night what you believe and what you're preaching and what you living is affecting other people lives the voice that's in you it's affecting other people lives what you believe where you are in the spirit is affecting other people lives amen are you with me amen it's not only affecting you but it's affecting other folk so their weakness what they were going through was causing other folks to fail look how a 10 affected two million it was only 10 but look what kind of ramification it had on two million are you with me see you might your secret see their hearts be they began to speak what was in their hearts for out of the abundance of the heart the M would speak ain't that right so they begin to release what was in the inside of them are you with me and when they began to speak their mind are you with me they were speaking their mind the battle that was going on in their mind they begin to expose what was in their mind how many of you know they had a weak mind amen amen amen their minds were weak and their minds in their minds they didn't have faith amen they didn't have faith to trust God and take him at his word amen they listen to The Devil's lie amen amen see amen it's the six sense that we got to look to not these five senses they saw it so they believe what they what what they saw you see the word and you believe what you don't see amen because faith is the victory that overcomes your flesh overcomes the word it's not what you see is what you believe amen and if you can believe God Amen you can have Victory amen but you must believe amen yes oh Jesus amen amen thank you amen amen the effect that you have on others you begin to release your thoughts let me just go on and the next verse and all the children of Israel mured against Moses it's easy to forget what what God done for you they Ming against Moses sometimes folks get upset with the pastor they got upset with the fivefold ministry amen they mured against Moses oh Moses amen we come out of Myster of Babylon we come out for what to die in this Wilderness hallelujah praise got uh-uh brother and sisters mured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would the god that we had what died inpt died in the land of Egypt see when you defeated in your mind you can't go no further once you defeated in your mind now the effect that they had the gospel which they were preaching caused two million people to be lost and I'm going to tell you something everybody that come out with the message of the hour in that day all of those preachers that came out it was 70 with Jesus and 12 left and one among the devil in the second Exodus in the Third Exodus what about it it be the same way in this Third Exodus amen are you up me people can go but so far but when they got up to kades spia they failed are you with me they can go so far with the message and with the messenger but they can't go all the wayen are you with Meen oh brother and sister people fail to go all the way am it says we would have died in he says would the god that we had died in the land of Egypt and would god with the God we had died in the wilderness Lord have mercy can't you see the condition you know I I can you know just spend time to telling you that story because you know I was down on my knees and just praying I said God look at this look at this see the Mind battles I see I I'm troubled I I I I'm deeply troubled because I see what people are going through the young people are going through I see what the old older people are going through I I see people that are going through a different uh uh mind battles amen I see people in their body they can't do nothing but in their mind they all about the Mind become corrupt are you with me and when you see some many losing their mind I said God I got to speak on mind battles I got to talk about these mind battles that people are having but they're having a secret affair with unbelief what the devil they can't seem to overcome people are coming to church they're shouting and they're speaking in tongues and they are praising God and they're saying I got Victory but inside they're having a private affair they inwardly they're defeated outwardly they some people amen they try to even deceive their own self praise God they know what they going through but yet they try to be strong on the outside but inside they're weak they need help amen praise God see sometimes you got to come and get on that alt and cry to God and you got to tell God Lord I'm in a condition that I need help amen Lord I need you to help me amen you see I find those that with the religious spirits and self-righteous Spirits they would never try to show anybody that they're weak they're always with their head and shoulders above everybody that's why I always ask y'all to pray for me pray for me I said if I have needed prayer I need prayer and when you see a soldier fall when you you see a soldier overtake you in a fault don't you don't you get all like you all high and mighty amen it's time for you to say Lord it could have been me it could have been me but I'm not going to put my hand on oh oh look what happened to do oh they ain't got nothing I thought no it could have been me amen but it's your mercy Lord that keeping me it's because of your mercy that we are kept it's because of the grace of God that God protects us and keeps us and we ought to say thank you Jesus Lord what can I do for my brother what can I do for my sister how can I help how can I be an encouragement to them I don't know you was like that you become Untouchable contagious you got spiritual leprosy are you with me instead of saying God that's my brother that's my sister I want to help them God how can I be a help how can I be an encouragement how can I get them out of this dark place people are in Dark Places they're in Dark Places and amen if God don't help them somebody that said he strong if they don't come pull them out of those dark places they go deeper and deeper into the darkness are you with me and those Dark Places amen they they they're responsible for having a secret affair amen the things that they are being faced with and the battles that they are going through in their mind praise God they think that I can't have hand of the battles that's going through in my mind I can't handle it I can't deal with it and because I can't deal with these battles it results into backsliding the results of doing things that I I don't want to do going places where I don't want to go I become weak because I'm dealing with battles that I can't understand and don't know why I'm battling these things I'm telling you something I know where they came from see you got to understand where did it come from you got to understand the roots of it prophet of God a lot of times he had to go back to the root you got to go back to the root what did this thing come from on my knees he said that's the problem where is the root of it what I'm going through where is the root of it am amen amen can I find the root of what's sicknesses that's going on in my body the pains where did it come from I didn't always I wasn't always like this I wasn't always sick I wasn't always going through this particular battle well where did it come from can I find it if I can find where it came from I can send it back where it came from and got I want you to start sending it back I want you to start sending it back where it came from are you with me do you want these demons to go back where they came from or you going to accept them your secret affair do you want to get rid of it praise God and die to it praise God you want to kill it you want to send it back where it came from or you going to accept it and let it kill you if you don't destroy the Devil the devil will destroy you amen he said for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might what destroy the what the works of the devil isn't that right I said if you don't destroy his Works he sure will destroy you are you with me I'm I'm talking about the manifestation of the sons of God I'm talking about people that's going to take God at his word and said devil you got to go back cuz why you came from you don't belong here hallelujah you don't belong here I'm not going to accept you praise God the land belongs to God see when they went into the land said the land you know everything God said he was going to be to us he is that he's Joy he's peace he's love he's everything are you with me the land was flowing with milk and honey right right but that sister s s that brother s s Hittites pites certain spirits in the land you looking at other folk instead of looking at your promise are you with me you looking at people that's been defeated people that had problem amen instead of looking at your promise amen amen that's what happens and what we doing we we begin to back up because God didn't promise you all these problems and all these headaches what God I tell you what why Moses didn't tell us why God didn't tell us that that that they were going to be Giants and they're going to be hites and pites and J J sites and all of that why didn't tell us and then we get over there yeah the land's good but look at what we got to defeat see when you get saved and God feel you I didn't say fill you with the Holy Ghost anoint you with the Holy Ghost cuz I said feel that that's going too far but God anoint you with the Holy Ghost are you with me till you say I'm filled with the Holy Ghost then you oh you talking about something powerful
