[34:29] praise God God is good amen amen Second
[34:33] Kings
[34:38] 6 and
[34:42] 16 you understand that Elijah and his
[34:45] servant was
[34:47] out and uh the Syrian Army was all
[34:51] around the city where they were because
[34:54] Elijah was telling the king the king
[34:58] of Israel what was going on and with the
[35:03] Assyrians and they could understand how
[35:05] come they knew everything they were
[35:08] doing so here he says they discovered
[35:13] that it was Elijah that was telling
[35:15] it so they wanted to do something about
[35:19] it and they
[35:21] sent a great task of army to
[35:26] confront and the deal with Elijah and he
[35:30] answered fear
[35:33] not Elijah's servant he he was wondering
[35:37] what we going to do he let's read the
[35:39] 15th verse and when the servant of the
[35:42] man of God was risen early and gone
[35:46] forth and behold and host can pass the
[35:49] city both of horses and chariots and his
[35:53] servant said unto him Elias my master
[35:58] how shall we
[36:00] do and he answered fear not for they
[36:05] that be with us are more than them that
[36:10] what be with
[36:13] them and Elijah prayed and said
[36:18] Lord and said Lord I pray thee what open
[36:25] his eyes that he may see
[36:28] and the Lord opened the eyes of the
[36:31] young man and he saw and behold a
[36:36] mountain was full of
[36:41] what amen God bless you read words you
[36:44] may be
[36:45] seated see sometimes we think we're in
[36:48] the we're in this
[36:50] [Music]
[36:51] alone sometimes we think we we we're
[36:54] just here alone sometimes we think
[37:00] that the battle that we're fighting that
[37:04] we're in the we're in
[37:26] the e
[38:02] be privileged to something that's going
[38:03] to happen and we can know what's going
[38:06] on and it might be you know it might be
[38:10] an an attack against us but a lot of
[38:13] times but it's an unseen Force unseen
[38:19] real sometimes the devil is
[38:22] instigating and the devil is setting a
[38:25] trap for you bless bless and all he
[38:27] wants you to do is react and
[38:30] respond but often times all we got to do
[38:33] is
[38:34] just don't worry about it amen God you
[38:38] got everything under control amen amen
[38:42] but a lot of times we follow up
[38:45] situation because we look to the five
[38:49] senses right so uh the contact our
[38:54] Earthly home we deal with the uh the
[38:57] three dimensions light uh matter and
[39:01] time amen and sometimes because of this
[39:05] body we're
[39:08] trapped it's almost like we're in a
[39:11] prison and you know we doing
[39:15] time and we we're trapped in
[39:19] time but we are Eternal beings we we
[39:24] come from
[39:26] God we were amen meant to be Sons and
[39:30] Daughters of Christ
[39:32] God but because of sin amen we fell from
[39:36] the grace of
[39:37] God but by the grace of God when God is
[39:40] trying to bring us and something inside
[39:43] of us we're groaning
[39:45] for we're groaning because we know we're
[39:48] not in our ought to be
[39:52] conditioned we're not in our right
[39:55] condition this body amen so when we
[39:58] receive the Holy Ghost when we receive
[40:00] the the uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:03] it tells us amen it calls us up a little
[40:07] higher it Lift us up out of the power of
[40:10] Darkness translates us into the kingdom
[40:13] of De son and sometimes is invisible but
[40:16] it's real to us amen we know what God
[40:19] has done in our lives it's an unseen
[40:22] real but we see amen amen because we
[40:26] know the effect of the gospel and the
[40:28] power of the Gospel in our
[40:31] lives we know what Jesus has done for
[40:34] us
[40:36] so as it is in these three dimension
[40:40] then we uh communic there's a
[40:43] communication Dimension amen where you
[40:46] deal with the fourth dimension and
[40:48] you're going into the channel of
[40:50] communication radio television and we
[40:53] call it the the information of the Super
[40:56] Highway
[40:58] sometimes and we got the internet we got
[41:01] uh computers and we got Ai and all of
[41:05] that so we're going into that fourth
[41:09] dimension the scientific Dimension are
[41:12] you with me so uh uh the world of the
[41:16] Unseen things are happening right now in
[41:19] this room amen that you can't
[41:22] see amen Elijah's servant amen thought
[41:26] that amen the the Syrian Army what we
[41:29] going to do and you might have situation
[41:32] that you're dealing with what we going
[41:34] to do and I said Lord amen don't fear
[41:38] open their
[41:40] eyes that you can understand that if God
[41:44] be us yes who can be against us and and
[41:49] they that's with us is more than them
[41:51] that is against us but you need to
[41:54] recognize that God said I'll never leave
[41:56] you I'll never forsake you I'm with you
[42:00] and I'll be with you
[42:02] always there's an innumerable company of
[42:04] angels Jesus said amen no man take my
[42:08] life I lay it down amen and I got power
[42:11] to raise it up again and when they came
[42:13] to get him he said amen don't you worry

[42:18] to call 12 Legion of
[42:20] angels praise God Amen when he was going
[42:23] through his uh time in Gethsemane amen
[42:27] he was being strengthened and
