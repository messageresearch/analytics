[34:28] God forbid.
[34:30] What
[34:31] know ye not
[34:34] &gt;&gt; that which is joined to an hollow is
[34:38] what?
[34:39] &gt;&gt; One body. is one body.
[34:41] For two, says he shall be one flesh.
[34:46] But he that is joined unto what?
[34:50] &gt;&gt; To the Lord is
[34:52] &gt;&gt; one spirit. Flee what?
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Flee fornication. Every sin that a man

[35:34] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Thank you. For ye are what?
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Bought with a price.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; You're bought with a price. Therefore,
[35:40] glorify God in your body and in your
[35:43] what?
[35:45] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Thank God for the
[35:47] word. Um,
[35:50] I thought this morning, you know, I had
[35:52] many things to say, but you're bought
[35:55] with a price.
[35:58] You're bought with a price. of us
[36:00] looking at God in simplicity and we were
[36:03] you know
[36:05] looking at those things but you bought
[36:08] with a price
[36:10] that this gospel that God is is giving
[36:13] us the word that God gives us is in
[36:16] simplicity. It's not something that you
[36:19] know way above us or way beneath us is
[36:23] God hiding himself in simplicity.
[36:27] And and and when you hear things that
[36:30] seem to be so intellectual that only the
[36:34] intelligence can understand it, God
[36:38] amen. He takes the wisdom of the world
[36:41] and he call it foolishness.
[36:44] You know, sometimes we think that we got
[36:46] to be able to speak the Greek and the
[36:48] Hebrew, you know, and we got to be able
[36:51] to understand those terminologies and
[36:54] sometimes we have to understand, you
[36:56] know, the the mysteries in such a
[36:59] complicated way that it's no more
[37:01] simple. But the the God mystery was that
[37:05] uh uh the the mystery of God was Christ
[37:09] coming in a manger. A little baby.
[37:12] A little baby coming down in a manger.
[37:15] God hiding himself in simplicity. Now,
[37:17] who would believe that the the God
[37:19] that's above us, the creator of heaven
[37:21] and earth, could come down and humble
[37:23] himself and come in a little baby? That
[37:27] was a mystery. That was a a great
[37:29] revelation. That was God kind.
[37:33] Amen. Praise God. Changing from Amen.
[37:35] God above us to come with us.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But amen. Now uh somebody says
[37:44] well you know it's so above the
[37:47] intelligent folks that they could not
[37:50] comprehend. Amen. God coming down in
[37:53] such a simple way.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] uh uh the mighty God,
[38:01] the everlasting father and the prince of
[38:03] peace coming down in the form of a
[38:07] little little little baby.
[38:10] He was in the world and the world was
[38:14] made by him.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; God coming in such a simple manner
[38:20] but it was so simple that who would
[38:23] believe such a thing? Amen.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; The spirit God, the creator of heaven
[38:27] and earth, yet came down in in a virgin
[38:31] and come down as a little baby.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Wrapped in swollen clothes, born in a
[38:37] manger.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; But who would believe that? That's the
[38:41] creator. Somebody, amen, that was able
[38:43] to create the universe, the stars and
[38:46] the moon and the sun. Yet he can come
[38:48] down in the form of a little baby. Amen.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Lana, you talk about a deep mystery.
[38:56] You talk about being deep. That is deep.
[39:00] Amen.
[39:02] Because
[39:04] the intelligent mind or the individual
[39:07] would not be able to comprehend that God
[39:10] can that this this one that was standing
[39:14] among them, Jesus was the one that
[39:17] created the heavens and earth. that he
[39:21] was God. Amen.
[39:23] In flesh form. Who would believe that?
[39:27] Uh-uh. The people could not comprehend
[39:32] that God has condescended and come down
[39:35] in the body of human flesh. The Bible
[39:39] says, "In the beginning was the word,
[39:42] and the word was with God, and the word
[39:45] was
[39:46] &gt;&gt; God,
[39:47] &gt;&gt; and the word was made flesh." Amen.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; And dwelt among us.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; God coming down and making himself a
[39:54] body.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; And gets in that body to reconcile the
[39:58] world. So this morning we're talking
[40:00] about bought with a price
[40:04] in first Corinthians here uh
[40:12] as we talk at six 1 Corinthians 6 here
[40:16] bought with the price.
[40:19] It says in the 20 verse
[40:21] for ye are bought with a price
[40:25] therefore glorify.
[40:28] Amen. God in your bodies and in your
[40:32] spirit which is of God.
[40:35] [Music]
[40:36] Let me back up to the 19th verse and
[40:38] read that again. What know ye not that
[40:41] your body is what?
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Temple of the Holy Ghost.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Now in time past when we were not saved
[40:48] and we were in the world and we were you
[40:51] little you know just living any kind of
[40:53] life we wanted to live. But when Christ
[40:56] came into us
[40:59] and he had to remind the church because
[41:01] the church was doing things that were
[41:05] against the body. They were doing things
[41:07] that they shouldn't have been done doing
[41:10] as believers and as Christians folk were
[41:13] doing what they used to do before they
[41:15] got saved.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; So I'm saying he said you're not your
[41:23] own. Now, when it comes down to
[41:25] Christians having a choice, the bornag
[41:29] again believer does not have a choice.
[41:34] Now, you might say, uh, now there's no
[41:37] choice that we have. We
[41:40] the choice has already been made.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We realize that uh we didn't
[41:47] choose him, but he chose us.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and because he chose us, I'm
[41:53] glad he did.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God Amen. I didn't come
[41:58] seeking for God. God sought after me.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; When Adam said he was hiding
[42:04] &gt;&gt; and God said, "Where are you, Adam?"
[42:06] Adam said, "I'm hiding." He said, "Why?"
[42:08] He said, "Because I'm naked."
[42:11] &gt;&gt; See, Adam realized that sin, amen,
[42:15] couldn't come in God's presence no more.
[42:17] So, he hid from God. God went and found
[42:20] Adam.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said, "What you done?"
[42:25] And God is saying to you, "Amen. When we
[42:27] are running from God, what have you
[42:30] done,
[42:32] man?" In his in in in a sinful state,
[42:36] amen, he runs from God.
[42:39] But God seeks you out.
[42:43] The Bible says, "The step of a good man
[42:45] ordered by the Lord."
[42:47] The Bible tells us, amen, God forneew us
[42:50] and and and for knowing us, he
[42:52] predestinated us to be conformed into
[42:55] the image of him. So God, he he comes
[42:58] after us. Doesn't matter where you are.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; No matter how old you are, how young you
[43:05] are, God comes after you.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; He knows how to find you.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he found me when I was
[43:12] young.
[43:14] When I was a teenager trying ripping and
[43:17] running, I didn't want God, but God
[43:20] wanted me.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't want him cuz I I I was
[43:26] too busy with the worldly things. I
[43:29] didn't want him, but he wanted me.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Often you as humans and as fleshly
[43:35] beings, we don't want God. But God,
[43:37] Amen. He seeks out to him you because he
[43:40] knows what you need.
[43:43] He knows that you need him.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; So God knows how to get you
[43:49] &gt;&gt; when you don't want him.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; As I say often times,
[43:58] the Bible says God should supply all of
[44:01] our needs.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen."
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want what we don't need.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; And what we need, we don't want it.
[44:11] Amen.
[44:12] So,
[44:14] and and that seems to be the attitude of
[44:16] man. He's always trying to run away from
[44:19] God, not run to God. Because the Amen.
[44:23] And the the the things of God, this
[44:27] flesh don't we were born in sin,
[44:29] shaping, and iniquity. And we're by
[44:31] nature, Amen. the children of wrath. And
[44:34] we were enemies in our minds. Amen. And
[44:36] that's why God had to come to us to get
[44:39] us. Amen.
[44:42] Because we were covered by a spirit of
[44:46] disobedience.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Our spirit was we disobeyed God. We
[44:51] didn't want God,
[44:53] &gt;&gt; but God knew we needed him.
[44:56] It's something about
[44:59] &gt;&gt; the favor of God being with you
[45:03] &gt;&gt; and he comes. You know, I I I said for a
[45:05] subtopic this morning, I am redeemed.
[45:10] And and it goes back to the the subject
[45:14] this morning, bought with a price.
[45:20] And in uh Acts 2028,
[45:24] Acts 20 and 28,
[45:27] I'm bought with the price.
[45:30] It was a
[45:32] You are valuable.
[45:35] See, somewhat we don't realize how
[45:38] valuable we are to God.
[45:41] To God, you are you you you are
[45:44] valuable. You you mean something. You
[45:47] know, we don't value ourselves. We don't
[45:50] value our life. But God values you.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; He values you so much. He shows and
[45:57] proves to you that I love you and I
[45:59] value you.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes people say nobody cares about
[46:05] me. Nobody, you know, God cares about
[46:08] you.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; He values you.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not by uh something that
[46:15] you will or you wanted. But God wanted
[46:18] you. Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; So God ordain your steps and God have
[46:23] you here or have you under the sound of
[46:25] a voice to show Amen. You said why I
[46:29] sometimes we sometimes we don't even
[46:31] want to listen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God knows that we Amen. He
[46:37] puts us in a in a place that that you
[46:40] hear. Amen. When you don't want to hear.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you you you you're in a
[46:47] family or you have parents or you have
[46:49] individuals that that witness to you
[46:52] that you sometime you want to close up
[46:54] your ears and I don't want to hear it.
[46:57] But God has a way of saying, "Amen.
[47:00] Amen. You belong to me and I'm not going
[47:02] to let you."
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to let you get away
[47:06] because you belong to me.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:11] And you said, "Well," and that's that's
[47:13] the way it is. You you can run, but you
[47:15] can't hide.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; If you belong to God, God got a way of
[47:19] finding you.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; And because he loves you and he cares
[47:23] about you. Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; And Acts 20 and 28, he says here, I'm
[47:30] talking about bought with a price
[47:34] more uh excuse me, he says,
[47:44] Take heed therefore unto who?
[47:48] He talking to the preachers. He says
[47:51] Paul getting ready to go off the scene
[47:53] and he just
[47:56] getting ready to die. And um before he
[48:01] died,
[48:02] he was talking about he had shown to
[48:04] declare the whole all the council of
[48:07] God. And he's talking to the preacher.
[48:10] He's telling them what to do. He said,
[48:12] "Take heed therefore unto yourselves."
[48:16] I'm talking about bought with the price.
[48:19] He said, "Unto yourselves and to all the
[48:22] flock
[48:24] over which the what?"
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost had made you what?
[48:28] Overseer.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; The overseer.
[48:31] Overseer and a bishop and an elder and
[48:34] all of that. One one thing. The Holy
[48:38] Ghost got to make you overseer.
[48:40] Man can make you a bishop. Man can make
[48:42] you overseer. Man can make you a pastor.
[48:45] But God got to do it.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost don't do it, you got
[48:49] man-made religion.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if the Holy Ghost does it,
[48:53] Amen.
[48:55] you didn't have nothing to do with it.
[48:58] Amen. When God comes into you, it's a
[49:01] gift.
[49:02] Amen. The Holy Ghost is the gift of God.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; You didn't pay for it.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; You didn't do nothing. Amen. All you had
[49:11] to do is receive it.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And the Holy Ghost is
[49:15] not a thing. It's a person.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; And when he comes down in you, you're no
[49:23] more your own.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; You're no more your own. And you're
[49:26] bought with a price.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You're no more your
[49:30] own. You don't want to be your own.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Because you look back what you was and
[49:34] what you are now.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; I was a sinner. I was wretched and
[49:38] undone.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; I was no good. I was a liar. I was a
[49:41] thief. I was everything.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But God saved me one day.

[49:49] But God save us one day.

[1:01:28] knocked on the door and tried to tell
[1:01:29] him to come on out to the church and and
[1:01:32] there was children in the house and girl
[1:01:34] told me you get from around here. we
[1:01:36] smoking our crack.
[1:01:39] I said, "Lord,"
[1:01:41] I said, "I better get back
[1:01:44] cuz it might have been smoking. I want
[1:01:46] to get some contact."
[1:01:49] And she said,
[1:01:52] "Get, you know," and she didn't use
[1:01:54] those words. You know how she used those
[1:01:57] nice words.
[1:02:00] And I thought about the children. I
[1:02:02] thought about the children. And I
[1:02:04] thought about, you know, I'm knocking
[1:02:05] doors in here and I'm trying to get the
[1:02:08] people
[1:02:10] into a better life, but you know,
[1:02:13] sometimes we don't want a better.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; We think what we doing is cool. What we
[1:02:18] doing is all right. We don't want
[1:02:21] better. We we we're satisfied. We're
[1:02:23] just
[1:02:25] Oh, God. Can you see this? I can't be
[1:02:28] satisfied with that. Some people just
[1:02:32] adjust to it. They think that this is
[1:02:34] the way it is and it's all right with
[1:02:36] me. But I couldn't adjust to it. I It
[1:02:39] wasn't all right. I could not adopt to
[1:02:42] it. I didn't want to because I didn't
[1:02:45] want that.
[1:02:47] Are you with me?
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; You can make your adjustment. You can
[1:02:51] relax and say it's all right. But I
[1:02:53] couldn't do it.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that God saw me as a
[1:02:58] young person and saved me.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't want to be a preacher,
[1:03:02] but he saved me.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Didn't think I was intelligent enough or
[1:03:07] good enough and and didn't think I was I
[1:03:10] was too I was too afraid to be a
[1:03:12] preacher, but by the grace of God
[1:03:18] against my own will.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God Amen. Amen. Uh did something
[1:03:24] in my life that I just had to testify.
[1:03:27] Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; I had to tell somebody that God saved
[1:03:30] me.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; That he got me out of that pit.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; What I should have been, what I could
[1:03:36] have been.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; But God loved me enough to care about me
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; and to come get me.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I had nothing on
[1:03:46] nobody else.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; I was no good. I was no better than
[1:03:51] them. But thank God for his grace and
[1:03:53] mercy.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:56] It's just a God's grace and mercy on my
[1:03:58] life.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; And I and I thank him. I don't want to
[1:04:02] get up here and cry like a baby, but I
[1:04:04] thank him.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; I thank God for his grace and mercy.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz he came to get me.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:04:15] It means so much to me.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:04:22] I want to tell it. Don't mind
[1:04:23] testifying.
[1:04:25] Amen.
[1:04:28] All my family said, "You were never so
[1:04:31] bad. You was a good boy." But I know how
[1:04:34] rich I was. I don't care what they say.
[1:04:38] Amen. Because they went a little further
[1:04:40] and a little longer than I did. But I
[1:04:43] thank God I was wretched
[1:04:45] to me. I was just as wretch as anybody.
[1:04:48] Might be more cuz I was more sneaky.
[1:04:52] Praise God.
[1:04:54] when I was rich. Let me go back to the
[1:04:57] 28th verse. God, y'all, y'all bear with
[1:05:00] me. Get get me shook up because I
[1:05:03] recognize that I'm bold with the price.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; And and I've been I am redeemed. I I I
[1:05:10] really recognize the value of it.
[1:05:13] Lord have mercy.
[1:05:16] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:05:19] Thank you for loving me.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you for caring.
[1:05:24] Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:28] Means so much to me now.
[1:05:31] Come too far.
[1:05:34] Thank you.
[1:05:36] Never thought I'd live
[1:05:39] to be the age I am.
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:42] Sometimes you don't care if you live or
[1:05:44] die.
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:50] went to join the military and got to the
[1:05:53] last doctor. He said, "You can't come
[1:05:55] in. You're 4F. You got a knee
[1:05:57] operation."
[1:05:59] At that time, I would have went to
[1:06:00] Vietnam.
[1:06:03] That didn't mind going. But God saw
[1:06:05] mercy.
[1:06:10] Didn't even let me get in
[1:06:13] because I probably wouldn't have made it
[1:06:15] back home.
[1:06:17] That's just that. didn't care.
[1:06:21] How many young people don't care this
[1:06:23] morning? How many people taking their
[1:06:25] lives and just really
[1:06:27] they don't even value living? They don't
[1:06:30] care.
[1:06:35] But I'm glad that God gave me something
[1:06:39] to care about,
[1:06:41] a purpose for living.
[1:06:44] Because sometimes we don't understand
[1:06:47] our purpose for living.
[1:06:50] We have no no purpose.
[1:06:53] When you don't have purpose, you might
[1:06:55] do anything
[1:06:57] because you don't have purpose.
[1:07:01] You don't know how valuable your life is
[1:07:04] or how valuable you are,
[1:07:09] but you you're very much valuable to
[1:07:13] God. Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; He He saw how valuable you were to him.
[1:07:21] He cared so much about you
[1:07:24] and loved you so he said God so loved
[1:07:28] the world
[1:07:30] that he gave his only begotten son.
[1:07:37] Okay.
[1:07:39] Take heed to the flock there. Take heed
[1:07:42] therefore unto the unto yourselves
[1:07:46] and to all the flock over to which the
[1:07:47] Holy Ghost has made you overseer to feed
[1:07:50] the church of God which he has
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; which he is what
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; I said you bought with what?
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Which he has purchased with what?
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Now God God is a spirit right?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; We all we with that.
[1:08:10] But he said the church of God, the
[1:08:12] church belong to who?
[1:08:15] It it don't belong to the Baptist, the
[1:08:16] Methodists, the Pentecost, the
[1:08:18] apostolic. The church belong to who?
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; God. And he purchased it what?
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; With his own blood. Are you with me?
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; The valuable. You're so valuable that
[1:08:31] God purchased you with his own blood.
[1:08:33] Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Anytime a bishop, a preacher, a church,
[1:08:36] a group,
[1:08:38] sometime the church think they they save
[1:08:41] you cuz they say come and join the
[1:08:44] church. You can join the church, you can
[1:08:46] join the lodge, but you can't join
[1:08:50] God's church. You got to be born in it.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Except a man be born again,
[1:08:57] he cannot enter the kingdom of God." Are
[1:08:59] you with me? How did I be born? He said,
[1:09:02] "You must be born of water and the
[1:09:04] spirit." Are you with me?
[1:09:07] You must repent of your sin, be baptized
[1:09:09] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:09:11] remission of your sin, and the promise
[1:09:13] is you shall receive the gift of the
[1:09:15] Holy Ghost.
[1:09:17] Okay.
[1:09:18] So, by the grace of God, I I got to get
[1:09:21] to my last part for I ought to stop
[1:09:24] here, but I'm going to try to get to the
[1:09:26] last part. First Peter 1 and 18.
[1:09:33] First Peter 1.
[1:09:44] I I am redeemed.
[1:09:47] To redeem means to be bought back.
[1:09:53] It's like putting something in the pawn
[1:09:54] shop and you're coming back and you're
[1:09:56] getting it back out.
[1:09:59] Amen. What you put in, you get out.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] We were sold to sin and we needed to be
[1:10:07] redeemed. We need to be bought back to
[1:10:09] God.
[1:10:11] We lost fellowship with God. We couldn't
[1:10:13] get to God, but God came and got He came
[1:10:16] to us. We couldn't get to him.
[1:10:19] He put angels to block the way to the
[1:10:21] tree of life. Cherobims, you couldn't
[1:10:24] get back to God. You were blocked. If
[1:10:27] you can get back to God, you can eat of
[1:10:29] the tree of life and live forever.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; But because we couldn't get to God, God
[1:10:35] came to us.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; And because you and your sins can't get
[1:10:39] to God, God comes to the center.
[1:10:43] Are you with me? And he makes a way an
[1:10:46] at torment. He makes a
[1:10:50] a a sacrifice.
[1:10:53] He says here in the of 18th verse he
[1:10:56] says 1 Peter uh 1:18 for as much as ye
[1:11:00] know that ye were redeemed
[1:11:04] that you're not redeemed with
[1:11:06] corruptible things as what?
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Silver and gold.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; That's where people are caught up with
[1:11:11] silver and gold. Come to church, they
[1:11:13] taking up all that money. Give more.
[1:11:15] Give more. You get blessed. Give more.
[1:11:17] Get blessed. Oh man. Come on.
[1:11:20] You know, I think about
[1:11:22] when I was a little boy going up to what
[1:11:25] they call the block and looking at, you
[1:11:28] know, those guys that call yourself
[1:11:30] pimps and hustlers and all, you know,
[1:11:35] and I looked at them how they do, you
[1:11:38] know, and saying how they do, the young
[1:11:39] ladies and all. And I look at some of
[1:11:42] the preachers in the pull pit and remind
[1:11:43] me of those guys. Those guys are smooth
[1:11:45] talkers.
[1:11:49] Smooth talkers.
[1:11:52] I often time tell about
[1:11:55] fella pull my little group over to the
[1:11:57] side, open up a little briefcase
[1:12:03] and it was full of big bills.
[1:12:07] He said to us, he said to me, you know,
[1:12:12] you dropped this off.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; I gave you a package to drop off. In
[1:12:18] other words, this is yours. Drop the
[1:12:20] package off.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Some of my friends looked
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; and they stared at all those all that
[1:12:28] money
[1:12:32] and I told them,
[1:12:34] "Come on here. Get yourself on, man. We
[1:12:37] ain't going for that.
[1:12:42] I think one of the fellas with me, he
[1:12:43] became one of a big time drug dealer
[1:12:47] later in life. But at that time, I says,
[1:12:50] "Come on."
[1:12:53] Wouldn't because I didn't I didn't play
[1:12:55] that.
[1:12:58] And I'm saying, you'll be tempted plenty
[1:13:00] of times.
[1:13:03] silver and gold,
[1:13:05] money. What we wouldn't redeem was
[1:13:09] things as silver and gold. Are you with
[1:13:12] me?
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; If you want the things of this world,
[1:13:15] silver and gold, and that those things
[1:13:17] mean something. You know, a lot of
[1:13:19] people, they take the gospel and they
[1:13:21] sell it.
[1:13:23] They get in the pull pit and they sell
[1:13:26] they make merchandise of the
[1:13:28] congregation, make merchandise of the
[1:13:29] people.
[1:13:31] And a lot of people get in the mind that
[1:13:34] what they give
[1:13:36] they giving to the church or giving to
[1:13:37] the preacher. But what you give you give
[1:13:39] to God.
[1:13:41] If you're giving it and you give it with
[1:13:43] a cheerful heart and you don't expect
[1:13:45] nothing in return because God blesses
[1:13:48] the what?
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Cheer forgiver. Yeah. But people believe
[1:13:53] that because of what they give that they
[1:13:55] gonna get special treatment.
[1:13:58] Amen. God don't care if you don't give
[1:14:00] but a penny. Are you with me?
[1:14:04] God going to bless you. Amen.
[1:14:08] Because he knows you gave what you
[1:14:10] could.
[1:14:12] Are you with me? But oh, I ain't getting
[1:14:15] on to that. But you wasn't redeemed with
[1:14:18] corruptible things as silver and gold.
[1:14:20] Okay.
[1:14:23] From your vain conversation lifestyle
[1:14:26] received by the the tradition from your
[1:14:30] fathers,
[1:14:32] but with the what?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:14:38] it's the precious blood. You know, I I I
[1:14:41] when I was looking at that, I said it's
[1:14:43] precious.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; The blood's so precious that it could
[1:14:48] redeem us. It could buy us back.
[1:14:53] Only the blood of God can do that.
[1:14:56] Because every man that was born of a
[1:14:58] woman was born in sin. But Jesus was not
[1:15:01] born in sin. Amen. He was born of a
[1:15:05] virgin. Not by sex act.
[1:15:10] But God created egg and sperm. And Jesus
[1:15:13] was born of a virgin.
[1:15:16] Are you with me?
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:21] The precious blood of Christ as of a
[1:15:24] lamb without blemish and without what?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Who verily was what?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; For ordained before the foundation of
[1:15:32] the world, but was manifested in these
[1:15:35] last times. What?
[1:15:37] for you
[1:15:41] whom by him do believe in God that
[1:15:45] raised him from the dead and gave him
[1:15:49] glory that your faith and hope might be
[1:15:52] where?
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; In God.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; In God.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; I got to stop.
[1:15:58] His blood is precious. His blood is
[1:16:00] valuable.
[1:16:02] You have been redeemed.
[1:16:06] your your sins have been paid for.
[1:16:12] You live a life
[1:16:16] once you have been born again. And once
[1:16:19] you have been redeemed, because you have
[1:16:22] been born again, you've been washed in
[1:16:25] the blood of the lamb,
[1:16:28] you don't make choices no more. When
[1:16:32] you're born again, you become a new
