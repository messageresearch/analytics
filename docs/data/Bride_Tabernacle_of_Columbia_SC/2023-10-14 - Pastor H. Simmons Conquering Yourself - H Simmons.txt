is good amen the Book of James just the fourth chapter and six verse James just feel led in the midst of the water that taking place over in Israel we know that Israel is our time pieace and we know that when the Gentile days are finished God will return back to the Jews and we're close to that time says James uh 4 and six but he giveth more grace wherefore he said God resisteth the what proud proud and giveth grace to the what submit yourselves therefore to God resist what and he will what is that right Draw N to God and he would what clean your hands ye Sinners and puf ify your heart you double minded be afflicted and moan weak let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy in the heaven is humble what in the sight of the Lord and He what God bless the read of his word you may be seated if you want God to lift you up we we come to places in our lives that as we said many times our greatest enemy is our ourselves right and um because we seem to sometimes deceive ourselves then we begin to lose the victory we must conquer ourselves let me just ve off to he saying that I said on Tuesday night uh we had quite a number here Tuesday night and I said on last night in Mullins you know where the church ought to be packed and people on the knees crying out because you know one of the national people got on the uh television on the Internet or whatever and says we're at the end of the world and it looks like it if it's ever been a time it looks like we're at the end of the world that the chaos that is taking place in Ukraine and then over in Israel Israel is the time piece now if God began to deal with Israel deal with the Jews we talking about the Great Tribulation period Then There was talking about two prophets coming on the scene Moses and Elijah in Revelation 11th chapter right and if they come on the scene and you'll still here that means one thing you missed the Rapture and the Bible say says there'll be 10 virgin five wise and five what foolish the difference between the wise and the foolish the wise had what they had the Holy Ghost the others thought they they had enough or they had some o but not enough are you with me they all what ran out are you with me the tribulation period is right here before for us the world can't stand too much more the earthquakes and all the stuff that's happening the world this Earth can't stand too much more it's in its birth pains so let me just pause for from conquering yourself because it's time that if you're not concerned about your own Eternal Destiny then who's going to be concerned about I thought about my life and I said you know every up down and all my mistakes and all my failures I said God was always there even when I fail I did some crazy stuff in life and some stuff that I don't never even mention you you you you do you do some crazy stuff but even in your craziness your foolishness God still protected you amen amen still with you are you with me but I'm glad that when God saved me he saved me I didn't have to worry about all the crazy stuff no more because I trusted him brother and sister I'm saying you got to trust God if you trust God and you know that your life is in his hand my life is in your hand I got to trust you with everything thing I got to trust you with my life I can't trust myself because I'm a failure so I got to trust God Amen and conquering yourself you got to humble yourself amen and let God what lift you up but we're so uh so much concerned about ourselves to ourselves amen we we actually defeat ourselves by trying amen to uh help ourselves David said I will lift my eyes to the heels from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord amen Lord the Lord the Lord is my helper amen I I got to trust him to help me I can't help myself but God is my helper that's why David said the Lord is my light in my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life amen I'm dependent on God what about you amen amen I I I oh my life is in his hand amen but you got to realize amen that you are defeated you the devil will amen uh oh destroy you praise God you don't have enough strength to battle the demon forces amen that's out there in the world and you have an aary the adversary the devil as a roaring lion he goes to and fr seeking whom he may devour the devil wants to devour you amen but it's the grace of God that keeps you amen God's grace upon your life God's mercy every time I hear about somebody just had an accident brother Jim's brother he had an accident and was in the hospital for about a week and he died I said what's keeping uh you from just walking out here getting in the car driving down the road and yet somebody just come and hit you or whatever brother was telling me a deer jumped on his car that deer could have took him out are you with me anything could happen any time that could take you out I thought about it when he said that I said that could have been his life it messed up his nice car which was almost paid for but but he he was all right but that same accident could have been that that deer amen that almost to probably total lost his car could have total lost his life but that was God's grace is't that right so I'm saying to you Amen to conquer yourself is to save yourself now in Acts uh uh two acts two please galeb way up there now acts two ear as you right there you can got to pull up Acts 2 and the Bible says acts 238 acts 238 it says then Peter said unto them what repent the problem is we're talking about conquering yourself then you see what happened the Jews had taken and by Wicked hand They Crucified and they killed the Lord are you with me now the Jews over there they looking for the Messiah to come but he's already come but they didn't know it the Bible tells us in Romans 9 blindness in part on Romans 11 blindness in part as it happened to Israel and to the fullness of the Gentiles Romans 11 see it's a time appointed that God says amen Gentile Days Are Over amen I'm moving on to the Jews amen so the Jews were recognized as Joseph Brothers amen persecuted Joseph right and Joseph was a type of Christ isn't that right so when Joseph set at the right hand of pharaoh amen and Jesus set at the right hand of God isn't that right but his his brothers amen the Bible say Jesus came to his own in his own what s right so the Jews amen was blinded for to to let us in God blinded them amen so we we we we in the position that we in amen that God's one day is going to uh uh let Joseph Brothers recognize who he is amen God Amen blinded your eyes but one day Joseph going to tell his brothers hey I'm Joseph and one day they're going to look at the hands of him them whom they pierc are you with me and they're going to recognize Jesus as Messiah are you with me amen he's oh God but the Jews until this day they're fighting to hold on to Jerusalem because everywhere they went throughout the world Amen they they they have been persecuted so in 1948 Ezekiel 37 said Can these bones live amen 37 amen and he said Lord God thou knowest he said prophesy to the bones and say oh you you dry bones hear the word of the Lord amen are you with me and the bones began to come together are you with me so Israel which was dead and just dried up and looked like there was hopeless but God said Israel was going to return to be a nation be born in one day are you with me and in 1948 they they flew the flag and the United Nation recogniz it but in 46 the prophet brother brandham said God recognized Israel had come back in 46 and God gave him a Ministry of healing Divine Healing to go to the world Amen as a gift of God to get the Gentile bride ready for the Rapture are you with me but the gift of healing was only to amen cast the attention of people are you with me amen so God in this last day has given us a message to the Gentile Church to get a bride ready for Rapture are you with me why everybody else going to church and doesn't don't know what's happening you as the elect of God not just as the church go but as the elect of God Amen as amen that God chose you and him before the foundation of the world so God said he spoke to the rest of them in Parables but it's given un you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom amen are you so God Amen as you being elect of God is nothing that you've done because you were a part of God before the foundation of the world just like you were a part of your great great granddaddy you were a part of God are you with me and God saw you coming before you got here God saw you coming and God knew the one day you would hear the truth of the word and you would recognize Jesus Christ died for your sins am are you with me and when you recognize there something that that was German in in your heart it was it it would Quicken your spirit and the power of God would take over amen and something will illuminate you and you said I know Jesus is my Lord I know he died for my sin and conviction set in if conviction never sets in if you say well I accept you as my savior no conviction but when you when it's real when it's real you humble yourself real power is to humble yourself real power you want amen real powers to be able to be humble enough to say Lord you died for my sin Lord I'm a sinner I'm no good I'm rich and I'm undone I need you Lord am I'm born in sin shaper in iniquity come to the world speaking lies I need God I need help save me Lord Save Me Lord deliver me God help me I need help but if we don't see ourselves as Sinners amen all we want to do see ourselves as Church person and joining some church and going with some organized religion you know the Catholic church was a mother of organized religion and every organized uh uh religion is the daughters of the mother holl Revelation 17 are you with me and God says come out of her my people come out of mystery babon are you with me what do he want you to come out for to come out of her to come back to the Bible are you with me come back to the word of God the Bible is right we're not trying to introduce a person to some church some Creed or some Dogma or men some organization but to Jesus Christ he's the word the Bible said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God are you with me the Bible said he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not the world still don't know him people go to church and they don't know him are you with me amen he told Phillip those amen philli said Lord show us the father and we'll be satisfied am he said have you not been so long time with me yet you've not known me you don't understand who I am he said he that has seen me has seen the father how say thou then show us the father you don't know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you are you with me praise God Jesus Christ was God the spirit overshot and Mary amen coming in her creating a and sperm amen a body amen and then Jesus Christ the body was called the Son of God the Holy Ghost amen was the father amen are y'all with me the Holy Ghost was the father amen and God created himself above body amen called Jesus which was the son of God because amen God made himself a body to get in the Bible said the wi that God was in Christ to reconcile the world to himself are you with me when there was nobody in heaven nobody in Earth nobody amen able to take the book or look their on Amen but God himself amen as the Lamb of God the lion of the tribe of Judah prevailed to take the book amen I'm glad that he took the book because it was the book of redemption amen but he said I looked and I saw the lion prevailed to take the book and said to me weep not amen amen but the lion what oh but he I saw as the lamb was a slain before the foundation of the world isn't that right somebody the blood was shedding that God can redeem us back to God that Jesus Christ Christ could redeem us back to God so God made a body that could die that could take our place amen and innocent lamb the Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world okay y'all got me I'm back to acts am I there I'm going too fast I'm too excited they excited over there fighting I'm excited here I'm fighting Devils I'm I trust you you you'll be serious about God if you're not serious about God the devil going to get you look at somebody said the devil going to get you if you're not Ser you don't want the devil to get you do you my mama told me that one time ever since that time I never forgotten I went that bed that night and the devil got me I I lifted up my eyes and I was in hell and what I saw down there I saw those long fingernails and those women they was painted faces and had those eyebrows and I said oh Lord and they was saying and I was saying me and my brother us 15 of us I'm we in the bed and I'm pinching here and you all hear him said he said I wasn't going to wake up cuz I know something had happened to you the devil had got a hold of me I I said I could ever remember that time and God let me out of that place I never want to go back to that place no more are you with me I don't know if you ever had something like that happen but I never wanted to go back there I was a little boy but I never wanted to go back are you with me I'mma tell you if you end up in that place some folks have already ended up there cuz they look just like those women I saw when I was down I wonder why I ain't seen no men I don't know the prophet of God said he went to hell and when he went he was dying and and when he was dying he asked God if he let him come back that he'll serve him and the Lord spared his life and he dried the same place I dried just like I dried and I was driving it before I ever knew that God sent a prophet and I was preaching it and telling people I've been to that place and people say you ain't never been there I said yeah I've been and the prophet said he was there and then he said one day he was in J penis and he was coming down the escalator and as he was coming down there he said he thought he was there again because just like it looked in hell he saw those women with that green stuff and stuff around their eyes and they were coming out and he thought he was in a vision cuz he saw visions and he thought hey am I in a vision oh he was trying to no it was reality and that's what it shows you the people the stuff they doing tattooing themselves and putting all kind of things in their nose in their air and piercing themselves and they walking around and you know my cousin say in Philadelphia they got a place where the zombies are they give them drugs and he said it look just like Caleb you said you was up there the other week that people look like zombies you know what I'm saying people look just like The Walking Dead they call it don't y'all ever let y'all children do Pokemon and all these uh demon demon demon stuff are y'all with me don't y'all better watch McDonald's y'all might be eating a devil Burger all these little toys they give you y'all got to watch that stuff are y'all with me the the people are actually these little cartoons that they casting real spells and they're teaching you how to say satanic things are you with me so you got to watch what you digesting in your spirit man are you with me I'm not not I know I'm not on the family thing tonight but it just something to let you know that you got to be careful what you play with put it in your pocketbook oh I got a little toy poke man yeah you next thing you know people be playing around with Seance those little what do you call those cards that get in college and everybody where you some of y'all know y'all already got him in high school what you call them say it one more time y'all want to say y'all was quiet they said it loudly last time and you know what real spirits my one of my neighbors she was a witch and she said she told me the Lord saved her and she she became a witch in college and she said you know she know how to cast spells and do all of that kind of stuff and she said God saved her out of Witchcraft and she said started off with the little tarot cards and all that kind of stuff and actually summoned up demons and all that and and and those demons really did could do damage and she was so glad but she was it she lived in a state almost like her life would never be the same she almost somewhat I think her husband was scared of her and and she was getting ready to mooved to California and I as I was praying to them with them I said I see big ships as I was praying I said and I see water and big ships and as I was praying I thought was telling them what I was looking at and they it m and they said my wife I think you was with me my wife was with me I said I see big ships she she said that's right we're getting ready to move to San Diego I mean San Francisco I said yeah y'all going out there and you already coming out of Witchcraft and and coming to God and giving your life to God but I said don't go out there don't go out there because they're in heavy demonic power out there so she didn't go least I they moved a while back but by the grace of God I'm saying you can get yourself involved in things that's going to be with you the rest of your life though you come and Escape those things those things still going to be in your spirit and they're going to put as my old Bishop used to say he said the scars are still going to be there amen the wound could be healed but the scar is still there are you with me so some of the stuff you do the wound can be healed but the scar still be there That Old Devil he's going to come at you amen but the Bible said resist the devil and he'll what he'll flee from you isn't that right okay then Peter said and then repent you got to repent you got it back and be baptized every one of you in what name of the father Son and Holy Ghost huh tell me who who had the keys to the to the king who did Jesus give the keys to I ask all y'all y'all see how I'm pointing there Mary you don't know Mary sleeping Leah who had the keys Jesus gave the keys to the church said Upon This Rock I build my church G to here who he get the keys to huh Peter okay Peter got the keys did Peter have a wife the Catholic Church said Peter was the first pole but Peter mother-in-law was sick and Jesus healed his mother-in-law right so Peter had a wife ain't that right how you can you have a mother-in-law and not have a wife huh so you had to have a he had a wife amen Peter wife mother was sick ain't that right and Jesus healed her right so what's going on you got millions of people uh are believing in Catholicism that said Peter was the first pope and that's the biggest Li ever been told ain't that right but people believe the lie don't they oh Lord the Bible said there's one mediator between God and man that's a man Christ Jesus isn't that right and they got praying the Mary praying the statutes are you with me y'all see what's happening and then we talking about we let us all come together and be one you think I'm going to be one with them are you no the B the Bible tells us by one Spirit are we baptized into what one body one body are you with me y'all got to realize it's late it's so late and if this wall break out like I'm G tell you something they riding all over the place and they're against Israel going in and I'm going tell y'all something if y'all y'all might wake up too late y'all might get serious about God when it's all over when when when America is getting bombed up like over there the prophet of God he said that Russia would bomb America he saw it in a vision we're close to that time because America went away from God just like Israel did in Nebuchadnezzar came are you with me but who believed our report who believed that Nebuchadnezzar was going to come in and Babylon was going to come in a gentile nation and going to take over are you with me I'm saying we're at the end but do you believe it y'all ready to go home we at the we at the end y'all come to normal Church and not knowing you're at the end and you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet sat around like I'm gonna give you the Holy Ghost come on look at somebody tell them I can't give you the Holy Ghost you got only one person can get the Holy Ghost from me is that who Jesus said I'll s send you another what confidence isn't that right now who's going to give it to you Jesus it doesn't matter what church you go to it no matter who your preacher is it don't matter who you say you are God Jesus Christ going to give you the Holy Ghost he'll send the confidence are you with me he said I'm with you but I shall be where in you conquering yourself how how can you conquer yourself I got to receive the Holy Ghost I got to humble myself and said Lord I need the Holy Ghost I I if I get the Holy Ghost we we're more the conquerors to him than what love us amen because God love us amen then let the love of God come down in your heart God I need your love to come down conquer me I don't want me in the way way amen of going to heaven I want to go to heaven Lord amen oh I can't say that word but get all of this out of me amen praise God that's why Paul said I Die daily amen God want to get all of that stuff out of you that ain't right the Bible said mortify your members which are upon the Earth amen Paul said I Die daily let me let me die to myself amen that I can rise with him amen I want to go back with him when he come amen praise God I want to go back with him praise God if you want to go back to Heaven oh Lord praise God you had to come from heaven and ought to go back there he said no man ascended up in heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven are you with me so amen if you want to go there you had to be the how were you there you were thought in the mind of God just like you were a jean in your granddaddy you were a jean seed you were thought in the mind of God God was thinking about you amen and he thought about you he knew your name and he put your name on the lamb Book of Life slain before the foundation of the world your name was written there how do you know because when you hear the word you'll fly to it praise God you'll hear the word and you'll be able to say yes Lord something inside of you say I believe amen something Quicken you something move you
