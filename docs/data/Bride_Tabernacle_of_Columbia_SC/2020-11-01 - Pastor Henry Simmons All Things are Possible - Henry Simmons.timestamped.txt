[30:35] bought unto thee my son which had
[30:39] a dumb spirit
[30:42] and whatsoever he taketh him
[30:46] he teared him
[30:49] and he form it and gnashes with his
[30:52] teeth
[30:54] and pined it away
[30:56] and i speak
[30:58] to thy disciples that they should
[31:02] cast him out and they could not
[31:06] and
[31:07] he answered him
[31:09] said oh faithfulness
[31:12] generation how long shall i be with you
[31:15] how long shall i suffer you
[31:18] bring him unto me
[31:21] and they bought him unto him
[31:24] and when he saw him straightway the
[31:27] spirit tareth him
[31:30] and he fell on the ground
[31:34] and wallet informing
[31:37] he asked his father
[31:40] how long is it all
[31:43] ago
[31:43] [Music]
[31:45] since this came unto him
[31:48] and he said of a child
[31:52] then
[31:53] and of times it
[31:55] has cast him into the fire
[31:59] and into the water to destroy him
[32:02] but if thou can do anything
[32:07] have compassion on us
[32:09] and
[32:11] help us
[32:14] jesus said unto him
[32:17] if thou can believe
[32:21] all things are possible to him that
[32:25] believe it
[32:27] may god bless you towards you may be
[32:28] seated

[32:44] brother and sister when we get desperate
[32:47] enough
[32:49] jesus will come on the scene
[32:54] i said this man was not satisfied with
[32:57] his results
[33:02] just prayer wasn't
[33:05] enough for though the disciples were
[33:09] had their ministry and
[33:11] but this man would not give up
[33:14] on his son
[33:18] the disciples said he may have done all
[33:21] they could do
[33:26] and uh seemed like there was a little
[33:28] doubt
[33:29] in the man's confidence he said
[33:32] if you can do anything
[33:37] i want to talk to you this morning about
[33:41] all things are possible
[33:46] all things are possible
[33:52] and with the little team the devil is
[33:56] defeated

[34:38] for the man they met came to jesus but
[34:42] he doubted the ability of god
[34:45] sometimes we
[34:47] question god's ability
[34:51] we
[34:52] are not certain that god can do it
[34:57] and we ask the question god if you can
[35:00] help me

[1:07:29] a god good amen
[1:07:36] it said here
[1:07:37] 17 1-17 revelation
[1:07:40] and when he saw him
[1:07:43] he fell at his feet as dead
[1:07:45] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:07:48] saying unto me
[1:07:50] fear not for i am the first and the last
[1:07:53] and i said don't don't be scared
[1:07:57] fear not
[1:07:59] don't fear when the devil
[1:08:01] show his ugly head and try to give you
[1:08:04] this and that don't fear
[1:08:07] don't get
[1:08:08] all excited and despondent and
[1:08:11] all the perplexed don't fear
[1:08:16] because jesus said
[1:08:18] don't fear because
[1:08:20] i'm here
[1:08:22] there's no need to fear when i'm here
[1:08:26] are you with me
[1:08:30] the thing that the devil feeds on
[1:08:33] you try to make you afraid
[1:08:36] are you with me
[1:08:38] if you're trying to
[1:08:40] hold on to something that you're afraid
[1:08:42] to lose
[1:08:44] amen but if you know
[1:08:49] reverend say you can't lose with the
[1:08:51] stuff i use
[1:08:58] well reverend i got it wrong
[1:09:01] because a lot of folks lost
[1:09:06] with the stuff they use
[1:09:09] i was in the hospital
[1:09:11] working in the hospital and sometimes i
[1:09:13] look under the mattress
[1:09:14] changing the bed
[1:09:16] and the forehead all river like this and
[1:09:18] that
[1:09:19] and next thing i know they did
[1:09:25] i said all that rubber night up under
[1:09:27] there all kind of thing with reverend
[1:09:29] nike on that and the folk die
[1:09:33] are you with me
[1:09:35] but one thing about this word
[1:09:38] praise god the devil can't kill you
[1:09:41] why
[1:09:43] amen because the stain of death is sin
[1:09:46] and the strength of sin is the law and
[1:09:48] what happened the wages of the sin is
[1:09:50] death but god has given you eternal life
[1:09:53] but the gift of god is what
[1:09:55] so you got eternal life how you gonna
[1:09:57] lose
[1:09:59] isn't that right
[1:10:00] ain't no way the devil can take you out
[1:10:03] the only thing the devil can do give you
[1:10:04] a punch and put you to sleep and you say
[1:10:06] oh thank you amen
[1:10:08] i go to sleep i'm resting for a little
[1:10:10] while amen but when the rapture come
[1:10:12] over wake up
[1:10:15] praise god when he alarm and then lord
[1:10:17] come back up coming back with him
[1:10:21] oh you wouldn't be so why shall i be
[1:10:23] afraid i can't oh last your enemy why
[1:10:27] are you sure you'll be afraid of the
[1:10:28] enemy
[1:10:29] the bible says the last enemy that shall
[1:10:31] be destroyed is death isn't that right
[1:10:34] praise god but death has already been
[1:10:36] destroyed
[1:10:37] the bible said he's abolished there
[1:10:39] and brought life and immortality to the
[1:10:42] light through the gospel
[1:10:44] are you with me isn't that right
[1:10:46] so the devil is already lost
[1:10:51] said to john fear not
[1:10:53] don't be afraid
[1:10:55] and no you say not to me
[1:10:57] afraid of
[1:10:58] the devil can do no more than god allows
[1:11:01] isn't that right
[1:11:03] praise god so why should we be scared of
[1:11:05] anything
[1:11:07] hold to god's unchanging hand
[1:11:10] don't be afraid of the devil bluff
[1:11:14] amen the only thing he can do is i said
[1:11:16] it to brother terry the only thing death
[1:11:19] can do that does gain to live is christ
[1:11:22] so what can the devil do to a real
[1:11:24] believer nothing here got nothing
[1:11:27] he lose either way he lost
[1:11:31] are you with me
[1:11:32] he can't win
[1:11:35] oh lord
[1:11:36] because you're winnings
[1:11:39] you that believe are winners
[1:11:42] are you with me
[1:11:44] the devil is
[1:11:46] defeated
[1:11:49] i gotta calm down and gotta close
[1:11:52] but the devil is defeated
[1:11:55] will you let it sink in
[1:11:58] that he is defeated
[1:12:01] that you should not be afraid
[1:12:04] of any terror by
[1:12:06] day terrible by night or whatever
[1:12:12] in the arrows
[1:12:15] you got you don't have to be afraid of
[1:12:17] nothing
[1:12:19] amen
[1:12:21] because god already have everything
[1:12:24] under control
[1:12:27] bless the lord
[1:12:29] i want to see
[1:12:30] the hand of god
[1:12:33] in a mighty way
[1:12:35] moving through the atmosphere
[1:12:38] supernatural waves of the power of god
[1:12:42] healing where you
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:45] what's been holding you back from your
[1:12:47] healing from your victory
[1:12:49] praise god is not realizing that
[1:12:53] the devil is certainly
[1:12:55] defeated you
[1:12:57] have won
[1:13:00] praise god your sins have been forgiven
[1:13:04] and everything that sin bought
[1:13:07] sickness diseases death sorrow and pain
[1:13:11] the devil is defeated
[1:13:14] the devil is
[1:13:16] washed up
[1:13:18] he can't have control over your life
[1:13:21] brother and sister
[1:13:23] god has given you eternal life
[1:13:25] don't you sell out on god for some
[1:13:28] monster of meat like esau
[1:13:31] god has given you eternal life
[1:13:33] eternal life means more than anything
[1:13:36] that this world has to offer
[1:13:38] are you with me
[1:13:40] oh god
[1:13:42] let me read the next verse and then i
[1:13:43] close
[1:13:45] he said
[1:13:46] i'm he that liveth and was dead and
[1:13:48] behold i'm alive forevermore amen and
[1:13:52] have the keys of hell
[1:13:54] and death

[1:14:10] and jesus said i got the keys of hell
[1:14:11] and death
[1:14:14] you
[1:14:15] peter got the keys of the kingdom when
[1:14:17] he said repent
[1:14:19] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:14:20] of jesus christ for the remission of sin
[1:14:23] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:14:27] if you want to get in the kingdom
[1:14:29] you got to hear what peter said and obey
[1:14:31] all you up
[1:14:34] so you don't have to be afraid because

[1:22:52] you know with using it
[1:22:54] and just clapping my hands or
[1:22:58] i i mean a lot of times i don't know
[1:23:02] i use the fan to
[1:23:04] kind of clap my hands because when i put
[1:23:07] my hands together or whatnot the nerves
[1:23:10] in my um left hand would tingle and hurt
[1:23:14] so bad
[1:23:16] the pain was just so excruciating to um
