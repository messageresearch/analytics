lord bless your word this morning give us strength give us grace in jesus name we pray amen [Music] proverbs 3 1 through 8 i'll read the first you read the next we read the eighth verse together my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandments too let not mercy and truth for safety bind them about thy neck and write them upon the tables of the unharmed for trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to their own understanding six be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil together and it shall be held to thy name and marrow to thy bones may god bless you toward you may be seated praise god if you ever needed to trust the lord the hour is now praise god trust the lord and leading not to thy own understanding amen god's servant spoke a message on lean not that i want understanding and today we want to talk to you concerning direction we need direction [Music] we need guidance direction when we speak of direction what are you really saying instructions on how to get someplace we need instructions of how to get some place how to do something most the things you order now they come in a box and they give you direction how to put your table together how to put this together so you have to put it together but you need directions sometimes it has 50 75 parts you know it looks pretty on the picture but when they send it to you in the box [Music] it's all in pieces praise god and we need direction sometimes uh our lives look like it's all in pieces it's like a puzzle we got to put it together and sometimes we're left with some folks have no directions sometimes we're put on a path and sometimes nobody really puts us on a path sometimes parents just have children they just have them and they don't put them on a pathway they just whatever or life dictates they just go with the wind go with the flow [Music] but their other says well i want my child to be a tennis player i want my child to be a football player i want my child to be a golf i want to tiger woods i want to serena williams i'm on a lebron james and they'll put them on that path [Music] and the child has nothing to do with it they just on that path and ah sometimes they're usually very successful on that path and sometimes folks are put on a course and pointed in a direction that they don't want to go and they find out when by the time they they're struggling they're battling and parents sometimes push them and and then they tall with them because they're trying to point them in a direction that they just don't want to go are you with me and a lot of times in those directions that we push and pump ah them push them when they get there they just sometimes they get to the pinnacle of whatever you wanted them to be and they find out this is not what i wanted to be this is what mama wanted me to be this is what daddy wanted me to be and i don't want to be there and sometimes it's later on in life when we spend all our effort all our time and money and everything the point one in a direction that they don't feel led to go in life is like that we can make some investments that we make and those investments that we invest in and the time that we invest in certain things we wish sometimes that we could take back our investment because it did not draw any dividend matter of fact it was a waste of time so sometimes we invest and we uh point in directions now it's another thing about directions it's the point to watch something you know it's the point towards something and i'm gonna tell you the quicker now how do i find what direction uh my life is to go in how do i find it because i i believe it some folks are 50 60 years old and their lives are like going with the wind they're tossed to and fro they haven't found themselves so how can they direct their children are you with me have become grandparents and they don't know where they know and they just go with the flow whatever life you know but it's good to have somebody that's anchored it's good to have somebody to help that's deep rooted that the winds when they blow they cannot toss you away from amen because you know amen what you're in the earth for sometimes that is a natural cause and also there's a spiritual cause we start in grammar school oftentimes said rachel knew that she wanted to be a teacher as far as i can remember almost three four years old she wanted to be a teacher that's all i mean that was her goal and then she had a cousin that was going through some things and one time she says i wanted to work with the deaf and the dumb and and then she i said well rachel you know why don't you just try special education because there are more colleges often than that and there's only a few often and so i said why don't you do that and then you can gravitate over there if you wanted but you it's still in the teaching profession and so by the grace of god sometimes there are others that what you want to be caleb made up in mind i think one of the working with the orchestra one of the teachers on the officer said why don't you go in the map son and he says oh sound good to me and so he went to man they wrote joshua from a lot of different colleges and all of a sudden usc wrote him come to business dollar more school of business come down there so he says okay he went down for summer camp and all he said i want to be a business i want to go to dollar more school of business so out of all the choices you made a decision to go to dollar more and uh your children are faced with situations some of don't know where they wanted what they want to do and there's others like rachel they know and there are others that undecided come late but hopefully it'll come because if it don't come that you know it's life is it's very chaotic when you have no direction it's very confusing when you have no direction some folks have changed from one job to another job from one thing to is the when you find you know i often times in passion for almost 50 years i oftentimes i was teach the young people sunday school and i'll try to find out you know where you want to go what you want to be what you want to do you know because the sooner you find out you can start working towards that goal but if you still trouble in them i don't know oh no and when they get around 17 18 they're still saying um oh god that's difficult because you could have built an elementary school and junior high school and you could have advanced you could be advanced but when you did not build it's difficult if you don't set certain goals and try to reach those particular goals it's difficult now what it does it causes you to be one that's unsuccessful in life you struggle with life because you did not make a decision soon enough and because you're not making a decision soon enough you may have a child and you may marry early or whatever but if you have an uncertainty about your life then all of a sudden you're raising children in uncertainty because they don't have because you don't have it so a lot of times i find those to work hard i mean they go to work every day hating it it's not something that they enjoy doing they don't love what they're doing and then there are some that enjoy the job but they're on the lowest totem pole and they just valley can get food on the table and paid iran you see what i'm saying it's because why you know the bible said godliness with contentment is great gain but you'll find that many people are not contented neither do they have god are you with me but when you got god and you're contented it doesn't matter if you just making ends meet god takes care of you day by day as long as you're happy and you got god are you what man direction which direction are you headed okay i was in prayer this morning and i was talking about direction and i said you know i was going to hold down a different direction in mullins i was talking about your inheritance and so forth on thursday night and i thought oh boy we was excited down to mullins and we had a wonderful time and i was i mean people shouting and we were shouting you know i was short you know but i thought you know i believe i shared with columbia amen but when i got here this morning and got out on my knees and started praying to god and it's just direction you know because i wanted what god wanted me to speak to you all about direction and i said huh and then which way is your life pointing is it up or is it down is it left or is it right so your life is pointing in a certain direction okay when i speak about pointing in a certain direction is your life taking you towards heaven or is your life taking you towards hell are you with me is it taking you up or is it taking you down are you with me left the goats on the left the sheep is on the right are you with me is it taking your left or taking your right are you going in the right direction or you're going in are you with me are you going into what wrong direction i don't think about it what what direction are you headed which direction are you going okay which direction do you want to go in are you up there which direction do you as an individual want to go in [Music] you know what i have about five to ten percent of the people in here this morning especially young people you know what they're saying to me leave me alone leave me alone in other words i don't want to hear it we're trying to tell you something to help you but they said just leave me alone have you heard that before parents leave me alone you're trying to help them to make decisions and they're going the right path and they just saying leave me alone but one day they wish they would have given you the opportunity to hear what you had to say are you a man it's not leave me alone can you help me mama can you help me daddy when you're reaching out for help then mama said leave me alone daddy said leave me alone grandma i'm gonna leave leave me alone now you need help you don't want to hear them say leave me alone because you were hard-headed and you didn't want to listen and now you're in a condition where you need help and sometimes you know what what the older people used to say and i'm old now if you make your bed hard what lay in it are you with me so some people make their bed hard and they want you to soften it up for are you a man they they they they they point them lives in a situation in a way that they're gonna have a hard time they're gonna have a hard life because they made no preparation for the future you must be pointed in a direction that your future could be better than others that are surrounding you you can have a better future a better life i know all parents want their children to have better than what they had not saying our lives were bad but we want our children to have a better life than we you always want them to excel you they have more than what you ever had because you want to give them all you got amen to make them better amen so by the grace of god as we look at that i want to um focus our attention a little bit on um first chronicles 28 first chronicles 28. god is good amen we'll it won't be long and i i thought about when the lord was dealing with this is around graduation time and you know some are graduating from college some are graduating from high school and some are going from uh uh elementary to middle school and some are going from middle school to high school and they have different things that they're going through and i want to say value where you are and do the best that you can you know sometimes in school i was just you know my focus is more on sports than on the books you know what i'm saying and a lot of times you know we we need to focus in on you know let's apply ourselves because you know it's not many that's going to make it the sports wise like they said education to take your long ways okay so you it'll take you a long way in this life and we want you to you know to focus in and get the help and the tutoring and whatever you need to be what where you want to go because if you don't know where you want to go you're not going to get no help if you don't care about your what you eating up see if you don't care about what you end up but when you end up you may not want to be there amen if if you're 25 and and you're still home with mama come on i know my son's still home [Laughter] but you you you know what i'm saying but don't have to be you know what i'm saying when you in a place where you got to be there are you a man so it is it's a thing you're in a place where you've got to but you're in a place where you don't have to be but you're just waiting on things to you know try to get some things together that's all right but here we were in a place where you can't help yourself are you up man i'm talking about direction i'm talking about you have left with the situations in life where you cannot progress because you have been ah goodness rachel i don't know how to put it in words you tell me don't say certain things see so you can't say certain things daddy that's not professional you're not handicapped maybe but you put yourself where you you made yourself you know ah i hope that'll pass okay you you because you can put yourself in a a way that you're going to hurt your own self she got to teach me some more you know because i you know i'm trying to do my best but by the grace of god you can put your life in a situation that you've already started your own growth your own development you made yourself a victim of circumstances that you cannot be developed because you don't have the tools anymore at your disposal when you had the tools and it was available to you you made no use of those tools now you've gotten on the road and you want to be developed but you waited too late oh you hooked me so now you're trying to hey i'm gonna do you're not come on it's just like i've i find many times on music teachers when adults come in and they're about 50 years old 60. i want to learn how to play the piano most of the teachers look at and say they they don't believe you really serious but there are some that you know they're really serious and i know this the teachers they don't want to they don't want to be bothered and that's that sometimes in life we try to somebody says well you can go to college free you know when you get a certain age i don't know but anyway a lot of things pass you by opportunities pass you by when you're young you're strong and you can think good amen now you you're not as keen and thinking you don't have the strength in the willpower that you used to have because you've gotten older amen so brother and sister i'm saying to you as young people take advantage of the opportunity that god has given you let me see what solomon here says uh ii chronicles 28-5 he said david and a sodom assembly gives counsel to israel and the solemn david giving counsel to israel and the solomons in the 5th verse 1st chronicles 28 and 5. and he says and all and of all my my sons for the lord has given me many what many sons i'm gonna tell you something it may be many many christians and many folks that say i'm saved the lord has given me many sons i'm gonna tell you the reason why you're called the bride of jesus christ because you are elect and you are chosen are you with me god has purposely by the message of monocot 4 call you out as he did david did solomon so god threw the seven angel messages called you out and he made note that you have been chosen out of all my sons david said and that's what god said out of all those christians god chose you to be his wife the bride are you with me he chose you to be the bride you could chose somebody else but he chose you you're special you are the bride if he wanted a wife he saw you and he made his decision i want you to be my bride are you with me so he says give me many sons he has chosen what he's chosen solomon he has chosen solomon brothers and sisters don't don't try to be like the rest of them you know israel wanted to be like the rest of the nations don't try to be like the rest of the people that call themselves chris god has made you special you know i don't want you to be like the rest of the nations denominations you with me because i call you as he said israel and solomon amen but i made you special i made you for this hour i've chosen you out amen that's why he said in revelation 18 uh uh come out of her my people come out of mystery babylon god chose you to come out he said come out from among them and be separate saith the lord are you with me god calls for separation god calls you to be separate special are you with me well god did not want israel to be a part of those nations because god said i made you a peculiar people i mean you're a holy nation i made you special are you with me see i'm pointing you in a different direction than everybody else everybody else going in a different direction for i'm directing you so he says in all thy ways acknowledge him and lean not to die amen don't you try to understand the way he leads i will follow amen for you you understand it better blind when the morning come god called you to be special you're just not coming to church and looking for somebody to perform or somebody just to pat you on the back amen god has a road map a road map to heaven praise god and the holy ghost is the compass are you look man the holy ghost is the carpenters deport you to the word are you with me it poaches you to jesus christ praise god people are important they admit in all the different directions they met but the holy ghost compass will point you to christ you will only point you to the word it won't puncture the creeds and dogmas of men in the denomination and men ideas are you with me but it'll only point you to jesus christ and he is the word are you with me so here solomon my son to set upon my throne of the kingdom of the lord over israel he said to them that lay out the sin known that overcome will i will set down with me in my throne are you with me so you are the overcomers in this age and this layout to see your age where they're neither hot nor cold but lukewarm he said i'll spew you out of my mouth are you with me so he says here he says and he said unto me solomon the thy son he shall build my house and my courts solomon you're chosen to build god's house and his court are you with me so the holy spirit amen in this hour amen he said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it are you with me and god is building his house a holy habitation a place where he wants to dwell are you up man you are the holy temple your body is the temple of the what holy ghost solomon was instructed to build guard a house where god could come down and be in it are you up man so god is building a house that he can come down and dwell in hallelujah for i have chosen him to be my son are you with me and i will be his father he said having therefore these promises dealing with love let us cleanse ourselves from all filterness of the flesh and of the spirit are you with me and i'll be a father unto and you shall be my sons and daughters are you up man god chose you to be his sons and daughters hallelujah amen what a great privilege we have what a blessing do we have to be god's sons and daughters he said moreover i would establish his kingdom talk about solomon forever if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day now therefore in the sight of all of israel the congregation of the lord and in the audience of our god keep and seek for all the commandments of the lord your god that ye may what possess this what this good land god got good

holy ghost you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you well you're with the promised land the promises unto you and and your children i said in your children aren't you

your will and his mind am i dreaming my dreams through my children what i wanted to be i want my children to be that for me because i did not achieve it are you up man don't let your children fulfill your dreams are you with me but you want god's perfect will for their lives do you want what's best for them or what's best for you are you a man see sometimes we struggle we want to point our children in a direction and they don't want to go to that direction and so they struggle they're trying to be what you want them to be and not what god intended for them to be from the beginning and sometimes the fight against you and to resist you sometimes the devil take them on a terrible spin through life the devil take them through some chaotic things because they're rebelling against you why because you wanted them to be something that they wasn't certain or sure of instead of being patient and praying god direct me that i can give them a thing point them in a direction that they could flow you know when they flowing and everything is just going peaceful and flowing amen you got them in the right path the right pathway amen but when they're struggling and battling and fighting and huh trying to get it and can't get it and you're still pushing them pushing you can do it take it easy it's gonna come to a breaking point sometimes and sometimes those breaking points and sometimes they come to a point and they just flat-out rebel because they got to the breaking point you broke them down and they couldn't take it no more are you with me so i'm saying don't push him to a breaking point pray get with god talk it over with jesus are you with me if i seek him he will will be found of thee are you with me but if thou forsake him are you with me but if god forsake him he will what he will cast thee all forever take heed now he says for the lord has what what the lord has chosen thee to build and house for the sanctuary be strong and what be strong and do it are you
