of the holy ghost lord we thank you tonight lord we love you and god we appreciate you lord we wouldn't trade you for nothing in this world oh god silver and gold lord as they say have i known oh god but you're worth more than silver and gold and god your world more than ten thousand worlds oh god a lifetime to live oh god you're worth more than that and lord we thank you for that tonight and god we appreciate you thank you for all of your grace and lord all of your mercy father for we love you in jesus christ's name we pray amen we want to look at the book of philippians tonight by the grace of god philippians 2. god is good amen you know i was thinking tonight as i was in prayer i said lord you know i'm so glad that one one of the things that i found when christ found me was i found rest amen i said you might not realize that realize it but when you were in sin you were taller you're working hard for the devil without finding rest but i said there's one thing that i found in christ and that was rest rest from my sinful works come on i found rest and along with that rest came peace and everything else you know as when when when christ really comes into your life there's nothing in this world that'll shake you things might happen to kind of offset you a little bit i say it like that and maybe throw you off course but so far as it shake your peace and your rest there's nothing that could take that away because he is that peace and you know that long as he's in your heart and he's there with you i don't care how dark that night get how cloudy that storm gets how much that ship might rock feel like it's going to toss over but when christ is there you don't have nothing to worry about how many believe that tonight so i was just thanking the lord for that when i was in prayer today i was just thanking the lord i said thank you for that rest you know you had to have been tall and to know what real rest is working hard to really know what real rest is real rest and what real peace is amen so i was thanking the lord for that tonight and i trust that god that you found that rest amen amen uh philippians by the grace of god philippians 2 and we'll begin at the first verse when you've got to say amen and it reads and if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being a one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves you may be seated that's a powerful word tonight and it says that you know don't let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind it says let each esteem others better than themselves look not every man unto his own things but every man also until the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion of a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also have highly exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name that at that name of jesus every knee should bow of things of heaven and things in the earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father may god bless the reading of his word again tonight by the grace of god i just want to minister to you just for a moment on a little short topic and i entitled it the character of god amen the character of god i says you know here i just reading over this scripture and it and it does something to you because paul here believes speaking out and just telling you you know about the real what real characters like and one of the things he kept pointing out was to you know let every man as we would say it like this just paraphrasing it just look on everybody else don't be concerned about yourself but be concerned about others and that's a problem today with humanity you say that's a problem yes because what's happening now we find that a lot of selfishness in the people and they can't help that because that's the way they were born you we were born selfish we were born worried about ourselves come on and how much we can do for ourselves and that's why we must be born again to get away from that nature that we might take on the the nature of god and that's what it is you know god asks us to display a certain character but he knows within ourselves that we can't live that way he knows that within ourselves we can't produce the type of character that he's requiring for us to produce and that's why he's all said like he says you know you must be born again even tell the disciples you know uh he told peter i believe it was he says after you converted then go strengthen your brothers because it's something that god has to do for you you look at the path sometimes that's set before you and you wonder god how can i walk that path but there's no way you're going to walk that path without christ in you walking that path you'll stumble and fall right by the wayside won't you because you can't walk it but god don't ask you to walk it alone but he but he but he puts his spirit in you and what he wants you to do is get out the way come on and let him like we always say uh take the helm of the ship and guide you and that's what we have a problem with letting god lead and guide us letting god completely take over our lives we have a problem with that because there's so much of our flesh is in the way we got so much of us in a way we we're looking at our statue and and what uh uh uh this is me i let nobody embarrass me ain't gonna let nobody you know uh take advantage of me and now we got too much of that in the way and then god can't have this way you know one thing about christ the whole way to calvary he never thought about being taken advantage of because he knew that you and i needed his help he knew that we couldn't come before god in the shape that we was in so when he wasn't worried about himself he knew that he had to give himself up as an offering for you and i that you and i might be able to be saved tonight so looking at him marking the perfect man come on and i said that's the man without the mark tonight how many believe that but i said the character of god i say human nature is is is is always to be uh self-centered come on me and mine that's how it is i'm worried about me and mine i ain't worried about this in my house it's my my family my long as we all right come on that's that's just the way we are within ourselves but god wants to get us away from that you know one thing when when they when they ask jesus one time tempting them they said what what's the greatest commandment and he said to love thy lord the lord thy god with all our heart with all that mind and soul he said this is the first commandment i think it was matthew 22 chapter he says but the second one he said is the the love thy neighbor is thyself come on didn't he say that and he says that that doesn't take away from the first he said on this hang all the law in the prophets come on the love thy neighbor as thyself think about it you know i said that i was thinking about something that uh uh uh the the the young man that got killed years ago emmett till as mama was saying she was saying that you know when she used to always see about the civil rights movements and all these things she said well she's living in chicago that ain't got nothing to do with me come on she said because that ain't my problem that's their problem until her son got killed then she realized that a problem for for those in the south was a problem everywhere come on but that's what it is sometimes you know we look at you know in that world has that problem not only the world the church has that problem oh that's just them that ain't us that ain't me come on but you got to realize the way the devil fighting them he might be fighting you like that tomorrow come on so what did that cause us to do cause us to pray for one another pray for that one it might not be my home but lord help him god help them through their time of trouble and they time a tribulation i know they're going through with their children god help them it might not be me today be today but remember that devil that's fighting them today he might be at your door tomorrow and you're going to need somebody to pray for you come on to pull down those strongholds then you'll wish that somebody would care about you because that's what it's all about how many believe that tonight it's about the caring that's what it is that's when we can really pull down strongholds really get down into fervent prayer for one another when you consider that hey lord we always say that that isn't their child but these are our children come on how many believe that tonight isn't just like to say brother gordon's children these are our children come on we can say it like that can we say it like that tonight come on so we find our way praying come on we got to keep the devil off off of us how many believe that tonight but we find that i said that's in the real nature of god so sometimes you know we we find we find ourselves always trying to get to that place the lord help me to express the character that you want me to express i don't want to build up my own self-image and all these things and that's a problem people want to build up their self-image when you do that don't you know god ain't in it because you're worried about yourself but you got to get away from building up your self-image god i want to project you lord and we find out here even in the scriptures how you know uh uh here how paul was laying it out and how he says though you know he he thought it not robbery to be equal with god come on but he humbled himself he made himself low come on the god of glory don't you know that you know all that god was he poured into christ what we seen out of the life of christ was the expression of the character of god of all god was we saw through the prophets and all those of those all those of old they displayed just a certain part of who he was come on they can only you can only see parts of them but when christ came on the scene he was the fullness of it and that's what it is the people couldn't see it in the fullness of it in the manifestation of it they they couldn't recognize who he was and that's why they can treat him any kind of way come on but he showed them what the character of god was like he showed them what it was like to walk lowly hallelujah come on he he made himself like the bible say of no reputation can you imagine that the god of glory the one who came down you know that worshipped of angels the creator of the world come on he made the world and he came to his own and his own received him not the the creator of becoming a part of his own creation but yet he didn't even think of it to leave of himself of no reputation but i believe in his mind the whole time he said it's written of me to do thy will oh god come on i just come to the in the volume of the book i just want to do what the will of god is and that's what it is when we you know you had to be in bad shape uh and when god saved you you had to realize how bad of a shape you were in if you didn't realize that then you wouldn't never really save right come on because you didn't recognize the need of a savior but once you realize how bad you were how low you were come on how in darkness you were how naked how blind you were hallelujah and everybody turned their back on you you found a way some somewhere in your spirit you reached out for god hallelujah god if you would help me i ain't even worthy but god if you would come by my way lord if you would stop and hear my cry because you saw how low you were hallelujah and how much god that you needed and what happened i don't know about you but i felt myself that way one day and god came by and if god came by there and lifted me up hallelujah every time i think that hey he's somebody you got this that i just go back down that that down that road go back to that place the way god brought you from i go back to that place the way i cried hallelujah and everybody looked at you and talked about you and i go back to that place where i cried out to god hallelujah and i said god i think about david he said go tell david i brought him from the sheet coat come on when he was a nobody hallelujah and i established them ain't you glad tonight that that's what god done for you hallelujah then where's bragging come on where's all these things at come on what place do those things do these things have in your life they don't have any do they recognize what god done how many believe that tonight i said but what it is you know the character of god you know you look at how meek and lowly jesus was you look at how humble he was and how he walked on the earth come on like i like that saying jesus with dirty feet you know he didn't even have a place to lay his head come on right there most of sinners the tax collectors and the harlots the humble come on but yet you had the pharisees in the scribes come on all those walking with their head high eating maybe at king's tables but yet he was he was not only 18 he was the king come on but yet look at what he chose to display himself come on and the bible says that god gave him a name that was above every name come on he showed us the way up was down didn't he showed us the way to the top so we find ourselves sometimes in what it is that type of humility it ain't you know people can put it on but he ain't asking for no put on come on but when the holy ghost really comes in your life come on the quickening power really gets down on the inside it won't be no put on because that light is so bright hallelujah it'll show you how dark you are come on it'll bring a reverence in your life i believe that with all of my heart do you believe that tonight come on so that's what we find i said lord you know it's something you know god was in christ reconciling the world to himself when he came come on he dwelled in there what he wanted to do he wanted to reconcile the world back to him he knew that you and i were lost so he wanted to do something hallelujah that nobody else couldn't do you know no angel nobody was good enough to do what he did he couldn't send nobody else you say way to glory at don't let's don't even talk about the preacher come on let's don't talk about the bishop the apostle let's talk about jesus christ he was the one hallelujah his blood that was shed he was the only one that could do it hallelujah he was the only one that could save us from our sins to reconcile us back to god no matter how good a man been how many actual works that man did he was the only one that can reconcile us back that was his purpose when he came back come on i want to reconcile him back that fellowship that was lost i want to bring it back hallelujah i thank god for bringing us back into fellowship with him oh god hallelujah come on born in the world you didn't even know what it was about come on thinking oh it's just going to church and all these things all it's just what is it all about you didn't know what that life was about until one day come on god start working on the inside he started pulling on that seed hallelujah that he placed in there before the beginning of time i thank god for that that it was by election don't you know many of us would have never chose this way come on but by election god put something on the inside of you one day he began to call in on that election that seed that was on the inside and i don't care how clouded it was by the world come on in darkness it was clouded by those things covered up but when god began to call on it you couldn't explain it something was drawing you out and i thank god for the drawing out how many thank god for the drawing out tonight i said ain't you glad that god dropped you out tonight hallelujah ain't you glad that you it was something different about you than everybody else come on you was an oddball but what it was it was god that did it come on i thank god for that tonight but i said what it is the character of god he was displaying something come on god was in christ what he was doing uh or displaying something in you i mean displaying something within himself of showing what real christianity is like don't you know that today the world don't know what christianity is they lost they lost at that part come on they don't know what real christianity is like they don't really know what you know the spirit of god is coming down into a man's life cleaning them up they don't know they use that phrase born again any kind of way come on they use the term the holy ghost any type of way come on but they don't really know what it's like come on how do you say that because you can look at the life that they live come on it ain't producing the word come on it ain't producing the life of christ it ain't doing what the bible declared it would do so you call it like it is come on hallelujah you know i think about jesus and jesus began to talk about the pharisees come on he just began to call and said it you know the separate countries and all these things said their wider rules they full of dead men bones come on all corruption i believe john the baptist when he saw him hallelujah call them snakes vipers he said who warned you to flee the wrath to come come on though they might have been dressed in white robes going to church the preachers of that day come on the life that they was projecting what in the life of christ and i said today what does god find today people do the same thing having church in church come on but the life they projected ain't the life of christ come on i said lord give us something real hallelujah something that'll change a man from where he is and bring him to a real birth hallelujah take the taste of alcohol out of his mouth he can have a testimony and i ain't the shame of who i was hallelujah a real birth come on you know i was thinking i thank god i was sharing my sister-in-law kente was telling me the other day when brother damon was testifying i could never imagine seeing you do any things that they talk about i said thank the lord for the new birth because what it is people of old they know you and they can't believe you live the way you live they can't believe it but then the people that didn't know you they they can't believe you lived that way what it is because they were two different people come on two different natures hallelujah it's the nature of god hallelujah now what it is and that's what you want you want something when christ comes in you come on he says all things will become new come on not that you wondering have i been changed or not but when the holy ghost comes in you you'll know that something quick in you because you ain't dead no more to those things your whole appetite has changed hallelujah the life of christ is in you and what it is it's about that personal relationship you know i was sharing with the church the other other week i was saying you know when you when just coming to church that's only maybe 10 of this whole journey come on i said but this you don't just say i'm just a christian just here i said but it's only 10 come on the life that you live come on most of the time you ain't even in the building i said let's see what kind of life you're living out there that's what's going to testify no matter how much you dance shout sing speak in tongues none of that even matters what kind of life are you producing hallelujah it's the life of christ and if you can't see that life when you get up in the morning or when you lay down at night then you got to get on the alt and die again cry out for more of god i don't know about you but i need more of god every day every morning every hour i need more of his spirit power hallelujah with the things we're fighting against today come on the battles this is sad i was seeing something and how they were saying about the mothers are tired of losing their children to gun violence it was a whole crowd of mothers every one of them was black i said that that hurt your heart come on why i said we need god to help us come on we need prayer in the homes again need prayer somebody hallelujah call on god how many believe that tonight come on not taken away but it's the truth you know we need god more than we think we do come on that's the pr that's a problem we need god more than we think we need them hallelujah but we find i says you know what it is uh christ like it says reconciling what he what he was showing the characteristics of god he was showing you know uh uh of real what real christianity was like come on he was showing it to us how many believe that tonight come on and i says god you know when you know when you look in the word what reflection are you seeing a lot of times you know i says what happens a lot of times we can look at characters in the bible and this is what this is what sometimes the enemy calls a person to do they'll look at their mistakes and their flaws a lot of times you hear them say you know david was a man after god's own heart and look what he did and god forgave him so nobody can't judge me that's the attitude of the world was also a trick of the devil come on you know that you know that's the uk the bible said for those that willfully sin come on there won't be no forgiveness for that you know david was a man after god's own heart that's because he possessed certain qualities come on there's certain qualities that david possessed david was willing to repent too wasn't he and i believe if it was laid before him again that david wouldn't do those things but a lot of times you know we use other people's faults and transgressions to the devil trick you to use those things as a cloak for your sins come on but we shouldn't use those things as a cloak come on but we should what follow after the things that are right and pure you sometimes we might get caught in a snare or a trap but what happens the holy spirit be quick to convict you and bring you back to a place the way you say god i need your mercy lord cast me not away from thy presence come on take not that holy spirit away from me restoring to me the joy of my salvation a man to be quick to repent do you believe that tonight hallelujah i believe that but i said that's what happens come on a lot of times you know we we just got to be careful what the enemy does come on what the enemy is seeking to do in each and every one of our lives i said that you know each one of those each one of those characters they displayed certain parts of them but christ himself when he came he was the fullness of it come on showing us or what the real i don't want to belong what the real character of god is like come on and i said god looking at the scriptures you can go home and re read it uh finish reading it yourself you know and i was gonna go over to hebrews 10 and how you know paul was talking about call back the days of old he says when you were made of gays in stock and all these things because why you didn't mind going through for christ why because you know you needed this help you knew you needed god's help and you was willing to do anything to get god's help but what happens to a person to to a human a person in that christian walk god lifts them up out of the tragic situations god lifts them up out of the pits of hell come on and as soon as they get lifted up won't be long before they forget the one that brought them come on then beginning to feel as though they're strong and they can do things on their own but remember you can't do nothing on your own come on without god hold in your hand do you believe that tonight amen [Applause] praise the lord amen i thank god that the private of god said one thing you'll take out you bought nothing in this world one thing you take out is your character amen so here we are traveling through this world what it's got he's looking for character amen he's looking for and i was back there listening and i said the church is the body of christ and um we have to look and see our lives can we be called the body of christ he said not not just the holy ghost being a a different person than jesus christ but it's the same person the holy ghost is jesus christ the same person that we preach about we talk about but the holy ghost is the same person it's not three persons in the god it's the same person amen and that same person must be your pur must be the person of jesus christ to you amen in reality form and your life being transformed and changed into that image that we'll see jesus christ and not ourselves amen and so that's the purpose of jesus christ coming back in the form of the holy ghost amen that you might have the same power the same god living and manifesting himself in you praise god if god manifests himself in you even then the works that he did you'll do also praise god we it's not something that we're just trying to work up when we just talk about it's something that's real it's genuine it's the power of god it's the same jesus doing the same works hallelujah hallelujah bro you know private god said the devil is trying to disarm you he's trying to amen the bible said put on the whole arm of god but the devil would disarm you amen he'll try to take away your armor amen by amen you got to believe amen that jesus christ has armed you with his word but the devil are trying to disarm you to get you to doubt the word he's no match for the word but the devil will try to get you to doubt the word but you got to let the devil know i i know you're a liar and god said put on the whole arm of god that you may be able to withstand that you can stand against the wiles of the devil y'all thank god i didn't think i'd make it tonight was at the josh graduation and it got caught in the rain got wet so i just said well i told kill let's just go try to make it anyway so we i said in the back i wasn't expecting to be called up but by the grace of god i thank the lord amen i'll tell you what you got to give god every bit
