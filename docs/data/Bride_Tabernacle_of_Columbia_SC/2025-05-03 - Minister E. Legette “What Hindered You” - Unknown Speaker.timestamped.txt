[37:45] to crown you with praise, Lord. Oh, God,
[37:48] truly worthy of all the praise and all
[37:51] the honor and the glory,
[37:53] Lord. God, we just thank you, Lord,
[37:55] tonight for granting us traveling
[37:57] mercies, Lord, and blessing us to be
[38:00] able to come back to your presence,
[38:01] Lord. God, seeing that your people have
[38:04] pressed their way, Lord, I I know you
[38:06] got a blessing, Lord, in store. For God,
[38:09] you said where two or three are gathered
[38:10] in my name, there I be in the midst. And
[38:12] God, I pray, Lord, tonight that you
[38:14] would bless us, Lord. I pray for the
[38:16] sick and afflicted, Lord. The ones that
[38:18] desired to be here, Lord, but were
[38:20] troubled in mind or heart tonight. Oh
[38:22] God, I'm just tired of the flesh. God, I
[38:25] pray, God, that you would bless them,
[38:26] Lord. Pray, oh God, a double blessing
[38:29] upon your children, Lord. Oh God, that
[38:31] you would give us strength, Lord, to
[38:33] carry on, Lord. I just thank you, Lord.
[38:35] Pray God, if we said or done anything
[38:37] that ain't like you, Lord, that would
[38:39] cause, Lord, a hindrance of the move,
[38:41] God, tonight, I just pray, Lord, that
[38:43] you'd forgive us and oh God, you'd help
[38:45] us get out of the way, Lord. That we
[38:47] might God get a word from your throne,
[38:49] Lord, God, something that'll revive us
[38:52] again, Lord, as oh God, upon revival. We
[38:54] just thank you, Lord. We love you and we
[38:57] appreciate you for all the many
[38:58] blessings, God, that you've given us. We
[39:01] thank you. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[39:03] we pray. Amen.
[39:05] [Music]
[39:07] Amen. Amen. We want to look at the book
[39:09] of Galatians. By the grace of God,
[39:12] Galatians
[39:14] 5, God is good. Amen.
[39:17] Galatians 5.
[39:30] You got to say amen. Amen. And it reads,
[39:33] we'll begin at the at the seventh
[39:37] verse. It
[39:39] says here at the seventh verse, he says,
[39:42] "You did run well. Who did hinder you
[39:46] that you should not obey the truth? This
[39:49] persuasion cometh
[39:51] not of him that calleth you. A little
[39:54] leaven le 11 le 11 le 11 le 11 le 11 le
[39:55] 11 le 11 le 11 le 11 le 11 leavenventh
[39:55] the whole lump. You may be seated. I'm
[39:57] going to read a little further down.
[39:59] Amen. He says a little 11 le 11 le 11 le
[40:01] 11 le 11 le 11 le 11 le 11 le 11 le 11
[40:01] le 11 in the whole lump. Amen. Let's
[40:03] drop down to the 16th verse. He says
[40:05] here this I say then walk in the spirit
[40:10] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[40:13] flesh.
[40:15] For the flesh lusteth against the
[40:17] spirit, and the spirit against the
[40:19] flesh, and these are contrary the one to
[40:22] the other, so that ye cannot do the
[40:25] things that you would. But if you be led
[40:28] of the spirit, ye are not under the law.
[40:31] Now the works of the flesh are manifest
[40:34] which are these: adultery, fornication,
[40:38] uncleanness, lascivveness, idolatry,
[40:41] witchcraft, hatred, variance,
[40:43] emulations, wrath, strife, strife,
[40:47] sedition, and heresies, envyings,
[40:50] murders, drunkenness, reings, and such
[40:53] like of the which I to I tell you
[40:56] before, as I have also told you in times
[41:00] pass that they which do such things
[41:04] shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[41:06] But the spirit of
[41:12] love but the fruit fruit of the spirit I
[41:16] don't have my thank y'all tonight. But
[41:19] the fruit of the spirit is love, joy,
[41:22] peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[41:24] goodness, and faith, meekness,
[41:27] temperance. Against such there is no
[41:30] law. May God have bless your reading of
[41:32] his word tonight. God is good. Amen. So
[41:35] we pressed our way out tonight. Amen.
[41:37] And storm is sounding pretty bad out
[41:39] there, ain't it? But I said, you know,
[41:42] uh God is good to us, ain't it? So we
[41:44] didn't let nothing hinder us tonight.
[41:45] Amen. It says you did run real well.
[41:48] What hindered you? Sometime the storm
[41:50] will hinder you on it. But I want to say
[41:53] tonight instead of of who hindered you,
[41:55] I want to say what hindered you. Amen.
[41:57] And we're talking about hinders. Just
[41:59] just a little something simple tonight.
[42:01] Amen. And I believe it's simple, but I
[42:03] believe it's powerful cuz the Lord was
[42:05] dealing with me on some things. Amen.
[42:07] And I ministering on Sunday, but I said,
[42:10] you know, what hindered you? Amen. A lot
[42:12] of times, you know, um, and we coming
[42:15] down to the end. This this is the last,
[42:18] we can we say the last mile of the day.
[42:21] Even if the Lord should, you know, time
[42:23] is sweeping by fast, ain't it?
[42:26] You know, age sweeping by fast. So I
[42:29] says the little the little time that we
[42:32] have here on earth is and we can never
[42:34] stress that is nothing compared to
[42:36] eternity. Amen. But you know so a lot of
[42:40] times what we find is that you know and
[42:43] it's been the same trick of the enemy.
[42:45] Uh the people start off running right
[42:48] but something along the way hinders
[42:50] them. Amen. We look at the the in the
[42:53] church, the f early church, the book of
[42:55] acts and how they were moving in power
[42:57] and and you know even the shadows of the
[43:00] apostles and all that was healing the
[43:01] people but they were in a a mighty
[43:02] revival right but something walked them
[43:05] down but the first thing that happened
[43:07] we know the enemy came in and he began
[43:09] to attack the word because he knew that
[43:12] if he can get them away from that word
[43:15] amen the original even mix it with a
[43:17] little bit come on then he knew that
[43:20] that he he would be taking their power
[43:22] from them. Right? So that little
[43:25] drifting right there it it but we find
[43:28] that and I says that and that's what it
[43:30] is even today. You know you look at your
[43:32] own Christian journey and you you can
[43:34] never be satisfied like I'm satisfied
[43:37] where I'm at. Put it that way. You
[43:39] satisfied with Jesus now but I'm
[43:42] satisfied where I but you always in your
[43:45] heart God I need more of you. Come on.
[43:48] And then so many people they think I I
[43:50] just that's it. I I'm on my way and they
[43:53] just come in and out of church, but they
[43:55] don't expect more. But I believe that
[43:57] cuz God put it in my heart. I says,
[43:59] "God, I I I some might feel you got
[44:02] enough." But I said, "Lord, I need more
[44:04] of you. Come on." Because I know that
[44:06] what what
[44:08] we are right now, it's going to take
[44:10] some extra from God. I believe that it's
[44:13] going to take the the drippings.
[44:15] Hallelujah. We're going to have to be up
[44:17] under that throne. Come on. Up under in
[44:20] his presence daily. But I said I said,
[44:22] "What hindered you?" You know, a lot of
[44:24] times I said, you know, looking back at
[44:27] the scriptures and how, you know, God
[44:31] God knew what he was do what what he's
[44:33] doing when he's telling you to get rid
[44:34] of certain things. Come on. When God
[44:37] saved you and he start dealing with your
[44:39] life and and he start working with you
[44:41] on certain things, he knows what he's
[44:43] doing. Come on. Some people say, "Well,
[44:46] that ain't a sin." Just like Paul, he
[44:47] was talking about it. Some things they
[44:49] ain't they ain't expeding. He said, "It
[44:51] ain't unlawful, but I just don't do it."
[44:53] Come on. It's certain areas in your life
[44:56] that you knew that the devil had a
[44:58] stronghold on you. Come on. In those
[45:01] areas, I was sharing with with a person
[45:03] and they cuz they were so saved. I said,
[45:04] "The thing is, you still got to be wise
[45:06] as a serpent, harmless as a dove. You
[45:09] got to guard certain areas. Come on.
[45:12] Even with the Holy Ghost, you got to
[45:14] guard certain areas. Come on. You don't
[45:16] put yourself out there to be tested like
[45:18] that. Now, if God sends a test, he'll
[45:20] give you strength to pass it. But you
[45:23] put yourself in certain situations, you
[45:24] going to be in bad trouble, bad shape.
[45:27] So, some things you you flee from. Amen.
[45:30] Come on. They say, "Oh, well, you you
[45:32] you afraid." No. I'm I I said, "Lord, I
[45:34] want you to keep me." I'm not going to
[45:36] I'm not going to tell I believe God can
[45:37] keep us because he's been keeping us so
[45:40] far. Come on. But I don't I'm not going
[45:43] to put God to the test like that. Amen.
[45:46] Come on. But I say it's what it is. You
[45:48] know, uh uh God knows what he's doing
[45:50] when it's certain things in your life
[45:52] God ask you to cut off. Come on. You
[45:55] know, I was I was sharing a testimony. I
[45:57] said, "The thing is when coming to the
[45:59] Lord and it's obvious certain things you
[46:01] got you you you got to cut off from your
[46:03] life and you look at those things and
[46:05] you say, "Okay, those are easy to get
[46:07] rid of." But what the Lord showed me was
[46:10] it's certain things about your very
[46:12] nature, the genes from where you was
[46:15] born, certain things about about you,
[46:18] hallelujah, that uh attached the self to
[46:22] your spirit and God. And those were the
[46:24] hard things to deal with. But the reason
[46:26] being because they were sometimes a very
[46:29] part of you, right? But they carried a
[46:31] spirit that wouldn't allow you to get
[46:33] where you needed to be to really get
[46:35] filled with the Holy Ghost. Come on.
[46:38] They kept you just maybe just a little
[46:40] bit below that level. But God uh in in
[46:42] certain things you can't and I'm going
[46:45] say it like this. You can't fight on
[46:46] your own. It takes you getting down on
[46:48] your knees and saying, "Lord, I need you
[46:50] to help me. Deliver me from this God."
[46:53] Come on. It takes that sometimes. Oh,
[46:56] no. It takes you saying God cuz if you
[46:58] you on your own doing that, you might
[47:00] say, "Okay, I think I'm good now." But
[47:02] and it and it don't be it still be
[47:04] there. But when God get done with it,
[47:07] come on. When God gets finished with it,
[47:10] come on. When God comes down, then
[47:12] you're a new creature. Amen. You did
[47:14] more than just turn a leaf, but you had
[47:16] a born again experience. Your whole
[47:19] appetite changed. That's what we got to
[47:21] that's what God dealing with. Your whole
[47:22] appetite got to change. what you were
[47:25] has got to disgust you. Amen. Come on.
[47:28] And like I I share with people all the
[47:29] time, there certain things that I could
[47:31] do, but I don't do it because I felt
[47:34] like for the Lord saved me that was a
[47:37] must part of me, right? And it made me
[47:39] walk a certain way, act a certain way.
[47:41] So I just I just laid those things down
[47:44] just so I could not saying get that
[47:47] closer to God, but I laid those things
[47:49] God down to show to show God that God, I
[47:51] mean business with you. You're asking me
[47:53] to live a certain way, God. That's what
[47:55] I want to do. Hallelujah. And when you
[47:57] get down to business with God, it's one
[47:59] thing about God. I was meditating. I
[48:01] said he's not a man that he should lie.
[48:04] It's impossible for God to lie. You do
[48:06] your part and God is going to fulfill
[48:08] his part every single time. Come on. He
[48:11] said he'll give the Holy Ghost to them
[48:13] that what? Obey him. You do your part
[48:16] and watch God do his part. He It's
[48:18] impossible for him to lie now. Come on.
[48:21] That stirred my heart. just thinking
[48:22] about God, it's impossible for you to
[48:24] lie. Come on. And I start thinking about
[48:27] all the promises that God made us. And I
[48:30] start thinking about the mountains
[48:31] that's in our way from getting those
[48:33] promises. But then it rings in my spirit
[48:35] that it's impossible for God to lie what
[48:38] he said he'll do. Come on. And I'm
[48:42] resting on that. Mountain move out of my
[48:45] way. Come on. Hallelujah.
[48:49] I was having myself. I said, "Lord,
[48:51] that's what it is. It's impossible for
[48:53] you to lie. I can't doubt God." Why? Cuz
[48:55] it's impossible for him to lie.
[48:57] Hallelujah. But I says, you know what
[48:59] hindered you? Something got to stir you
[49:01] up. Amen. Come on. You know many things
[49:04] I says, uh, God when he's told Israel in
[49:07] those, go into the land and I want you
[49:09] to destroy all the inhabitants of it.
[49:11] Right? But many times you might they
[49:13] might have looked at the little babies
[49:14] or the little things that and as as Saul
[49:17] got caught up in that once things that
[49:19] weren't vile and and refusable. I keep
[49:21] those because it seem harmless. But come
[49:23] on, God knows what he's God when God
[49:25] tell you to do something he knows what
[49:27] he's talking about. Come on. What you
[49:29] think is harmless just like he told uh
[49:31] uh uh uh Israel those he says if you
[49:34] don't if you don't uh uh uh root them
[49:36] out. Come on. He says they'll they'll
[49:38] grow up. There'll be a a prick in your
[49:40] eyes. I thought about that. I said
[49:43] there'll be a prick in your eyes now.
[49:45] They going you your vision might start
[49:46] off right, but sooner or later you let
[49:48] it stay around. It's going it's going to
[49:50] damage your eyesight now. Come on.
[49:52] You're going to lose the f the vision
[49:54] that you first had, you going to lose it
[49:55] at some point. Come on. He said that not
[49:58] only that, there'll be a what? A thorn
[49:59] in your side. Right. Somewhere along the
[50:02] line if you don't if if you don't root
[50:04] it out. Come on.
[50:07] If you don't stomp stamp it out
[50:08] somewhere along the line, come on. It's
[50:11] going to walk you down. Come on. You can
[50:13] go to church year in and year out. Be
[50:14] the most faithful person. But if you
[50:17] don't give it all to God, let it all go.
[50:19] It's going to walk you down at some
[50:20] point. Come on. It might seem harmless,
[50:23] but you know, one thing about it, I was
[50:25] sharing I was sharing with the guys at
[50:27] work was I was talking about the devil.
[50:29] I said the devil ain't got no no um no
[50:31] horns in a pitchfork and all that. Come
[50:34] on. Because it didn't look like the
[50:35] devil. you wouldn't go nowhere near him.
[50:38] But I was just talking like that and one
[50:40] of the guys at work, he said, "Ernest,
[50:41] man, hold up. Let me get my phone out."
[50:43] I said, "I want," he said, "I want my
[50:44] family to hear this." He said, "We ought
[50:46] to put it on the internet. Everybody
[50:48] need to hear this." He said, "Cuz you
[50:50] you don't think about it that way." I
[50:51] said, "The devil, but no matter how what
[50:53] form he comes in, the devil is the
[50:55] devil." Come on. And he ain't got but
[50:57] what? Three things to do. Kill, steal,
[51:00] and what? Destroy. That's his job. The
[51:03] devil don't care nothing about you.
[51:04] Amen. And sometimes we we we we we think
[51:08] within ourselves that we just be in the
[51:10] middle of the road. I'm not going to
[51:11] serve God all the way and I'm not going
[51:12] to be. It's no middle of the road. Come
[51:14] on. Come
[51:16] on. Hallelujah.
[51:19] Then without the spirit of God, there
[51:20] ain't none of his. Right. Come on. You
[51:23] got to find yourself on one side or the
[51:25] other. Come on. And that's what it is.
[51:27] You know, even even uh he was talking
[51:29] here about how the flesh and the spirit
[51:32] come on. That this is this I mean Yeah.
[51:34] the flesh and the spirit. Well, this is
[51:35] a war, right? Come on. They contrary one
[51:39] to another, ain't they? Come on. What
[51:41] your soul is is desired and and what
[51:44] your soul needs is contrary to what your
[51:46] flesh want. Come on. It is. The fleshly
[51:51] things will make you feel good in the
[51:53] flesh sometimes. Come on. And the and
[51:55] the more wicked it is, sometimes it look
[51:58] like the more pleasure it should be. But
[52:00] what is it doing? It's starving your
[52:02] soul out. Come on. You'll find out one
[52:05] day that you ain't where you think you
[52:07] ought to be at now. Come on. But God
[52:10] will expose you and show that you naked.
[52:13] Come on. You weighed in the balance and
[52:15] found want. And I said, God, don't let
[52:17] me be like that. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus.
[52:20] Search me now. That's one thing about
[52:22] it. People say, "Uh uh uh oh, you can't
[52:26] judge. You don't judge." But we know
[52:28] judgment begins at the house of God. And
[52:30] the thing is when when when you
[52:32] preaching the word or declaring the
[52:35] word, it's not that you judging. You
[52:36] just declaring what the Bible says. Come
[52:39] on. And people get mad with what the
[52:42] Bible say. Amen. Come on. And sometimes
[52:45] you feel bad, but they get mad with what
[52:46] the word of God say. Just like the night
[52:48] the word of God talked about the the the
[52:50] things that the flesh like, fornication,
[52:52] adultery, all these things. It was a
[52:54] whole list of things. Come on. He says,
[52:56] "But I'm going to tell you like I told
[52:58] you once, they that do these things,
[53:00] they ain't going to inherit the kingdom
[53:01] of God." You can't tell people they
[53:04] going to heaven, they going to be all
[53:05] right doing those things. Come on. You
[53:07] can't inherit the kingdom that way.
[53:09] That's the word. Hallelujah. And people
[53:12] get mad when you say that. But all
[53:14] you're trying to do is help them make
[53:16] heaven their home. All you're trying to
[53:18] do is help them get right with God so
[53:20] the windows of heaven can open up and
[53:22] God can pour out blessings on their
[53:24] life. That's all you're trying to do.
[53:26] Come on. Cuz you know what it takes. God
[53:29] showed us what it takes, don't he? Come
[53:31] on. Hallelujah. I said, "What hinders
[53:35] you?" Come on. You know, I we find I
[53:38] said sometimes, you know, we was talking
[53:40] about the devil, right?
[53:43] And one of the guys at work, he started
[53:46] saying something about the pope and he
[53:49] pulled up a picture of of the pope
[53:52] kissing the the president of Sudan feet.
[53:55] Come on now. How you going to have more
[53:58] love than that? Come on. Looked like it,
[54:01] ain't it? And he was a black man, too.
[54:04] Come on. How you how you going to have
[54:05] more love than that? Right. And it and
[54:08] uh you read the the thing the whole the
[54:10] whole dialogue what was going on at the
[54:12] time and he was talking about the the
[54:14] peace and how but he sounds everybody
[54:17] using the word humble and humility. He
[54:19] had more humility than Jesus didn't he?
[54:22] Come on now kissing the people feet. So
[54:26] you he get you what I say what the devil
[54:29] does the devil he he'll have you looking
[54:32] at him like he can't do no wrong. Right?
[54:35] Come on. Can I say it like that tonight?
[54:38] The devil crafty now. Come on. He's so
[54:41] good that you can't say nothing bad
[54:42] about him. Come on. But no matter what,
[54:45] he's still the what? Devil, ain't he?
[54:47] Come on. He's still the devil. Y'all
[54:50] believe that? How good he is, how good
[54:52] he sound, he's still the devil, right?
[54:55] Come on. And it when he's going against
[54:56] the word of God, we know what that is,
[54:58] ain't it? Come on. But one thing about
[55:00] it, that's what what people want. Uh
[55:04] sometimes we we see that and I guess
[55:06] it's just because of that's what the
[55:08] flesh like, right? The flesh want that
[55:10] always. Oh, just just we going to all be
[55:14] all right. Everybody take in. We going
[55:16] to all be all right. The flesh loved
[55:17] that. Come on. But when Jesus came in,
[55:20] come on. Let's talk about John the
[55:22] Baptist said, "You you you snakes, come
[55:25] on, vipers, right? Repent or perish."
[55:29] That's what they was preaching, right?
[55:30] Jesus came in the temple. Come on. and
[55:33] whip them out of it. Right? See, they
[55:34] don't Oh, but but here go the old devil.
[55:37] They all right. Come on. Oh, but one
[55:40] thing about it, God come to clean us up,
[55:42] don't he? That's what it is. God to show
[55:45] you what kind of shape you in. If he
[55:47] don't show you what kind of shape you
[55:48] in, you'll think you're all right. Come
[55:50] on. Amen. I'm so glad that God showed me
[55:53] what shape I was in. I'm so glad that
[55:56] God showed me that I was lost on my way
[55:58] to hell needing a savior. Come on. No
[56:01] matter how how cool or whatever I
[56:03] thought I was, God showed me one day,
[56:06] you ratchet, you're miserable, you're
[56:07] blind, naked, come unto me and bow me.
[56:10] Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Come on. And I
[56:14] came to him just like I was. Hallelujah.
[56:17] Come on. But I says, the thing is, come
[56:19] on. What what hindered you?
[56:21] Hallelujah. Come on. Or or or like we
[56:24] say, what hinders you? Or or in some
[56:26] cases, we can say, who hindered you? But
[56:28] I says what it is. You know, a lot of
[56:31] times, you know, I wanted to talk about
[56:33] a few things I might skip all over. You
[56:35] know, there several things
[56:37] that like the scriptures here declaring
[56:40] several things that hinder us that that
[56:43] uh are become stumbling blocks and come
[56:46] on and they keep you those things can't
[56:47] inherit the kingdom. Come on. What's the
[56:50] kingdom is righteousness, peace, and
[56:52] joy. Right? Certain things you lost your
[56:55] joy. Come on. You lost your peace, but
[56:57] it's something that robs you of that.
[56:59] Amen. Come on. It's something that stop
[57:02] the the windows up, stop the well up.
[57:05] Hallelujah. The way no matter how happy
[57:08] you ought to be, you can't get to that
[57:10] type of joy, right? Because money,
[57:13] nothing else can't provide that type of
[57:15] joy. Hallelujah. Nothing else can't
[57:18] provide that type of peace but God
[57:20] himself. Come on.
[57:23] And it's things that that'll stop it up,
[57:25] ain't it? Come on. One of the one of the
[57:27] things I was looking at here is he was
[57:29] as he was talking in in the 20th verse
[57:32] about idolatry. Amen. Come on. Many
[57:35] times we don't think about that. I want
[57:37] to say tonight, anything that you put
[57:39] before God is an idol. Come on.
[57:43] Anything.
[57:45] Wife, children, money, anything you put
[57:48] before God is an idol. Come on. Ain't
[57:51] it'll stop the well up, won't it? I
[57:54] says, I was saying the other day, and I
[57:57] I say it to myself all the time, you
[57:59] can't let nothing get in between you and
[58:01] God. Hallelujah. Come on. You can't let
[58:05] nothing You can't get out of the out of
[58:06] God's will for nothing. Come
[58:09] on. I look at it like this. The things
[58:12] that that that the devil wants you to
[58:14] get out of God's will for, remember, if
[58:16] it's God will for you to have it, he'll
[58:18] bless it.
[58:20] Come on.
[58:21] You don't have to get out of his will to
[58:23] get it. Come on. Amen. God will give you
[58:27] riches with no sorrow on it. Hallelujah.
[58:30] You going to have to lose or give up
[58:31] your prayer time. Give up your time with
[58:34] God. Would God bless you? If he intend
[58:37] for you to keep it, you'll keep it.
[58:39] Hallelujah. I'm a firm believer. I'm a
[58:42] witness. Hallelujah.
[58:44] Oh Jesus. So it's no doubt in our minds.
[58:47] What are we going to do? Hallelujah. We
[58:49] going to stay with God. Come on. Oh,
[58:51] Jesus. Amen. But the devil, what he
[58:54] does, he he he tricks us. Come on. I say
[58:56] anything you put before God is an idol.
[58:59] Anything. That's right. Come on. And it
[59:02] contaminates your spirit.
[59:05] You know, you know the devil. The devil
[59:07] been studying you since you was born. He
[59:09] knows what your daddy struggle with,
[59:10] your granddaddy, and everybody struggle
[59:12] with. Amen. Come on. Amen. So, he knows
[59:15] he's got you figured out, right? Come
[59:18] on.
[59:19] So he knows what to offer you. Y'all
[59:21] believe that tonight?
[59:23] He knows. And he keep flashing it before
[59:25] you. You'll fall one day. Hallelujah.
[59:27] But it's one thing about it. I might
[59:29] have been born with certain genes, but
[59:30] when the Holy Ghost came, Hallelujah. Oh
[59:33] Jesus. All that was wiped away. I don't
[59:36] have that appetite, desire. The only
[59:38] thing that that that gets me going is
[59:40] the things of God. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus.
[59:44] Come on. That's what lifts me up when
[59:46] I'm down in the in the mud. Hallelujah.
[59:48] What I'm going through, that's what
[59:50] lifts me out of it. Come on. And that's
[59:53] what ought to lift you out of it
[59:54] tonight. Hallelujah. I believe that.
[59:56] Come on. But I says, you know, one thing
[59:59] about it, you know, there's a lot of I
[1:00:01] says a lot of things. Come on. Stumble
[1:00:04] you, won't it? Be a hindrance to you.
[1:00:07] You know, I I I was looking here. He was
[1:00:09] talking about hatred, right? Come on.
[1:00:12] Hate. Hate is a strong thing. Amen.
[1:00:14] Ain't it? And I don't believe that it
[1:00:19] may have it may have even started out
[1:00:20] with
[1:00:21] hate. It may have been something real
[1:00:24] small, a misunderstanding or something
[1:00:27] real small. Now, but it material, it
[1:00:31] grew into hate. By the time the devil
[1:00:33] got big, he was hate then, right? Come
[1:00:36] on. And that's why the devil don't want
[1:00:39] people working things out now. Come on.
[1:00:41] Amen. Amen. The devil don't want people
[1:00:43] talking and working things out. Amen. He
[1:00:45] wants you to keep that thing in your
[1:00:47] spirit because he knows it's a stumbling
[1:00:49] block to you. He knows if you hold on to
[1:00:51] it when you pray, God ain't even hearing
[1:00:53] you. Come on. Oh Jesus. So he wants you
[1:00:57] to let it go. No. Come on. I don't know
[1:00:59] about you, but I want God to hear my
[1:01:01] prayer. Hallelujah. When I'm down on my
[1:01:03] knees, it's calling. I want God to hear.
[1:01:05] Oh Jesus. Come on. But what it does, I
[1:01:09] believe that certain things it it grow
[1:01:11] into that, don't it? Come on. And what
[1:01:13] it is, like we said, it be a little
[1:01:15] devil now turn into something
[1:01:18] big. Come on. But that's what the devil
[1:01:21] does. Y'all believe that tonight. But I
[1:01:24] says one thing about it. Come, one thing
[1:01:25] about it. I says when in in this
[1:01:28] journey, so many it's so many things he
[1:01:30] was talking about envy and all that. And
[1:01:32] I wonder I don't have time tonight, but
[1:01:34] we can go through and break each and
[1:01:36] every one of those things down and show
[1:01:38] you uh uh show scripturally how these
[1:01:41] things come on. throw the people off.
[1:01:43] But he says, and what it is, these
[1:01:46] things, the ones that they this this
[1:01:49] can't inherit the kingdom. Come on. Our
[1:01:52] whole goal here today and all our
[1:01:56] running is to make heaven our home. Come
[1:01:58] on. To be in the kingdom of God. You
[1:02:02] going to let hatred, envy, any little
[1:02:05] thing going to stop you. Come on. You
[1:02:07] did run well. What? What happened? Amen.
[1:02:10] What got in your spirit that got you all
[1:02:12] messed up? Come on.
[1:02:16] What did the preacher say to get you all
[1:02:17] hurt? Come on.
[1:02:20] Get y'all offended. Now you can't get
[1:02:22] the blessings because your ears are
[1:02:24] stopped up. Come on.
[1:02:28] Let it go and let God bless you.
[1:02:30] Hallelujah. Come on. Let it go. Let's
[1:02:32] get make heaven our home tonight. Come
[1:02:34] on. Oh Jesus. Come on. I don't know. I

[1:02:47] on now. They that do these things can't
[1:02:50] inherit the kingdom. Right. Come on. But
[1:02:54] I says what it is. We We don't realize
[1:02:57] tonight. I'll cut it short. We don't
[1:02:58] realize tonight. I says
[1:03:01] um the privilege that we have. Amen. I
[1:03:05] was sharing with the guys last night. I
[1:03:06] said, "We we don't realize the privilege
[1:03:09] that we have." I was sharing with them
[1:03:12] about I think it was a boy over in North
[1:03:14] Korea. He was from right here in in
[1:03:16] America, but he went over there and he
[1:03:17] he left a Bible in the hotel
[1:03:19] room and they they locked him up for
[1:03:25] propaganda and they tortured him. And by
[1:03:28] the time he got back, they finally
[1:03:30] released him, he came back over to
[1:03:32] America with his parents and he died.
[1:03:35] Come on.
[1:03:37] I says, "All because he brought a Bible
[1:03:40] with him and they don't allow that over
[1:03:41] there and left it in the hotel room." I
[1:03:44] says, "But I was telling the boys at at
[1:03:47] work last night, you and I, come on. We
[1:03:50] can bring our Bibles to work."
[1:03:51] Hallelujah. We can have our Bibles
[1:03:54] everywhere we go, but we won't even read
[1:03:55] them now. Come on. Hallelujah.
[1:03:59] I was talking to them about the the Fox
[1:04:01] Book of Motors and how so many went
[1:04:04] through. I say what it is. This gospel
[1:04:06] is dripping with blood. Hallelujah.
[1:04:09] A lot of them had to deal with those
[1:04:12] things. And you and I today right now
[1:04:15] anyway got the liberty. Hallelujah. To
[1:04:18] search God's word out. Come on. Amen.
[1:04:21] Not only that, to gather together and
[1:04:23] hear it and be blessed. The gospel is
[1:04:25] dripping with blood. We don't realize
[1:04:27] how good we got it sometimes. Come on.
[1:04:30] We don't realize that they had to hide
[1:04:32] and do all kind of things just to say
[1:04:34] the Lord's prayer. Come on. Oh Jesus.
[1:04:38] But I thank God for the little grace
[1:04:40] that he's given us right now. Come on.
[1:04:42] I'm I'mma take the opportune of it.
[1:04:45] Hallelujah. Come on. I'm going to give
[1:04:46] it all I got right now. I was telling
[1:04:49] those boys that at work last night, I
[1:04:50] was stirred. I said, "What it is, this
[1:04:52] gospel is dripping with blood." Come on.
[1:04:55] You taking it for granted. You want to
[1:04:57] hear that word one day. You'll want to
[1:05:00] read it one day. Oh Jesus. Come on. Get
[1:05:03] it now. Hallelujah. Wow. It's It's a
[1:05:06] blessing to your heart. Come on. I don't
[1:05:09] know about you, but it's a blessing to
[1:05:10] my soul. See, if you don't believe in
[1:05:12] it, it can't bless you. Hallelujah. But
[1:05:15] but when you know it's real, it's more
[1:05:18] than just church services. But it's
[1:05:21] something real taking place. Something
[1:05:24] real moving in my soul. Something real
[1:05:27] speaking to my spirit.
[1:05:29] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. And it keeps me
[1:05:33] running. Hallelujah. Don't let nothing
[1:05:35] hinder you tonight. Amen. Glory to
[1:05:37] [Music]
[1:05:40] God. Hallelujah.
[1:05:54] Praise God. We thank God. Amen.
[1:05:59] You did run
[1:06:01] well. Amen. Who did hinder you? Amen.
[1:06:05] Praise God. I said he said it's
[1:06:07] impossible that offense would not come,
[1:06:09] but woe unto him that bring it.
[1:06:12] Amen. Praise God. We thank God. You
[1:06:16] know, the prophet God said a lot of
[1:06:19] times the devil will instigate. You have
[1:06:22] to put a little thought, a little spirit
[1:06:24] and and say this one don't like you or
[1:06:26] this no, you know. He said
[1:06:30] now and then next thing you
[1:06:33] know you'll find yourself being
[1:06:36] indifferent and not feeling good around
[1:06:38] a brother, sister. And he said that's
[1:06:41] just the devil.
[1:06:43] And then he says, "Now what you need to
[1:06:46] do is go to your brother or go to your
[1:06:48] sister when that little funny feeling
[1:06:50] get there. Go to them and talk." He
[1:06:53] said, "You'll find out nine out of 10
[1:06:56] times it ain't nothing but the devil."
[1:06:59] You know
[1:07:00] what folks usually do? They go to
[1:07:03] somebody else that's got the same
[1:07:05] spirit. Just like the prophet when he
[1:07:07] was seeing somebody got heart trouble
[1:07:10] there. He said, "I look over there. is c
[1:07:13] they crying out for one another. And all
[1:07:16] this time I was been pastoring sometime
[1:07:19] a person to come in church and uh if
[1:07:22] they got a problem in a certain area
[1:07:25] you'll find him themselves with that
[1:07:28] particular person they got the same
[1:07:29] problem. And I said those spirits cry
[1:07:32] out for help. They cry out if they got
[1:07:35] that problem then they get along just
[1:07:37] fine. And I I goodness I you know I be
[1:07:42] praying Lord don't boom they going to
[1:07:46] come together it takes prayer but if a
[1:07:48] person come in the in the church and
[1:07:51] they want God they want the Holy Ghost
[1:07:53] they want to see a move of God then they
[1:07:55] going to get with the people that want
[1:07:57] the same thing. Amen. They got uh God on
[1:08:01] their mind. People that got the same
[1:08:05] spirit. I mean, you nothing you can do
[1:08:08] but pray God. Yeah. Because you want
[1:08:10] them to get to God. But before they get
[1:08:13] to God in a in a deeper walk, in a
[1:08:16] deeper way, that spirit say, "Hey,
[1:08:20] what's your phone number? Hey, let's go
[1:08:22] out to eat. Hey, let's do this." Next
[1:08:25] thing you know, that's showing love. You
[1:08:27] know, are you with me? Next thing you
[1:08:30] know, they got a religious spirit
[1:08:32] instead of the Holy Spirit.
[1:08:35] Next thing you know, they Amen. They
[1:08:37] they got
[1:08:38] discernment. Oh, they got all all the
[1:08:41] the gifts of the spirit. They just moved
[1:08:44] on up. I said, "What they discerning?"
[1:08:49] That person that came
[1:08:51] in, you know, like a baby in Christ. And
[1:08:56] you know, a baby,
[1:08:57] Amen. It got to take some time to get
[1:09:00] matured. But before they can can get
[1:09:05] matured, that spirit sought them out in
[1:09:08] the area that their weakness is in.
[1:09:11] And that spirit sought them out and they
[1:09:14] got
[1:09:15] together. And you said, "What happened?"
[1:09:18] Then they see, you know, the bishop used
[1:09:21] to he told me one time and I I was
[1:09:25] having trouble with a certain
[1:09:27] bishop. And the reason why I had trouble
[1:09:30] with them because somebody had injected
[1:09:33] the this in my spirit and that and I
[1:09:37] said, you know, I'm just a young
[1:09:39] Christian. I'm challenging the
[1:09:41] bishop. You know, somebody been serving
[1:09:44] the
[1:09:45] Lord. But because somebody put something
[1:09:47] in my spirit, I'm going to be bold with
[1:09:50] it. You know what I'm saying? See,
[1:09:52] sometimes you don't know people can
[1:09:55] their spirit can get on you. And you can
[1:09:57] have a spirit against somebody just
[1:10:01] because somebody told you something
[1:10:02] about somebody, but that's somebody who
[1:10:04] told you, you got confidence in them.
[1:10:08] And you got so much confidence. You
[1:10:10] know, often times a a a pastor can see a
[1:10:13] lot of things, know a lot of things, but
[1:10:15] he can't say nothing. Cuz the minute he
[1:10:18] says something, he's gossiping.
[1:10:20] Are you with me? So a lot of times he
[1:10:23] said, "Oh, I wish I could tell you, but
[1:10:25] I can't." I wish I can tell you some
[1:10:28] things, but I can't. I just only thing
[1:10:31] you can do is pray. Because the minute
[1:10:34] you open your mouth and
[1:10:39] say, you're going to actually make the p
[1:10:42] make things
[1:10:44] worse than it is. So, you're going to
[1:10:47] have to let God work things out for you.
[1:10:51] Don't try to work it out yourself.
[1:10:54] If a person going in the wrong direction
[1:10:57] and you know that person has not is not
[1:11:01] your somebody has swed a seed against
[1:11:03] you in their spirit. Don't you go to
[1:11:07] them and say, "Brother, sister, so and
[1:11:09] so and so, you better pray because you
[1:11:12] can actually damage that person, hurt
[1:11:14] them." If you love that person, you just
[1:11:17] wait and see whether or not God will
[1:11:20] straighten it out. Just wait on God.
[1:11:22] Say, "Lord, I'm praying and I'm standing
[1:11:25] in the gap. You can even fast and pray
[1:11:27] for that sister, that brother." Amen.
[1:11:29] knowing that they have uh something but
[1:11:32] they they're innocent a lot of times
[1:11:34] because somebody sold the
[1:11:37] spirit against
[1:11:39] you to them and they actually don't know
[1:11:43] why they were acting contrary and you
[1:11:47] know I I got a little down the road in
[1:11:50] my Christian walk you know I said I
[1:11:53] didn't know I didn't know that that
[1:11:55] person matter of fact the person was
[1:11:57] actually advising ing me in the right
[1:12:00] direction and trying to tell me about
[1:12:04] spiritual things, what I need to be
[1:12:05] taken care of. But before I could get
[1:12:07] spiritual and before I can get the Holy
[1:12:10] Ghost, you know, I I'm all worked up
[1:12:13] like
[1:12:14] I I need God. I need help. I need the
[1:12:18] Holy Ghost. Are you with me? See,
[1:12:21] sometimes we need to work on us. Amen.
[1:12:26] We need to work on us as individuals
[1:12:28] instead of, you know, and people
[1:12:30] dropping loads and this on you and that
[1:12:33] on you, but I I need to work on me. I
[1:12:36] need help, God. I I need you now. I need
[1:12:40] more of God. I need I I need the spirit
[1:12:42] to move in my life, Lord. I want to know
[1:12:45] God. That's why I come to church for. I
[1:12:46] want to know God. I want to walk with
[1:12:48] God. I want to live for God. I want to
[1:12:50] work. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In
[1:12:54] the kingdom of God.
[1:12:56] Lord, I want to do something. What would
[1:12:59] you have me to do? And that's what it's
[1:13:01] all about,
[1:13:02] brother. Amen. You didn't come here to

[1:13:10] soul salvation with fear and trembling.

[1:13:21] is the 11th hour believers coming on in.

[1:13:27] what he's going to pay. Isn't that
[1:13:29] right? But you get in here and you work
[1:13:32] work out your soul salvation with fear
[1:13:34] and trembling. God bless you. Appreciate
[1:13:37] the word
[1:13:38] tonight. God is good.
[1:13:41] Amen. Don't come in here sitting down
[1:13:43] looking around. Come in here. Let's
[1:13:45] work. Amen. I wanted to know can tell me
[1:13:49] when God saved
[1:13:51] anybody and whenever he saved anybody
[1:13:54] you would read about Paul Saul on his
[1:13:56] way what would thou have me to
[1:13:59] do is me I'm a man of unclean lips when

[1:14:23] idol, a idol, what?
[1:14:27] Which
[1:14:30] scripture? But it sure been true. Isn't
[1:14:33] that right? A idol mind is the devil's
[1:14:36] what? Workshop.
[1:14:38] Workshop. That you got some sayings.
[1:14:41] Amen. But those sayings are pretty true.
[1:14:46] So, you can't be idle. You got to get to
[1:14:48] work. Amen. If you're not working in the
[1:14:51] in the in the kingdom of God, don't
[1:14:54] don't be here uh uh you know uh people

[1:16:10] conviction
[1:16:11] and normally you have you you ain't got
[1:16:14] no clothes for them. And he he said, "I

[1:16:19] you what, get baptized in the clothes
[1:16:22] you got
[1:16:24] on." And he was obedient cuz he it was
[1:16:27] time. Time was right. And he got
[1:16:30] baptized just like he was. You see what
[1:16:33] I'm saying? You know, when you when you

[1:16:52] What does hinder me from being baptized?
[1:16:54] And the unit and the Philip went down in
[1:16:57] the water. Are you with me? And you got
[1:17:01] to have that mindset. what I'm waiting
