[37:54] the midst Lord we thank you and we love
[37:56] you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[38:01] God is good amen we want to look at the
[38:04] book of
[38:06] second Corinthians
[38:08] by the grace of God
[38:11] oh it's First Corinthians 2
[38:20] .
[38:31] forgive me second Corinthians 11.
[38:34] I don't know how I got on mixed up
[38:36] second Corinthians 11.
[38:47] second Corinthians 11 and
[38:50] we'll begin at the first verse
[38:54] you got to say Amen
[38:56] and it reads what to God you you would
[39:00] bear with me a little in my Folly and
[39:02] indeed bear with me for I am jealous
[39:04] over you with a Godly jealous for I have
[39:06] espoused you to one husband that I might
[39:09] present you as a Chase virgin to Christ
[39:11] but I fear lest by any means as the
[39:14] serpent beguile Eve through this his
[39:16] subtility so your mind should be corrupt
[39:19] from the Simplicity that is in Christ
[39:21] for if he that cometh preaches another
[39:24] Jesus whom ye have not preached or if
[39:27] you receive another Spirit which ye have
[39:29] not received or another gospel which ye
[39:32] have not accepted you might well bear
[39:35] with him for I suppose I was not a wit
[39:39] behind the very chiefest Apostles may
[39:42] God have Bless The Arena of his word he
[39:43] may be seated
[39:45] I'm going to read a little further down
[39:48] says
[39:51] but but though I'd be rude in speech yet
[39:53] and not in knowledge but we have been
[39:56] thoroughly made manifest among you in
[39:58] all things have I committed an offense
[40:00] into basing myself that ye might be
[40:03] exalted because I have preached to you
[40:05] the gospel of God freely I robbed other
[40:07] churches taking wages of them to do you
[40:10] service and when I was present with you
[40:13] and wanted I was charged with no man for
[40:15] that which was lacking to me
[40:17] the brother in which came from Macedonia
[40:20] supplied and in all things I've kept
[40:22] myself from being burdison burdensen
[40:24] unto you and so will I keep myself will
[40:27] drop down to the 13th verse
[40:29] and it reads for such are false or Prof
[40:32] false Apostles deceitful workers
[40:35] transforming themselves into the
[40:38] Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for
[40:40] Satan himself is transformed into an
[40:44] angel of Light therefore there's no
[40:46] great thing if his ministers also be
[40:48] transformed as a Ministers of
[40:50] righteousness whose end shall be
[40:53] according to their Works God the
[40:56] blessing reading of his word again just
[40:58] for a quick moment it won't be long
[40:59] tonight I just want to just talk to you
[41:03] for a moment on and I entitle it ill
[41:05] filtration and disguises
[41:07] amen Hill filtration and disguises a
[41:11] little something I've been ministering
[41:13] on for the last couple of weeks and you
[41:15] know just kind of going over some things
[41:17] you know we're living in a hour of
[41:19] disguises
[41:21] we're living in an hour where you don't
[41:23] know what's real and what's fake
[41:26] because people got a way of disguising
[41:28] themselves right
[41:29] they can disguise themselves so much
[41:31] that a man can look just like a woman
[41:33] you don't even know the difference
[41:35] a woman look just like a man ain't it I
[41:39] remember me and uh Charlotte was that
[41:41] that McDonald's or somewhere one night
[41:43] and somebody walked by and and she said
[41:46] you know she looked and said that's a
[41:48] shame and I couldn't even tell it was a
[41:50] man
[41:51] it's that's scary ain't it
[41:53] but it's a way that they disguised
[41:55] themselves that's the hour that we're
[41:56] living in you don't know what's real and
[41:58] what's not you know and that's what you
[42:01] know I was thinking about you know we
[42:03] fighting the enemy that a lot of times
[42:05] you can't tell the enemy that you're
[42:07] fighting
[42:08] right that's why we need spiritual
[42:10] discernment
[42:12] more than anything a lot of times we try
[42:14] to discern things naturally but then we
[42:16] make a mess out of it don't it because I
[42:18] said you know I was thinking about it I
[42:20] said a lot of times what looks
[42:23] all the way right
[42:25] it might be wrong and what looks wrong
[42:27] could be right and all through the
[42:30] scriptures that's how that's how it was
[42:32] ain't it the things that didn't look
[42:33] like it was God it was God wasn't it
[42:36] I thought about John the Baptist a wild
[42:39] man coming out of the Wilderness right
[42:40] they're eating locusts and Wild Honey
[42:42] coming out there looked like he was
[42:44] crazy didn't it it didn't look right did
[42:47] it but it was right
[42:49] but then you might have seen uh Kai
[42:51] officer who all those in the in the in
[42:53] the robes and all that Whiteley robes
[42:56] and walking around doing it they look
[42:58] they're right didn't they come on but
[43:00] they were disguised but it's something
[43:02] about John the Baptist and Jesus they
[43:04] can look through those disguises and
[43:06] call them out for who they were right
[43:08] John I believe called them snakes and
[43:11] Vipers and all he says who who will warn
[43:14] you to flee the rap that's to come
[43:15] because even though you got a disguise I
[43:18] see exactly who you are and that's what
[43:20] God that's what the Holy Ghost is doing
[43:21] uh wants to do in our lives you know an
[43:24] hour that we live in you know we're
[43:26] fighting so many demon powers and some
[43:29] things look right but don't be right
[43:31] you know and they so sometimes a day so
[43:34] intellectual and things they come and
[43:36] they can make the make it sound so good
[43:38] right and then if you don't be careful
[43:41] you'll be deceived right along with
[43:42] everybody else
[43:43] because it looks right and even into
[43:46] intellectual mind it seems right but
[43:49] nevertheless it's something about the
[43:51] spirit of God you know we know that the
[43:54] word of God is powerful right it's quick
[43:56] it's sharper than any two-edged sword so
[43:59] what is the spirit what does the Holy
[44:00] Ghost in you he is the word he's going
[44:02] to produce the word he's going to be
[44:04] able to divide between the right and the
[44:05] wrong you might say it look right but
[44:08] something down on the inside of you the
[44:10] Holy Ghost is going to say it ain't
[44:11] right it's wrong
[44:13] it looks right but it ain't right
[44:15] and the thing is what he's doing that
[44:17] for he's keeping you from being deceived
[44:20] you know because in this hour of
[44:22] deception if it were possible it had
[44:24] deceive the very elect but God is
[44:27] keeping you and I from being deceived
[44:29] how by the Holy Ghost right and that's
[44:31] what it is you know the more that we're
[44:34] going on in this life and Christian
[44:36] Journey that's the more importance that
[44:39] you that you see that the need of the
[44:41] Holy Ghost
[44:42] because he's got to be the inside
[44:44] teacher
[44:46] you can hear the the man from behind the
[44:48] pulpit preaching and all but it may
[44:50] never get over but when the Holy Ghost
[44:52] comes he gonna teach you all things he
[44:55] gonna take the word and rightfully
[44:57] divide it and put it where it needs to
[44:58] be at and he's going to show you how to
[45:00] walk in it right and that's what it is
[45:03] so you know we find that it says
[45:05] infiltration and disguises you know made
[45:08] me think about a friend of mine Billy
[45:11] he fought in Vietnam and how he's saying
[45:13] the biggest problem was in Vietnam you
[45:16] didn't know who was who
[45:17] he says that you know they'd be out
[45:20] there mind sweeping for bombs and stuff
[45:22] and he says those children in the
[45:24] neighborhoods will be out there playing
[45:25] in the field running around people
[45:27] riding bikes all and they never got
[45:29] blowed up but the soldiers and all you
[45:32] know they're walking around they said it
[45:34] dawned on them one day that you know the
[45:36] reason why they ain't getting blowed up
[45:37] because they know where they're at
[45:39] they the ones planted them
[45:42] and then they you know the uh some of
[45:44] the Vietnamese was saying the problem
[45:46] with that war was you're looking for one
[45:49] bad guy and he said you might kill 10
[45:51] good guys before you get to a bad guy
[45:53] and by doing that now you don't turn a
[45:55] bunch of the good ones in the bad ones
[45:57] because you you done you killed the
[45:59] wrong so it was a mess because you
[46:01] didn't know who was who they couldn't
[46:03] discern who was who so it was like a
[46:05] battle you fighting you don't you can't
[46:06] see your enemy you're making a mess out
[46:08] of it right so I thought about that you
[46:11] know just uh spiritually speaking
[46:13] thinking about it and I says that and
[46:15] and all that we live in we we fighting
[46:17] and like I said you don't even know
[46:19] sometimes what you fighting right but we
[46:22] know that we ain't wrestling Flesh and
[46:24] Blood now
[46:25] we know that a lot of times the problems
[46:28] come out you know people get mad with
[46:30] each other in the church or the preacher
[46:32] and all of that you know but behind the
[46:34] scenes it's the devil the whole time
[46:36] coming in there stirring up stuff
[46:38] bringing out confusion that's his job to
[46:40] bring confusion right to keep you from
[46:43] getting on one Accord because he knows
[46:45] the power of what'll happen when you get
[46:46] on one Accord
[46:48] so his job is to keep confusion
[46:50] keep things stirred up right and then we
[46:53] looking at this and we we think say we
[46:56] know we're not fighting flesh and blood
[46:57] but you're not realizing that it's the
[46:59] devil the whole time you know it's when
[47:02] we can realize a lot of things the devil
[47:04] you know the devil can anoint somebody
[47:06] that's Holy Ghost feel
[47:09] they can say or do things they ain't
[47:11] knowing what they're doing and saying
[47:13] right
[47:15] that's hard to believe sometimes
[47:17] but the devil might take I said the
[47:19] devil anoint him but he'll take
[47:20] something that they said or done and
[47:22] take it and twist it before it get to
[47:25] you and when it get to you it'll mess
[47:27] you all up right but that's what the
[47:29] devil wanted to do but I say it's one
[47:32] thing about it no matter what in this
[47:34] life we got to keep love in our hearts
[47:37] no matter what
[47:39] you know I was thinking you know
[47:41] something that Russell Simmons was
[47:43] saying when he's talking to my sister
[47:44] about her um leaving on and he was
[47:48] telling her no matter what he said he
[47:49] got to get love on your mind
[47:51] everything else there ain't nothing else
[47:53] gonna matter he says cause you got to
[47:54] get love there's nothing short of
[47:56] perfect luck on enter in that place so
[47:58] that's what that's what's going on
[47:59] what's going to matter but the devil
[48:00] Gonna Keep Us away from that ain't you
[48:02] come on but infiltration in disguises I
[48:05] said that's what Paul uh was talking
[48:08] about here that you know he was afraid
[48:10] he was saying I sponsored one husband I
[48:13] preached the word you know to you I I
[48:16] gave it to him he says but I'm afraid
[48:18] for you he said that that just like
[48:21] Satan beguiled Eve he gonna beguile you
[48:24] you know Satan I say how did he beguiler
[48:28] he came in using the disguise didn't he
[48:30] he came in so like he says with
[48:33] septility he came in the devil ain't
[48:37] somebody say the devil Rush rough hard
[48:39] and ravish you that's what he gonna do
[48:42] when he get in there
[48:43] but the thing is from the beginning
[48:45] that's not how you get in there how he
[48:47] gets in how does he get in the home
[48:49] subtility
[48:50] how does he get in a a family a
[48:53] relationship so Tilly he eased his way
[48:55] on there and don't he
[48:57] and when he gets in there you know
[48:59] that's when he shows true colors you
[49:01] know thinking about you know how how
[49:03] Adam and Eve and and was in the garden
[49:06] and you know God made everything good it
[49:08] was living in we could say it was
[49:10] Paradise everything was beautiful right
[49:12] but Satan found a way to ease his way on
[49:15] in there didn't he he didn't come out
[49:17] showing you who he was from the
[49:19] beginning but he used a disguise
[49:21] he he came in uh in the serpent
[49:24] infiltrated didn't he that when he was
[49:27] there came talking to Eve she couldn't
[49:30] see uh past that disguise
[49:33] she couldn't see past that what he was
[49:36] hiding behind right but when he came in
[49:39] I said when the first thing when he came
[49:41] in the first thing he did was attack the
[49:43] word
[49:44] didn't he
[49:45] that's the first thing he did was to
[49:47] take the word because he knew that it
[49:50] that the word you she was fortified I
[49:53] would say today the devil know that you
[49:55] fortified behind the word right as long
[49:57] as you in the word come on like this you
[50:01] sang that song get in the word and stay
[50:03] there and be ready when Jesus comes come
[50:05] on not in the church but get in the word
[50:08] come on girl that's your hiding place a
[50:11] lot of times people think the church or
[50:13] their family friendships hide in place
[50:15] come on that ain't that ain't gonna
[50:16] rescue you a savior
[50:18] you got to know the Lord for yourself
[50:20] I was sharing with somebody that the
[50:22] other day I said no matter how good of
[50:24] your parents are no matter how good or
[50:27] or great works that they did you're
[50:29] gonna have to know to God for yourself
[50:31] I says you can go with them so far but
[50:33] when it comes down to going up to
[50:35] Calvary or going behind that Veil you're
[50:37] gonna have to go alone
[50:39] God gonna hold you accountable for your
[50:41] own works
[50:42] come on so what we do we search
[50:45] ourselves and say Lord you know do I
[50:47] have us out only these things but God
[50:49] I'm going to do what your perfect will
[50:50] is but that's what happened I would say
[50:52] Satan he came in didn't he infiltrate
[50:55] disguise Eve didn't know but the first
[50:57] thing he did he attacked the word right
[50:59] and got her all mixed up in her mind
[51:03] are all entangled confused now right to
[51:06] wait she started hearing things that was
[51:09] completely wrong but it sounded right
[51:11] didn't it
[51:12] sounded something that she can reason
[51:14] with
[51:15] right and then all of a sudden now she's
[51:18] beginning to believe what what was a lie
[51:21] you can believe it as a truth now
[51:23] because Satan came in
[51:25] right sometimes I say what we got to do
[51:28] is look at ourselves
[51:30] and see look at your Christian Journey
[51:33] your Christian walk you got to look at
[51:35] yourself
[51:35] and say God where am I at
[51:38] come on because what it is it like
[51:40] brother Jeremiah is preaching on the
[51:42] drifting because I was I thought that
[51:44] was the Lord because I ministered on
[51:46] that about three weeks ago uh just the
[51:48] same topic of drifting I said you don't
[51:50] know I was using an example about how
[51:53] once we were at the beach and had the
[51:56] little children with us and I was out
[51:58] there playing with them in the water and
[52:00] next thing you know when I look back I
[52:02] didn't realize how far we were out there
[52:05] but I realized every time the waves came
[52:08] in that little ruffling that you feel
[52:10] under the bottom of your feet
[52:12] it was it was the ocean pulling you on
[52:14] out though gradually you know dragging
[52:17] you you was drifting
[52:19] it didn't all come at once but under
[52:21] your feet it was something pulling you
[52:23] out there and you ain't even realize
[52:25] that you don't move that far out
[52:27] till you look back and you say man I'm a
[52:29] long ways away
[52:30] you say what we didn't know that but
[52:32] what it was it was a drifting that got
[52:34] you there come on SO and that's what it
[52:37] is the devil don't the devil don't just
[52:39] come like but it starts to little things
[52:41] right little the little thing the next
[52:45] thing you know you so far out there then
[52:46] you get confused
[52:49] come on
[52:50] you get confused you ain't been studying
[52:53] the Bible like you're supposed to
[52:54] you ain't been praying like you're
[52:55] supposed to so the more the more that
[52:58] happens he start injecting all kind of
[52:59] stuff in your spirit
[53:00] injecting all kind of stuff when you in
[53:03] your walk and then next thing you know
[53:04] you find yourself way out there confused
[53:07] the things you didn't you should do
[53:08] you're doing them now
[53:09] right but I say it's what it is that
[53:13] that's a call for each and every
[53:14] individual to check up themselves not
[53:17] parting the fingers nobody got the time
[53:19] to point the finger at nobody we all
[53:22] need eyes open we all need God to do
[53:25] something in our lives to help us stay
[53:27] the course because now the hour that we
[53:29] live in you know it can happen any
[53:31] moments anytime anything can happen at
[53:34] any time right so we need God to help us
[53:36] stay the course we need God I was
[53:39] looking at the something the other day
[53:40] where they said California had this big
[53:42] earthquake
[53:43] and people got hurt and stuff like that
[53:46] but I said you know what that was way
[53:48] down on the in the news article right
[53:51] but we hearing it so much and it don't
[53:54] even mean nothing now do it
[53:57] we're hearing it we even have an
[53:58] Earthquakes ourselves don't mean nothing
[54:00] to it
[54:01] because it's so common
[54:04] come on
[54:05] but the thing is one day the big one
[54:07] coming
[54:09] and it ain't gonna be there I want to
[54:10] get ready come on but you know he wants
[54:13] you to be ready
[54:14] when he comes I don't know about you but
[54:16] I want to be ready
[54:17] when the Lord comes when he called my
[54:20] name I don't want nothing to hold me
[54:21] down you talk with people sometimes and
[54:24] say you know you've been running this
[54:27] race for a long time you ain't got but a
[54:29] little while left a little mile to go
[54:31] come on even if you have 50 years that
[54:34] ain't but a little mile compared to
[54:36] Eternity right so stay the course amen
[54:39] but it says infiltration in disguises
[54:42] come on that's how the Devil comes in
[54:44] don't he Paul like we says he he says
[54:47] I'm fearing you know unless Satan
[54:49] beguile you didn't begin to talk about
[54:51] you know how I want you to be aware of
[54:54] false apostles and teachers and all this
[54:57] he says you know that even the devil
[54:59] Satan himself will show himself as an
[55:02] angel of Light right so if he does that
[55:05] then how much more of his ministers will
[55:08] do the same thing so he wanted to let
[55:10] you know that you know you got to be
[55:12] aware of these things aware of the
[55:15] disguises and the tricks and the schemes
[55:16] of the devil
[55:18] come on you got to be able to see see
[55:20] through it how are you going to be able
[55:21] to see through it by the Holy Ghost
[55:23] you know I was looking at uh one thing I
[55:26] was sharing with somebody I said you
[55:28] know
[55:29] what it is I said you know when you're
[55:31] born again
[55:33] uh you know we always talk about being
[55:35] born again now you're taking on the
[55:36] nature of God the genes of God and all
[55:39] that like that and the curse has been
[55:41] broken off your life you know
[55:42] generational curses and things like that
[55:45] so when the Holy Ghost comes in he he
[55:47] breaks all those curses and all so now
[55:49] you you on the you're on a good path now
[55:51] you're on the but I said even in all of
[55:54] that you still got you still got stuff
[55:56] you got to battle
[55:58] even in all that you still got demons
[56:00] you got to fight yeah yes you come into
[56:03] a place to where you know you're on the
[56:06] right path and God is taking over but
[56:08] you still got it's still stuff in you
[56:11] that's in your nature that you born with
[56:13] that's got to be held at Bay
[56:16] it's still people say oh no you get the
[56:18] Holy Ghost today but it is Paul says
[56:21] when I desire to do good
[56:23] he said what evil is present with me he
[56:26] talked about a war that he's fighting
[56:28] every day in his members right
[56:30] said I want to do right but it's
[56:33] something in me it's flesh this flesh
[56:35] shall never be redeemed come on but it's
[56:38] corrupt corrupt it ain't it Desiring the
[56:41] things of the world it's designed
[56:43] certain things but I say is what it is
[56:44] you know even though even though when
[56:48] you born again you still got about you
[56:50] still got things in there but what the
[56:52] Holy Ghost does he'll harness those
[56:54] things
[56:55] what the Holy Ghost does he keeps those
[56:57] things at Bay
[56:58] those things that you know you that
[57:01] tries to affect you somebody say your
[57:03] granddaddy was just where your mama was
[57:04] this way or whatever it might have been
[57:06] but you know what the Holy Ghost does he
[57:08] knows how to harness those things
[57:10] he knows how to harness them and keep
[57:13] you and walking in the right path right
[57:16] So I says that but what it is you got to
[57:18] let him have his way in your life you
[57:21] got to let him work people say this I
[57:24] always been like this when it's time for
[57:25] change
[57:28] it's time to change
[57:30] and let God like we always talk about
[57:32] you get married you know it's a lot of
[57:35] changes when you get married
[57:37] there's a lot of them somebody's oh you
[57:40] can't be the same You Gonna Change
[57:42] sooner or later right
[57:46] but change is good ain't it
[57:49] because God God gives you the right mate
[57:51] to help perfect you too
[57:53] I believe that what I say is that what
[57:55] it is you know but but we got to realize
[57:58] what the devil does right how he comes
[58:00] in how he disguised himself but look
[58:04] looking at looking at all he's saying
[58:05] let's say we didn't want to be long the
[58:07] reason why I always say the reason why
[58:10] history repeats itself because it's the
[58:12] same two Spirits fighting each other
[58:13] it's the same Powers right they just
[58:16] using different bodies now
[58:19] they got different disguises now because
[58:21] it just says Satan uses disguises God
[58:24] knows how to disguise himself too
[58:26] enclose himself and hide himself but you
[58:29] know what I'm saying like they need a
[58:31] body to work in
[58:32] come on y'all believe that tonight but
[58:35] to be able to to see it
[58:37] I believe that and I said that's what
[58:39] you know what we fighting or what we
[58:42] dealing with today you know
[58:44] I said God I want to be able to see you
[58:48] I want to I want to be able to see you
[58:50] God
[58:52] you know I said what happens a lot of
[58:55] times
[58:56] people
[58:58] when they can't
[58:59] when they don't see the word being
[59:01] produced in their life
[59:03] you know they'll talk about somebody
[59:05] else that the word is being revealed in
[59:07] their life or they'll Envy them they'll
[59:10] even go so far as sometimes they call it
[59:12] witchcraft for the devil
[59:15] you say they won't do it but they did
[59:17] Jesus that way didn't they
[59:19] what do they say they call him Beelzebub
[59:21] they say if he call them that what are
[59:23] they going to call you right because
[59:25] they didn't see the The Life of Christ
[59:28] uh being produced in their life but what
[59:31] I say is what it is you know if if the
[59:34] literal Life of Christ is in you it's
[59:38] got to be the supernatural
[59:41] you're a supernatural being looking
[59:44] for miracle signs and wonders
[59:46] looking for the inevitable the things to
[59:49] happen right it's a it's a yearning
[59:52] inside of you for more of God
[59:55] I need more of you come on because I
[59:59] know and that's what it is no matter no
[1:00:01] matter how
[1:00:03] the devil disguised himself or even God
[1:00:05] disguise himself their nature will be
[1:00:08] the same
[1:00:09] come on you know you'll know a tree by
[1:00:12] the way fruit it bear no matter what
[1:00:14] that nature will be the same right so
[1:00:17] when you say God in you the nature his
[1:00:20] nature Ain't Gonna Change he gonna be
[1:00:21] the same right come on God in Me Lord
[1:00:26] sometimes you say Lord where's the power
[1:00:29] come on not that you just want to show
[1:00:32] yourself high and mighty or Head and
[1:00:34] Shoulders above everybody else but the
[1:00:37] thing is you need it
[1:00:39] you need it right now
[1:00:42] you need it for healing
[1:00:44] salvation you know it's God's savior a
[1:00:47] lot a lot of situations you need it
[1:00:49] a lot of situations come up you need a
[1:00:52] miracle
[1:00:53] right
[1:00:54] and that's when you know you call out
[1:00:57] like like I believe it was getting said
[1:00:59] if God be with us then wear all his
[1:01:01] miracles at right come on when I say oh
[1:01:05] this that you you push it sometimes push
[1:01:07] things on the back side of the back
[1:01:09] burner but what it is that's the devil
[1:01:11] doing that you know why he does that he
[1:01:13] wants you to be cold and formal he wants
[1:01:16] you to be a regular Church going in
[1:01:17] Clapping Your Hands singing and going
[1:01:19] out no power come on
[1:01:21] professing the word but denying the
[1:01:23] power of he wants you to fall in that
[1:01:25] group but there is a group that won't
[1:01:28] just profess it
[1:01:29] and deny the power come on but they'll
[1:01:32] walk into power
[1:01:33] because they yield themselves to it and
[1:01:36] God did it work y'all believe that I
[1:01:39] always say God you know in our Christian
[1:01:41] Journey God always does things
[1:01:44] always
[1:01:46] does something and then sometimes you
[1:01:49] always say you go a little while
[1:01:50] but then God you cry out sometimes or
[1:01:53] something happened God does things to to
[1:01:56] let you know I'm still here
[1:01:57] I ain't going nowhere I'm still the same
[1:01:59] I'm still listening to you I'm still
[1:02:01] right here and what that does that even
[1:02:03] though in the darkest of nights when it
[1:02:06] seemed like you can't hear the voice of
[1:02:08] God your faith ain't shaken
[1:02:10] because you had experiences on the
[1:02:12] backside of the Wilderness somewhere
[1:02:13] like David now the line I Fought The
[1:02:16] Lion and the bear he just has one of
[1:02:19] those
[1:02:20] come on
[1:02:21] God has been too good to me too real to
[1:02:24] me
[1:02:24] that and all these things you know I was
[1:02:27] sharing the other day I said you know
[1:02:29] and we I know we hear it all the time
[1:02:31] but no matter what happens in your life
[1:02:34] remember the devil can't do no more than
[1:02:36] you than what God allowed
[1:02:38] he can't do no more
[1:02:40] I said I was sharing with the church the
[1:02:43] other day I said you know how I'm gonna
[1:02:44] start looking at these situations
[1:02:47] is God you working on me
[1:02:49] situations come say God you working on
[1:02:51] me come on pray for me now because God
[1:02:54] working on me
[1:02:55] I'm going through yes but God is working
[1:02:57] on me he said how can you say it like
[1:02:59] that because every trial a tribulation
[1:03:02] situation that I've been through
[1:03:04] it might have been hard some of them
[1:03:06] might have been hard but when you look
[1:03:07] back you start a hand to God in all of
[1:03:09] it come on when you came out even if it
[1:03:12] was a chastisement or whatever God
[1:03:14] brought you through you came out better
[1:03:16] than you was when you went in because
[1:03:18] God was working on you he wanted to show
[1:03:21] you some things about yourself that he
[1:03:23] wanted to iron out come on get it out of
[1:03:25] the way Hallelujah and we thank God for
[1:03:28] that for growth right thank God for
[1:03:31] growth because growth brings about it's
[1:03:34] a victory doesn't it growth brings about
[1:03:37] a stableness in your life
[1:03:39] that ain't where I used to be come on
[1:03:41] might not be where I want to be I'm
[1:03:43] still trying to obtain
[1:03:45] but I'm growing Hallelujah
[1:03:48] I'm stronger today than I was yesterday
[1:03:50] the things that battle me and and I've
[1:03:53] had to fight against I don't have to
[1:03:54] fight against him no more
[1:03:56] because God has given me the strength to
[1:03:58] defeat him
[1:03:59] and I ain't got to live like that
[1:04:00] Hallelujah but I'm going on to the
[1:04:03] deeper things in God I'm going on to a
[1:04:06] place to where a little bicker and Ark
[1:04:07] and all those things don't affect you
[1:04:09] but we moving higher in God
[1:04:11] to the place to where hey we got real
[1:04:13] demons and Devils to fight we heard
[1:04:16] about somebody said this somebody don't
[1:04:18] care about you all these other things
[1:04:19] come on we moving on to places
[1:04:23] to the climax
[1:04:24] of the battles Hallelujah oh Jesus come
[1:04:28] on y'all believe that tonight
[1:04:30] I don't want to be long as I said I'm
[1:04:32] going to run through it all but
[1:04:34] infiltration in Disguise see what the
[1:04:36] devil does like I said hey he comes in
[1:04:40] and he disguises himself right
[1:04:44] we get you all off course
[1:04:46] if it were possible to see the very
[1:04:48] elect
[1:04:49] says don't be surprised he's going to
[1:04:51] show himself as a as an angel of life
[1:04:54] and his ministers his his demons they're
[1:04:57] going to be Ministers of righteousness
[1:04:59] you know a lot of times the one that the
[1:05:02] things that look look right I mean the
[1:05:04] ones that be wrong they look like they
[1:05:06] got the most love don't they
[1:05:08] the one everybody they ain't living the
[1:05:11] life
[1:05:13] but they got more love than everybody
[1:05:16] come on
[1:05:18] but the one you know that rebuke you
[1:05:20] call you out whatever say he ain't got
[1:05:22] no love come on but the Life of Christ
[1:05:25] is in them
[1:05:26] he's backing you up because he loved you
[1:05:28] he don't want to see your loss
[1:05:31] come on sometimes
[1:05:33] you know you don't reckon with that but
[1:05:35] that's the truth you love it just like a
[1:05:38] parent love a child they chastise that
[1:05:40] child because they love that child they
[1:05:42] don't want to see them lost
[1:05:44] come on comes a time in our life
[1:05:47] Christian Journey
[1:05:48] come on where people sometimes be
[1:05:51] teeter-tottering in the spirit
[1:05:54] life and death spiritual death we might
[1:05:58] be getting ready to strike them and they
[1:06:00] don't want the truth come on they don't
[1:06:02] want to hear it
[1:06:04] but God sends it anyway don't he the
[1:06:07] people don't want the truth but God's
[1:06:08] gonna send it anyway I thank God that he
[1:06:11] sent it come on because you know what it
[1:06:13] saved me one day it picked me up let me
