appreciate you thank you for all that you've done in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] amen we want to look at the book of hebrews by god's grace hebrews 12. hebrews 12 and we'll begin at the first verse [Music] you gotta say man i gotta get it myself hebrews 12 and one it reads wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does easily so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us you may be seated he said run with patience the race that set before you you know i want to read a little further down says looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endure such condition of sinners against himself lest ye be weary and feign in your minds ye have not resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten exhortation which speaketh unto you as to children my son despise not the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord love he chasteneth and discourages every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening god deals with you with with you as with sons for for what son is the whom the father chasing is not but if you be without chastisement where of all are partakers then ye are what and not sons amen furthermore we have had our we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much more rather be in the subjection unto the father of spirits and live for for their for they verily for a few days chastened us for their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now the chaz chastening from the present for the present seemed present seemed to be joyous no chase now no chastening from the presence seemed to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yielded the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised by thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees make straight to pass for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed amen tonight by god's grace i just want to minister to you for a short moment and i entitled it what a good father a good father and what it takes to grow amen a good father and what it takes to grow you know we can look at many things in the scripture i like how he says that here you know let us run with patience the race that is set before you i know a lot of times we want everything quick fast we want to hurry up and get done but he says i want you to run this race with patience i want you to take your time come on it's going to be a lot of things you know in a way a lot of things coming because god is no matter what's taking place in our lives you know we got to come to the to the understanding that god is doing something he's working something out i told my my grandmother a while back i said you know she was having her little time faced with some things and i said you know you might be 80 something years old but god ain't done with you yet i say your work ain't finished because if your work was finished then you would have no need to you know be here but the lord got you here because your work ain't finished so sometimes we we want to hurry up the race as we say it but you know he says with patience i want you to take this race and whatever god the things that that come a lot of times situations don't have to be as bad as as what they are in our life it's just how we look at those situations they don't even have to be that bad but we have to change i believe that sometimes in the way we we're thinking the way we're looking at it and that no matter what comes my way i'm gonna i'm gonna get something out of it i'm gonna find i'm gonna find growth in what i'm going through i'm gonna find i'm gonna find i'm gonna gain something and what the lord has taken me through so where i'm where i'm at right now i'm not worried about where i'm at right now like to say i know where i'm at i'm not worried about it come on and i was praying last night and i said you know it comes some things happen in our life but the lord he don't show us every road that's before us he don't show us the way i said sometimes look like we're moving we don't know where we at we don't know i mean which road to take god don't show us every road but i i was praying to myself and it came to me that when the lord put you at a certain place your testimony will will it always be i'll bless the lord he said bless the lord at all times his praise shall what continually be in my mouth so i i was praying i could see myself you know it's look like you had a place and you don't know the direction where you got to go but i said in that place i'm still gonna bless the lord i'm gonna still trust you god because just as a sheep need a shepherd lord you are my shepherd i'm not leading myself i want you to leave me and wherever you lead me i'll follow whatever situation you know you find yourself in like i said lord i'm gonna grow out of this situation i'm gonna find i'm gonna find what are you what do you want me to learn in this place what are you trying to teach me because remember the holy ghost is the teacher he come to teach you all things you know just as i always say you had to learn when you were born how to operate in this world you had to learn how to walk you had to learn how to hold things you had to learn how to even some simple things that we take for granted you take your spoon and you just pick up and eat but you one day had to learn how to do that you had to learn how to use a fork you had to learn certain things in the natural life and it was most of the time taught by our parents or sometimes you had older siblings or things or some things you just knew how to do by instinct but just as you we had to learn how to function how to operate what was what in the natural realm the same way the holy ghost has to teach us on the spiritual side how to operate that why you say run this race with patience being born again you didn't come out you don't come out the womb running but you got to learn you learn you crawl you know you have to learn how to crawl you imagine that as a baby babies have to learn how to crawl they don't even know how to crawl they have to learn how to crawl then they have to learn how to sit up they have to learn you know there's certain things that they have to learn they their muscles got to get stronger for them to do things come on it's and what it is they they growing into that place and just as those things after a while you take it for granted but you were in the learning process one day you had to learn those things then as time go on you learn a lot of other key things in life some things only come with age and time you want to be there but you got to learn you have to learn those things but i said all that in the natural because we're looking at it from a spiritual sense no like i said the holy ghost is the teacher he come to teach you all things he wants to teach you how to operate in the realm of faith he wants to teach you how to excel with nothing come on how to make like they say how you make something out of nothing he want to teach you that and how are you going to do that by faith he want to teach you how to walk on water come on he says you say to the mountain be thou remover to be cast to see god want to teach you how to operate in realms that you don't know nothing about come on but it's all in the learning process how many believe that tonight so he says that you know a good father and what it takes to grow i said it's something god we know he he has attributes that he want he wanted to express from the beginning of time he had things in him that he wanted to express to us to show him to show us who he who he is and that you know a lot of times you look for something people are looking for things but he is what you're looking for he's got what you're looking for how many believe that so we find i says that you know he's got attributes and one of the things on an attribute i want to dwell on tonight by god's grace says he is a father not only is he a father but he's a good father come on many times we forget that part about it we see him as being god the master come on but but he's a father he wants to he and he wants to show you you know uh what a what a good father is you know a lot of times uh we as those that have children can we we consider ourselves to be parents fathers and stuff but he he wants to show us what a good father is he wants to you know and that's god god god cares about that yo yo yo daily principles in life come on he just don't want you just to be any kind of way but god wants to work on you with daily principles god wants to work on you from every wit to be or to become what he desired or what he see in his mind of you i thank the lord tonight but i said i want to deal with that sometimes we forget that that that god is is a father but you know i says that you know looking here he talks about how he says in the ninth verse he says furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much more be under subjection to the father of spirits a lot of times you know we have to uh i believe examine how we treating god you say okay how you treat god a lot of times you look at how you're dealing with the ministry remember the man of god is he's god's mouthpiece he's god gives him a word he's using that man to speak through you so it's not that that man is trying to establish dominance over you in that way but what it is god is delivering to you what he desires what he wants uh with the word so we we see that you know it we like he said you give your natural father's reverence how much more when they corrected you he dealt with that correction when they corrected you you gave them reverence come on you try to a good child try to please their parent try to please their father or whatever dude to do what whatever they think will be pleasing in sight so to do that he said how much more are not we to have reverence for the father of all spirits for the how much more if you want to please your natural parents would you want to please god just so much more god is god is so good i said lord that's what it is we we got to start i believe that by the grace of god uh looking at looking at it in a little different from a look i've been looking at it in a little different aspect i said you know what it is god knows like we said a good father he knows what it takes for us to grow he knows just just what to do i was thinking about sometimes you and i was staring at sunday we could see these mighty trees sometimes mighty oak trees and or whatever it might be i just use the oak tree but we see them standing tall some of them 50 100 years old and and we might marvel at the at the statue of the presence of that tree but we never one time took in account or come to in our mind to to uh to understanding or even think about what did it take for that tree to get to where to the point to where it's at now what did it take you know for that tree to become that statue i says that you know if trees could talk maybe they'll tell you about some cold winters they had to endure maybe they'll tell you about some storms that they've been through and all these things but nevertheless all of that was the makeup of what they became and you know i said too much anything or kill you you know and god knows that's what you know even for growth too much anything will kill you but it takes a mixture a mixture of sunlight a mixture of water too much water achilles too much sunlight to kill it too much just so it takes a mixture of things to for that for that tree or for that or whatever we're dealing with to grow it take some mixture and sometimes you know we don't want to uh uh um receive uh the mixture of things that god is putting on us in our life but he knows what it takes for us to grow a lot of times i was saying on the other day it's a price that you pay for the anointing it's a price you pay come on it's not that he says that in one place if the many man will follow me let him first deny himself is what he says come on it's hard to deny yourself it's hard to deny yourself forget about you it's hard to forget about you because well we a lot of times we think about ourselves and we want to excel but he says if any man come after me got to first do what he got to deny himself deny himself not only he's asking you to deny yourself but he says but i want you to pick up your cross come on and follow me god is going to do something with you but the first thing he asks you to do is deny yourself then when you deny yourself i want you to carry your cross come on i like how you told paul and one place he says uh i'ma he says he's so told um uh not cornelius but anyway he's told him he says i'ma show him all that he got to shuffle for my namesake come on i'ma show him what he what he's got to suffer so god knows like i said is what it takes you know uh for us to grow a lot of times like we're saying too much anything or kill it but a lot of times it takes depth to grow it takes depth takes you dying come on it's not not looking so much as a naturally but it takes you dying spiritually you know we forget about that sometimes in the in the journey we get relaxed so god throw things your way so you have to get back down on your knees again and die get back down on your knees again you know we look at though like it says those mighty trees you can ask them or see what they've been through it took yeah they went through the spring they went through time of life they went through time of rejoicing but they also have to go through a time of death every year every year they gotta die come on you say the tree did it die no well it look might look like it died but it was still life somewhere down in the roots but god does those things sometimes as the scripture says he purges it come on that he can make a new a more abundance to come forth god's got to purge come on and i thank the lord you know just because we know like he says here in the scriptures that uh the suffering a lot all the chastisement at the time don't seem to be pleasurous or joyous he says but the end fruit of it it the end is going to bring what it's going to be a glorious end to it it's going to be a fruitful end to it if we can make it through that part then it's going to be a fruitful end to it and i thought about that by the grace of god i says what it god being a good father and what it takes to grow god knows like it says uh uh how to how to get us where we need to be at in life you know i think about he says the isaiah said that the year that king azad died i saw the lord come on it took it took god moving things out of his way in order for him to grow you know we we got to understand what what that it ain't it ain't in us but it's in what god is doing come on moving thing god is allowing things to transpire move for what for you to grow you know one thing happens one thing god is a good teacher he ain't one of those teachers that just gonna allow you he know that you ain't understanding the problem or you ain't understanding the test but he gonna just let you slide by but god will fail you he'll fail you because what he wants you to take that test all over again god allow that test to come back come on he is not one of these like he says bad bad teachers or bad followers that's just going to say okay that's all right we'll let you back and you and you didn't get nothing you didn't gain nothing come on but you might have just by memory pass god ain't like that but god wants to see that you grab something out of the equation you grab something out of the situation then what it's time to move on to the next test so we find lord why am i here again look like i'm routing circles look like i've come back to the same place come on the teacher no you ain't quite got it yet the teacher know that it's something that he wants to he he wants the revelation we'll use that word he wants a revelation to click down in your soul he wants something to happen on the inside that you say oh i got it now come on then he anything when it comes your way you got it it clicked it's like second nature to you come on hallelujah how many believe that tonight but i said that's what he does he does that to each and every one of us and you know looking at it i says you know him him being a good father i like how i already said and i say it again you know bill gates made a statement once so people was was was ragging on him and saying that you know all the billions you got says that you're going to take all those billions you and your wife and put it in charity come on and he said he's give you going to give his children at one point only a million dollars a piece come on then they said i'll give them a 10 million dollars a piece some of us wish we had that now but he had he had he got billions that he would give him but they asked him why wouldn't he give it to him he said because if i gave it to him it would destroy them he said they would never develop their own character they'll never find themselves in life he said so he'll do what he can do to help them find themselves in lives not give them something that could potentially destroy them because he was more interested he's more interested in them building character them developing something that could be a beneficiary to the world and others than them giving something giving them something that would destroy them and he began to talk about certain you know individuals and look at what you know the money did to him look at what this did to him it destroyed him you know but listening to that it always something always stuck to me because i said you know even as natural fathers can can see certain situations and and have wisdom on that aspect how much more does god have wisdom on that because because not only that god he sees the beginning but he knows what the end of the story gonna be like he knows it a lot of times we cry we ask for things not knowing but god knows that if he give it to you it'll kill you he know it'll destroy you so what he does as a good father and we can't understand sometimes others might talk and say well why y'all dad this and why you did come on but nevertheless he's a good father he understands that if he give it to you it'll destroy you it'll kill you so he allows us to go through that that trial go through that because he says i want to build character in you i want you i want something in you to develop that won't just be a prophet to you and those around you but that will have an effect on the whole world hallelujah and that's what god wants us to to extend from just amongst your family extend from just amongst your household but god wants to release something in you that'll be a benefit to the whole world then when people see you they'll say ain't these the one that turned the whole world upside down everywhere you go you can be a blessing to somebody else hallelujah you know i was thinking about today on the job and i said you know you look at the out the path that god brought you down you look at where god brought you from sometimes you embarrassed of it sometimes you ashamed but nevertheless i learned to reach back into that place and grab uh uh trophies out of there hallelujah cause i can see i was here hallelujah but now god has picked me up and placed me here i was there once but look at what god did you know i was thinking about that today i said i was on the job and just talking with uh somebody from corporate and you know i said like he was talking to me about he wanted to have a one-on-one talk when we had to talk and you know and i could see certain things he was saying and you know he was going on and talking and and then he says man i don't i don't he cuz i told him i said you know he was talking about certain positions at the job and i said you know my thing is you know i i love to be in church you know i said i love to be in the house of god i said because i said some people they they can say they're saved be christians you know but it don't matter to them whether they come to church or not don't matter to them whether they read their bible or pray or not come on i says but i'm just a little different i said because i said the way he brought me from i said if you only understand or only know what the lord has done for me i said then then you would you would know why i said maybe sometime we get another time i'm gonna sit down and i want to tell you where god brought me from i want to tell you that right now nothing don't mean nothing uh uh i can gain the whole world but lose my soul i said but you can have the whole world but give me jesus hallelujah that's all that matters in the morning when i rise give me jesus when i lay down at night give me jesus cause he is the one that brought me to where i am right now and i'm out here waiting on him to continue to lead me on the rest of the way hallelujah oh jesus you know i'm just sharing with you and then he says he said i want to show you something ernest i don't show nobody he pulled uh uh his card out he ordained minister he said i'm an ordained minister and pulled his card out i said okay and he says you know he says man he said you know just talking about going to church he says he and just like that he said oh he says you know mike the supervisor no i mean maintenance manager he said yeah he told me you love to go to church he said but he asked a question what if everybody want to go to church i said you know i said well that would be a good thing if everybody wanted to go to church but he began to say he began to say uh yes he said i don't mind you going to church he said but can you come to work at the church come on i said you know the lord is good anyhow amen but i said you know a good father and what it takes to grow god knows i believe that what it takes for you to grow and like i said he he he does things you know sometimes you say he withhold things or whatever but i'm learning we always a lot of times in our mind i mean or in our spirit we're on the asking part lord would you give me this lord would you do that lord would you do this come on but instead i says lord instead of in our mind always be on the asking side i want to say lord what would you have of me time is short come on they say time is winding up time down wound up and if the lord should tarry still yet time is short what what would you do with the look with the time that god has given you god i want to say that lord i gave you all lord i gave you everything every wit every being my mind my whole body soul was subjected of uh uh uh under subjection lord to you to give you all all what you uh have out of my life i don't know about you but i said i want god to use me up hallelujah i was sharing with the church and something that i was saying the thing is you know we always struggling or battling to get back to we want god to be who he was at where what who he was but we got to get back to what we what we used to be we got to get back to that place you know that desperate cry that you cried when you were in trouble that desperate cry when you were in a hole somewhere and looked like that you might die in the morning and yet you cried out so desperate that god and god heard that cry that cry that you cried then it moved him come on that cry moved god that said sometimes we got to get back to that crowd that moved god that cry that makes him get up off his throne that cry that makes him stand up and let all our enemies be scattered that cry that he hear a young one say i got to come to his rescue i said lord get us back to that cry lord hallelujah and a lot of times it takes desperation to get us back to that place and i don't know about you but i said sometimes you know with the with the way things are happening and trans and transpire here now even so quickly it out just it ought to shake you it ought to cause you to stir come on the time go on you know i looked at i said they they dying left and right come on trouble is hitting left and right things are and everything that can be shaken is shaken right now but nevertheless i says that we we lord right now are needy people god we need your help we need your anointing we need the double portion we need the fire come on again in our life the drought has about killed us all lord we need you to send the rain again think about elijah three and a half years no rain the people were dying come on the grounds was dried up hallelujah but it came a time that god was going to send rain again came a time where he says if your god be god and let them answer by fire lord we need to reign again come on the drought is everywhere it's hidden it's taking folks out killing sometimes churches at the time lord we need to reign again the enemy has come in and and swept through come on i was thinking about the great robbery come on the devil has come rob the church of their blessings robbed in search of the spirit the true baptism of the holy ghost like they had it in the book of acts one that they can stand up and say that this is that hallelujah we need that today you say how why it's not just for a show but we need it people are dying people are sick people are losing everything including their minds hallelujah but it's going to take god to hold us together it's going to take his spirit i believe that coming down giving us a refreshing again a refreshing to get our mind off of the world get our mind from being relaxed hallelujah give us a refreshing to pick us up and carry us into those heavenly places so where we can sit down and hear god's voice again i don't know about you i said lord but we long to hear your voice we long to see your spirit we long to see you do something again in our lives how many want that tonight but a good father come on he knows what it takes for us to grow he knows what it takes to get us to get us to that place you know i want to say some other things and you know just to dwell on it on that on that good father you know i said sometimes you know he knows and i can't i can't get there i said he but he knows what it takes you know i thought about joseph and how what he went through to get where he got but look at the character that he developed through that it took him going through those things to become who he was and even in that he realized looking back that he could tell his brothers you know as we were saying that here in the scriptures how it says no chastisement at the present time seems yours but the end of it it's going to bring peace if you would endure or you hold out it's going to bring a fruitful end and i could see joseph telling his brothers you didn't uh uh do it you didn't do it you had nothing it was god that done it god sent me here that come on like it says not to to just be something about himself but that he can be a blessing to others it was god that sent me here come on and now he realizing it took him it took him down that road he went through some things they get where he was at but the father knew what it take because he nevertheless you know joseph was going to be a ruler joseph was going to be in a position to rule but god knew what what to do to get him to that position that where when he got in that position to rule come on power without character he said satanic but power with characters fit the rule god knows what it took to get him there and sometimes when we think we're ready god no we still ain't ready he still takes us and carries makes us and moses into the place to where he says now i'm gonna put you in charge how many believe that tonight and it still won't be you because you are always in subject to the under subjection to the father you're always looking for his guidance you always looking for his leadership in him to be the rule of your life how many want that tonight i said a good father amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise praise the lord amen we thank the lord for the word tonight we appreciate it appreciate the word amen god is good love the lord you heard my cry amen great greetings from saints down in mullins say praise you we had a wonderful service down there the thanks seem to be really stirred in the lord and appreciate brother gordon and saints carrying on up here we certainly appreciate that we kind of took some of the musicians and everything and when i looked at the service and y'all made it through thank the lord god bless y'all amen we just thank god for if we're faithful to him that's what makes the difference amen when it's all said and done how faithful are we to him it's not how faithful we are to ourselves but how faithful are we to god amen sometimes i just saying lord you're so faithful to me but how faithful are we to him that's another thing and i tell you it's the little things that we do for god that makes the difference and it's the little things that we don't do that's going to make the difference it's not it won't be this great big thing amen the reason why some folks said lord lord then i do many wonderful works in your name cast out devils i did all this he said depart from me your work was of iniquity it could have been that little small person that you thought was insufficient that you thought was nothing and you just looked over that one and it could have been that you know little thing that god said spoke to your heart said i want you to do this and you say well that's too it's too small for me sometimes it's the little things as he said the little foxes spoiler blind vine and it's a little level that leaven the whole lump it's the little things that god is going to ex require of us it's not the big things amen it's just like name a name i wanted to you know why you're going to ask me to dip in more than muddy jordan it's the little things in our lives that god is going to require just being faithful to him just being faithful to god not to man but to god i think we get it mixed up sometimes we think what we do we're doing it for the church we're doing it for the pastor we're doing it for a man but we don't know what we do we're doing it for god and when we do it for god and we're faithful to him then god will reward you because you're doing it as unto the lord and it's another thing is i listened to him you know i thought about the pain [Music] that i was having just to walk and then a lot of times i took the stick the cane and my wife went and bought me a cane and i was you know in so much severe pain i thought about it's a blessing to be able to walk up here and not be in pain and i thought about uh today when i was taking the blood pressure and i can see you know 120 something over 77 i says you know i didn't take the blood pressure medicine and and i said thank the lord i didn't take it a couple days you know and i'm still seeing you know the you know no pressure god is good and i said well i'm not telling you don't take your medicine but a lot of times god god can do what he want to do if you trust him and you believe in him then you let god do what he does well and i said it's just a privilege i'm so inspired i'm so happy because i know within myself there's no way that i know what to do when it comes down to leadership guidance it's no way that if i get in myself for two minutes we probably have two people left see what i'm saying but if i let god handle things he knows what's best for each and every one of us and that's why it takes pride it takes god moving in our lives and i pray god you move in each and every one of your children's life each and every home each and every family god you move in at home you move in their life if you don't make changes in our lives amen there's no use you know somebody said well i'll do what you say no do what the spirit says do what god says if you do it for man then you'll start doing it but if you do it for god and you make changes that go for god and you know your relationship is with the father not amen not with man with the father your relationship was with the father god amen and that's what i i was talking to somebody i said you know it's very real that people can get all i think brother david in something i said people can get all the knowledge all the mysteries and then with all the mistress they they they have no relationship personal relationship with god and don't know if it's god it's god in them they're not saved they don't know what it means to talk to god and to listen to god talk back to them they have no relationship with god and i i you know to have a relationship with god that means your your life began to be conformed to his image you begin to walk like god talk like god you begin to amen nobody somebody can say well i know that person is saved i know that person people if if you hadn't heard it lately it's something special about you it's something different about you if nobody tells you that constantly but you have to tell people i am saved you know what i'm saying don't say nothing just go on your job work hard don't even talk about the lord just just be godly and watch what people do if you your light is shining you'll find people say something is different about you you say what yeah something's different then you got your chance are you with me but if you got to you know i want to tell you you need to be safe you need to do this you need to do that no no no no no you need to be quiet and pray for that person and the person that's doing the the that's persecuting you and doing the worst things that on the job they really just tearing you down that person is perfecting you are you with me i was going to preach a message promotion you know when um shadrach and meshach and abednego got promoted after they went in the fire then the king said we're going to promote them are you whooping now what you do you mess with your promotion when you think somebody's throwing you in the fire and you respond and react in the wrong way amen you lose the victory and you're not promoted because you did not pass the test isn't that right but when they went through after they went in the fire the king said it's time for what y'all to be promoted look at joseph everything he went through but it was taking him to what promotion amen and that's what god want to do he wants to promote you maybe maybe i'll talk about it suddenly if you're ready to be promoted amen then it's a way that god's going to test and prove you and see whether or not amen you're fit to rule amen god bless you today appreciate the word thank you brother ernest god bless you today amen let us stand i'ma tell you when you think people are doing you wrong y'all hear me when you think people are doing you wrong then i'm saying it's good for you because you're getting ready to be what promote it isn't that right so don't you complain when they do you wrong but you'll be happy isn't that right but if you're complaining amen and you are being all out of they doing me wrong they doing me wrong it's god that's doing you wrong because god is taking you through your test god is taking you under to your trial and he's trying to promote you but you don't want your promotion because you said i ain't taking it no more i'm tired of taking it i'm tired of going through some folk will leave home they'll leave their family they'll leave their wife they'll leave their husband they'll leave every their children and everything why because they get tired sometimes are you look man i know i'm talking to somebody that's all right but see sometimes something tell you say this for somebody are you with me i had to say amen y'all know the holy ghost is so good until he know what we'll be going through he's so good amen praise god stand still and let god handle business are you with me stop trying to do it on your own start praising the lord because you said god things are going to change now because i'm understanding amen praise god let us father we thank you today thank you for your word lord we thank you because god you're good anyhow it doesn't matter how difficult things look and how different things difficult things are god i just pray that your blessings will just oh god be pulled out on your children father help us oh god to accept

somebody would say god forgive me father i yield lord i know you're speaking to me you want me to receive testimony and i haven't been receiving chastisement properly lord when you just hired me i said somebody doing me wrong but lord our brother ernie's a sign to us tonight let's be sons and daughters of god father help us now bless this people lord your sons and daughters father to receive
