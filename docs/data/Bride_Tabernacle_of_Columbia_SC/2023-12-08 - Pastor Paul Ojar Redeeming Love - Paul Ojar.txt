testifying God bless you all I'm so happy to be here tonight the Lord brought us save the devil tried but the Lord was with us and I stand here as a testimony that God is alive we serve a real God we've been traveling since about 8 months ago we went to Mexico we went to Africa twice the Congo we just came back from India about 2 weeks ago we went to South Africa and I've seen so many things that the Lord did and I just want to say that God is real I have so many testimonies but I'll just give a few because I know Paul has to preach thank you Lord there was a young girl in South Africa when I went there we had a prayer line and the the mother asked sister Hannah can you pray for my daughter and she came but I knew something was wrong with the daughter before that the mother came and uh she said my daughter was in drugs for the past s years and she's behind bars now she breaks up everything in the house and this mother cried like a baby and I felt like it was my own child I was praying for she said she's behind bar she kind of Tink properly she can't talk she's lost her mind and she's going down the road of this instructions only in drugs she was on for 7 years and there was no hope for her and I said holy spirit I'm sending you to the hospital now to deliver that child she was 20 she's 22 years old I'm sorry I'm crying but I've seen God so real I give myself away to Jesus my life is is in his hand and I said Lord whatever you want to do with this piece of clay just do it Lord and after prayer oh I just cried out to the Lord I said Lord I'm just sending you there to touch that dear child of us and two days after I I was home in the hotel and I was praying I said holy SP the mother called and I'm praying and I said Lord today is the day of Deliverance for that child and while I was praying the mother's I have all the text I have all the voicemail on my phone the mother's crying she said sister Hannah sister Hana the doctor just dis discharged my daughter she's perfect her mind is back to normal she said only God can do that I said yes I told you it and you just got to hope and believe because he's real she came out of the hospital I think it was 2 or 3 days after totally healed she went to church and she gave her heart to the Lord she was baptized what a mighty God we serve this child mind was totally messed up and the Lord Jesus came on the scene and touched her she's serving the lord today oh I just thank the Lord he's so real there was had a baby in the Congo after service there was a prayer line and the pillow of fire came in the church five places and they took pictures of the pillar of fire while we were praying for the sick people that night 25 people got healed instantly in the church and there was a lady brought a a baby who was crippled and after prayer the do the lady said there was no hope for this child absolutely no hope and instantly the child start getting better and better and better and the mother was so happy and the the news just went through the Congo and people are just texting and asking for prayer because they see a miracle in front of their eyes so many things happened at that church that night and after service the Pastor said can you all go to the hospital his baby was critical a two we old baby she was so tiny she was this small and there were tubes all over the body and she was in intensive care and the doctors didn't want to let me in because the baby was critical and the father begged he was the pastor of church and he begged and he begged and he begged and the doctor said okay bring the pastor in so when the doctor saw me he said she's a pastor he said no no no she's just a sister she came to pray and there was a glass because I couldn't go in the room and there was a glass between us and like the baby was laying right there and there was tubes all over this baby and I said Satan you're such a wimp to attack a little baby like that why don't you get your match and I said and I saw the de Angel there because the baby had a terrible blood disease there was no cure for this tender little baby and my heart went out to that baby and I said father I'm just asking you to heal this baby tonight I can't touch her but I know that you hear prayer and you answer prayer and I left the hospital just a minute or two I just prayed very simple prayer in my heart and I went home and I laying in the bed and said Lord could you send that baby home in the morning to that mother because I met the mother outside and she was so broken but their language barrier and I just hug her and I give her a thumbs up I said all is well well so I told the father I said all is well and 2:00 in the morning I'm praying I said Lord only one thing I'm asking you I want that baby home tomorrow morning on church I stand Here a testimony I have the baby in my picture and my phone the next day that that the mother slept in the hospital and they discharged the baby the blood was perfect the blood and the baby was just perfect every tube came on that baby and that dead Angel left and the child is perfectly whole there was another testimony this sister when we were in the Congo the last trip they had a long prayer line and they asked no after I was praying I was walking out of church and I was so weak I said Lord I just want a little strength to go in the car and I saw young girl sitting in the chair there lined up for praying her whole leg was broken they cut the leg so many times to put it together and no doctors could put the legs together she was in a bad accident it was broken to pieces and I nailed up before that child I remember my daughter Zoe I said Lord she's like my baby Lord Jesus and I just want you to put the leg back together every bone because you had a greatest surgeon there is Dr Jesus I'm calling you on the scene now you made this body so perfect and I know I know that you can put it back together now church I was SCS all over that child's leg the pastor text me he said sister Hannah she couldn't walk on her own she had to use crutches he said Rebecca is walking normal no more crutches everything is perfectly whole I thank the Lord Dr Jesus came on the scene and touched that the bones and put every bone back together we went to India a few weeks ago there was another sister the holy spirit said get up and go downstairs and while I was walking through the church I saw a girl all her face was scarred and I said I asked the girl what's wrong with her because of the language barrier they said every time she's cooking she falls into the fire and her whole face is burnt up I said Satan Jesus going to get you today oh I prayed for that child and she was perfectly whole she had she epileptic demon was always attacking her and I know my Prophet said that's a hard demon to deal with but nothing is too hard for God and that I left that girl perfectly hold and there's the last testimony while we were going to India we left we went to Miami to get the plane and while at the ticket counter they said you can't go to India we said why they said where are your Visa we said we have no visa she said we can't go on this plane and I said but we could so I called a brother in India I said brother they said we can't come so I said David go check to the supervisor to see what's going on she said you all have to buy a new ticket and go to Dubai and see if you get the visa in Dubai but all the meetings were already planned and we said Lord I know when the enemy when you there's a great blessing Satan starts to fight and church I stand here as a witness we bought a new ticket we went to Dubai and my husband booked the ticket a day after to go to India we were so depending on the Lord for that Visa it had to be Supernatural so the next day we went to the department to get the Visa the lady said there's no way you all can get this Visa they sent us to another department another we had to walk a good way when we reached there they said it takes 72 hours that's taking us into Monday now to get the visa so we just went and he is praying and I'm praying but in the night we had the plane to to get the next plane was the following day 1:00 and I'm praying on the bed I said father if if I know the president of the USA I know I can call him whoever great I can call but I know the greatest person on the face of the earth is King Jesus I said father we need the Visa before 9:00 tomorrow because we got to take a taxi to go to the airport church I stand here as a testimony and my husband was praying the same prayer not even knowing what he was saying and I said wake up wake up check your phone to see if the Visa came through and the Visa came through 8:36 that morning thank you Lord Jesus we got dressed and we went we went downstairs we said could you could you could you print out these visas for us they said they don't have color ink they only have black and white ink so they printed out black and white we got to India and in IM in Immigration my husband is there and I'm here they separated us and they're looking they said where did you all get this visa from from I said you're from you all they said no it's not in the system there's no way no evidence that we have a Visa given to you all they they brought all the delegates from the the Indian Embassy to see where we got this visa from but I know the god that we serve he is so real they couldn't find the Visa in the computer they brought all the high immigrations officer to look and they keep looking and they keep looking and they keep looking and they're watching us where did you all get this visa from where did you all get this visa from but we know the god that we serve he can give any papers like how we give brandom his green [Applause] card Church The Impossible became possible because it was just a few hours that we got the Visa normally is 72 hours it takes to get a Visa we went to India we never got sick and everybody said did you get sick did you get sick we ate everything we drank everywhere and the Lord kept our body so perfect that's the greatest Miracle go to India and don't get sick only God can watch over you in that place because it's the most it's the saddest place to go to the poorest of the poor thank you Jesus one church we went to the the language they don't have any message books and the pastor printed one book in their language and they give my husband to break the seal of the book I cried like a baby I said father we have thousands of books and tapes in America and this people just got one book and they're so happy it's like heaven came on Earth I said brother how much does this book cost he said 40 US cents I said I just want to be a part of this blessing church we are blessed beyond measure in America when you go and see poverty it breaks your heart these people walk miles and miles and miles and miles to come to church in a dirt floor we have carpet we have pews we have you name we have electricity we have everything and they love the Lord it touched my heart they hungry they don't even have food to eat but they come to church and they're raising their hand and they're praising the Lord I'm sorry church for crying but I've seen so much of God in those trips it made me love the Lord Jesus so much more to know there's Christians out day begging for a plate of food and we throw away food and the restaurants have a big sign please don't waste anything in here and I thank the Lord for taking us through all those trips all those hard hard hard hard hard her Journeys and bringing back us out the we went where the witches are the witches come out when you are Christians they come to attack you but none of them could touch us because we were covered under the blood I'm so grateful to share these testimonies with you all it's all about Jesus it's not about me or anybody else and I give God all the praise all the honor and all the glory and I just magnify his name

that you take full control of this service today and you'd receive all the honor and all the glory and all the praise and we ask you in no other name but the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with Thanksgiving amen and amen thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah just like read a little scripture before we take our seats amen I greet each and everyone in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen bring greetings to you from the family back home Mommy sends her greetings and her love she says greet everyone Wherever I Go She's approaching 90 and you know the challenges that goes with age in January she'll be 90 by the grace of God but she sends a love and her greetings amen I want to read from 1 Corinthians chapter 13 today it's a familiar scripture with each I'm sure with you all thank you brother Simmons for having me today it's been many a years since I've been this way amen though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have no charity I'm become as come as sounding brass and a tinkling symbol though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and I have no charity it profited me nothing charity suffer it long and is kind charity envieth not charity wanted not itself is not puffed up do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked think it no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth bear at all things believe at all things hope at all things endure at all things charity never faileth charity never faileth amen I think I needed to read that over with a little more me meaning and understanding amen charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongs they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through our glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abided faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated and thank you very much amen I'd also like to go to John chapter 3 it's familiar verse 16 for God God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved amen and amen today if I would have a a a name I don't usually have a name for my ser I'd call it redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die amen amen that's a team of my life that's a team of my story amen that's a team of every Christian's life and story amen I just try to get myself a little free I thank the Lord for testimonies shared and the songs amen maybe we could have just had a testimony night tonight brother Simmons I would have been happy to sit and [Laughter] listen amen and amen you know it was a battle to come here amen it's been long overdue to come visit brother Simmons and bring the family my wife is there Meer she's asleep and there's little William Meer was named after sister Renee I took a a variant of the name Renee and renel so she's MAA renell it's a variant of Renee amen but Simmons and his family has had a real deep impact on my life and my little Ministry whatever it is you can call it uh it's not much of a Ministry amen I'm not much of a speaker but over the years I've visited at times and I've always been happy to visit and I've always been blessed and I was so looking forward to visiting again and to be blessed because I I was under such great expectation to receive a blessing from the Lord just to be in the fellowship and the worship and to to hear the word of the Lord and it's so happens that I'm the speaker today so I trust that something some little thing would be said that would bless your heart amen you know there was a time that man had perfect fellowship with God way back in the Garden of Eden amen the Lord would come down and and speak to his son lip to air amen you they they lived constantly in the presence of the Lord amen amen constantly in the presence of the Lord oh what a place to live amen amen amen that's our place today am amen constantly in the presence of the Lord but I'm not I try not to take too long okay it's a little bit late and I'm watching the time trying come on go you know Trinidad usually has long winded preachers but I try not to be one of them today right maybe just for today I'd make up on Sunday amen yes and and way back I'm taking you a little bit back in time oh what a place to to dwell today we went into the zoo and looking at the Lions and the Tigers and all the animals and I just felt oh how I want to hug those Lions I wish I could yes I got that desire one day I will one day I will amen I I wanted to say Leo hey come on Leo and Rob him behind his head and you see just do that but he's in a fallen state right we're in a fallen state right now okay yeah but I'm telling you the truth I I really wanted to because that's my desire there's something within me calling back for what we've lost amen there was a time when Adam would call Leo hell Leo and he come and he'd play with him and Pat him on his back and and rub his belly he'd turn over like a little cat and you know he he'd let him rub his his his tummy a little bit do you believe that yes sir amen they lived in a constant place of perfect love amen there was no hate there was no bitterness there was no malice there was no sin amen oh how they enjoyed that fellowship with the Lord amen living in the beauty of his Holiness amen living as a true Son of God ought to live living as a true daughter of God ought to live amen but one day sin broke that Fellowship amen amen Eve stopped to listen her Mystic was stopping to listen amen amen stopping to listen you see she was no match for Satan's shrewdness yeah she was not of the original creation it's not the truth amen he couldn't come to Adam with his foolishness right amen but God allowed it all because within him he had all these attributes that he wanted to express and he wanted to express all these attributes in its fullness not just in part not just in measure amen is that the truth amen he wanted to express it in its fullness how can I express my love in its fullness unless there's a fall how can I show I'm a Healer we've heard the testimonies unless there's sickness there's got to be hate for us to know what real love is amen goe amen there's got to be Wars for us to know what true peace is amen so the battles are good amen amen and we have true peace in the midst of the storm in the midst of the battle we have a peace that passed all understanding the normal man can't understand how could you be so calm and peaceful in the midst of the battle yes amen amen how can you return love for hate how can you return good for evil you see there is still in that Fallen condition but you've been redeemed you've been restored and you've been restored back to all that Adam had lost amen hallelujah I can just see when when Adam knew what took place do you think Adam had to consider take it over am I willing to die because when he first saw Eve he said that's bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and that love for his wife just took a hold of him and that kept a hold of him throughout his life amen amen so when he knew what took place Eve was deceived Adam wasn't he knew what he was doing he was willing to die because he loved his wife so much he didn't have to think it over he didn't have to consider oh no he didn't have to because it just flowed from him naturally unconsciously he loved his wife yes that's the way we ought to love one another we not got to consider should I love my brother or should I not it ought to be unconsciously we love one another unconsciously we do good for Ev unconsciously our brother is falling we don't have to consider will I go after him redeeming love has been my team and shall be till I die we can take examples throughout the scripture you know we talk a lot about Abraham's fate I want to talk a little bit about Abraham's love amen going after his Fallen brother Abraham being a prophet and being spiritual he would have known that his lot was a caral Believer being spiritually minded he would have recognized the caral minded lot because lot he was just after the things of the world oh he wanted he wanted the popularity he wanted to be the mayor in the city he wanted to be wealthy and all these nothing's wrong with that okay that's fine but don't let let that be the end of it all for you if the Lord blesses you that way that's fine but Let Jesus be the center and the team of our life amen amen if Jesus is not in it I want it goodbye world Amen we just sign it do we mean it amen amen uhuh we seen lot was overtaken the some Army had taken his his captured them and and and Abraham not he wasn't a soldier you know he was just an ordinary man he wasn't a well- trained soldier and yeah just naturally that love kicked in for his Fallen brother for his backslid brother isn't that the truth yes he didn't have to consider it and say you know we we had Wars among ourselves oh yeah we were fighting and fasting and there was Strife among our men and I've tried to preach this message oh so much to to to lot but he just won't listen you know how sometimes with our children we try to teach them the right thing and many of times they just won't listen does that stop all of NOS when it's coming from deep down in the soul no no no no son you may go that way but I'm staying right here praying for you one day God's going to bring you back I might go but my prayer is going to be remaining there even if I gone on to the other side my prayer is going to remain there and one day you're going to come back redeeming love has been my team the one who redeemed me going to bring you back I know what redeeming love is I know where it brought me from and what if it did it for me it'll do it for you yes sir oh he went after he he won the battle but still you know L just couldn't help being the way he is you see just like the way we just can't help being the way we are you were predestinated to be what you are amen We Are Who We Are by the grace of God it wasn't my choice it was somebody chose me oh that ought to produce such a love and heart a love that knows no bounds a love that we can't measure a love that reach down to the lowest hell yes sir a love that Co cover a multitude of sin I love that see the need of each other that ought to be the team of our life isn't that the truth yes sir you know when God came down and he said you know I can't withhold from Abraham what I'm going to do Abraham being a prophet amen and God comes to reveal what he's going to do to His prophets isn't that the truth yes sir surely the Lord will do nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophets amen so he couldn't withhold from Abraham what he was going to do oh and here comes Abraham he gets down on his knee I just dramatizing it a little bit now so Lord for chance it's 50 and he goes down and down and down what was Lot doing sorry Abraham doing he was going after his Fallen brother he knew that destruction was ahead don't we know that destruction's ahead too so what it ought to do to us what manner of people ought we to be you see we we can understand all the Mysteries we we can have an a mental understanding of it yes because we're made different to the all the other animals right we can reason we can read we can understand we can hear we can understand we can come to a mental recognition that it's the truth we can come to a mental recognition that this is something out of the ordinary amen but it's got a go deeper than that this word's got to Anchor into our soul it's got to be anointed by the Holy Spirit yes sir to bring it alive in us amen amen This Love that I'm speaking is not just ordinary love friends this is the love of God and it ought to Flow Free through US yes sir the Holy Spirit ought to have the liberty and the freedom to flow freely through US yes sir it's good to understand that we've been restored back to all that Adam had lost but God is requiring of us a consecrated life a certain type of walk a certain type of a talk and it ought to be so unconscious it ought to be our nature because we're partakers of his divine nature aren't we yes sir that ought to be who you really are I'm a Son of God and a son lives a certain way a son talks a certain way a son thinks a certain certain way a Son of God acts a certain way God is manifested through a true Son of God God manifested himself through a true daughter of God now I'm not speaking about a love like a a doy old grandfather you know no sir you can read that love is not easily provoked it suffer at long he's not going to always strive at man yes sir remember it's redeeming love amen redeeming is to bring back that which was lost to its original state right so you always had to be aart to be redeemed back to this it's not the truth yes sir oh if you were not a part of it then there's no Redemption for you right it's not the truth and when that last one is redeemed when that last one is redeemed then that's it amen but you see you and I we don't know who is who we don't know who is who and we're not to judge who's who because a son or a daughter of God could reach so deep down in sin or so far away they they look nothing like a seed outwardly they may not look not like a seed that's why we ought not to judge yes sir remember that woman caught in adultery look at redeeming love in action oh all all all the holy men would have seen she was caught in the very act caught in the very act well if she was caught in the very act where was the man so you you already see that's not no righteous judgment there right that was no righteous judgment there what did Jesus say he said go and sin no more he said where where is your accusers he said all if you got no sin those without sin cast the first stone you know he was that one he was that one but he came to save his own and she was one of them yes sir and he knew she was one of them amen what did he do he projected that love and the grace of God Sovereign Grace took over isn't that the truth amen love had reached its destination amen and Sovereign Grace took over yes sir that's what happened to you and I the story may have been a little bit different because we all got different stories in our lives isn't that the truth but it was the redeeming love of God that met you in the condition in which you were and what did it tell you that's not the life I called you to live that's not a life I created you to live I created you to live above sin yes sir I created you to [Music] live a life of one that is invincible isn't that the truth we ought to be an invincible Army isn't that the truth yes sir sat not to to keep us down and beaten and battered now all those things are good because we're here to learn a character is being molded in us we're being brought to a place of perfection isn't that the truth god is perfect in our love you know he's perfecting our faith you know and he's got a way to do it he's got a process in which he brings you into that place of perfection because he's going to have a his purpose that he'll have a perfect bride amen yes sir and these things that comes our way is to bring us into that place of perfection and he's the perfect one so what is he looking for he's looking to see himself in you and I yes sir Adam lived a perfect life before the fall in a perfect garden of Eden but God is doing something so great in this day Hallelujah he's bringing a Perfect Bride to live a perfect life in this Fallen condition in this Fallen sinful world yes sir he's bringing forth such an invincible group of people such a powerful group of people that when he sees her at that place of perfection he says that's power of my power that's life of my life that's word of my word she is me just as when Adam saw his wife when he sees his bride and that's what he's doing to this day oh we ought to be so much further up the road we ought to be so much yielded more yielded to so fully surrendered in his hands living such a consecrated life onto the Lord yes sir why you can flow so freely true you and me manifesting himself fulfilling his word fulfilling the scripture for the hour one of these days you're going to be walking in such perfect fate Hallelujah you're going to walk like Enoch walked yes sir yes sir I believe it I know it's the truth yes sir I see the gray heads coming on all the wrinkles around and the aches and the pains are coming along but I ain't getting older the real me he can't get old yes sir the real you one day I'll step out of this Hallelujah redeeming love did that for me redeeming love did that for you amen amen the love of God did that for me and you Hallelujah so come what me whatever the devil TR our away oh we may stumble a little bit here or there but he'll never defeat us hallelujah for one day I'm going to take a trip Hallelujah you know I like to tell him where he's going he he don't like to hear Too Much yeah lately I've been telling him more and more oh he he gets really upset he tries to do every other thing that he could do to keep me down but he's old already defeated you know the prophet said when when if he thinks he's got the upper hand on you then he'll give you a little proposition he like the doctor will tell you well you just got six months to live the cancer is so bad and there's no cure and you can accept that you know or you can reject it it's like Goliath he he told they told Israel they got Israel's back to the wall so Israel's going to make a deal with them you know like what they're doing now is the same old devil all the time Same Old Devil he he think they got their backs to the wall so let's make a deal right same devil he comes to you let let's make a deal I'll give you just six more months to live well I'll tell him that's not in your hands it's not for you to tell me how how long I live no sir that's not in his hands oh dear Satan would do a thing like that now if he thinks you got the upper hand he'll do that but if you got him in a corner I said if you got him in a corner amen amen you'll see what a coward he really is when he sees real perfect love comes on the scene yes sir when you see real perfect Faith come on the scene now Faith and love are married together you know they kin folks you can't have one without the other no sir yes oh oh hallelujah oh those early Apostles had him in such a corner that the very Shadow he was afraid of yes sir what manner of people ought we to be what a powerful Invincible group of people want we to be because it's not you doing it it's your almighty God doing it through you and I but we got to learn to get ourselves out of the way we got to learn to Humble ourselves Master the thought of human ability realize you can't do it but there is someone who can and he's chosen to do it through you yes sir he's chosen to do it through you he's called you to this walk amen he's called you to this life this invincible life and when you realize who you really are what you really been called to you come up a little higher and as he reveals more because it takes a revelation to do this to your life you know it it's not had knowledge and I didn't come here today with good psychology okay you got to have a supernatural experience with God Amen you got to know him the power of his resurrection you got to know what power you really God within you by the Holy Spirit and what you've been called to we're called to adoption you know in this day so all these trials and these testings it's for own good it's to perfect us to bring out a perfect God in all his perfect power and might and strength and victory love his sweetness his kindness his gentleness whatever for whatever situation whatever might be the situation be so yielded to him that he takes control of that situation yes sir for every situation may be different we're dealing with many different people here today and everybody's got their own fighting their own battle and their own situation but you know he's dealing with each and everyone yes sir and their own way he knows what you have need of and if I could just get myself out of the way if you can just get yourself out of the way if we all can get ourselves out of the way I let him just flow through us let them anoint that faith that you've got in your heart he'll take control of that situation he'll do the things that you know nothing about for his ways a past finding out isn't that the truth yes sir and the sooner we can learn to yield ourselves now that's the secret between you and God you know I can't teach you that I can't teach you that you got to have that experience for your yourself and you ought to become so familiar with it I I hope you you you got what I'm saying that you're so sensitive to his presence yes sir and you'll see him take control of that situation it don't take much loud words it don't take much words at all you remember the disciples when they try to cast out that devil maybe lots of shouting and screaming or whatever and all Jesus had to do was come out of it you see those words were anointed words and SATA knows the difference you can't Bluff him he's a bluff so he knows a good bluff I said he's he's a real good bluff so he knows you you can't Bluff him better than he can Bluff right and you can't Bluff this love you can't Bluff this Faith you can't Bluff this anointing he knows the genuine thing he's a spirit so he knows the real thing and he's afraid of the real thing when he sees the real thing coming he know he backs up in a corner and you see the real coward that he really is because he's absolutely defeated yes sir amen do you really believe that amen aren't you thankful that we serve a god like that that has brought us right back to that so what are you telling them I've got to do BR Paul we got to consecrate ourselves more we got to be more sincere all this power is already within you you know when you receive the Holy Ghost it's already within you but you got to learn to unlock it and let it flow so freely as he would you got to learn when to stand when he'll stand and he'll stay still when he'll speak you got to learn isn't that the truth this is not about going empty in all the hospitals and showing how no sir song's good huh we would like to do do that I would like to do that I don't like to see people suffering but I want to be in the perfect will of God all the time I don't want to misstep I want to be like how it was in the Garden of Eden in the perfect will of God for they were in the perfect will of God all the time isn't that the truth and that's what we've been restored back to the perfect will of God how can I do this brother Paul I got to consecrate myself more I got to dedicate myself more I got to be so yielded and fully surrendered in his hands I got to be as Paul said a prisoner of Jesus Christ I got to love him so much now that love is already within you yes it is because you recognize his love to towards you and when you recognize that a God could love you so much in the condition that you were and make you to what you are it ought to produce isn't that the truth a love back to him it ought to produce a fate yes sir I believe his every word his every promise but I believe the Lord's calling us friends I truly believe that because I believe the Rapture is at hand I believe we're living way below our privileges with what we got he's calling us he's calling you and I today to Humble ourselves more more yielded so fully yielded in his hands that way he says go out go what he says do I do he'll speak through me it'll be so unconscious I'm so yielded to him that unconsciously he'll flow through me and I'll hear myself saying yes I'll hear myself saying isn't that what was demonstrated before us in this day well that's for you and I God's calling us to this perfect fate this perfect walk that's what we've been redeemed back to per Perfection Perfection is calling us we're being called to Perfection we're not looking through a dark glass anymore no sir the Seal's been revealed we can see God's Great Plan of Redemption made plain before our eyes we can see what lays ahead for us well let's walk let's do like Joshua and Caleb Caleb said give me my Mountain give me my inheritance I'm speaking about your inheritance today as a son and as a daughter of God as a redeemed son and as a redeemed daughter give me my inheritance Lord give me my inheritance what is required Love Me Lord and whatever the spirit ask you to do do it sometime you ask us we no longer you got to as Abraham was told you got to separate yourself from your Kindred and your people and your talk remember he took a along lot with him and not until he was fully separated could God begin to bless him yes sir so God is calling us to certain things in our lives you would know personally what he's calling you to You' know the Holy Spirit speaking into your heart and you would know what he's asking you to do what you got to lay aside what you got to stop because and he's asking of you to do these things because he wants to take you to another level amen yes sir I believe the Church of the Living God is being called oh my so much higher than where we are we got a lot of emotion we got a lot of knowledge we got a lot of all these things but where is that Spirit flowing so freely when you're so anointed under the holy spirit that it's no longer you speaking it's no longer me speaking it's no longer my hands it's now his hands yes sir that's what we recall to it's no longer my feet and there's some places his feet won't go yes sir there's some things his hands won't do yes sir there's some thoughts he won't think now if you can't stop the birds from flying over your head right but you can stop them from building the nest okay yes sir and we got a double b shotgun to keep them away from us right we got the word of God so when he brings anything negative your way oh you use the word of God in him sir it's effective it's powerful it's mighty can never be defeated and if you you use it so too you'll never be defeated amen yes sir it's it's perfect for every situation amen go I said it's perfect for every situation don't you just love him I'm watching the time there oh my I've taken a lot of your time already but I love the Lord I know what he's calling me to I know he ain't calling me alone because this ain't no one man bride [Laughter] right and I ain't going to be raptured before you when you coming later on [Laughter] right so I'm here to encourage your hearts today to lay aside everything that so easily beset us press on like never before press on to that place of perfection that the Holy Spirit has called us to in this day he's called us to a more consecrated life more dedicated life to be more sincere in our walk in our service unto him you know prayer life yes sir how many is willing to respond to his call today today I lift my Bo my hands let's B our heads right where you are you talk to him in your own little way Lord I know you're calling us all Lord Jesus to a closer walk with you we want to live so close to you Lord that when you come you
