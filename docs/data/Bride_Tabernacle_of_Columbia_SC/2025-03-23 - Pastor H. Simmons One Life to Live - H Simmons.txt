he shall reward what every man according to his work God bless you in his word you may be seated amen are you looking forward to your reward am I want to talk about this morning One Life to Live you have Only One Life to Live Now often times we we would like to rewind the tape and play it all over again because we'll see things that we saw when we were teenagers and we we get 30 we see things a little different amen so we want to rewind the choices I made at 13 and 14 at 30 I wouldn't make those choices things that I did at 30 and 45 brother J I I I I I probably would change it some of the things and some of the decisions I made and at 60 the things that I did at 45 I probably would rewind the tape and I do a little things different at 45 when I get 60 brother FR I can't go as far as you can go but when I got 70 I do a little different than the things I did at 60 something about life I only got one time to live it I only got one life to live but I'm always learning amen I'm always gaining uh wisdom and knowledge always see the need of doing things better are doing things are different because somehow some folk they [Applause] live the life they live at 16 they still trying to live it at 60 that person has not learned anything are you with me and I challenge some folks at 90 they still trying to be 20 are you with me they haven't learned much amen but blessed is the person that will gain wisdom with gry head the one that will uh uh learn from their [Music] mistakes in life you might struggle and make mistakes and you gain knowledge and you gain wisdom from the mistakes you made many times I said if I had a chance to do it over i' do that a little different am uh uh age make you slow down not only do your steps get slow but your decisions yes you make a you have patience you have more patient you don't come Hasty to judgment and you're not ready amen quick to make a decision because you're older this hurry up hurry up sometimes the children said Daddy Daddy you taking too long what you got what you coming to I said wait wait a minute they got slow downen you know I'm coming now but you're going all the way around the care just tell me straight wait a minut that's what old do oh you slow down yes oh you want to you want to say and you think you have to you know you know you want to say it where it it can be impactful just uh K them and I coming back from uh uh um Marion he said okay Daddy I said wait a minute it probably took 30 minutes for me to tell him what I want to tell him cuz he said I got it I said no you ain't got it yet son let let me tell it they might took hour you you you see what I'm saying because I want want to tell you I want to make sure you understand it you only got one time one life you only got One Life to Live okay let's go to Deuter Roman 20 I mean 30 uh Caleb deuteron 30 And1 you only got One Life to Live are you with me amen and see see see sometime we we go through it so in in such a hurry we want to do things so hastily sometimes the person you married you probably wouldn't you married them at 25 and you wish you at 50 you realize hey I wouldn't have doubt it if I had the sense I got at 50 oh you was me see sometime you you don't you at at at 22 21 you looking at how the outside when you get 50 you looking at hey this person got any sense I I'm looking at hey does this person has the stamina to be a father to be a good husband a good wife are you with me so I'm looking at I'm more looking interested in your character not how strong you are not how goodlooking you think you are I'm looking for somebody who can have some character about themselves and carry themselves with some kind of standard amen but at 20 is all by eyesight and sometime you just get caught up in the moment and we make hasty decisions well if You' have just waited and got a little wisdom and sometimes at 20 you don't want to listen cu nobody because what oh y'all got it you know it all you know what you want you know what you're doing you find out at 50 you didn't know what you was doing and you don't know at all are you with me it may not get 50 you may get 40 and find out some find it out by the time they get 30 I don't know at all I I I want you to understand what Solomon said trust in the Lord with all th what and lean not to what th own understanding but in all thy ways him and he direct path shall direct th path are you with me so uh you know if if you would only trust him amen he'll Lead You amen he'll guide you in right right direction probably God spoke a message forsaken all you only got One Life to Live are you willing to forsake all all that you got amen see sometimes we make decisions as christans whether or not we want to come to the real knowled am I willing to give it up somebody said take up your cross and follow him count up the cause and what count up the cause brother Gandy count up the cause and take up your cross and what y'all can hear Brother Gandy now are you with me you see what I'm saying you take up your cross but you got the count up the car okay Caleb uh Deuteronomy 30 and 11 and it reads for this commandment which I commanded thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should us say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it see God commandment now now God is saying something to you today and I want you to know he's saying you only got what One Life to Live you only got one life to live so you need to understand and here today because you ain't going to have a chance to do it over and if you don't take life serious so I don't know what you talking about taking life serious I don't even understand of about what you talking about taking life serious

why you came back you had to sing that song God Amen God is good amen okay it's in my heart it's got to be something not not just in the Bible but it's in my heart amen amen if thou should confess with the mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God is raisen from the dead thou shall be what saved are you a bit amen amen are you saved I said are you saved this morning Mary are you

sound solid decision in within yourself amen make a decision what you going to choose amen you know sometime we make the wrong choices we choose friendship over the word amen we choose family over the word we choose many things over the word you let those things have the the preeminence in your life this worldly things we let them have the preeminence instead of the word of God we don't want to put Jesus first and God's word first we put the things of this world first as though they going to be good for you but they're going to they're going to end up it's just it's just deceitful the devil will deceive you he will trick you he will wow you and he'll get you in a place that you realize is not comfortable are you whoop me because you made the wrong decision how do I know when God is talking to
