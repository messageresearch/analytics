[41:20] Treasures

[41:26] corrupt nor will thieves do not break

[41:34] where your treasure is there will your
[41:38] what also God bless you read this word
[41:41] you may be seated now on last week we
[41:45] were talking about looking to the what
[41:47] unseen look to the Unseen right and we
[41:51] said the world that is not seen is more
[41:53] real because uh Second Corinthians says
[41:57] while we look maybe we'll look that
[42:00] again just
[42:02] for um to bring those that were wasn't
[42:06] here up to part because we uh like
[42:10] continuing where your treasure is there
[42:12] will your heartbe we want you to think
[42:15] on the thought Treasures in
[42:18] Heaven now you can look at somebody and
[42:21] says Treasures Treasures in Heaven in
[42:25] heaven Treasures in Heaven I want
[42:28] Treasures in Heaven

[42:32] uh that was U second
[42:37] Corinthians
[42:40] four let me just oh she got it for me I
[42:44] don't have to go he says for which cause
[42:47] we faint not but though our outward man
[42:51] perish yet our en man is what renewed
[42:56] day by day
[42:57] next for our light Affliction which is
[43:03] but for a moment worketh for us a for
[43:07] more and
[43:09] what Eternal weight of
[43:12] Glory while we look not at the things
[43:15] which what seen are seen but the things
[43:19] which are not seen for the things which
[43:21] are seen are what temporal temporal but
[43:24] the things
[43:25] which are not not seen a etal Eternal so
[43:30] everything that you see is temporary
[43:32] amen are you with me amen and we said
[43:36] look to the Unseen unseen look to the
[43:40] Unseen now we saying Treasures in Heaven
[43:44] as a continuation Treasures in Heaven
[43:48] because if this world that we see is
[43:53] just a
[43:54] temporary thing
[43:57] then would you like the Eternal
[44:01] Treasures Treasures in
[44:03] Heaven now we were bought with a a
[44:07] decision that a young man made uh some
[44:09] time ago in Jesus day he um Luke 18 for
[44:15] a minute Luke 18 a young man made a
[44:21] decision I think Caleb touched on it on
[44:23] on um Friday night 18 18 1818 Luke
[44:28] 18:18 it says and a certain ruler asks
[44:33] him somebody call him a certain Young
[44:35] Rich ruler okay and a certain ruler asks
[44:39] him good
[44:41] Master what shall I do to inherit
[44:44] eternal life and Jesus said unto him why
[44:49] call thou me what there's none good say
[44:54] one that is what thou know the
[44:57] Commandment do not
[45:00] what do not commit adultery do not what
[45:04] do not kill do not steal do not bear
[45:07] false Witnesses honor thy father and thy
[45:10] mother and he said all these things have
[45:13] I what kept from my youth up now when
[45:17] Jesus heard these things he said un him
[45:21] yet
[45:23] what one
[45:25] thing he says
[45:27] what s all that thy has in
[45:33] what and thou shallal what trees in
[45:37] heaven I'm talking about this morning
[45:40] Treasures in
[45:42] Heaven amen but you got to sell out to
[45:45] get
[45:46] them amen now which one would you rather
[45:50] have the the treasures here or the
[45:53] Treasures in
[45:55] Heaven see because
[45:57] uh uh most
[45:59] people I don't know whether they realize
[46:02] that there is a
[46:04] heaven
[46:05] because
[46:08] they Treasures that they're trying to uh
[46:13] accumulate not knowing that those
[46:15] Treasures are going to they're just
[46:17] temporary
[46:19] things those things are not Eternal am
[46:23] so a lot of times uh people spend all
[46:26] their life building up a treasure
[46:31] here and I said it's not worth
[46:35] it look to he said the
[46:38] world that we see
[46:42] now it's a world that's going to burn
[46:46] it's going to fade
[46:49] away but the Unseen World is more
[46:53] real than this one
[46:57] praise God but it takes you to have
[47:03] faith that it
[47:05] exist
[47:07] amen that there is a world that
[47:12] exists as we said on last week though
[47:15] our outward man perish the inward man is
[47:18] renewed day by day amen amen if our
[47:21] Earthly House of this Tabernacle where

[53:44] maybe he
[53:53] says let's just go to the 30th verse
[53:57] for all these things do the nations of
[54:00] the world seek

[56:48] mindset now you think I'm going to give
[56:49] it up
[56:52] no I'd rather have this for a little
[56:54] while

[1:12:29] garage so I was just
[1:12:34] throwing and all of a sudden I came to
[1:12:36] some parts of a
[1:12:39] car and I I junk to
[1:12:43] me no don't do that why she treasured
[1:12:47] that it was one of those what back in
[1:12:50] the T Fords or something and they just
[1:12:54] had to put it back you can't throw these
[1:12:56] parts around the they were very valuable
[1:12:58] very expensive parts so sometimes people
[1:13:02] value certain things people
[1:13:05] value certain anti things people value
[1:13:10] things that are very pricey they valued
[1:13:14] and see what I'm saying but at the same

[1:13:52] you again if you ever received the
[1:13:55] baptism with the Holy
[1:13:57] Ghost you had to surrender
[1:14:00] what you had to surrender
[1:14:03] all because God speaks to you I remember
[1:14:07] certain things I had to come to grips
[1:14:10] with you know I didn't have to get up
[1:14:12] off my knees and and go back and say I
[1:14:15] had to stop doing this and stop doing
[1:14:17] that had to give up this and that it
[1:14:19] just came to my
[1:14:20] heart when I was seeking the Lord for
[1:14:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I I it
[1:14:25] just came to me you got to give up
[1:14:28] this and I know I had to be willing to
[1:14:31] say yes Lord you got to give up that yes
[1:14:35] Lord you got to give up everything yes
[1:14:39] because I wanted I Valu the Holy Ghost
[1:14:42] more than all of that and I wanted the
[1:14:44] Holy Ghost more than anything that I
[1:14:47] had and I know without the Holy Ghost I

[1:14:58] be able to live a Christian Life I need
[1:15:00] the Holy Ghost amen amen

[1:15:06] well I just want to accept
[1:15:08] Christ and that that that their form of
[1:15:11] accepting Christ is just going through a
[1:15:13] ritual going through a formality but not
[1:15:15] really in their heart they really sold
[1:15:18] out that I want Christ in my heart
[1:15:21] because I need him in my life amen amen
