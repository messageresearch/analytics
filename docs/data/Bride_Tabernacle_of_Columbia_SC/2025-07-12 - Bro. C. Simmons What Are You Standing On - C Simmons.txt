If you have your Bibles tonight, we'll turn to Matthew chapter Matthew chapter 7. Amen. And verse 24. [Music] Matthew 7 and 24. When you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "Therefore, whosoever these things are of mine, and do with him, I will like him unto a wise man, which build which built his house upon a rock. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand. And the rains descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sins, the people were astonished at all his doctrine. Amen. God bless the others prayer. You may be seated. Amen. Tonight, tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled, "What are you standing on?" What are you standing on? And I read from the scripture because it was powerful because it's very important for you to understand what's what what you're standing on. It's very important for you to understand that what is your foundation because whatever you're building on in life, it has to start from a foundation. It has to be built upon something. And if you if you are unsure of what that something is, you you don't you you might be on sand. And when the winds and storms of life blow, it can wash you this way and wash you that way. And it may even crumble and fall. But tonight, I encourage you to make sure that you that whatever you're standing on, you're standing on a rock. &gt;&gt; And when you stand on this rock, you can stand firm and you can be assured in what you're standing on. You know that it's not going to shift to and fro. You know that when you stand on on this rock, it's not going to move. You know that when someone came and come and says this or that, you're not going to change because you're standing on something that's solid. You're standing on something that's firm that no matter which way the waters come and push that rock, it's not moving. No matter what comes against it, it's not moving because you're standing on that rock. And as long as you're standing upon the rock, you shall not be moved. As long as you're standing on that rock, there's nothing that can move you off of that foundation because you s you're standing on something that's solid that'll stand beyond the test of time, that'll stand until eternity. But you got to make sure that you're standing on the rock. But I asked the question, what are you standing on? Because some people are unsure. That's why it's easy for them to turn this way and turn that way. And you wonder why some people after many years they turn and they go this way or go that way. Well, I question where they standing on a rock. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Were they standing on the rock that shall not be moved? Were they standing on the rock that didn't change? the way they standing on the rock that said I'll be the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now, when you look through the scriptures, you you'll understand that who is the rock. And in 2 Samuel 22 and 32, it says, "For who is God and save the Lord? Who is a rock? Save our God." And in Psalms, he said, "For who is God save the Lord, and who is a rock save our God." Yes. &gt;&gt; In Psalm 62 and2 it says, "He only is my rock and my salvation. He is my defense and I shall not be greatly moved." &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 18. I'll turn to there. Psalms 18 and verse one. You got to say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "And I will love thee, oh Lord, my strength." But verse two, it says, "The Lord is my rock." See, David understood after all that that he had went through the where who his rock was. He understood that this was the rock that I need to be standing on. This is the thing that I need to be standing on. He said, "The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer." He understood while he was standing on that rock, he had deliverance. When he stood on that rock, he had victory. When he stood on that rock, there was nothing that could stand against him. No matter how high the waters of life may have tread against David, he understood where he stood. He understood that there was nobody could talk him off of this rock. There was no one that could talk him out of the God that had come and stood and was the rock cuz he understood his rock was Jesus. His rock was God. He understood that he was my God and my strength and in whom I will trust. That's what he said. My buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower. See, he understood what his rock was. It was more than just a rock. It was something that could keep him when he couldn't keep himself. It was something that would stand firm when he couldn't stand himself. It was something that would allow him to have victory when he shouldn't have had victory. It was something that would allow him to have overcoming power when he shouldn't have overcome &gt;&gt; because the rock was God. It was something that was greater than him. And Daniel, he he spoke the story about the if you read the scriptures in Daniel and he talked about there was a stone hun out of the mountain and it came and knocked down the statue. And when you read that story, you realize that there was something powerful about this rock. It was something that you might not have understood. But when when you go pick up a rock, you realize many of times if it's a real solid rock, you can't crush it. You can try as hard as you can. Get one about the size of your fist and try to try to squeeze it and see if you can break it. See see when you have a rock is something that's solid. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And many people we get we are in a time in a in a thing that people are are are going after many things &gt;&gt; or people are searching in this day and age in what what do I believe in? &gt;&gt; What what what what do I what what what is going to be my foundation? And many of people that are coming up, they're not just accepting something because it's taught to them. And because we live in an age where there's so much visibility, we can see about many different things. All it takes is you typing in a question. There's AI to do the work for you now. So you don't even have to go and search website to website. It'll give you everything that you want about any subject, anything. And so you can go and search Christianity. You can go and search Hinduism. You can go and search Islam. You can go and search all these many things. But when you come down and you search it, there's many people that have searched it. But you realize there has to be something that you stand on. &gt;&gt; And there has to be something that you can turn to. And the reason that that some people can choose this or that. They have their many different reasons. But and sometimes it's a product of their environment, where they grow up and where they are. Pastor was preaching about that the other day and and he was talking and he was talking about it and I realized that sometimes that you have to you have to find what is going to be your foundation. &gt;&gt; What will you stand on? And each one of us have to come on that journey by oursel. &gt;&gt; Each one of us have to come to that place by oursel. We can't stand on mama and daddy rock. We got to stand on our own. We got to realize what the rock is. We got to understand that we can turn to the rock when we have nowhere else to turn to. We got to understand that we got to make sure our house is on that firm foundation. That we stable on that firm foundation and that the even though the structure might be rickety, we realize that the foundation is solid. &gt;&gt; See, sometimes the winds and water blow and it'll blow down the structure, but it don't blow the foundation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the foundation was solid. And sometimes God allow things to come that'll blow down your structure because he wants you to build a stronger structure. He wants you to build something that has a has a stronger he the foundation was right but the structure was wrong. &gt;&gt; So he allow you to go around and when the winds and blow it'll blow the structure but not the foundation because you got to get once you start building on that foundation and realizing what the foundation is you realize how to build on it. Many people, they got a foundation, but they're building the wrong structure on the foundation. They're not taking full advantage of the foundation. If you had a foundation and and the foundation was the size of this right here, right here, this tabletop, and I built something only on this side of this table, and I'm not taking full advantage of the rest of the space. So, God allowed to you to destroy this so he can build something bigger. He can build something greater. So you can take full advantage of everything that he gave to you. &gt;&gt; And when you realize how big your foundation is, you can realize that everything that he gave unto Adam, he gave unto you. And you realize that this foundation was greater than I thought it was. This rock that I'm standing on is the rock that has the power of of life and death. He has the power of everything. And he said, I given it unto you. But if you never realize what he's given unto you, you'll never build upon it. You'll never say, "Lord, I take it at your word and I believe what you said and I can stand on it. I can stand on this and I can stand on what you've given me cuz this rock right here is solid and it ain't going to move. And I know that I tried it and I tested and I found out for myself that it it's a solid rock. It's a rock that I can when you leave me there, I don't have to move off of it because it's solid. I don't have to go nowhere because it's a solid rock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, he said, "And tonight, maybe cancer has conquered you. Maybe something else has taken a hold of you. Some disease, even even the disease of sin or whatever it is, it may look dark or gloomy to you now, but may look like you'll never recover." See, sometimes the devil will get you to a place that you will think that you'll never recover. He'll take you to a spot and get you so entangled in your mind and you deal with the year after year that you'll think that you'll never recover. He said maybe look like you can't get over that that prostate trouble or that lung trouble, whatever it is, that tumor, that crippling condition. The doctor may say every hope is gone. But standing right by your side tonight, right, ready to take you in possession, stands the eyes of faith who sees the victory yonder through the Lord Jesus Christ. Away from Satan and his gloom and up with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the faith of almighty God. See, faith can take its holy stand on the rock of ages. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said faith can take its holy stand on on the rock of ages and pierce an eagle's eye through every storm cloud when the very waves of death and disappointments tries to wash the foundation from under you. Said sometimes God sometimes it'll be disappointment that'll try to wash the foundation from under you. Sometimes the it's the waves of death that tries to wash it and says it can stand there and look beyond the the skies and say God is right. &gt;&gt; And believe the counsel of the wise and the living God. It said it can look beyond the skies and say God is right. &gt;&gt; Many people struggle with something with they struggle with with believing in God is because they can't see him. But the only way to see God is to have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way to see God is to believe in him and have faith and see what he'll do. And by the by his many works, you can testify that there is a God. By his many works, you can testify that God is real. By his many works, you can say, I can only see that you're standing on the rock by the manifestations of what it produces. said, "I can only understand that you're standing there by faith is by the manifestation of what it produces." And when you see what it produces, you can realize that that person has faith. You can realize that that person believes in something that's greater than them. You can realize that they believe in a God that's real. And it might not be real to you, but it's real to me. And I don't have to understand to believe that you serve a real and a true and a living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, even even the devil believes in God, but he trembles. If the devil can believe in him, why can't you? Why can't everyone believe in a God if the devil can? &gt;&gt; See, the difference is the devil has seen God. &gt;&gt; We might not have, but he has. So he he knows that God is real. And said if he knows that God is real, it should give you encouragement for you to continue to believe. It should give you encouragement to continue to walk on in faith and say, "I want to see the God that created me. I want to get to a point that I do the right things that I can see that God." &gt;&gt; Said, "There's only things that I have to do. The God he positioned in his word that if I believe and I trust in him and I do the steps that he provided for me, I can one day see him." And when I see them, I you don't know what may happen, but I know that there's a sound of joy. There's a sound of victory. There's a sound of rejoicing that's happening there &gt;&gt; because that's what God wants. He always wanted. That's why he created you and me. So that we can praise him. So that we can give him glory, give him honor. And so Lord, I thank you for the rock that you created. Lord, I thank you that I'm able to stand on my firm foundation. Lord, I thank you that I'm able to move and I can I can give you glory, give you honor, give you praise &gt;&gt; because I can testify that God is real. I can testify that the rock that I'm standing on is greater than anything that you can stand on. I can testify that Jesus is the rock that I'm standing on and that he can move and he can deliver. He can save. He can set free. &gt;&gt; See, I'm a living testament of what God can do. Lord. &gt;&gt; And even if he ain't done it yet, he's still in the process of doing it. And even if I don't ever see him do it, I know that he's still able to do it. See, that's the God that I'm standing on. I'm standing right there only because my faith is elevated. I can see beyond the clouds. I can see beyond the storm. And I can see that God is the one that's going to deliver. God is the one that are set free. God is the one that'll do the impossible. All I have to do is believe. See, I understand what I'm standing on now. &gt;&gt; See, that's why some people can shout even on the down days. That's why some people can give God praise even when they going through the storm because they had the faith that God is going to deliver me. They understand what they're standing on. They're not shaken by the winds. They're not shaken by the storms. They're not shaken by the trials and tribulation cuz they understand what they're standing on. They're standing on a God that's real. &gt;&gt; They're standing on a God that can do the impossible. They're standing on a God that all I have to do is have faith in him. All I have to do is believe and he can do what I ask above all that I ask or think. That's the God that I serve. That's why I serve him. That's why I don't have a problem serving him. That's why I love him and I don't have a problem telling people that I love God. I serve God. I serve a real and a living God. &gt;&gt; See, after that, you can have a testimony. People don't have to wonder and you don't have to question it because you you're standing on something that's greater than you ever imagined. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, when you come to that place, you can you can you're able to witness. You're able to tell somebody else cuz you understand what you're standing on. You're not afraid to go out and tell somebody, "Hey, there's a real God. There's a Jesus that came and died for my sins, that died for your sins, that died on a cross and shed his blood." &gt;&gt; See, that's the God that I serve. &gt;&gt; I said, "When you understand what you're standing on, you can have victory. &gt;&gt; You can have power. You can have faith. You can you can you can go in there with confidence. Not if your confidence and your ability, nor anything that you can do, but believe in the God that's inside of you will bring you through anything that you may go through. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, it's not anything we could have done. Not anything we could have said, but God chose us before the foundation of the world. He saw our end from the beginning and realized, you know what? That's going to be my son. That's going to be my daughter. That's going to be my king. That's going to be my prince. That's going to be my queen. That's he decided that before the foundation of the world. And when you realize it, you can stand on that foundation &gt;&gt; and you can be uplifted out of the things that you may be going through. You can come out of it. You can open your eyes. Just like God opened the eyes of the servant to see that God was all around him. Even though the enemy was closer to him, God was still out there. He was all around the enemy. And there wasn't nothing the enemy could do about it. is is is mindful that God opened his eyes and when he gave Elijah and them deliverance, he told Elijah to go out there and he blinded each one of their eyes. He blinded the enemy's eyes and Elijah let him down. I believe the story went he led him down to another city and he put all and he put the enemy right in the middle of all the all of God's people and then he opened their eyes and they saw that they were surrounded. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then at that point, they didn't kill him. They they said, "You know what? We we we want peace now." And see, sometimes the Lord has to open your eyes and realize what you're going through is just a moment. And when you are able to see, &gt;&gt; when you're able to see, the devil realized that now you can see, he leaves you alone. &gt;&gt; It wasn't nothing. It wasn't that it it wasn't even the the devil said, "You know what? I was only bothering them because they couldn't see. God only allowed you to go through it because you couldn't see. That he was trying to get you to open your eyes that you may see that what what you're going through is not greater than me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That what you're going through is not greater than me. And once you realize that that and your eyes become open that oh I got it now. It becomes a revelation to you. It's something that hey, nobody can take from you now. No matter how many people told Buddy Ryan that he was he couldn't see, there wasn't nothing that anybody could tell him because he stood on it. &gt;&gt; He realized that this is something that I stand on. It became a revelation to him. And when something becomes a revelation to you, no matter how many people try to talk you out of it, they can't tell you nothing different. That's right. &gt;&gt; No matter how much it may seem to you that things are going in the opposite direction of what you confess, doesn't mean that your confession doesn't hold weight. It doesn't mean that what you confess is not going to happen. All you have to do is continue to stand on it and stand on it. And when those that that don't believe, if it's God's word, you can stand on it. And you can keep standing on it. And you can keep standing on it because that's a foundation that'll never crumble. That's a foundation that'll never move. That's a foundation that'll stay in firm through the end of times. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and it's something that if God's word go out of his mouth, it can't return into him void. &gt;&gt; I said once you realize what you're standing on and the and the thing that you're standing on is the word that he gave you. If you're standing on that word, there's nothing that can move you. &gt;&gt; And you can believe in that word and stand firm on that word until the end of time. Whether you go in the ground or whether he takes us out of here, you can stand on that word and realize that's the only source of truth that's out there. It's the only thing that'll give you the source of truth that you might be looking for. And you search for and people search all their lives trying to find one thing that they can stand on. But when you stand on the word of God, you realize there's nothing that can defeat you. There's nothing that'll come against you that you can't overcome. There's nothing that will come before you that God won't give you victory over. There's nothing that that'll stand in your way. &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord. &gt;&gt; And God God used those things to for you to be a testimony. He'll use those things that give you gifts and give you callings and allow you to be a testament that you know there is a real and a living God. Just like the woman at the well when something happened inside of her and she got a she got on that on that firm foundation that it became a revelation that she said come see a man that told me all that I was see when when she got that revelation that this was this was the living God and she she ran back and told everyone and it wasn't anything it wasn't the words that she said but people saw and knew that something had changed. It wasn't necessarily the words that she said, but she said it and she was a living, walking, breathing testimony of what God can do. &gt;&gt; And said, when you understand the foundation that you're standing on, the confidence that you can have is totally different. You walk into things and you realize that things are not as big as they seem. Things are not as grand as they seem. This is only a test that I'm going through. And when I get through it, it might be another one and another one. But God that brought me through this one's going to take me through that one. And then when I get through that one, he's going to take me through that one. As long as I live, I'm going to have tests and trials. But the key is I understand what I'm standing on. I understand the foundation that I'm standing on. I understand that God is a God that is able to do exceedingly abundantly more than I ask or think. And when I get on there and I realize that I can come through it, I can shout the victory through it. I can walk through it. And I can say, Lord, to God be the glory for all the things that he's done. Lord, I can say to God be the glory that he delivered me, that he gave me victory. That the things that the devil tried to put on me, I didn't accept them, I sent them back. And the things that he tried to give me, I sent them back to him.
