[30:08] [Music]
[30:10] amen amen if you have your Bibles you
[30:13] ask you turn to the Book of Luke Luke
[30:15] Chapter
[30:23] 2 I think it's verse
[30:26] 25
[30:44] if you got it say
[30:50] amen amen and it reads and behold there
[30:54] was a man in Jerusalem whose name was
[30:56] Simeon and the same man was uh was just
[31:00] in the vout waiting for the consolation
[31:02] of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon
[31:05] him and it was revealed unto him by the
[31:08] holy ghost that he should not see death
[31:11] before he had seen the Lord's Christ and
[31:14] he came by the spirit into the temple
[31:17] and when the parents brought in the
[31:19] Child Jesus to do for him after the
[31:22] custom of the law then took he him up in
[31:25] his arms and blessed God and said Lord
[31:28] now let us thou thy servant depart in
[31:32] peace according to Thy word for my eyes
[31:35] have seen thy salvation which thou H has
[31:38] prepared before the face of all the
[31:40] people and a light to lighten the
[31:43] Gentiles and a glory to thy People
[31:45] Israel and Joseph and his mother
[31:47] marveled at these things which were
[31:50] spoken of him and Simeon blessed him and
[31:52] said unto Mary his mother behold this
[31:56] child is set for the the fall and Rising
[31:58] again of many in Israel and for a sign
[32:01] which was spoken against ye a sword
[32:03] shall pierce through his own soul also
[32:06] and that thou and that the thoughts of
[32:09] many hearts may be revealed amen God
[32:12] bless the readings of the word you may
[32:14] be
[32:17] seated amen tonight I'd like to speak on
[32:20] a little topic that I entitled
[32:23] expectations expectations and you look
[32:26] in the word of God and you see that
[32:28] Simeon he wasn't just waiting on a
[32:31] promise that God had given him he was
[32:33] expecting something he was expecting
[32:36] that one day he was going to see the God
[32:38] that was going to be of Salvation And so
[32:41] Simeon he got there and it was not only
[32:43] told to him it was it was something that
[32:46] he knew down in the inside in the inside
[32:49] of him that he knew was true it wasn't
[32:52] something that somebody had told him it
[32:54] was something that he believed in see
[32:56] when you believe in something you know
[32:58] that it's true it doesn't matter if
[33:00] somebody told you or not you can expect
[33:03] and know that it's true
[33:08] said he said now one thing that I read
[33:10] and said now look at Simeon he said now
[33:13] he had to believe something more than
[33:15] you believe cuz you think about what
[33:18] Simeon was going through Simeon was
[33:19] believing something that he didn't even
[33:21] know was true he had no experience of
[33:24] what was going to happen there was no
[33:26] thing it was just written down he had no
[33:30] expectation to go back and read it and
[33:31] see that it happened he had to believe
[33:34] something more than we believe cuz he
[33:36] had to believe in the impossible he had
[33:38] to believe in the unexpected and see he
[33:41] had an expectation that what he believe
[33:43] was going to come to pass he had an
[33:45] expectation that I could set and say I
[33:47] can believe that this is going to happen
[33:49] because the Lord spoke to me because the
[33:52] Lord spoke to me I can believe that it's
[33:54] going to happen I can take it by faith
[33:56] and go go on with it and
[34:00] said he said now can you do that he said
[34:03] now the same holy ghost that led Simeon
[34:06] is the same Holy Ghost that's here
[34:08] tonight there's not two Holy Spirits are
[34:10] there there's just one Holy Spirit see
[34:13] this the same God that's doing things
[34:15] over and over again to prove to you and
[34:17] I that he's still God said I can go to
[34:20] God and I can expect God to do what he
[34:22] said he would do cuz he said he's the
[34:25] same yesterday today and forever
[34:27] he said he's the same God that can do
[34:29] the impossible said now they're getting
[34:32] healed but Jesus Christ so Christ had
[34:34] never come to Earth see Simeon had
[34:36] believed in a God that he had never seen
[34:39] he had to believe in a God that that
[34:41] only had spoke to him he said Jesus
[34:43] hadn't even come to Earth yet and still
[34:45] Simeon was waiting on God to be revealed
[34:47] to him he was still waiting there and I
[34:50] thought about it I said you know it
[34:52] wasn't just him waiting he was in the
[34:54] right place he wasn't waiting here there
[34:57] in the field he was in the right place
[34:59] when he was waiting on God to show up he
[35:01] was in the right place and not only that
[35:03] he was expecting God but he was doing
[35:06] something he was doing something while
[35:08] he was expecting God he might have been
[35:10] reading he might have been praying he
[35:11] might have been studying but he was
[35:13] doing something he was about his
[35:15] father's business said you might not
[35:17] know what may happen but you can always
[35:20] be about your father's business you can
[35:22] always go and you can ask God lord what
[35:24] would you have me to do Lord what would
[35:26] you you have me to do he said Simeon but
[35:29] it was prophesied that he would come see
[35:31] Simeon believed in a prophecy he
[35:33] believed that that Jesus was going to
[35:35] come and Simeon had the promise of the
[35:38] Holy Ghost that he was going to see him
[35:40] said Simeon knew that he was going to
[35:42] see
[35:43] him said now go all God always had
[35:47] someone that believed his word God
[35:50] always had someone that believed his
[35:52] word amen are you a Believer tonight
[35:55] amen are you a Believer tonight amen
[35:56] amen so somebody's going to expect God
[35:59] to fulfill his words while other pass it
[36:02] by now it was in that day so it is now
[36:05] the church has gotten formal and gotten
[36:07] away from God so we look into the world
[36:09] today and we can see many things
[36:11] happening in church many things that we
[36:14] might not have thought or expected but
[36:16] they're happening in church but it says
[36:19] somebody's going to expect God to
[36:21] fulfill his word somebody's going to
[36:23] have an expectation that God will do
[36:25] what he said he would do said somebody's
[36:27] going to have have an expectation that
[36:29] God is going to come judge his people
[36:31] cuz God he whipped them out of the
[36:33] temple when they were doing wrong in his
[36:35] house see they going to have an
[36:36] expectation that God is going to set
[36:38] things right God is going to do a work
[36:41] and then nobody can say it was him or it
[36:43] was them it was only God that did it cuz
[36:46] God knows the thoughts and the intents
[36:48] of the heart see God you got to have an
[36:50] expectation that God knows what he's
[36:52] doing God knows what he's doing and if
[36:55] you expect God to do something he'll do
[36:57] it if you expect God and I was reading
[37:00] that you must believe that all things
[37:02] are possible to him that believes but be
[37:06] expecting God to deliver you for he
[37:09] promised it and as soon as your faith
[37:12] can catch up it's gone away as soon as
[37:15] your faith can catch up to what you
[37:17] believe and you don't doubt it it'll
[37:19] it'll go away and and that's right and
[37:22] now whatever you expect that's what God
[37:25] will do amen whatever you expect it's
[37:28] not what mother or sister or brother
[37:30] expect it's what you expect whatever you
[37:33] expect that's what God will do see I can
[37:36] stand on that whatever I expect that's
[37:39] what God will do see I expect God to
[37:41] move in my life so I'm going to watch
[37:43] him do it all I got to do is expect God
[37:46] to do it and he will show up it may not
[37:48] be when you want it but he'll be right
[37:50] on time said whatever you expect that's
[37:53] what God will
[37:55] do said
[37:57] said be expecting God to deliver you for
[37:59] he promised it and as soon as your faith
[38:02] catch it can catch up it's going away
[38:05] said see you got to believe in what you
[38:07] expect God to do you got to have faith
[38:10] and not doubt cuz he said if you have
[38:12] the faith of a mustard seed it can move
[38:14] mountains say how many mountains have
[38:17] you moved with your faith if you have
[38:19] faith of a mustard SE it'll move
[38:22] mountains how many mountains have you
[38:24] moved with the faith in your life said
[38:27] God re will reveal himself to those who
[38:30] are expecting him how many are expecting
[38:33] him tonight said God will reveal himself
[38:36] to those that are expecting him and you
[38:39] look in the Bible and you remember when
[38:41] Jesus was born that there was the Magi
[38:43] that were out and said the Magi they
[38:45] were expecting to see the star of Jacob
[38:48] rise there were many people out there
[38:51] but they was expecting that star to show
[38:53] up they was searching they was watching
[38:55] the skies they was expecting in that
[38:57] star to show up and they were from the
[38:59] East and they listened to Bam's prophecy
[39:02] which said there would be a star of
[39:03] Jacob rise and they were looking for it
[39:06] there was they were expecting it and
[39:09] they were the ones who saw it see not
[39:12] everybody saw that star but they were
[39:15] expecting it and they saw it so
[39:17] everybody might not see Jesus but if you
[39:20] are expecting you'll see him if you are
[39:23] expecting God then you'll see him if you
[39:25] are looking in the right right place and
[39:27] you're in the right place you'll see God
[39:29] cuz you're expecting him to be there he
[39:31] said when two or three are gathered in
[39:33] my name there I'll be in the midst so
[39:36] when you come into the house of God you
[39:38] should expect God to be there cuz he
[39:40] said I will be in the midst he said I
[39:42] will be in the midst so you can expect
[39:45] God to be there but it's according to
[39:47] what you expect I was reading something
[39:50] and it said you know if you were looking
[39:51] for a fault you the devil surely show it
[39:54] to you the devil surely to you but
[39:57] that's what you expected when you walked
[39:59] in the door you expected to find
[40:01] something to be wrong but if you were
[40:03] expecting God to show up he'll meet you
[40:06] there if you expecting God to do
[40:08] something he'll meet you there if you
[40:10] were expecting God to move in your life
[40:12] he'll meet you there you were expecting
[40:14] God to heal you he'll heal you you were
[40:16] expecting God to deliver you he'll
[40:18] deliver you because it's whatever you
[40:20] expect it's not what your mother your
[40:22] sister or brother what you expect so you
[40:24] got to show up with an expectation that
[40:26] Lord I need something from you Lord I
[40:29] need you to move in my life Lord I may
[40:31] need a healing and Lord I'm expecting
[40:33] you to heal me Lord cuz you said by your
[40:36] strikes we are heal so it's already done
[40:39] but I'm expecting to see the
[40:40] manifestation of your word in my life
[40:43] and my body and my home and my family
[40:45] Lord I'm expecting and that I know that
[40:48] you'll show up and do what you said you
[40:50] would
[40:51] do it said and how and how many tonight
[40:55] expecting to be healed
[40:57] see let's see your hands and said well
[40:59] you're not going to be disappointed cuz
[41:01] if you you just can't be dis
[41:03] disappointed if you're expecting it said
[41:06] you're not going to be disappointed
[41:09] then if you just can't be disappointed
[41:12] if you're expecting it if you're not
[41:14] expecting it then you say well I'll wa
[41:17] maybe tomorrow afternoon I'll get it
[41:19] tomorrow well that's when you'll get it
[41:22] so whenever you expect it that's when
[41:24] you'll get it so if you going to take
[41:27] that test and you expecting to maybe get
[41:29] a beat guess what you going to get you
[41:31] going to get that beat you probably
[41:33] should have asked God to do give you an
[41:35] A and you probably would have got it
[41:36] because it was given to you for what you
[41:39] expected not for what anybody else
[41:41] expected what you expected God said I
[41:44] can do all
[41:45] things he there ain't no limitations on
[41:48] what he can do he said now now you got
[41:50] to put in the work and study now he
[41:53] ain't say just show
[41:55] up he he said you got to do something in
[41:57] order to get it but once you do it you
[42:00] can expect God to show up and and fill
[42:03] in the gaps where you might be
[42:05] missing say Jesus said according to your
[42:09] faith be it unto you according to your
[42:12] faith said some sometimes you look and
[42:15] you say why isn't things happening but
[42:17] it's according to your faith it's what
[42:20] you're expecting is what when you walk
[42:22] in do you believe that God is going to
[42:24] do for you say everybody some people may
[42:27] feel the Lord and may be in a you say
[42:29] you come to service you see sister so
[42:31] and so oh the Lord really touched her oh
[42:34] the brother so and so the Lord really
[42:36] touched him and then you looking around
[42:38] and say Lord why didn't you touch me and
[42:40] the Lord said what did you
[42:41] expect what did you expect you just
[42:44] showed up and said I'm going to church
[42:46] tonight and you came and plop down on
[42:48] the Pew and you didn't expect God to do
[42:50] nothing for you so what God what should
[42:53] God do for you your expectation is so
[42:55] low that God said H okay I guess you
[42:58] didn't really care I guess you didn't
[43:00] really want nothing so he'll let you go
[43:02] on but it's sometimes you got to elevate
[43:05] your faith it's according to your faith
[43:07] it's not according to the preacher's
[43:09] faith and sometimes you may get in the
[43:11] prayer line and and get prayed for and
[43:13] say why am I not healed it's according
[43:15] to your faith said the preacher doesn't
[43:18] give you healing but one day when your
[43:20] faith catches up to what you expect
[43:23] things will happen for you things will
[43:24] move in your life that you might not
[43:26] have done thought and God can do
[43:28] exceedingly abundantly more than you can
[43:30] ask or think but it's what you expect
[43:33] it's according to your
[43:35] faith he said Simeon he said could you
[43:38] imagine Simeon was there and could you
[43:40] imagine some of those Scholars said
[43:41] don't pay no attention to the old fell I
[43:44] believe he's just he's got old now and
[43:47] his Minds kindly went away from him said
[43:50] you know Simeon was over there maybe for
[43:51] years and years waiting on this child to
[43:54] show up he you might have seen hundreds
[43:57] of thousands of children be born and
[44:00] come to that Temple but he was still
[44:02] waiting cuz there was nothing there that
[44:05] had told him this was the one there was
[44:07] nothing there he his expectation was
[44:09] still elevated and high because he was
[44:11] waiting on his promise he was waiting on
[44:14] a promise that was delivered unto him it
[44:16] was delivered unto him said people might
[44:19] have picked Adam and said he done got
[44:20] old now and his Minds kindly went away
[44:23] from him and the poor old fell he's a
[44:25] good old man but you know old man like
[44:28] that isn't going to why you looked at
[44:30] him for age and looked at the condition
[44:32] of the world today why why we know he
[44:35] isn't coming now said they might have
[44:37] looked around and said you know he going
[44:39] to pass away before he see this you see
[44:42] how old he is you can imagine you know
[44:45] sometimes when you see an elderly person
[44:47] sometimes you
[44:48] say okay and they tell you something you
[44:51] know the Lord is soon to come the Lord
[44:54] is soon to come like sister Oar told us
[44:57] every day the Lord is soon to come but
[44:59] you know sometimes you get away from
[45:01] that expectation that the Lord is soon
[45:03] to come because you're living life
[45:05] you're doing things and time is passing
[45:08] and you look back and you say they've
[45:10] been saying that all my life the Lord is
[45:11] soon to come all my life I've been
[45:14] hearing that the Lord's coming soon but
[45:16] say you know what you won't be in the
[45:18] right place if you don't expect him to
[45:20] come you won't be in the right condition
[45:23] if you don't expect him to come you
[45:25] won't be ready when he comes if you're
[45:28] not expecting him to come so sometimes
[45:30] you got to get ready before the thing
[45:33] happens to you see Simeon wasn't out
[45:35] plying the field he was in the place to
[45:37] meet where the Messiah was going to be
[45:39] he was exactly where he was told to be
[45:41] because he knew that one day he was
[45:43] coming it might have been 10 15 20 30 45
[45:47] years before he seen him but he was in
[45:49] the right place to see him said but if
[45:52] you're not expecting God to come back
[45:54] then you conduct your life you may
[45:56] conduct it a certain way you might not
[45:58] have no urgency to your life you might
[46:01] not be urgent to you know I got to get
[46:04] to the house of the Lord cuz you know
[46:06] one day they said we won't get to go but
[46:08] you see you're just living because
[46:09] you've been hearing things all your life
[46:12] but one day if they do happen then you
[46:14] say well then you're going to try to
[46:16] catch up but it might be too
[46:19] late so what are you
[46:22] expecting say you got to set your
[46:24] expectation some sometimes times in in
[46:26] life you change your
[46:28] expectations you might have set a goal
[46:30] and said you know what this month I want
[46:32] to save this much well when you hit your
[46:35] goal the next month you said well I can
[46:37] do that and maybe a little bit more so
[46:39] you change your
[46:41] expectation sometimes you got to update
[46:43] your expectations and and as the world
[46:46] grows and things are going on sometimes
[46:48] you got to re-evaluate what am I
[46:50] expecting I got to re-evaluate when I go
[46:53] to the house of the Lord what am I
[46:54] expecting am I expecting it to be like
[46:57] it was the last time sometimes we get
[47:00] that mindset you
[47:01] know I don't want
[47:04] to well I
[47:06] guess and then sometimes you got to come
[47:08] and say Lord It's not according to them
[47:10] and it's according to my faith say I can
[47:13] be the one lick of fire that calls God
[47:15] on the scene I can be that one lick of
[47:18] fire that catches the rest of everyone
[47:20] on fire but it where does it start it
[47:22] starts with you it starts with me it
[47:25] starts with with the person from the
[47:26] back door to the front door but each and
[47:28] every one of us you can Elevate somebody
[47:32] you can take it and say Lord take this
[47:34] fire that's in me and Lord let it burn
[47:36] and Lord let it not be hidden but Lord
[47:39] you may come and let it grow Lord
[47:41] breathe the Breath of Life onto this
[47:43] breath of on this little liquor Fire
[47:45] Lord and let it grow so it'll shine more
[47:48] for you it'll shine brighter for you and
[47:51] said they were looking at Simeon and his
[47:53] age and they looked at the condition
[47:55] they said he uh he's still saying that
[47:58] he going to see it but said Simon had
[48:00] one reason that he believed said the
[48:03] Holy Ghost had revealed it to him
[48:05] sometimes you may go to church but it
[48:07] ain't till it come revealed to you that
[48:10] you don't understand said when you when
[48:12] it's revealed to you that Jesus is soon
[48:14] to come oh you take off with a world of
[48:17] fire behind you you said Lord I got to
[48:19] get right Lord I got to get ready cuz
[48:22] you're soon to come and when it clicks
[48:24] to you one day you say oh all this don't
[48:27] matter none of this right here matter
[48:29] and this one talking and that one it
[48:31] don't matter cuz Jesus is soon to come
[48:34] said sister o she said it every day
[48:36] Jesus is soon to come that's all she had
[48:38] to say but she said that Jesus was soon
[48:41] to come because it was revealed to her
[48:44] it was something that was deep down on
[48:45] the inside that she knew beyond the
[48:47] Shadow of Doubt that God was soon to
[48:50] come that sometimes you got to set your
[48:52] expectation Lord I know that you're
[48:54] coming so Lord help help me get ready
[48:56] Lord I don't want to in that moment I
[48:58] don't want to be getting ready I want to
[49:00] be ready but if this is my day to get
[49:02] ready Lord get me ready cuz Lord I don't
[49:05] want nothing stopping me I don't want
[49:07] nothing hindering me I don't want
[49:09] nothing that I'm thinking in my mind to
[49:11] stop me Lord from going over lord I
[49:14] don't want to be looking at this one or
[49:15] that one Lord I got too much to worry
[49:17] about myself Lord I can look in my own
[49:20] life and say Lord I need help Lord I'm
[49:22] expecting you to do a work in my life
[49:25] see it's according to your
[49:27] faith he said he Simon but Simon had one
[49:31] reason that he believed that is the Holy
[49:34] Ghost had revealed it to him there's the
[49:36] thing God had told Simon that he wasn't
[49:39] going to see death until he had seen the
[49:41] Christ he wasn't going to see that see
[49:44] Simon had an expectation that it's the
[49:47] Simeon he had an
[49:49] expectation that he that God was going
[49:51] to do what he said he would do Simeon
[49:54] had an expectation that he was going to
[49:57] that God was going to do what he said he
[49:58] going to do and and Simeon believed in
[50:01] it there was no doubt that this was
[50:04] going to happen cuz if he had doubt he
[50:06] probably would have left a long time ago
[50:08] those that believ for a season when the
[50:11] opportunities change they go after
[50:13] opportunity but when it's revealed to
[50:15] him so deeply and so strong he stayed in
[50:18] his place and stayed in his position
[50:20] until he saw the Lord until he saw the
[50:23] Lord and he believed that what the Holy
[50:26] Ghost said was the
[50:28] truth said he believed that what the
[50:30] Holy Ghost said was the truth say Simeon
[50:33] he had changed Simeon he might have been
[50:35] living life but when that was revealed
[50:37] to him he changed his expectation he
[50:40] changed what he was expecting God to do
[50:42] he changed what he was walking in and
[50:44] going in and in his path of Life maybe
[50:47] and he changed and said I got to go to
[50:49] that one place cuz I know right there
[50:51] that's where I'm going to see him and he
[50:53] might have stayed there for years but he
[50:56] said I got to stay here until I see what
[50:58] God promised me said sometimes you may
[51:01] go left or right but sometimes you got
[51:03] to stand still and know that he is God
[51:06] you got to stand still and know that
[51:08] he's the same God you got to stand still
[51:10] and know that he can do the the things
[51:13] that you asked him to do cuz he's the
[51:16] same God I said in the old church before
[51:18] we came over here I said we used to have
[51:21] something on the on the wall behind the
[51:23] pull pit anybody remember what it said
[51:27] it said expect the
[51:28] supernatural says sometimes we got to go
[51:31] back to expecting God to do the
[51:33] supernatural so we got to go back to
[51:36] expecting God to do the Supernatural cuz
[51:39] he's the same God he didn't change he
[51:42] didn't change so what's the difference
[51:45] it's what we expect from God to do see
[51:48] he's the same God and it's what we
[51:50] expect God to do said I wrote down I
[51:53] said all we expect in the L Lord Lord to
[51:56] return and if you are what are you doing
[51:59] to prepare yourself for his
[52:01] coming and said what about those that
[52:04] are around you says sometimes you you
[52:06] don't go witness him because because you
[52:09] don't think the Lord is soon to
[52:11] come your expectation is that's far down
[52:14] the line but what if he came tonight
[52:17] would you be
[52:19] ready if he came tonight would you be
[52:21] ready said that you look down and he
[52:24] said you may not know the day or the
[52:26] hour but you can know the season say
[52:29] said that sometimes it said what are you
[52:31] expecting from God what are you
[52:34] expecting of the Lord you can see the
[52:36] signs of the time and you might think
[52:38] that it's we still got time but what are
[52:41] you doing to prepare yourself for it's
[52:44] coming excuse me said none of us are too
[52:48] old or too young for God not to for God
[52:52] not to move in our lives say God can
[52:54] move in your life no matter what age you
[52:56] are God can come down and all it takes
[52:59] is you getting down and say Lord I need
[53:01] your help Lord I I'm expecting something
[53:04] from you Lord I'm expecting you to move
[53:07] in my life you don't know what that may
[53:09] do for the people that are around you to
[53:11] see you crying out and say Lord I need
[53:13] you I need you I don't need someone and
[53:17] it may be all alone in the lonely night
[53:20] and all the lonely hours God sees those
[53:23] things God said he captures the tears
[53:26] that you cry see God hears every prayer
[53:29] but you got to believe and you got to
[53:30] have faith that what you ask God to do
[53:33] he'll do it said set your expectation on
[53:37] what you ask God to do and he'll do it
[53:40] said you can expect the impossible
[53:42] because he's the god of the impossible
[53:45] said said I expect God to do things but
[53:49] do I hold on to what I expect God to do
[53:52] do I hold on and I stand firm on on what
[53:55] I expect God to
[53:57] do cuz if you expect healing he'll heal
[53:59] you he said when your faith catches up
[54:02] then it'll be gone just like that and I
[54:05] believe that God will do the things he
[54:07] can if he held up a plane to meet a
[54:10] mother's prayer what can he do for you
[54:13] if he if he went down and he can heal
[54:15] the blind eyes what can he do for you if
[54:18] he can raise the dead what can he do for
[54:20] you I said none of us are dead in here
[54:23] today so what else can he do for you if
[54:26] you got life health and strength that's
[54:27] more reason to expect God to do more cuz
[54:31] he is able to do exceedingly and more
[54:33] than we ask or think so sometimes we
[54:35] have not because we ask not and when we
[54:38] ask we ask a Miss but Lord I'm expecting
[54:41] you to do what your word said you would
[54:43] do Lord I'm expecting you to show up cuz
[54:45] you said in your word that you would
[54:47] show up Lord I'm expecting you to move
[54:49] because you said in your word you would
[54:51] move Lord you gave us examples that I
[54:53] can believe and have faith that Lord
[54:55] you're going to do exactly what you said
[54:57] you would do cuz that's what I expect of
[54:59] you God and you said your word cannot
[55:02] return unto you void and said he's a God
[55:04] and I change not so if he can't change
[55:07] then I can keep expecting if he can't if
[55:09] he don't change then I can keep
[55:11] believing I can have faith that God will
[55:13] do exceedingly and more and more and
[55:15] that each and every day he can take me
[55:17] higher and I can believe more each and
[55:20] every day I might only have the faith of
[55:22] a mustard seed but if I keep believing
[55:24] it'll grow if I keep believing it'll
[55:27] grow next long I ain't got no Mustard
[55:29] Seed Faith I got a stalk Faith a little
[55:32] plant start to grow next thing I know I
[55:34] turn around and I keep believing and I
[55:36] keep believing next thing I know I got a
[55:38] little tree forming and it's growing and
[55:41] it's getting taller not only is it
[55:43] getting taller it's getting stronger and
[55:45] now I'm starting to believe God to do
[55:47] more and I turn around and there's some
[55:49] leaves forming on the tree next thing I
[55:51] know there's some branches forming on
[55:53] the tree and this tree is getting
[55:55] stronger it's growing higher and it's
[55:57] growing taller next thing I know I'm I
[55:59] can put barely put my fingers around it
[56:01] and see my faith is growing because I'm
[56:03] watching what God is doing in this tree
[56:06] I'm watching how God is moving and
[56:07] growing this and say it's just that
[56:09] small you look at the oak tree and you
[56:12] don't see the acorn but it was
[56:14] there and you look at it and say Lord I
[56:17] can expect it because all it takes is a
[56:19] little faith to move mountains it don't
[56:22] take much it take a little faith to move
[56:24] mountains
[56:25] so Lord if I can expect with my little
[56:27] bit of Faith Lord Jesus with my little
[56:30] bit of Faith what can he do for me if I
[56:33] can expect with maybe my little bit of
[56:35] meal and my little bit of oil what can
[56:38] he do for me he supplied it all through
[56:40] the whole drought season but what could
[56:43] he do he sent a he sent a prophet to
[56:45] come by just because of a little bit of
[56:47] Faith with a little bit of meal and a
[56:50] little bit of oil he said that's all
[56:52] that God needs he don't need you to come
[56:54] and make drastic changes God will do all
[56:56] the changing all you got to do is
[56:59] believe he don't expect you to go from
[57:01] night to day God to do all that for you
[57:04] all you got to do is believe that he is
[57:06] God and that he can't and they don't
[57:07] change and he can do that in your life
[57:10] that's all you have to do but you got to
[57:12] expect God to do it you got to expect
[57:15] God to do it you won't get what you
[57:17] don't expect you won't get what you
[57:20] don't expect because God is the god that
[57:22] he just wants you to have a little faith
[57:24] that I and then he then he can turn
[57:26] around and you may look and say I told
[57:28] you I would do it cuz that's the god
[57:31] that you serve that's the god that we
[57:33] serve I said I got to expect more from
[57:36] God I got to expect you can expect God
[57:39] to fill you with the Holy Ghost CU
[57:42] that's what he promised you but you got
[57:44] to expect the god to do it first you got
[57:47] to believe and be saved and be baptized
[57:50] and then he said the gift is that you
[57:52] shall receive the Holy Ghost but see
[57:54] whatever ever you expect that's what
[57:55] you'll get whatever you expect so if you
[57:58] don't expect it you'll never get it but
[58:01] in in this day and age you got to expect
[58:03] God to do CU you don't know what tests
[58:05] and trials may come your way you don't
[58:08] know what God may put in your life to
[58:10] prove that he is God but sometimes you
[58:13] got to expect that he's the same God
[58:15] that can move mountains he's the same
[58:17] God that can stop the Sun and stop time
[58:21] he's the same God that heals and
[58:23] delivers because Lord it's whatever I'm
[58:25] expecting you to do I can believe that
[58:28] you you'll do it
[58:30] [Applause]
[58:41] amen praise God Amen what are you
[58:45] expecting

[59:40] you know I was sitting there rejoicing
[59:42] brother because I just preached that
[59:44] message last
[59:46] Sunday I knew it was the Holy Ghost you
[59:50] know I kept put brother Simms kept
[59:51] coming on my heart and uh I was riding
[59:54] now then and uh I stopped and a little
[59:57] light flashed up on my truck and I said
[1:00:00] Lord now I know you spoke to my heart
[1:00:03] and I said if this light is on then I
[1:00:05] need to on on and turn around so I got
[1:00:07] there and I pulled out my book and see
[1:00:09] what it the problem might have been and
[1:00:11] uh I went in the store and then I came
[1:00:14] back and I fired the truck up and uh got
[1:00:17] there and you know it's light was out so
[1:00:21] when the light went out so I know the
[1:00:22] Lord wanted me to keep coming and then
[1:00:25] you know he met me back there and uh I
[1:00:28] knew uh right now that it wasn't a time
[1:00:30] but I knew the Lord was leading me here
[1:00:32] at this specific time uh you know but
[1:00:35] not not over preaching the what he
[1:00:37] preached but expectation is a great
[1:00:39] thing you know you're talking about when
[1:00:42] you come into the house of the Lord we
[1:00:44] the only one know that the impossible is
[1:00:47] possible is that right so we come
[1:00:50] expecting great things he told us to ask
[1:00:53] and ask abundant abundantly is that
[1:00:55] right you know when you come into the
[1:00:57] house of the Lord we got to realize in
[1:01:00] this age here now that we're just the
[1:01:02] bride of Christ and brother forgive me
[1:01:05] cu the anointing don't drop down in here
[1:01:07] and you got to understand who you are
[1:01:09] and whatever you ask if my word abide in
[1:01:12] you and you abide in me whatever you ask
[1:01:14] you can receive it is that right you
[1:01:17] know it you know s brother he couldn't
[1:01:19] even go nowhere is that right the Bible
[1:01:22] say he couldn't even go nowhere is that
[1:01:24] right because God had made a promise to
[1:01:27] him and he was an old man at the time he
[1:01:30] took a lot of persecution at the time uh
[1:01:33] but Simeon was it was revealed to him by
[1:01:36] the Holy Ghost uh as the precious
[1:01:38] brother said when you see the young
[1:01:39] ministers rising up and studying the
[1:01:41] message of the hour he's catching a hold
[1:01:44] of it it's not a man is that right it's
[1:01:47] Christ in the Holy Ghost form back on
[1:01:49] the scene again and we got a great God
[1:01:52] we serve a mighty God we serve a
[1:01:54] miraculous God of and what he ask you
[1:01:57] know when you come in the house of the
[1:01:59] Lord is like he said in the old church
[1:02:01] you got to expect the Supernatural is
[1:02:04] that right you see it in the mirror
[1:02:06] every day when you wake up it's in us we
[1:02:09] see the body changes is that right we
[1:02:11] see him changing us we don't appear to
[1:02:13] be anything right now but the Bible say
[1:02:16] we're going to be just like him but you
[1:02:18] know when the man sat in the gates
[1:02:20] called Beautiful he sat there for 40
[1:02:23] years is that right brother Kaleb he
[1:02:25] said he was expecting that right he got
[1:02:28] to the to the point where his faith was
[1:02:30] so low all he was expecting was money is
[1:02:34] that right arms when he sat in the gate
[1:02:36] but the gates of beautiful men it was an
[1:02:38] appointed time uh and that a point in
[1:02:41] time when Peter and John saw him at the
[1:02:43] gate he forgot about in the house of the
[1:02:46] Lord his salvation he forgot about the
[1:02:49] house of the Lord it was Deliverance he
[1:02:51] forgot about in the house of the Lord it
[1:02:53] was healing he was gaed about in the
[1:02:55] house of the Lord it was Miracles they
[1:02:58] come and don't make it just a tradition
