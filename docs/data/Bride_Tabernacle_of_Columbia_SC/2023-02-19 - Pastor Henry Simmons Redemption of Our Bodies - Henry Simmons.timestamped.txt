[36:00] The Book of Romans 8 and 14.
[36:06] Romans 8 and 14.
[36:09] it said I read the first you read the
[36:11] next we read the 23rd verse together God
[36:14] is good amen
[36:16] they said
[36:18] in Kentucky
[36:19] Ashburn College then Revival of the
[36:23] youth to stand around day in and day out
[36:26] people are coming for miles around
[36:28] they're in Revival at the college there
[36:32] and um they're praying night and day
[36:36] and has moved there and my wife's just
[36:39] telling me that I knew her
[36:42] I saw the winner about Kentucky but she
[36:44] says there's one going on in Ohio to
[36:46] Utah
[36:47] in Revival there and then it's another
[36:50] place on another college campus about
[36:53] three college campuses
[36:55] they're coming from all over they're
[36:57] praying night and day
[36:59] I said if they're doing this
[37:02] praise God then where's the bride
[37:04] Revival
[37:06] are you
[37:08] the young people are stirred there
[37:10] God is moving amen
[37:15] Romans
[37:17] 8 and 14 and I read the first year
[37:20] reading the next
[37:22] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[37:24] God they are the sons of God 15.
[37:36] a spirit itself that Witness
[37:38] with our spirits
[37:40] that we are the children of God 17.
[37:57] for I reckon that the suffering of this
[37:59] present time are not worthy to be
[38:01] compared with the glory that shall be
[38:03] revealed in US 19.
[38:11] for the creature was made subject to
[38:15] vanity not willing but by reason of the
[38:18] same who has subjected the same in Hope
[38:22] 21.
[38:33] for we know that the whole creation
[38:36] groanings and travail in pain together
[38:40] until now together and not only they but
[38:44] we ourselves also which have the first
[38:47] fruit of the spirit even we ourselves
[38:51] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[38:54] adoption to the wit the Redemption of
[38:57] our bodies
[38:59] God bless you towards you may be seated
[39:03] this morning I guess we continue in the
[39:06] phase we're talking about the book of
[39:08] redemption we talked about amen the day
[39:11] of redemption we talked the sealed to
[39:15] the day of redemption now we're talking
[39:17] about the Redemption of the body this
[39:19] morning
[39:19] so continually on Redemption Redemption
[39:23] then amen that God frees us from the
[39:27] guilt and the penalty of sin amen
[39:30] the the transgressions amen God sets us
[39:35] free from that
[39:36] he redeems us amen then we talked about
[39:39] the abstract title Dee the book of
[39:42] redemption that God everything that Adam
[39:45] and lost was given back to us amen
[39:48] so everything that out of a loss in the
[39:51] garden and through sin God has restored
[39:54] redeemed us and amen given us made us
[39:57] journales with him Christ
[39:59] amen everything that Christ has we know
[40:02] that as he said
[40:05] servant of God said all that Christ
[40:07] wants he quoted all the God was he put
[40:09] it into Christ and all that Christ was
[40:11] he put it into the church
[40:14] are you with me
[40:16] so we realized that what was lost has
[40:20] been restored
[40:22] are you with me
[40:23] but
[40:25] we'll still we're still dealing with
[40:28] this body amen am I but look like my
[40:32] whole head has turned gray
[40:34] and
[40:36] um look like in this life we still deal
[40:40] with a little bit of pain and trouble
[40:42] and sorrow though we've been redeemed
[40:45] and we've everything has been restored
[40:48] back we've done amen here it says in
[40:52] Romans
[40:53] um 24 for we're saved by hope
[40:57] but hope that is seen
[41:00] is not hope
[41:02] for what a man sees why does he yet hope
[41:07] for
[41:08] but if we hope for that which we see not
[41:14] then we
[41:16] then
[41:17] do we were patient what
[41:21] wait for
[41:23] amen amen
[41:25] so he says likewise the spirit also
[41:28] happened to our infirmity
[41:30] for we know not what we should pray for
[41:34] as we all but the spirit itself make its
[41:37] intercession for us with groans which
[41:40] cannot be uttered
[41:42] and
[41:45] he that searches of the heart knows what
[41:48] is the mind of the spirit because he
[41:51] make an intercession for the Saints
[41:53] according to the will of what
[41:56] will of God
[41:58] and
[42:00] we know
[42:02] that all what
[42:05] we work together for what good to them
[42:08] that
[42:10] love God to to them who are the what
[42:14] who are the call according to
[42:18] purpose for whom he did for knowing he
[42:23] also did
[42:25] to be conformed to
[42:28] image of his son that he might
[42:32] be the firstborn or what
[42:34] my many brethren
[42:37] amen it says over whom he did
[42:41] predestinate them he also
[42:44] and whom he called them he also
[42:48] and whom he justified them he
[42:51] glorify
[42:54] amen God is good isn't that right
[42:57] we're serving a good God and when I talk
[43:00] about uh the Redemption of the body amen
[43:05] we know that
[43:07] our souls amen God has given us of his
[43:12] spirit
[43:13] amen God has given us as as we see you
[43:18] know oftentimes he said let the redeem
[43:20] of the Lord say so
[43:22] that means we identified we did with
[43:25] Redemption we'll we've been redeemed
[43:29] and we know that the blood of Jesus
[43:31] Christ has redeemed us
[43:34] amen we have Redemption to his blood
[43:37] even the forgiveness of sin are you with
[43:40] me through the blood of Jesus Christ our
[43:43] sins have been forgiven
[43:45] now
[43:47] this body is a constantly reminder
[43:51] so as long as we got this uh body and
[43:56] we're in this body then amen we have a
[44:00] reminder amen of of sin and what
[44:05] happened in the penalty in the price
[44:08] and every ache and every pain we feel
[44:12] not only do we feel that in this body
[44:15] but while we're in this body
[44:17] amen though God has fully restored us
[44:22] Amen in what the blood has done it has
[44:26] done the work that was required amen
[44:30] because of justice and because of the
[44:32] penalty of sin the price has been paid
[44:37] but
[44:39] as long as we're in this body
[44:42] we have a constant reminder
[44:45] of what happened in the garden and how
[44:48] what happened to man because of
[44:50] Disobedience to the word
[44:53] amen so because man disobeyed God Amen
[44:58] every time amen every inch every pain
[45:01] every sorrow every death everything to
[45:04] happen is a reminder
[45:07] if man had not sinned
[45:10] we would not have pain
[45:12] will it not have sorrow
[45:15] will not have all this disappointing now
[45:17] we even in our minds
[45:21] there's a wall constantly going on
[45:24] because sin causes corrupt
[45:28] not only Corruption of the body but
[45:31] Corruption of the Mind
[45:34] amen so and
[45:37] until God transformed us our minds also
[45:42] through the blood of Jesus Christ had
[45:44] the the power of trans he said I beseech
[45:48] your brethren by the mercy of God that
[45:50] you want
[45:52] that you won't worthy amen God knew that
[45:57] we would go through something within our
[46:00] spirit and within our minds so we needed
[46:04] our minds transformed he said I beseech
[46:07] your brethren by the mercies of God that
[46:09] you present your bodies a Living
[46:11] Sacrifice why because we're talking
[46:14] about the Redemption of the bodies
[46:16] but he said now that we're in this flesh
[46:19] he said that you present your bodies as
[46:22] a Living Sacrifice why amen this body I
[46:27] don't care when you're born in this
[46:29] world you start dying
[46:34] because why your your days are numbered
[46:39] and your steps even a numbered
[46:43] and when you're born in this world you
[46:45] started you look like you you you're
[46:48] living but you're dying daily
[46:51] Paul said I Die daily
[46:54] I put
[46:55] a
[46:57] I said we're born to die
[47:00] that's why he said a man that was born
[47:01] of a woman a few days and
[47:04] full of trouble so death started working
[47:09] and we'd fight to live
[47:13] because we are in this world we want to
[47:16] live
[47:18] when a baby is born sometimes the baby
[47:21] go through certain sickness and
[47:22] Transitions and things why because
[47:25] debate
[47:27] a mother a father they want a child to
[47:30] live
[47:31] life is valuable it means something
[47:36] yet the body that the hands sometimes
[47:38] traumatized
[47:40] it goes through changes
[47:44] there's all kind of diseases there's all
[47:46] kind of plagues all kind of things that
[47:49] a baby can go through and as we grow in
[47:52] life
[47:54] things just happen
[47:57] it says what he says here
[48:01] that you present your body as a Living
[48:03] Sacrifice so Paul is saying that I want
[48:07] you to come and I want you to give this
[48:10] body that you have as a Living Sacrifice
[48:13] to God
[48:15] he said
[48:17] holy
[48:18] and acceptable to God
[48:21] if you look at your body or you
[48:24] that you are you giving that's a body to
[48:27] God as a Living Sacrifice
[48:33] who are you living for
[48:37] amen are you living for God are you
[48:41] presenting your body as Christians we
[48:43] should present our bodies as a Living
[48:45] Sacrifice knowing that this body here is
[48:48] not the real thingy
[48:51] this body here is a is a product of sin
[48:57] so because it's a product of sin I want
[49:00] to present this body as a Living
[49:02] Sacrifice
[49:04] because God is even though this body
[49:07] amen was born in sin shaping in the
[49:10] nicotine amen God do amen has a a put in
[49:16] this body attraction
[49:19] yeah he said he put a tragic in the
[49:22] Earthly vessels
[49:24] this body houses amen
[49:28] the divine nature
[49:31] it houses amen uh a holy God
[49:37] amen because we have accepted what the
[49:40] blood has done
[49:42] and because of the blood of Jesus the
[49:45] the body amen amen is the temple
[49:50] of the Holy Ghost
[49:52] so in this Temple amen I want it to be
[49:56] holy
[49:57] and I I presented as a Living Sacrifice
[50:01] I have a reason why
[50:04] it's a reason why I want you to present
[50:07] your bodies
[50:09] as a Living Sacrifice
[50:11] it's a reason why it won't hurt you
[50:15] amen it's a blessing to do it
[50:18] it's not it's not something that's going
[50:21] to make you know when the world is
[50:24] styling and falling and and trying to
[50:27] look Purity and cute
[50:29] amen you want to be holy
[50:32] when the world even has its own fashion
[50:36] in his own look you want to look like
[50:38] Jesus
[50:41] you want to live like Jesus you want to
[50:45] be like Jesus
[50:47] amen but the world got his own thing
[50:49] going
[50:51] they met because the world don't want to
[50:54] present their bodies as a Living
[50:56] Sacrifice I'm talking about
[51:02] the Redemption of our bodies
[51:05] amen
[51:07] I'm talking about you're looking forward
[51:09] to something
[51:11] you got you know you got Heaven on your
[51:13] mind
[51:15] praise God so when we're wrapped up tied
[51:17] up take it up and cannot see the grace
[51:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ that has
[51:22] appeared
[51:24] we cannot see what the blood has
[51:27] achieved
[51:28] praise God that I don't look at this
[51:31] body amen as something that's
[51:34] Eternal but I look at a temporal body
[51:37] something that I had temporary
[51:41] praise God it's not gonna last it's
[51:43] correct it's corrupt
[51:47] praise God

[52:01] can't carry nothing out without
[52:03] character
[52:04] are you with me
[52:07] so he said

[52:12] amen so here holding acceptable
[52:16] unto God which is our which is your what
[52:20] it's your reasonable service
[52:23] praise God
[52:25] what can I give God
[52:27] I can present my bodies
[52:29] as a Living Sacrifice
[52:33] why because it states that you bought
[52:38] with the price
[52:40] oh you're with me if you uh recognize
[52:43] you've been redeemed you've been watched
[52:46] in the blood of the Lamb then ought to
[52:48] present my bodies as a Living Sacrifice

[52:55] bought with the price
[52:57] thank you Jesus the blood Hallelujah

[53:44] and he says and be not what
[53:48] conform to
[53:53] the world is Ever Changing
[53:56] but he remains
[53:57] [Music]
[53:59] Jesus remained the same

[56:15] be you what
[56:17] transformed by what
[56:19] renewing of your mind your mind has to

[57:31] because it wasn't pleasing in his sight
[57:33] isn't that right
[57:34] but God was pleased with evil sacrifice
[57:37] isn't that right
[57:39] and then it caused jealousy

[58:28] would have you to walk

[59:03] when he looks at you what he want
[59:07] it doesn't matter Cain it didn't matter
[59:09] God says uh evil your sacrifice being

[59:14] said hey don't it's no problem just do
[59:17] what he did and you'll you'll be
[59:19] accepted too
[59:21] but we take the attitude I'm not going
[59:23] to do what God says up amen I'm not
[59:26] going to please God I'm gonna please
[59:27] myself I'm a police
[59:30] God if you can't accept what I give you

[1:00:36] denomination
[1:00:38] are you up
[1:00:40] we got to please Jesus
[1:00:44] I'm afraid that
[1:00:46] people are leading people
[1:00:48] to their church and not the crisis
[1:00:50] that's what the servant of God said
[1:00:53] oh blessed lead this message all these
[1:00:55] Mysteries mystified

[1:22:49] and not only they
[1:22:52] but ourselves
[1:22:54] also which have the what
[1:23:01] so when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:23:05] [Music]
[1:23:06] you're grown

[1:23:12] I said you're groaning is over
[1:23:16] I don't have to grow no more
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:23] see if you're still groaning
[1:23:27] praise God
[1:23:28] then the first fruits are not there
[1:23:32] but the fresh fruits of the spirit takes
[1:23:35] away your Browning
[1:23:37] Hallelujah
[1:23:39] why should I groan
[1:23:42] praise God because amen now I have the
[1:23:45] first fruit of the spirit
[1:23:48] the Holy Ghost is here
[1:23:51] praise God to take away my groaning
[1:23:54] hallelujah thank God for the Holy Ghost
[1:23:57] praise God I don't have to groan
[1:24:03] even we ourselves grow within ourselves
[1:24:07] amen
[1:24:09] now
[1:24:11] grown within ourselves
[1:24:14] Waiting For What
[1:24:17] the adoption
[1:24:20] see he talks about another groaning
[1:24:24] praise God he talks about groaning and
[1:24:28] waiting for adoption
[1:24:30] so one groaning is now
[1:24:34] in the first fruits of the spirit took
[1:24:36] it away
[1:24:37] and the Holy Spirit takes us to
[1:24:40] wait
[1:24:42] for adoption
[1:24:45] are you with me
[1:24:48] so by the grace of God adoption is ours
[1:24:55] see the problem God talks about
[1:24:57] receiving the Holy Ghost and then talks
[1:24:59] about moving into adoption
[1:25:01] are you a man
[1:25:03] but if you don't move into adoption
[1:25:07] then you'll be still groaning
[1:25:10] are you with me but once you move into
[1:25:14] adoption I believe the opening of the
[1:25:17] word is bringing us to a place of
[1:25:19] adoption
[1:25:23] to placing
[1:25:26] to positioning yourself
[1:25:29] because the word the seals have been
[1:25:31] taken off the book to put you in a
[1:25:34] position
[1:25:36] are you with me
[1:25:38] but people say well what is adoption
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:43] he said waiting for the adoption to the
[1:25:46] wit
[1:25:47] praise God you know this morning as I
[1:25:51] prayed and meditated on the Lord I said
[1:25:53] Lord
[1:25:54] what happened
[1:25:56] the people were so in anticipation
[1:25:59] for body change
[1:26:02] at that particular time the good day
[1:26:05] finding what's in their mind the
[1:26:07] thousands of years would take place you
[1:26:10] know some people say I don't believe no
[1:26:12] more I don't believe Paul message you no
[1:26:15] more
[1:26:16] because why
[1:26:18] Paul said
[1:26:20] It's Gonna Come shortly amen all these
[1:26:23] people are talking about the coming of
[1:26:25] the Lord is not and all of that ain't
[1:26:28] nothing happened yet
[1:26:29] it's been a thousand years and you know
[1:26:33] is the Bible still right
[1:26:37] some folk would say
[1:26:40] y'all better get another book
[1:26:43] because what
[1:26:46] it looked like something was happening
[1:26:48] right there ain't nothing happened
[1:26:52] and now people look at the message about
[1:26:55] ain't nothing happened
[1:26:57] as well leave it
[1:27:00] are you with me
[1:27:01] see what happens as people amen they
[1:27:05] they said well I believe the Bible well
[1:27:08] can you find it within yourself that
[1:27:11] what your
[1:27:12] what your mama told you about your
[1:27:15] grandparents told you about the great
[1:27:16] grandparents told you about and it still
[1:27:19] hadn't happened
[1:27:23] and now it's hundreds of years later and
[1:27:25] you asked me to believe what the Bible
[1:27:29] said
[1:27:30] things ain't happened yet
[1:27:33] why you want me to believe in something
[1:27:35] that they died for amen they live in the
[1:27:39] anticipation for certain to take place
[1:27:41] and it hadn't happened
[1:27:47] they said they were in the last days 2
[1:27:50] 000 years ago
[1:27:54] and they went through powerless
[1:27:56] dangerous times and here we are now
[1:28:02] waiting
[1:28:05] maybe 40 50 years
[1:28:07] for something
[1:28:09] to happen
[1:28:11] a Rapture to take place
[1:28:13] a change in the bodies
[1:28:17] could you see how people said I don't
[1:28:19] believe the Bible
[1:28:21] I don't believe it no more
[1:28:23] I walk away in this
[1:28:25] in despair
[1:28:27] I don't believe the message
[1:28:28] I don't believe this
[1:28:30] see because people don't want to wait
[1:28:33] but you have to have the fresh fruits of
[1:28:35] the spirit to take away your groaning
[1:28:40] are you with me without the Holy Ghost
[1:28:43] amen it ain't real to you
[1:28:46] it's just something you heard about
[1:28:48] something people tell you about it ain't
[1:28:50] real till you get there
[1:28:53] praise God
[1:28:54] to the Holy Ghost to break it alive
[1:28:57] and you know that it's just not on pages
[1:28:59] but it's in there
[1:29:01] praise God something inside of me
[1:29:04] amen I got a real Witness
[1:29:07] praise God the Holy Ghost make the Bible
[1:29:10] live
[1:29:12] praise God that's why they waited and
[1:29:14] threw out the ages they waited
[1:29:16] because God gave him something that
[1:29:19] would cause them to wait
[1:29:21] praise God
[1:29:23] and if you don't have nothing you won't
[1:29:25] wait
[1:29:25] because you don't have to wait in power
[1:29:27] you don't have nothing to sustain you in
[1:29:30] the time of payment
[1:29:32] praise God I got something to sustain me
[1:29:35] in the fame
[1:29:37] when the fame on his own amen I got food
[1:29:40] that you know not of
[1:29:42] praise God I got a Elijah had a little
[1:29:45] woman
