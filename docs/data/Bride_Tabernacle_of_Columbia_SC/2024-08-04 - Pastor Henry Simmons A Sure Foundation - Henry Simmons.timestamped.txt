[32:43] amen God bless you Isaiah
[32:47] 28 and
[32:51] 14 Isaiah 28
[32:54] and4 ain't God good amen so many
[32:58] blessings undeserved amen amen L Isaiah
[33:06] 284 it says wherefore
[33:10] heal the word of the Lord ye scon for
[33:14] men that rule this people which is in
[33:21] Jerusalem because ye have said we have
[33:25] made a covenant with death
[33:28] and with hell are we at
[33:33] agreement when the overflowing Scourge
[33:37] shall pass
[33:39] through it shall not come unto us for we
[33:44] have made lies our
[33:47] refuge and under the
[33:50] falsehood have we hid
[33:55] ourselves therefore th said the Lord God
[33:59] behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a
[34:05] stone a tried Stone a precious
[34:10] Cornerstone a sure
[34:13] Foundation he that believeth shall not
[34:16] make
[34:18] haste may God bless the in this word you
[34:20] may be
[34:22] seated he said therefore thus said the
[34:25] Lord Behold our l z for Foundation a
[34:29] stone a tried Stone a precious
[34:33] Cornerstone a
[34:35] sure Foundation amen
[34:39] yes now the Bible says in songs if the
[34:43] foundation be destroyed it says what can
[34:45] the righteous
[34:46] do your foundation if you ever were
[34:51] building a house or some type of
[34:55] building it's very important that the
[34:59] foundation be laid properly
[35:03] amen because you can build the whole
[35:06] house when it's off of
[35:08] foundation it's going to come up
[35:13] crooked and when the storms are
[35:17] come I remember uh the foundation was
[35:22] off and somebody tried to put the
[35:25] roof on the building
[35:29] see The Headstone can't come to the body
[35:32] they try to put a roof on and when they
[35:34] tried to put the roof on because the
[35:36] foundation off the walls start
[35:40] buckling so the building was in danger
[35:43] of
[35:44] falling you can't put the
[35:47] headstone on a
[35:50] building that the foundation is
[35:55] off because it's going to cause when The
[35:57] Headstone go to set on it's going to
[35:59] crush it
[36:01] amen are you with me amen so uh often
[36:05] times people call themselves contractors
[36:08] and
[36:09] Builders and yet they're not skillful
[36:12] that's
[36:15] right a sure Foundation bless Jesus one
[36:20] thing you want to be
[36:23] correct is your
[36:25] foundation amen when they were building
[36:29] this church building they bought in a
[36:33] hundred and something
[36:35] load truckloads of
[36:38] dirt and they had to each time they
[36:41] bring it in they had to roll it and pack
[36:47] it and that was a over aund truck loads
[36:52] before they can put the builds and slab
[36:55] down
[36:58] and the inspector had to come and
[37:01] inspect whether or not you lay you laid
[37:06] a good foundation whether it's packed
[37:08] right that's right because before you
[37:12] pull that
[37:14] cement it's got to be
[37:17] right then they had to dig around before
[37:20] you
[37:21] pour and make sure everything that's
[37:24] going to the pillars are going to set
[37:28] they got to make sure all of this
[37:30] Foundation is strong enough and is done
[37:33] according to the blueprint that's
[37:35] right we need a blueprint to go
[37:40] by and uh and you got to draw up a
[37:45] plan for uh the building in which you
[37:48] were going to
[37:50] construct are you with me amen so it was
[37:53] very important that these this
[37:55] foundation work was doing properly amen
[37:59] because if it wasn't time going to tell
[38:03] amen yes
[38:05] sir when you go up there to put that
[38:07] roof
[38:09] on everything going to be out of
[38:13] joint and I believe that here it says
[38:17] let's look at uh he says 16th verse
[38:22] again there therefore thus said the Lord
[38:26] behold I land Z for a foundation a
[38:31] stone now he says a what a tried
[38:37] Stone not just a stone but if this stone
[38:41] is tried that's it's been tested amen so
[38:45] you got to be careful you got to make
[38:47] sure the stone has been tested
[38:52] am so he said a tri Stone a precious
[38:56] Coral
[38:59] Stone amen you got to make sure your
[39:01] Corners are
[39:03] right cuz if your Corners ain't right
[39:06] you in trouble amen a precious
[39:10] Cornerstone we got to have a a stone to
[39:12] start everything if you building by
[39:14] Stones you got to have a starting
[39:17] place a precious
[39:20] Cornerstone a
[39:22] what a sure this thing got to be sure
[39:26] you can't take no Chances with it amen
[39:29] you putting up a structure it might cost
[39:31] you uh uh
[39:33] $500,000 or million dollar structure
[39:36] when you put up that structure you don't
[39:38] want no travel at the river amen
[39:41] [Applause]
[39:42] amen all of the money you invested in
[39:46] it it won't do you no good why the
[39:49] foundation is off amen
[39:52] yes so people look at it say man what
[39:56] why did they expect catch that you've
[39:59] seen Builders crumble all over the world
[40:01] in America because somebody pay the
[40:05] inspector little extra dollars under the
[40:07] table Amen to pass
[40:10] it bridges falling down and everything
[40:13] because somebody done pay some under
[40:16] cover money amen the the the pass
[40:22] it one of the brothers said he was
[40:24] inspecting pipes and he said said he he
[40:28] had to make sure everything that's in
[40:30] that pipe is right and inspect it
[40:34] properly but the inspector come by and
[40:37] somebody passes some money and they make
[40:39] sure and they don't
[40:42] care so when the storms
[40:46] come and the the roads start the pipes
[40:50] start busting in the
[40:53] roads are all bust up and all
[40:58] and you wonder why people amen tried to
[41:02] get around the foundation
[41:05] work thank you because you
[41:07] might pay more almost in the foundation
[41:11] than you pay in the whole
[41:16] business I said before we can get this
[41:19] structure
[41:20] started we probably had already paid
[41:24] over $100,000
[41:27] just getting the foundation work
[41:30] started and you said well you you don't
[41:34] see no building no see nothing but the
[41:37] foundation work going to cost you over
[41:42] $100,000 and we wern't expecting
[41:46] that cuz all we had was so many hundreds
[41:50] a couple

[49:18] quoting us everywhere you went a person
[49:21] had had a little memory bank you heard
[49:24] this
[49:25] everywhere a person that thought
[49:28] themselves to be a Christian could quote
[49:31] it in the
[49:33] schoolhouse Rachel come and ask me you
[49:35] know what what about the song
[49:38] Everybody's

[50:12] that the uh we don't have to worry about
[50:15] the syrians
[50:17] coming we don't have to worry about the
[50:20] enemy so many people are in church and
[50:22] they ain't worried about the devil
[50:24] they're not worried about
