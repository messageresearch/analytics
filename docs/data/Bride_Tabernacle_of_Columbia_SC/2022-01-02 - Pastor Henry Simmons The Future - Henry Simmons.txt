abraham the thing which i do 18. for i knew him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the weight of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him 20. i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know 22. and abraham drew near and said will thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked 24. that before form thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as a wicked that he be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth you write 26. and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes 28. and he spoke unto him yet again and said prevention there shall be 40 found there and he said if i if i will not do it for 46 30. and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the unto the lord prevented there shall be 20 found there and he said i will not destroy it for 26 together and he said oh let not the lord be angry i would speak yet again once prevention 10 shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for 10 sake may god bless you read this world to me to see them i want to talk this morning as we look at uh 2022 and everybody i mean you have many people are predicting what would happen in 2022 and and they are saying almost it is more of the same and it's not really uh any good news on the horizon it looks like it's all going to be um they said they predict gas prices for four dollars and something a gallon and all kinds of things and the food prices are already going up higher and um the virus is one after another and we're having earthquakes in elgin and seven earthquakes and you know we had some of the sanctions moved there in elgin lately and what is going on and you know south carolina is not california but things are happening we had them over there by the nuclear plant so everything is just in haywire the whole world is in haywire we're in um january and it's almost 80 degrees and i mean we're supposed to be maybe seeing some zero degrees and freezing weather but what's going on what does the future hold where are we now what's going on you know you know i keep on saying you know i said lord what is going on you know it's almost it was a prayer watchman what a night what what's going on we need somebody to need something from you dude lord we need to hear from you what's going on watchmen what is god the same god that tells us you know people are going now because they want to know the future more than ever people are going to the psychic world and they're trying to get spirit guides to come down and tell them give them answers because people are baffled they're going through mentally they're going through physically they're going through all kind of goings because they want to find out what is going on with me what's wrong amen they feel like something is happening and we want to know the unknown we want to know what's what's my future so people are calling these people and they're they're they're reaching out to people that they think that are spiritual people and they're trying to get access for the future so more than ever the people that go to church believe in god they're saying well i can't go it's coming like saul he said i can't get no answer he meant from god so let me he turned to the witch of endure and a lot of people are turning to witchcraft and witches and they'll turn into i mean the the church look like it's failed them they're going to uh eastern religions they're going back the the blacks are going back into uh ancestor worship they're going to a voodoo and all kind of stuff they they're starting to do the things that the heathens used to do and back in the jungles of africa they they're trying to reach back and trying to find themselves and find answers and they don't know what they're looking for but yet they know that what they have they're not satisfied with it but i'm saying amen it's because people are not satisfied but i'm determined that god is the same amen god is the same amen praise god instead of lining up with the word of god and getting right with god where god can answer and oh no they don't want to do that they may they want to know the future amen but they don't believe that god got the future in control and god knows your future if you want to know oh lord hallelujah so here this morning we looked at abraham the three angels coming down amen and appearing to abraham and god amen the lord amen began to say shall i hide amen from abraham the thing that i'm getting ready to do i said the future amen was going to be revealed to abraham amen as the future home is revealed to the bride of jesus christ god reveals the future to you and i it meant god said shall i hide from abraham the bible said surely amos 3 7 says surely the lord god will do nothing but he reveals his secrets to his servant the prophet praise god amen before god does anything major god got an egypt on the earth he meant to reveal warning before judgment are you with me so brother and sister we where we standing today amen we should not stand in awe amen like we don't have an answer to the problem amen but jesus is the answer the word of god has our answer to what's going on now but do we really want answers see sometimes we want to just something to soothe our conscience something to us stabilize our lives a little bit something that we can rest contented even though it might be a lie amen but it makes us feel good and feel secured even if you give me a lie amen make me feel good comfort me amen praise god so a lot of folks are reaching out for comfort but here in the book of genesis uh 41 genesis 41 i don't know about you but god reveals himself through dreams and and uh and sometimes uh god be trying to shake us up and and i feel like some of us have been dreaming dreams and god has been speaking to you in dreams but yet you're not listening to the voice of god but sometimes god won't shake you amen long enough amen that you need to listen to me you need to hear what i'm telling you praise god god is saying everywhere you turn listen i'm trying to tell you something amen can't you hear god's voice speaking to you but look amen now as people are inquisitive and they're searching for what's on the horizon for what's going to happen in 2022 amen i believe we're into very we're into some surprises so amen surprise after surprise things are happening that beyond people imagination amen it's how it happened in 21. amen and look at 22 i believe it's already happening right now what's going on it's it's it's a surprise that it meant it baffled probably the weather people what's going on where are we is it summer or winter where are we i'm saying brother and sister let us not be surprised of the happenings the signs of the time let us not be shocked but let us be ready see i believe god was saying to abraham i'm preparing you and i'm trying to get you ready for sodom burning and i know abraham was just standing the gap for lot and amen because that was his nephew and i want to stand in the gap for him and he and he he said god will you destroy the righteous with it be it far from you lord i know you're not going to do that amen but god says prevent you if i find he said lord prayerfully you find 50 there i wonder if god would look through colombia and look through south carolina can he find 50. that is so like the god amen if if he can find 50 that's surrendered everything god whatever your will whatever you want god lord whatever your will is i'm willing to give it up all the lord i'm so loud amen my whole life is surrendered to you i'm so like god everything i got blown to you i went in here to find 50 this morning you know you know it's all right you know you know as it always says our actions speak what our actions speak louder than our words it doesn't matter how loud amen we speak and how loud we cry but can we match it with our action amen so your future amen are you so tied down and so twisted up and so bound up that you cannot let god have first place in your life will you not let him have preeminence in your life are you so amen uh are you so uh caught up are you so busy that god don't have you don't have time for god amen we don't have time to come to church we don't have time to pray we don't have time to seek his face brother and sister it's got to be a time that we got to calm down calm our nerves get in a quiet place and hear god's voice and him speak to us and amen reveal himself to us in a greater way god speak to me i need to hear from you praise god i i'm determined i want to hear your voice concerning my future amen it's just in us to want to understand what the future plan where i can be prepared i want to plan for the future you know you know the bible said wait no there's no what where there's no vision are you with me the people perish so if you don't have a vision you don't have an understanding he said now god knew abraham's future he knew that he would prepare his children and how he would teach him the right thing and how they would oh he would command his children how he you know it's something about amen god knowing that abraham was a righteous man and abraham believed the word and he was going to give his children direction and guidance in a proper way are you ready to do that with abraham because god said amen because of amen abraham because of who he is and what he would do with the word amen i'm going to reveal my word to him i'm going to reveal what i'm about to do because i know abraham does god know you this morning do he can he trust you with what he's about to do can it would it be all right if god revealed to you what he's about to do praise god i know the secret things belong to the lord those things are revealed and wrong to us his children are you of me i'm here this morning i i hadn't gotten to genesis 41 and 28 41 28 i hope caleb get a mic get a mic so you might help me because if i'm doing some reading this morning but it's all in preparation god revealing himself this morning and you must be ready amen see i don't think the people in sodom was prepared i believe the whole

when the son of man amen the future amen god wasn't hiding from noah what he was about to do in the future he said the whole world every imagination in in every imagination the thought of man was only continually evil and he said in the days of noah in genesis 6 it repented me that i what i mean man and the bible said as it was in the days of lord as it was in the days of title that shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed brother and sister why sodomites be in sodom and why the people are in the spirit of noah age amen and in the spirit of sodom amen amen there must be a people in the spirit of the son of man the revealing of the son of man argue with me there must be a people on the other side while sodom is there there must be somebody amen and the lord as the two messages

to have your way praise god it's not about you and me it's about him god i want you to get all the glory all the praise everything lord i want to give it to you you gave it to me and lord i give it back to you hallelujah have your way hallelujah this is your season this is your day where god has visited his people what god is about to do is going to show it to pharaoh amen pharaoh had a dream god just supernaturally visited not one of the jews but he visited a gentile but he revealed it to a jew what he's about to do amen he revealed it to joseph amen and god is gracious this day that he reveals his secret to you and i go ahead on read the next verse and behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt go ahead and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famous shall consume the land and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that fame and following for it shall be very grievous and for that the dream was double enough to fail pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seventh seven plentiest years and let them gather all the food see god will show you and prepare you once god show you praise god then he's showing you for a reason that you might get what prepared amen god what god is doing he's showing us for a reason for you to prepare yourself are you with me all this shaking and all of this that's happening is for a reason for god to get your attention so you prepare yourself now remember while all this are happening every even the all the witch doctors and all the wise and all the protect prognosticators and all of those people who wise people and all the scientific world and all the church worlds they don't know what's going on but they can't interpret what's going on they're looking at it global warming they're saying this is going to happen that's going to happen brothers and sisters but you and i understand what's going to happen brothers and sisters and that's what it is if we truly understand what's going to happen and why these things are coming like they're coming if we don't then we're going to have to ask god amen we're going to have to search god search the scriptures back to the word brother and sister back to god and i i believe let's go back to john three the book of jonah three i i believe that as i said the other night bringing in the new year i'll wake up and call on god are you all whippy because the time is late the hour is late now i was late people the bible says before it's coming there'll be a great fall in the way i believe the pandemic has helped the great fallen away people have lukewarm not hot not cold sometimes i glance at what the religious world is doing they are bringing the nightclub atmosphere into the church the lights the dancing they're giving the people entertainment so people are going to a church that would entertain them and they can dance and get their groove on they they're really the young people are excited and some of the old people older people they just instead of spontaneous

subject yourself are you willing to humble yourself are you willing to say god i want it even if i have to die to myself pray amen i got to lose my life that i might gain it [Music] praise god you know i jonah may not have known what would happen to him but he was willing to sacrifice it all he may not have known what was waiting on him in the sea but he said i'll come to a place and i'm more concerned about them then i'm concerned about me are you with me because i know i'm out of the perfect will of god so i'm more concerned about them that i'm concerned about me oh hallelujah jesus said a greater than jonah is here and i believe that uh greater than jonah is here this morning praise god jonah are y'all with me can you see the picture he got to a place where he was more concerned about them he knew that the trouble amen was because of his disobedience [Music] are you with me even though we know god had a divine purpose in that are you with me so god said all things would work what together to them [Music] amen to them who are the calls see brother and sister you might have made some uh uh mistakes and some things have happened to your life and look like it's all turned backwards and amen and ain't working out right but it'll work to you good praise god but if you can just come to yourself and recognize lord praise god it's me amen i'm willing to surrender all now praise god i'm ready to die to myself now i really know give it up all god i'm willing to come let's get it straight now so here out there jonah perhaps he didn't know what was awaiting him but he was willing amen that the ship could sail and that the storm could stop brother and sister could you be the hold up could you be the one that's standing in the way of your own personal breakthrough could you be the one could you could could it not be amen other folks from the outside could you be the problem for the storms in your life jonah recognized he was a problem there was no more he brother and sister can't you see it was exciting for jonah to experience the supernatural god in a supernatural way when he was willing to give himself up he did not know on the other side of his circumstances and his situation that he was going to receive a supernatural experience that was going to be something greater than he ever experienced are you with me and when he throws him overboard he finds himself ha oxygen in a fish at the bottom of the sea and then now i can see him the word of god coming to him that solomon prayed if we're carried astray and if we look towards that temple then lord hear the prayer he said i'm gonna look towards that holy temple and he began to pray god on the other side john recognized i'm not dead he was walking around in this great fish belly did he know what
