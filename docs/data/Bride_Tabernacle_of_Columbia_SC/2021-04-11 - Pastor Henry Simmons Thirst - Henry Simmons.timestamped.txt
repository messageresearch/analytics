[31:49] psalms 42 it says here
[31:54] as the heart painted after the water
[31:56] broke
[31:58] so painted my soul after the o god
[32:02] my soul thirsteth for god for the living
[32:04] god
[32:06] when shall i come and appear before god
[32:10] my tears have been my meat day and night
[32:14] while they continue saying to me where
[32:16] is thy god
[32:19] when i remember these things
[32:22] i pulled out my soul in me
[32:26] for i had done with the multitude
[32:29] and i went with them to the house of god
[32:33] with the voice of joy and praise
[32:37] and the multitude that kept
[32:41] holy day thou art
[32:45] why are thou cast down o my soul
[32:48] while thou disquiet within me hope in
[32:51] god
[32:52] for i shall yet praise him
[32:56] for the help of his candidates
[33:01] oh my god my soul is cast down within me
[33:06] therefore will i remember
[33:09] thee from the land of joy
[33:12] and of hermione
[33:16] hermannite and from the hill of mr
[33:22] deep call it unto deep
[33:25] at the noise that thy water sprout
[33:28] all thy waves all thy waves
[33:32] thou billows are gone over me
[33:37] yet the lord will command his loving
[33:41] kindness
[33:42] in the daytime and in the night his
[33:46] songs shall be
[33:48] with me and my prayer unto
[33:51] the god of my life
[33:54] god bless you in this word you may be
[33:56] seated
[34:02] we want to talk this morning for a few
[34:04] moments concerning thirst
[34:10] first the book of saint matthew
[34:14] 5
[34:19] he says and seeing the multitude
[34:23] he went up into the mountain
[34:26] and when he had set his disciples came
[34:29] unto him
[34:31] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[34:33] saying
[34:35] blessed are the poor in spirit
[34:39] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[34:42] blessed are they that mourn for they
[34:46] shall be comforted
[34:48] blessed unto me for they shall inherit
[34:51] the earth
[34:54] blessed are they which do what
[34:58] hunger and what thirsts thirst after
[35:01] righteousness for
[35:02] they shall be filled
[35:07] thirsts
[35:11] blessed are they that do hunger and
[35:13] thirst after righteousness for they
[35:15] shall be filled
[35:18] while i was in prayer yesterday i just
[35:22] and i was just praying because
[35:25] we're living in an hour and a day that
[35:30] and people come to church
[35:35] you meet people every day christian
[35:37] so-called
[35:42] and we wonder sometimes
[35:47] who wants god
[35:51] is there any that thirsts after god they
[35:53] need that seek in the lord
[35:58] and i was talking to brother randy a
[36:00] little bit after prayer
[36:03] and he says there are people and he
[36:05] didn't know
[36:06] i was praying and it was it was going
[36:09] through me he said
[36:11] he said there are people out there
[36:12] that's hungry and thirsts after god just
[36:14] need somebody to tell them
[36:17] need somebody to witness to him there
[36:20] are people that's really
[36:21] hungry and thirsty and i thought
[36:25] you know because i thought about going
[36:28] another way this morning and i said
[36:30] people that are really hungry and
[36:33] thirsty
[36:35] and i saw that they're admitted in it
[36:39] they're thirsting and they don't
[36:40] understand what they're thirsting for
[36:45] so here in um isaiah
[36:52] 55
[36:56] [Music]
[36:58] isaiah 55 it says because the many
[37:01] many people are thirsting but they're
[37:03] trying to satisfy their thirst
[37:06] with different things and to the
[37:09] christian he said
[37:10] deep call it to deep
[37:15] how deep is your experience
[37:18] are you just satisfied is there a deep
[37:20] calling to deep
[37:22] in your life if god is telling you let's
[37:26] go deeper
[37:28] or you come to a place of complacency
[37:31] would you just satisfy where you are
[37:35] are you desiring a deeper walk with god
[37:40] and if if there's a desire for a deeper
[37:43] war
[37:44] you know many times people experience
[37:47] and
[37:48] and their experiences they don't know
[37:51] what level
[37:51] they are on they don't know or
[37:55] you know it's something about uh being
[37:58] in the water and it's just waste
[38:00] just knee-deep and it's something about
[38:04] being in the water and it's wasting
[38:08] and then it's something that that you
[38:13] all the way in where you it's all the
[38:16] way over your head
[38:19] how deep is your experience
[38:22] see it's sometimes the cup is half
[38:25] filled
[38:27] and sometimes the cup is three-quarter
[38:30] but david said my cup
[38:33] my cup runneth over surely goodness and
[38:37] merchants shall follow me all the days
[38:39] of my life
[38:41] it's something about when your cup is
[38:43] running over
[38:46] i believe that's the one that has a
[38:48] overflow
[38:51] a overflow of the joy of the lord and
[38:55] that's the one that's at peace with god
[39:00] you know we cannot be at peace with god
[39:04] until we experience that peace within
[39:10] and we must not not let anything
[39:12] anything in our lives disturb
[39:15] the joy and the peace that god has given
[39:17] us
[39:22] but sometimes it takes a deeper walk
[39:25] with god
[39:26] to get to the point
[39:30] my soul thirsts
[39:33] whether you've come to a place the soul
[39:38] thirsted for the living god and
[39:41] the the thirst have been quenched
[39:46] you've gotten to that place where you
[39:49] have that experience
[39:50] or you have that experience with god and
[39:54] your thirst you're not thirsty anymore
[39:58] you become satisfied with that living
[40:01] god
[40:05] amen you received the water of life
[40:13] and we find
[40:16] that our desires
[40:20] the thirst having to do well
[40:24] with uh the desires
[40:28] what are we desiring what do we want
[40:32] the prophet of god talks about the flesh
[40:35] has
[40:35] its desires it desires
[40:39] fleshly and earthly things
[40:43] and you try to satisfy that thirst
[40:47] he says is it a female to desire to be
[40:51] pretty that is a
[40:54] uh it's normal for uh
[40:57] a a female to want to be purty
[41:01] that's an arm of thirst
[41:05] but not the beauty of the world
[41:11] but she'll she's the dawn itself of mine
[41:14] it's a period to change faces and
[41:16] sobriety
[41:18] according to timothy 2
[41:22] but there is a thirst
[41:25] with inside each and every one of us
[41:30] my soul he says my soul
[41:34] thirsted for the living god
[41:37] so he was not just talking about the the
[41:40] the body needs water and and we
[41:44] we thirst because it's an alarm goes off
[41:47] it's
[41:48] abuzz goes off when we need water
[41:52] and sometimes even in america you might
[41:55] think it's strange that
[41:56] people have dehydration
[42:00] they're just out there and they're
[42:01] working and they
[42:04] they don't know what happened to them
[42:05] they just fall out and they go
[42:07] to the hospital and they find it out
[42:09] that
[42:11] the alarm went off you needed to drink
[42:15] some more water you needed fluid
[42:20] and if you're not careful you might have
[42:22] a sun stroke or whatever
[42:25] so there's a thirst for water
[42:30] it's a buzzer alarm that goes off when
[42:33] that torch is there
[42:36] and that little buzzer that goes off
[42:38] you're gonna have to
[42:40] you you have to tend to it and you have
[42:42] to supply that water
[42:44] for that body if you do not supply the
[42:48] water
[42:50] amen you will perish you'll die
[42:55] many times you go to a hospital and they
[42:57] have to give
[42:58] folks iv fluid and so forth because
[43:01] why there's something inside of them
[43:08] because they are a lack of
[43:11] the water in their body causing them
[43:14] to be sick and if they don't get that
[43:17] fluid in them they'll die
[43:22] and that alarm went off
[43:26] the alarm goes off in cygnus get to the
[43:29] water you need water
[43:33] if you want to live you better get some
[43:35] water
[43:38] okay so by the
[43:41] grace of god here in isaiah 55
[43:45] he said ho everyone that what
[43:51] see come
[43:54] ye to the water are you with me
[43:59] if you're thirsty he said come to the
[44:01] water
[44:05] you know
[44:09] there's an invitation there
[44:12] there's an invitation from from god to
[44:15] you
[44:17] to come to the water
[44:23] nothing is going to replace that water
[44:27] come to the water
[44:31] amen and he that
[44:34] has no what no money
[44:38] come ye and buy and eat
[44:42] yea come and buy wine and
[44:45] milk without money and without what
[44:49] price wherefore do you spend
[44:52] money for that which
[44:59] some people waste their whole paycheck
[45:02] spent all their money
[45:03] [Music]

[46:06] certain age they
[46:07] look for companionship because that
[46:10] flesh they aim at things in that body
[46:13] began to you know act up
[46:18] and sometimes before they get big enough

[46:25] they know how to do that computer jump
[46:27] put it up
[46:29] they know how to bypass and do all kind
[46:32] of tricks on that computer

[46:37] grow up before their time
[46:40] and every parent think i got a good my
[46:43] child don't do that
