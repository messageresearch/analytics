well god because we know that you know how to help your children we trust you to do it now in jesus name amen god is good amen first thessalonians 4 is very familiar but i had another way i was going and as i was friend i kind of got stirred because i was praying seeking god for direction and guidance you know a lot of things that in life you want want to do to just try to help folk you know it's many things that you want to do just to help folks to have a better life sometimes you know people think about community service you think about helping you know in any way you can help folk you you know as a christian you just got that about you you want to help people and so i was thinking about what kind what can we do to be a help to the community or be the help to one another and i was thinking about that and praying lord you know i got many desires first thessalonians 4 and 13. it says but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are sleep that you sorry not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also will sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the what coming of the lord shall not prevent them not sleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord and now and so shall we ever be with the lord we're full confident one another with these words god bless you reading which word you may be seated in the 15th verse he says for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we that we which are lodged and remain until the coming of the lord should not prevent them that sleep he's addressing us that are lie you know could you think that such a word and such sermons that would preach what anticipation that those people and what expectation it should have set those people's hearts on fire i mean they could should have been stirred to the utmost because the jesus that had died and was crucified had risen and had come forth to vindicate that he was alive showed himself by many infallible proofs but he promised after a period of time paul comes in and meets him on the water road to the masters and later on he began to pin these letters to the churches and to give the church expectation and hope and understanding about god's redemptive plan so they will earn the great expectation god the coming of the lord i believe that they had that expectation that i'm coming back not only am i coming back but the muscle was something that way back in job when he talked about my redeemer live they must have known something about a resurrection because even joseph said don't leave my bones in egypt they must have knew that it was something that they could be on the expectation that there was going to be a resurrection even uh the story was told at ladder's grave i know i see my brother again so they knew that was life after death i'll see him again god is coming by in the resurrection after what i believe that they talked about our day because they said in the resurrection at the last day are you with me and we are saying that we are living in the last days because amen david it has been said they meant for the last 2000 years in the last days because on the day of pentecost he said this was that was spoken of by the prophet joel that in the last days said god i poured my spirit upon what all flesh so they must have thought that amen we're in the last days amen so there must be a resurrection not that it's not a resurrection that did not take place in their day because jesus had died in the old saints of the old testament rose up with him walked around jerusalem they had experienced a coming of the lord that had come in their day and there was a supernatural happening there was a vindication amen that god amen amen had promised him a resurrection and he had given them a resurrection the saints saw they met the saints that were dead walking around jerusalem the prophet god tells us about a resurrection in the rapture message that it was 40 days before he went back so just before the rapture amen we shouldn't be on anticipation of the coming of the lord but the saints that went on it was said that we perhaps just before the rapture we'll begin to communicate with those saints and see those saints that are crossed over beyond the curtain of time and we'll see them and we'll be able to talk to them are you up there so as they appeared until many at that resurrection what about this resurrection the coming of the lord so i know you know it's a lot of things we wish to do we wish to achieve and what you should accomplish and and you know i'm so proud of the achievements that a lot of you are making in life things that you're accomplishing and and i can be happy for you i'm happy you know for achievements my children and know that they'll make it but that's not what god called me amen to pat you on the back concerning your achievements in here because that's not what i'm preaching all about i think god fought those things but those things uh amen uh uh they they they're they're small they they they they're not compared to what amen i i i thank god for all the other things but they ain't nothing amen there's nothing to compare to what god has in store for you or not so amen so don't make that your major let it be a minor in your life because when you make these things major amen then god becomes your mind are you with me and so when god becomes the less instead of the greater oh you want me you need to have god flourish and all these other things he said our what i think we get more excited off of those other things than we get excited about the law i believe we'll shout and we'll be happy overjoyed over these things in this life that we have achieved and accomplished what about your soul what about your soul brother sister so i'm talking about the coming of the lord i like i say who wouldn't want to do nice things and to help amen families and help children help marriages help this help that and it's so many things that we could just probably get together and orchestrate and draw out and you know and try to help people to better themselves it's a lot of plans a lot of things could go hey you can do this better you can do that better you can do this better oh you could do this and you can do that as god told me years ago when i first started out i saw the people down the mullens working in the field sun up the sun down i think maybe twenty dollars a day hot 12 hours and they was working in those fields and i said i said i could try to help these people do better than that they don't have to live like that and i saw potential in all of them and i saw that they could achieve way beyond that and i saw that oh let me help not only the ones in the church but i want to help the community god said i didn't call you for that i did not call you for that it's the soul of man you're concerned about their soul are you with me your soul me is worth more than ten thousand worlds are you with me so your soul is the thing that god is interested in your soul so he said what prophet a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul so as i was thinking trying to get direction trying to get guidance of some of the things you get excited to do amen you see other people are doing things you want to do things you know then call you for that said get the people ready get the people ready for my coming get the people ready for the coming of the lord you know the scripture said the coming of the lord draw it if they said it two thousand years ago that the covenant of the lord draws nah what about now what about now it's not a that they started bombing syria it's not a coincidence that russia don't like that are you with me things are happening and materializing before our eyes and i can see why god says get your mind off of all these other things get the people ready for the coming of the lord are you a man a lot of things that we're excited about but are you ready for his coming are you prepared so let me in three things that the lord does uh and i'm i'm i'm cutting things kind of compact and not telling the whole story but i hope you all that's following the word understand what i'm talking about so he says in the 16th verse for the lord himself not somebody else but the lord himself and we understand that when we talk about the book of the redemption no man was able to take the book but the lion of the tribe of judah prevailed and he saw as it was a lamb slain [Music] are you with me you saw a bloody lamb he said for thy word did they take the book and then loose the word and because he is worthy i don't know what i get to a sunday because he's worthy we ought to do something they said worthy is the lamb we ought to give him something are you with me i get excited right i don't want to get excited now maybe sunday morning we get excited about it because i i some said don't don't miss that out don't miss our part because i don't want you to just intellectually learn i want you to be able to respond to the word that you have digested you know when you eat something that's good and you said that was good i told my wife i said that was really a good meal sunday you know what i'm saying it wasn't something where but it was just so tasty you know what i'm saying and i i i think god want to know when you get it run when you get the vision read it and what run if you don't run you don't get it but if you get it you read it and you're right that means you understand what i'm talking about but if you're not running you know what somebody said fire you fire your fire and then you said no fire fight you ain't getting it but don't let amen the smoke start coming up and go fire that's what they mean fire and you wait till too late and then you start running you you they tell you it was fire fight the alarm goes off the fire alarm goes off and and you supposed to know it's time to get out the building oh you get out the house the alarm going off fire oh you're with me so i i'm saying the coming of the lord draws nine and i'm trying to by the grace of god they may get your mind focused amen because if you don't get focused amen in this late hour if we don't focus on the coming of the lord and really give the most earnest heave to the things we hear we'll let them live and if we let them slip he said how shall we escape if we neglect so greater salvation this salvation is great and we are not illegal neglected amen what god has done for us when he took the book amen you must understand it ought to set your soul on fire and if your soul not set on fire that means you don't understand amen that's why you're not running okay he says matthew 25 i'll just go uh well i i i let me finish reading that in in the 16th verse it says for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout that's the first thing he does the next thing with the voice of an archangel that's the second thing in the trump of god these things that happens cause a response amen and when these things happen he said and the dead what the dead in christ shall what rise first amen now sometimes we look at amen as the prophet said we were in dead denominational systems and we've been resurrected out of those systems are you with me god comes amen as those dry bones he said can these moans live he said lord god down north so god calls you amen out amen of sin and cause you out of dead denomination of sister not amen individuals are called out amen just like it is where the shark is not the wheat green are you with me the shark amen has to they meant pull away and the wheat grain comes in the presence of the sun isn't that right the s-u-n sun and the s-o-n the wheat the word this corn the wheat that falls in the ground and die it abides along but it comes back are you up man blade oh god i can't get into that but i hope you're getting it the the totality of what the coming of the lord is all about if we see amen that is harvest time that god will manifest itself and send his angels to separate the wheat from the time are you with me so he said let them alone are you with me there was some that would ankle their faith in the word and would recognize what god is doing with the word there are others that are be spectators and onlookers but they have no gene seed life in them to reproduce itself it may look identical like real grain but there it is a hybrid seed and it doesn't have life in it to reproduce itself are you with me praise god so that we don't look for it to be amen to come back in even resurrection form you plant it in the ground and you see it may look like corn but look what it cannot reproduce life are you with me so when we see the word is sown in our hearts the word of god comes down to reproduce jesus christ again in right form but we can't see bride are you with me and when you don't see bride if but if it's gene seed life then it can reproduce christ again if you have the baptism of the holy ghost down in your soul it shall be vindicated by the light you live amen that god had vindicated who you are doesn't matter what man think about you doesn't matter what man say about you but amen the life will testify of itself the tree is known by there's fruit are you up man i gotta get away from here for a minute and try to follow matthew 25. i all these things you you know he said the second episcopal beloved i write into you in both which i stir up your pure mind by way of remembrance i can't tell you nothing that you don't know if anybody try to tell you exceed something that you don't know then is something wrong with you because you he said i never knew you but if you've been for known of god then the lord knows them that are his amen and have you been born again of the holy ghost amen the bible said you need not that any man teach you he said but the comfort of which is the holy ghost when he come he'll teach you what all things isn't that right so when somebody come to teach you something that you don't know just look at them the holy ghost knows what yeah he he should know the holy ghost and you know all things so that's smart individual amen trying to tell you something amen but by the grace of god you must know that he that's in you is the teacher and the holy ghost is your teacher amen the only thing we come to witness to amen the word that's inside of you by spirit amen we come amen to witness to you concerning that same spirit word that's in you amen and if it's in you then it has a resurrection power amen then amen praise god word witness to word you are quickened by his spirit amen because there's something that inside of you that testifies and says amen praise god you can't help from saying amen pray amen why because it's the truth the word bear witness with the truth amen your spirit bear witness with the truth amen praise god your spirit can't bear witness with all this oh lord all this nonsense stuff and thank you intellectually smart know something god don't know are you with me god knows all things and it's given to you to know the what the mysteries isn't that right if you're a bride it's given to you to know the mysteries 25 and and six now uh they're coming to the lord he's coming the bible says that the kingdom of heaven is like until 10 virgins amen y'all understand the story amen which took the lamps and went forward to meet the bridegroom are you with me we find that the story picks up some took oil and some in the vessel with their lamps and some just had all in their lamps are you with me so in the oil represent the holy ghost amen see there are many anointed ones in end times amen anointed once in the end time amen i'm gonna tell you something many many people said seed does not persecute seed are you with me but that's just a saying and a phrase when it comes to revelation time amen some people love their brother but hate their sister some people love their sister hate their brother you with me amen but seed cannot persecute seed because amen you have that god pain in you amen let god pay love amen praise god you do not fear what man can do to you amen because you have a god pain in you amen so that oh lord i can't let me go head on let god pay love god's love dwells in you amen and if god love dwells in you you got to stop thinking like a man acting like a man you got to act like sons and daughters of god if you don't know who you are amen how you expect the preacher to tell you who you are and you get excited because the preacher tell you you are bride but if you down in your soul not in your spirit nothing has quickened you and identified who you are to you as an investor as an individual that must be an intelligent down in you that speaks to your heart to identify to you that you are sons and daughters of god and because you know who you are you behave yourself as sons and daughters of god your conduct will be a conduct as becoming holiness you have a godly character you cannot help it it doesn't matter amen you know when when folk can do stuff to you and say stuff about you to make your character different and make you certain certain things make you act a certain way that means that god is still working on you are you up man so when uh you know whatever they did to jesus they did everything they spit on him they they whipped him and they did everything to him but he stayed loving them he loved them enough honestly from his heart he said forgive him somebody spit on you honestly from your heart will you say brother i forgive you or you spit back on them i never spit on nobody they spit on me i just said forgive him give you brother somebody says somebody said hey you know someone someone said something something about you well i i know that i i know this and i know that that the god was just testing you out they told you a lot you know they told you a lie and you believed the lie well i you didn't check it out cause if you checked it out say come here brother come here sister and and brother sister you know they said something about you here they are right here you know and he said oh okay they said so he said get the people ready for the coming of the lord you ain't ready to go nowhere if you can't go and get stuff straight with your brother and sister are you with me how you gonna go to heaven you can't get straightened out with your brother and sister y'all gonna get up in heaven and get it all straight [Music] you know i told some of the families and they said bro we going i told brother daniel he said well i'm going i said daniel if you got anything against anybody in me church come get it straight before you leave so she reading keith said it was going i said you got anything against me anybody in the church get it straight before you leave i and they said no no brethren no russia i said okay i just want everybody don't leave your brother and sister if they got something wrong with them make sure you help them get it straight are you with me so i want you you to know that whatever you got against anybody you gotta keep you out of heaven if you got something in your heart against somebody you have to get everything straight now before you leave here because once you leave here you can't get it straight no more the coming of the lord we must get ourselves straight at the coming of the lord for the coming of the lord draws are you with me so i'm saying when god come back if you ain't straight you ain't gonna get straight if i ain't straight and you didn't help me and tell me then god gonna hold you accountable are you with me if you think uh something wrong and you see something wrong with a brother or sister go to that brother and sister and tell them amen and if they don't get it straight here on the earth you know what i i i what i what i promise the lord that i'm gonna do if y'all don't straighten out and do kind of crazy stuff i'ma call your name on the on the screen see what i'm saying because if you tell me the truth i'ma tell it okay so don't what you say ain't the truth see what i'm saying then that's only on you it ain't gonna be on me because somebody said well brother simmer did you say that what said over there are you with me because if we do things decently in order and right it ought to not be it ought to be all right to see it are you with me when we christians we ain't got no secrets are you with me we gotta cover up hey don't don't let nobody know there's no letter but no you're christian you walk in the light ain't no darkness amen all things are naked and open before the eyes of him whom we have to do when you got the love of god in your heart you know what i'm saying it's all right let's let's be open one with another amen and god will you'll see a church that's blossoming in the spirit and in the love of god but when this can say something about that one now we can say something about doubt and somehow they can say something about well you won't have you what you have is mass chaos people can't get healed they can't get delivered why because my friend my buddy you know what i'm saying this is not friend buddy buddy and friendship we got to get ready for what the coming of the lord until we can go to our brother our sister and get things straight now you will not meet the lord in peace are you with me and i don't want to be responsible for your soul at the end of the road and i gotta give a count for you and you are acting up and when i tell you the truth and you don't do it then i'm gonna hold you responsible i said lord i done what you said do i went and i told them what the words say but they said that i know what the words say but i'm gonna do what i the spirit told me to do can't you see so many people doing what the spirit said do instead of what the words they do will god ever would he ever do something contrary to his word and say the spirit told me to do something contrary to the word okay brother and sister because the spirit and the word are what they're one okay the coming of the lord the coming of the lord draw it now matthew 25 and 6. it's late i don't know what's going to happen over there in the middle east brother and sister it might be later than we think if it is judgment

with me you rebuke them straight they say i'm going to tell my mom on you grown folk go and tell a mama you know and y'all don't believe that grown folk go tell everybody you have what the preacher said you know what the uh oh y'all can't you know what i'm saying i said you got to be the street you got to pray you got to understand where that person is before you address that person you just can't say what you want to say do it like you want to do it you got to pray to god give your skill give you wisdom give you guidance because people you you don't want to lose a person you're trying to win a person you don't want to lose a soul you're trying to save a soul so you don't say harsh in any kind of way uh if they see they see then you don't care how you talk to you you you got children that you're raising today amen that you got to sit down and you got to pray about how do i deal with this child you know what i'm saying and you know i got children that i got to pray about you know

than i can oh you would be so it ain't easy today it's not easy being a parent it's not easy being a preacher a pastor especially it's not an easy job it's very difficult in this hour that we're living in are you with me let me do jesus brother says y'all got to pray this thing too life is short and the coming of the lord is close i believe it's really really really really close and i believe if i if i don't really make it clear to you that you must get a hold of god if i don't make it really clear that nothing in this world is worth your soul being lost off are you with me nothing anybody say to you or say about you can cost you your soul you let folks say what they say do what they want you know what i'm saying and you just love them i was telling the pastor of the day he said so-and-so so it's on this i said don't mess with that we ain't got time we're too old to be messing with stuff if it's a mess let it you know leave it alone let god handle that work it out see what i'm saying but sometimes you you want to you want to tangle with stuff i said sometimes you might make it messier than what it is so sometimes you leave it in the hand of the law and let's see how let's let god handle stuff you know let's not just jump in something because you can be jumping in what you know he said oh okay okay i'll do that see that's what we got to do a lot of things we got to pray that god can handle it better than you can pray hard pray like you got you want to answer real like you want god to come on the scene you know you can pray that god changed somebody and god might end up changing you amen you might think that person wrong but you got to be honest and sincere and loving them and you love them enough and you pray for them enough and you love them god if if you wrong god straighten you out if they're wrong god can change them you love them keep loving them okay the 14th verse jude ain't it also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the what the lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints that is the lord is coming he said with seven from adam enoch was the seventh from adam isn't that right enough was translated amen he said to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them all their ungodly deeds which have ungodly they that have ungodly committed and of all their hard speech which ungodly sinners have spoken against him these are mammals come on let me tell you this condition of people in it i'm going to tell you it's just like it was in egypt these are mammals now i didn't say that brother friend i didn't say that dinner it's the book the book said that right these are what marvelous and what think about the next time you complain and what you're complaining about do you remember the church in the wilderness there was mumblings and what next time you i wonder why the pastor doing this one why they can't do that one way they singing that song so don't go where you singing that song from wonder woman y'all got to stop mumbling and start praying stop complaining get on your knees pray are you with me god will make us better if you pray for us if you don't pray for us that's why we invite shame you ain't praying for us you're mumbling you're complaining isn't that right instead of praying pray walking after their own what people are more concerned about their lust and their mouth speaking what the grace where having men and what person in admiration because of what because of advantages but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of the lord jesus christ how that they told you that that should be what marcus and what who should walk after their own what ungodly lust okay these be they who separate what separate themselves essentials
