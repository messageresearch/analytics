pray you bless now and touch these Special Needs in Jesus Christ name bless your word this morning in Jesus name amen second Corinthians I guess Caleb going to help me this morning uh reading uh 2 Corinthians 4 and I'm just going to go straight to the point the 17th verse it says 2 Corinthians 4 and 175 light afflictions which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory thank God while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which do not which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal may God bless you to read this word you may be seated want to talk about looking unto the Unseen as I was praying I was I was just thinking about uh uh this morning about uh uh Simon the Sorcerer wanted to buy the Holy Ghost amen and I was thinking you can't bu the Holy Ghost but he thought that as he saw uh the Apostle lay hands on the people and they received the Holy Ghost down in Samaran he wanted to BU it's not for sale the Holy Ghost is not for sale amen some people want to abide their way to heaven or work their way to heaven but you can't do it true amen you can't buy and you can't work your way to heaven amen some people said you know may the work I done speak for me amen amen May the life I live speak for me amen are you with me but we understand to a real Christian they can't work but he said we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works amen it's not the good we've done it's him that's done it amen he said my father hither to work so I work amen so he wasn't giving himself any credit for the things that were being done in Jesus life but he gave all the credit to God amen amen and as a Christian we give all the glory and all the credit to God for whatever is done amen amen a real Christian going to always praise the Lord amen lord it's you that's done it we haven't done anything and we can't do anything Amen to amen that we can glory in the Bible says let in his man Glory let him glory in the Lord amen so Simon amen seeing that he was a sorcerer amen working Witchcraft and had Bewitched the people thought he had everything under control amen but when uh philli come down preaching amen the kingdom of God Amen it was Revival in the city amen praise God and I said Lord you can't bu you can't buy the Holy Ghost then I thought about the there was two trees in the garden the tree that that were very interested because he put emphases on the tree of a life that was in the midst it was probably plenty of other trees but the Bible put emphasis on the tree of life and the tree of knowledge and good and evil amen and these true trees amen go all the way through until the coming of the Lord tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I'm just giving you pre before I get to the message the Tree of Life these are the things that was going through the tree of life and and the tree of a knowledge of Good and Evil I find that amen he the prophet of God said branches intertwine that's right you know what I'm saying so it it I was saying in uh thst night in Mullin if it was possible am if it was possible he he dece the very El but he said that he shorten the days for the elect sake God has to short these days if if he didn't short the days he said no flush be saved amen amen nobody would be saved if God did not shorten the days so God had to come by and shorten the days that any and for you and I to be saved things that's going on right now if God don't shorten the days nobody going to be saved amen but God short the days for the elect sake so by the grace of God the tree I find that as it was in the Garden of Eden so it is today people are more interested in the knowledge than they're interested in life people go to church and they're more interested in going to church to get knowledge than to get life life amen comes simply amen it's so simple but knowledge makes people puffed up and make them have have a lot of Pride about themselves but life is something that God gives amen are you with me Jesus said he didn't come to impress anybody he said I come that they might have what life that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly amen amen praise God now two those that are looking at this life they fail to see need the real genuine life that's called eternal life amen amen as long as you look at this world and this real and amen you can't see the Unseen World amen but there's a world that eyes can't see amen amen that's the Unseen the things that are Eternal are unseen amen but you notice that Eve saw the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and she ate are you with me people are still eating off that tree okay let me go on the knowledge the Unseen Rim the Unseen Rim we live in a world that operates by five senses right see hear taste whatever smell what feel are you with me amen you live in that realm right amen but there's another real we call the six sense not the five cense the six sense which is Faith in Hebrews 11 said faith is the substance of things hopeful it is the evidence of Things noten Not Seen amen Hebrews 11 there and um the one we just read I mean we just quoted but the second verse Hebrews 11 and 2 it went on to say for by faith I mean but for by it the elders attain a good report now the next verse says uh through faith we understand that the what the World by the word God I want you to know something we got to look to the Unseen amen because God did this amen amen by faith but we're so caught up in this world in this Dimension that we're so caught up Amen in in the things that not really real [Music] they're not really real and this is the you know the prophet of God said this is Satan eating amen this is what the devil made amen the make you to the thirst after the The Wanted and desire to have this right here amen took Jesus up on a high mountain said all this will I give to you if showing them all the kingdoms of the world but Jesus wasn't looking at that because he looked to the Unseen why because he knew that my kingdom is not of this world Amen because he knew it was another world the Unseen World amen there's Another Place Another Dimension that he was looking at so you can show me what the five sentence can see but I can look beyond that am amen brothers and sisters we got to look Beyond amen amen that as we were saying look beyond the curtains of time amen and look at eternity what it means amen so here we are looking he said through faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God it took Faith to bring the world into existence am it took the word of God praise God and so we so that the things which the things which are what seen seen were not made of what the things that do appear praise God the devil would have you to to be caught up in the things that have seen amen but praise God I want to look to how did how did these things get here the things that was are seen got here by faith God said let there be and it was amen the word of God spoken into existence praise God now amen you got to have enough Faith to believe in the Unseen amen the Bible said we walk by faith not by I I got to get there if I can this morning we walk by faith not by s am amen but how can see you know there in in in in our spirit man the five s i mean the five uh things to contact imagination reason conscious and so forth and a lot of times what we imagine praise God I can imagine you know and uh affection how we uh uh folks have a feeling of infection amen memory the devil want you to get caught up but down in the soul it operates on faith a doubt I mean if you doubt God you never see him amen but if you going to see God you got to see him by faith amen but he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is the rewarder of them that de see Thomas said except I see him see we all about Sin we we ain't going to believe but we don't see I ain't believing in what I see the lon I see it but believe it is not sin you got to believe God if you don't even see God because the invisible things of God have really seen by the things which are amen but it appear praise God so we don't have to see him to believe him we have to believe in the Sin tell somebody you have to believe the sin not see to believe not but believe to see to see amen are you with me does it make any kind of sense if you don't believe even how you going to see him but he that cometh to God must believe that he is oh Lord we're concerned so much about the carnal and the natural right he said there's no condemnation to them that were that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the what flesh but after the spirit for the LA of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of what s sin and death amen see when uh eve took up the tree of knowledge and good and evil it caused death and it does the day she began to walk by what sight she walked by what sight she saw amen and what we see is what we get somebody said what you see is what you get I'm for real I I'm not putting on what you see is what you get amen praise God I don't want that what I see I don't want to get that what I see I'm real what you see is what you get amen but a lot of people amen realizing that amen you don't see the heart of the person you might see am amen the outside share of what they trying to uh personify amen amen what they trying to get you to know you don't know them amen but they trying to get you to know what they want you to know are you up me because what you see amen you probably find out I ain't I didn't get what I saw amen I got a a somebody that was impersonating yes amen praise God so a lot of Christians are impersonating Christianity they're not really truly from the heart real genuine Christian they say I believe amen the message I believe the word but they don't really believe it because their life amen praise God I said the apple is not the tree but the Apple tell me what kind of tree it is amen amen amen are you with me amen praise God I I I tell you amen praise God it it it it Apple not an orange isn't that right amen so I'm not expecting amen when I bite into the Apple amen the orange juice to come out of it amen are you with me amen so what I'm saying is amen the tree is known by his what fruit fruit praise God you might claim to be a Christian you might say you're a Christian you might say you're a Believer but am pray you got to look at what the word of God says God I believe your word amen I'm not walking by what I feel or what I think or what somebody told me but Lord I walk by faith in your word amen I put my confidence in your word amen amen I'm here amen because the word of God brought me here the life I live I live by the faith for the Son of God who gave himself for me how do you know he did it I know he did it why because I am a representative of it I am an ambassador in Christ for Christ amen he done it for me amen the who I am today is because he made me who I am I couldn't do it myself praise God hallelujah I was in a prison I was in bondage to my flesh Amen to the S seen rim to this visible visible real but one day I heard the word of God Amen I heard that Jesus wanted to deliver me from this bondage of sin amen that Jesus died for me amen I heard it at plenty of time but I didn't hear it I didn't have to hear it right but one time you could to hear a thousand times but when amen when God Amen begin to Echo into you it didn't mean something all the other times you heard it amen but you didn't believe it amen but when you truly believe it something take place does a change come about does a life change and experience what you hear and believe it in your heart something an aner down in Hallelujah I ain't no more sinner but Christ has come into my life praise God and he's brought about a change in my life I ain't no more what I used to be amen I don't do what I used to do why because something got a hold to me amen I said something got a hold to me God got a hold to me I'm glad he did not the church not the preacher but [Applause] God thank God that there a true and living God you don't see but you see the results amen the result is that you got Believers somebody believe God today somebody said I believe God he bought the change in me can I get a witness anybody know what I'm talking about Hallelujah he'll change your life Hallelujah he'll do it for you praise God say why you excited what you screaming about I can't help myself praise God Amen cuz he bought a changer amen amen praise God look unto the Unseen amen let me try to um go back kale with me 4 and 8 looking into the Unseen brother sister sometime we looking you know the
