[37:05] of the end I believe we're at
[37:09] that
[37:12] time so Matthew 25 and one it says then
[37:17] shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like unto
[37:20] 10 virgins which took their lamps and
[37:23] went forth to meet the
[37:25] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[37:28] and five of them were
[37:31] foolish they that were foolish took
[37:34] their lamps and took no o with their
[37:38] lamps not enough just to come to
[37:43] church but the the wise took allil in
[37:46] their vessel with their
[37:48] lamps while the bridegroom T they all
[37:53] what slumbered and sleeping you got to
[37:56] wake up W
[37:57] up wake
[38:00] up

[38:04] wake
[38:05] up wake up amen don't sleep now
[38:11] amen and at midnight there was a
[38:15] what midnight there was a cry made
[38:17] behold
[38:19] what rise come go yah to meet him then
[38:23] all those virgins arose and what
[38:28] what it's triming lamp time trim
[38:33] it and the foolish said unto the wise
[38:36] give us of your
[38:38] A for our lamps are G
[38:42] out what a Time midnight and your lamp's
[38:46] gone
[38:48] out no more light your light is not
[38:52] shining but the wise answer said not so
[38:56] so least there be not enough for us and
[38:59] you but go ye rather to them that sell

[39:05] yourself and while they went to buy what
[39:11] happened and they that were
[39:13] ready went in with him to the marriage
[39:18] and the door was what the door was shut
[39:22] God bless you readers word you may be
[39:25] seated
[39:28] if I can just talk to you a little bit
[39:30] this
[39:32] morning I know you're familiar with the
[39:35] Midnight
[39:37] Cry we will understand that there was a
[39:41] midnight
[39:42] before and then that
[39:45] midnight it was midnight for the Jewish
[39:48] Jewish
[39:51] Jews and in the midnight for the Jews
[39:54] let's look at the midnight for the Jews
[39:57] we said the Old Testament was types and
[39:59] shadows of the real thing what was it to
[40:03] come as the
[40:05] Jews they had the church in the
[40:07] wilderness they had a
[40:09] church and the Jews had a Midnight
[40:13] Cry the Jews had
[40:16] balum the church has a
[40:19] balum the Jews had
[40:22] Jezebel the church has a
[40:25] jezebel Jews had a
[40:27] Babylon the church has mystery
[40:30] Babylon are you with me so here we are
[40:34] in the church ages we're at the End of
[40:36] the
[40:38] Age Midnight Cry what is this cry all
[40:41] about let's see what the cry was then
[40:43] then we understand what the cry is now
[40:47] should at midnight should we have a cry
[40:51] they had a
[40:53] cry the Bible said Jesus Christ the same
[40:56] yes today and the day and
[40:59] forever and God would not bring uh
[41:01] judgment unless he what warn
[41:05] you God warns you before
[41:08] judgment if God didn't warn you then why

[1:05:08] their tithes and offering but they don't
[1:05:10] want
[1:05:11] God don't want
[1:05:13] God because the god that they want is a
[1:05:16] God that's going to satisfy them because
[1:05:19] they know God I know God nobody can't

[1:13:14] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:13:18] and the disobedient to the wisdom of
[1:13:20] just and to what Make Ready a a people
[1:13:26] what see John that's midnight the Jews
[1:13:30] was getting ready Jerusalem rejected
[1:13:33] Jesus Christ and Jerusalem had the
[1:13:37] armies compassed about Jerusalem and
[1:13:40] Jerusalem was trotten down by the
[1:13:44] Gentiles the blood uh came out of the
[1:13:47] city up until the horse Bridal in ad70
[1:13:51] why because they
[1:13:52] rejected
[1:13:54] their day The Voice tried to warn them
[1:13:57] and get them prepared to meet Jesus
[1:13:59] Christ but they did not take
[1:14:04] heed and to this hour and to this day
[1:14:07] the Jews as a whole has rejected Jesus
[1:14:10] Christ as their
[1:14:12] Messiah but to us as Gentiles we say we
[1:14:15] believe that Jesus is God we believe
[1:14:17] that he's the Messiah he's Lord all we
[1:14:20] do is
[1:14:22] hypocrite as a

[1:24:09] church I got God I know God oh Lord but
[1:24:15] the woman said he told me all
[1:24:17] things God is trying to penetrate some
[1:24:20] Spirits penetrate our heart and trying
[1:24:23] to give us something to recognize that
[1:24:25] Elijah has come the voice uh Midnight
[1:24:28] Cry voice has come in our day to turn
[1:24:30] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:24:32] faith of the apostolic fathers back to
[1:24:35] the word amen but yet the people look at
[1:24:38] him and say who is this I don't know who
[1:24:41] this is that was the voice some one
[1:24:44] crying in the wilderness getting you
[1:24:46] ready for the
[1:24:48] Lord are you with me God is getting us
[1:24:51] ready for for the
[1:24:53] Rapture brother and sister the message

[1:24:59] out of here yet we don't want to believe
[1:25:02] behold I sent my
[1:25:04] messenger he did it to the Jews what
[1:25:07] about you and I as Gentile bride could
[1:25:10] God wouldn't God do for us what he did
[1:25:12] for them but what kind of attitude
[1:25:15] should we have H I don't
[1:25:20] know they said to him
[1:25:22] how said then that the stries that El
[1:25:26] must
[1:25:28] first
[1:25:30] come see sometimes people are looking
[1:25:33] for Elijah to
[1:25:35] come that's that's what the scribe
[1:25:38] say how did they say El must first come
[1:25:41] and restore all things he said he come
[1:25:44] already and you did to him whatsoever
[1:25:47] you
[1:25:48] listed you killed them he come and you
[1:25:51] killed them
