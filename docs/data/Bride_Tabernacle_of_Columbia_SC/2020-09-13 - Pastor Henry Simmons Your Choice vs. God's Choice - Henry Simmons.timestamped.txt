[46:36] my life
[46:42] running for my life amen
[46:48] so in as we
[46:54] have choices that we make
[46:58] this morning we must understand that
[47:03] there's a judgment
[47:05] falling amid the decisions that you and
[47:10] i make
[47:13] and usually you and i make the wrong
[47:16] choices
[47:20] and as we look at
[47:23] the book of saint john 15
[47:31] 16 15 16.
[47:41] and i want to look at this verse here
[47:43] for a moment
[47:45] it says
[47:51] henceforth excuse me
[47:54] ye have not chosen me
[47:57] your choice versus god's choice
[48:01] you have not chosen me
[48:05] we're understanding that
[48:09] amen many choices that we make
[48:13] we make the wrong choices
[48:17] but the ultimate choice is not for you
[48:19] to make it's for god to make
[48:24] and god has before the foundation of the
[48:28] world
[48:28] chose you
[48:32] he made a decision whom he will choose
[48:36] because he was empath because him being
[48:39] all-knowing
[48:43] could make the right choice because he
[48:46] knew the end from the beginning
[48:50] and we can't tell god god you made a
[48:52] mistake when you chose me
[48:56] you're here because you are a product of
[48:58] god's chosen
[49:01] it wasn't your decision to be saved or
[49:03] to be
[49:05] amen the elect of god or the bride of
[49:08] jesus christ what god made
[49:10] amen in his full knowledge he for dane
[49:14] you before the foundation of the world
[49:19] amen and god did not make a mistake
[49:25] shall the things form say to him that
[49:27] form him
[49:28] why has thou made me thus has the power
[49:32] not power over the clay
[49:35] amen and we are in god's hand
[49:40] he's molding us and making us into his
[49:42] image and into his likeness
[49:45] and we must understand amen that you
[49:49] and i were god's choice amen
[49:54] but you try to make your own way
[49:58] and your own choosing
[50:02] which will only bring damnation to your
[50:05] soul
[50:07] but i will surrender to the will of god
[50:13] that we'll let go and let god have
[50:16] our lives
[50:20] that we'll start trying to control
[50:24] our destiny
[50:27] but let god amen who predestinated us
[50:33] amen unto the adoptions of sons
[50:37] and daughters of god
[50:40] let him have the preeminence in our
[50:42] lives
[50:45] amen you can have a much smoother ride
[50:49] through life
[50:53] but if you wanted to be rough and bumpy
[50:57] and you want a lot of clarity and
[51:00] trouble
[51:02] to come upon your life
[51:05] then go head on and try to ruin it for
[51:09] yourself
[51:11] you tried to do it your way
[51:16] amen because he said your ways are not
[51:19] my ways
[51:21] and your thoughts are not mine
[51:25] god is so high above
[51:29] so you got to realize amen your thoughts
[51:32] is no good
[51:36] so forget about how you think and what
[51:39] you think because
[51:41] amen you are amen
[51:46] you're just messing making a mess of
[51:47] things
[51:49] the trouble with man he tried to think
[51:53] that he's something when he's nothing
[51:57] he get caught up in his own little world
[52:00] of thinking that he's somebody special
[52:04] but who are you when we got a creator
[52:08] that created the sun
[52:09] and the moon and the universe
[52:13] and the world and all things that
[52:15] they're in
[52:17] your little peacock marine
[52:25] amen trying to compete with the amen
[52:28] the mind of god
[52:31] the great empathy
[52:35] god that has no beginning and no end
[52:40] god that got all power in his hand
[52:43] yet we thank ourselves something special
[52:47] that we can contend with god
[52:51] and try to challenge god's will
[52:54] and purpose for our lives
[52:58] we try to run our own life
[53:02] only to make a mess of things
[53:05] god bless you this morning trust that
[53:08] you'll stop for a minute
[53:11] and think about where you come from and
[53:13] where you're going
[53:17] amen god brought you from nowhere to
[53:20] somewhere
[53:22] come on they meant god brought him for
[53:26] nothing to something
[53:30] amen for when you did not exist god
[53:33] brought you into existence
[53:37] are you with me but you and i
[53:40] have been told that amen as a thought
[53:43] and as an
[53:44] attribute in the mind of god we were
[53:46] there
[53:50] but for the foundation of the world
[53:52] because i can identify with the
[53:55] attributes of god
[53:56] and knowing that i was a part of god's
[53:59] thinking
[54:03] even before the world began
[54:07] are you with me
[54:11] so he says here
[54:17] you have not chosen me but i've chosen
[54:19] you and ordain you
[54:20] that you should go forth and bring forth
[54:22] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[54:25] that whatsoever you shall ask
[54:29] the father in my name he will he may
[54:32] what
[54:34] he may give it you amen but you got to
[54:38] identify
[54:40] amen that i recognize that god you chose
[54:45] me
[54:46] somebody said lord will you lead me i'll
[54:49] follow
[54:50] the bible said they that are led by the
[54:53] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[54:56] you know i was just looking back
[55:02] in my life and trying to find out what
[55:05] how did i get
[55:06] where i am
[55:09] and i started listening from my
[55:11] beginning where
[55:13] god really started dealing with me that
[55:15] i heard
[55:18] that small steel voice
[55:23] that god spoke to me and i knew
[55:27] it was god
[55:31] then when i began to go through
[55:34] certain tests and certain trials in my
[55:36] life
[55:38] i heard that voice speak again to take
[55:40] me to my death
[55:42] next destination
[55:47] i did not argue with the voice of god
[55:52] somebody said i was not disobedient to
[55:54] the heavenly
[55:58] see sometimes we're disobedient when god
[56:01] speak and you know it's god
[56:05] but i was not disobedient when i heard
[56:08] that voice i knew that was god
[56:11] that called me out of the world and
[56:13] saved me
[56:17] it came down to god revealing the word
[56:20] for this day i knew that was god
[56:25] so i had to go back in the midst of the
[56:27] world and the chaos that's going on
[56:30] with the things that god is sending this
[56:32] day in this hour
[56:35] you had to go back and see where you
[56:37] started
[56:42] god it was you that spoke to me and said
[56:48] this is my servant
[56:53] you know sometimes we have to be
[56:56] reassured
[56:58] amen because things could get kind of
[57:00] chaotic sometimes
[57:03] even concerning your salvation things
[57:06] could get kind of chaotic sometimes
[57:08] things can get kind of shook up sometime
[57:11] and
[57:11] we can count on the lord amen
[57:15] amen where are you lord
[57:18] i need your lord
[57:22] you need him to speak to you lucky spoke
[57:24] to you in time past
[57:29] god knows how to lead you he know how to
[57:31] guard you
[57:34] sometimes we have to settle down and be
[57:36] still and know that i'm god
[57:41] so god you that spoke to me time past
[57:44] speak to me now
[57:48] i need to hear your voice i need your
[57:50] leadership
[57:52] i need you to guide me through these
[57:55] treacherous waters
[57:59] time like these amen we need the lord
[58:06] somebody said if we haven't needed the
[58:07] lord before
[58:09] we sure do need him now
[58:13] brother sister i'm not depending on
[58:16] or somebody else revelation
[58:20] i'm not dependent on the church
[58:22] revelation amen

[58:25] revelation you got to get your own
[58:28] revelation

[58:33] individual

[1:06:56] that were for known of god

[1:07:01] god
[1:07:02] they were here when god called

[1:14:17] we beseech you by the mercies of god
[1:14:21] amen that you present your bodies
[1:14:24] a living sacrifice amen
[1:14:28] as i go back to peter for a moment i got
[1:14:30] to close
[1:14:31] but by the grace of god he says
[1:14:35] beloved thinking not strange
[1:14:40] i'm telling you what i've been
[1:14:45] seeing with folks they're doing just the
[1:14:48] opposite
[1:14:53] but you know why they're doing the
[1:14:54] opposite as a whole
[1:14:59] perhaps they're not to be loved
[1:15:06] if you're the beloved of god
[1:15:09] then he's admonishing you and he's
[1:15:12] saying to you
[1:15:14] think it not strains
[1:15:17] are you with me but the
[1:15:21] way we speak the way
[1:15:24] we conduct ourselves and the way we
[1:15:27] are talking it's just saying that
[1:15:31] it's a true sign overlooked
[1:15:34] the things that god has done in this
[1:15:36] hour and this day
[1:15:38] i believe we missed the whole thing
[1:15:43] i believe we'll miss the sign that god
[1:15:46] has given us to this generation
[1:15:50] because our way we conduct our lives and
[1:15:53] the way we handle
[1:15:55] our uh our suffering our trials and
[1:15:59] the way we deal with our situations and
[1:16:01] our problems and our attitude
[1:16:03] towards the world and our attitude
[1:16:05] towards one another
[1:16:07] causes us to recognize that something is
[1:16:10] wrong
[1:16:12] we think it's strange that it's not
[1:16:14] supposed to happen this way
[1:16:16] amen it's supposed to happen the way
[1:16:19] it's happening
[1:16:20] to you and the reason why you're not
[1:16:23] passing the test because you're thinking
[1:16:25] it's strange
[1:16:29] and he said think it not strange
[1:16:32] isn't that right praise god why did this
[1:16:35] have to be for me
[1:16:37] why i have to go through this and why i
[1:16:39] had to go through that
[1:16:41] why didn't what did i do wrong oh
[1:16:43] thinking not strange
[1:16:47] come on somebody
[1:16:50] see if we do what the words say
[1:16:53] and then we'll get the results that the
[1:16:55] words say we should have
[1:16:58] amen you have been chosen of god
[1:17:02] god chose you for your trial
[1:17:06] and he chose the tribe for you to
[1:17:09] perfect you
[1:17:12] are you with me so when you're going
[1:17:14] through your tests and your trial
[1:17:16] don't think it's strange because this is
[1:17:20] your perfection
[1:17:22] amen but you got to have the right
[1:17:26] mental attitude towards the word
[1:17:29] to get the blessings for me to draw amen
[1:17:32] your dividend amen
[1:17:35] god wants to add amen to your faith
[1:17:39] virtue and god wants to add
[1:17:43] to your virtue amen god want to take you
[1:17:46] up to knowledge temporary and so forth
[1:17:48] patience and amen he want to take you up
[1:17:51] to the statue of a perfect man but god
[1:17:54] cannot take you into his divine nature
[1:17:56] except you recognize that his divine
[1:17:58] nature is working through
[1:18:00] your faith through your virtue to your
[1:18:02] patient
[1:18:06] amen god has taken you up
[1:18:10] into a place of a secret place
[1:18:14] taking you to the innervale taking you
[1:18:16] into the holy of holies
[1:18:19] amen god is taking you to a higher level
[1:18:22] but you must learn to adjust
[1:18:25] amen every trial and every test don't
[1:18:28] think it's strange
[1:18:29] but you got to conduct yourself as
[1:18:32] though amen

[1:19:39] sugar diabetes
[1:19:40] i don't consider that

[1:19:49] but i know that with the strikes
[1:19:53] i'm here so if i start praising god
[1:19:58] but not for what i see what what i
[1:20:00] believe
[1:20:02] amen what the word said about it and
[1:20:05] what god told me
[1:20:08] but it had to be revealed to you by

[1:20:17] for faith is the substance i want my
[1:20:19] substance
