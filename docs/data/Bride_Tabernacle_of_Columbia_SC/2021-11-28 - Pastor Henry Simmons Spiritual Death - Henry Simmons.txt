christ wonderful name amen the book of revelation the sixth chapter we thank god we're in a critical time in a troubled time somebody called it perilous times in the last days dangerous times would come perilous times should come praise god we're in those perilous times praise god and i i thought i would use the thought what's next but we thought about it and we're going to use spiritual death this morning what's next spiritual death spiritual death says here it says in revelation 6 and 7 and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard a voice i heard the voice of the fourth beast saying come and see and i looked and beheld a pale horse and his name that set on him was death and hell followed with him and the power was given to him over the four parts of the earth the kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth may god bless the reasons where you may be seated spiritual death now the world attention has been caught by a virus they call it covet 19. and the virus that we want to identify this morning that spiritual death is covert 666 666 not covert 19. we're talking about spiritual death the virus that's attacking the whole world but being ignored the virus that's been overlooked covert 666 we know that the devil will have everybody attention focused in the wrong direction where he can do things that are on the line things that are working in the unseen while you looking at the scene the devil is working on the unseen realm folks are amen eyes are focused the bible said we walk not by f sight but we walk by faith not by sight said the weapons of our warfare are not cornered but they are mighty to god to the pulling down of strongholds i want to talk about your unseen enemy that is killing more than covet 19 but covet 666 spiritual death and striking the world seem like the world is ignorant of the fact that they need to come together amen in this enemy that is destroying thousands and millions of souls that are in prison now yet we fail to recognize our greatest enemy spiritual death is setting in and people are blind to the fact that spiritually amen the world amen has gone to sleep they said the scientific world is saying that the virus is made by man and that the vaccine is killing more than the one that's living in the scientific world is baffling one way or another people don't know what to look for or look at whether they shall be revaccinated or whether they should not amen and they're hearing from the pulpit and from the preachers some are saying don't and some are saying do so people minds are being baffled they don't know which way to turn but let me as this pale horse rider rides in the last age and in the end time the hearts that rides it's pale because we had the white horse rider which is the first seal and we had the red horse rider and then we had the black horse rider but we noticed that the pale horse rider amen is a mixture of all three horse riders that makes the color pale are you up man so we're in that time in that season that amen spiritual depth has set in and in the thirty churches he said uh concerning the woman jezebel said to jezebel that i gave her space to repent of her fornication but she repented not oh he was cast into bed and will kill the children with death spiritual death are you with me because she repented not her fornication god gives us an opportunity to repent because man will not repent and spiritual death sets in god gives you and our opportunity to repent if we don't repent then spiritual death sets in are you with me so as the world is focusing on covet 19 and the church world is focusing in and saying oh god the different things and we'll uh understand that folks are amen either way it takes faith to take the vaccine and take faith not to take it you can choose to try to save your life and lose it and if you amen are focused on the right thing and not the wrong thing then you should value amen yo so more than this life but if you interested on saving this life then why aren't you interested in saving your soul if you would do something and whatever it takes to amen to live a little longer in this life because you know the ultimate amen you're not going to live but a few days as job said the man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble are you with me if you happen to live three school years and ten and by reason of strength four school years you lived a long time but there is a amen jesus said that i come he said the thief come to kill steal and destroy but he said i come that you might have a life and that you might have it more abundantly praise god i want you to know amen that spiritual death sets in eternal life it's on the other side of the chasm oh yes brother sister amen there's a and there's a vaccine they meant that kills the virus they mean uh uh there is an antidote that takes care then uh covert 666 and kill amen they meant that virus we call sin and sin amen when it sets in it'll cause spirits to death for the bible said the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life certain things i i won't say because amen uh i think i need a little series of teaching on it but i i'm just trying to give you just an uh a little bit of of what amen i'm dealing with this morning but it'll take a a a several lessons to sit down and talk to the church off the air and let's amen because amen i hope you understand because you're gonna have to read between the lines are you with me you got to understand that god amen is focusing in and got your attention i was telling caleb the other day when i thought on eternal life eternity and uh each it being a part a son of god that has eternal life i said what does that mean that you are actually have eternal life and him being the math major could understand that i'm talking about more than just words i'm talking about eternal life and and when we're talking about spiritual depth on the opposite side we're talking about eternal life where there is no depth and eternal life comes from oh let's go here in revelation 13 excuse me you got michael uh maybe i need a little read this morning praise god hallelujah eternal life amen now jesus said i come from god and i go to god he said i'm from above and you're from beneath and as i was praying this morning and i said oh how wonderful he is he said in john 1st john she said oh behold now are we the sons of god amen i i'm talking about the being the son of god that means you have a father and your father is god almighty and if you can walk and understand who you are praise god and you can walk with your head up i said eternal life resides in those that have been born again far amen you have the seed in you amen that you know amen that you've been born not of corruptible seed but incorruptible by the word of god we delivered and abided forever brother and sister he said he that believeth on me as the structure has said that out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water oh yes i'm talking about the holy ghost praise god we've gone into amen that we are going to mandate that you take the vaccine amen in order to work on your job in order to get a passport in order to travel oh yes it's been mandated on many of jobs in many places that you must take this in other words it's to save your life and help protect others and so folks are saying i don't see no harm in it and i'm not preaching on that but i want you to think about amen what's going on because it is setting the stage as i said from the beginning just that it shut down the whole world and has focused on the communist countries and also the capitalism and the whole world has been set down whether it's hindu buddha whether it's confucius whether it's mohammed or whatever the whole world will shut down for a moment i'm saying there's a vaccine in this uh virus covenant 19 amen has it has affected everybody that dwells on the face of the earth brother and sister i'm saying the stage have been set and we're living in a time that amen that if your eyes will open you'll know that something is going on not what you're saying but the unseen realm oh god there's something on the cover taking place and i know that you don't know what's going on brother and sister because if you knew what was going on you'll run for your life you'll get on your knees and start crying out to god god help me the only safe place is in jesus the only safe place to hide from cover 19 is in jesus are you with me and covert 666 is in jesus oh yes you need to run to jesus if you can hear he said he oh goodness let me see revelation 13 and 8 just read that for me please and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him yes whose names are not we're talking about the beasts antichrist oh what dwelling upon the earth all that dwelt upon the earth not some of them but what can y'all say all somebody said not me you know somebody said not me but read it again and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him to my not me you know the world think amen because folks go to church every sunday uh and through the weekend outside the wherever whenever you go to church or your synagogues or whatever you do religiously was amen but i said as the covenant 19 affected the whole world didn't matter whether you were a christian whether you were muslim whether you were hindu or whether you were a buddha it didn't matter amen it affected the whole world and covert 666 affects the whole world are you with me read whose names are not written uh-oh he said and all and what all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him worship him whose names are not written in the book of life whose names are what not y'all read it whose names or what not written in the what book of life in the book of life if your name is not written there you will are you foreign now your name got to be written there because when from the found of the lamb slain from the foundation from the foundation of the world that means before you were ever born that you were amen sons and daughters of god before you even knew who you were are you with me before you before the foundation of the world god foreknew you and saw you god knew that one day you would hear the voice you would hear the word and it would resonate with you it would be something inside of you i don't quite understand it but sure enough i believe it praise god there's something inside of you amen trying to find out who i am oh for what purpose am i living and why was i born well god had an eternal purpose and a plan for you god they forsoot you he foresaw you amen and when he saw you he saw your condition he saw you in need of his saving grace he knew that one day you will hear the force of god why you could not ignore it why because you were a gene [Music] amen you were an attribute you were thought and you were part of god in the beginning hallelujah and god knew that you were part of him and through amen nothing that you can do to shake yourself away from it amen praise god because my sheep they hear my voice amen praise god when the father calls i want to answer amen he called me one day and i'm glad that i was able to say amen yes lord i know you died from me i know you're shining your blood god i know you did it for me i don't care what others say and i just think jesus you're my lord you're my god you're my savior you're my father amen and i can say lord i'm glad i'm glad that i recognize that i'm a son of god hearing that praise god and i that you are daughters and sons of god and that god is your father amen and you're a part of him that's where you came from you're here not by accident but you have a purpose for living now god brought you here amen because you had a plan for you and god in the destiny that you should walk in amen god knew that hallelujah oh yes and he says the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world you know jesus amen came about 2 000 years ago but in god's mind amen he was slain in the god's mind don't you know god thoughts are eternal and in the mind of god the bible says he knows the end from the beginning are you with me god david amen tell daniel to look and i'm gonna show you four beasts i'm gonna show you babylon and i'm gonna show you me to purge and i'm gonna show you greece at alexander the great and i'm gonna show you rome and i'm gonna show you amen the stone healed out the mountain amen i'm going to show you the end of the world amen and he told daniel set up the book and then seal up the sands until the time of the end i believe we're in the end time and i believe that which is seal is open now i believe the book amen i believe middle persia has come and i believe that uh oh god gracious has come and now legend of the great has come and i believe that rome has come it still is are you with me how can you not amen when you are son and daughter of god these things should be amen understandable to you praise god you're not you're not ignorant of what satan is doing in this last day he's trying to divert your attention and trying to get you caught up with this life trying to save this this life and trying to have a few more days to live and forgetting about your soul are you with me so the preachers are more preaching uh for this and for that and and not knowing that there's a greater enemy that's on the rampage and amen are called and people are meant to die spiritually go right ahead caleb if any man has an ear let him hear now that's that's the purpose if you got an ear to hear let him hear if you if you don't have an ear you can never hear because jesus said no man can come to me first of all my father was in heaven drawing and if you if you got an ear to hear he said let him hear because a lot of people can listen but they can't hear are you up me and a lot of people can hear they meant naturally but spiritually it does nothing for them but he that has an ear to heal amen where you understand are you with me you understand that god as you may amen it's chosen you out of this evil and wicked world god has a plan for you amen he died for your sins to others it don't mean a thing amen in other words he died in to them it don't mean a thing and i believe that he didn't die in vain i believe his blood was shedded for you and i yes amen praise god but you got to have a ear to what amen can you hear amen are you are you the ones that believe the report in the arm of the lord has been revealed to you oh god go ahead he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patient and the faith of the saints the patient and faith of the saints brother and sister you must have patience to wait on god i'm gonna tell you something it's not many people that have patience but he says in your patient possess you your soul amen you must patiently wait on the lord amen sometimes we get tired of waiting on the lord and seem as though the lord don't care the bible says an account that the long shuffling of god is salvation god is waiting this wicked world is getting wickeder and wickeder but god is patient because he's long suffering if he didn't wait on you and i looked where we would be amen god was patient with us when we they turn our backs on him he didn't turn his back on us but he still was patiently waiting on us to come and give our lives to jesus are you with me god had a lot of patience with you aren't you glad he waited waited on you and i while we didn't want to listen we were ignoring him we would not hear him but god was patient long suffering go ahead on kill and i beheld another beast coming out of the earth now we know that america this is the united states of america the first beast came up out of the sea people multitudes nations and tongues this beast comes up not out of people nations multitudes and tongues this beast comes up out of earth this is the united states of america are you with me revelation 13 13 stars 13 stripes are you with me this is the united states of america let's say united states of america can we say that now where's america in the bible can a nation as great as america not be in the bible we know god can make god russian everybody else is in here well what about america she's here are you with me okay go ahead he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon two homes like a lamb remembered american buffalo two horns like a lamb are you with me then say was a lamb he had two horns what american buffalo amen it wasn't a nation multitude but it was out of the earth like a wilderness and it had two horns like a lamb remember the buffalo they met the head is up towards where the president's come out of harvard yale and not maine up that way most of the presidents come from that way and remember the feet are like texas and florida remember the heart like the bible belt south carolina and these religious times remember the backside was with california where all the field come out are you with me lack of lamb okay so here's america amen and how the god think about america and bible prophecy brother and sister if we don't wake up we'll wake up too late if we don't understand what's going on it'll be too late when you wake up it'll be too late amen but blessed are your eyes because you're seeing your ears because you're here are you with me because god could have you could have sat in church and shouted and danced in the spirit and forgot about your soul are you with me but when you hung and thirst after righteousness he said you shall be what feel but it's something inside of you just you just didn't want anything you didn't want to be fed anything amen you wanted to be fed the truth of god are you with me see some people they eat anything they're just happy to get anything amen but you don't want just anything you want the truth i want the pureness of the word i don't want anything i want the word okay so he says go come up out of the earth and hit what horns like a lamb and expect like a what now you remember america was very religious and very had a good foundation but after a while expect like a what dragon and you know satan is called the dragon the devil the serpent the devil it's called the dragon revelation 12. so here we are now it's specks like a dragon what is going on in america we have legalized sin and we have made sin acceptable and we spread sin all over the world and cause the nations if you if you want us to help you financially then you got to legalize sin too and if you don't legalize and they made if if you hate sin but not the sinner if you hate sin they said it's a hate crime to hate sin and people are fearful and scared for their life because they can't say anything about sin the preachers in the pulpit can't preach against sin no more because it's a hate crime see what they have done they've taken the bible amen and if you preach the word like it's written they say you can't do that are you up there so brother and sister where do you stand are you do you want truth and are you willing to stand up for truth are you with me are you willing to compromise because sin has become legalized the laws have changed and made sin acceptable and in the schoolhouse you must accept sin and one of the major things that they're pushing on us is homosexuality are you with me and it you know nothing against the person themselves many of people amen didn't have nothing to do with that condition we we've also got to accept adultery you can have three four five wives you know those sins that's in the flesh such as that amen it's been acceptable the laws have been changed to make sin so well off to people can do it and feel no condemnation now because the law has legalized it oh you would be just like they legalized alcohol and it killed so many people but they legalize it now they're legalizing marijuana the next thing they'll legalize is what all drugs people already in bad shape the world already it's going crazy oh you look man so what is going on we're going to keep father and father in sin now instead of doing like minimal the king got the whole nation to repent because he no judgment is getting ready to strike the nation and judgment is striking the whole world instead of amen dealing with the problem that we need to repent the world needs to repent of the amen and turn back to god but they won't repent because god said i gave a space to repent and she repented not god gave you an eye space to repent in our lives but we don't want to repent we want to keep on doing what we're doing and we're going to say it's all right to do it are you up man we want to make sin legal because somebody else is doing it and somebody else is doing it and everybody's doing it so we want to legalize sin in our mind we want to make sin acceptable so the church don't do nothing about it the preacher won't preach against it amen the people amen if you try to rebuke it to get mad at you won't get mad at sin i'm not saying get mad at the center because the center sometimes is just a victim of circumstances you don't know why people are in the condition they're in you don't know what caused that so you don't hate the person you don't when you want to talk against the person amen well we're talking about sin praise god where god can amen set the captive free amen god can heal the brokenhearted god can change the lives of those that have been caught a victim and captive of sin are you with me god can handle it brothers and sisters it doesn't matter amen how it happened what happened in your life god can deliver oh yes he can amen and still amen coming to the one that can help us we don't be satisfied because we think that there's no remedy there's no vaccine there's no kill for my condition but it is i said god got to kill god got a vaccine that can wipe out sin praise god the blood of jesus is still available they admit i said the blood of jesus is still available praise god if the blood the bulls and goats and the ashes will help if that blood amen that was put on the dope holes in the lantern could keep the children of israel healed praise god amen i believe the blood of how much more the blood of jesus amen he can heal with his strikes you healed amen he was wounded father transgression bruised for our iniquities just targeting of our peace was upon him and with the strikes we're healed brother and sister god has a healing virtue and he wants to heal you amen all you got to do is accept him and he'll heal you it doesn't matter where it came from it doesn't matter amen how helpless we are but god will help the helpless amen i hope that you with me this morning i hope that you're understanding that god does care for you and that he does love you in spite of sin god does care for you he still loves you and we do too 12 go ahead on i got to get there i won't get there i got i got to conclude and push it go and he exercised all the power of the first beast before him and caused the earth and them which dwelt therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he dealth great wonder so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell in the earth what he does he does what don't be deceived brother and sister don't be deceived amen you might seek to save this life and this body i i'll covet 19 you know i mean deceiving but what about your soul how can people be so concerned about the body but they care less about their soul this body it's going to die anyway it's going to corrupt it gone anyway well what about your soul well you can spend eternity with god but you got to be chosen for this you got to be elected they met before the foundation of the world your name was written in that book and you got to believe that you got to know that god amen god he died for my sin my name was written there and that's why i want to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the mission of my sin and i want the holy ghost amen because if i receive the holy ghost god identifies that i'm his son i'm his daughter are you with me go ready he deceiveth them to dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which he which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should should be killed i'm gonna tell you something this thing gonna get a little bit difficult it's gonna turn from cover 19 to covert six six it's gonna turn after a while praise god because if cover 19 worked in covert six six years you're gonna are you with spiritual death sitting there oh you look man so this thing gonna take a little switch and a change and overnight you're gonna be sitting there and not knowing spiritually where you at just happened overnight you woke up in the morning and the whole world was shut down overnight are you with me and when this thing take a turn you're gonna sit around and say i thought the rapture would take place before the great tribulation or whatever and how come the antichrist is here and i didn't know he was how come this we're in this kind of condition what is going on because you didn't care about your soul you were so focusing on this life and the things of this world you were so focused on that till you lo you forgot all about your soul the bible says seek ye of what first what amen you know i was thanking the lord for uh brother chris chris trump he said that he put that scripture seek you first the kingdom of god and i said that's what god said seek ye first the kingdom of god is what and righteous they say what all the other things gonna be what think about it brother and sister see your soul if god ain't first in your life then where is he he won't accept any place but what i mean don't try to put him in any other position because he wants to be what he wants to be lord of your life he wants to be first and if he's not first he's not going to set up any other place are you with me i think he deserved to be first what about you i think god deserves all the honor all the glory amen because without him we can do what nothing so uh he's the one that keeping us alive if the devil had his way he'll kill you now just right now the devil will take you out but it's the mercy of god thank god for his mercy isn't that right thank god because he loved us and he gave himself for us and he watched over us day by day when we doing all our little stuff all in the craziness that we do god still love to still watch over still keep us why because he's got a lot of patience that we don't have are you with me but god loves us enough to be patient with us and to wait on us praise god god is already ready for you but god is waiting on you to get ready praise god he's not well god when the lord get ready for me coming to get he's been ready you just ain't ready are you you're not ready for god but god been ready for you a long time it's up to you to get ready he said be ready go go ahead i got to close and he had power to give life into the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he causes all both small and great causes what say it again oh oh go ahead both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads see the devil is working with your mind he already got the whole world he he did a test cover 19 tests and he got the minds of the what whole world amen told you look hard around and show that you got your vaccine are you with me so he's got the mind of he got the people focused on intensity it's all right to receive them all are you with me if i and then a natural amen we think it's all right amen and then it got to other people on the other side that said i ain't gonna take it the vaccine and they looking at the natural why the devil is working underneath with the spiritual happening something spiritual taking place while all this in the natural we're looking at the devil is working underneath in the spiritual realm praise god and the people are so busy looking at this awkward thing covert 19 today miss colbert 666. are you with me so underneath the thing the bible said if it was possible he'll deceive the very what and i don't think cover 19 could could deceive like that this thing gonna be so close to the real they meant that it was possible you could see the very leg isn't that right so the elect came in it's working with oh god so i'm saying the devil is work oh god and i think most of the religious and people are coming out saying i'm a prophet and i'm just some that don't take it dude i'm spiritual i miss i said lord have mercy the devil don't mind them out there fighting one fighting this way the other fighting that way but you you we're not ignorant thank god for mighty car four isn't that right thank god for revealing himself to us in the last day amen because if he had not amen our minds would be on one side of the other amen but we understand that it's a spiritual going on it's a spiritual application that is taking place in the world today amen and that this mark amen praise god in the hand forehead in the mark in the hand it's spiritual are you with me the pale horse rider is a mixture of political power religious power and
