[31:43] god is good amen
[31:48] tonight by god's grace we want to look
[31:50] at first chronicles
[31:51] first chronicles 17.
[31:56] very familiar
[32:01] [Music]
[32:11] first chronicles 17 and we'll begin at
[32:13] the first verse
[32:18] if you got it say amen and it reads
[32:22] now it came to pass as david sat in the
[32:24] house
[32:25] that david said to nathan the prophet lo
[32:28] i dwell
[32:29] in the house of cedars but the ark of
[32:31] the covenant of the lord remaineth under
[32:33] curtains
[32:34] then nathan said unto david do all that
[32:37] is in thine heart
[32:38] for god is with thee and it came to pass
[32:41] the same night
[32:42] that the lord that the word of the lord
[32:43] came to nathan saying
[32:45] go tell my servant go tell david my
[32:48] servant thus
[32:48] saith the lord thou shall not build me a
[32:51] house
[32:52] to dwell in you may be seated just read
[32:54] a little further down
[32:56] he said thou shall not build me a house
[32:59] to dwell in
[33:00] for i have not dwell in a house since
[33:03] the day that i
[33:04] brought up israel until this day
[33:08] but have gone from 10th to 10th and from
[33:11] one tabernacle to another
[33:13] whatsoever i walk with all israel
[33:16] spake i a word to any of the judges
[33:20] of israel whom i commanded to feed my
[33:23] people
[33:25] saying why have you not built me a house
[33:28] of cedars
[33:29] now therefore thus saith thou for now
[33:32] therefore thus shalt thou say until my
[33:34] servant david
[33:36] thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee
[33:38] from the sheep coat
[33:40] even from following the sheep and that
[33:42] thou
[33:43] should be a ruler over my people israel
[33:45] and i have been with thee
[33:47] whatsoever thou whatsoever thou has
[33:50] walked
[33:50] and have cut off all thine enemies from
[33:53] before thee
[33:54] and have made thee a name like the name
[33:57] of great men that are all
[33:58] that are in the earth also i will ordain
[34:01] a place for my people israel will plant
[34:03] them and they shall dwell in their place
[34:04] and shall be moved no more
[34:06] neither shall the children or the
[34:08] wickedness waste them anymore
[34:11] as at the beginning and since the time
[34:14] that i commanded the judges to walk over
[34:15] my people
[34:16] i mean to command the judges to be over
[34:19] my people
[34:20] israel moreover i will subdue all nine
[34:23] enemies
[34:24] furthermore i tell thee that the lord
[34:27] will build
[34:28] thee in house may god had a blessed
[34:31] arena of his word
[34:33] by god's grace just for a moment and i
[34:36] entitled
[34:37] something i was working with on sunday
[34:39] is god in simplicity
[34:41] and the sub topic the nature of god amen
[34:45] god and simplicity and the nature of god
[34:47] i says you know
[34:48] one thing about the lord god he never
[34:52] changes
[34:53] his mass i mean he always changes his
[34:55] mass but he never changes his nature
[34:58] his characteristics and who he is that
[35:00] makeup won't change he might change
[35:03] you know the the place to where some
[35:06] somewhat that he dwells in
[35:08] or or the mask but he never changes his
[35:11] nature
[35:12] who who god is he'll always be
[35:15] so we find that you know i says you know
[35:17] you can look throughout all the
[35:18] scriptures
[35:19] no matter throughout all the scriptures
[35:22] he was the same
[35:24] you know he was at one point god above
[35:26] us the pillar of fire
[35:27] and he was god with this and you know we
[35:30] know him
[35:31] as god in us today the holy ghost but no
[35:33] matter the dissertation of the nature
[35:35] he's still going to no matter the
[35:37] dispensation or the dwelling place his
[35:39] nature is still going to be the same how
[35:41] many believe that tonight
[35:42] so we find that i says you know it's a
[35:44] lot of characteristics
[35:46] and a lot of things that god has to
[35:49] display
[35:50] or that's attributes that's in him that
[35:52] we say that he wants to display
[35:54] that's why sometimes people say we
[35:57] question
[35:58] god or why certain things happen why god
[36:00] allows a minister once
[36:02] on what god allows we question sometime
[36:04] what god allows
[36:05] but god allows things to transpire
[36:08] sometimes because
[36:10] he's got some things in him that he
[36:12] wants to show you or who he really
[36:14] is you know we can hear a lot of times
[36:16] of who god is
[36:17] and we can rejoice all those things but
[36:20] you know god wants you to know from a
[36:22] personal standpoint of who he is
[36:24] he wants you to have your own testimony
[36:26] how many believe that tonight
[36:28] he wants you to have your your personal
[36:30] testimony your personal relationship
[36:32] always says that you know it's something
[36:34] about it
[36:35] you know people can talk about how i
[36:37] made it over come on
[36:39] i know you don't want to sit around and
[36:40] just listen to somebody else testimony
[36:42] but you want to have your own testimony
[36:44] you want to let you can let them testify
[36:46] but then you want to tell somebody
[36:47] what god has done for you you know
[36:50] i was sharing with a guy at work and we
[36:52] were sitting in office quite a while the
[36:54] other day
[36:55] and we were just talking you know he was
[36:57] telling me his testimony and i was
[36:59] telling him my testimony
[37:00] and i said you know nevertheless
[37:02] sometimes we count
[37:04] uh people out we just look but you don't
[37:06] know what god done for that person
[37:08] and you don't know sometimes that person
[37:11] that you count now they might have a
[37:12] powerful testimony
[37:14] if you would only sit down and listen
[37:15] sometimes and they can tell you
[37:17] sometimes of what god has done for and
[37:20] even though they might have stumbled off
[37:22] of the path somewhere here and there
[37:24] god could use you as a light that they
[37:26] can look back i remember that
[37:28] you know we were at work once and
[37:30] sitting down at the table and
[37:32] i began to uh talk about i said
[37:34] everybody's uh
[37:36] uh uh i says a lot of people have places
[37:39] where they were in life
[37:40] where they made commitments to god and
[37:43] they said god if you get me out of this
[37:45] place i'll never go back
[37:46] oh god if you do this for me god i serve
[37:49] you all the days of my life
[37:51] i said god brought many that way and you
[37:53] know we begin to tell
[37:55] the testimonies and and uh you know one
[37:58] of the ones
[37:59] the testimonies and i shared again or
[38:01] the older guy that was in vietnam
[38:03] he was saying how you know he was over
[38:06] there and as soon as the gun votes
[38:07] passed by
[38:08] he said that the vietnamese jump out of
[38:11] the weeds and just start shooting at
[38:12] them
[38:13] and he says that they was shooting at
[38:16] him so hard he said they ain't even had
[38:17] time
[38:18] to pick up their guns said he was laying
[38:20] so close to the
[38:21] to the ground he started using his
[38:23] fingernails to dig in the ground to try
[38:24] to get lower
[38:26] he said he can hear people all around
[38:27] him getting chewed up
[38:29] by bullets and he started crying old man
[38:31] started crying he says
[38:33] he started saying to himself he says
[38:35] lord
[38:36] if you get me out of where i'm at right
[38:38] now he said lord i serve you all the
[38:40] days of my life
[38:41] and he said all of a sudden when he said
[38:43] that he said he felt something warm come
[38:45] over him
[38:46] and he says then he got the the strength
[38:49] to get up in the midst of all the
[38:51] bullets flying around him get up
[38:53] and and get his arm bear his arms up and
[38:55] begin to take in the fight back to the
[38:56] enemy he didn't get shot not one time
[38:59] and he says now he says now then i said
[39:03] i told him i said
[39:03] i said i want to call his name but i
[39:05] told him i said you know that commitment
[39:06] you made was real
[39:08] wasn't it that was a real commitment and
[39:10] i says even though
[39:11] god already knew that you wasn't going
[39:13] to hold up to your part god was faithful
[39:15] anyhow
[39:17] and many times god know that you when we
[39:19] make those desperate cries that we ain't
[39:21] gonna hold up to our part
[39:22] but i believe that god knows what was in
[39:24] your heart he know that in your heart if
[39:26] you could
[39:27] live right you would live right he know
[39:29] that in your heart and that's why
[39:31] a lot of times he knows hallelujah that
[39:34] you know when when israel
[39:35] made that statement once they said lord
[39:37] we will keep your jaw we'll keep your
[39:39] statue we'll keep and all this
[39:41] god knew they weren't going to be able
[39:42] to keep it so that's why he knew
[39:44] that what it was going to take for the
[39:46] people to keep his statues
[39:48] was that they was going to have to be
[39:49] born again it was going to be more than
[39:51] just having a letter
[39:54] written in front of them or they can
[39:55] read it every day and
[39:57] even post it on their door post on their
[39:58] bed and all those things but god said
[40:00] i'm gonna have to do something i'm gonna
[40:02] have to write it in their hearts
[40:03] come on i'm gonna have to come down he
[40:05] says i'm gonna have to
[40:07] come down and i'm gonna have to get in
[40:08] them and dwell in them and cause them to
[40:10] walk in my statues
[40:12] and i thank god for that tonight that we
[40:14] don't depend on ourselves to live this
[40:16] life
[40:17] we living this life depending on god to
[40:19] do the work hallelujah
[40:21] for god to keep us when you wake up you
[40:23] just say lord i thank you for keeping me
[40:25] last night
[40:26] and i'm looking for you to keep me
[40:27] tomorrow hallelujah god i'm living this
[40:29] life only because of your grace and your
[40:31] mercy
[40:32] how many believe that tonight so that's
[40:34] what it is
[40:35] we stopped trying on our own but we said
[40:37] lord let your spirit come
[40:39] god let the holy ghost come lord and
[40:41] fill me up hallelujah
[40:43] don't just just don't just give me a
[40:45] touch lord but fill me up
[40:47] let my cup run over hallelujah oh jesus
[40:50] how many believe that tonight aren't you
[40:53] glad that god does those things
[40:56] hallelujah i like how once in the
[40:58] scripture he said the battle ain't yours
[41:00] but it's the lord's we ain't fighting
[41:02] our own battles but we're depending on
[41:04] god tonight how many believe that
[41:06] but we find that i says no matter where
[41:08] god is
[41:09] like we say he got certain things he
[41:11] wants to display but nevertheless
[41:13] you know no matter what form he's in no
[41:16] matter where he comes
[41:17] the dwell is nature going to be the same
[41:19] a lot of times people can say certain
[41:21] things are god but
[41:22] you can look at the nature of it come on
[41:24] you can look at what it what is
[41:26] uh displaying and you can tell that it
[41:28] ain't god
[41:29] come on how because it ain't lining up
[41:32] with the word for one
[41:33] so you can a lot of times tell that and
[41:35] what it is god will never deny himself
[41:37] he'll then he'll never deny the word
[41:39] come on if the word is in you
[41:41] then when the word is going forth you're
[41:43] amen the word
[41:45] you're amen the word why because you
[41:47] just you just agreeing with with the
[41:48] life that's in you
[41:50] though it's cutting you amen and why
[41:52] because
[41:53] when you're hearing the word you see in
[41:55] yourself hallelujah
[41:57] the life that's in you is punctuating
[41:59] the word
[42:00] with an amen how many believe that
[42:02] tonight
[42:03] hallelujah so we find that i say as god
[42:06] in simplicity
[42:07] and the nature of god i says you know
[42:08] one thing about it you know one
[42:10] one of the characteristics of god like
[42:12] it says god has a lot of characteristics
[42:14] but one that we want to talk about
[42:16] tonight is is is
[42:17] the humility part we want to talk about
[42:20] the humility part
[42:21] i says a lot of times you know god
[42:25] you know uh he dwells the prophet god
[42:28] said he dwells in humility
[42:30] god dwells in those things you know
[42:32] seeing here in the scripture
[42:34] how you know david he wanted the bill
[42:37] god house
[42:39] he got up they saying you know he was
[42:41] walking out and he was seeing
[42:43] and you know it was in his heart because
[42:45] he was seeing
[42:46] and looking at how much god has blessed
[42:48] him
[42:49] and nevertheless looking at what all god
[42:52] has blessed him
[42:53] he wanted to do something back for god
[42:56] he wanted it was in his heart
[42:57] god look at how much you bless me and
[42:59] look at where you're living it come on
[43:02] out there intense and yet he said it
[43:04] ain't right hallelujah
[43:06] that i can live in these this big this
[43:08] big uh uh
[43:09] palace and all and the lord dwell in
[43:11] tense it was in his heart to do right
[43:13] no matter how much god blessed him he
[43:16] still and it had in his heart
[43:18] something that he wanted to do for god
[43:20] and i say tonight you know a lot of
[43:22] times
[43:22] we lose that stance when god bless us
[43:25] sometimes
[43:26] we have our hands reaching out for more
[43:28] blessings
[43:29] instead of in our hearts saying lord
[43:31] what can i do to uplift the kingdom of
[43:33] god
[43:34] lord what can i do to be a blessing to
[43:36] your children
[43:37] what can i do to bless you lord
[43:39] hallelujah god you bless
[43:41] me what can i do to return the favor
[43:44] hallelujah how many want to return the
[43:46] favor tonight
[43:47] how many want to give god back to him
[43:49] what he gave to them
[43:50] hallelujah i don't know about you but
[43:53] that's what's in my heart
[43:54] i said his heart was right but many
[43:56] times he says you know
[43:58] i like god's reply to david he says
[44:02] he says i want you to go tell david he
[44:04] says that
[44:05] ever since i brought the children of
[44:07] israel out of egypt he said i dwelt from
[44:10] 10 to 10.
[44:11] he said and not one time did i go to the
[44:14] elders and ask them or to the judges
[44:16] and ask them why haven't you built me a
[44:18] house
[44:19] he said not one time have i asked for
[44:22] that come on
[44:23] but he began to show that you know all
[44:26] these things
[44:27] all those things he was showing
[44:29] something or what
[44:30] of where or where he dwelled in you know
[44:33] i like how in one place
[44:34] he says what house will you build me he
[44:37] said
[44:38] heaven heaven is my throne as the earth
[44:40] is my footstool
[44:41] he says haven't my hands made all these
[44:44] things
[44:44] come on you know i believe that i
[44:46] believe he was solemn and said lord
[44:48] the heavens of heavens can't contain
[44:50] thee let alone this house that we built
[44:53] come on
[44:54] but nevertheless god was showing that it
[44:56] ain't in these
[44:57] carnals these big things that he wants
[44:59] to dwell in but he dwells in humility
[45:01] god don't need all of that sometimes but
[45:03] what god wants
[45:05] is a united vessel god just wants a
[45:07] heart that he can dwell in
[45:09] god wants somebody to say lord here i am
[45:12] god
[45:12] send me god i might not have money and i
[45:15] might not be famous in all the earth
[45:17] i might not be nothing lord but what i
[45:20] got lord here
[45:21] here i am lord use me hallelujah
[45:24] and i like that how god told david you
[45:27] know he says you know
[45:28] he says you know where i brought you
[45:30] from come on i'ma show you what i dwell
[45:32] in
[45:32] come on he said i brought you from the
[45:34] sheep coat from fallen sheep
[45:37] hallelujah on the back side of the
[45:39] wilderness but nevertheless
[45:41] he said i took you from that place
[45:44] and i made you uh again made you uh like
[45:47] the great men in all the earth i gave
[45:49] you a name
[45:50] like the great men and all the earth
[45:52] don't nobody knew you knowed you
[45:54] and i was sharing with the guy at work i
[45:56] said the thing about it is
[45:57] one thing about god i said he loved to
[46:00] take up time
[46:01] with the people that the world rejected
[46:04] he loved to take up time
[46:05] with the ones that strung out on drugs
[46:07] the prostitutes the alcoholist
[46:09] god loves to take up time with those
[46:11] people that the world
[46:13] has rejected hallelujah and he'll raise
[46:15] that person up and give them a name
[46:17] like the great names in all the earth
[46:19] he'll take that person and he'll make
[46:21] something
[46:22] out of nothing hallelujah that's one
[46:24] thing to do
[46:25] how many believe that tonight so what it
[46:28] does
[46:29] it makes you start looking back over
[46:31] your life come on
[46:33] it makes you start considering like that
[46:35] says when i consider the heavens the
[46:37] work of thy hands what is a man
[46:39] that thou art mine for him it might make
[46:41] you start looking
[46:42] back the way god brought you from make
[46:44] you start thinking about
[46:46] some of your low points in life and it
[46:48] make you
[46:49] sometimes get tears in your eyes and
[46:52] think about that god
[46:53] bypass some of all the ones that was way
[46:56] better than you come on
[46:57] some that was counted hallelujah
[47:00] some that might have had a better resume
[47:02] than you god bypassed all of them
[47:04] hallelujah
[47:05] and he took you and he gave you a name
[47:08] hallelujah
[47:11] how many thank god for that tonight i
[47:13] said sometimes
[47:15] uh uh you know i was out praying the
[47:17] other day and and the song came to me i
[47:19] was sharing with them
[47:20] i said the song came to me what more can
[47:23] he do come on
[47:24] he don't lay the foundation he don't
[47:27] open up the way
[47:28] what more are you looking for him to do
[47:30] come on god down laid the foundation
[47:33] he don't open the way up he doesn't told
[47:36] you i'll be with you even in you
[47:38] hallelujah
[47:39] until the end of all time didn't he tell
[47:41] you that hallelujah
[47:42] he said i'll never leave you hallelujah
[47:45] nor forsake you
[47:46] i like how he told joshua neither will i
[47:48] fail you hallelujah
[47:50] i don't care how where you at tonight
[47:52] god ain't a failure
[47:53] i don't care where you find yourself in
[47:55] the condition you find your life in
[47:57] god is not a failure hallelujah in the
[48:00] midst of your condition
[48:01] god is still triumphant god is still
[48:04] victorious in the midst of the muck in
[48:06] the mary clay hallelujah
[48:08] oh jesus they're literally gonna find a
[48:10] way to push its way out of the mud
[48:12] hallelujah and sprout i was sharing that
[48:15] that's why i was kind of stirred i was
[48:16] sharing that
[48:17] with the guy at work i said something
[48:19] about you don't know
[48:20] the potential that's in those seeds
[48:22] hallelujah
[48:24] i said but god has the ability to see
[48:26] the potential in it
[48:28] it might just look like a little seed
[48:29] but god see trees coming forth
[48:32] god see fruit thousands and abundance of
[48:35] fruit
[48:35] coming forth out of that little seed i
[48:37] said what it is
[48:38] you got to get it in the right
[48:40] atmosphere you got to get it in the
[48:42] right atmosphere where it can get the
[48:44] right nutrients
[48:45] i don't know about you but i said those
[48:47] little ones sometimes that we just think
[48:49] ain't nothing
[48:50] i said but nevertheless get them in the
[48:52] right atmosphere get them in the
[48:53] atmosphere where the holy ghost is
[48:55] falling
[48:55] where the power of god is coming down
[48:57] and watch the life that comes out of it
[49:00] watch the the fruits that come out of
[49:02] that life hallelujah
[49:04] oh jesus you didn't see it but god saw
[49:07] it
[49:08] hallelujah you didn't see the fruits
[49:11] coming out of your life but god saw it
[49:13] hallelujah and he said i'ma work with it
[49:16] i know what to give it i know how much
[49:18] sunlight it needs
[49:20] i know how much water it need and rain i
[49:22] know what it takes
[49:23] hallelujah to bring out your life the
[49:25] best in you i know what it takes to
[49:27] bring out your life what i can get glory
[49:30] out of hallelujah
[49:31] oh jesus it says the nature of god
[49:35] god dwells and you know just for the
[49:37] sake of time i had to skip i said god
[49:40] one of his characteristics was humility
[49:42] god dwells in those things come on
[49:44] how many believe that tonight it's in
[49:46] humility you know
[49:47] when you think about uh i says that he
[49:50] was clothed in humility you know
[49:52] when you're looking at humility you're
[49:54] talking about to recognize your statue
[49:56] to be little or or of no importance
[50:00] when relation to deity when you look at
[50:04] your statue
[50:05] and you look at who you are and you
[50:07] count yourself as little of no
[50:09] importance in relation to guilty even
[50:11] jesus
[50:12] when he walked the shores he walked the
[50:15] earth he says i can
[50:16] he never bragged on himself he said but
[50:18] i can only do what the father is showing
[50:19] me
[50:20] he says i'm written it's written of me
[50:22] to do thy will come on
[50:23] he said there's none good no not one but
[50:25] god he was always
[50:27] pointing back to god and who he was
[50:29] always pointing back to the father
[50:32] always pointing back to those things not
[50:34] recognizing himself to do nothing
[50:36] but only what he allows that's what i'm
[50:38] capable of
[50:39] and so if the holy spirit is dwelling in
[50:42] you what would it do it would point
[50:44] people back to the father
[50:45] it would give all the glory to god it
[50:47] would always recognize that god it ain't
[50:49] what i can do
[50:50] lord is but it's what you're capable of
[50:53] i ain't worthy know how
[50:54] god but you're worthy you get all the
[50:56] glory out of my life
[50:58] you'll get what you want out of my life
[50:59] lord here it is i give it all to you
[51:01] lord hallelujah
[51:03] how many want to give it all to him
[51:04] tonight pointing
[51:06] people back to the father pointing
[51:09] people to where your help come from
[51:11] i believe david said i know where my
[51:13] help come from come on
[51:14] my help coming from where the lord which
[51:17] made heaven and earth hallelujah
[51:19] oh jesus i said pointing people back to
[51:22] where your help come from
[51:24] your testimony ought to point people
[51:26] back to jesus your life
[51:27] ought to point people back to jesus
[51:29] hallelujah what you displayed out to
[51:32] point people back to jesus
[51:33] and up that lonely road of calvary
[51:37] you know i was saying the other day i
[51:39] said
[51:40] you know it came to my heart i said you
[51:42] know
[51:43] sometimes sometimes
[51:46] people can look at you in your situation
[51:50] and they can say oh they know what
[51:52] you're going through or they
[51:54] or they know what you're dealing with
[51:55] come on but in all reality they don't
[51:58] have a clue
[51:59] come on they don't know the pain that
[52:03] you feel
[52:04] they don't know the hurt you're going
[52:06] through they don't know those lonely
[52:08] nuts
[52:09] that you face with but i says
[52:13] even though you seem like sometimes
[52:16] it seems like nobody knows i said one
[52:19] thing about it
[52:21] he promised i'll never leave you when
[52:23] you think that road is lonely
[52:26] god is there all the time how do you
[52:28] think you keep pressing your way through
[52:30] how you think you keep pushing it
[52:33] fighting another day
[52:34] it ain't by your strength but it's by
[52:36] the strength of the holy ghost
[52:38] it's god teaching you that i want you to
[52:42] lean on me
[52:43] quit trying on your own and give it over
[52:45] to me
[52:46] hallelujah in weakness i'ma
[52:50] show you what real strength is in
[52:53] humility i'm gonna show you
[52:54] what i can do what i dwell in you know i
[52:57] think about
[52:58] moses and how i like how moses
[53:02] he told them he said lord who am i
[53:06] that you should send me come on many
[53:09] people want to go
[53:10] but he said lord who am i hallelujah
[53:13] 80 years old wheat in the flesh
[53:16] come on but nevertheless that's what god
[53:20] dwelt then
[53:21] god said you go down but i'm coming down
[53:24] i'm the one coming down to deliver them
[53:26] i'ma show you hallelujah that in
[53:28] weakness
[53:29] where your strength is gonna come from
[53:32] hallelujah how many believe that tonight
[53:35] but we find that i said god you know
[53:37] that's what it is
[53:39] it's hard sometimes for us to
[53:42] recognize or to or to uh display
[53:46] as being a human that humility that
[53:48] god's looking for now we're not
[53:49] saying to conjure up your own humility
[53:52] because god don't dwell on those things
[53:54] come on
[53:54] like he talked about the pharisees and
[53:56] how when they fast they walk around with
[53:58] sad conscience and all these things
[54:00] to to show off before men come on he
[54:02] says but they have their reward we're
[54:04] not talking about these things come on
[54:06] but god is something about his spirit
[54:09] brings about
[54:10] i believe a presence it brings about you
[54:14] know
[54:14] a nature that comes in and you can't
[54:17] help it but that's what you walk in
[54:19] hallelujah that's the life that's being
[54:21] produced out of you
[54:23] come on we talk about like we said those
[54:25] trees those trees
[54:26] only produce the life that's in it come
[54:29] on
[54:29] the branch is only going to produce the
[54:31] life that's in the vine
[54:33] we know they talk about how they drafted
[54:35] branches and all these things
[54:36] but we know that if that vine would ever
[54:38] put forth another branch
[54:40] it'll produce the life that's in the
[54:42] vine hallelujah
[54:44] and when we look at our lives i said
[54:46] lord the life
[54:47] that's being produced i want it to be
[54:50] your life
[54:51] the life that's being produced aside
[54:54] from the signs and wonders come on but a
[54:56] man a loneliness of heart come on
[54:58] a man that can only do what but give god
[55:01] the glory how many feel like that
[55:03] tonight
[55:03] come on and what it is i said but it's
[55:06] hard sometimes
[55:08] you know it's hard sometimes for a man
[55:10] to
[55:11] to like i said to recognize himself of
[55:14] little or no importance
[55:15] come on it's hard for a man to do that
[55:18] it's hard especially for men like you
[55:20] say to do that to recognize themselves
[55:23] of little oh no importance you know when
[55:26] israel was crying out
[55:27] for a king their whole objective their
[55:30] hole in their mind
[55:31] you know even though god was leading
[55:33] them god was fighting all their battles
[55:34] and god was was blessing them
[55:36] but their whole objective of why they
[55:39] wanted a king
[55:40] you know the bible says they wanted to
[55:42] be like the other nations
[55:44] they wanted to have a man that they can
[55:46] put out in the front and show him off
[55:49] come on and say this is our man this
[55:52] is who fighting all our battles they
[55:54] made they made that statement
[55:55] that he can go out and fight our battles
[55:57] come on
[55:58] to be out in the forefront and all those
[56:00] things and god allowed him to do that
[56:02] but you see what happened when that man
[56:05] he was so caught up in himself
[56:07] that he felt like he can do what he
[56:09] wanted with the word of god
[56:10] he felt like he didn't he can take what
[56:13] he wanted do what he want hallelujah
[56:15] well god
[56:16] rejected him in the end didn't he
[56:19] and i say that even today you know we
[56:22] watch
[56:23] our attitudes we watch the spirit that's
[56:26] on us
[56:26] because one thing about it you can be
[56:28] rejected by men but you don't want to be
[56:30] rejected by god
[56:31] in the end you don't want him to say
[56:34] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[56:36] i'd rather be rejected by my family
[56:39] rejected by my friends
[56:41] and in the end have him say well done
[56:43] thy good and faithful servant
[56:45] enter into the joys of the lord
[56:47] hallelujah you walk that lonely walk
[56:49] you walk that that walk that was lonely
[56:52] hallelujah
[56:53] men in this theme you're great nobody
[56:55] sometimes even recognize you
[56:57] but nevertheless you were willing to
[56:59] walk that walk how many
[57:00] are willing to walk that walk tonight i
[57:02] said god
[57:03] you know what it is that says he doesn't
[57:05] need a man
[57:07] that's head and shoulders but what he
[57:09] needed what he needs
[57:10] is a yielded vessel come on a yielded
[57:14] vessel
[57:15] i asked the question are you willing
[57:17] tonight to be that yielded vessel
[57:19] are you willing that night i mean
[57:21] tonight to take the back seat sometime
[57:24] come on are you willing to get down to
[57:27] your knees and pray
[57:29] when nobody else is sin are you willing
[57:31] to go the distance hallelujah
[57:33] that's what god dwells in you know i
[57:36] have some things i want to share but
[57:38] for the sake of time we won't be able to
[57:40] share them but i said there's one thing
[57:41] about it
[57:42] you know god dwells in humility he
[57:44] dwells and that's those things the
[57:45] humbleness of heart
[57:46] sometimes we got to watch our speech you
[57:49] know i want to go to some things
[57:50] we got to watch our speech you know your
[57:53] speech and the things you say can take
[57:54] the presence of god out your life
[57:57] can rob the presence of god from you the
[58:00] things
[58:01] you know of god could have poured out
[58:02] more things but he didn't
[58:04] why because your speech destroyed your
[58:06] speech killed it come on
[58:08] all right they say your speech betrayed
[58:09] you but god is good
[58:12] god watches over tonight amen
[58:28] praise the lord amen
[58:32] we appreciate the word tonight amen
[58:35] god is good amen and he watches over us
[58:39] amen
[58:41] i was i had wrote down
[58:44] at the beginning of his message rejected
[58:48] and how do we deal with rejection
[58:51] and so i i told caleb i just
[58:55] showed him and brother ernest at the end
[58:58] of his message he started talking about
[59:00] re
[59:00] reject rejection and
[59:04] i was saying how do we deal with
[59:06] rejection
[59:08] the bible said he was despised and
[59:10] rejected a men
[59:13] a man of sorrow and acquainted with
[59:14] greed
[59:17] you know many times
[59:21] those that are godly
[59:25] they are the oddballs they are the
[59:27] rejected of this society
[59:30] if you want men
[59:34] to receive you i was just studying
[59:37] the great men of the old of the gospel
[59:40] and
[59:41] like mueller and um sturgeon and
[59:44] different ones
[59:46] and those they can grow
[59:50] to thousands thousands coming
[59:53] to to their ministry then they
[59:57] face the time of rejection if you're
[59:59] going to stand
[1:00:01] you're really going to stand for the
[1:00:02] word if you're really going to stand
[1:00:04] strong for the word
[1:00:06] then they had to deal with rejection
[1:00:10] people began to the
[1:00:13] newspapers and everything began to talk
[1:00:16] about them
[1:00:17] criticize them it was hard
[1:00:20] difficult in their lives to deal with
[1:00:23] rejection
[1:00:25] and sometimes
[1:00:28] sometimes you can go into some dark
[1:00:30] places when we're being rejected
[1:00:33] almost into depression when we're
[1:00:37] rejected
[1:00:38] when you're talked about so i looked at
[1:00:42] those men and i said
[1:00:45] those that live godly in christ jesus
[1:00:48] every one of us we have to face
[1:00:52] and know how to deal with rejection
[1:00:54] because
[1:00:55] that's what we should come to know
[1:00:59] what it feels like to be rejected
[1:01:00] because our
[1:01:02] captain of our salvation
[1:01:06] jesus dealt with rejection
[1:01:10] david though he was one that was hailed
[1:01:13] you know david has killed his ten
[1:01:16] thousands and so forth
[1:01:18] and everybody looked up to david david
[1:01:20] david
[1:01:21] one day he had to deal with absalom and
[1:01:23] being rejected
[1:01:25] brother and sister if we going to get
[1:01:29] anywhere in christ if
[1:01:31] though christ blessed us exceedingly and
[1:01:33] abundantly
[1:01:35] with all his blessings then there come a
[1:01:37] time when god
[1:01:39] event you're gonna feel what it felt
[1:01:42] like
[1:01:43] to be rejected no matter how you try to
[1:01:47] stand for god
[1:01:50] there's to be an enemy that's going to
[1:01:52] take you through your time of rejection
[1:01:55] the time when you'll be despised
[1:01:59] and when you deal with it properly
[1:02:03] god will restore you after all your
[1:02:05] rejection
[1:02:07] god would bring you amen back to the
[1:02:10] throne
[1:02:11] as he did david and those men that
[1:02:15] had to go through their time of
[1:02:17] rejection ridicule
[1:02:19] persecution but they spilled on the word
[1:02:23] and if you we're expected to stand on
[1:02:25] the word
[1:02:27] then we're gonna have to know that we're
[1:02:28] gonna be rejected
[1:02:31] and people gonna look at you as being
[1:02:33] odd and different
[1:02:35] they want you to give in to the world
[1:02:37] the world is giving in
[1:02:39] in the religious world amen even
[1:02:42] you know you might say message believers
[1:02:44] or whatever
[1:02:45] they're giving in
[1:02:49] if you don't come and follow the crowd
[1:02:52] then you're going to deal with rejection
[1:02:56] sturgeon he had to deal with the
[1:02:57] baptists or whatever
[1:02:59] because he's still true to the word and
[1:03:01] neighborhood become loose and liberal
[1:03:04] but he stood strong with the word so
[1:03:06] yeah
[1:03:07] he had to leave he had to get out of it
[1:03:11] and i'm saying brother and sister
[1:03:13] sometimes when you're dealing with
[1:03:15] rejection
[1:03:16] amen but he held to that word
[1:03:19] he held to that word he held to his
[1:03:22] conviction and he held truth
[1:03:24] didn't worry about all the popularity
[1:03:28] didn't give in brother and sister
[1:03:31] that's what we got to do others might
[1:03:34] want to get
[1:03:35] loose and get free and don't stand on
[1:03:38] the word no more
[1:03:39] you got to hold to the word you got to
[1:03:42] hold true to god's word
[1:03:46] are you with me thank god for brother
[1:03:49] ernest thank god for the word today
[1:03:53] amen remember
[1:03:57] your commitment is not to man your
[1:03:59] commitment is to christ
[1:04:02] you love him amen and stay committed to
[1:04:05] god
[1:04:06] and to his word amen god bless you let
[1:04:09] us there
[1:04:18] father in jesus name
[1:04:23] lord you said all the live godly in
[1:04:26] christ jesus yourself for persecution
[1:04:30] father help this little body of
[1:04:33] believers
[1:04:35] those oh god recognize the real
[1:04:39] time of rejection
[1:04:44] we won't be popular
[1:04:48] we won't be men pleasers so the crowd
[1:04:52] would not
[1:04:53] but it's going to be a straight as your
[1:04:56] servant said today it's a straight and
[1:04:58] narrow way
[1:05:04] it's straight and narrow it won't be the
[1:05:06] broad way
[1:05:08] but it's straight and narrow
[1:05:13] lord you're saying again at the straight
[1:05:15] gate
[1:05:17] father help us to enter in at the
[1:05:19] straight gate
[1:05:23] father is the lonely way
[1:05:28] but must jesus bear the cross alone
[1:05:32] and all the world go free
[1:05:35] certainly there's a cross for everyone
[1:05:37] and there's a cross for me
[1:05:40] lord help us to carry this cross
