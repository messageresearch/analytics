[34:27] Leviticus chapter
[34:43] 6 Leviticus chapter 6 and we'll start in
[34:47] verse I think they got it right verse
[34:50] eight and the Lord spake unto Moses
[34:53] saying command Aaron and his son saying
[34:56] this is the law of the burnt offering it
[34:59] is the burnt offering because of the
[35:01] burning upon the altar all night until
[35:04] the morning and the fire of the altar
[35:06] shall be burning in
[35:09] it and the priest shall put on his linen
[35:12] garment and his linen breaches shall he
[35:15] put upon his flesh and take up the ashes
[35:18] which the fire hath consumed with the
[35:20] burnt offering on the Altar and he shall
[35:23] put them beside the Altar and he shall
[35:26] put off his garments and put on other
[35:29] garments and carry forth the ashes
[35:31] without the camp unto a clean place and
[35:34] the fire upon the altar shall be burning
[35:36] in it and it shall not be put out and
[35:40] the priest shall burn the wood on it
[35:43] every morning and lay the burnt offering
[35:45] in order upon it and it shall burn
[35:48] thereon the fat of the peace offerings
[35:51] the fire shall ever be burning upon the
[35:54] Altar and it shall never go out amen God
[35:58] bless you reading of this word you may
[35:59] be
[36:04] seated amen tonight I'd like to speak on
[36:06] a little topic that I entitled don't let
[36:09] your fire go out amen don't let your
[36:12] fire go out and you see here in the in
[36:14] the scripture you see that he commanded
[36:16] them in verse 13 and said the fire shall
[36:20] ever be burned upon the Altar and it
[36:23] shall never go out and I started
[36:25] thinking about a fire and how you go
[36:27] about building this fire and I and I
[36:30] thought about I
[36:32] said wrote something I said sometimes
[36:35] you can use the wrong fuel for your fire
[36:38] bless sometimes you can use the wrong
[36:40] fuel for your fire and when you use the
[36:42] wrong fuel it causes things to happen to
[36:45] your fire it causes things to happen to
[36:48] your fire if you go take some wet wood
[36:50] and put it on a fire Your Fire won't
[36:53] burn the same amen if you go to take
[36:55] some green wood that ain't dried out and
[36:57] you put it on your fire it won't burn
[36:59] the same so what are you using to build
[37:02] your fire what are you using to build
[37:05] your fire and I encourage you to not let
[37:07] your fire go out he said that's what
[37:10] they can they they com they the Lord
[37:13] commanded them to never let the fire go
[37:15] out so is your fire
[37:18] diming see when your fire starts to dim
[37:21] you can't see as well as you used to you
[37:24] can't you're not warm as well as you
[37:26] might have been when it was cold because
[37:27] your fire is dying out you're not the
[37:30] things that's keeping you from from from
[37:33] seeing what you need to see is no longer
[37:35] there cuz your fire is dying out the
[37:38] things that you that that wasn't
[37:41] attacking you before can come closer
[37:43] because your fire was is dying out the
[37:46] animals that was in the woods when you
[37:47] don't have a fire they can come right up
[37:49] to you and they may be there to harm you
[37:52] but when you got a big fire they not
[37:54] coming near because the fire is there
[37:56] the Bible says let your light so shine
[37:59] see when you got that light shining
[38:02] others ain't coming near because it
[38:03] might expose them but if you ain't got
[38:06] no light they can come right up next to
[38:08] you they can come right up next to you
[38:10] cuz they feel comfortable being next to
[38:13] you cuz there's nothing to deter them
[38:15] from being next to you cuz you don't
[38:17] have no light you don't have no fire
[38:20] that if they get close they going to get
[38:21] burned if they get close they going to
[38:23] realize it's not you but it's something
[38:25] that's greater than you it's something
[38:27] that's greater that than you that's
[38:29] standing next to you see that's what
[38:31] fire does it it illuminates you that's
[38:34] what fire does it keeps you it keeps you
[38:37] warn there's a presence when fire is
[38:39] there there's a presence when fire when
[38:41] you are near fire you can tell you can
[38:44] tell when you near fire you might say
[38:47] you know what I'm going to play with the
[38:48] fire I was telling someone I said you
[38:51] know what sometimes it may not be you
[38:53] playing with fire but it might be
[38:54] someone else would you stand next to
[38:57] someone that was playing with
[38:59] fire would you stand next to someone
[39:02] that was playing with
[39:05] fire but sometimes you do it every
[39:07] single day amen cuz you say that's my
[39:10] friend but you know that they playing
[39:12] with fire you might not be but you but
[39:16] you know that they are but you stand
[39:18] right next to
[39:19] them and sometimes and God sometimes he
[39:23] has to show you that listen where they
[39:25] going you don't want to go that's right
[39:27] you can have the fire in you or you can
[39:29] face it one
[39:30] day see which fire do you want cuz the
[39:33] fire that's in you can take you to a
[39:34] whole another place but when you got to
[39:37] face that fire there ain't no escaping
[39:38] it one way or another you going to touch
[39:41] fire one way or another and there's no
[39:44] escaping the fire that's coming the
[39:46] wrath of God that's coming and he said
[39:48] that you can go up or you can go down
[39:50] but one one of the ways you going to
[39:52] have to get some fire cuz fire is there
[39:54] to cleanse you the fire does nothing but
[39:57] cleanse you when they light when a wi
[39:59] fire comes it destroys everything it
[40:02] destroys everything that's in his path
[40:04] everything that's not rock or concrete
[40:07] and that's solid it destroys it and
[40:10] there ain't nothing that you can do
[40:11] about it when the Fire gets hot enough
[40:13] it'll destroy
[40:14] that see sometimes is your fire hot
[40:18] enough is your fire big enough that it
[40:21] can scare away the devil when he comes
[40:23] near if you just got a Candlestick that
[40:26] ain't scaring nobody
[40:28] sometimes you got to build a big fire
[40:30] but but but what are you building your
[40:32] fire work with sometimes your actions
[40:35] speak louder than your words that's
[40:37] right you got big words but you ain't
[40:40] got no actions behind them you say a lot
[40:42] and you say I believe this and that but
[40:44] you ain't got no actions behind them and
[40:47] the devil just sitting there watching
[40:48] you he said I hear you but he didn't
[40:51] move cuz there was no actions that you
[40:53] put behind the words that you spoke I
[40:56] said you might have been praying I said
[40:58] you might not have been praying like you
[41:00] used
[41:01] to see when the fire start dimming you
[41:04] got to ask the question what's wrong
[41:06] when the fire start dying you got to ask
[41:08] the question what's wrong in my
[41:11] life because when when you in tune with
[41:14] God your fire is bright and it's burning
[41:16] and you ain't got to tell other people
[41:18] that God is with me cuz he's right there
[41:20] with you and people know when they look
[41:22] at you they say yeah they know the Lord
[41:25] they ain't coming to you to talk about
[41:26] gossip they coming to ask for
[41:28] prayer so when the conversation changed
[41:31] what changed with you
[41:34] uhhuh cuz the person that came to ask
[41:36] for prayer is not talking about
[41:37] everybody which you something had to
[41:40] change something had to change was it
[41:43] because your fire got dim on was it
[41:47] because your light just got a D I didn't
[41:48] say it was gone but every now and again
[41:51] when you got a fire that's them you got
[41:53] to go poke the fire you got to go poke
[41:55] the fire and then you got to put a new
[41:57] log on it and you got to get that fire
[41:59] to burn it again so you can feel it
[42:01] again so that heat will come I said you
[42:04] might not have been fasting or reading
[42:06] your Bible as in times past see there's
[42:09] things that can help your fire build
[42:11] there's things that you can do to help
[42:13] your fire grow there's things that that
[42:15] you can take place where you know that
[42:17] that that those meetings and those times
[42:19] with God they real and you can see that
[42:22] fire burn you can see the effects of the
[42:24] fire say what is your fire affec
[42:28] cuz when fire is there it has an effect
[42:31] I don't care whe whether it's a small
[42:33] one or a big one you touch it it's going
[42:35] to have an effect if you get close to it
[42:38] it's going to have an
[42:40] effect I said and the small things that
[42:44] didn't bother you as much bother you
[42:46] more now when your fire get them those
[42:49] little small things that you thought
[42:51] that was over they come and they start
[42:53] bothering you that's right cuz that fire
[42:55] is no longer there to protect prot you
[42:58] that fire is no longer there to protect
[43:00] you and even when you getting close if
[43:02] the fire is small it's not doing the
[43:04] same thing so when you got a big fire
[43:06] you can stand way away from it and feel
[43:09] the
[43:10] heat if you ever l a grill and use the
[43:13] wrong um use the wrong thing when it
[43:17] when you light it and it jump off you
[43:19] jump back right why cuz that heat is
[43:22] intense I've done it before so yeah but
[43:25] the heat is intense
[43:28] and when the heat is intense you ain't
[43:29] got to be close to it to feel the
[43:31] fire but when it's a little small fire
[43:34] you got to stand right next to it and
[43:36] you got to hover over it and hopefully
[43:39] you feel something but then in that
[43:41] moment that's time to feed it cuz you
[43:44] never want the fire to
[43:46] die because it's hard starting a cold
[43:48] fire oh yes it's hard starting a cold
[43:52] fire when you don't have the ingredients
[43:54] that you need to start that fire it's
[43:57] another thing to feed the fire even if
[43:59] the fire Get Low I can feed it and I
[44:01] know it to jump back up I can feed the
[44:03] fire but when the fire
[44:07] die it's hard to start that
[44:09] fire it's hard to start a cold fire cuz
[44:14] you got to go against the elements you
[44:16] got to go against everything that is
[44:18] against you to light that fire again and
[44:21] to light that fire again I guarantee you
[44:24] once you get it lit you don't want it to
[44:25] go back out
[44:28] that that once you get that fire lit you
[44:30] don't want it to go back out because it
[44:32] took you too much to overcome to get
[44:34] that fire
[44:36] lit but if you got fire inside of you
[44:39] you got to feed that fire so that it
[44:41] won't die so that you won't have to go
[44:43] through the struggles and the battles to
[44:45] get that fire relit in your life if
[44:48] you're waning in your faith this is the
[44:49] time to pick it up and say Lord I Need
[44:52] My Fire to be rekindled I need you to
[44:54] put some accelerant on this fire amen so
[44:57] that I can feed this fire and this fire
[44:59] can continue to grow it's not a time to
[45:02] stop and slow down it's a time to build
[45:04] the fire cuz the bigger your fire
[45:06] eventually when I come into the house of
[45:08] the Lord with my fire and you got your
[45:10] fire eventually we can have a big old
[45:12] fire and the devil can't stand in the
[45:14] way of
[45:17] it but if you ain't got no fire now I
[45:20] got to try to light your fire with
[45:23] mine and you wonder why sometime the
[45:26] song leader struggle
[45:27] the Breer struggle is because you ain't
[45:30] have no
[45:31] fire thank you Jesus but when your fire
[45:34] is there and you walk in with your fire
[45:39] it's a whole totally different
[45:41] atmosphere cuz it doesn't matter what
[45:43] the preacher say don't matter what the
[45:45] song Leaders sing you going to enter
[45:46] into worship and say Lord I Thank you
[45:49] for lighting My Fire Lord I Thank you
[45:51] for building my fire and keeping me in
[45:54] tune with the fire that you gave me this
[45:55] week amen
[45:57] see God has a way to continue to build
[46:00] your fire he has a way of continue to
[46:02] make sure that your fire is growing amen
[46:05] amen but you have the authority and the
[46:08] power sometime to figure out whether you
[46:10] want your fire to die or
[46:13] not cuz you can stop your fire from
[46:18] growing sometimes you can go over there
[46:20] and say Lord I don't want you to
[46:21] illuminate this I throw some water on
[46:24] it Lord I don't want you to touch tou
[46:27] this I'm going to throw some water
[46:29] on say God don't leave you but you can
[46:32] leave him amen and sometimes it's real
[46:35] strategic when you leave
[46:37] them Lord cuz you afraid of what God is
[46:40] about to do bless you afraid of what God
[46:44] is about to show you you afraid cuz you
[46:47] know it's right around the
[46:49] corner you know what's around the corner
[46:52] sometimes nobody else knows what you
[46:55] know and if God to build that fire
[46:58] either something going to happen or you
[46:59] going to have to do something that you
[47:00] don't want to
[47:04] do Lord so you will throw some water on
[47:07] that
[47:08] fire and think that God ain't see
[47:13] you wonder wonder why it's starting to
[47:15] get cold and people asking you why is it
[47:18] getting cold cuz they can see it that
[47:21] fire ain't the
[47:22] same that fire ain't as bright as it
[47:25] used to be and they can see that that's
[47:28] right and they coming to ask you what's
[47:29] wrong you say everything
[47:33] okay but God sees it amen he saw what
[47:37] you
[47:38] did Jesus but you had the ability to say
[47:42] Lord forgive me Lord I want you to
[47:45] rekindle and grow my fire
[47:48] again and it's not too late he gives us
[47:51] each an opportunity yes he does said as
[47:54] much sometimes you got to go to the Lord
[47:55] and say Lord I'm sorry and thank you for
[47:58] your grace and mercy
[48:00] am am you're rich in grace and
[48:03] mercy prophet of God said he said when
[48:07] you let the fire go out we're
[48:11] sinking I wonder did Peter's fire go out
[48:14] when he was walking on the sea he
[48:16] started to look at all the storms and
[48:19] all this and he started
[48:22] sinking said when when you let the fire
[48:25] go out we start
[48:27] sinking he said and sometimes you go and
[48:31] you think that the painted fire is good
[48:34] enough for
[48:35] me I can see it I imagine I'm feeling
[48:39] heat but you're slowly
[48:42] dying you're slowly dying cuz you're
[48:44] only looking at a picture you're only
[48:46] looking at something that used to be but
[48:49] ain't present you're only looking at
[48:51] something that that happened but not
[48:53] what's happening now cuz you you looking
[48:56] at that but you ain't realizing that
[48:58] your fire is gone cuz it's a beautiful
[49:02] picture what happened was a beautiful
[49:04] thing and you can look at it but there's
[49:07] no Warth coming from it he said how can
[49:10] a freezing man get warn by a painted
[49:12] fire how can a starving man eat from a
[49:16] painted picture of
[49:17] food if God is not a man who will enti
[49:21] and tantalized with some painted picture
[49:24] what what the Holy Ghost was then what
[49:27] Jesus Christ was then he is now that's
[49:30] true that's what he say just the same as
[49:32] he was then the same yesterday today and
[49:35] forever certainly we just need the
[49:39] fire let the fire goes out in your
[49:42] church brother and the church is gone
[49:45] that's right when your fire go dies part
[49:49] of the church
[49:51] dies but you don't look at it in the
[49:53] whole thing you just saying I just want
[49:54] to do what I want to do but it has an
[49:58] effect and when you cold sometimes I'm
[50:01] taking my branches to light you
[50:03] eventually I run out of
[50:06] branches because I'm I'm over here
[50:08] trying to light your fire amen trying to
[50:11] make sure that you all right trying to
[50:12] make sure that you okay but I'm I'm over
[50:15] here carrying things that ain't even
[50:19] mine but how does your fire look see at
[50:23] a certain point in time you got to come
[50:25] and say it's on you not on me it's on
[50:28] you it's not on me while your fire ain't
[50:31] out it's on you and not on me and when
[50:35] you realize that you say Lord I I hey I
[50:37] can't worry about your fire going out
[50:39] cuz mine going out that's right mine
[50:42] going out lord it's so cold in here that
[50:45] mine's going out Lord I need you to
[50:46] Light My Fire some more Lord I need you
[50:49] to rekindle My Fire Lord I need that
[50:52] explosion of the holy ghost in my life
[50:54] that that that fire can continue to go
[50:56] and
[50:59] burn sometimes you got to get to that
[51:02] point Lord I got to leave you alone and
[51:04] go by myself until until that fire can
[51:07] grow and grow and grow until I a I just
[51:09] got to walk near you walk in the other
[51:11] direction cuz you feel the heat I ain't
[51:14] even got to be near you but you feel the
[51:18] heat see that's the type of fire that
[51:20] you want where the devil see you coming
[51:22] and say I got to
[51:24] go the devil see you coming say uhuh I
[51:27] ain't getting burned
[51:29] today but if your fire ain't there he'll
[51:32] be right there next with you
[51:33] conversating with you having a wonderful
[51:35] time laughing and joking and say hey
[51:37] that's my best
[51:39] friend if your best friend is the
[51:41] biggest devil you know you got a problem
[51:44] sir you got a problem if you said that
[51:47] person had a problem and now they your
[51:49] best friend
[51:51] I and you know the Lord ain't
[51:54] delivering Then I then I'm wondering
[51:56] what's wrong with you that's all right
[51:58] cuz the fire must have die the fire had
[52:01] to dim down for them to be comfortable
[52:03] around
[52:04] you but don't let your fire go out cuz
[52:08] when you let it go out the devil can get
[52:09] near you the things that you struggle
[52:11] with used to they can come back and get
[52:14] closer to you that's right that don't
[52:16] mean you going to fall but they'll get
[52:18] closer to you and when you see that come
[52:20] and you say I got to reexamine my fire I
[52:23] got to reexamine my fire I got to re
[52:26] examine and see where I am with my fire
[52:29] got to stop looking at this one and that
[52:31] one because I'm looking at them but I
[52:32] ain't paying attention to my fire I'm
[52:35] paying attention to theirs and paying
[52:36] attention to this one and that but my
[52:38] fire is dying amen say I got I can't let
[52:43] my fire die I can't let the things that
[52:46] God gave me see the trick is the thing
[52:48] is you didn't like this Fire come on bro
[52:52] if you had lit the fire see in the Bible
[52:54] here they said that they didn't like
[52:56] this fire he said don't let it die
[52:58] that's right it didn't say that they lit
[53:00] the fire he said Don't Let the Fire Die
[53:02] they was there to maintain that fire
[53:05] they was there to make sure that fire
[53:06] every single day they put wood on the
[53:08] fire and they took out the ashes that
[53:10] mean that something died if you got
[53:13] ashes something had had to be
[53:15] disintegrated the fire did something
[53:16] they removed the Ashes to make sure the
[53:18] fire had oxygen made sure that fire
[53:21] could breathe when was the last time you
[53:23] let go of all your dirt and let the Lord
[53:25] have it
[53:28] when was the last time you took out all
[53:30] the dirt and gave it to the Lord and
[53:32] that was it so your fire could
[53:35] breathe your fire can't breathe if it
[53:37] don't have
[53:39] oxygen but when was the last time you
[53:41] did that and said Lord I give you
[53:43] everything and I Surrender everything
[53:45] and gave it to him so that your fire
[53:47] could
[53:50] breathe when was the last time you
[53:52] picked up your Bible to feed the feed
[53:54] the fire that's right amen
[53:57] Hallelujah see that's what it takes for
[53:58] your fire to be maintained when was the
[54:01] last time you had a conversation with
[54:03] god not went down to asking for stuff
[54:07] but had a conversation with god well you
[54:10] talk to God and he talked back to
[54:13] youen see when you got that fire going
[54:16] that's what happens God will show you
[54:18] stuff before before it come to past you
[54:22] will see things and you will wonder why
[54:24] you know certain things was nothing but
[54:27] God told
[54:28] you but when your fire is burning and
[54:31] it's and it's there you can feel that
[54:33] and you know that God is with me so when
[54:36] that this fire was there they knew they
[54:38] knew that God was there and Samuel they
[54:41] said the lamp it went out and that's
[54:44] when God brought judgment my
[54:47] God but what what what does your fire
[54:49] look
[54:51] like because you got a way of making
[54:54] this fire grow true and and it ain't
[54:56] something that is extraordinary that you
[54:58] got to do it's real simple that what you
[55:02] got to do you got to make sure you got
[55:03] the fire one that's true amen if you
[55:06] ain't got the fire then there's a whole
[55:08] another steps that you got to take to
[55:09] get the fire but once you got the fire
[55:13] once the fire is inside of you are you
[55:15] maintaining
[55:17] it is your fire growing or is in the
[55:20] same place it was when you first got the
[55:23] fight that means that something you put
[55:26] something there to burn that means where
[55:29] the ashes at that's right is it still
[55:32] under the
[55:33] fire did you get to a point that you
[55:35] decided to pour some water on the fire
[55:38] to make sure it didn't grow it didn't
[55:40] get bigger it didn't expand to this area
[55:42] of my life it didn't expand to that area
[55:45] of my life I want the fire to stay right
[55:47] here I only want one room heated in my
[55:51] house that's the room that I'm in so
[55:54] when I leave this room I'm going to shut
[55:55] the door real tight
[55:57] and make sure that all the rest of the
[55:58] house be
[55:59] cold sometime we do god like that Lord
[56:02] you only allow in this
[56:04] room the rest of rooms I got with my
[56:07] stuff all the stuff that I want is in
[56:12] this sometimes God can come down like he
[56:14] did in Elijah and consume it
[56:17] all he can consume it
[56:20] all but he said but he wants you to
[56:22] examine your fire God had to do that cuz
[56:25] they let that fire go they let that fire
[56:28] burn out so he Elijah had to call for
[56:30] the fire to come back down and he had to
[56:33] prove to them that he was God so he said
[56:35] Lord take the fire the stones and the
[56:38] water now we all know that water don't
[56:41] burn that's what you use to you use on a
[56:43] fire to put it out but the Lord had to
[56:46] consume the water
[56:48] too said are you in a place that you can
[56:52] examine your
[56:53] fire each and every one of us have to do
[56:56] do that for ourselves I can't examine
[56:58] your fire you can't examine mine but I
[57:01] can know if it's
[57:04] burning I can know if it's burning if
[57:07] the Lord allow me you to see you can
[57:09] tell if somebody fire you're burning cuz
[57:11] there's results when the fire is burning
[57:14] there's things that happen when the fire
[57:16] is burning when the fire is burning you
[57:18] witnessing you're talking to people
[57:20] you're having conversations about the
[57:21] Lord I can know when your fire is
[57:23] burning cuz I can see the effects of it
[57:27] I can see the effects and it's not
[57:28] something that you put on it's something
[57:30] that's there it's something it ain't
[57:33] something that you trying to make happen
[57:34] and fabricate it's something that's
[57:36] there it's something that people can
[57:38] tell when you walk into the room that's
[57:40] something different they don't know but
[57:42] it's because the fire is burning but are
[57:45] you examining your fire each and every
[57:47] day and say where is my
[57:49] fire what does my fire look like and
[57:53] what is God trying to show me with the
[57:55] fire that I have
[57:57] cuz when when the Lord wants to get your
[57:59] attended he'll show you and sometimes
[58:01] you don't want to look in the mirror to
[58:04] see that it's because of me that my fire
[58:07] is dying amen it's because of me not all
[58:11] the things that's happening to me but
[58:12] it's because of me and when I look at
[58:15] myself and I see that I'm the issue and
[58:17] I'm the problem I can stop looking at
[58:19] everybody else and realize that Lord I
[58:21] got to get closer to you for myself so
[58:24] my fire can grow I got to do the small
[58:27] things that I need to do to be
[58:29] consistent that my fire will grow I can
[58:32] read my Bible every single day that's
[58:33] something I can do nobody else can do
[58:36] that for me but I have to take the time
[58:39] say Lord I set aside my time that's
[58:41] right to be with
[58:43] you my time and it might not see a lot
[58:46] of times you think that you got to have
[58:48] a big fire starting
[58:50] off well big fires burn
[58:53] quickly and then they die
[58:57] but if you got a small fire that you
[58:59] feed you feed a little bit you feed a
[59:01] little that fire can grow bigger but
[59:04] it's able to be maintained it's able to
[59:06] be maintained you can get around the
[59:08] edges and feed it from the outside and
[59:10] it's able to be maintained it's not
[59:13] something that's wild and it dies
[59:14] quickly it's something that's growing
[59:17] it's growing but it's being able to be
[59:19] maintained it's a kept fire and see when
[59:21] God has that fire in you he can grow it
[59:24] can grow and it can grow God can do the
[59:26] work that he wants to do inside of you
[59:29] but have you examine your
[59:32] [Applause]
