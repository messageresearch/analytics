God is good amen we want to look at the Book of Leviticus the 26th chapter by the grace of God God is good amen Leviticus 26 and we'll begin here at the at the third verse little something the Lord put on our hearts if you got it say amen amen and it reads and if you walk in my statues and keep my Commandments and do them then I will give you rain and due season and the land shall yield her increase and the Trees of the fruit of the Trees of the field shall yield her fruit you may be seated read down a little further and your threshing shall reach unto the Vintage and the Vintage shall reach until the sewing time and ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely and I will give you peace in the land and ye shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and I will rid evil Beast out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land and ye shall Chase your enemies and they shall fall Before You by The Sword a five and five of you shall chasen 100 and a 100 of you shall put 10,000 to flight and your enemies shall fall Before You by The Sword for I will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply and establish my Covenant with you and ye shall eat old's store and bring forth the old because of the new and I will set my Tabernacle among you and my soul shall not of you and I will walk among you and I will be your God and you shall be my people I want to drop down to here at the at the 18th verse and if you were not let's start 16th verse I will also do this unto you I will I will even appoint you Terror consumption and the burning egg that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of the heart and ye shall SW your seed in vain for your enemy shall eat it and I will set my face upon you and against you and ye shall be slain before your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you and ye shall flee when none pursueth you and if you will not yet for all this hearken unto me then I will punish you seven times more for your sins and I will break the pride of your power and I will make your Heaven as iron and your Earth as brass and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yielder increase neither shall the Trees of the land yield their fruits may God blessed to the reading of his word just for for a short moment tonight and I just want to kind of just go over a lot of it I want to talk about challenging God's order amen e e e e ordered it that's how it's going to be however God called it out that's how it's going to be so when we talking about challenging God's order right we that can be a good thing or a bad thing when I say challenging it because you can you can challenge God's order in a way to where you're asking God to keep his word right you're asking God to to keep his end to the deal right and many times he asks he not many of times but I know it's in Malachi 3 he even told him he says uh to prove me right and see w't I do what I said right because God's got order what the way God said it that's the way it'll be and that's you know we find in sometimes that that even in in that that's our strength right that that's our stronghold even in that know that the way God ordered it that's the way that's the way it's got to be no matter how bleak a situation might look no matter how uh uh worse the situation might get right if the way God ordered it come on and if you keep holding on you keep staying faithful steadfast and in the will of God no matter how Bleak it is you watch God show up because it's one thing that God can't do and that's break his word he can't do that he can't he gonna keep all his promises it's not not a time where he'll say I can't come through this time right or I'm not able to do it this time it's never a time that that that that God will ever it'll ever be that way because you know what God is he doesn't need a a uh this support or that support he's a Creator All In by himself right amen he's omnipotent he's omnipresent God is he is all all by himself right he doesn't need support from this and that all he wants is is somebody to believe him for one come on it's not that's why we say we walk by faith and not by sight it's not what you see but it's what you believe in right but I say challenging God's order a lot of times you know uh uh uh people and that's why we say that God is saying if you didn't do this you didn't because people for some reason they don't want to do what God asked them or only part of what God asked them put it that way but they want the blessings you find that I've been doing a lot of witnessing lately at the job you find a lot of times people want the good and they want the blessings right they want to chase a thousand they want the the the Earth to yield its Harvest to them they want this they want that but then they don't want to walk in his statues they don't want to do all that God asked them to do but they want the blessings right so what happens is they get the flip side and then instead of lining up with God or or making things right then they try to go another route around come on but you can't break God's order you can't challenge God's order right you only put yourself then on a downward spiral let's say it that way right because and it's some people that go to that extent but I don't know about you tonight but I say one thing about it uh uh uh we look at the the economy and everything shaking we you know look at the the things that's unfolding and it's only one Safe Haven right it's only one thing right now and I know it's been in my spirit that only one thing that I'm got all of my confidence in right now and that is all of my confidence is in that God is going to keep his word that God is going to keep us even in the midst of all of this crisis God is going to keep us come on that's why all my confidence right now you know it it I was praying think yesterday laying laying there and I was just meditating on the Lord and I said you know God I'm just going to I'm I'm praising God and saying Lord you know telling God how Mighty he is how Mighty he is how powerful how great he is these things don't move me because of the god that I serve these things don't move me come on whatever God takes you through bringing you through right sometimes you don't understand you you might uh uh uh question ask why but it's one thing you know that that he is still the master of the wind he still got it all un control right you're not intimidated not shaken by these winds because you know whom you serve you know I was talking with a guy the other day uh at the job and he was you know going and he was saying he study this he's that and and and you know sometimes you can be unstable because you don't even really know what you believe right something new come out then you fallowing that something new come out you fallowing that so you don't really have no stability right but once you it's one thing about when you find that Solid Rock when once you you know I was sharing with the young uh uh uh people the other day not the my little children and the niece and nephews about experience with God I said no matter what you got to have your own experience with God when you get a personal experience with God you know the Lord ter trials and lives and Sh things in this life uh uh uh going to come right but once you know God for yourself once you met you know the pillar of fire as we say once you had an experience with God is nothing can shake you from that and the trials of life it's things in this life that's going to come and it's going to try your foundation that you own come on it's things that's going to try your beliefs it's meant to be that way but one thing about it when you went deep enough come on the hardest wind can blow you know where you standing at you know I was sharing a guy last night some and testimonies of of the trials of life and I said the thing is when this thing hit you know sometimes people ran to the wrong Source right for relief for the wrong source for to ease the pain right now they find themselves way in the worse mess right than it was from the beginning I says but when all these things were happening and all these things were going on I said there's one thing that held me together and that was God himself right I said the Holy Ghost in those times cuz he was talking about the Holy Ghost I don't think you really know what it is but I said what the Holy Ghost does in those times you know when you can't hold it together when you don't have the answers and it comes like that sometimes you don't know you don't have the answers you but in those times when all your strength is gone those times come on that's when he takes over come on he gives you what it takes to endure through whatever you're dealing with come on but if he's not there you going to have it Harden come on if he ain't there you going to find out in those times you wasn't where you thought you was come on that's the truth come on cuz God will get you sometimes you you can handle situations now because you but when when when when that Storm Come hard enough Hallelujah come on it'll come hard ones will come then you're going to find out was you built for it or not right you'll find out but one thing about it I'm I'm so glad tonight that God has showed me over and over again that he'll never fail he showed me over and over again that he's that solid rock hallelujah winds blow God showed me over and over again I'll never fail you amen he showed me time and time again that it ain't you it's me anyhow hallelujah oh Jesus but when I think about those things that's what I was I was sharing with fellow last night I said sometimes you know we can be so saved to where you forgot where God brought you from So You Don't Have Mercy and compassion and Grace on others cuz you forgot where God brought you from I said but if you were like me one day h Hallelujah you were so deep far out there I didn't know it one time but God when he open your eyes to see the condition that you really were in Hallelujah and how much of God's help you needed and he helped you from then on you can't never look at nobody a certain way right you pray for you'll pray for people then right but I said God's got order doesn't he come on and to stay in God's order is to be blessed y'all believe that tonight I know you do but to St God's order like I says I was reading even here in Leviticus and looking I says oh how God wants to bless us how God loves us how God you know he wants to take care of your every all and all he ask you to do like he said the beginning if you walk in my statues come on God help us to walk but people they want all those bless they they they skip that part if you're walking my statues they want everything else right come on but God's got order and that order can't be broken you know one thing I was sharing with my my my in-laws last night I says one thing about you know challenging God's order you know a lot of times the problem we have today is everybody want to be somebody is that the truth everybody want to be somebody right I was sharing the guy the other night I said one man tell you he got it all or they got it all and you following this man he got it all I said he ain't got it all I said God is too too big and too great he can't he he can't have it all like that right but people that I said everybody want to be somebody come on everybody want to be the man of the hour don't they I was preaching the other night but it's the truth ain't it but you find out a lot of times you wasn't built for it right I thought about Moses when when God Called Moses Moses tried his best to get out of it didn't he he's beg God no Lord not me don't put this burden on me right A lot of people wouldn't have done that would they but he didn't want it he' rather just stay normal comment but God said no I've called you so look at the I was looking at the the things that he went through right to be a leader he went through some stuff didn't he with his own family come on with the own people that he went through a lot and I could see maybe his heart's burden for those people because he knew God was going to bring judgment he know no good wasn't going to come out of it right sometimes what they got to do their own thing breaking not going to do their own thing or or want to do this we going to do that we going to do that most knew the order of God and it couldn't be broken and I can see his heart bleeding sometimes when he tried to stop the people right but they get mad with him Hallelujah many times God would have destroyed him but Moses the leader the one they kicked up against right called him all kind of but he was the meekest man wasn't he and and and one they didn't know he was back there standing before God lord don't destroy many of times right come on I says but the problem he had in the camp everybody want to be somebody didn't they come on I thought about thought about um his sister I said God God's order in God's order right it ain't going it's no Family Lines right no friendships and all that when it comes down to the order of God now God don't got no respect to persons right but he does have respect to officers come on that's the truth ain't it many times people just think oh it's a brother or sister whatever come on but I was thinking about how Miriam I think it was numbers 12 and how she begin to says God only spoken to Moses see want to be somebody right and God may have used them and he did use them come on God did speak to them did use them but at that time Moses was the man of hour wasn't he come on he didn't want to be it but he was right and all he was trying to do was give them a word from God right all he was trying to do is stand there and take them to places that God want to get them to but he had to fight with him and struggle with him the whole way to get there didn't he Hallelujah come on cuz everybody want to be somebody ain't it come on Miriam knows that God only spoke more he spoke to us her and Aaron but the Bible says God heard it come on God heard it didn't he come on God is listening right now God was listening last night wasn't he God heard it come on and he comes down to visit the people sometimes don't he come on that's why I said Lord let the words from my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight because God is listening amen God heard what you said at home didn't he God heard it Hallelujah and he came down didn't he sometimes Hallelujah I was I was sharing this the other night sometimes people kicking fight come on it's God's order Moses didn't want to tell people what he was telling them half the time do all this but he had no other choice did he that's what God it was God placed him there he didn't put himself there did he and God had to come straighten it out one day didn't he Hallelujah and that's what it is everybody want to be somebody come on but I believe if God as God straighten it then he'll straighten it out now come on and you wish that that that God wouldn't allow that to happen I mean the Judgment would fall that people everybody would just find their position and place Hallelujah that we can go on in and see the power of God right oh Jesus but we found that and God heard it didn't he come on he came down and and I and I was saying you know God was pretty upset about what they say about Moses he was pretty upset I say he was upset one of the some of the terminology he used when he smoked Mir with Leprosy and all of them I can see like I said Moses being their natural brother right I can see him heart hurting I can see him burden down that oh just cuz that was that was his natural family right but one thing about it God had order come on he he began to tell him he says if any spiritual among you now he wasn't denying that some of them didn't was spiritual but he said I speak to him Vision a dream he said but not so with Moses right come on you ain't Hallelujah he he he began to talk to him that way right but Moses begin to please don't let him don't let him die please don't kill him God right but God something he said it it's kind of like hit me real hard he was saying something about it about Miriam he said it if her father spit in her face wouldn't she be unclean and God I said Lord but he made her go without the camp I says the thing about it is I said God's got order right and and that's why you always teach your the children your children all that to respect the ministry right don't pick at people you see them in don't don't do that I it don't matter if they part of this church or not don't don't pick at preachers don't pick at don't do that you you teach them respect right because God is his order right God don't got no respect the persons that man might even be a whatever he is but you still respect that office don't you come on but I say one thing about it you know they challenge it many times the order of God was challenged wasn't it I a want to be long tonight but many of times God's order was challenged wasn't it his order was was challenged I remember I think it was number 16 how they they in Corridos right Moses was pleading with them pleading with them he says you know I'mma let you know that men don't choose God God choose men come on but today what happens men choose their themselves don't they come on Hallelujah but he says God I'mma show you God chose men God chose them he said I ain't brought myself here but but this was God God's doing right I'm speaking to you in the name of the Lord this is the Lord speaking come on they was Levites and that they had their offices but they wanted to to magnify the gift that God gave them and put it on the platform that God didn't design it for didn't they come on but at what expense did it cost come on what like I said challenging God's order they want to challenge but I I can see Moses praying for him right but God told Moses at one point he says tell everybody separate yourself from them come on you know I've been looking at all of all the Lord been dealing with me with all these things right I says once you when you in God's order God's program it's a beautiful thing ain't it come on when you when you when you're in the program of God it's a beautiful thing right even in your storms you can tell that person all is well Hallelujah in your storm because you know that God is still in control in a storm all is well that's a beautiful thing come on Amen because you you walking in the program of God Amen you just keep holding on you just keep standing you just hold on God is going to show up he promised he would that's his order amen amen come on it's a beautiful thing Hallelujah that you can tell somebody Hallelujah that my testimony is going to be way better than what I my trial that I've been through right come on oh Jesus come on but when you ain't in God's program it's a sad thing right is the opposite the complete opposite but one thing about it you you can't you ain't going to make God change like that come on you ain't going you you ain't going to do it right in the hidden things sometimes the the the outward man we can't see the hidden things God can see them though right come on Hallelujah one thing about it like I always say Lord we naked in exposed before you right the sometimes I I'm I I just the other day that they um was was going on in the meeting oh Ernest done come back the night shift things about to change now the plant manager said that right so here I go I said yeah it's about to change now for the good right but I went and got in prayer right after I left work I said because God I don't say it like that because I know one thing you wouldn't fix nothing if it weren't for God revealing showing you giving you knowledge and that's the truth you don't just say that to be humble that's the truth come on you let God move his hand off of you you see that's what it is everybody want to be somebody right Ernest coming back tonight everybody want to be somebody but the thing about it is you know all God don't got no respect to persons he do respect officers but it's God the whole time y'all believe that tonight come on that's the truth hallelujah I says the the unconscious things and I I don't want to be long tonight but the unconscious things right come on examine yourself examine your spirit examine your walk come on God's got order you can't break that order come on you got to get in line with what God what God is doing or you'll be left behind come on you got to get in line with what's God doing or you'll miss out on all the blessings you can't do it your way Hallelujah even though God give you the the ability to choose he put life and death before you just like he did them and but but he let you know come on you can choose whatever you want but you choose your own way it won't work out choose your own mind and thoughts it ain't goingon to work out come on you be on a downward spiral and I'm going let you keep going until you learn how to humble yourself Hallelujah that's what he's saying to us tonight [Applause] [Music] amen praise the Lord amen God has order amen amen praise God set in order first apostles then prophets and evangelists pastors and teachers amen God has order amen one thing I I said uh book of Acts experience one thing about it the the apostles they came together and when it was something out of order they came together or they needed directions the guidance they came together and they prayed together and see what the Lord would all have the Gentiles to do and Apostolic order is to understand if we want a book of Acts then we got to act like the the five4 ministry acted in the book of Acts they had Elders he said ordained Elders in every city that means that somebody had to ordain the elders in every city you know when I was a d Apostle as a young man I didn't know all about what Apostle job was but God sent somebody and sent somebody else to ordain me and a couple of people to ordain me I didn't know why God was sending people to ordain me because in the organization I was in I was a minister but when God sent a prophet and told him to ordain me as an apostle I said you know to us that was the highest calling to be ordained as an apostle and I looked at myself I said God you know so later on I saw a bishop he came and I was his Pastor an elder and I was his pastor and then we had another Elder and I was his Pastor I said oh Lord and and they were looking up to me and respecting me as their Pastor I said but that was going all against the order of the organization and the denomination that was going all against that because you almost go by longevity who been here the longest then you next you next you next and you sat there the longest get to be the you know you is and when the Holy Ghost got to hold of Paul Peter said he had to listen to Paul because why God revealed things to Paul that he didn't reveal to the rest of them he said Paul spoke some things hard to be understood and some folks have done stable on Earth you know the R against them to their own destruction isin that right so by the grace of God God will God got order but the Holy Ghost set the church in order amen and the Bible said he gave some Apostles amen not men gave you that but you know we are so sided in our thinking of did man give you a office of this and man made you this and man made you that but what God made you so God got an order he'll make you what he wants you to be you may not even understand God or make you what he wants you to be but when we make ourselves something then we become nothing amen and then God Amen he'll vindicate he'll vindicate if it's God he'll vindicate amen the prophet said if it's God he'll bless it amen you want to know what you your gift is just or that then you see whether or not God bless it or not amen see it all it's all right to have a church full of people but you can have a church full of devils are you with me but if people lives are not getting in one Accord with the word then what good is a big crowd if they're not going to be in one Accord with the word you can have the biggest buildings you can have the biggest Crow but we want people people that love the Lord but don't mind praising the Lord don't mind giving God what's do to you got to have people that's sincere about their soul and their Destiny people that want to go to heaven people that want to see Jesus people that love the Lord amen uhhuh you can't beg people to love the Lord amen amen many uh many are called a few chosen are you with me praise God I'm so glad that it's just a few chosen I'm so glad I'm one of them amen so God got to call you he got to predestinate you if he don't do it then you know sometimes we we feel so sorry for people oh I feel so sorry I do I cry it makes you cry cry for folks and cry for people that take makes their wrong choices and you cry and you cry for people that seem to be rebellious and seem to be a they don't listen and you you you can't tell them anything and and you cry you cry for their soul because you don't want their soul to be lost because one day they might not listen to you but that mean they don't listen to God either goad if they don't listen to you they ain't going to listen to God are you with me because if you telling them what thus said the word it's not you it amen it's the word you know it's a it's a gift that God give you if you got a gift of singing a gift of musician or whatever that gift come from God nothing that you did to deserve it it was freely and given by God am same thing he gave some amen Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers amen the Bible say said

Abraham was standing in the Gap standing in the gap stand in the Gap Lord if it be 10 he said if it be 10 I spare he come to the point okay God that's it if it ain't 10 do what you got to do you know do what you got to do a lot of time we stand in the gap for people that's rebellious and are Hardy and hard and won't listen we stand in the Gap Lord have mercy on Lord have mercy now do what you got

that his Mercy runs out the fire had to fall the fire had to come on Sodom the water had to come the flood had to come why it doesn't matter how long no stood in the Gap all of those years maybe 100 or so years he stood in the cap but it was time God said come on no come on in no and one day God summ his his ministry in come on because you're preaching to the total loss now they can't be saved now you're preaching to the total loss Souls that are in prison now the total law you'll preach to them but they can't be saved they total loss only the preaching will be a testimony against him when he went down the preach to the souls in prison when he preached to those Souls those Souls couldn't come [Music] in but he had to preach to him just as who what Noah was telling you longsuffering of God waited on the day to knowah why the AR was prar weigh in few that was eight Souls the prophet said it come a time it'll be to the total lost you won't be able to have mercy you won't be able to be saved then you'll be totally lost we're getting to that close to that time where you won't come and I want to be baptized you have no desire to change you have no desire to live for God have no desire to praise him you'll be totally lost it's all over God will take that desire away Mercy runs out the Holy Ghost Lift It Off the Earth he's LIF lifting gradually that's why amen the anointing is lifting gradually when people used to climing on fire it's lifting God is taking his Spirit off the Earth gradually so that's why the people are having entertainment they're having almost like an entertainment place people jumping up and down and running and just having entertainment and if you ain't jumping and shaking and you know making yourself almost like you're happy it's an exercise class but the spirit of God and the power of God and the anointing moving and people being delivered no they still living like they used to live there's no change in their lives they just religious now they go to church but they don't change they the word but they can't change why the prophet said there'll be spiritually dead spiritually dead still living but spiritually they're dead people still having church but spiritually they're dead spiritually they're blind spiritually they can't see why because they don't want the word he said I canel the by me assab that you might see a't that right but they don't want the assab they don't want to put it on why because they think they already see are you with me because why they said I'm a rich and I'm increasing good and I have need of nothing so don't tell me because I don't need nothing cuz I'm rich I'm increasing good God is blessing me and I'm blessed don't tell me if God blessed me and gave me all of this and you tell me God expecting me to live a certain way and to do certain no no spiritually dead we come to that cycle we come to that time where there's no real move of God except in the bride and that's an individual thing don't you wait don't you wait till it's too late to make your mind up you want to be a Christian don't you wait till the door shut when the AR was shut the door was closed when the ark was shut the door was closed somebody said there was no rain for 7even days but the door was shut judgment hadn't struck yet the rain the flood had not come but God Usher them in and God is ushering you and I
