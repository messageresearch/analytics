[28:03] revelation
[28:04] by god's grace revelation the second
[28:14] chapter
[28:16] is good amen
[28:24] revelation 2 and we can just begin at
[28:28] the
[28:30] begin at the first verse
[28:37] you got to say amen and it reads until
[28:40] the angel
[28:41] of the church of the ephesus write these
[28:43] things saith he that hold the seven
[28:45] stars in his right hand
[28:47] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[28:48] golden candlesticks i know thy works and
[28:51] thy labor and thy patience
[28:53] and how thou canst not bear them which
[28:56] are evil and thou hast tried them which
[28:59] say they are apostles and are not
[29:01] and has found them liars and has borne
[29:03] and has patience and for my name's sake
[29:05] have labored
[29:06] and have and has not fainted
[29:09] nevertheless
[29:10] i have somewhat ought against thee
[29:12] because thou has left thy first love
[29:14] remember therefore whence thou art
[29:17] fallen
[29:18] and repent and do thou and do the first
[29:21] works
[29:21] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[29:24] and will remove that
[29:26] candlestick out of its place except thou
[29:29] repent but this thou has that thou hate
[29:32] is the deeds of nicholas which i also
[29:34] hate
[29:34] hear he that hath an ear let him hear
[29:36] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[29:39] to him that overcometh will i give to
[29:42] eat
[29:43] of the tree of life which is in the
[29:45] midst of the paradise of god
[29:47] the god of the blessed green of his word
[29:49] you may be seated
[29:51] i want to go down a little further to
[29:54] the 18th verse
[29:57] and continue on it it dropped down to
[29:59] the 18th and it says
[30:00] until the angel the church of thy tower
[30:02] write these things
[30:04] saith the son of god who hath his eyes
[30:05] like into a flame of fire and his feet
[30:08] are like fine brass
[30:10] i know thou works in that charity and
[30:11] service
[30:13] and faith and thy patience and thy works
[30:16] and the last to be more than the first
[30:19] notwithstanding i have a few things
[30:21] against thee
[30:22] because thou sufferest that woman
[30:24] jezebel which called herself a
[30:25] prophetess to teach and seduce my
[30:27] servants
[30:28] to commit fornication to eat things
[30:30] sacrificed unto idols
[30:32] and i gave her space to repent of her
[30:35] fornication and she repented not
[30:37] behold i would cast her into a bed into
[30:39] them and them that commit adultery with
[30:41] her
[30:42] into great tribulation except they
[30:44] repent of their deeds
[30:46] and i would kill her children with with
[30:48] death and
[30:49] all the churches shall know that i am he
[30:53] which searches the reigns and the hearts
[30:55] and i will give unto every one of you
[30:56] according to your works
[30:58] but unto you i say and until the rest of
[31:00] thy torah as
[31:01] many as have not this doctrine and
[31:04] which have not known the depths of satan
[31:07] as they speak
[31:08] i will put upon you none of none other
[31:11] burden
[31:12] but that which you have already hold
[31:14] fast till i come
[31:16] and he that overcometh and keep it my
[31:18] works until the end
[31:19] to him will i give power over the
[31:22] nations and he shall rule them with a
[31:24] rod of iron and vessel potter
[31:25] shall they be broken to shove shivers
[31:28] even as i receive him of my father and i
[31:32] will give him
[31:33] the morning star he that hath an ear let
[31:35] him hear
[31:36] what the spirit says to the churches
[31:39] tonight by god's grace
[31:41] just for a moment i want to talk to you
[31:44] and i entitled it
[31:45] the window of opportunity with a
[31:48] subtitle space to repent
[31:50] amen space to repent
[31:53] you know just look in here and you know
[31:55] we can
[31:56] read on further down but you know just
[31:58] for the sake of time
[32:00] we're talking i want to dwell more on
[32:02] that on that space to repent
[32:04] you know it's something how uh each age
[32:08] you know god here was speaking out
[32:11] you know he was calling out to the
[32:13] angels or the churches but
[32:15] he was telling them uh john i want you
[32:17] to write these things
[32:19] he says because what he was identifying
[32:22] was
[32:22] spirits that would you know attack the
[32:26] churches or be in the churches
[32:27] throughout all the ages
[32:29] but you know it's something like i i
[32:32] it's about god how in each salutation
[32:36] that he gives out
[32:37] what it is is a call to repentance
[32:40] it's a call it's a call to get back
[32:44] to where you left off at it's a call to
[32:47] expose
[32:48] the workings among you spiritual
[32:51] workings among you
[32:52] to let you know that hey you're not
[32:54] where you where you should
[32:56] be and i'm giving you an opportunity a
[32:58] space
[32:59] i'm giving you a call to come back to me
[33:02] and that's what we love about god is
[33:04] that
[33:05] god you know his graces is just
[33:09] something
[33:10] that's what we call it amazing grace his
[33:12] grace is
[33:13] something that we don't deserve never
[33:16] would we deserve it
[33:17] from the way we was born we was born
[33:21] uh uh sinners you know should have been
[33:23] cut off
[33:24] uh from the womb but god
[33:27] by his grace come on so when we speak
[33:31] we only speak about the grace that god
[33:33] has given us
[33:34] you know i think i says lord you know
[33:37] even yourself whatever
[33:39] you do or or if you speak it it's just
[33:42] you
[33:42] it won't have no faith but i can only
[33:44] speak to you
[33:45] concerning the grace that god has given
[33:48] me amen
[33:49] so we live our lives only by the grace
[33:52] of god
[33:53] so we find that here like it says he's
[33:55] called it's a call
[33:57] uh uh to to repentance though
[34:01] the majority of the of the people
[34:04] you know would fall or the majority of
[34:06] the people wouldn't
[34:07] uh take uh uh opportunity
[34:11] like we said that window of opportunity
[34:13] that space to repent though the majority
[34:15] wouldn't
[34:16] take that space to repent you still had
[34:19] a select few
[34:21] and god knew that it would only be a few
[34:23] you know the bible says straight as the
[34:25] gate
[34:26] and narrower is the way and only a few
[34:28] gonna find it
[34:29] so but yet he still extends that that
[34:32] creates that call out because he knows
[34:35] that
[34:36] he's gonna have somebody to receive what
[34:38] he's saying
[34:39] and somebody that's gone won't you know
[34:42] they're gonna see themselves
[34:43] as i believe in the mirror of the word
[34:46] and go see how wretched and undone they
[34:48] are and they gonna realize that lord i
[34:51] need
[34:51] more of you the church world is going on
[34:54] but god
[34:55] what i got ain't enough lord i need i
[34:58] need an
[34:58] overflow and like david said lord let my
[35:01] cup
[35:02] run over he knew he would have somebody
[35:04] that would come to that so he called
[35:06] that's why he says
[35:08] after each salutation to him that
[35:10] overcometh
[35:11] come on hey you know sometimes the world
[35:14] wants you to settle
[35:16] but you don't have to settle because god
[35:18] already declared that somebody gonna
[35:20] overcome
[35:21] somebody and what it'll be it'll be his
[35:23] elect it'll be the wheat
[35:25] it'll be his bride come on then you
[35:27] ain't overcoming by
[35:28] none of your ability because you know we
[35:31] talk about it's not by might nor about
[35:33] power but it's by my spirit
[35:35] sayeth the lord come on and we know that
[35:37] when the capstone was coming they were
[35:39] shoutings of grace and
[35:40] that's what it is it's going to be
[35:42] something that oh that overcome
[35:44] but it's gonna be because when they gave
[35:46] up come on
[35:47] when they got when they got to where
[35:49] they couldn't bear it no more
[35:50] god did the rest how many believe that
[35:52] tonight and i thank the lord for that i
[35:55] say is what it is
[35:57] god works in windows you know
[36:00] it's like we call it seasons and and
[36:03] cycles
[36:04] it's windows you know of opportunities
[36:06] come on
[36:07] you know i remember when i first got
[36:10] saved and you know i had to
[36:11] had to learn that you know you can't
[36:14] always
[36:14] pray like you want to because sometimes
[36:17] your your body or
[36:18] just the present things you're going
[36:20] through won't allow you
[36:21] to to stay as in prayer as you would
[36:24] desire
[36:25] come on but it then it's those seasons
[36:28] where you're able just to pray you're
[36:29] able just to get in there and just
[36:31] flow and the spirit of god come down and
[36:33] that's what it is what it is
[36:35] it's a window of opportunity it's it's
[36:38] space that god is
[36:39] is giving come on and then in those
[36:41] times
[36:42] you you you you uh uh get
[36:45] all you need in those times you store up
[36:48] in those times because maybe what i
[36:50] would say is
[36:51] the winter is coming but nevertheless
[36:53] it's windows of opportunity
[36:55] that god is is working through
[36:58] by god's grace so you know it's windows
[37:01] of opportunity for healing
[37:03] you know god is some opportunity
[37:06] sometimes
[37:06] god he gonna heal you as i was sharing
[37:09] with with somebody
[37:10] even in the scriptures i said that you
[37:12] know the lord said when i came to heal
[37:14] you
[37:15] i found iniquity among you come on the
[37:17] people was crying out for healing
[37:20] and god said i came to heal you but when
[37:22] i came to heal you when that space was
[37:25] open
[37:25] when that window was open i found things
[37:28] among you that i couldn't work among you
[37:30] he says but you got to get that right
[37:32] and i believe that
[37:33] the bible says come let us return unto
[37:36] the lord
[37:37] and he will heal us come on they had to
[37:39] realize that
[37:41] god you know he'll heal us but let us
[37:44] return to him
[37:45] i was sharing with the church on sunday
[37:47] i said the thing is
[37:49] you know he says he that i mean to his
[37:52] children
[37:53] he says that all they that are called by
[37:55] his name
[37:56] that if they humble themselves and pray
[37:59] come on
[38:00] seek his face and turn from their wicked
[38:03] ways he said then i'll
[38:05] hear from heaven and i'll heal you i'll
[38:07] share and i said it don't do no good
[38:09] to pray if you ain't gonna turn come on
[38:12] it don't do no good to cry out if you
[38:14] ain't willing to turn
[38:16] from your wicked ways turn from those
[38:18] things that's
[38:19] holding you back but you know what i
[38:21] said sometimes we don't get desperate
[38:23] enough
[38:24] sometimes the devil ain't beat us up
[38:26] enough i was sharing with my brother
[38:28] i said the thing is i said everybody
[38:30] rock bottom ain't the same i said but
[38:32] you'll know it when you get there come
[38:33] on
[38:34] and sometimes the lord has to do that
[38:37] take you down a little
[38:38] further or get you because god you know
[38:40] you being his child
[38:42] you being his seed he ain't gonna let
[38:44] you go
[38:45] he got you in in the palm of his hand he
[38:47] ain't gonna just let the devil have you
[38:49] so things might get rough and shaken but
[38:52] that's the time
[38:54] you know uh god i was sharing with
[38:55] someone to call the other week and i
[38:57] said the thing is
[38:58] i said god sometimes gets us in those
[39:01] places
[39:01] that we can get rid of the other voices
[39:03] that surround us
[39:05] get along he'll cause people to forsake
[39:07] you he'll cause everybody to walk away
[39:09] from you to get you alone
[39:11] that you can be able to hear from him
[39:13] and i don't know about you but i say
[39:15] when god
[39:15] does that hearing from him means
[39:17] everything
[39:19] hallelujah how many believe that tonight
[39:22] but he says he that hath an ear come on
[39:25] let him hear
[39:26] god works and it's a call to repentance
[39:29] he works in
[39:30] in in windows and in opportunity
[39:33] you know even like we said tell my
[39:35] healing we always share with
[39:36] with the young children that you know
[39:39] about receiving the baptism of the holy
[39:41] ghost come on
[39:42] it says that the thing things only
[39:44] happen in certain atmospheres
[39:46] so when the atmosphere is right then you
[39:48] got the yield to god
[39:50] you can't just sit there like you don't
[39:51] know what to do you got to raise your
[39:54] hand sometimes
[39:55] you got to learn how to enter in come on
[39:57] because why
[39:58] now god is pouring out a spirit i think
[40:01] about those on the day of pentecost when
[40:03] they were up in the upper room
[40:04] come on they stayed there for so many
[40:06] days and we know that the prophet god
[40:08] was talking about them
[40:09] written and work out their differences
[40:10] but when they were in one place and one
[40:12] mind and one accord what happened the
[40:14] atmosphere got right
[40:16] it was a window it was an opportunity it
[40:18] was space and time
[40:19] where god was pouring out of spirit come
[40:21] on was it
[40:22] about to pour out of spirit you didn't
[40:24] want to miss that opportunity
[40:26] you don't want to miss that opportunity
[40:28] even here now
[40:29] you know i don't believe god is done
[40:31] with his people yet
[40:32] if he was done with his people then the
[40:35] rapture would already taken place
[40:37] so it's not that we say that the revival
[40:39] is already passed
[40:41] we know that maybe in the mass calling
[40:43] but god is still working with
[40:45] individuals
[40:46] your revival is still here right now
[40:48] come on all you got to do is enter
[40:50] entering god is calling out to that
[40:53] select few come on
[40:54] and said i'm doing something right now
[40:56] can you see what the lord is doing
[40:58] that's why he says he that hath an ear
[41:01] let him hear
[41:02] i said god open my ears tonight god give
[41:05] me spiritual wisdom and understanding
[41:08] because it'll keep calm as a thief in
[41:10] the night come on
[41:11] when everybody else is slumbering and
[41:13] sleeping remember
[41:14] there was a midnight cry that went out
[41:17] and and after you when that midnight cry
[41:20] went out some found out they didn't have
[41:22] enough
[41:22] all that what the the go out meal
[41:26] so they went to go by all but they
[41:28] didn't know it was too late
[41:30] the window of opportunity that they had
[41:32] they wouldn't have that space to go out
[41:34] and buy oil
[41:35] so when they went out the bible says
[41:37] that the door was shut
[41:39] and they was left out of the marriage
[41:41] supper come on and i said right now
[41:43] is our space in our window of
[41:45] opportunity god
[41:46] like we said he called out throughout
[41:48] all ages whatever he doing
[41:50] calling to a space of repentance that
[41:52] first age he could see them getting off
[41:54] he could try to call them back they
[41:56] wouldn't come back come on majority of
[41:58] them then you could see the next saves
[42:00] and how further and further it got away
[42:03] from
[42:03] from the original how further and
[42:05] further it got away but nevertheless
[42:07] god still had a remnant even in that
[42:10] the thy tyrannies you see how he says
[42:13] that that i gave her space to repent and
[42:16] she repented not come on
[42:17] but even in that how he cast judgment on
[42:21] the age
[42:21] he still has some he said it's still a
[42:24] few that ain't defiled
[42:26] it's still a few that hadn't known as he
[42:28] said the depths of satan
[42:30] and he said and unto them come on he
[42:33] says i want you to hold fast until i
[42:35] come
[42:36] hallelujah we think about it even now
[42:39] you know in the age and in our
[42:42] uh ease that we live in i was thinking i
[42:45] said
[42:45] you know i was looking at something and
[42:48] i said oh god
[42:50] how much the the music has drifted away
[42:53] how much the music has gone come on
[42:57] and you know i was looking at something
[42:59] and what it did it grieved your
[43:01] heart real bad because i said the thing
[43:03] is the music
[43:05] come on was supposed to be something
[43:07] that uh
[43:08] brought the presence of god down was
[43:11] supposed to be before they went out to
[43:12] battle they called for the musicians
[43:15] go out come on and and play
[43:18] get the atmosphere right that when the
[43:20] word come forth
[43:22] people can be delivered the presence of
[43:25] god is already there before the preacher
[43:27] even come out
[43:28] the music was supposed to be something
[43:30] that god used
[43:32] hallelujah you know david when he played
[43:36] the heart when the evil spirit was on
[43:38] saul
[43:38] come on it was it was a presence in that
[43:41] it did something
[43:42] it lifted the evil spirit off of saul's
[43:45] life but look at what the devil has done
[43:48] look at how far away the people have
[43:50] drifted come on
[43:52] satan has come in but i said god you
[43:54] know it's i believe that
[43:56] god can give us the right the right
[43:58] tunes come on he can give us the right
[44:00] song he can give us
[44:01] the right spirit to bring it back come
[44:03] on lord i said lord we desire that
[44:05] when we sing and when we worship god
[44:08] your presence can come down and do
[44:10] something for us
[44:11] get to get the atmosphere right that
[44:14] when the word come
[44:15] hallelujah we're welcoming christ on the
[44:18] scene
[44:18] we'll welcome him into his presence
[44:20] somebody need healing
[44:22] somebody need deliverance somebody life
[44:25] needs to be changed
[44:26] get the atmosphere right hallelujah
[44:30] and i believe that you know i was i had
[44:33] to go and
[44:34] do a little procedure the other day and
[44:36] he was asking me what kind of music you
[44:38] want to listen to and i said
[44:39] i said only you know gospel they said
[44:41] well what kind of gospel and they name
[44:42] some names i
[44:44] was like no no and then it was like well
[44:47] then that's like
[44:48] i said just maybe some southern gospel
[44:49] or something so they got to
[44:51] put it on my ears and and i went in to
[44:54] do the procedure and
[44:55] the first song was seemed to be pretty
[44:58] nice the next one was some rap gospel
[45:00] stuff
[45:01] and the next song seemed to be a pretty
[45:03] nice next one with some rap gospel stuff
[45:05] i said lord have mercy you know just
[45:08] listening to it but
[45:09] i was beginning to think i said lord i i
[45:12] thought about i said it's the truth come
[45:14] on
[45:14] you know you think about in that first
[45:16] stage he says he says i know thy words
[45:19] come on
[45:19] he said and he said and i i he he
[45:22] uplifted them
[45:23] he says because you got patience he says
[45:25] you you hate those
[45:27] uh uh the nicholas and which also hating
[45:30] all these things said but i got some
[45:31] ought against you
[45:32] because you left your first love he
[45:34] began to talk to them
[45:36] about the drift come on you know it
[45:38] might start as a drift
[45:40] but if you don't get a hold to it if
[45:42] that anchor if you don't put that anchor
[45:44] down in
[45:45] inc and uh contain that drift then you
[45:48] will begin to look back and you'll be so
[45:50] far out come on
[45:51] that you won't be able to get back to
[45:53] the presence of god you think about it i
[45:55] said that's what it is
[45:57] when when we see our lives or are god'll
[45:59] expose it see ourselves
[46:01] going in a drift i said god ankle me
[46:03] back down
[46:04] god refill me again god do something
[46:07] lord that i can get back right with you
[46:09] god because i don't want that drift to
[46:11] get me so far away from you that god i
[46:13] can't see your presence
[46:15] hallelujah how many believe that tonight
[46:19] but it says that you know he's called he
[46:21] called out
[46:22] you know to each age a salutation you
[46:25] know of a
[46:26] call about calling out a repentance i
[46:28] see where you are
[46:30] but i want you but i want you to you
[46:31] know to come back to me
[46:33] i want you i want you to come back come
[46:35] on get yourself
[46:37] uh uh back in tune with me come on

[46:47] there's
[46:48] there's those you know that don't
[46:51] it's like you got to take your christian
[46:53] journey serious come on
[46:55] it's got to be something you know in
[46:57] your heart
[46:58] you know they talk about in in the end
[47:01] how the wheat and the tears
[47:03] would be so intertwined together that
[47:06] you wouldn't even be able to tell the
[47:07] difference
[47:08] come on until when until the harvest
[47:10] time
[47:11] see they talk about the tears then they
[47:13] can talk about it but they won't go all
[47:15] the way in come on
[47:17] they can't go all the way into the new
[47:19] birth why because
[47:20] the the seed isn't in them but the weak
[47:24] they'll go all the way in but look how
[47:26] deceptive it is that they'll be so
[47:28] intertwined
[47:29] that you won't even be able to tell them
[47:31] apart come on but i thank god that god
[47:34] has put something in us that we never
[47:37] believe that we've arrived or we've

[48:19] know even as
[48:20] as paul you look at even in his whole
[48:22] life he was always
[48:24] pressing he said i pressed horse mark he

[48:48] give to eat
[48:49] or the tree of life come on no longer as
[48:52] you see the chairman's
[48:53] guarding that tree but god has restored
[48:55] us now
[48:56] that we can go back to that tree come on
[48:58] we don't have to stay out here and die
[49:00] come on but you can cross you can pass
[49:03] from death to life

[49:11] and starve to death
[49:12] eat of the tree hallelujah
[49:15] you got access tonight you know god has
[49:18] opened the book and it's and it's
[49:20] accessible to you and i come on
[49:22] the book is open as we see the battle
[49:24] between god and satan
[49:26] come to a head god is lifting up lifted
[49:29] up a standard
[49:30] for you and i we're expecting to do the
[49:32] greater works
[49:33] we're expecting to be restored back to
[49:35] when we speak god
[49:37] uh life comes about hallelujah why
[49:40] because that's what god promised us
[49:42] that's how we got the fight come on we
[49:45] ain't gonna be able to fight the enemy
[49:46] on our own
[49:47] you know thinking about how i was
[49:49] reading up upon some things and
[49:51] how the roman catholicism and and how
[49:54] even now today how they was saying about
[49:56] the baptism and
[49:57] i was sharing it with my wife the other
[49:59] day and how they were saying
[50:00] that they was about about this baptism
[50:03] and correct if you've done it that way
[50:04] but what in a lot of
[50:06] the churches are feeding into it come on
[50:08] a lot of them saying they got to
[50:09] go and redo it again all these things i
[50:12] said but what it is
[50:13] intellectual men come on being
[50:16] demon possessed come on
[50:19] smart and make it sound good
[50:23] make it sound right but it's doctrines
[50:25] of devils
[50:27] i said we need more than just
[50:29] intellectual teaching
[50:30] but where's the power where's when the
[50:33] man of god
[50:34] speak i don't want to see what you're
[50:35] talking about show me what you're
[50:37] talking about
[50:38] hallelujah i believe when peter spoke
[50:41] the word
[50:41] the holy ghost fell come on hallelujah
[50:45] i said that's what it is and and you
[50:47] know
[50:48] we look at how how we said the age is
[50:51] drifted that white horse rider
[50:52] come in come on with false teaching he
[50:55] know that the first thing he had to do
[50:56] was get him off of the word
[50:58] get him get him away from the word begin
[51:00] to mix in it then he can come in and
[51:02] bring all kind of chaos
[51:03] all kind of havoc to it drifted to a
[51:06] place the way god
[51:07] he's saying come on y'all got to come
[51:08] back and repent y'all got to come back
[51:10] to him
[51:12] but even though he knew that the
[51:13] majority of the world wouldn't come back
[51:15] he found even in the layout of cnas he
[51:18] says behold i stand at the door and
[51:20] knock
[51:20] come on think about it having church
[51:24] without god in there
[51:26] he had the door knocking but the cry
[51:29] now is not just going out to the church
[51:32] but he said he that happened
[51:34] here come on you open the door to me
[51:37] come on
[51:38] i'm gonna commune with you i'm gonna
[51:40] suck with you
[51:41] when nobody else ain't getting this
[51:43] hidden man i'm gonna suck with you
[51:46] i'm gonna reveal to you things that the
[51:48] world don't know about i'ma give you of
[51:50] that hidden manner how many want that
[51:52] tonight
[51:53] i thank the lord that says what it is
[51:55] space don't you know that
[51:57] you know the call has gone out but one
[51:59] day
[52:00] you know that space to repent that call
[52:03] that door will be shut one day that door
[52:06] gonna be shut
[52:08] and he that is holy let him be holy
[52:10] still he that is filthy let him be
[52:12] filthy still
[52:14] it ain't that god didn't call give us
[52:16] space
[52:17] and opportunity open the window but
[52:20] we rejected the call we harden our
[52:24] hearts
[52:24] but as we said that few come on that
[52:27] elect
[52:28] they are here to call they'll hear what
[52:31] the man of god is saying
[52:32] they'll hear as the word going forth and
[52:35] it'll do something for them how many
[52:36] want to be in that
[52:37] select few tonight but we thank the lord
[52:40] i say the thing
[52:41] is you know you and i as individuals
[52:45] we said you know those windows of
[52:48] opportunity
[52:49] you know made me think about those that
[52:51] were at the uh
[52:52] pool of bethsaida come on you you
[52:55] couldn't you didn't have time
[52:57] as you was waiting on the angel to come
[52:59] in you didn't have time to get up and go
[53:01] to do nothing to go and check on this so
[53:04] go that
[53:04] but you had to be there because you knew
[53:07] that there was a space
[53:08] there was a window or when god was gonna
[53:11] come down and trouble the waters
[53:13] so not were you just only sitting there
[53:15] but you were waiting
[53:16] i said that's what it is come on are you
[53:19] expecting now are you waiting you want
[53:21] the expectation
[53:22] for god to do something you know i said
[53:25] we don't just come to the house of god
[53:27] without expectation but we come to the
[53:29] house of god
[53:30] expecting lord if it don't happen this
[53:33] service i'm looking forward to next
[53:35] service
[53:35] if it don't happen the next service i'm
[53:37] looking for the next service you coming
[53:39] under expectation when you get down on
[53:42] your knees you coming under expectation
[53:45] god i want to learn how to let go let
[53:47] you have your way
[53:48] let go hallelujah lift me up to a place
[53:51] what it is you expect
[53:54] as long as you're under that expectation
[53:56] when it happens you won't miss it
[53:59] hallelujah because you were waiting on
[54:01] it
[54:02] you think about it it says you had to be
[54:04] there when
[54:05] when the water was troubled you had to
[54:07] get in hallelujah

[1:03:29] bride tabernacle thing
[1:03:34] it's it's it's it's a holy ghost thing
[1:03:37] it's god himself doing what he
[1:03:40] promised he'll do with the word
[1:03:43] you want me it ain't it it's not say
[1:03:47] i'm a metro's believer playing uh uh uh
[1:03:50] uh uh uh
[1:03:50] uh uh uh i've been baptized in jesus
[1:03:53] christ's name
[1:03:54] that it ain't all about that it's about
[1:03:56] god
[1:03:57] it's about a revelation that god speaks
[1:04:01] to you
[1:04:01] and reveals himself to you as an
[1:04:03] individual
[1:04:05] are you a man and if you're not
[1:04:08] manifesting that which god
[1:04:10] is doing you just got head knowledge and
[1:04:14] uh and you got a letter but the letter
[1:04:16] killed it but the spirit gave
[1:04:18] life it's too many people amen
[1:04:22] they know the letter backwards and
[1:04:24] forward but when the letter becomes
[1:04:26] life they can't recognize it
[1:04:30] are you up man
[1:04:34] i bet they said blind as a bad
[1:04:38] because they can't see light when it's
[1:04:40] made manifested
[1:04:43] they see it as long as they looking out
[1:04:46] of their
[1:04:47] own intellectual glasses
[1:04:50] amen but when it comes in a way
[1:04:54] that their intellectual mind cannot
[1:04:56] comprehend it
[1:04:57] then they let it pass on
[1:05:00] because i i don't know what he's talking
[1:05:02] about
[1:05:04] i don't know understand but revelation
[1:05:08] amen gives stimulation
[1:05:12] and brings about manifestation
[1:05:16] and god will vindicate it

[1:07:07] tonight amen and understand the space of
[1:07:10] time that the lord has given his people
[1:07:12] and
[1:07:12] just thinking about that scripture but
[1:07:14] learners took where they fell away from
[1:07:16] their first love
[1:07:18] and to think how powerful that first
[1:07:20] love is
[1:07:21] and all that first love has done for us
[1:07:23] now is not the time
[1:07:25] to lose the the the ecstasy of that

[1:07:44] i wish i could explain it but i cannot
[1:07:47] he said this third pool he said it
[1:07:50] cannot
[1:07:51] it was an unknown tone the last part of
[1:07:54] the seal and he said
[1:07:57] i could not make that out but he said i
[1:08:00] believe that's the coming of the lord
