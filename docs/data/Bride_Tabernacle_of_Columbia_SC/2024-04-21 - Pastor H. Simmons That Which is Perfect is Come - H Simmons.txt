touch those ones that's sick and Afflicted those that are going through battles oh God and trouble in mind trouble in heart father you said let not your heart to be trouble help us oh God to realize that we can trust you we can cast every care upon you because you care in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you may you bless your word in Jesus name amen the book of First Corinthians 13 you know I was saying many times we got to to cast every care upon him but we got to trust that God can handle whatever you've been through whatever you're going through you got to trust God with it just talking to brother Isaac this morning about trusting the Lord amen we can't trust ourselves we got to trust the Lord amen God is good 1 Corinthians 13 I read the first you read the next and we read the last verse together though I speak with the tongues of men and angels have not charity I am become a sounding brass and a tanken symbol to and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I have the give though I give my body to be burnt and have not charity it profited me what nothing four charity suffer does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoke thanth no what evil sixth Beth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and doth what all things eight for we know in part and we prophesied in part 10 when I was a child I spe as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things 12 see together now by faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated you know I I thank God he says we're talking about that when that which is perfect is come when that which is perfect is come and you know it was told us by the Bible and Jesus said in Matthew 5 be perfect as I perfect said in Hebrews be holy for I'm holy are you with me so when we look at what God requires the church say when he comes back for the church or comes back for his bride it'll be a church without spot rankor blemish or any such thing so God is looking for a perfect church or perfect indiv for you and I to be perfect so if Perfection is required then there must be provision made whereby we can be perfect amen if a Perfection is required then that must be amen if there's a deep call it to the Deep then there's a deep to respond amen if God is requiring Perfection then God is able to bring that to pass in our lives when that which is perfect is come now we want also talk to the the greatest gift of all amen God is when we speak of love and we think about God is the great Fountain of love amen God is the great Creator he's the great Fountain of Love first John tell us God is what God is love but we find ourselves battering every day you and and I and ourselves cannot love the way God wants us to love but it's not it's only because his love is given to us by the Holy Ghost the Bible tells us the Holy Ghost is the love of God sheded abroad in our hearts in Romans 5 so the love of God now what what's going to keep us everything else going to fail us but the greatest gift is what the greatest gift is love and love never in uh in 1 Corinthians 13 and8 it says charity never charity never fail amen everything else a fail but charity never fail and we sing this song he never fail me yet Jesus Christ never fail me yet everywhere I go I tell the world I want the world to know that Jesus Christ what never fa never failed me yet amen amen amen so when we associate amen never fail amen charity never amen you know I rather be guilty of loving you too much than anything else amen are you with amen see sometimes we find it difficult to love when it looks like uh an individual have done you wrong but the Bible tells us Christ amen forgave us even when we were yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly now the gospel message we can have all kind of inter mment in church but the gospel message is God so love you amen the world that he gave his only begotten son amen whosoever believe in him should not perish but have what Everlasting everlasting life now when we talk about the Greater Love uh the great the greatest gift for I mean St John 15 St John 15 God is good St John 15 and I'm just going to start at the 15th verse St John 15 and 15 amen he starts off I'm the vine I'm the True Vine my father is the husband amen but the 15th verse says uh the 13th verse says greater love has no man than what Greater Love greater love amen that which is perfect has come love amen God's Prophet said back in 54 and then he comes back in the church ages and said in that love is that which is perfect has come recycling over and over that which is perfect is come going beyond the curtain of time that which is perfect only perfect love can enter here are you with me so you and I must have perfect love perfect love when we speak of the perfect love we we're talking about where is divine uh perfect love of God rests in our hearts it seals us are you with me so the greater love has no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friend I'm going tell you something he says you my friends if you do whatever I command you are you with me he call you friend if you do now if you're not doing what he said now I want to do you love him the question is do you love Jesus huh I said do you love him you shouldn't he said if you love me what keep my commandment folks tell God I love you but the tree is known by what that's it the apple is not the what the apple is not the tree but the apple is the fruit that come off the what amen if you say you love God then there must be attributes the fruits of the spirit must be there amen the know amen that you really love like God say the love are you with me see we can fake it but we can't make it are you with me see we can tell everybody I love everybody and you you don't even love your own body amen the Bible said no man hath his own what flesh when we do any kind of thing to our own body to destroy it then we don't even love ourself the Bible say your body is the what the Temple of the Holy Ghost and you know that God dwells in amen if a man destroy God's Temple how can you love God and you hate your own Temple but you said I'm helpless God I need help but he's here to help you do you really mean you want God to help you praise God folks said God help me Lord and God comes to help you and you say uhuh not like that see when God H amen he comes to help you because he love you Jesus so loved the word that he he he came down and saw the condition of man amen he saw that we were in a state that we couldn't keep his word amen so the word amen was made flesh God Amen oh come down in the Virgin and came down as a baby amen wrapped in swallen clothes come down the gift of God Amen the Bible says the gift of God was wrapped up in swallen clothes God's a love gift the gift of God is eternal life amen the wages of sin is death amen but the gift of God is eternal life isn't that right so God's gift to you and I that were in sin dead and trespass in sin couldn't get out locked up in the prison house amen of sin amen bondage by the things of the world Amen but God so loved the world Amen that he gave his only begotten son amen God loves you enough to Die For You amen amen it doesn't matter how they Hoop It Up and how they how wipe it up amen it's got to come down into your heart as a reality that God loved me and and I got to understand Can I Trust You Lord You Love Me can I trust you can I trust you with my soul can I trust you with my life can I trust God Amen if I give it to him amen can he maintain amen can he keep me somebody says he's able to keep you from falling amen he's able to keep you when Temptations arise God is able to keep you he can keep you amen as our brother minin said here keep you if you want to be kep amen if you don't want God to keep you he not going to keep you amen amen if you want to feel sorry for yourself you don't have to feel sorry amen for he said let not your heart be TR no no no no no you don't have to be troubled like that amen the things we go through is because we fail to give it to God Amen if we own would give it to God and said God I Trust You Lord I trust you with all that I'm going to amen hey God I trust you now amen amen I know you're evil say charity never never faileth the love of God will never fail you amen amen I said he'll never fail you amen he never fail me yet amen everywhere I go I want the world to know that Jesus Christ never fail me yet he won't fail you praise God you can trust him you can depend on him you can have confidence in him am I don't have confidence in me am you can't amen praise God you can say well I got confidence in your preacher oh come on I want you should have confidence in him amen are you with me because he's the one that amen we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord amen and ourselves your servant amen amen First Corinthians I mean first John I mean not first John St John 15 15:15 okay henceforth I call you not what call you not servant for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have call your friend for all things that I've heard of my father I have made known unto you you've not what when you hear that inner voice you hear that that that still voice calling the Deep calling to the Deep it's it's not you that making the decision to give your heart and your life to him amen it's the voice of God that comes to visit you and to speak to you amen and to tell you I love you amen amen why don't you coming to me amen it doesn't matter how much labor and burdens you have amen come to me all you to leave in heaven lat and I'll give you that's all you want I want rest amen I'm tired of this whole world and the things that I'm going through I want rest but you got to come to him amen if you only would come oh yes he'll make he'll give you that rest give you that peace somebody said I can't rest at night amen but God wants to give you rest amen for your soul amen praise God the amen the doctors can give you all kind of medication and all kind of stives and all kind of this and that but you still can't find rest but I thank God that there's a one that I could go to come to me he says am and I'll give you rest am do you believe it amen I said has he done it for you because I know he's done it for me and I know he'll do it for you if he did it for me why not you am he'll give you rest all you got to do is allow him yes he said you I know it wasn't my choice cuz as a young man I wasn't ready and now in three score and 10 I'm so glad that he chose me are you with me I didn't make my own decision because I wasn't ready I don't know when he came by knocking at your door of your heart was you ready because I said I ain't ready I don't know how got here but I said I wasn't ready I was too young I hadn't done something some of the things that I had in my mind to do I had things that I wanted to do places I wanted to go things I wanted to achieve I wasn't finished with sin I had just begun to sin hard but he came by KN I wasn't ready he said you've not chosen me but it's something about that small still voice I knew it wasn't me that made the decision God made a decision I'm calling you you know they used to have that song Uncle Sam say I want you amen when the draft was on he said I want you and God said I want you it's the best thing that ever happened to me I said it was the best thing that ever happened to me I thought I had unfinished business but that when Jesus spoke to my heart I knew it wasn't me speaking to myself I knew it was something different about that voice I had things I wanted to be places I wanted to go things I wanted to achieve but God called me I remember that day walking off that football field that's it that's it I can't get away from it no more said that's it walked off the football field and I says God call it but I dare not tell anybody God call it because they would think that God calling you to preach boy and I ain't going to do that so I ain't going to tell nobody I heard the voice people you know you do strange things when God speak to you come on I wasn't Superfly no more are you with me all my nice hats and cool n go after one wasn't worried about that no more had those shoes could how to walk in walk man I'm about to fall out you know but God call you when you when it come you you change the way you dress nobody have to tell you I I I I I want you to change you just do it automatically why because it's something talking to you am you can't explain it amen no you in trying to tell FK so with the difference I wasn't dressing to impress no more didn't care what you thought about me I didn't care about all the compliment that folk would give you man oh you cool none of that no more see we we we when the love of God comes none of that stuff matters anymore God call you amen there there something down in your heart it's no more trying to please men but pleasing God no more trying to please yourself but to please God I want it to please God now everything didn't happen overnight but little by little amen I started getting rid of this getting rid of that little by little my mind my vision for my future begin to change my eyesight got clear what I seem to want didn't matter anymore I didn't want those things no more they Wen the first and foremost thing in my life and when Jesus come in you forget about yourself so Lord what will you have me to do Lord what is your plan for saving me I know you got something amen you save me for a reason and for a purpose now what do you want me to do amen praise God I wonder if folks really get SA or they just turn over a new Leaf or decide to make a little decision and come to church and you know go through the motion but Salvation when he really saves you praise God you God what what you want me to do cuz I know it's a reason for amen you coming to me and calling me Lord what do you want me to do surely there's a work that I can do something that you can do that's why God save you am I gotta pick back up here I gotta he choos here he said in 16th verse you're not chosen me but I chose you and ordain you that you should go and what 16 verses but you can go and what look at somebody says where's your fruit you have any how many people have you wanted Christ just how many people have you wanted Christ you know I said in mull the other night you working for somebody if you ain't working for God you working for somebody and what when you work you expect a good what pay so the fruit that you go and what bring forth fruit where's your fruit now Jesus saw a tree as K said the other night he saw a tree and didn't have no figs on it didn't have no fruit he said why come you to ground what's your purpose for being a f tree if you ain't got no figs what did he say about the fig tree cut it down in What occasion say cursed and and it would because he expect fruits God is expecting fruits of your life he expect oh Lord he says that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit May should What Remain not only is it exterior but it's internal it internal not only he expecting you to reach out to others but God wants fruits of the spirit to be manifested in your life are you with me now if you don't have any fruit brothers and sisters when people look at you what do they see what kind of fruit tree is it does it bear the very fruits of the spirit of God or does it bear the fruits the spirit of the world the works of the flesh are the fruits of the spirit are you with me now he says that your fruits May remain and whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he may what he he's going to give it to you 17 says these things I command you that you what I can't stand I can't stand my boss man I can't stand I hate the way she walk look what she got on she don't know how to dress he don't know how to oh Lord this thing don't matter right now do you love him do you have the love of God in your heart I can't love you because you don't go to my church I can't love you because you're not a Christian my mama said I can't hang out with you your mama the light don't have no fellowship with Darkness mama ain't got nothing to do with it Daddy ain't got nothing to do with it can two walk together except they be the what are you with me so what do we have in common are you with me see you you can't bring forth Thrones if you and hiss you should bear good fruit are you with me you're not a cactus with all the sticky stuff a't that right you ought to be easily to be in treated easily to be embraced a't that right but you so don't touch me cuz I'll stick you are you me you you understand folk are Untouchable people they don't have the love of God and I don't mean naturally touch I'm talking about in the spirit real folks have built walls are you with me that they don't want anybody to invade their privacy cuz me and God got a private thing going on are you with me and I have my own individual walk with God and nobody going to tell me I mean they get nobody tell me I don't know the Lord all right all right all right that's all right I know who I it's all right you're fine fine keep it keep it you got it keep it keep it I Ain coming back to the old church folk ain't living right I saw sister some on down the street and I know she ain't saved I'm so [Applause] holy I don't want those Devils touching me please you know some folks I'm saying you know you say oh goodness Lord have mercy they got enough fire in them to run everybody from the church and they they they feeling love hey you see that do you see this goodness Lord have mercy what you looking at you come to church to serve the Lord or you come to church to criticize everybody else I come on man I I said I you know I say it's close to 50 years a pastor man I done run this as a mean Christians some mean people some meanest people and sometime you go in church and they got rules how to put you out they got to write their own rules say if you do this you going I'm going put you out see the scripture tell you how what how to hand the situation but because they want to hand that way they going to write down if if you do this you get out for two years you get out for one year you know so they put all the rules and regulations in place how to put you out Jesus said I come in the world not to condemn the world but the what save it you don't come to church to find out you a sinner you're a sinner you know that you come to understand that there's a God that cares about you and he loves you are you with me well I'm going let you know you're going to have that's where you're going they already know that you don't have to tell them that but but I want to make sure I let you know I'm standing for the truth please why be so mean is that the way Jesus talk to people is that what you call love all right you man they can call people that's in sin all kind of name they forgot they were Sinners one time preacher RI oh that kind of church I want to go to a church where the preacher got some backbone come on you want a mean preacher cuz you mean you want somebody to be mean with your meanness are you with me and somebody said well God work it out God God's love is sufficient let's show some love here and God will work it out if they're a real child of God God's going to straighten those things out that you worrying about don't worry about that God said he never lost one are you with me all that the father giv me there come are you with me don't you worry about you can't make no oh see it's it's folk that too busy sitting people to Hell see what happens is they're trying to make apostol light and when you make him apostol like you make him twofold child of Hell than yourself are you with me there's already onefold then you can to make a twofold you get them self-righteous religious spirit amen amen instead of the Holy Spirit they become religious they would have been better off just being the center than to come to church and get religion and it's just a covering am covering up their meanness are you with me you would have been better off just staying The Sinner and knowing that you a sinner than comeing to church thinking you oh I don't stop smoking I don't stop doping I don't stop D I'm holy I'm Sanctified and these old Devils I don't even want don't smell no alcohol don't get around me I'm holy now oh goodness you know see how you holy oh fine fine fine yeah yeah yeah yeah oh Lord looking down on F don't know where you came from why you looking out on FK you you you know where you came from see folks there's no mercy but people ought to understand that's a god that cares the Jesus that I know of the Bible was a Jesus that looked beyond your falses and he saw what you needed are you with me but sometime we so busy in our spirit I got to finish charity never failed huh see all the spiritual gifts all the spiritual gifts if it isn't mored together with a love y'all know what the m is when the landay bricks the m is the stuff in
