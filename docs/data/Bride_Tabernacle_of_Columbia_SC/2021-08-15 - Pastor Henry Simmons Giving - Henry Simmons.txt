and i thank god for saving me hallelujah praise god where would we be what kind of condition would we be in this morning if he didn't save us says 6-1 take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest die in arms do not sound trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogue and in the streets that they may be that they may have glory of men very i sanded you they have their reward but when i do with arms let not the right left hand knows what our right hand does that not arms may be in secret and our father which sees in secret himself shall reward thee openly god bless you read this word you may be seated the bible says there's more blessed to give than it is to receive we're living in one of the most blessed times and where people are more blessed than ever been blessed but we're also living in one of the most selfish age people of self-senate look like the more god gives the more selfish people become they think about like the rich man he built bigger bonds the second corinthians nine second corinthians nine and six second corinthians nine and six i just i just started reading at the third verse excuse me nine and six like okay nine and six okay but this i say he which so and sparingly shall reap also sparingly if you give a little you expect to receive a little are you with me he didn't source sparingly now you might think that i want to deal with your finances or whatever but i'm dealing with you as an individual how much are you giving god of yourselves i'm not dealing with but it's also if you want to look at that also then it's all right to look at that but i'm really looking at how much of god are we how much of you are you giving to god when we talk about giving to this this morning uh uh see some sometimes we we don't want to give god a hundred percent sometimes it's things that we don't want to give up we want to hold on to and i'm talking about giving are you giving him all your heart your mind your body your soul your spirit are you giving him everything are you giving him sparingly and you're reaping sparingly you don't really you can't comprehend all that the blessings that god has for you because you're not willing to let go there's no there's not enough room for him to bless you the way he wants to bless you because you got other things that are occupying the space where god wants to bless you so if the house is already filled if with something else then god cannot really show you the abundance of his grace and his blessings that he want to bestow upon your life because things are already there amen that he has no room are you with me so when we are preoccupied with the things of this world then god amen blessings that are spiritual blessings that he wants to restore upon our lives he cannot restore the spiritual blessings the things that he wants to do with our lives and things how he wants to use us how he wants to bless us he cannot fully do that until you're fully surrendered are you with me so sometimes we're not totally uh fully surrendered so god cannot fully bless us he can only bless us partially are you with me only that which you allows that which you're willing to surrender to are you with me and sometimes we surrender you know just enough just enough to be saved just enough to be a christian just enough you know to say i i you know i love you i'm you know i i'm faithful you know in our own little small way instead of getting abundancy of grace and abundancy of blessings we only get a portion of what god wants to give to us okay so he he deals with he that so is let me just try to teach this morning he did so sparingly shall reap also sparingly i don't know why we're looking for god to do great things in our lives if we're not willing and we're not we don't have room for it sometimes people want husbands wives and what other things but we don't have room for it the things that god would freely give to us we don't even have a room to receive it why because we're preoccupied we try to achieve and atta attain things on our own as long as you in god's way god cannot do it his way because you're already trying to do what your own way so how can we amen allow god to give us what he wants to give us when we gonna get what we want and gonna say god bless this is which i have i've gotten it for myself but i want your blessings to be upon this which i want instead of saying lord not my will but what see i it is whether or not we'll surrender and say you know it's more blessed to give when you're willing to give yourself completely you're willing to give over to god and you're willing to surrender completely to him you know it it's something to surrender partially you sparingly just a little uh lord you know we can say lord i'm surrendering to all of you but that's your smile i surrender not to renault but that's just a psalm that's just words but am i so have i have i really done that in my daily walk what am i sowing daily because each day we're sowing seeds our action is a sowing a seed you know even when we get up we're sowing seed you know the song says so good see and we're sowing and we're reaping the benefits of what we sow how we think when we get up our attitude you start off with a bad attitude we'll re during that day we're reaping what we sow our attitude we gotta get in a place where where we understand what we sow we reap and we're going to trust god when we get up and thank him for just so lovely day and thank you for all his blessings that he stole upon us and thank him oh god lord i thank you in advance amen for abundancy of grace and all your goodness amen i thank you for oh god blessing this day lord i thank you for waking up this morning with the attitude where you got room the room to reap amen because what you're giving thanks giving i'm giving thanks to you lord i i'm giving room for you and i want you to fill it up with your grace amen so you you realizing what you give is what you reap you reap what you sow okay so he says here if i sow bountifully i'll reap also bountifully not only in your natural giving amen you know you know i put down a name and sometimes i have to you god gives you people in your life and people in the fellowship that would remind you of people that go along with your sermon and i think about the carols for a long time the family that they were you know taking care of a major part of the finances and that's getting where we are today and for years they were you know major blessing but i understood that brother carol had in his mind if i give bountifully i'll reap bound to feel it and so he had that attitude giving bountifully and reaping bountifully amen and god blessed tremendously amen but now i'm dealing with attitude i'm not dealing with the natural i mean he was able to drive a bmw a mercedes this that all the different you know but i'm not dealing with that part i'm dealing with your your attitude towards your giving you see you must have the right attitude to what you're given okay so and because bad attitude given with the wrong attitude you know it's almost saying god should keep it coming to church and you're not coming with the right attitude you know you got to come into his presence amen come into his courts with praise amen you coming to give back to god what he gave to you if you're not coming to give back to god what he gave to you he gave you strength enough to come and when you get here you say thank you for the strength amen you know somebody's lying in the hospital somebody amen lying on a sick bed somebody can't even walk somebody can't talk somebody is just strung out and they can't even think but you want to give to god what he gave to you you know i tell folks all the time look at all your blessings don't look at all the negatives the bible said count your many blessings see what god has done why don't you count your blessings amen count your many blessings so you start counting your blessings not looking at all the failure and all the disappointment and all the trouble and all the stuff that's going wrong look at what's going counting your blessings you know i can see some people blind i can hear some people deaf i can feel some people paralyzed you know what i'm saying you know i account look at the positive and not the negative you know reaping giving reaping what you sow amen if you you become so negative you'll never be able you fill up with negativity you'll never be able to be blessed with the positive so things that are that are a negative in your life you got to turn the negative into a positive are you with me you got to start saying thank you lord i even thank you for the negative things that are happening because it's only going to take me to a positive are you with me i'm putting all my negative situations and only having a positive praise uh i don't know i'm trying to see with two negatives up what two negatives he could kill a negative negative and negative together amen i can't go back then that algebra or whatever it was but anyway you got to put the positive and take away the negative away are you with me and once you do that if you turn it around god will start blessing you and he'll bless you not just a little but as much as you allow as much as you allow god to bless you that's how much he'll bless you but if you only gonna allow god to bless you a little that's all you're gonna get is a little but if you allow him to bless you abundantly you're going to be blessed abundantly now he says every man according to as a purpose in his heart the seventh verse it's all about the heart where's your heart given from the heart giving from the heart giving because it's in your heart to do it now he says every man according has his purpose in his heart so let him what give you know a lot of things we do it because we think that we got to do what we doing and we don't want to do it we do it because mama say do it we do it because daddy said do it we do it because preachers say do it we do it because the word of god said do it we do it well we don't want to do it see a lot of things we do we don't want to do you see what i'm saying but when you want to do it it makes it easy it makes it so much better and easier when you want to do it you don't want to watch those dishes and make those dishes become dirty and they pile up and they pile up because you don't want to wash the dishes you don't want to take the trash out it gets big and get more and more trash you don't want to cut the grass it grows and grows isn't that right it's because you it it gets harder to cut because it's going to grow are you with me but it gets easier when you're willing when you don't mind it you go out there and you cut that grass and you keep it cut because you like the way your yard look when the grass is cut amen and that's the way it is you let a lot of weeds grow up in your spirit are you with me because why amen you you actually grudge and you ah oh i don't want to do okay but when you're willing you feel better you got the right attitude you feel like doing it praise god you know nobody until your mind gets right that you you love god you want to worship god you want to serve god as long as that negative thing is there you know uh as long as you don't want to give you don't want to give god your heart you don't want to get you know it's about that hard you don't want to give him your heart then it's a grudge [Music] it's a strain you know you don't want to give him your heart and somebody said let's praise the lord you say you're looking all around praise the lord they say well let's do this let's go play some ball hey your heart is in the ball your heart is not in god let's go do this so let's go do that that's where my heart is are you with me and you sow to that you reap that but if you sow to god then you'll find that god becomes so real to you amen reaping what you want what you give to god amen that's all you're getting sparingly you get a little man i tried to serve god i tried to do this and i tried to do that that's only your efforts amen it's not him that willing to him that run it but it's god that shows the mercy are you with me you know oh all you got to do surrender lord thy are the potter i am the clay roll me and make me what you want to do amen how you want and what you want out of me lord here i am this is oh god are you with me if you're willing to surrender if you're willing to allow him to make you amen what he wants you to be then you can get ready for your abundance of blessings okay it says grudgingly he did according to as a purpose in his heart so let him give not grudgingly all of what necessity you know i give but i i need it in myself so i you know not a necessity for god love is the word i'm going to tell you something you must realize that only what you do willingly and from the heart and you're glad to do it is going to count and got in god amen singing is all right but if you're not doing it from the heart and you're loving to do it and you're doing it to the glory of god see those others that we read in matthew they did only to be seen the praise of men that's what matthew was all about right yeah yeah they did it they wanted the glory of men they wanted to be seen a man they want to show out amen in our christian walk it's not about us amen a christian life is uh to live for what to live for others not to live unto yourselves but to live for others that's what a christian life is all about living for others not for yourself are you with me jesus christ was our perfect example i got to get down here where i can close out in a minute because i don't purpose to hold you along this morning okay you said and god is able to make all grace abound towards you that ye always having all sufficiency and all things may abound in every what good work see what i'm saying so in every good word god god's going to bless you and make you abound in every good word because your attitude towards giving because your heart is in it so every you know everything you put your hands to god's gonna bless it everything amen that a child of god put his hand to god said i'm a blessing i don't care what you do amen if you do it as unto the glory of god god's gonna bless you god gonna bless your efforts in everything you do all you gotta do is sow good seed amen give with the right spirit give from your heart and god is going to bless you abundantly now i said all that to say this in um saint john 17. saint john 17. i needed to read the whole chapter but i can't do that so i just move right on to the ninth verse amen i want you to know that god's purpose he showed us perfect example in himself that he gave himself for us the bible said god amen the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life now how do we get eternal life it's only through him giving we get eternal life because god gave himself for us that we might receive eternal life isn't that right so it took it took giving for us to receive eternal life and in turn when we receive eternal life we must impart back what god has given to us and if god has given you eternal life then you can impart that back how do you do that all that the father gave me i'm giving i give it to you oh you look man so how are you doing that amen he said if i be lifted up then i what i draw all men unto me amen and i wonder who would help me look jesus isn't that right god amen has invested in you and he has endowed you he's in he's he's put something inside of you and that that's not just something that's his very person inside of you his very life inside of you amen that you might have life more uh abundantly are you with me so oh and i don't want you to take this life amen that god has given you amen and not give it because he gave it to you god bless you to be a blessing now y'all sitting close enough to one another's that your family members just tell somebody god bless you to be a blessing what god bless you know it's something about the in the minute a person is filled with the spirit the bible says you will be witnesses of me you want to tell somebody you want to amen the blessing that god has bestowed upon you you want everybody to be blessed that's just the attitude god you bless me i want everybody to be blessed so what god gives you you want to give back amen so [Music] but you you see a christian that amen don't want to give is it's something wrong with that christian you know i i doubt your salvation when you receive uh the the from god and don't want to give it back amen you receive eternal life and you don't want others to have it amen paul says that in romans 1 and 16 he said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ because it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone believe that believe amen you mean to tell me that you are ashamed of him praise god after all he's done for you and you become ashamed of the gospel i'm not ashamed amen because what he's invested and what he's given me amen i want everybody to have it praise god this life that he's given me amen this regeneration this new amen praise god this is a new man that resides is not me that liveth but it's christ that's living not in me amen the life that i not live amen i'm not living for myself no more i'm not a selfish amen i'm not a i'm not a grudger a spirit i want you to have abundant life i said abundant life yes are you with me oh god i don't want you to receive just a little bit i want you to have abundance life praise god i want you to have health i want you to have strength i i want you to prosper even as your soul prosper i want you to be in health amen praise god so i want you i want to meet you in every in every aspect of your life i want to god wants to meet you in every way and everything that you have need of i want to supply everything all of your needs i want to supply praise god i want you to walk in prosperity i want you to walk in victory i want you to walk in my might hallelujah i want you to have my spirit i want you to have my power amen i want you to have the love that i have hallelujah i want you to have it all amen you can only have it if you're willing to sow are you willing to give if you're willing to sow amen if you're willing to surrender to it him amen but to draw back amen my soul has no pleasure in you amen if i hold if i hold i don't want to give up this i can't stop that but if you're willing to surrender from all of your unbelief if you're willing to steal away praise god if you're willing oh hallelujah so here it is the 17 and 9. he said i pray for them i pray not for the world but i pray for them that god has what given me for they dying you know i'm gonna tell you something it's not no coincidence god know each and every one of us and he knew who belonged to him are you with me so he said i pray not for the world are you with me the bible tells us the word love is what the world loves his own son i'm not praying to the word those folks out there that's doing all kind of stuff the world love his own so jesus said i don't i don't pray for the world are you with me god so loved the world but it comes down to a place that he's in his agony and he's in his mediation mutatorial point and he's praying amen it's getting ready to leave and he says i pray not for the world you said all mine are what and thine uh what and i am glorified where and now i am no more where but these are and i come to thee holy father keep through thy own name those whom thou has what see god has given to you only to give back what he gave to you don't hold it as though you possess it and it belongs to you like that you can become selfish and you hold your fist so tight that you're not willing to lose and give it okay it says all done of mine and eleventh verse she says and now i'm no more in the world oh okay 12 verse while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gave me amen those that i gave me hallelujah and none of them is lost but the son of what that the scriptures might be what and now i come to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my what fulfilled in themselves i have given them by what and the world has what the world did i know you seeking for love we seek for love in the wrong places we want we're seeking for the wrong kind of love and a lot of folks know how to give you the kind of love that that kind of love that people think they need they got to have and they get that kind of love but the love that god wants to give you is his kind of love and the world can't give you that kind of love so don't try to reach out then you know you feel left out you feel but you're not you're not from this planet amen you're from the heavenly amen this earthly it's going to pass away the earthly the cosmos this world of order all of this is going but god got a new heaven and a new earth prepared for you it's waiting on you but you got to be willing to receive it if you don't if you don't open up and and say god i want this this new creation this new amen god made everything for adam and eve and he gave them to be the god of this earth and god said i'll prepare a place for you i go to prepare a place for you god got a place prepared for you and he already knows that you amen something in you desire in that place he says the world hates hate them because they are not of the world even as i'm not of the world i pray not that thou should take them out of the world but thou should keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as i'm not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through thy truth neither pray out for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through what see you're not just believing for yourself to believe on me through their words their people out there are waiting on your word waiting on you to tell them the gospel of jesus christ they're waiting there there are people that you sat around you play with you go to school where you go to work with they're waiting on you just to give them a word and sometimes we're so busy reaping of the world till we don't have time sowing our seeds we're so busy till we're not in tune with the spirit we're not in tune with god we're not listening to him and sometimes you don't have to quote a scripture and you don't even have to say jesus love you amen but in your spirit you begin to be sensitive amen that this person needs god and used to begin to pray and then amen after a while things began to change in that person's life after a while you began to see you didn't open your mouth but you opened up your spirit and you were able to be used to by god what did you do you start giving you stop being selfish amen everything self-centered everything about what i'm trying to achieve and what i'm trying to do you start caring about somebody else jesus amen he could have cared about himself but he cared more about you than he cared about his own life he was more interested in you and i than he was with his own self and i'm saying to you amen god amen wants you to be interested in someone else more than you're interested in your own praise god given that god can give you more said about the rich man how hardly can a rich man enter the kingdom of heaven said harder for a camera to go through the eyes of a needle then the rich man entered the kingdom of heaven isn't that right and you know a lot of times they said the eye of a kneeler was going into the gates of the city the camel going in he had to get down on his knees to get through the gate so he says that was the eye of the needle they were saying that so he had to get down on his knees and crawl through because he was too tall are you with me but he says the disciples said lord we left all to follow you he said no man is left on see what i'm saying you're thinking if i give grudgingly if i really give god my life i'll really give god my all then you know you're hesitant gradually your soul you're so holding on to it like you're gonna lose something that oh but if i give a uh uh a bountifully if i give everything i got to god he said peter disciples y'all left all but hey i want you to know you didn't leave it for nothing she said that not only have i given you a hundredfold in this world but i gave you eternal life are you look man see god just think about it brother and sister oh wait wait till i get this get that do what that mean to god that little bit that you gonna get maybe you become a millionaire maybe you come this to that what that mean to god that ain't nothing amen praise god you know you might need to become a millionaire you might become a a hunting there you know what i'm saying maybe a thousand there never become that millionaire but with god amen praise god your potential he knows your potential and and if you gave god your million amen god is able to make that 100 million amen that's what you would have had if you don't say if i would have pursued my vision but i'm going to tell you something if you give them your vision for the vision of god if you give up what you want for what god wants you to have amen but we're not willing to believe that god knows what's best for us and god has more for us than we can ever imagine more than we can ever ask or think far beyond our comprehension god has more and god wants to give you more god wants to give you more abundance god wants to bless you abundantly amen if you only allow him to do it praise god with your father beyond all you can actually think amen exceeding it abundantly god wants to do it for you and i but brothers and sisters that's because we are not we sparingly barely we so sparingly and sometimes we we're blessed but not to not to the point that amen we could be blessed as long as we got a little blessings we think that we're really prospering prospering was down amen it's almost approximately we we're not saying we don't have god at all we think that we have a potion of god and that's all we need to to get what we want and to accomplish that which we want to achieve so as long as we got a little bit of god maybe some of the the the the great uh professional people in this world they meant to have a accomplished immense uh a billion dollars and they're worth that amen just what would they be worth amen if they would have gave god amen their whole beings and all of themselves amen if one soul is worth more than 10 000 worlds are you with me then what would it you know when a billion dollars means so much to uh they worked so hard and they uh invested in this world goods what happens when this world a volcano hit uh or atomic bomb hit what happens to the investment that they made in this world praise god but what happens amen if they invest towards god they're so good seed amen they sow into the kingdom of god they sow their lives amen they're they're in the hall of fame they're in this or that amen they got their names on different buildings and so forth but what happened their streets are named after them what happens in the kingdom of god when you go down hallelujah vulvar praise god hallelujah praise god when you go down amen the streets that are paved with gold when you go and see amen uh the names of the 12 apostles and the foundation stone and you looked and you said that's my name i'm part of the headstone can't you see my name in there amen the bride and the bridegroom are what one amen so we're in headshot time amen we're at the top of the pyramid and you are placed right there with him praise god you make up a part of the headstone are you with me so brother and sister what what what does that mean that needs all amen all that we've achieved and all that we have attained amen to be a part of amen that which is eternal amen because the temporal will pass away but we sown amen we're sown bountifully and god said you'll reap eternal life hallelujah you'll reap eternal life i'm gonna tell you something brother and sister you have reserved in heaven god has a reserve in heaven amen praise god all that he meant praise god you ever thought you wanted god has reserved it for you in heaven oh hallelujah the blessing that god has reserved amen god oh lord if i don't get it here i know it's waiting on me praise god what waiting on me praise god i might have been disappointed and missed out on a lot of things but thank god i hadn't missed out on god hallelujah i got the eternal that means more to me than this whole world could ever offer me brother and sister's eternity means something eternal life means something are you willing to sow were you willing to invest are you willing to hold back on god this jesus prayed that we be one amen in order to become one you must make a sacrifice on the day of pentecost the bible said they were on one accord in one place suddenly there came a sign from heaven as a rich and mighty wind and they fill all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them clothed in tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues amen i'ma tell you they came to a place where god had filled them with the spirit and then once they were filled with the spirit men looked at them and said these men are full of new wine but he said these men are not drunk unless you suppose seen it's but the third hour of the day but this is that which is spoken of by the prophet joel that in the last days said god that i poured my spirit upon all flesh sons and daughters shall prophesy and young mentions see vision their old men should dream dreams and all my servant and all my handmaids in those days when i poured my spirit and i show wonders in heaven above and signs and earth beneath blood and fire and vapors of smoke the sun should be turned into darkness and the moon and the blood before the great and notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved i wonder what you're calling this morning i wonder if you have enough grace in your heart to call on him why he can't be found are you willing to sow good seed are you willing to reach out into the debt and say god i want to call on you while i can because one day it's going to be a dark and a great dreadful day and men would call and they would cry out to the rocks in the mountains and they shall fall on his heart as from the face of him that satisf upon the throne because the wrath of god will be pulled out well brother and sister you have an opportunity to make your call in an election sure amen you can make a sound decision you can say lord i want to i want to go with you praise god because you prepared a place for me lord i know you got something far more amen weight of glory amen you got more waiting on me can i help you than anything in this world you got amen stored up in heaven amen god is reserved god has stored up in heaven things amen that eyes have not seen here have not heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things that god has waited on you it's on the other side brother but praise god i'm gonna do all i'm gonna give everything i got because i want to be on the other side amen because my blessings lie on the other side of joy if i can only cross and i can get to my promises and god made a way that we can cross your heart jordan represents death when we die to ourselves praise god then we crossed over to the promised land we crossed over to the baptism of the holy ghost we cross over to the blessings of god they remember it takes they meant coming to joy and willing to die out to ourselves amen and paul says i'll die daily every day i've got to die to something praise god brother and sister that the blessings of god might be restored upon us are you willing to give to give of yourself to give your life amen for his life hallelujah he said that they may they may all be one as thou father are in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that god has sent me and the glory which thou had gave it to me i have what 22nd verse i have what i've given them that they may be what one you know the devil will do everything he can do to what divides you i don't want you to try to come on one accord with me as a pastor i want you to become on one accord with him and then i'm striving to come on one accord with him and we all have the same mind to come on one accord with god and that's to become a one accord with his word amen make them one as we are one and by one spirit are we all baptized into one body are we trying to you don't try to please brother simon and don't try to please one another try to please god are you with me give to god your all praise god we're so busy thinking about how they think what they think what he thinks what oh it's not about what they think amen let's show good see praise god those that amen you think hate you amen don't even worry about that thought amen because that don't mean nothing to you they meant the world will hate you and if they are of the world they can't help themselves amen you have an obligation to love them are you with me no matter how much they hate you your obligation is amen because the god paid dwells in you it doesn't matter what they think about you what they do to you amen you cannot make jesus christ hate are you with me you can't make the holy ghost you're grudgingly and sparingly that you're going to love a person just a little sparingly you're going to love them grudgingly amen are you when you give and give amen freely give from your heart freely you have received freely amen what god gave me you freely give it praise god jesus gave his life freely for you and i we give ourselves freely praise god not holding back nothing i'm not going to do because they're going to think no matter what they think amen what god gave to you freely you have received freely give doesn't i i just know they're trying to use me let them use you they use god are you with me you better be careful yeah i'm okay i'm careful because the holy spirit is here sometimes we don't mind what the holy spirit is trying to do praise god the holy spirit amen is trying to do things in your life but you're being so watchful and so careful amen and so mindful of thinking in your mind god wants you to lose your mind and have the mind of christ praise god sometimes we're so protective of ourselves as a selfish spirit brother we're so and sparingly amen we got a selfish spirit because we're always thinking i got to defend my i gotta defend myself amen you you so defended yourself till you're living in a prison you come to church in a prison you go to work in a prison amen you're defending yourself protecting yourself you live every day you're on god you're not at peace in your spirit you got to be brothers and sisters it's time it's about freely giving be willing to be abused be willing to be used jesus christ amen and all that he done for the people they still treated him they still treated him they didn't they didn't care for him after all the good that he's done looked like they would have loved him and appreciated him right no they wanted him dead amen he said the world will hate you are you with me but you got to continually what you got to continually humble yourself and give give amen because the life that he's given you amen is eternal life give it freely willingly not grudgingly don't hold back hey the way you've been thinking forget it brother i know you don't like me but forget it i love you anyhow i know you don't care for me but i don't that's not bothering me i love you you know sometimes we hold back we hold back the brother don't care for me so i don't care for him either that sister don't care for me well just let it go ahead on i'm going to tell you something and that's the way the devil would have it to be have you so separated even in a house of family you got the same mama same daddy look at how they treating her look how to treat me you know what i'm saying same house oh she getting all the attention you know what i'm saying i mean same mama same daddy if it happens in a natural house upon natural children how about in the spiritual in the church sometimes to what we see amen you got to forget about all of that look at joseph and his brothers oh he came over by joseph didn't care about all of us look at all of us and he cared more about that one than he cared about all of us maybe god put it that way you know what you're going to do about it are you going to respond like they did joseph i don't say come on don't worry about it just go do your part and what god gave you to do amen and do it amen know your position know your place amen because it it's going to always be that the devil is always going to inject things to make things look like amen it may not be that way are you look man well because we're dealing with the devil and we allow him to sow amen that wrong seed down in us that wrong thought amen then it'll bring forth amen fruits and those fruits amen we'll reap what we want so the devil the enemy has sown that seed isn't that right who did it amen one man slept the enemy that sold it was the devil he sold tears in the field oh you look man that was friday night he sold tares in the right so the enemy did that now not your brother not your sister not joseph joseph didn't do anything but the enemy's so terrors wrong thoughts then they began to get a spirit of what jealousy and they carried out what they thought amen joseph was without even consciously considering that was their brother and god had given him a gift to deliver them they could not see the blessings that joseph was to be to them but they became jealous of him instead of recognizing the blessing are you up man but joseph had to go through that so brother and sister don't you worry about if god has made you a joseph praise god then don't try to take vengeance on your brother or sister praise god don't you try to sow amen don't let the devil inject you with something that's gonna cause you to look at your brother's sister wrong amen praise god cast down every imagination and everything that's contrary and love the love of god be there i gotta close but be one the devil is divine divide and conquer your divide and he'll keep dividing and he'll keep you divided but love one another for love is of god and everyone that love is born of god are you with me god is good i got two sermons in one so if i was mixing something up
