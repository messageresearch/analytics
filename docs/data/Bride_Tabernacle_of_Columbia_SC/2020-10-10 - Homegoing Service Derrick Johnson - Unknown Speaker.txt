go to the remarks uh two minutes please we start with brother gerald murray then followed by kimone smith then mr sharon baker and pastor aaron bishop amen praise the lord saints um we thank god for this this um gratitude for expressing the life of our brother derrick here and um brother there was like a big brother to me and a good friend of mines he was he was down to earth didn't say that much he's full of wisdom and just by looking at him you would think that he didn't have no wisdom though but once you start talking to him you found out that he had a lot of wisdom and um he didn't he didn't mind importing that wisdom to anybody who's willing to listen and um i learned a lot from him like i said he was very easy going laid back but serious whenever he need to be and um like i said um it's kind of hard standing up here though but you know one of his last well one of his requests was was for me of all people to get up here and um to um speak over him but i said well about to just step up to the plate and you know for a friend and a brother yeah i'll go ahead and go for it um one of the main things that really impressed me about brother derek was he had a very interesting laughter laugh and no matter if he was down and out busted disgusted can't be trusted broke as a joke when he whenever he would laugh if that didn't pick you up nothing would so um brother derrick's he never complained about anything and one of his favorite terminology was um one day at a time one day at a time even with his medical conditions he never you know whined or cried about it and you would never know that he was going through what he was going through but you know he just you know just handled it like a soldier and we thank god for that and um oh one more thing too i remembered um another thing that really stood out to me was was um one time me and sister lisa we was having like a long conversation i i can't remember whether it was outside or over the phone but it was getting pretty deep and brother there he kept going interjecting his thoughts boom boom boom and since at least the first time i ever heard her get mad in all my years she was like um be quiet brother derek i'm trying to hear what brother gerald say and there was like silence and i was like oh lord what's going to happen now but brother derek was like whoa well baby you know i'm just trying to interject the things i know and sister elise was like i know hon i love you though so i said brother derek you handle that like a champ boom but um to sum it up though brother derek loved the lord with all of his heart and he didn't mind expressing it to anybody or everywhere that he went no matter who he met on a job at a grocery store in church outside of church he didn't mind um sharing his love for for god and um that was one of the main things that really impressed me about him he wasn't ashamed of the gospel and um you know thank god for him um i watched my daddy transform to a man when i was a kid and i gonna never forget my daddy put it back in my hand and he told me go out and give everything you got it takes a lot for me to stand up here because my daddy went perfect he didn't have to be perfect he just wanted me to be the best i can be he had this slogan holding the road when his nights were dark and his days were dark he's still held in the road when he was going through his condition he still held it in the road and he's looking down at all of us right now holding the rope and i promise and i appreciate everybody my daddy was a good man praise the lord everybody my name is sharan baker and i work with mr johnson um he worked at mentor for 13 years and i've known him for five of the 13. i was his program director and when they asked me would i come and represent where he worked i took it as an honor because he gave so much he gave everything that he had he carried many titles you know some called him mr johnson some called him dad some called him pop some called him a friend i called him a friend um because it didn't matter what situation was going on or what we had going on and not within our agency he always came with some nice spirit and he would call and just miss baker how you doing i'm just checking on you to see how you're doing and i took that as an honor because i didn't know anybody when i moved here i've been here about six years and the one thing that kind of connected us is because we're both from new york he's from the bronx i'm from brooklyn and so i knew exactly how to handle him give it to him straight i didn't have to beat around the bush i didn't have to sugarcoat anything and i respected him for that and you need to know that your husband gave a lot your father gave a lot and we're gonna miss him we're really gonna the guys are gonna miss him so mourn for him now i i do because that was my friend and he meant a lot to us so i just say thank you for allowing us to have him for the time that we did for the last 13 years and for the five that i knew him he was awesome and mentor is really going to miss him there's something missing within our company is because he's not going to be there anymore so if you crossed his path he always has something nice to say and i can remember a time when his vision started to deteriorate a little bit and i called him i said mr johnson um can you bring the van to me so we can put some gas in it and he didn't care he said okay you know miss baker i'm on my way because he had to come to the office anyways i was like well why is it taking him so long to get here it only take a 15-minute ride it was like 45 minutes and he hadn't gotten here yet so i was like okay i called him i said miss johnson you okay i'm coming somebody came in they said miss baker mr johnson riding the break the whole way there i said mr johnson do you want me to take the van here's mrs baker can you drive the van he said it's going to take me too long i said okay so but he didn't allow that to stop him from doing what he needed to do he did his job to the end and that's to be respected and we will miss him so once again i say thank you for allowing us to have him for the time that we did and my condolences to you and the family from south carolina mentor praise the lord everybody i bring you greetings on behalf of grace christian church which is a building off of monticello road if you've never been by there where the sweat equity of derrick still lives for those who don't know the history of my family and the power family we were one family two families that moved to a neighborhood called belvedere from new york and one of the things that jesus teaches us is to love your neighbor and derrick is not just a neighbor he was a brother because we became family by way of the neighborhood relationships but also by the way of relationships through mentorships i stand in a capacity that i don't feel i have the work to fulfill because i stand in a position speaking from the legacy of my father my father loved the boys in the neighborhood he wouldn't do anything to disturb their development but he'd do everything to lift them out of their changes and the thing that i remember about derek is that he desired to work out his soul salvation and my father would pick him up every day come on in your your daddy would walk down the street and ride with my daddy every day and it was the joking moment is when derek would ride with my father kamani would come knock on the back door and stay in our house for the whole day and so we we were neighbors we were one family and my dad mentored derek and i saw that change you just spoke of come on in and i saw him work with my dad and receive so many life lessons and wisdom and because of that derek became a mentor to me see when you are in a relationship with your father and you're trying to listen to your father there are times where you don't want to listen to your father but then there's a big brother like derek who helped rough out me smooth out the rough edges derek was that i thank god for him today because some of those moments when me and my father was about to get into it derek would step in and take me to the right up to the left and help lift me see that's what being a neighbor is all about but it's more about just being a worker because iron sharpens iron and when we shape each other through rough times and bad times that's when we become better because the bible says in revelations the 14th chapter the 13th verse workers will rest from their labor but their works shall follow them and their workers shall not be ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ today there's no reason to be ashamed of the hurt of death but i will tell you that you should give god all the glory all the honor for the wonderful works he has done through derek because his works shall follow him hold it in the road commanding because when we look at what god has done through his life it's a reason to give him all the praise in closing let the praise of the lord continuously be in your mouth we've been we may endure for a night but joy shall come in the morning and the joy of the lord shall be a strength on behalf of grace christian church and especially the bishop family we stay here and we'll always be here because we love our neighbor god bless you amen praise the lord um some kind of way they miss me i'm gonna say two two two minutes says you got me two minutes in jesus name i'm the uh worship leader here at the fellowship at the bride tabernacle and i've known brother derek since we moved here in 2003 i believe and i've never seen brother derek without a smile on his face any time you see brother derek you're going to be blessed because he brings joy amen a genuine joy and i just want to express that that's all it was we love him i know we're going to miss him miss him right there in that back pew there with sister lisa but we know he is with the lord brother derek love the boy and we love brother derek hey man we're going to ask uh sister carrie c wright for a prayer for the family at this time amen praise the lord everybody praise the lord everybody god is still good in spite of god is good i do honor the lord it's my lord and savior jesus christ the pastor of the great church and all the clergies that's on the roster and those of you that's in the audience and most of all the bereavement family i want to say to you be strong god is yet able to do exceededly and abundantly and above all that we might think are asked according to the powers that work is within us i thank god just to be able to stand just one more time i can say the last time i was able to uh really speak with my brother was in 2017 which is three years and five months and that day i was in the process of going to have a knee replacement but i gotten a call that he had just had some heart surgery and i could not go into that hospital without going by just to say a prayer with him and his wife and i thank god that i was able to do that and i feel good because i believe in giving a person that flowers while they are living so at this time let us pray heavenly father in the mighty name of jesus although god has we come together this day this time in this hour oh dear god we yet want to say thank you we want to say thank you for being jehovah jorah we want to say thank you for being our provider we want to say thank you for being jehovah rapha our healer we want to say thank you there god heavenly father we understand and realize that you've been so good to us you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves so many hearts are heavy today but heavenly father we know that you're a heart fixer you're a burden barrier and you're a mind regulator there's nothing too hard for you heavenly father give us strength when we're weak and braces up on everything inside heavenly father we want to say thank you their god because they could have been the other way but we understand and realize that there is a season and there is a time and heavenly father because there is a season and there is a time we understand that you have a plan and we know that this is the plan that you has for dairy but heavenly father we ask that the family will continue to be strong and just look to the hills from which all of your help come and knowing your help come from god and all he's the one that made the heaven and the earth he is the one that made the moon and the stars he's the one that said i will never leave you never forsake you but always remember you never alone god said i would catch every teardrop that falls from your eyes and i will count it as a blessing it's all right to cry it's all right to cry and always remember that earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal so be strong in the lord and always remember that you are not alone god is yet with you sister lisa he would be that husband for you kimani he would be that father he would be that brother for you whatever you need him to be god is right there all you have to do is believe and call on him he's never late he will meet you right where you at so don't let your heart be troubled today just look to god and if there's anything in your heart today that is keeping you from crying out lord deliver me do it right now so many times we go through so many things and we go through so long because what's in our heart we don't want to be delivered but we can't see the master until we be delivered from whatever it is be strong in the lord and know that god loves you and i love you too amen we thank god for his love amen now we'll have a selection by sister marilyn simmons and sister natasha days [Music] amen i just wanted to say that um god blessed us to speak to brother derek last wednesday my son went by the house because he was a mentor to him he loved brother derek he just kept us laughing kept us going and he hadn't seen him in a while and he was so happy to see him and he was so happy to see us they facetimed us on the phone and brother derek and sister lisa was so happy and i just wanted to say he was a blessing to us and our children and he'll never be forgotten by us i find it an honor a privilege this was one of his requests too for me to sing and he was not just a friend or brother he was a mentor to me uh he used to get on me about my son so much that was his guard dad too and him and joshua had a hilarious bond that um only god could break really together now thank you somehow [Music] i made it [Music] somehow i made it through it all god's part [Music] i've made it somehow i

the song is said i will lift my eyes unto the heels for which comets my health for my help come from the lord the need the heavens and earth father i ask you lord to look upon this family today i'll say felicia the son today [Music] the mother today father i pray for this family you would comfort them and strengthen them well father you said in your words that we can cast our cares upon you because you care because you care lord we can lay down our burdens knowing that you are carrying our dirt i asked you today [Music] lord just let them cast all that cares upon you thank you for doing the lord bless me bless this family in jesus christ's name amen brother derek like to dance a little in the spirit and uh it would be something if we don't dance a little while but you know we got all of these people that have to work up a shout out dance for the lord but if the spirit was right brother darren would just get out in the aisle and he'd start dancing for the lord he didn't mind that he was always encouraging pastor i i really enjoyed that message and uh he wasn't about any foolishness didn't want to hear even if we thought it was important he said he wasn't about that and it was good that he wasn't about foolishness he likes to keep his peace and he wanted to be able to get along with everybody so we can reflect on many things about brother darren when i heard about brother david it came to me a man of faith and a man of prayer we call prayer meeting brother jarrett you all know men don't like to pray too much it's called for the praying women of the church but that brother jarrett he gonna be there if you're gonna pray it doesn't matter how he felt he wanted to be in prayer meeting faith i noticed a sister brought up about him his eyes getting but you couldn't tell brother derek that he wasn't 20 20 or 2013. see because he wasn't going to speak negative even though he was going through it within himself but he wasn't going to speak it on himself if the doctor said your heart is you know this and that he said doc my heart is i'm well why he was speaking that with his stripes i'm here no matter what the x-rays said or what the doctor said with the stripes i'm here i believe that because the word said it and you're going to you're wasting your time trying to talk him out of it because he believed when when the covert came and i said gary you know we don't want the ones that got conditioned kind of sick you know to come in we're going to let some of the people come back and you know with the face mask and everything he said but pastor i'm here i said okay there you hear i said well you know the best thing for me to do just hold all of y'all up you know let's wait till because you weren't going to stop derrick from coming to church brother derrick was healed and i said you'll never take that away from an individual he spoke faith in the midst of any condition he spoke faith and many times i think that the average person would have been taken out if they would have looked at what the doctors and what the reports had said but derrick kept on getting up he kept on amen when it looked like all hope is lost there and still have faith he got up y'all might say darry oh you know you shouldn't be working this huh i'm just as well as anybody else and you couldn't keep them away because he loved mentoring he loved us you know the young people and he loved to try to help folk and he you know not that was his life if he couldn't do that i mean he just might as well be gone he he just loved doing that so by the grace of god i could say a lot of things let me get in give a few words to a family and and we can't i guess everybody just loved derrick and i mean we all did here and we appreciate it i know he loved the bishop family and uh pastor bishop i knew he loved y'all amen you oftentimes appreciate what y'all did and what your dad did in his life amen and so by the grace of god we want to go to revelation 21 for a few moments and just speak to you a little bit but uh you know you know i'm excited because i i would like to shout a little while but uh y'all y'all feel all right in all things give thanks god is good in spite of amen praise god i woke up this morning with my mind it's dead on jesus revelation 21 he says and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and first earth was passed away and there were no more sea and i john saw a holy city a new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride are done for her husband amen thank god for the bride amen the bride amen a dawn for her husband praise god and i heard a great voice from heaven saying behold the tabernacle god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the form of things have passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are faithful and true i skip down to the eighth verse and it says but the fear for and the unbelieving and the abominable and the myrtles and the whole mongers and the sorcerers and the idolaters and all liars shall have their part in a lake which burn with fire and brimstone which is the second death i would have talked talked to you a little bit this morning i mean this afternoon about heaven but there is a contrast there's something that uh we got to consider there is a heaven and there is a hell heaven or hell it might not encourage you to really know that their hell does exist in heaven exists the question in the young and talented mind today is and there's been debates that a loving god and a creator as we know god would not have a thing such thing that caused hell and that there would be no such thing that as we've read uh uh concerning the lake of fire but i want to talk about heaven for a little while heaven or hell i want to ask the question do you think that is real is heaven real and vice versa is hell really real isn't it is that such thing as an existence of a hell is it really real the reality in the the mind as we begin to reason and begin to think is there a heaven or is there hell see the bible talks about eternal life god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life jesus said if a man live and believe in me he should never die yet we see he look like people are dying all the time but when jesus talked about ladarius and martha said i know i see my brother again in the resurrection in the last day he said now amen i want to tell you that i am the resurrection i am the life he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die are you with me so when the disciples saw uh uh was with jesus before he went down to martha and mary he said my our friend ladder sleep sleeping and they said to jesus if he's sleep he'd do it well he said now i want to make it clear to you he is dead but i am going to wake him up amen i believe the day amen as we consider for a little salt topping paul says to me to live is christ and to die is gain are you with me amen to live is christ and to die is gain hallelujah i believe that amanda as uh uh brother their son said daddy made changes and i could see it and now it's something about amen when god begins to transform amen a life that's been deformed by the devil but god got the power to transform hallelujah i'm so glad for the power of transformation that god could take a wretched center like you and i and god can transform a life oh is it a heaven or is it a hell sometimes the way we conduct our lives we believe that we're living in yeah mm-hmm yeah and sometimes the way we conduct our lives amen you said this is like uh-huh it's like i can say that it's like heaven to me am i right sometimes we we we we can understand when when christ comes into our lives the joy and the peace that he gives hallelujah no drugs no alcohol no can i say no woman no man no nothing like jesus amen and somebody said can't nobody do me like jesus can't nobody do me like the lord amen don't worry brother sister friend amen you can live in a dimensional and in a position amen that you're going through suffering and pain and agony amen praise god but you can live in a world they meant that your pain and your suffering amen become the joy amen because i heard him said counted all joy when you're falling into the divorce temptation knowing they meant that the trine of your faith amen it'll work patience amen i'm glad to tell you it doesn't matter what we go through amen i heard paul said well i'll let nothing separate me from the love of god that i found in christ i know that he's good anyhow though i walk through the valley of the shadows of death he said i'll fear no evil because thou art with me for thy riot and my staff they coughing me i'm all right anyhow hey god oh lord i'm all right let me pause for a moment we viewed a body amen that came by sex desire amen but we didn't see the real derrick we saw an image and a likeness but we didn't see the real derrick but the real jared was the transformed man christ that was in derrick they meant jesus amen had put his seed down inside of darren amen for this is a corruptible body but god promised an incorruptible body amen he said if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved god has got a building not made with hand eternal in the heavens are you with me so the real terry that you see laying there his hope was not in this life his hope was in amen god has given me eternal life amen and i can't die amen he might even act a little strange but i can't die i got something worth living for amen eternal life oftentimes i said eternal life is like a circle amen it has no beginning and no end praise god if you look back through our genealogy and oftentimes they go to family reunions amen i think uh brother bishop my mom was looking back and she found out that it meant that we were cousins and then uh sometimes we look through our genealogy and we're proud that i come from ghana and you come from this and amen but i can look farther back in than africa and see where i came from and that's what darren amen he had an opportunity to look back and see who was his real father and where he came from they met praise god and to be a son or daughter of god i'm talking about if your son a daughter of god then somewhere along the line amen in order for me to be a simmons uh amen before i ever knew i was a simon the amen i was in the lungs of my father david amen but i didn't know that i existed in islam but there was a gene seed that was down in my father that was in his father he meant that brought me forth in the appointed time and i want to tell you something uh about brother derek amen it's before the foundation of the world amen god can look and uh in order for him to amen to be a son of god now that means he was a son of god in the eternity before the stars before the foundation of the world god had found new him god knew his name god knew his troubles but god knew that one day amen amen he was going to hear the gospel hear the word of the lord and when he heard there was something down in his side amen does quicken him and said i can recognize amen that's the voice in that of my god amen my father called me amen i hired him call come unto me oh you believe him and have it laid i'll give you a rest oh brother i don't know what you're going through sir amen but i want you to hear the voice of god that voice called you it speaks from eternity it speaks to your soul amen and identifies you with jesus christ and what the blood was shattered for oh the purpose of calvary they meant the lamb was already slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world why was the lamb slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world he was slain because the lord saw you and i there and it was worth him coming down in the flesh to identify amen what was in his mind god took it from mine from thought to word and from word to flesh and to die on the cross he said i came from god and i go back to god brother darren amen amen recognize that his name was on the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world and god put it there because he foreknew him and saw him there i wonder can you see your name hallelujah i could not keep from coming to the lord why because i know my father was called my sheep know my voice when he said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy
