isaiah 14 and 12 through 16 i'll read the first you read the next we read the 16 together hallelujah it's just good to be in the house of the lord amen praise god so much is happening so fast and the world look like it's rapidly the sixth vision and the seventh vision that the prophet saw boom we're right here could be through the third wall and the third world war and all breaks out and where are we california's sinking japan just had a seven point everything is just shaking all over yet the people seemed like they're still asleep we gotta wake up brother sister 14 and 12 it says see how are thou falling from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how the cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation 13. and i will ascend above the height of the cloud and i will be like the most high fifteen together they that see thee should narrowly look upon thee and considerably saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble and that did shake kingdoms and god bless you read the word you may be seated as i was in prayer yesterday praying that god would just give us something for the people of god and not only did he give us something for you all but he gave us something for me amen so he said the husband must be first partaker of the fruit amen and the prophet god spoke a message on humble yourselves we want to talk this morning and it really made me re-examine myself humble yourself and i want you to look at the spirit of this age the last stage of spirit of the last days you know i i would consider the spirit of the last days to be the sub-topic this morning in the spirit of the last days and as we look at the spirit of the last days and looking at lucifer uh how he reacted and and what was he what was he all about i believe the characteristics of lucifer would describe the characteristics of the spirit of the last days are you with me and people subconsciously uh just don't care whether the spirit of lucifer as i told about the young man that was calling on lucifer forming that the mouth had lost it all and god healed them and delivered him from the spirit of lucifer lucifer is just as real as jesus christ and that young man was delivered and it was a sight to see because people saw somebody that was so demon possessed that they were calling on lucifer in the midst of the church are you with me but god is faithful amen but because we think that lucifer don't exist and the very individuals that think that lucifer don't exist may be possessed with the spirit of lucifer and not even know it you know the prophet of god said you know spirit of a lust spirit different spirits that he cast out of uh mary magdalene had seven demons are you with me and so some sometimes if people are carrying spirits that they are not conscious of amen and you're taking baggage that you don't even know so it behooves us to examine ourselves and look at ourselves and and and um just before i came up i wrote something down that's room for improvement i'm talking about for me that i can be more humble i mean sometimes we think that you know we reach the pinnacle and that we have it but god sometimes he's he just nudging said hey you can't be more humble see sometimes we don't know what kind of spirit sometimes we're carrying and sometimes our attitude is not where it needs to be and oftentimes those flaws in our lives those faults god want to correct but we got to be knowledgeable amen that we need correction in our spirit so as we examine lucifer he said how's that falling and you know i was in prayer and i was i i i wish i had my pen there but as i was in prayer this morning for full service and not on my knees and usually i have my my pen there so because god started talking i started writing i tried to get up and try to write some of the stuff things down and um probably left it back there what i wrote down but anyway it was dealing with um i will and god's will you know what i'm saying lucifer talk about what i would do and most of us got that spirit i will you know subconsciously you got a spirit that yes you you know i will i'm going to do this i'm going to do that and i will and we we almost don't even put god in the plan as though he don't exist it's almost like lucifer said i'm going to exalt my throne and see in our minds we're going to exalt ourselves lucifer had the self-image that he's going to exalt himself and so often times we're worried about exalting self how can i exalt myself and that's what god wants to get rid of our pride and wants us to be conscious of self-exaltation exalting ourselves that we can lift ourselves up above the stars you know god had seven stars in his hand are you with me and that was the seven messages to the seven church ages but we can exalt our throne above the stars of god are you with me oftentimes we exalt ourselves subconsciously and not really knowing what we're doing but because the spirit of pride is gonna on us because we have a spirit of pride then we exalt ourselves i'm not used to teaching i'm used to preaching on sunday morning but y'all bear with me are you with me let let me go to the spirit of the uh last days and see the spirit of lucifer and see whether it parallel with the spirit that anoints uh folks in the last days it would be the same spirit that had known that lucifer when he was in heaven the spirit of this age are you with me so in second timothy 3 and 1 he said let's know also that in the last days dangerous or perilous times should come and i tell you anything could be any dangerous is than these earthquakes and you know even ryan colombia and ron elgin it hadn't stopped earthquakes all the time japan and all of that and the threat of the third world war nuclear war nobody wants it nobody wants nuclear war the whole world don't want it but we're right there at you know and i said lord you held back the four winds and and you said to the servants of god sealed in the forehead and i said god you know he's holding back the third world in the nuclear war but and to the servants of god to god conceal somebody amen to somebody can get all the way in and all the way right like they should god is holding back the four winds are you with me and i'm glad that god held it back for me and if you're not right with god you ought to know god's mercy it's with you and he's given you opportunity to be sealed but it's up to you if you want to be sealed or not but you know that god's elect amen they want it now see we don't want to deal with ourselves sometimes oftentimes we don't want to deal with ourselves he said dangerous or prayerless time should come for men shall be what it's all about what we want we love ourselves it's what we want it's all about what i want i want this i want that and i'm going to beat this up it's all about your god in it you know it doesn't make no difference with god you know i want this i want that and just you know just ignore the god don't even exist and like they don't think the lucifer exists either they don't think the devil exists and they don't think god exists and what are you thinking or not there's a right and there's a room are you with me if there was no right or wrong then i can understand that's good and that's evil whether you want to face it or not it exists are you with me this day and there's night are you with me and nothing you can do about it amen but amen as you look at your life you know are you children of the day or your children of the night of your children of the night then you are going to do like the creatures that come out in the night after i'll try to operate in the daytime and the blinding because he's a night creature are you with me and so if you are the night then you don't want delight are you with me because the light is for the children of the thing are you with me but the children of the night they hate the light are you with me because it's blinds and brother fred so they don't like the light because their children are tonight oh lord ain't god good that shall be light in the evening time that's why god sent light for us for you and i isn't that right that we might see how to operate in such a gross dark age amen but god opened up the seals and opened the word that we can see in this dark day are you a man so here we are he says for men should be lovers of their own cells that's our problem that's that's how we're hung up on self we're so in tune to ourselves i've seen mothers this isn't happening lately i don't know what's going on with the system but it's been harming but uh by the grace of god we're so in tune to self can y'all hear me all right we're so into in the self and um because of uh uh uh uh of self i see mothers pursue because they want the pledges of sin and they let the children oh they'll walk away from home and they'll leave their children i've seen the fathers not want to provide for the children so it's a dreadful day that we live in because people want to go after their own dreams the imagination of their own hearts they want to do their thing so they're for some they forsake the thing that they're supposed to be doing oh god people don't okay say he says lovers of their own self covers this everything is dealing with lucifer coverages okay bolsters people brag so much bolsters proud blasphemers they don't mind blaspheming they're jesus or god and i don't believe in god i don't believe it no no bible i don't believe in nothing i believe in myself young people are gone they are very rude and very arrogant like they think there's something when they're nothing maybe i get ahead of myself uh where caleb is okay josh get me psalms 100 and 5. psalms 105. praise god see oftentimes we're so arrogant and so a lot of times we we leave off the things of god because just pick up the third verse the third verse josh get it you got it you're gonna give it to caleb i don't know maybe that i said maybe that's what was neat the third verse i mean third verse go ahead on cop to kill him 103. you got it up there oh no okay go ahead we all right everybody all right i'm going too slow okay so by the grace of god i want you to see some things i want you to see what god was speaking to me and i began to look at my walk with god everything is real my walk with god and i began to reassess my walk with god and i asked god for help because i want to be more humble so i asked god to help me help me bring self under subjection to your word help me to humble myself but i cannot do it except i know that i need more humility except i understand i need more humility because sometimes we walk as though we've already attained or we already have it when god says you need more grace are you with me go ahead on killer psalms 103 know ye that the lord he is god it is he that has made us and not we ourselves we don't want to hear that we don't want to hear that we think that we're here because i don't know i don't know where they ever thought it in their mind they think that i exist because of my existence they're not there's no respect for parents are you with me because they don't want you know when they couldn't take care of themselves when they were babies and you had to feed them you had to do everything for them they got no respect they're not grateful they're not thankful for nothing are you with me you give them giving them a little money and a little education and they think they something and sometimes they think that you have to do what you do for them they're stuffing their rebellious the young people today see their place in a in a world where they're being anointed with the spirit that lucifer had and because of their being with the lucifer tight spirit that anoints this age that we live in the last day spirit will be a such a proud and boastful spirit go ahead it says here blasphemers disobedient to what on what oh excuse me go go no go on over there know you that that the lord hears god go i'm i'm i'm over there back and feed them i mean uh timothy but go ahead on going on we are his people in the sheep of his pastor go ahead enter this gates with thanksgiving that's why he says you ought to praise him because you know he made you and that's why you ought to praise him are you open that's why you ought to be thankful the attitude you ought to be giving god thanks do you think so folks come to church today thankful that god give him another day to live another opportunity to praise him folks don't even want to go to church no more because they think that i can go on and i can live my life and as dole amen i woke myself up this morning they don't want to acknowledge god at all but you see what i'm saying is something that blocks the hearing he said he that has an ear to hear let him what what the spirit has to say to the what church just lay out the ca but if you don't have an ear you don't have the holy ghost you don't have the spirit of god you actually cannot hear you can sit here this morning and everything your ears are dull of understanding here amen it's though that you you you cannot you listen but you can't hear in other words amen you cannot even see you cannot understand the kingdom of god because there's something in you that don't want it it's something in you that i don't want god i don't need god and i don't want him but there's a deep call into the deep there's something that's hungry and thirsting for god and that is the soul that needs god and wants god but you don't want the soul to have it because of your own selfishness are you with me because you're so in tune with self that you don't want to get in tune with god for there's a thirst in every man there's a thirst for god but we don't want to give god what what the soul is hungering and thirsting for we don't want to give it yes we give it some a joint some alcohol some fornication adultery and all of that stuff but we don't want to give it god the soul wants god the living god amen david said my soul threatens for the living god i'm on god the prophet god spoke that message thirst amen and and that's a thirst for god it's a thirst but you got to answer the call of god for your life you got to know that god wants to bless you but the devil will block you he'll do everything he can do to block the blessings to not let god but lessons be restored upon your life the devil will do everything to hinder that from happening lucifer job is okay we'll get to that go ahead on reading now i got to i got to go back here and i got to move faster because i'm way behind into into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endure to all generations lord is good amen i serve a good god i don't i oh i serve him because i love him because he's good to me hallelujah he's a good god hallelujah oh some folks don't want him but i i love him i appreciate the lord amen you know let me go back here to a second timothy here and and i'm gonna try to give you some of the things i know i don't have time to give you everything but uh just some highlights on some of the things god was dealing with me on and and makes me reject he says in the second verse again men should be lovers of their own selves covetousness boasts described blasphemous disobedience to parents unthankful and unholy without natural what that's the spirit of the last days are you with me women want to be men men want to be look at these little girls these little girls want to dress themselves like they super women they don't get a chance to enjoy being a little child 10 or 12 years old they're looking like a woman they're dressing like a woman it used to be a time to get some plaques in their hair and look like a little girl they're acting like a woman they're getting grown for conversation are you with me used to be a time it was a difference they grow up before their time are you with me i would to god that these young people get a chance to be young and happy and children they can play you know and act like you know act like they're 10 and 11 12 and 13. instead of that they're shooting one another johnny gaines and killing one another and all of that stuff growing up selling drugs and all kind of craziness are you with me living in a dangerous time and yet our children are being wooed and pulled and they want to go that way they want to look like a thug am i right they want to look like the world act like the world and be like the world and they think it's cool all tattooed up it ring it rings in the air it rings in the nose it rings on the feet it right boy when they look at some folk you look like something that come out of the pits of hell are you with me but they looked in the mirror and they see oh they cool they think lord have mercy god is good isn't that right god trying to save us from some of that stuff that exists only in hell are you with me and god wants you to be in the kingdom of god and trying to keep us away from those things but the devil is wounding and pulling you and god tell you ugly look beautiful and godliness is ugly being holy and godly is ugly but beautiful is oh god some of this oh god you can't see how people look like that and can face themselves but yet the more the devil pull you you start looking like where you're going where you're headed you start looking like where you're headed are you with me so when you get there you don't have to change the only thing different is you won't like it you didn't know you was dressed and you were preparing for it we're preparing to go to heaven and when we stand before god we want to be holy are you with me when you appear before him you want to say god he you well please he looked at you you say you look holy you're sanctified that god bless you brother come on in as i said in north carolina the other day i said you know he says i consider you to buy me gold tried in the fire and white ramen that you might be closed and that the shame of your necklace does not appear are you hoofing i want you to put on some are you but people can stand before god in the shame of their nakedness and god this is what i present to you this is what i'm giving you god how are you going to stand before god in in the shape that you're in and dress like because of pride cain would not repent though god gave him opportunity to repent he refused to repent neither would this generation repent this generation is rebellious they're so into self they said it god i don't want to say what i i hear in my ears and i don't know who's saying that but it don't sound good to my ears what this generation is saying amen that they don't mind going to hell and so they're ascending in a such a dangerous way they're saying to god the way with you i'm hearing them saying in my ears i heard it hollered out as for god oh lord and i feel sorry for the soul that i heard said that because you're going to need that god that you rejected amen they said it in a way that they were cursing god amen the bible said they would do it they said to the rocks in my they cursed god when god judged me because they started falling on them they'll start cursing god instead of repenting and that's what's going on people are cursing god instead of repenting the bible says in the fourth verse the traitors heady got the big head hard here big head heady what y'all ever seen anybody like that look at somebody asking you ever seen anybody like that i guess you ain't got to look for are you with me heady high minded what y'all don't think god can give you what you need and you can have joy and happiness serving god but you know the devil has told you that i got more to offer you love was a pleasure more than lovers of god lord have mercy this what he says heaven and what having a form of god is folklore the church and got a form of godliness but then what y'all said they deny the power amen they don't want the holy ghost in the church they don't want signs and oneness they don't want miracles they don't want the gifts of the spirit operating they don't want to see god they don't want the power of god they deny the power thereof amen it's all right if the prophet did it back in the day but what about now what about you and i are you with me do you want god to operate in your life oh god lord have mercy isaiah 3 and 16. isaiah 3 16. you got to kill go ahead oh moreover the lord said because the daughters of zion are what hearty are y'all understanding what i'm saying because the daughters of zion are hearty what read them and walk with stretch forth and necks and wanting eyes walking and mincing as they go that's the big highest shoes they walk you got to make a noise with the highest shoes mixing as it go you got to walk a certain way you got to move a certain way when you got to hide his shoes on it make you walk a certain way that's why you got to watch how high you got those shoes and they make you and the men know you want folks to watch and see oh you're with me that's what it's all about are you with me go ahead they're making a tinkling with their feet oh yeah don't come you know here okay so nobody told you oh yeah somebody told you be careful sister brother the prophet god said it's calling that vision i mean that dream his mama had and they said i'll show you i'm gonna walk the highway the straight narrow highway with these shoes on and said the lady fell in hell she couldn't walk up that straight narrow way are you with me so i'm gonna i'm gonna say brother and sister you're gonna have to line up with the word but because we would not humble ourselves we don't care i don't see nothing wrong with it i do what i want oh what is that i feel this is what i want to do but jesus said not what my will it's the will of god and but lucifer i will exalt my throne yes i'm going to lift myself up are you with me so we're so into it that we don't know that we're actually fighting against the word and we're coming against god in our action and our attitude are you up there go ahead therefore the lord will smite with the scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion and the lord will discover their secret partners in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cold way they want to put stuff going and they're round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers the bonnets and the ornaments of the leg and the head pins and the tablets and the earrings the rings and those jewelry jewels that's why you know when god takes stuff away people want to do it because god said i'm going to take it away so people do it just to be rebellious against god i'ma do and show you god you told me what the women should have dawned themselves and in modest parents with shame faces and sobriety and not with broader hair gold pearl or costly ray well you told us how to conduct our lives but you know you know i'm gonna do what i i feel like men you know men too you know we want to do what we look at god said a woman hair she had long hair is full of glory isn't that right but it's a shame for a man to have long hair you know what happens we reverse it we let the man have the long hair and the women cut off like yeah are you with me because why we're rebelling against god the spirit of the last day is to rebel against god so the men has long and the women have shot cut it off the woman want to look like the man and the man want to look like what's the woman it's the rebellion against the scripture so i'm gonna show god and that's what the spirit of it's the anointing of lucifer on the people the spirit of lucifer on the people that have a proud and a lifted up spirit that they're going to lift themselves up above the word god i'll tell you let's go to um first peter 5. it verse 3 to 5. i i've been dealing with some things i see things in me that i don't like the reason why i don't like them because god said amen i'm looking for more improvement in your life as a minister uh you know i in this first peter 5 it talks about the shepherd and the one to feed the flock he talked about the elders among you i exhaust amen which is also an elder and of the son a witness of the suffering of christ i don't find many want to suffer for christ and so peter was talking about i want to i want to be a example of the suffering of christ and because sometimes we don't as examples to the flaw of the suffering suffering of christ so make you re come back and reexamine as a as under shepherd to the sheep jefford that when you know look at jesus how he carried himself are you carrying yourself and your walk the same way you can't expect of the people what you're not expecting of yourself are you with me for the husband must be first partaker of the fruit so if you're asking the people to be more humble then you got to become more humble are you with me so uh and i said god help me amen help me to examine and see who i am that i can present a better example to the flock are you with me so no it doesn't matter you know when the word when god speak to you amen you say yes lord but it takes the grace of god can help you to maintain what he said amen so he you you got me in the first i mean first street of five it says uh in five let's look there because i i don't want to read all of that okay likewise what you're younger what younger submit yourself unto the elders yay all of you it used to be any elder any grown-up children were to give respect to and they said something to them you got some of these little small children who won't even listen to adult at all why because it's the spirit of this age are you with me they won't listen to the teacher in school they won't listen to you know what the folks say if they won't listen now you know the road up ahead where they'll be are you with me they either be dead are they in prison are you with me so it's better to listen and to the elders as they try to train you and try to tell you listen to your parents listen to what they say and hear what they got to say instead of playing games while you're in church and got a telephone you got to throw that telephone in the garbage why are you with me you see why why the devil will blind certain people you let them instead of listening to the word they can't even hear the word for what they're doing okay go ahead and read yeah all of you be subject one one to another and be close with humility each one got to be subject one to another all of us he didn't say he didn't leave the preacher out he said all of you are you with me subject one to another okay go right here and be clothed with humility that's what i say he said be clothed with humility clothe with it go ahead but god resists the prowl and giveth grace to the humble and see if we want more grace if we want the grace of god he gives it to who the humble go ahead humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exhaust he says to you as individuals to what not that god's going to humble you he said for you to what you to do it humble yourself in in every aspect of our lives it's areas that we need correction in you know what i'm saying it may not be what god what i need correction in it may not be the area you need correction in but we all can stand some correction god can help us all be better and that's what the word of god if god wants to make us better christians that we might be prepared to meet him when he called you got to be willing to answer his calling okay so read on humble yourselves he says go therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time now lucifer had the attitude i would exalt what i was up my throne see i i'm exalt my throne he had the attitude i'mma exalt mine and you know when god gives you a gift of talent the bible said a man gift will make what sometimes we god gives us a gift and we make room for ourselves and if god allows your gift to be overlooked then thank god that he allows it for a purpose somebody says uh uh folks having not acknowledged my gift the things that i do in the kingdom of god it's not being appreciated who gonna appreciate it who you want to appreciate who you want to praise you we all get into the attitude sometimes that who cares about you who cares about me we get a little self-pity you know all of us you know everybody comes to those places that uh elijah he's under his juniper he said lord you they don't kill all the prophets and i'm here alone by myself god said i got 7 000 had not battled are you with me so we all get a little you know uh in places in in our lives that we feel like amen we need to have a little uh uh conference with god a little pity party you know because we want to be appreciated and respected are you with me but sometimes god allows certain things to happen in our walk and in our lives amen that he's working humility and it is in the time opponent god will lift you up yes god has an appointed time that he's going to do for you amen now now i'm going to tell you something when we want it so bad that it hurts so bad then god is saying let it hurt some more are you with me because it's hurting who it's not hurting god it's hurting you and god is trying to get rid of you because you're not ready for what you want until it don't hurt no more amen what you think you want you're not ready for it where you think you ought to be you're not there but there are others that's going to exalt you are you with me there are those that will exalt you and lift you up and make you feel like you are important you got the vip treatment are you with me i find in most ministers they're worried about their ministry their their self image where they want to go where they want to be they want to be great and i wanted the call of god that god really called them because they want to be famous they want to be great ministers they think of themselves more highly than they ought to think and people want to follow people that they believe that are great the crowds the multitudes follow the great preachers but the humble they don't want that that's why the crowds packed the billy grahams and all rivals and then the prophet you know though god was using it mightily yet he was you know i i i want to show you something that hit my hit my heart really heavy this morning um isaiah uh 53. it really worked with me and i says god you know i just i i'm gonna close after this the lord's willing but because i i can't get where i want to go but i'm gonna close in a minute it says at 50 53 and 10. and i hope you take a picture of what jesus had to go through for you and i and understand that the way up is the way down the god will take you down before he raises you up david went through a lot of disappointment in denial and rejection before god put him on the throne joseph went through a lot of denial and rejection and before he was put on the throne and god wants to exalt you but god cannot exalt you if you exalt yourself if you're so interested in who you are and what you want to be then god can never make you what he wants you to be because you've already had an image in your mind of where you want to go and what you want to be you want to be successful you want to be great you want to be somebody that's to respect it but i'ma say the world love is on you'll be despised and rejected amen go ahead um um i said 53 and 10 please yet it pleased the lord to bruise him you know i looked at that yet it pleased the lord to it please the lord to what do you understand yet it pleased the lord to bruise him go ahead he have put him to greed he had put him to grief go ahead when thou shalt make his soul offering for sin but that's what it's all about god shall make his soul an offering for sin he that knew no sin was made sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of god in him go ahead read on he shall see his seed he should see his seed what he was going through he wasn't going through for himself he was going through that for us he should see his seed go ahead he shall prolong his days yes and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hands go ahead he shall see of the travail of his soul and shalt be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many god god it please him it please god to let jesus go through what he went through are you with me and yet you said you know he said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased the bible said you know amen without our walk is with god like enough before his before he was translated he had a testimony that he what please god brother and sister our pleasing god is a is a road of suffering but it's a road of humility when we can get out the way and let god jesus said not my will but lucifer i will i will exalt my throne the bible says amen let this mind be in your philippians 2 it's also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be what eagle with the god was made of himself no reputation we made of himself the form of a servant amen god amen actually humbled himself and he suffered amen and he said wherefore god has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name are you with me when you when you after you suffered a while i wish i can get to some places that i would like to get there you know but the thing is we try to bypass our suffering part we try to go around it amen but we don't this is not play play church this is not just trying to tell you something to make you feel good this is a way that god even walked us walk and he lived that kind of life and he wants you to be particulars of his suffering amen god wants you to walk that wall amen he told brother brown because you're chosen the hard way but this is my way that's what he chose he didn't choose the easel because you chose he could have uh took those all that money to people trying to give he didn't do it are you with me you know you look at you look at people and the choices people make they try to get around the suffering part and what folks will think about them and sell bottom they try to get around that they don't want the suffering behind people want to be men pleasers they want to please themselves not god how you going to get around it brother sis did you finish go ahead but he shall bear their iniquities that's what it's all about battling he should bear their iniquities and god he did that for us but what are you doing i'm going to tell you something we don't want to deal with our our person our personality because we've been that way so long and we've been saved so long and you know some people you know even when they talk they talk mean they don't have a humble you know i always tell people my attraction to the message of the owl is because i saw a humble prophet he wasn't trying to send everybody to hell and blasting everybody and that his gift was so you know it was a humble person and then i re-examined myself and you know it was it was showing us a humility that should be we we just can't look at the prophet and say oh he was a humble man what about you and i what's our humility look at jesus what he did the ones that spit on him and lied on him and whipped him and beat him and yet he was dying for them brother you know how do we feel sometimes when we're taking advantage of how do we feel sometimes when you know sometimes we have the wrong pers perception of others because we're so busy looking at their faults that we can't see our home because if we really looked in the mirror we'll see so much that we can't even see others because we see so much in us that we need working home you know to others won't matter no more because god i i need to get this house in order lord i need to get my life you know help me to humble myself oh god i want to do your will i want to please you lord that's what i want god that's what i want i want to please god praise god amen forget about yourself amen it's better our knickers is therefore will i divide him a portion with the great that's what happens because of what he done because of what went on with jesus amen therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with just what strong because he has what he's pulled out his soul unto death he was numbered with the what transgressors and he bear the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors are you with me usually we read isaiah 53 and five he was one of the five transgressions boots right nick just you know with the strikes we heal and so forth but the latter part it rained to me this morning it really meant something and i wish i could just break the whole message down and just really spend time and just telling you more but by the grace of god time what fails but i i wish you could penetrate i wish you could re-examine your life and say god where's my humility why are you calling us to humility forget about all this the bible says christ forgave you forgive one another are you with me walk in love are you with me love one another are you with me take advantage of the word this morning be partakers of this world this morning and walk in humility are you with me when you leave here don't walk with the uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh a complaint in your spirit or an an imagination that would not profit you but lord help me to see that i need to be more humble i want it as we stand this morning what about you friend sister brother the bible says the captain of our salvation was made perfect through suffering and i believe god wants to make you perfect for he says be perfect as your father which is in heaven after you suffered a while then he strengthened you established you amen he went on to say he'll make you perfect praise god god wants to make you perfect but your perfection come through suffering are you with me but if you get around suffering how can you be perfected how can you be made perfect if you don't want to suffer somebody says well i i'm not going to do it praise god wherefore god has highly exalted him and giving him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus christ every knee shall bow and every tongue should confess to jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father one day you'll confess [Music] that he's the lord and you want to say lord have mercy have mercy on my soul have mercy in my life as our his about hearts are looking to him is there room for improvement can i be more humble do you want to be more humble is there one this morning that will lift your hand so lord help me because i want to surrender to you and i want to walk in humility he was led as a sheep to the slaughter lord lead me lord help me oh god to be a sheep and to be led to the slaughter oh god help me jesus oh god they're following your footsteps lord as you oh god walk this walk this last day bride she'll walk hallelujah in step with your word oh god the end time word for the hour that we live in she'll walk in thus said the lord oh god man happened today may the blood of jesus oh god cover your children today god may you pour your your spirit lord god in these vessels lord god that willing to walk humbly before you oh god not our will but let your will be done in our lives for here we are lord thank you for where you lead i will follow oh yes we want to follow you lord forgive us lord and help us jesus in jesus name we're here this morning god we thank you thank you today thank you o god for a serious savior that's left all that he had to come down in flesh and to die on the cross oh god he became so low that he even went down in hell itself oh god now he's lifted up with all power and heaven in the nerve i thank you now i thank you hallelujah i want to be identified with him not only in his suffering but in his resurrection thank you lord thank you lord amen i want to say amen thank you lord you're not repented of your sins been baptized in water in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sin then this morning the opportunity is yours now we can walk in our pride or we can humble ourselves it's up to us not to me not to brother simmons but in the sight of the lord he said humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he will exalt you are you a man so it's not in the sight of men but it's inside humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he will lift you up but god resists the proud but he gives what you give grace to the what humble so brother and sister the bible is calling you to repentance he's calling you he's calling me he's calling each and every one of us to repent of our sins be baptized in water in the name of jesus christ it's up to us whether or not we obey him or not god bless you this morning i want to say time is winding up die was late it's later than we think so you're gonna run you better run now it wasn't a shouting message this morning but it was a message that we all can examine ourselves see where we stand see can we be more kind more tender hearted more compassion are you with me but you can only be what you ordained to be are you open but i believe that the purpose of the word comes to penetrate the hardness of heart and to soften our hearts up as the brother sings and plays if you're here this morning you want prayer you could come and god is good amen i don't want to rush out of here and not give a person opportunity we how many want to do better i want to do better i want to be more compassionate more understanding and more humble are you with me y'all look at me amen if you see something let me know are you with me because i want to i want to be more humble amen if god spoke to me and he talked to me i want to walk it not just talking not just preaching but walking [Music] do it for me [Music] oh yeah do it for me and do it for me [Music] oh [Music] do oh do it for me oh yes lord [Music] we want you to do it do it for me [Music] me [Music] bye me [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen [Music] let's give the lord a handcuff please [Applause] [Music] thank you lord let's bow our heads lord jesus we thank you for your word this morning lord may your word saturate our souls lord and may you may we continue to give you all the praise and glory and honor lord for thy word this morning pray the lord you grant to us traveling mercies as we travel to our predesignated destinations and lord continue to bless us and keep us and keep us humble before thy face forevermore in jesus christ's name we thank you for all things amen [Music] [Music] you
