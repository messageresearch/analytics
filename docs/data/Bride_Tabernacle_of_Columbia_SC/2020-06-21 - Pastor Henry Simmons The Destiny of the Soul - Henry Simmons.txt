needs you know the conditions while the actual bar get you he'll save and deliver for we're trusting God fan and word apprise knowing that what you promised labor to performance for we look to you now in Jesus name Amen the book of [Music] is equal 18 The Book of Ezekiel 18 and reach the word of the Lord came to me again saying what mean ye that you use this proverbs concerning the land of Israel saying the father have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge as I live saith the Lord God you shall not have an occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel behold all souls are mine the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die the subject matter this morning the destiny of the soul judge where is the soul headed the destiny of the soul so top it thus mourn and being there for death began you may be seated appreciate everyone the destiny of the soul before death began sometimes there are many definitions that they give concerning what solely but we understand in Genesis 1 when God created man he created him in his own image and it's all lockness male and female created he them what happened was that man was spirit man with God created Adam Eve was hidden inside of Adam but they were spirit did as his to tell us the God formed man from the dust of the ground and then we hear that when he formed him of the dust of the ground he breathed in his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul so man became a living soul we are told the difference between the animal world and man the animal have flesh and blood and it had the spirit but man has a soul soul sometimes we would look deep within and say what is my soul what is the destiny of my soul what we understand that Word of God tells us this morning you is the house that the soul lives in and because of the body MANET seemed to be more interested and is exterior than interior but you must be concerned about the destiny of your soul when God told magnet and the tree of the garden you may freely eat but the tree of knowledge of good and evil for the day you eat land made a decision and was influenced by the serpent as it is today the Supplemental serpent called the devil has influenced mankind to death he calls Eve took out one word and because of her doubted one way deaf Keamy Bible tells us that the soul that sinneth shall die so days a destiny a destination that Santa comes in - and what was the sin of unbelief that he doubted what God see and believe what the devil told her how many today believe in 9 the cup from the devil instead of trusted what the way has sat us friends of mine sometimes man don't want to believe the Word of God and that death is real conduct he meant it as much as death is real I like for you to look with me today in Hebrews 9 the reality amen of the destiny of the soul for Hebrews 9 begins to tell us that we have an appointment ebrill 9 in 27 it says that it is important appointed to men once to die but after this the judgment mine comes to an apartment that everyone that forward of a woman has to come to me and a pony time is an appointment supported the man once to die and after you die no judgment towards me is coming for each and every one of us too small may not be a sound message but I want you to hear that you are returning and you're going somewhere and where are you going determines that is Satan that you make so I would to God that the inside of a woman when she's pregnant she had a craving for sadness type of food that the baby inside of her is craving for so why she's pregnant my wife she wanted t-bone steak and it was just about every day I found myself going and buying her a t-bone but it wasn't that she wanted the people it was the craving that the baby that she was carrying on the inside my son wanted a t-bone is from the each side that you sold is craving five even God the soul has a desire I want to say after my wife after my son was born she almost never eats steak you see what I'm saying [Music] but he began to speak but he said this [Applause] are you brothers and sisters they made many talked about the soul and sometimes I've heard God's servants a soul is the nature of the spirit and what's awkward separates the soul from the spirit is the god word it's quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword of the Sun they men it could reach the jokes in the marrow I need to go down to the soul and the spirit but God can tell separate the soul from the spirit are you what they're the soul recognized condition for magic leaving only inside I believe such a gorgeous five talks about I'm telling you it's an after house that's carried the spirit in the soul but the house I want to thank you about that you take about the destiny of the soul and the food death what was man like before death death brought about sin bought about death and seeing because Manon disbelieved away and San calls death and that speaks of land is separated from God and being separated from God that's like a wire would not discern if the Sun was not here the grass wouldn't grow and the Sun causes the world that we live in to be seen and the natural earth without the Sun everything will be in chaos and in darkness brother sister we need the Sun without the Sun he said to a world that was in darkness let up in life and God said to you and I when we were in darkness they could see but it's amazing grace came to see about you and I all you with me today God love us God about us before death there was a man in the image of God and in the likeness of God man that didn't know anything about time because he was living in eternity he meant so man comes out of time in to come out eternity at the time but where are we going Jesus come to take us back to when he came from going back from time back to eternity back from the prison house he meant for he said and first Peter 3 amen he said the spirits that were imprisoned in the times of no he meant the word they meant and then he talks about the souls that was saying was only each Souls than the time of the flood I'm talking about last long and we have the sense of / hey Dad the Holy Ghost can be only inside but we're in a present house fall this body that we have it holds back our potential because it does not yet appear what we shall be seen what God will do for you and I why because this corruptible is holding us up this flesh is holding our PR Feeney but one day amen we're gonna break the chains of death the last enemy that's gonna be destroyed is death we're gonna tear the flesh you can't hold me no law hallelujah before there was ever a lot we had the truth are you with me so the devil came with the law and the devil came with the lie and the Bible said that that devil was the father in st. John 8 he somebody speaking a lie he's speaking of himself because he's the father of lies so lies came from the devil and it's a he provided the truth and the devil provide what God's Word and try to make you believe Allah even but you got to stand fast God's Way oh yes there's a corrector the still in the world and he wants to come wrapped away but you like to stay what away your soul depends on your faith you like the whole the God's unchanging here you got to know that's your soul here in the second Corinthians five it tells us for we I want to do you know second which is five and one for we know I don't believe anybody know he sacks thought we know I wish we still go shake him but what we know I know I said I know what about you brother sister we know why didn't know that you know the devil even doesn't matter what he say but we know we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were deeds of event we have a building of God a house in it not made with hands eternal in to heaven the Bible says God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son who say ever believed in him should not what that parish in it I wonder how many Walter parish man is looking to Mars and the planets because I know the earth is falling apart the scientific world is Sachin threatened experience experiment trying to find a way of escape because they know they're searching for immortality they're looking for something that will cause them to live forever because there is a craving on the inside with all the intelligent minds with all the research to find what about the soul if the flights don't want to die that the flash don't want to get old after flash Oh highs back desire what about your soul no show don't wanna die your soul water live yo s sad wanna live brother sister friend if that equation don't give up hope I got somewhere I gotta help somewhere to leave my head he said be dissolve of our air for the house of this time and that were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens find us we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house from heaven amen God has given us a new house for he said well I am there you may be also for in my father's house don't you want to go to my father's house they met father that way I am I want them to come here too I want you to go to my father's house I mean I said it's Father's Day brother next time happy Father's Day I'm going to my father's house amen I want you to go to where I am I want you to be there also hallelujah the destiny of the soul the purpose of Jesus died to liberate your soul David the satchel soul Joe you have fear of dying because you're going back to where you were the food death came into be I got to go back home to the father's house I got to go back to where I came from what does the soul consist so what am I characteristics what is my DNA what is my genes all about where did I get my attributes from oh that God will make no I believe we ought to know who our Father hears I believe we ought to know why we came from a mad because I believe when the father call they make jokes that he have called me one day and when he call I will respond I will answer I said you call you one day when he knows your name I said he knows his sheep and he can call you by your name I believe that when you call my name and when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there oh yes I will Wow yes in the Deaf can hold my body down so as we journey on the destiny of the soul immortality I want to live not for no one I want to live
