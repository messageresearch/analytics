read the book of Joshua the only thing they had to do is be strong amen and very courageous amen and to be courageous sometimes you're going to see some things that's going to scare you you going to see some things that's going to shake you up but as long as you are strong and courageous almighty God will see you through to the End Amen Hallelujah you love the Lord this morning praise God I
