Everything. Amen. God is good. Amen. Let us bow our heads in a word of prayer. We have a special need. You can make it known by lifting up your hands. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you tonight, Lord, for all you've done for us, Lord. And oh God, even for the things that you have in store for us, Lord. We say thank you tonight, Lord. We pray, oh God, by your spirit, Lord, that you would continue to move upon your people, Lord. That you would continue, Lord, touching lives, Lord, and healing bodies, Lord, according oh God to your power, Lord. We just pray, oh God, Lord, tonight, Lord, for those knees that are lifted, the hands that are raised, oh God, the hearts that, oh God, turn towards you. I just pray, God, that you would bless them tonight, Lord. Oh God, uh, Sister Ramsay, Lord, and Sister White, Lord, and those that ask for prayer. Sister Shannon, Lord, I pray, God, you'd bless them and touch them, Lord, in a mighty way. Oh God, we pray, oh Lord, that if we said or did anything that ain't like you and if it would offend you, God, tonight, Lord, I just pray, oh God, that you would help us, oh God, Lord, that we would be reconciled to you, Lord God, that your spirit might have the preeminence. Bless your children. Bless those that are here. Bless those that had a desire to come but couldn't make it at night. Oh God, I pray you continue touching lives and bodies. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Let the church say, "Amen." God is good. Amen. We want to look at the book of of uh St. John by the grace of God 19 and St. John 1. Amen. St. John 1 and 19. They kind of deviate just a little bit from faith. Amen. It's something that was going over with the children the other night in Bible study that kind of got me stirred a little bit. Amen. St. John 1 and 19. If you got it, say amen. And it reads, "And this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, who art thou?" I might need the screen. I don't Let's see. &gt;&gt; And he confessed and denied not not but confessed, I am not the Christ. And they asked him, what then art thou Elias? And he said, I am not. Art thou not the prophet? And he answered, no. Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What says thou of thyself? You may be seated. I'm going to read down a little further. He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah, and they which were sent were of the Pharisees. And they asked him and said unto him, Why baptize thou then if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, nor that prophet? John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you, when whom ye know not, he it is who who cometh after me is preferred before me, whose shoes latched, I'm not worthy to unloose. These things were done in the besta beyond Jordan, where John was baptized. The next day John seeth Jesus cometh unto coming unto him and says behold the lamb of God who take away the sins of the world. This is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me. For he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel. Therefore I am come baptized with water. And John bear record saying I saw the spirit descended from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him. We can stop right there. I just tonight by the grace of God for just for a moment I want to talk about the value of Christ. Amen. The value of Christ. You know John here. One thing about John. John knew how important Christ would be when he come. Amen. You know, and when I say the value of him, you know, you know, John, when they was asking John who he was and what was his role, I guess, to play and he was saying, "I'm not the one." He says, "But he said there's one coming." He says, you know, among you now, he says that I'm not even worthy to un loose the latchet of his shoes off his feet. Right? So John knew that when he was pointed out, all the attention should be on him. Right? But we find today that people they want to put attention everywhere else but on Christ, right? But the importance of Christ, he he's more valuable. As I was saying to the children the other night, I says one day people will realize that Jesus Christ was more important to them than anything in this world. &gt;&gt; Come on, just think about that. And something kind of got in my spirit and I was telling people, you know, I was praying for people this week and I says, you know, I was telling everybody I was talking to, I said, you know, one thing I says, one day you're going to realize everything else out of all the things you you chase after in life and all your achievements and all of your goals, right? Which we have to do things to live on this earth, right? I says, but you're going to realize one day and I hope you on the right side, right? that he was more important than all that, right? He was more important. How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; John when he saw him, you know, like I says, all the importance was on him, John says, I ain't even worthy to loose your shoes, Lazar, right? I ain't even worthy. He says, he says when he come, right, he says, but when he saw him, he says, behold the lamb of God, right? This is the one that I've been talking to y'all about. I come to baptize only just to prepare the way for him. He says but but now he's here right and he says in one place he says I must I must decrease right and he got to increase but all the focus right I could see it even when they said that the the salutation reached Elizabeth's dear before John was born she said the babe in her womb leapt for joy right because it was all about him right don't you know that I says all of our our makeup all of our being all the things you know is thinking about in this life. Hey, I just been meditating on this this week. I said, all of that, you know, I was searching seem like for and all of that you say you can achieve and all this, but all of that, don't you know that after after it's all said and done, it won't be one stone left upon another, right? All of that that you you bu all that you're trying to get, all you're trying to achieve, all you're building, which God blesses us, right? blesses us with you know like he says one place the scripture says the heavens or heavens cannot contain thee right says heaven is is his throne earth is his foottool what house will you build me all these things don't you know he feels all in all hallelujah so to make him the main focus of your life right I said how important how is the values how important is he don't you know he's like we always say uh shar my my friend he says that he was he he was a man. I say he was more than a man. He was he was everything. Right? Not only was he everything, he still is everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. How valuable is he to me? He's my healer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's my savior. Right. He's my provider. Everything that I need. I don't got to go to nobody else. He's got it all that I need. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's how valuable he is. Right. So, I was playing with the children. Not playing with them. God knows. We was talking to him the other night in Bible study, right? And I says, "What we going to do? We going to make like this judgment day, right?" I says, "What we'll do?" And I explained to them how we being judged now that we don't have to be judged later because judgment begins at the house of God, right? I says, "But I'm going to say, come on." I said, Josiah, I says, "You have to stand before the throne of judgment, right?" I says, "Why shouldn't God let you in?" Right? Is it because of how good you been? You can't say, right? Is it because of your mama? Because of your daddy? Because your uncle Ernest a preacher? I said, everybody else might be good, might have did good, might have lived good, right? I said, but don't you know, not one of us can take your place on that day? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, a lot of people don't don't they don't grasp that in their mind. They they might look at my mama, my daddy, right? And and though we might be sitting on you might be sitting on the other side and say, "Yeah, but one thing about it, when you stand before God, you got to answer for yourself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? Can somebody say amen? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth, ain't it? You got to stand by yourself, right? And you got to answer. And I says one thing about it, we I said, "Come on, plead your case." Right? And the thing about it is I said, "But you know one thing on that day you going to have no case to plead." Right? I says, "Because what it is," I was telling him, I said, "Play back the tape." Every service that you sat in, right? The man of God preached the word, didn't he? Called out, called you to give your life to God. Give your heart to God. Try to tell you that Jesus was the best thing that you can decision you could ever make. Called out to you. Right? I says, "Play back the tape. What did you do? Did you move or did you just sit still? Right. Come on. Let's play back the tape. So, we were going and I saw that. I says, "Lord," I says, "But what it is, this is going to be real now, ain't it?" &gt;&gt; Come on. I says, "But when before you leave here, I believe you already know where you where you're going at." Come on. Because of what it is, I said God won't have to judge you, right? You'll judge yourself by the decisions that you made, right? &gt;&gt; I says, "But one thing that you'll realize on that day, right?" I says even even with you and I as Christians, right? I look at and I was going over that scripture. I believe it's Isaiah Isaiah 60 or 61 or so or 63 somewhere somewhere in there. It says, "But all your righteousness, right, is as what? Filthy rags, ain't it?" I said, even I can't say, "Lord, I won't let me in. I did this. I did that." Come on. None of that ain't going to matter. All of that is as filthy rags. Right? Why? Because I can only do for God because God allowed me. Right? If God hadn't come, it's all about him. See, the value is all on him now, right? &gt;&gt; Because remember, if he hadn't have chose you, you'd have been lost just like everybody else. &gt;&gt; If he hadn't have known you, right? Hallelujah. From the beginning and wrote your name there, you'd have been lost like everybody else, wouldn't you? Come on. It wasn't about you. He says, "Before you was formed in your mother's womb, I already knew you, right? I chose you. You didn't chose choose me." Hallelujah. So what all the focus is on to him that makes us say Lord thank you for choosing me. Hallelujah. Oh God out of all that you could have chose. I'm so glad that you chose me. Right. COME ON. OH GOD THAT'S HOW much valuable you are. Cuz all of the good that I THINK I I DONE IN LIFE DON'T MEAN NOTHING. THIS HAS FILTHY RAGS. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; John says I I might be John might could have says I'm voiceing one crying IN THE WILDERNESS. BUT I'mma tell you, even all that I'm doing, I ain't even worthy to loose the latch on the shoe. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I ain't even worthy that. But one thing about it, he was the lamb. Hallelujah. When I need when you need somebody in that day, I said you're going to realize how important Jesus was. Hallelujah. That I can't say speak of none of the good that I done, but it's all of what he's done for me. Hallelujah. I can see Jesus saying, "You stood for me. Now I'm going to stand for you." Hallelujah. I ain't look the father. I ain't looking at what they done, but I'm looking at the blood and the lamb that was slain. Hallelujah. So, how important will we be then? Come on. Oh, Jesus. Come on. ALL THE MONEY YOU HAVE. I says one thing about it. I was looking looking once at a at a video and they had they had uh Michael Jackson, right? He dropped out of the ceiling and he come out the ceiling and by the time he got to the stage with them lowering them on the thing probably 5,000 people done passed out. Come on. And he stood there for about 10 minutes. Then he moved his arm to his glasses. Another 5,000 probably passed out. Come on. He pulled them glasses down. in the first 20 minutes he ain't done nothing and I don't know how many people they done ambulance coming to get him they were so excited about seeing Michael Jackson come on BUT ONE THING ABOUT MICHAEL Jackson on that day how much fame how much money no matter what he going to need he going to need the lamb right &gt;&gt; come on somebody say amen with me &gt;&gt; come on now is it true &gt;&gt; it's true AIN'T IT &gt;&gt; THE VALUE of them right I SAYS WHEN YOUR EYES CLOSE NOBODY NOBODY CAN'T TALK FOR YOU. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's why they said, "Let the words you done speak for you." Right? But I'm going TO SAY IT LIKE THIS. Even your works is as filthy rags, AIN'T IT? I WANT THE LAMB TO SPEAK for me. Hallelujah. I want the lamb to say when they say, "Play back the tape." HALLELUJAH. HE MIGHT HAVE HAD HIS FAULTS as ups AND DOWNS. BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, IN HIS HEART, THAT'S WHERE I CAME IN. HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE PREACHER CALLED OR WHEN I CALLED FOR HIM, HE ANSWERED. HALLELUJAH. AND I CAME INTO HIS HEART. AND IT WASN'T ALL AT ONCE SOMETIME, BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE, HE ALLOWED ME TO MAKE CHANGES. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WENT FROM ONE ROOM TO THE NEXT, SWEEPING IT OUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS. &gt;&gt; OH, that makes me feel all right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; One room to the next. Come on. &gt;&gt; I says you got to when you think GOD FINISHED WITH YOU, God open another door. A little another hidden door. Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's go in that room. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Oh, I ain't got no PRIDE. HE OPENED THAT DOOR. YOU JUST as proud as everybody else, right? Let me go in there and sweep that room out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that God cleans us up. Right? &gt;&gt; I said judgment begins at the HOUSE OF GOD. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DON'T PREACH NO HARD. DON'T SAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE JUDGED NOW. WE BE JUDGED THEN. RIGHT? BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, I'LL SAY, "GOD, JUDGE ME NOW. &gt;&gt; EXPOSE MY LIFE. OPEN UP EVERY DOOR, EVERY ROOM. LET ME SEE WHERE I AM, GOD." HALLELUJAH. IT MIGHT HURT MY FEELINGS, BUT LET ME SEE WHERE I'M AT. LET ME BE HUMBLE ENOUGH TO SAY, "LORD, I'M THE MAN." HALLELUJAH. CLEAN ME UP. &gt;&gt; COME ON. HOW MANY want to be cleaned up tonight? &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. And when you think you cleaned up, God said, "I got to clean you up some more." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What it is, God let stuff happen to show you you got to come a little bit further, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe that. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. We glory not in our faults, but we glory and God loves us enough to show us where we wrong at. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; To show us where the pride, the sin of pride is in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You thank you somebody, right? &gt;&gt; You think you it is. SO GOD SOMETIMES HUMBLE YOU DOWN, BREAK YOU DOWN, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody the other day, we was talking about some individuals and individuals out there that we know at work. And I says, you know, one thing about it. I says, if you was in that person's position, that would be rock bottom for me. It would have been rock bottom, right? I says, "But what it is, everybody bottom ain't the same." Come on. They can have nothing and still walk around thinking that they don't talk to me. Don't tell me I I I got it all. You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE LIKE THAT, ain't there? &gt;&gt; CUZ EVERYBODY BOTTOM, BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I SAID, "GOD, I'm so glad that you open my eyes and let me see." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. When you think you hear, God say, "Hey, he show you." Right? But what it is, I SAYS ON THAT DAY, WE GOING WE GOING TO HAVE TO REALIZE what the value of it is, right? I was sharing with the children. This was some time ago now. I says, "Let me show you how all the you think you doing good, all the righteous and all that. So, let me show you what it's like." And I I I pretend like I took a a a rag and take it in the toilet, right? Wet it. It's nasty, right? Spray something on it. Smell real bad. This is what it's like, right? Come on. I said there's one thing you got to realize. You got to learn how to let go, right? &gt;&gt; And let God come on. It ain't what I can do, but it's what he's done for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's why I said John, he put all the attention on on on Christ, right? Come on. I'm not the one. NO, I'M NOT. NO, NO. HE SAYS, BUT HE IS. AND THAT'S why when I you see him say, "Hey, behold the lamb of God." Right there he is. That's who I'm trying to POINT YOU TO. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU RIGHT THERE. THAT IN THE END THAT'S the one you GONNA NEED, RIGHT? MAMA CAN'T STAND FOR YOU, DADDY, BROTHER, SISTER, COUSIN. I DON'T IT DON'T MATTER HOW GREAT OF A PERSON, WHATEVER THEY WERE. COME ON. YOU NEED THE LAMB. HALLELUJAH. YOU GOING TO HAVE TO KNOW HIM FOR YOURSELF. COME ON. AND ON THAT DAY, THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ONE YOU WANT TO SAY, COME ON, YOU STOOD for me. HALLELUJAH. COME ON. WELL DONE, MY GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT. I can see those where Jesus is making the parable. He says, come says the the the one that says, "Haven't we done great works in your name?" He said, "Depart from me, you that work iniquity, I ain't never knew who you was." Come on. He says, "But the other one, he going to say, come on." IT SAYS, "WHEN I WAS SICK, YOU visited me." Hallelujah. When I was lonely, you come and comfort ME. HALLELUJAH. WHEN I WAS IN JAIL, you know, HE SAY, HE SAYS, THEY SAID, "LORD, WHEN WHEN DID WE DO THIS?" COME ON. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T, THEY DIDN'T SEE THEMSELVES AS DOING IT, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; COME ON. THEY DIDN'T SEE THEMSELVES AS NOTHING. BUT HE SAYS WHEN YOU DID IT to the least of my brethren, hallelujah, you done it also unto ME. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. HALLELUJAH. NOT GOING TO GOD SAYING WHAT I DONE OR OR WHAT YOU GOT SOME RIGHTS. ONLY RIGHTS YOU GOT IS THE ONES THAT GOD GAVE YOU ORDAINED FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME. HALLELUJAH. And that's because he put your name there. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Somebody give God praise tonight. I SAID THE VALUE. Come on. The value. I was told somebody the other day. I said you know one thing. I said time gone. And I says one we looking at now as war look like boom pray.

I was telling them down in SA and uh I said brother Gordon remember that he he was saying that song. Remember that song bless me indeed. Bless me. Enlarge my territory. I remember brother Gordon saying that's one of the most selfish songs he ever heard. He says, "But then when I was laid off and they ain't had a job for what, almost two years or something, I remember him telling the testimony and he sung that song one Sunday morning was in the old building and I said the anointing came down and he said, "Lord, what it is, it ain't selfish. Lord, I need a blessing." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless me indeed. Right? &gt;&gt; I was sharing that with the church and something, but that's the truth. see what it is. I hope you don't mind, brother Gordon. But I said what it is when it's more than just see to me. I was telling them I'm going to sing me a song one Sunday &gt;&gt; or one one night. It be might be a while. &gt;&gt; But I said long if you got to sing what you been through. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or what you dealing with. See, you just singing a song don't don't matter, right? But when you singing it from the heart because you said, "Lord, come on. Bless me indeed." Hallelujah. Enlarge my territory. Not because I'm just want to be greedy, but God, I need you to bless me. You promise that if I be faithful, God, that you'll bless me, Lord. Come on. You singing a song about healing, about deliverance, whatever it is. It's that that's that's where you at right now. Hallelujah. Come on. And you living the life. Not not you ain't living the life now, but you living the life, right? And you saying God and God said, "I would have blessed you the whole time, but you have not because you asked not.
