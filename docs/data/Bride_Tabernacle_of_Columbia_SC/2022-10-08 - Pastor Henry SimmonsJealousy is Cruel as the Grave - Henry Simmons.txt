I mean eight and six eight and six the songs of Solomon eight and six set me as a seal upon thine heart and as a seal upon that arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the greed the coals there are coals of Fire which has a most vehicle Flame God bless the reasons words you may be seated Genesis 20 I mean 37 Genesis 37 and 4. Genesis 37 and four I says jealousy is cruel as a grave we have seen jealousy and jealousy it's a great hindrance of the body of Jesus Christ the prophet of God preached a message from that time from that time from that time when jealousy comes in from that time it changes the complex of one's life that persons can never be the same as long as that Spirit exists but sometimes the spirit Creeps in unaware but no doubt the attributes of it the tree is known by its fruit the manifestation of it I've seen ministers jealous of ministers I've seen church members jealous of church members I've seen employees jealous of other the employees I've seen the spirit of jealousy being around for a little while and I've seen the damaging effects of jealousy I've seen the crippling effects of jealousy and I'm telling you jealousy runs rampant in all forms of society in all walks of life jealousy affects one's life in a major way and when that spirit of jealousy gets upon a person you know sometimes it comes because God has rejected the person when God rejects rejected Saul it didn't immediately happen because Saul disobedience we'll get there after a while because it's all Saul disobed God disobeyed God yet he had a lot of sacrifices that he made yet he bought back what he thought God would please God when God told him what to do he said kill everything but he thought it was you know he said I listened to the people you know sometimes we give excuses for what we have done under Disobedience to God's word when God gives you the word it's no excuse for not obeying what God Said and God speaks to us speaks our heart by the holy spirit is no excuse would not obeying what God said to us the Holy Spirit would never leave you wrong the holy spirit always leads you how you know when the Holy Spirit is leading you right you can search it out by the word holy spirit always leads you to obey the word it doesn't matter or your compromise and your feeling how you think about it it doesn't have anything it's what the word say when we're outside of the word we're outside of God's Divine protection we're outside of the word we're outside of the will of God that means the blessing that God would have blessed us with he cannot bless us until we're back into the promised land are you with me we got to come back into the promised land and God's promised land for us is his word and his word said if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you can ask what you will and I will do it but outside of the promised land outside of oh God your Homeland what God has given you he given you his word are you with me and you get out of the Homeland then you curse yourself you cannot look for the blessings of God to be upon you out of your Homeland that's why when you get back in your Homeland then you're ready to receive the blessings that come from God here we are um 37 and four it says oh I got me some readers in here come on brother Ernest God bless you you said and when his Brethren saw that their father loved him more than all the brethren they what hated him did what hated him oh Lord not me let me see what jealousy is all about as the dictionary says jealousy work work are afraid that some one is taking the love of the attention one has a warrant does that sound familiar jealousy worried or afraid that someone is taking the love all the attention one has or wants unhappy in the Years and he talks about the images means jealousy or dislike felt because of different things I'll get to that later hopefully but jealousy examine yourselves and see whether you be into Faith see whether that Spirit ever comes up to try to latch on to you as individuals see whether that Spirit ever enter into you and begin to tempt you will begin to wow you when jealousy takes hold of you sometimes you folks have said I don't like her I don't care for her nine out of ten you say well that ain't what I mean that ain't what you mean but many times that's what you're saying when you say I dislike her I don't care for her that many times that's a jealous spirit are you with me now if you're just a plain devil you just don't like that devil that got a hold of that person so you've got to distinguish the the spirit then the uh the person because sometimes it's a spirit on a person that you dislike it's not the person that you dislike it's a spirit that's on that person that you dislike are you with me man so when you say I don't like that person you got to talk right because a Christian don't talk like that you know uh but a baby does a baby talk like you know any kind of talk come out of their mouth when they babes they can talk like that you know because they know you know baby Christians that hadn't come to maturity they said certain things out of their mouth because they are babes but when we become matured Christians we try to watch what we say and be careful what we speak and how we say and how we conduct ourselves as matured Christians are you with me and I don't believe God coming back for a baby church but he's coming back for a church that's mature with that spot we wrinkle blemish any such thing so this church in this last age must be come to Perfection come to maturity are you with me so if you're gonna be a part of the Bride word amen church then you're gonna have to come to maturity and now it's the responsibility that God has put in the hand of the five-fold ministry to bring you to perfection are you with me so uh God sent his word and it healed it delivered them okay so um he's saying you know Joseph and his brother his brother had a problem with him and one of the problems is because the father what loved him it's not that the father didn't love them his father loved them too but it just seeming like that was a little extra love to Joseph and because of that a little extra put over there his brother's what he hated him did Joseph have anything to do with that his father loving him like that what did Joseph do to deserve for his father to love him he just was a Joseph and I'm saying when you're a Christian amen and you got God in the inside all you got to do is be a Christian for folks that hate you for the world love there what oh all you got to do is be saved all you got to do just uh live a holy and Sanctified life and just be saved folks just gonna hate you they hated Jesus we died of what without a cause they gonna hate you without a call they just you know hate you and I'm gonna tell you some folk in the church I hate you worse than the folks in the world because a religious spirit is ten times worse than the people in the world are you with me okay let's the fifth verse brothers and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told his brother and they hated him yet the more oh goodness when God is getting a hold of somebody and they you know a little spiritual and you know trying to be nice to tell him about it huh you can see him who he think he is telling us this dream they probably didn't even want to hear it because of who he was I don't even want to hate him you know how folks get the they got that little group and their little skills them and here's some I I don't want to have him I want to hear her she ain't got nothing to say to me and you can see the attitude on them they don't even know that they gotta let him know you know they go on and you can see that you know if it was the right spirit sometimes you know a person don't have the right spirit and you don't want to deal with that spirit are you with me so you're dealing with spiritual wickedness that got a hold of that person so you're praying God be merciful so you have to do everything to maintain and keep yourself in the love of God because the spirit amen is trying to conduct itself in a way it should not conduct itself with a so-called brother or sister and when that spirit is conducted in itself you know and not becoming godliness of Holiness then you got to be able to resist the devil because of that Spirit overtake you you become one like them you know I said if if there's a bad attitude it should not cause you to have a bad attitude but having a matured people Christian because people are babes in Christ if somebody come to them with a nasty and a bad attitude you know what you come here with that bad attitude you know what you're gonna get another bad attitude are you with me because you ain't coming here with that y'all hear me [Music] a lot of times folks they know they can take advantage of the preaching didn't come with a bad nasty attitude and the preacher guy just be quiet take it the preacher King said nothing foreign get behind me say the preacher had to take everything from everybody if he just raised his voice a little bit then his his attitude is bad but they can be just as nasty and some folks are ornery as can be and the preacher had to take it all right but that's the way God made the preacher he has to take you because why he is the one that has to give account for the people he can't allow their bad attitude to get on him and listen God give him permission to cast that devil out are you with him see it comes a time when God said okay that devil and linger too long devil get out of here are you with me Paul let that woman these men are the great man I thought 80 minutes following them around they were telling the truth wasn't it but that was a lying spirit that was a witchcraft Spirit on that woman and Paul had to turn around after a period of time and he had to rebuke that devil are you with me so so no no no no don't think that because the preacher has to take certain things it come a time when the preacher got to God give him a mission to rebuke the devil I don't want to speak the preacher might have wasn't expecting to do it but it came a season and a time where God said call it the devil and let it not be known that that is the devil and that is the devil that's got to hold it Jesus said Peter get behind me who Satan you think Jesus apologized for saying that Peter I'm sorry I call you Satan no he didn't apologize because he wasn't talking he wasn't addressing Peter he was addressing Satan that had gotten a hold of Peter are you with me so we got to realize that we're not addressing a person we have to address the spirit and you better be sure you're addressing the spirit and not that person because God gets you from damaging one of his little children it doesn't matter if you to preach it doesn't matter you the Deacon doesn't matter who you are it's a touching out my anointing no matter how wrong they are don't touch them I I might get there hopefully but it's the time was gonna fail me y'all know about David and Saul no matter how he was God said don't touch him David said don't you touch God's anointed you had many times he had a time a chance to kill Saul but he didn't kill him did he because he knew what the word said touch not my anointing do my prophets know harm are you with me so God see sometimes we oh God I can't if I could sit at we ain't just dare to try sometimes folks you know they'll say things that Angels wouldn't even say you know and some preachers that say things and Angels wouldn't even say you're gonna we've got to be careful if we get real in accusations angels are afraid to do it let's let's go I gotta get I'm getting ahead of my whole story tonight but go ahead on brother Ernest and his brother hated him to move didn't it man go ahead and he said unto them here I pray you this dream which I've dreamed for behold we are buying we we're binding sheaves in the field and load my shifa rose and stood upright and behold your shoes stood round about and made obesience to my sheep and his brother and said unto him shall thou indeed Reign Over Us or shall thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words I'm gonna tell you foreign can make hate amen come to his balling point hate would come to his boiling point you know when when haters take place he ain't got no nice thing to say every time they think they hear the name they call they're going to say something bad negative if somebody tried to say something nice about sister so and so they got a negative thing to say well well sister Renee she just oh no she ain't that I remember sometimes on and so and so um sister so and so and so oh no you can't say nothing about it but Josh or Josh he does you know y'all ever been around anybody to be negative about everything yo y'all might need to tell it because that's your friend I I I I I can excuse them because they my friend uh you know we we've been friends a long time but just a negative attitude always something negative to say always some can never lift nobody up because why it might ruin their reputation you know what I'm saying because they're always looking for self-gratification and they always want to be lifted up so they would never lift anybody else up are you happy just get their loose up they hated him the more go ahead on and he dreamed he had another dream and told it his Brethren and said behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars made obesions to me and he told it to his father and to his brother and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou has a dream shall I and thy mother and thy brother indeed come and bow down ourselves to lead to the Earth and his brother when envied him but his father observed the same see his brother envied you know what I'm saying the enmity they was jealous you know but his father observed the same see what I'm saying y'all know the story of Joseph and what happened so we're not going to get into the depths of that but we know in Cain and Abel Cain was jealous of the sacrifice that Abel gained and he had an opportunity to straight nodded but you think he was going to do it you turn around because he was jealous of his brother jealousy is cruel as a what grade he was jealous of his brother he turned around he killed his brother amen amen are you with me jealous you'll take you further than you want to go that's Caleb say the book of James 3. jealousy takes you farther than I'm skipping over the all this about Saul and and David and all and hopefully I may not get back to it but but by the grace of God you got to watch examine yourself because a lot of anger and bitterness speed and built up somebody Did You Wrong somebody said something to you somebody thought something you you just you hear that name and you could have trimmed him not effective you like that you have to tell Lord if you forgive a person forgive them from the heart amen and if you forgive them from the heart then that all that that that that shaking and that nervousness and you don't want to look at them you got to hold your head down you see since it's so and so on [Music] you see brother some sister some other sister you you give one sister hug and you almost like something on her own with your hand you know you can't even Shake hand with them why you didn't gossip about them and talk about them and say it all kind of nasty stuff about them and you but they got the problem they have the problem but when you done all kind of stuff you can't even look a person in the face why because you thinking in your mind that they are your worst enemy that they are your biggest problem you know you you want to be a victim somebody hurt me somebody done me wrong or somebody doesn't care oh no oh God got to stop that crime come to maturity see sometimes we we cry because we want to be the victim and we want the attention I want attention why it's a spirit the spirit of jealousy I'm gonna show you what the spirit of jealous and envy would do you know it's chaotic it's very chaotic you let a spirit of jealousy get among the people and you're gonna have a a chaotic place I've had people in Ministry and people in life and they were jealous and I'm gonna tell you something can I go with you I said no but I didn't have nothing there I said no you that would be too many or something but you know that person I hate it and goals before you and tell everybody brother send me that you see what I'm saying because why a jealousy because why you can't take me why I can't go with you why I can't do this why why you choose them over me I see what I'm saying jealousy why did God accept evil and then accept mine why Joseph have to be more spiritual than all of us can you see a church the church didn't have a 12 members but you can you see a church with 12 members and all them brothers but one of the brothers seemed to be the biggest problem but he wasn't a problem but it was a spirit of what a spirit of jealous that got in there ruined the whole church guess what they they thought they're going to get rid of that problem their problem with Joseph so they sold him let's get rid of our problem are you with me see what happens I'm gonna tell you if it's a bad Spirit on you I don't care where you go and who you connect with you're going to run into the same thing because you carry the spirit of jealousy and that Spirit has to be dealt with and when that spirit is not dealt with you know we try to be oh I'm so humble I'm so sweet I'm so kind but in the heart I can't stand I can't stand her she thinks you're cute she thinks she looked better than everybody else you do look better than you though it don't ain't no harms a lot of folks look better than me that's an absent fella I mean I can't help because I got a big nose and a little belly and all that [Laughter] all right but I ain't jealous of brother Dave see what I'm saying but we we think they got to be jealous it's got to be enemies you see what I'm saying or somebody because they think they look they think they look better than me think about you are you with me ain't had nothing to do with how they look you know oh this one can play better than me don't even say any better than me they can sing about how can I change them be quiet they can't sing better than you but I no you can't play better than them oh yeah yes I know you can't you can't see sometimes folks don't want to hear the truth but you just tell them the truth anyhow but sometimes oh that's my friend I ain't gonna tell her the truth yeah I think you can do you telling that lie now you got a lying spirit you should have went on and told him I ain't gonna say nothing I ain't getting into that now are you with me and you better pray for because they need to be if you're a real friend you just tell them they can't say any better than you let's see what they still be your friend yeah I thought you were gonna say something like that because you like them better than me that's the first thing they're gonna say why and you know they're gonna say that and they're gonna find a way that they ain't gonna keep no company with you either so you don't lost your best friend are you with me even if you've got a sister in your own family that think they can do this and that everybody got to take they jump because they Superior are you with me Brothers you know sometimes the person that wants superiority is not the one that needed the one that's the humble this one that's the one that needs the attention that's the one that needs to be exalted but the one that's exalting got everything you know that's the one need to be humble are you with me because God resists the what he gives grace to the world humble notice the humble may not they may need some attention they might need something but they're not they're not gonna voices why it's humility that keeps them that keeps them humble and God's Own time God to give them what they need God would exalt him in due season if they just stay humble and stay in the will of God God will bless him but as many if we get out of our humility and get out of the harmlessness of the heart and the meekness of the Lord and the kindness of the Lord and the gentleness of the lord we get out of there man we get it out of we're getting out of our homeland we're getting out of the word we got to stay there amen be humble before the Lord be humbly humbleness of mine amen amen Lord lordness and meekness and harmonyness of mine okay uh where we at James in James 3 14 Ernest but if ye have better envying and strife in your hearts Glory not he said if you have but if you have Envy and strife in your heart don't Glory you know I said people boast about I ain't taking nothing off of nobody taking nothing off my husband and thinking nothing off my wife I ain't taking nothing on my children taking nothing off of nobody sometimes you need to be quiet and take something off for everybody I ain't gonna be no pushover sometime all that you ain't nothing but dirt we ain't nothing but dirt amen we need to be humble if you think you want to fight you you you you you want to fight the right one you come on goodness this arm all whipping the law fail are not caught on but they're Almighty through God to the pulling down the strongholds well about this fighting and all of this oh talking and concealed weapon permit yes I'm packing I'm packing months though everybody come with us we're going to call this thing Gerald come with those what are they going to call what gottling doing and you got your packing your stuff big and thank you thank you all we need the law God is all about an egg vintage is mine I would recommend said the Lord that takes care of all the bad and tough and rough people but we are children of God amen when children of God not because the preacher preached that not because the bible say that it's just because that's what we really are we cannot help ourselves because the love of God we've been born into a kingdom amen in this kingdom is the Kingdom of Light it's not Darkness he's delivered us from the power of darkness and translated this into the kingdom of his dear son so we act like Christians we conduct ourselves as Christians we can't help because we've been born again and when you were born again your conduct is different you can't help from being different if you were still a sinner yeah yeah try when you say you say Lord help them but God forgive them Lord have mercy on this soul not unless they catch you off guard Lord have mercy they catch you all God or one of your full moon days foreign and then look out you know what I'm saying you know every day and all day long you ain't in the spirit sometimes if you ever slip one in on you are you with me you ain't prayed up that way you ought to be prayed up and then they come oh Lord thinking that and hold on huh and then you'll be crying Lord please forgive me love please forgive me because why I I active out of character I shouldn't have said what I said I've acted out of character and not all I can do is repent and ask God to forgive me and actually individual forgive me I've acted out of character but you know some people ain't gonna forgive you now they're gonna act out of character too because you acted out of Courage you don't mean God just had to bring some things at you to get you a deeper walk with him he allows us to make mistakes and have he allows us to make certain phase that because he's trying to perfect us he's bringing us into gratuity sometimes a child will fall fall fall but after why that child gets strong enough to what walk and that's the way God allows us you know sometimes we it don't mean that we're not born again it means that we need to come to maturity and God is trying to bring us there by showing us our weakness in our failure and when we fail him we immediately repent and ask God for forgiveness and Lord I'm sorry I want to be do better Lord I want to draw close it shows how far I am away that I need to get I need more of you God I'm up here preaching and teaching now and you know and my children my wife and all of them they don't see uh-huh you see what you're saying you don't think they they get me if I you know if you say you preaching you better live it and they're bringing it bring it up you got the little ones praise God they sure will tell you Daddy they know exactly what you said and I'll tell you in a minute are you with me so he says if he be ye have bitter and envy and strife in your heart Glory not and lie not against the truth now you know what you got in your heart now you need to get it out your heart if you got it in your heart get it out your heart if you got it there get it out and don't tell no lie I ain't got no love everybody I don't know nobody I hate the Bible says speak not evil one of another are you with me when you're speaking evil let's go Reno 15. this wisdom Descent of not from above but it's Earthly sensual and devilish devilish no real for where envying and strife is there is confusion in every evil work and the main person talking about all the confusion is the confuser I don't know why it's so much confusion in the church listen listen the one go say sister so-and-so said this about you so and so on said that so and so on to this and that they didn't want to come and told sister so and so so what do you think about so-and-so so-and-so said that about you what you said so and so so and then it goes so so so oh chaotic confusion everybody looking at one another well I had so much confusion in the church you know who calls it the confuser the main person that talks more about confusion is the one that caused all the confusion and don't even know it why because sometimes the spirit will get on a person and blind them like they not to confuse the data Peacemaker oh I'm trying to make everybody love one another and be together with one another y'all love one another but at the same time carrying All the gossip and twisting it a little bit twist what that one say twist what this one say twisting all this twisting everybody hmm rolled up and yeah she was looking at you like that too I saw her I'm gonna tell you so boy you can you can I'm gonna tell you you can see a lot of babies in the church when they talking like that a lot of babies I said Lord have mercy when the people gonna grow up well I ain't even thinking about what y'all talking about love and you love me love me look I ain't thinking about that stuff I'm just preaching the gospel are

feeling you're gonna feel it oh Lord I had a good time with the brother carry on and I said haha laughing at him because everything I go through looked like he go through double potion I did it I had to laugh and I said oh what are you with me see what happens people don't know what you go through they think that everything is just smooth and cool everything is just wonderful and lovely and all you do is get up and preach a sermon and go back home but those Devils ain't gonna let it be that way amen it's just like you got a battle every day to be a Christian and to live a holy life when you go to work folk just gonna not like you just because you're doing it right and just because you're not cutting Corners just because you're gonna do amen are you up man you're doing your job and and and people are commending you and patting you in the back huh and what about a supervisor giving him a raise and putting them over me huh I've been here the longest I've been here long on this job but you can't do the job that person can do the job better and know how to do it but oh and then got jealous of the person don't like the person go around and tell everybody else don't have nothing to do with the person don't have nothing to do with that person praise God you know what I'm talking about Josh back there I feel on the job don't like you you do what like Joshua got another fell asleep man what are you trying to do impress somebody anyway I just look at it man I have about two or three Joshua but he got he kept going through some pressure you let him go out there on the job work like that those people hate him well slow it down boy you better slow it down because we we got to make these owls it's over time and stuff they'll tell you all kind of stuff oh you're with me but you you just think about I got a job to do I'm gonna do my job are you with me people I hate you despise you for no reason at all for you just being Who You Are you're not trying to impress anybody this is in you are you a man so you be who you are don't worry about what folks think of what folks say you just be who you are how God Made You are you a man if they're gonna be evangelist Joseph couldn't help himself there's Brothers he didn't like it we'll be here in 16. every evil word goodness Lord have mercy just entering strife you have every evil word go ahead for where infinite Strife is there is every evil I mean there is confusion that ever even work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceful okay now see if it's wisdom that's from above it's first pure and then is what peaceful the Bible blessed is The Peacemaker things that are going to bring peace things that gonna bring negative and confusion folks asked me he said brother can I do this and I know the confusion that is going to bring I said no well that'll do nothing don't have to do nothing no because I know where they're gonna bring I told some pastors don't do this and don't do that Bishop Bishop Simmons 20 years from then they said Bishop said you were right but you called me Bishop under the right terminology now because you to learn what you thought would work ain't working are you with me that's when humility set in you know sometimes you can tell your children something they ain't got there but you've done been there and you don't been through that are you telling them about it ain't gonna help them none because they think you don't know what you're talking about but 10 years later after that I went through some suffering ah Mom I wish you would have told me telling me all the time but I didn't know yeah you didn't know but if you just someone listening are you with me children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right are you with me folks won't listen you're telling them for their own benefit and I I look at brother carry on I said brother really love his people really love the conjugation but I said man I almost tell them man you have a heart attack in here you know dealing with certain spirits caring so much about the people but sometimes people they just gonna do what they're going to do you can love them all you want and try so hard to get them to do the right things but people you have on their mind when I get 18 I'm getting out of mama daddy house and I'm gonna smoke me a cigarette they have it in their mind they don't have it in their mindset whatever 12 years old some of them have it in there when there's 10 what they gonna do and it'll get bigger as they get older are you with me the demon growth and you think all the word that David handed and been preaching and no they didn't hear nothing all they heard was that Devil's whistling in their ear and every time that word was supposed to hit them I got to go to the bathroom and that word was sent right to him then jump up and run to the bathroom because that Devil's knows it's Gonna Knock that devil out of me but they going to the bathroom then you see and God had a special word just for them and they went to the bathroom just in time for the word they're missing why because it's a spirit in them that didn't want to be cast out are you oh you put him to sleep I ain't saying that because somebody's sleeping tonight but it does those things you can preach your heart out but I'm gonna tell you something it's better for you to pray for your children pray earnestly on your knees cry not to God it's better to pray and say Lord Lord Lord you say oh bless him and your children are grown now because you have to pray harder now no you pray harder now you pray harder than you ever pray why because you you know it don't take my one mistake just one mistake and the devil got him from that time y'all see what jealousy calls Joseph brother to do to him y'all see what jealousy calls Haman to do the medical Malachi he hated all the Jewish people because he was jealous about a guy Mordecai are you with me so he wanted to wipe out the whole Jewish race you see what jealousy called the Pharisees and sightseeing to do to Jesus because Jesus was doing those Miracles and Healing The Sick giving sight to the Blind and all of those things they jealous they they were saying to him so much they took a murder they took Barabbas they took a a one that you know deserved to die but they wanted Jesus to die and let him go free jealousy jealousy jealousy is cruel as the grave I'm gonna tell you something if you let a jealous Spirit get a hold of you Brothers can be jealousy brother Esau and Jacob I'm talking about uh Cain and Ava amen uh Hey guys uh you know Sarah you know what I'm saying it's all kind of spirits can get in at any time the spirit of jealousy can get we have to battle that Spirit we as individuals you know ministers have to uh uh you know uh have to have to pray Lord keep me humble you know but once you know who you are you don't have to worry about being jealous of anybody nobody can be who you are amen if you're saying you may not sing like an angel but you may sing like a you know a whole Little tune you know but thank God for you holding a little to him but that's your position amen you may not play to bless you may not be the best of everybody but thank God for what he gave you nobody can beat you right can't nobody be who you are amen so you said Lord I'm thankful for who I am how you made me it's just one of me and Lord I Thank you amen I don't want to be nobody else I want to be what you may mean and I want to do what you want me to do I want to do your will I don't want to do because I seen brother so and so I do sister so I want to do what you want me to do what would I have many Do Lord I show you I can do it better than them no that is the wrong spirit and you may be able to do it better than them but God wouldn't be pleased with it are you with me you keep the right attitude and the right spirit that means far beyond how you know you can see a person sing like an angel but they got a bad spirit I know I can sing you know what what I think about that I don't want to hear I definitely don't want to hear I can preach I know I can preach I don't want to hear you okay I don't care to hear you preaching okay how good you can preach how good you can think and I know you can do it and you can do it well but you're all in yourself we're here to glorify God it ain't about us it's about pleasing God get all the glory to God be the glory I want him to get the glory out of my life I want him to get the glory amen and and then Lord let me die now I don't even want to be seen it ain't about me being seen it's about whether God is getting the glory out of my life are you up man so brother and sister is all about God getting Glory praise God but sometimes folks want to live oh I want my my husband I want my wife to be lifted up I want my children to be living now it ain't about that it's about God getting the glory it's about God getting the glory but it's a very thin line you see amen we got to recognize when God is using somebody let's let them minister to the people don't say well I let them minister let them be a blessing to the body of Christ don't let don't be like Joseph brother get upset you know what I'm saying don't get a jealous spirit and don't try to exalt something Beyond magic just because a jealous Spirit get in there are you with me all right somebody preached the house down come in here and breach the house down and I said Thank You Jesus let me sit back and relax oh God God is good ain't he I said Thank You Jesus brother but like I hear he's singing over there thank the Lord I'm not going to name somebody get mad at me oh you're with me before God did not do that we coming to mature and tell you with me you're saying you try to encourage people try to say something nice before look at you around and he's saying you John he enjoyed me you know what I'm saying the Lord have mercy isn't that right you can have one two you can have two children anymore and one gonna be jealous of the you have three and one of them gonna feel like they laugh out you said well try to love them all the same but One's Gonna feel like you don't love me are you with me and what you did you can have one and you'll be loving them all the love you can give give them a double portion of love and they still say you love the best parents do the best they can and all that they can and yet they ain't done enough are you with me so y'all understand it you can do all you can the best you can do and you're still gonna fall short and we're gonna fall short we're gonna make mistakes in judgment and what we do we're gonna make mistakes and all we can say is I'm sorry tell your children you're sorry I tell a congregation all the time I'm sorry forgive me amen because all the time your words are not seasoned with salt all the time it's not perfect sometimes you can make a what a mistake can say the wrong thing uh it's received wrong are you with me so you actually ask for forgiveness please forgive me amen but in all of that when matured Christians come to maturity they're able to forgive they're able to love they're able to see as oh thank you thank you spiritually lifted churches don't want to Accord the five God come down the power of God can come in the midst but until the spirit's lifted really forgiveness from the heart then there's no power can't operate like a Moana people can't get healed like they want them people can't get filled with the Holy Ghost because everybody's not on one Accord people are thinking that I'm so spiritual I'm all right all right amen when a spirit of jealousy come in you're not all right you need to get that Spirit off of you you need to pray God make me stronger God strengthen me God I want to I I don't want this to bother me no more I want to be able to treat sister brother so-and-so I want to retreat them with love I want to be God do that for me God bless you and understand to be like Jesus to be like you oh
