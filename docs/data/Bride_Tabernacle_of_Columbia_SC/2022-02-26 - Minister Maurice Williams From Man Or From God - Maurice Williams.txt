lord amen how many kind of the privilege to be in the house of the lord tonight not just to be here but to know why you're here no doubt uh many of us had to you know you have to fight against the enemy to get out to church on a friday night but you know one thing i learned about my god he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek half of him amen when i see people gathered out and coming out to church on a friday night amen just like a sunday morning i see people that's diligently seeking out them amen and my bible lets me know that he is rewarded those people amen hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the lord amen you can be seated just for a moment we always appreciate the the privilege of standing before the bride of christ right here in bride tabernacle and boys appreciate brother simmons they've been brother earnest reaching out amen we just always kind of great privilege i see my great friend brother palmer here to deceive and they mean it's always good to see you brother amen go way back at least way back for me amen and then it's always good to see each and every one of you amen i was sitting back there enjoying the song servers i said well these saints came out like they planned on having church tonight yo we gonna come out let's praise the lord we're gonna worship together amen have a good time in the lord amen hallelujah what can wash your way my sins nothing but the blood of jesus tell me what [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] wow [Applause] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] and there's nothing but the blood of jesus christ amen look with me if you will amen in the book of luke the 20th chapter we started the first verse read down to today first just a couple portions we want to read hallelujah we just always kind of the privilege we're gonna try not to be before you very long in jesus name hallelujah gonna love the lord tonight amen amen if you want the background amen this is when jesus come back to jerusalem before the crucifixion and you know when he get back he already making the scene going to the temple you see them selling the sacrifices and different things so he going in with the whip and flipped the money tables over amen and said my house is a house of prayer you made a dinner thieves man and what he starts to do is he he preaches a little bit more even before he goes off the scene the 20th chapter in the first verse it reads and it came to pass that on one of those days hallelujah sometimes it's one of those days amen but on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel amen he was preaching teaching the chief priests now not just anybody now but the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders and spake unto him saying tell us but what authority does now these things uh who is he that gave thee this authority now think about the question that they asking but here here here's the creator of heaven and earth here's the one who is about to give himself as an eternal sacrifice forever and they got the audacity to ask him about what authority do you even have to preach within the temple who gave you this authority amen now look how jesus answered me sometimes we don't answer every question but what he does is he answers that question with a question yeah but i don't want to blast the same sound this this is a strong mic man according to god this friday night even that's when the eagles fly i'm feeling all right tonight even and we work hard today until we work hard today i said that's because the devil know we got to preach tonight we had a very busy day amen hallelujah now he answers them with a question him and they ask about what authority are you doing these things he answers them with a question and he answered and said unto them i will also ask you one thing and answer me the baptism of john because everybody knew who john was wasn't from heaven or of men what jesus was trying to get them to say was it was these things that you seen and what you saw going on and the things that was taking place on the scene was this a work and a move of god or was it a work and a move of man amen and that's a question that you have to figure out as an individual when you see things taking place when you see things going on is it a work and a move of god or is it a work and a move of man amen and what happened you see they don't have much revelation the fifth verse it says and they reason with themselves saying if we shall save from heaven he will say well why then you you believe ye him not but and if we say of men all the people stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet and they answered they said that they could not tell from whence it was now you know there's a lot of things that people don't understand there's a lot of things about science that people can't figure out but you know when it comes to the things of god it is very important for you to be able to tell where that thing is coming from because otherwise you could be thinking that you're doing god a service without it being his will you could think that you're going in the right direction but you are making a pathway straight to hell amen so it's very important for you to be able to answer the question from which these things came from amen first then they answered that they could not tell whence it was and they first said well if you don't know i can't tell you i can't preach it to you and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things amen for a title tonight amen we're gonna take from man or from god amen from man uh from god let's just buy his one more time father god in the name of jesus lord this oh it's just a privilege lord where we can gather together with brothers and sisters are like precious faith dear god lord people who have committed their lives to the gospel lord and taking a stand for you father god and lord knowing that lord you you know all things you see all things though you rewarding your people lord and i ask that you would give them a double portion of rewards tonight father god lord we always look to leave this place different than how we came in father god and lord how we changed up about a preacher of the gospel lord lord we thank you for your word lord lord howard it speaks to us all that changes this lord is it's not about me as a man father god but lord it's always about your people dear god and about your people being blessed lord and we thank you for that in the love the name of our lord and savior jesus christ may the saints say amen hallelujah you could be seated tonight you know when we look at our scripture verse tonight and you see the people that was on the scene questioning jesus and and when you realize that it it wasn't just anybody out on the scene but the bible lets us know that these were the chief priests amen these were the scribes these these these weren't just the starting out breaches these these weren't maybe just the deacons of the church but these was the knowledgeable people these was the teachers of the people the people that were supposed to be uh leading the rest of the people as shepherds and here they are the greatest thing to ever walk the face of the earth and kid jesus christ is there in the flesh preaching the gospel to the people in it and these people amen them being learned scholars seemingly they would have had an understanding of who he was and where he came from see the problem is even though they were leaders even though they were educated even though they had a lot of knowledge maybe of different things around what was going on in israel when it came to the things of god that did not have any revelation in it now us being believers amen that's being master believers we've been well taught about the importance of revelation amen it's a very basic concept to us amen church age book it starts out with cain and abel were brothers but brother branham lets us know that that that that abel had a revelation about what type of sacrifice to offer and even though cain was his blood brother cain did not get that same revelation and what that let us know is that god gives revelation to whom he sees fit and when you get a revelation from god nothing can move you from that revelation it becomes a driving force behind your life it changes how you walk how you talk how you act how you see the word how you conduct your business everything is changed just from you having a personal revelation of jesus christ and on the contrary if you don't have a revelation a personal revelation of christ these things become hard for you amen it don't make any sense you can't understand it because it seems like it's something that comes from man here jesus christ is on the scene he was doing everything that he was promised and prophesied to do it man he called the wonderful counsel of mighty god everlasting father prince of peace amen everything that he was prophesied to do on the scene he was healing people i mean he was healing men that was blind from their birth amen people that was was crippled they may they saw the miracles the water turned into wine even the five thousand fed by the fish and the five loaves i mean they saw all kinds of things taking place when it came to miracles they they saw people's lives being changed where the filthiest of sinners whether it was the publicans the tax collectors that was out there man whether it was the prostitutes of the street coming to wash his feet with their hair man whether it was zacchaeus amen coming down from out of that tree he was a rich man but but he recognized christ when he was on the scene they saw people's lives being changed some miracles taken place some sitting there teaching and preaching the gospel and yet they still couldn't get out of their own way because they had a certain mindset and a certain vision of how god should be packaged and how god should operate and that got in their way and they could not catch the move of god by revelation all the things that was going on and they had to sit there and ask him but what authority are you doing these things in man and the whole thing should have been very plain and should have been very obvious the lord himself said a kingdom divided against himself shall not stand so you wonder how i'm casting out these devils and i'll cast out these demons he said they cannot cast out satan so it's a very basic concept that they should have been able to have an understanding of who he was and where he came from and what was going on at that point in time he answers that question with a question the things that you've seen taking place what you've seen going on was it something that came from heaven or was it something that came from man the preaching that you see amen the teaching that you see the doctrine that's going forward man christ even said down to the baptism that that john was preaching did it come from god or did it come from man and the reason why i i take time with that question is because we know the hour that we are in on god's great time clock and see that's a a question that everybody has to be able to answer for themselves it's a very personal question it's a question that your soul depends on are these things a move a man of all these things a move of god even and one thing i always liked about god is that he is in the business of making things personal to you amen he ain't always in the business of letting you just sit in church and everybody else praising the lord and it looks like we going by group revelation no this thing is not a group revelation you're not going to make it on a group revelation you're going to have to have a personal experience with the man for himself and the only thing that's going to get you all the way into the promised land is a personal experience with him amen that group revelation that the israel's israelites came out of egypt with that might have gotten them over the red sea but that did not get them out of the wilderness it only took the only thing that got them out of the wilderness was a personal revelation of what was going on in the promised land and a personal revelation that they was more than able to take the promised land amen we ain't operating by a group revelation of that in this our way man god is in the personal business he's in the business of you having a personal revelation just like he asked peter well who do you say that i am maybe what do you say for yourself whether you young whether you old whether you got a husband what you got a wife everybody got to give an account for their own experience in this hour when people look at things amen and see that something is only a work of manny man if this thing was only a work of man it would only be able to take your butt so far man a worker man it'll start out for a period of time but then it'll start to fade away when things get rough or when things get tough or the going gets harder when things get confusing when something is a worker man it falls apart but if it is a move of god amen there is not a force in hell that can stop it amen if it's a move of god you can go ahead and put all your chips on the table with it amen and he won't let you fall amen if it's a move of god you can make a life investment into it because god is an eternal god amen he's god and he changes not amen heaven and earth shall pass away but his word cannot pass away so our encouragement to the people of god amen is if you can recognize by revelation that the measure the hour that you're walking in it is not a move a man but it's a move of god this move of god will be able to take you all away man hallelujah glory to god amen there are some rewards that come with you moving in the move of god amen sometimes moving in the move of god it can be unpopular sometimes moving in the move of god there might be some sleepless nights it might be some rocky road sometime but i'm here to remind you and just encourage you for a little while tonight if it is a move of god god is in the business of fulfilling his word amen and all you got to do is abide in the word of god amen and he is going to make sure that his people are taken care of hallelujah how many love the lord tonight hallelujah bless the lord now y'all recognize that we live in a very deceptive age amen the prophet of god said this is one of this is the most deceptive age out of any age amen that that's why this age requires more faith than any other aj man because it's more deception amen that's the whole thing with the land it's inspiring man that you think that you do all right but you're really naked miserable wretched poor blind don't even know about it amen so so it's a deceptive age where maybe a certain church or certain experience think that they're going in the right direction and god said well that's lukewarm i spew it out of my mouth amen you don't even know where you're at it's a deceptive age and see humans when it comes to the thing of god because we try to use our little what we call a p brain amen we try to put that in the god mindset and so we try to look at things of god from our own mindset and what it does is it causes so much deception and it caused so much confusion in me see what happens is is people will say that god is doing something oh this is the move of god that's god doing something and then the further you go you realize the thing getting further and further away from the word and that is not a move of god it's a movement man amen cause he man do stuff that's pleasing to him man do stuff to make him feel good man do stuff that make him feel comfortable amen you know remind me of uh the story of the children of israel and they had a prophet on the scene by the name of samuel and and what happened is the bible lets us know it's about first samuel eighth chapter the bible lets us know that the children of israel they want to be like all the other nations amen they say well the other nations all of them got kings but we don't got a king samuel we need a king that can go in front of us and battle and help us fight our battles and stand there before us and look real good in front of the people and and say no don't do all of that amen you got a king the jehovah god is your king and what actually happens in the scripture is that samuel takes a while and starts to prophesy to him as i said well if you get a king he he takes a whole chapter and said you get a cane oh my he gonna take your daughters and have them in his bakery's he gonna take his sons and have him in his arms he gonna have some building his palaces he gonna put tax on the people all the way on down to this if you get a king a natural can't he gonna do this and do that but nevertheless the people in their own mindset and their own desires said nay but give us a king so we could be like everybody else and what happened they picked the wrong person to be they came they picked saul off a high he looked because he was head and shoulders tall above the rest he had those muscles amen he was graceful and what happened they moved in a complete opposite direction from god because they were stuck in their own mindset on how the king should look at me when almighty god was already the king see they got deceived and got caught in a move of man when a move of god was already right there on the scene amen so so sometimes people think that things are move of god when it's actually a move for man amen it's important amen for us to be able to understand amen when somebody just thinks that's you doing things because a man told you to do it man you doing things because a prophet told you to do it that's been dead for 50 years for uh a goalie man think that you're doing things just because your pastor told you to do it and they start to look at different things that you do and try to box it in as being a move of man amen and miscompletely that is almighty god doing the working man because what happens in this lady to see her age that's all around us people get so quick to pass things off as just being a move of man and it's really a move of god on the scene amen you know what it does is it is it is it forces people to have to to to realign and realize what is your attitude towards this message when you talk about a prophet amen it's easy for people to get caught up and these things just being a move of man amen but then when you start to to look at how this prophet lines up with the word of god malachi 4 and 5 and then comes on the scene amen and you can look back to amos uh three and seven eight minutes and realize that god don't do anything except he show it to his servants the prophets first then you look at malachi 4 and 5 he tell you about how he he sent elijah the prophet back onto the scene again get your heart turned in the right direction then you look in luke 17 and it tells you what's going to be going on amen and that day when the son of man is revealed how they be eating and drinking god noses are eating drinking aj man hallelujah how to be planting and building but they don't build so much denying the prices of houses now that thing does skyrocketed saints they can't even get enough wood to build houses anymore so the same old houses that made it went for two hundred thousand dollars a couple years ago that same house might be 280 300 thousand dollars amen because it's an age of bills baby we start to see how the messenger has showed us how these scriptures are coming in together amos three and seven uh malachi 4 and 5 luke 17 amen then all of a sudden the prophet of god he's revealing these church ages out to us in revelation 3 amen then he said how the church ages unfolding to the seals amen then the seals unfold until the troubles of israel amen then the trumpets unfold and to the vows and what these things start to show you is this they can't be a mover man amen it's got to be a move of god because everything is congruent with the scripture amen and like brother brennan said it's like a roman candle a minute go off and then another revelation go off in the next revelation and go off and you start to realize you can't even exhaust the thought of god amen because it is a move of god it keeps reflecting itself out through the word of god it allows things to keep moving and going forward because if it was a mover man it would have failed a long time ago with me that brother brown said anytime something get going good it fall back and denominate a back and all of a sudden you got a bunch of churches they can't even preach the gospel to the people amen they can't have teller to live right anymore that can't preach more than a social gospel to actually show you where christ is that he's not back here in in the new testament just in matthew mark luke and john but christ is hearing his people amen that can't get the people prepared for a rapture man that can't cause you to make sure that you get your calling election showing man some people look at things and sometimes get these things mixed up as just being a move a man a man but god has blessed you tonight with a revelation amen that you can understand that god is moving and when god is moving you won't just be barely holding on amen but you're gonna be getting stronger amen when god is moving when you can't hold yourself he is going to hold you amen because of the move of god and you moving to his direction amen all you got to do is keep feeding on the word of god amen keep doing the things amen that the word is telling you to do the things that we have been taught to do amen the things that you understand to do by revelation and everything you're gonna be all right man if you see these things as a move of god amen it make it easier to come out the church man because see if you're just coming because man told you to come if you're just coming because you like brother simmons and brother simmons look like he preached hard and he act like he know what he talking about you ain't gonna make it very far like that amen you gonna struggle amen you know one day he gonna say something that step on your toes a little bit too much the wrong way and it's gonna hurt people's feelings and they go a different direction amen you know if it's only a move a man to you then it it it's hard to change how you dress amen if it's only a move a man to you it's hard to change the things that you believe in amen but when you see it as a move of god amen it allows you to dedicate your entire life towards the thing now they asked jesus a great question about the authority that he was operating on the amen and that's good for us to have understanding about authority amen we operate under authority and see if we know what authority that we operate under and if we understand the authority that he operated under then that's going to allow us to exercise a certain amount of power even while we walked this earth hear these great scholars they they knew things about authority but they had no clue what authority christ jesus was operating on them the authority that we operate under means the same things that jesus christ has access to you got access to that as well amen book of romans the 8th chapter amen it talks about how we are heir of god heirs of god h-e-i-r-s we're heirs of god amen and then it turns around and it says that we are joint heirs with christ what that is saying is that everything that almighty god has you have inherited it because you're a part of his bloodline you're one of his heirs amen if you are a joint heir with christ everything that jesus christ has now this is a big statement it's easy for us to say this thing and say oh yeah that sounds real good brother maurice but when you stop and think i'm a joint heir with jesus christ that means that everything that jesus christ has access to i got full access to that same thing so when jesus christ comes on the scene and says father i know that you hear me always and if i'm telling you that you are joint error twice that means that you can have that same testimony tonight when you pray to almighty god you can approach them saying father i know that you hear me always you know when you operate under authority amen the authority of the scripture we can use that to say buying strikes we are healed amen because we know whose authority we are operating under that this authority it allows us amen when we say he will keep us in perfect peace amen because we keep that mind stayed on him hallelujah in an age of great distractions in an age where so much is going on you can take back your peace from the devil god has given you back authority over your mind and over your mind battles amen because he's in the authority giving business he's placed all of the things of the enemy underneath his feet amen the authority that we have saints it fixes families back again amen the authority that we have it makes demons trembling amen the authority that we have it causes us to walk differently from the rest of the world amen the authority that we have it allows us to call those things that are not as though they were it allows us to speak life in all types of situations amen because we operating under authority you know when you come out under authority against the devil you don't got the back of it man and it's not about you doing it on your own it's not about you covering it up but it's about the one that gave you the authority man and when almighty god gives you the authority you don't have to back up from any situation hallelujah when jesus christ was exercising his authority amen and we joined ezra christ he said i got the keys of justin hill now there's a lot of things people got keys for you man there's a lot of things it'd be nice to have keys to that new half a million dollar house amen up there in northeast columbia man it's one thing to have keys to one of them nice porsches that's out there on the lot but all of those keys will fail in comparison to you having the key to the thing that has affected mankind all the way from adam down through eve amen that's affecting man amen no matter how holy paul lived amen one day paul still had to die no matter how good david was and how he had a heart after god's own heart david still had to die man abraham still had to die even though he gave up everything that he had to walk with god he still had to die job lost everything that he had was brought all the way down raised all the way back up but he still had to die one day but jesus christ being on the scene and you being joint ezra christ lets us know you even got the keys to death and hell amen hallelujah according to god amen you got the key to them so we know as believers they mean death is just a tool for us to get ushered into that presence of god amen and the bible lets us know amen there's a shout out voice and trump going forth and one day the whole day of christ gonna rise amen and we gonna see them right here with us amen and all of us gonna be caught up together and that's what the bible teaches us amen we got the keys to it amen everybody is not blessed with that authority everybody is not blessed to know that authority amen but god has blessed you with it amen he's allow you to be able to see it a minute and go forth everybody can't recognize the move of god amen because it takes a special people to be able to recognize the move of god we surely see that by now even no matter how much you could break it down to somebody teach it try to try to piece meal spoon feed it explain today man if god don't have that seed within you from before the foundation in the world it's just gonna be like you trying to learn arabic a minute it's a confusing language it's hard to figure out the characters is backwards the forwards they mean there's little squiggles not even letters they man it just or it's a foreign language to you amen so it takes a special people to be able to recognize the move of god amen because everybody cannot see him amen everybody can't see him moving it see him operating him and like i said with abel and kane i mean you got to see him by revelation of it same thing with jacob and he saw him man as shyster as jacob was jacob had an understanding that there was a certain inheritance that was coming forth amen that there was a birthright and even though he might not have been as good of a man as esau was he recognized what that birthright was and he wanted a piece of that amen as good of a man as he saw was he didn't steal the birthright for an alley it wasn't that big of a deal to him okay my daddy is isaac so what my granddaddy is abraham so what amen your seed is gonna be more than the stars of the sky more than the sands of the seashore and then he will all the nations of the earth will be blessed okay i guess he didn't esteem the promises of almighty god very highly in it but it takes something within you to be able to see him see how he's moving see what he's doing and be able to take that and go in the right direction but everybody can't see it amen the bible lets us know it's gonna be man that take the mark of the beast amen whether you small great rich poor they don't have a revelation to take the seal of god amen but god has blessed you to be able to see him amen what a silly god ain't not but the holy ghost amen that spirit of god within you the new birth within you manifest itself so you can understand so you could see the kingdom of god amen he said except man be born again you can't even see the kingdom of god prophet god told us he means understanding we in a time where the rest of the world will go the other direction amen and sometimes even the church world itself will go the other direction because they cannot recognize the move of god amen god has blessed some people amen that be able to see him by revelation of it and when you come to them and you say well well well you know maybe you was baptizing father son holy ghost but i can show you in acts 2 38 about this name of the lord jesus christ amen if you could see that and go in it it shows you that you have a revelation that we are moving by the things of god amen the ones that see him they see him by revelation and they'll be able to catch a hold to what is going on god has blessed you with something you can catch a hold to what is going on and maybe man might will say well these sisters wearing these little skirts and dress and thing they ain't nothing but a movie man but i could point you in the bible where it got to be a move of god because god says it's abomination amen for a woman to put on that which pertaining from to a man and people forget for also for a man to put on a woman's garment because god knows we got plenty of that nowadays and that's all go back and forth on both sides so people look at you and look at how you carry yourself and say well that's a movement man well i can show you how it's a move of god amen somebody might say well well this woman that got this great gift god let her preach amen that's a movement man the move of god lets me know amen i suffer not a woman to preach or suffer authority over the man amen when a move a man might say well it don't matter what you do and it don't matter if you come to church or you don't come to church a movie god said keep pressing towards the mark amen the move of god will remind you to be ye perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect amen what you have to do get your eyes off yourself get your eyes off of other people's opinions because there's only one opinion that matters even hallelujah we drawn to a close i mean we will keep you all night see sometimes people draw back from the move of god because sometimes moving in the things of all body god it could be a very tough way ain't no way i could sugarcoat that sometimes you're going to look different from everybody else sometimes you're going to be go you're going to be you're going to be going to church a lot more often than a lot of other people amen you're going to be buried in the word and sometimes that thing make people draw back man sometimes you have to give up things and you might not understand the thing that you've given up at the time i ain't talking about simple things like alcohol and smoking amen but sometimes you know you might think that this is the job i need to take out this is the pathway that i need to go in and god because he wants you moving in his direction he he steers you and guides you back by the tender hand of jehovah see sometimes the the move of god it ain't necessarily boom boom boom boom boom overnight but sometimes god he moves with a slow process amen god's time is so much different from our time and in our world and in our society we wanted it done five minutes ago and god said i might take 15 years for it to come to pass the bible lets us know about a young man named joseph amen and you think about that story of joseph how he was all the way down within the pit put in the pit by his own brothers get out of the pit get into egypt get in the potiphar's house think he's doing all right because him being a child of god everything in part of his house being blessed because joseph is there but god got long-term plans and he said joseph your spot ain't just to get up in potiphar's house i still got a lot more for you to do it so now when joseph gets falsely accused put in the jail it seemed like he all the way back past square one he even worse than he was in when he was in the pit thinking he gonna get out of jail and the man that's gonna get him out of jail still forget about him again but because the plan of god is long term that man might have forgot about joseph being in jail hallelujah going to god but i tell you who didn't forget about joseph being in jail almighty god never forgot about him saints almighty god knew the thing that he was going through i imagine it was many a night joseph was sitting in that jail cell and thinking man i ain't never even did nothing wrong and one day to turn to a week a week to turn to a month monster started turning the years and all i was doing from the beginning was trying to be a child within my father's house and here i find myself in jail but we understand when god is moving sometimes he take his time but what you see in the end result is that he get exalted hallelujah all the way up to the right hand with pharaoh and not just resulted to be a figurehead but he gets positionally placed so that he can be a great blessing to his people in their greatest harmony sometimes we don't understand the long-term process of god we don't understand why we had to take that knife straight into the back of it because joseph got backstabbed not just one time but it was more than one time hallelujah we don't understand why we got to go down into the pit where we got to fight the mind battles why we got to go through these different things but the plan of god is long term if you are an adopted son of god you are going to go into the position that he has placed you within and the position that he's placed with it it is a perfect position and it won't just be a blessing to you but it'll be something that all the families of earth will be blessed and amen because you are a child of the wrong seed of abraham and just by you showing up there's gonna be a blessing hallelujah it might be some trouble but god will exalt you in due time amen all the great characters are in the bible amen they moved in the move of god it was up and down but god took care of him amen hallelujah amen you know when you look at the story of moses and how he was born into the family that he was born into but god knew that those people needed a deliverer and he allah it said like the devil said but i got him now i'm gonna have all the kids be killed off guys i got something i pull out my back pocket imma let him be raised up in pharaoh's own household the plan of god is so different it's so long turned to anything that we can conceive as humans amen the plan of god how you allow roof to be a moabitess and seemingly she would have just stayed in her homeland found another husband and been all right the guy said no my plans are so long term my plans are so different something stood up within her a move a man would have been for ruth to just stay in her homeland say what was going on but you know she saw god in her mother-in-law naomi she heard the stories about how there was a god in israel and she said you know i want to see something about that same god asian naomi tell them a roof you stay with your homeland rule said no where you go i'll go amen hallelujah amen your god will be my god amen your people are be my people when you die i'll die and you know god being a rewarder of faith god said i can work with a faith like that amen and you know maybe ruth didn't even understand why she was gonna go all the way but naomi like that but god knew the whole time that in the land of israel there was a kinsmen redeemer by the name of a boy and this brother by the name of boaz he had more than enough power to redeem each and everything that roof had already lost amen to roof went from just gleaning in the fields because maybe somebody thought okay well she got into israel and god blessed him about her being able to glean the little stuff that's left in the field no roof on the whole field she had to clean no more that time was up she was married to the man that on the field saint hallelujah our time for gleaning is over we are married to the one that owns the feeling man roof ain't getting overnight it was a long process for ruth to get there but when she got there her bloodline ran all the way down amen to jesus christ amen all the way down through joseph they could trace back the bloodline again because god's plan is long term when god has blessed you amen to to be able to recognize him amen and being able to recognize his move says that's a great blessing don't don't be put up by people point for what that's man doing and man said that a man said that no we line up with the scripture and the scripture shows us that it's a move of god amen and anytime you're moving with the things of god he is rewarded those people amen moving with the move for god it's going to give you a body change saints back home we've been preaching on the rapture moving with the move of god it's going to take the people of god up into the ultimate goal late man which is rap man we're just going all night man but we just getting caught up with things hey man and he'll take us all the way up in the air whatever you do you stick with the move of god amen you don't got the backup from it you don't got to be ashamed of it if you stand for god he will stand for you amen you move with him he'll move with you in this hour man i'm going to love the lord tonight hallelujah let's just buy his tonight father god lord we just grateful tonight lord lord it wasn't nothing but our own eyesight about on doing father god but you place a severe finish from before the foundation of the world that will be able to catch you moving father god in a time lord where the world seemingly has missed you completely lost you have allowed some people to catch the revelation lord and to be caught up by the revelation lord man i own human minds in our own future mindset lord may that never get in the way of what you're doing father god lord when we came into you lord you gave us a new mind and that is the mind of christ lord we thank you for that lord we thank you for the authority that that gives us dear god that we never have to back up from a challenge of the enemy law because we know whose authority that we have father god we thank you lord we give you the praise and glory for lord we thank you for the people lord that just said so patiently tonight lord lord you are a good god to your people father god and i pray that you continue to reward them with the double force lord may you bless the pastor lord the ministers officers of the church lord and each and every body of believers here lord in the local assembly law we thank you in the love the name of jesus christ may the saints say amen hallelujah amen do you love them tonight man hallelujah lord to god amen how many glad that he caught you up with the move that he's doing right now amen hallelujah i came to give god the glory for the glory all the glory yes i came to give god the glory [Music] so [Music] good so good he has been so he's been so good so so good so he has been so good [Music] [Music] hallelujah well i came to shout hallelujah well he has been so good to well he's been so good so good [Music] so good he has been so he's been so good so good [Music] he has been so good too how many can you tell lord i love you well i came to say lord i love you oh lord i'd love lord i love you lord i love you well i came to say lord i he has been he has been so good [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's been so good so good he has been so good to me i know that victory is mine victory is my war victory today yes well i don't say that i talk who what i get victory victory today you better claim your peace tonight peace is my peace of mind i know peace oh peace today is [Music] [Music] when i rose this morning i didn't have no doubt i knew that the lord would bring me out oh when i got down on my knees i said lord help me please and i gotta sing and shout at victory victoria's victory is my oh victory i know of victory today well i told satan god bless you saints hey man you appreciate the word tonight amen what we need more than anything is spiritual discernment how many believe that tonight you know i was ministering on sunday on i am showing how god you know he's identified by his characteristics and when he first declared what his name was he said i am so what he was what he was about to show them he would be throughout all time the healing the signs the wonders come on he says i am and and what he was like said what he was gonna show them he would always be and so that's why many times in the scriptures i looked at how gideon when the angel came to him he said well if god be with us then then where is all his miracles come on we said is it of god or is it a man if it's of god we know his characteristics then we know that these signs shall follow what them that believe so if it's of god and where is the supernatural it can't be of god without the supernatural how many believe that tonight but that's what it takes i believe the only way we're going to not be deceived is going to have to be the holy ghost in us leading us and guiding us you know he says the holy ghost when he come he was going to teach us all things come on and i believe that i depend on that because i know that in this world so dark and like the brother i'm already saying night so deceptive there's no way that we'll be able to find our way the only way we'll be to find our way is god is going to have to take us by hand i like that scripture how jesus talked about the good shepherd he said he said that he stands at the door come on and he says that he knows all the sheep by name that's the good shepherd said he called them and he leadeth them out come on i said did you hear the call tonight well if you heard the call you don't have to go on your own god is going to lead you out how many believe that tonight but what it takes is it of god like you said or is it a man you know i was saying the other day what it is i like how brother maurice is bringing out but you got to have a personal experience i says what it is as an individual you know just hearing the word or just saying i believe ain't enough because when storms come trials tribulations things hit your life you got nothing to anchor you but you need a personal experience i said what it is i've been praying i said god you got to do something supernatural in individuals lives i thought about moses in the burning bush i thought about paul seeing the light i thought about so many ways what it was one day god showed up didn't he that woman at the well he showed up didn't he and he did something supernatural that when they caught hold to it their lives were never the same nobody could talk them out of it nobody could shake them away from it because they were anchored not in just uh like to say the letter killeth but they had the spirit that came and it quickened the word come on and it brought the life so it's no longer that they were just reading the word the letter of the word but the life of the word had come now so when they read it it's something about the life of it now came and then you know it was a change then and i believe that with all of my heart and i pray that even today for our young people for our children all what it is we can preach the word but i said god you got to do something supernatural for him you got to come down i said god do what you always done if god be with us then where are all his miracles god you know we we know we know what you're capable of lord and we won't rest until we we get what you what you're capable of how many want to do that tonight how many believe that tonight amen so and that's what it is we don't just warm by painted fire and all those things but we look for god to do supernatural things you know we look for him to be who he always was he said i am that that's who i am that's what my name is you tell him that i am come on i like how in revelation he said he that was and which is and which is to come come on the almighty the alpha and omega the first and the last come on god don't change i know that the world is is the way it is now and like he says in this age we got to live by faith and all those things but you know one thing about god god don't change come on nothing can't stop god from when god want to move when god want to heal nothing can't stop god from healing when god want to save nothing can't stop god from saving god can do whatever he wants whenever he wants but y'all believe that tonight so i'm stirred are you stirred tonight amen let's preach let's get a lord hand clapper praise amen come on is it of god or is it a man let us bow our heads once again heavenly father lord we thank you tonight for your grace lord and using our brother maurice lord to give us the word tonight lord and so many things that were said lord god i just pray lord that as mary took these things and she pondered them in her heart god i pray tonight that we can take the word lord and that it had fallen on good ground and god we could take it home and ponder on these things and oh god hear what the spirit is saying god i thank you tonight lord i pray that you would continue to bless our brother maurice lord and his family and his ministry god bless him god abundantly above all he could ask a thing bless your children here tonight lord as we depart this place but never your presence i pray that the angels of god might go in front of us lord and god that your anointing your quickening power might keep us in the way father for we thank you and lord we love you with all our hearts in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen [Music] so you
