night let us pray Heavenly Father notice again we come before thy presence before that throne looking unto you who is the author and finisher of our faith Lord no matter what's going on in the world today Lord we'll be standing in the sacred place and began to exalt your name nothing matters then because we know we have a hope but if only hope we all men most miserable and we want to thank you tonight from the depths of our soul that you look upon us to say such a wretched sinner like me in the pardoning grace of your blood we thank you tonight we praise you tonight for your love and your mercy upon a sinner like I we likes you to forgive us of all sins and all flesh let it be removed that your spirit might have preeminence tonight that you would get glory and praise and that you would be lifted up above the heavens bless and anoint your word bless and anoint your people thank you Lord for the bride of Jesus Christ we love you now commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ name as we stand tonight the book of Mark 11 mark 11 and 25 and it reads and when he and when ye stand praying forgive if you have all against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you of your stress passes but if you do not forgive neither where your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses Romans 8 and 28 and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify it who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us when the Lord had a blessing to the region I was afraid you may be seated I thought tonight pardon pardon / approved pardoned and approved as you looking at mark here he said forgive your brother ins of their trespasses and when you forgive don't carry it with you we look at pardon it said the action of forgiving or being forgiven the action of forgiving or being forgiven for an error or an offence Oh clemency mercy remission passing over offence without punishment so when pardon when your sins are pardoned you've been forgiven and God passed over the pardon of his Greece by the blood of Jesus Christ and it released you from a penalty or an obligation if you was released from a penalty or an obligation that's why the book of Romans says in 1828 said we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God and to them that are called according to his purpose so if God tonight God tonight as pardon your sins the Bible says in Romans 8 and 33 says who should lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify it so as we look at the pardoning of God's grace and maybe we look into prove see once you have been pardoned by His grace as Paul says in first Corinthians I didn't come to you with excellency of speech or men wisdom and knowing anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified so if you truly pardon tonight then the mercy and the crucified Savior Christ will be in you you know heard the prophet of God said that it's young man that was left his post of duty and they wanted to kill him it was during the time of war and he left his post of duty and it was going to execute him and his best friend went to Abraham Lincoln and said his son his friend didn't mean any harm and it kind of struck my heart inspiration say didn't mean any harm that could you write him a pardon that he could be free and Abraham Lincoln had his briefcase and he wrote on a piece of paper not the US United States and let her head but just wrote on a piece of paper pardon and his friend took it back to him in the jail cell and he said why you come to mock me because of that it ain't come from the president so tonight if we look at this as our pardon in Greece many would take the Bible and would throw it away but we look at the scriptures as our pardon and grace of Isaiah 53 says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our Nicky to chastise our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are here so when we accept a pardon in Greece of the blood of Jesus then your sins have been remitted don't let the devil take you back to him they have been remitted into the blood of Jesus and you've been pardoned and it should be a sacrifice crucified Savior in sorry showing that you say they've been pardoned Michael 7 Mike a 7 and 18 and it says who is it God like unto thee that partner the iniquity and passes by the transgressions of the remnant of his heritage he retained not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy so when you look at the pardoning of God's grace he ain't gonna hold his yo sins against you you know sometimes we can see it every day or do things wrong or say something wrong every day but the cause of that pardon in Greece of that blood that was shed at Calvary God looks over our sins and he will return he returned again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities he and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea see God will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea now when you look at pardon it's something that you have to accept you have to accept the pardoning grace of Jesus and Paul was looking at the Corinthians and Paul said because of your life you said you loved God but because of your life you haven't officially accepted God's pardon and grace because you took the chance at some place to plead or some Priester to live any kind of way but when you accept a pardon and grace of the blood of Jesus Christ and it goes beyond your intellect it goes down into the very depths of your heart then now your sins have been pardoned and now you're waiting to be approved Exodus 23 Exodus 23 and 20 behold I send mine angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring the into the police whether I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoked not him see when the angel the Lord or when the Spirit of the Lord trying to lead you in the right way sometimes we don't listen at the Spirit of God when your pardon the grace of God God sent an angel sending spirit to you and try to keep you in the right way even if you come into the baptism of the Holy Ghost or you have the Holy Ghost and you ain't really understanding how that the spirit moves in your life and the way things go in your life and leading by the spirit of being led by the spirit the Bible said they that are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God the prodigal said many people have the Spirit of God but they're not led correctly they will still want to do what they want to do but we got to continually surrender to his sovereign grace and His mercy we read something here I was reading from Andrew Murray the worship of the father is only to those to whom the Spirit of the son has been given the worship in spirit is only possible to those whom the son has revealed a father and who have received the spirit of sonship we read it again the worship of the father is only possible to those to whom the spirit of the son has been given and the worship in the spirit is only possible to those to whom the son has revealed the father who have proceeded the spirit of sonship now st. John says in John st. John 14 and 20 said at that day you should know that I'm in the father and the father in me and I in you and you in me so there must be a perfect oneness of Jesus Christ in you not you saying he's in you but he's recognizing that he's in you not just you saying it but the manifestation of the Spirit of God in you showing that the pardon in Greece and what I like Sarita by pardoning is that when you receive a genuine pardoning of His grace there's a certain humility in a certain contrite spirit that goes along with it that says I am dead now I am dead now and I'm looking to be approved I'm looking for God's pardon and grace and I'm looking to be approved by God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that brings a certain humility that the power of the Resurrection leads you and directs you and God I by your grease you've accepted his pardon by the blood and you accept His Holy Ghost by the blood of Calvary and that blood should be so deep in our hearts to a point that God saved me a sinner saved by grace from somewhere that nobody know even knows the town I'm from but God saved me by His grace and I'm so indebted to God nothing I see nothing I look at can turn me away from the blood of Jesus because he saved me when I was unsavable he pardon my sins when it was unpardonable but by His mercy and grace he said I'm gonna save you because I know you would be destinated as Romans 8:28 says all things work together for the good tell them that love God he gave me an opportunity to love me by putting it Zini me that I would love it and then gave me pardon and grace by the blood that was shed at Calvary not the chemistry of the blood but the very life that was in that chemistry the very life comes back on a believer that's what Andrew Murray was saying that the son has revealed not intellectually but down in the heart has revealed to you the very substance of God now is in your heart so now you are manifestation of the unveiling of Christ not Jesus but Christ if we would be Jesus maybe another God but the unveiling of Christ which is the Anointed One Christ in us is the Anointed One Exodus 23 and 20 I sent mine angel to prepare the way beware of him and obey him said beware of him that angel beware of him that angel of the Covenant that angel is a spirit beware of the angel and obey his voice provoke him not for he was not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then will I then will then I will be an enemy to thine enemies and an adversary to thine adversaries for mine angel shall go before thee and bring thee into the into the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the Canaanites and that he rides in the Jebusites and I will cut them off God gonna cut these nations off from you if you follow the angel thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break them break down their images any images that don't want you to be humble any images that don't want you to be humble in pardoning of God's grace anything that takes you out from the word if a spirit comes and it doesn't take you back to the word then it's another spirit Paul said in Galatians if another angel come and preach anything different than what I preach please let him be a curse it must be with the Word of God what a word of God is the power is it he'll keep you from no enemies he will guide and direct you if you gonna keep you in the way that he infects you amen but some people just refuse to obey some people just refuse to obey what they ain't you say Nehemiah they just refused to do what the Angels say and sometimes they think danger just a man but the Angels the Spirit of the Lord the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost that's in you that's the angel that's leading you he led the children of Israel a cloud by day a pillar of fire by night the Angel of the Covenant is the Spirit of God in you once she received the Holy Ghost inside of you that is leading you st. John 14:26 said the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he gonna lead you into all things we're not glorifying nobody but Jesus he's gonna send that angel in the name of Jesus and he when you see that that the Spirit of God is inside of you he's leading directing and guiding you to approval Nehemiah 917 and refused to obey neither were mindful of the wonders that dark God did us among them but hardened their necks and then hardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage but the Artic God ready to pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and of a great and of great kindness and forsook them not yay and when they made themselves a golden calf and said is this is that God that brought us up out of the land up out of Egypt and have wrought great profit provocations yet thou in the manifold mercies see God had mercy God had manifold mercies forsook them not in the wilderness see his manner for mercy did enforcer community where they build a golden Calvin put the gold and all the kind of stuff and God did not forsake them but in his manifold mercies forsook them not in the wilderness and the pillar of cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither did the pillar of fire by night to show them light the way wherein they should go so God because of his sovereign grace and His mercy he didn't feel suck them his manifold mercy his manifold love but so I'm gonna say I love him I'm never gonna forget what he done for me I'm never gonna forget what Jesus done for me no matter how people treat me on their job no matter how people treat me at their church no matter how people treat me in my family I'm not gonna forget what Jesus done for me and if you were one of them people tonight your department grace of God's mercy is with you because though he slay me I'll trust him whatever he do I just want to be with him because of his mercy and because of His grace let's go to Psalms to 1:21 you know some people's well I'm just gonna do what I want to do fine you know it's getting to the point not a virus and all this stuff I ain't got no more trust in God but I'm just gonna trust it I'm a trusting though he slay me I'm gonna trust him no matter what he do me I'm gonna I'm gonna trust him because I'm heating I mean his hands I'd rather be in the hands of man than in the hands of God than in the hands of man and if you're in the hands of God and you trust him I'm I'm persuaded tonight as Paul says in enrollments I'm persuaded tonight that he'll keep that with you committed unto Him he'll do what you need tonight it might not come when you want it but God is gonna be their own time and he's gonna he don't have a slack here like man God but God says not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but all should come to repentance all should come to repentance repent and be converted that your sins may be blotted out in the times of refreshing just to come from the Lord and he just said who Jesus Psalms 1 21 I got to the point I need these things now brothers tear me to get a bigger Bible bigger writing but I got the hold on I would lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved so your foot in will be moved he shall keep he that keepeth thee will not slumber behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep the Lord is thy keeper so you can't keep yourself if you think you can keep yourself you're in bad shape and you will see after a while you will see I throw odd that you can't keep yourself the Lord is your keeper he is your keeping you got the lead you could divine trust in him Lord you can keep me when I can't keep myself Israel shall not slumber nor sleep the Lord is my keeper the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand the Sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time even forevermore see he's our keeper tonight and because he has pardoned your sins tonight when your sins is truly pardoned it's the word of Jesus Christ it's the word of Lord the Lord in hell is hold into your heart in such a way that no matter how I'm treated or whatever you know I look at the boogie in the Bible Peter said Lord how much how many times shall my brother offend me and I forgive him seven times seven and Peter said Lord increase my faith but he says seventy times seven 490 times in a day that that brother offended but if you look back at the pardoning grace of Jesus and you look back at Chowdhury see we look back to Calvary and the Old Testament look to Calvary we look back to Calvary and see what the blood done it's all right to forgive then because of I didn't help forgiving grace inside of me pardon and grace inside of me I couldn't pardon that sin but because he had pardoned my sins I can pardon their sins because I know I wasn't nobody to be saved but he saved me beyond measure he saved me beyond my condition and I can look over that condition that much that God might be the righteousness in me that God might be the righteousness in me the Hebrew boys I didn't mean to be too long the Hebrew boys approved in Daniel 3 and 12 through 30 the lost son approved in Luke 15 and 11 through 23 Lazarus approved in John 11 and 25 and 41 through 44 Jesus approved a man approved of God in acts 2 in 22 that Bible said by wicked hands have been crucified and slain and Lord of glory whom God raised from the dead Cornelius a just man waiting for the consolation of Israel acts 10 and 1 approved a man at the cross pardoned in Luke 23 and 42 and 43 Paul pardoning acts 9 and one approved in Galatians 1 in 11 through 15 Jonah pardoned in Jonah two and one who went to the ship to go to Tarsus approved in Jonah 3 and 4 to 7 David approved in 1st Samuel 16 and 5 through 16 that's why he made the brothers pass before him and he said now this is the one of knowing him he pardoned he approved in Daniels I mean second sent Samuel 16 and 5 through 6 to 12 and his sin was pardoned in 2nd Samuel 12 and 1 his sins were pardoned when he went with Bathsheba Peter approved in acts 2 and 1 the blind man pardoned in Matthew 20 and 29 Tamar and Judah pardoning in Genesis 38 and 14 the 12 patriarchs pardoned in Genesis 45 1 through 7 the sins were pardoned because they sold a brother they sold a brother and they left him in a ditch and they killed a kid and they put the blood on him and brought the coat back to Jake Joseph they brought the coat back to Jacob their father instead of animal wild animal heads community oh nice of us pardoned by Philemon approved by Paul Hannah pardoned in first Sami a one-in-ten where Eli I thought she was drunk but she said I'm a man a woman of a sorrowful spirit Isaiah 40 and one Israel is pardoned in 40 and one when he sent John the Baptist the voice of one crying in the wilderness Israel pardoned iniquity is pardoned it a man Ephesians 1:7 Ephesians one in seven in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he have abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will see the mystery of his will when he pardoned us by his blood the mystery of approval in his will was that you might receive the pardoning grace of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and been approved by God having made known see as I read in Andrew Murray those that receive his spirit and they enter into sonship so you must enter in the sonship by his spirit and he's made known unto us see without the spirit nothing can be made known to you but with the spirit that devil deed is made known and the righteous acts of God is now being planted in your spirit in your soul now all you want to do is the will of God and know what the word said I know the proper God he said on many occasions he the bride knows what he will done with the word and the only way she can know is that the same spirit that growling Jesus driving her Roma's evening lover that spirit must be in you and it'll quicken your mortal bodies not just for the rapture but a click in your body to the revelation of making known the mystery of Israel not in intellect but in the power of the Resurrection tippy-toes others want to get more knowledge knowledge is buffered up but charity never satisfied I want the revelation of the mystery of the anointed making known to me the mystery it must be made known until that you are deceived having made known until having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself so if the bride is in Jesus then the mysteries in you all he doing is making it known to you because you have a spirit that in a dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ so I say you couldn't be another Jesus but you could be Christ Christ means The Anointed One I teach down at the church in Camden the Lord is God Jesus is son in the church ages and Christ is in you now which is the hope of glory that's why John 14:26 had a cover which is the Holy Ghost their father goes sending me my name now didn't name her father son Holy Ghost not in the name of rose of Sharon he could send me in the name of Jesus because that's what redemption is in the name of Jesus that's why Paul said in acts 2 36 therefore let all the house of Israel know it surely that God had made the same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ so if he made him both Lord and Christ so Christ is the anointed inside of you both Lord and Christ when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter in the rest of the past men and brethren what shall we do he said repent repent means to be godly sorry that your father's might be remitted repent be godless sorry repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you until your children is about fall even as many as the Lord our God shall call and I'm thankful tonight that he called me but not only don't just let him call you let him justify not only justify you let him sanctify you not only sanctify you let it fill you with the Holy Ghost and let the very life of Jesus Christ resume inside of you that you are walking tangible substance tabernacle of the very God that walked only serve 2000 years ago in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated a to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own wheel after the counsel of his own will see if you wiii in his wheel tonight you in his word that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of your inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory wherefore I also after I heard the word of a heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints see now this is a person not talking to him now people just read over the scripture but just read the scripture what the scripture is really singing wherefore I also heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love of all these things so you got love for all these things can't hate nobody there's not a heat bone in you cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers how you love everybody pray for everybody that's how you keep love I'm praying for him brother Nathan praying for him that's how you develop love because your sins have been pardoned you preform pastor the children the family their wife their ministries everybody Lord bless them all and when you pray for one another not just oh not just calling words but I'm talking agonizing prayer that develops love you know I say this my wife so don't

Christ now you've been approved that love now you interceding with the father your love is now anchoring in with the father I want no less for brother Kayla then I want for CJ is that all that is it love Josh ain't even you I you said I'm saying it's just a rate Rachel no she's mine hey she ain't gotta worry about Rachel but you said I'm saying the love has to be great and the only way it can be great is that we must be pardoned and approved I got too much than that or more clothes in there Colossians 3 and imma close Colossians 3 in 1 3 and 13 forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even if Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body be therefore thankful see if you called in the body and you know you've been pardoned and approved just be thankful you in the body people getting the body I'm

body by the spirit and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which also ye are called in one body be therefore thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and
