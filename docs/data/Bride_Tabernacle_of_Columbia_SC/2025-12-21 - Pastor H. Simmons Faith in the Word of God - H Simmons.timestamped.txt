[35:26] repeat it. Now, faith is the substance
[35:29] of things hoped for and the evidence of
[35:31] things not seen. One more time. Now
[35:35] faith is the substance of things hoped
[35:37] for and the evidence of things not seen.
[35:42] Got it. How many of you learned it?
[35:49] Tell me y'all didn't I said Sunday
[35:51] morning y'all supposed to know it.
[35:54] Okay, one more time. Maybe y'all get it.
[35:57] Now faith is the substance of things
[35:59] hoped for and evidence of things not
[36:02] seen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now,
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; That's very important.
[36:11] Amen. That now faith is Okay.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; So, we were talking about faith in the
[36:16] word of God. Amen.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; The reason why we said faith in the word
[36:20] of God. Now uh go back to uh where we
[36:24] were
[36:26] talking uh concerning
[36:29] Romans 10. Faith come by hearing
[36:34] &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[36:41] So faith come if faith come by hearing
[36:44] and hear the word of God. It said,
[36:48] "How then shall they they call on him?"
[36:51] The 14th verse of Romans 10 and 14. How
[36:56] shall they?
[36:59] How then shall they call
[37:03] on him whom they have not believed? And
[37:06] how shall they believe in him whom they
[37:10] have not what?
[37:12] And how shall they hear without a what?
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Preacher.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Preacher.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Let's just read on. For now, for how
[37:26] shall they preach except they be what?
[37:30] &gt;&gt; As it is written, how beautiful are the
[37:32] feet of them which preach the gospel of
[37:35] peace and bring glad tidings of good
[37:38] things. But they have not all obeyed the
[37:44] gospel. For Isaiah or Eel said, Lord,
[37:48] who has what?
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Believe our report.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; So then what?
[37:56] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; So you got another scripture you going
[37:59] you're going to remember.
[38:02] Romans 10:17.
[38:05] So then faith cometh by what?
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Hearing. and hearing what?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; By the word of God.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Faith in the word of God. Now,
[38:16] how can you hear without a preacher? And
[38:18] how can he preach God sent him? Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; A lot of people preaching,
[38:25] right?
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; But if God sent them, they're going to
[38:28] speak God's word.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. They not they're not they're
[38:33] not being dictated to by man, but
[38:36] they're going to preach God's word.
[38:38] Amen.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, uh, a lot of people have been
[38:43] called by the church.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; They've been called by a denomination.
[38:50] But if God called them and God sent
[38:52] them, they're going to preach the word.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Preach the word. Preach it in
[39:00] season, out of season." Amen.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Another, it's very important. I I won't
[39:06] read that, but maybe we will. Let's just
[39:10] go to Deuter Romans 8.
[39:18] God is good. Amen.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; It's
[39:23] It's holiday time and people taking
[39:27] their holiday off,
[39:29] &gt;&gt; but thank God you're here.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. I'm so glad I'm here.
[39:34] Amen.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus. Are you glad to be here?
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm in the number.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[39:48] You said uh Deuter Romans 8.
[39:52] I hope Kale with me. He said,
[39:55] go ahead on. I'll let you do some
[39:57] reading. Okay.
[39:59] 8 and one.
[40:02] All the commandments which I command
[40:04] thee this day shall ye observe to do
[40:08] that ye may live and multiply and go in
[40:11] and possess the land which the Lord
[40:12] swear unto your fathers. And thou shalt
[40:16] remember all the way which the Lord thy
[40:18] God led thee these 40 years in the
[40:21] wilderness to humble thee and to prove
[40:24] thee to know what was in thine heart,
[40:27] whether thou wouldest keep his
[40:29] commandments or no. See, God, they went
[40:32] through the wilderness for 40 years, and
[40:35] God wanted to see whether or not you
[40:36] going to keep his commandments. And he
[40:38] wanted to humble you. Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes things come in our lives, and
[40:43] God is trying to get our attention,
[40:45] trying to get us to be humble enough,
[40:47] amen, to recognize what he's doing.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, cuz sometime we don't know
[40:52] how good God is and what where God, you
[40:55] know, he he bought us a long way, but
[40:57] sometime we don't recognize and give him
[40:59] thanks for what he done.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; And we need to thank God for bringing us
[41:05] through another year.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Thank him. Amen. Because this is the
[41:10] this is THIS IS WHAT GOD has done for
[41:12] us. And if HE KEPT YOU WELL AND KEPT YOU
[41:15] IN your right mind, you ought to be ABLE
[41:17] TO SAY, "LORD, I THANK YOU for another
[41:19] year."
[41:21] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. YOU'VE BEEN GOOD TO ME,
[41:23] LORD.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; YOU ALLOWED ME TO SEE ANOTHER YEAR.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; And you kept me.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "He didn't have to do it,
[41:33] but he did." And I'm so glad he did.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm glad not to be in pain
[41:39] this morning.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz I've been in a lot of pain lately.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; You see, praise God. How many you ever
[41:47] had a toothache? Some of y'all ain't
[41:49] never had one.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; You ever had a toothache? Then just
[41:54] imagine what kind of pain I've been in.
[41:56] I ain't had no toothache now.
[41:58] I'd rather go get it pulled than me
[42:00] having a toothache. [laughter]
[42:03] But by the grace of God, but but th
[42:05] those pains that I've been in for a
[42:08] couple of weeks, it seems like I'd
[42:11] rather have a toothache
[42:13] than to go through those pains. But by
[42:15] the grace of God, God is good.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; And I can stand here and say, "Thank
[42:19] you, Lord."
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I I didn't get upset with
[42:23] God. I just had to go through some
[42:25] things.

[48:36] takes care of you if you only let him.
[48:40] If you let go and let God have his way
[48:42] in your life. See, sometimes we're
[48:45] holding on to like we we don't want to
[48:48] lose control. You know what? We get on
[48:51] the airplane and is way up in the air
[48:53] and you know what the pilot do?

[49:35] this car, man. Hold on." He said, "Man,
[49:38] [laughter]
[49:38] it'll be all right. Daddy, it going to
[49:41] be all right. The car going to go."
[49:44] Praise God.
[49:46] But some of us afraid to get in one of
[49:48] those cars, sit back and relax and say,
[49:51] "I want to go so and so." Huh?
[49:56] Yeah, you don't trust it.
[50:00] Fred Junior said, "Uhuh.

[50:11] coming.
[50:13] You You understand what I'm saying? Some
[50:16] of these children to jump in and just
[50:18] ride."
[50:20] But some of us, oh, we have second
[50:23] thoughts on jumping in. But if they can
[50:27] trust the automatic pilot in the sky,
[50:34] how about you trusting God with your
[50:36] life?
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to let go and let God be
[50:40] in control?
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have faith in God's word and say,
[50:45] "Lord, Amen. I have faith and confidence
[50:48] in your word and I'm letting go. I'mma
[50:51] let your word work it out.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; You can take me to my destination where

[51:16] HAVE IT, LORD, THEN MAKE ME WHAT YOU
[51:18] WANT ME TO DO BE.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU TAKE [screaming] CONTROL. AMEN.

[51:29] And like I said, Caleb, get that wheel,
[51:31] man.
[51:35] You know, you going to run this curve.
[51:38] You better do something. It look like I
[51:40] I ain't trusting that around this curve
[51:42] now. I mean, you know, you're going in
[51:44] the curb in the, you know, it's supposed
[51:47] to keep you. Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Are y'all with me?
