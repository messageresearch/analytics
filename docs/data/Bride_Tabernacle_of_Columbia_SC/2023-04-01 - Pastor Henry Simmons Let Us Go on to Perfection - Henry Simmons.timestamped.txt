[34:04] just pray for the Saints death let us
[34:06] just stand tonight
[34:18] okay let us your smile
[34:21] father we thank you Lord God
[34:25] for just blessing us tonight to come
[34:27] together
[34:28] in the name of Jesus Christ
[34:31] the Lord you paid the price and
[34:33] we thank you for paying the price
[34:36] dying for our sins and
[34:39] and father God forgiven us oh God for
[34:41] all our shortcomings
[34:44] my Lord may you bless your word may you
[34:46] bless every heart that have come
[34:48] God may you strengthen your people Lord
[34:51] those that desire to be here that
[34:53] couldn't make it those that have made it
[34:55] Lord I pray God that you speak a word in
[34:58] season
[34:59] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[35:02] amen
[35:03] Hebrews 6
[35:08] in a world where it's so much
[35:11] confusion and chaos
[35:15] the prophet speaker spoke a message be
[35:18] certain of God
[35:20] and I I said we need to be certain
[35:24] we don't need to be
[35:27] done at this particular hour
[35:30] so as we were speaking on adoption
[35:33] and uh
[35:34] we continued on with that but we talk
[35:37] about let us go on to perfection
[35:39] it's time to go on it's time to stop
[35:42] going around in circles it's time to get
[35:45] a hold of God in a real way
[35:48] in a way where we're getting results in
[35:51] our lives
[35:53] where God is getting to be more real to
[35:56] us
[35:57] and we feel ourselves growing and
[35:59] getting closer to him
[36:01] so it's time for us to
[36:03] get up the lungs of our mind and
[36:06] and go on let's just not stand still
[36:08] let's go on
[36:10] because I know sometimes there's things
[36:12] that can hinder you things that could uh
[36:15] stop you and
[36:17] startle you
[36:18] trip you
[36:20] and things that can cause you to not
[36:25] move forward
[36:26] but let us go on he says here
[36:30] therefore leaving the principles of the
[36:33] doctrine of Christ
[36:34] let us go on to perfection
[36:37] not land again the foundation of
[36:40] repentance from dead works
[36:43] and Faith towards God
[36:47] and of the doctrine of baptism and of
[36:49] the land on our hands and of the
[36:51] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[36:54] judgment
[36:55] and this is what we do if God permits
[36:59] God bless you I'm not going to get into
[37:02] the next versions
[37:05] I thought it was impossible for those
[37:07] that once enlightened
[37:09] amen
[37:13] and have tasted of the Heavenly gift
[37:15] and we're partakers of the Holy Ghost
[37:19] and have tasted of the good word of God
[37:22] and the power of the world to come
[37:24] if they shall fall away
[37:29] if they shall fall away
[37:31] to renew them again to repentance
[37:34] seeing They Crucified to themselves the
[37:37] son of God afresh
[37:39] and put him to open shame
[37:43] so by the grace of God we want to just
[37:46] deal with that first verse let us go on
[37:49] to perfection
[37:51] because
[37:53] like I say it's things that
[37:57] come before us and things that hinder
[38:00] and start the growth of the people of
[38:02] God
[38:04] so oftentimes we try to go forward
[38:07] but we're stunted in our growth
[38:10] because
[38:11] the enemy is there to hinder you to
[38:15] resist you to try to keep you from
[38:17] moving forward
[38:19] now Hebrews 2
[38:23] and nine
[38:28] it says
[38:33] but we see Jesus
[38:35] who was made a little Lord and angels
[38:39] for the suffering of death crying with
[38:41] Glory and Honor
[38:43] that he by the grace of God should taste
[38:46] death for every man
[38:48] I want you to look at Jesus and what he
[38:50] did to us for us
[38:52] for in the temporary it became him for
[38:56] whom are all things and by whom all
[38:58] things and bringing many sons into glory
[39:01] to make the captain of their salvation
[39:03] what
[39:05] perfect
[39:06] the temp first perfect through what
[39:09] suffering
[39:11] we talk about let's go into Perfection
[39:13] we want to be perfect
[39:16] our desires to be perfect
[39:19] and in this age
[39:21] that the prophet spoke on the Statue of
[39:23] a perfect man
[39:25] and we know Hebrews I mean Matthew
[39:28] tells us to be perfect as your father
[39:30] which is in heaven is perfect
[39:33] now God is not looking for a church with
[39:36] excuses
[39:37] he's looking for perfection
[39:40] he said let us go on to perfection
[39:43] now the revelation of the word and the
[39:45] opening of The Seven Seals and God sent
[39:48] in a prophet to come down
[39:50] not for us to stay
[39:53] in our nomination of thoughts and our
[39:55] ideas
[39:57] but to go into the land
[40:01] to lead us Cross Jordan
[40:04] when we come out of mystery Babylon God
[40:06] wants us to go on not just to come out
[40:09] but to go in
[40:12] go into the promises go into the
[40:14] blessings
[40:15] so the prophet was to come to introduce
[40:19] us
[40:21] to the revealed word of the hour
[40:23] to Jesus Christ
[40:27] the word
[40:29] that God
[40:31] wanted us to manifest for our day
[40:34] we live in
[40:36] everybody else was in people in other
[40:40] ages
[40:41] God went that ignorance
[40:43] but now he's calling every man
[40:45] everywhere to come to a repentance
[40:48] so we have
[40:50] clarification on the word
[40:54] amen we're not to add to the word we're
[40:56] not to take away from the word
[40:58] praise God
[40:59] but God's holding us accountable
[41:03] we're gonna be accountable for much
[41:06] giving as much required
[41:09] God wants us to go on to Perfection
[41:11] there's no excuses now
[41:15] I think
[41:17] that there's more excuses in it and
[41:20] those that call themselves The Bride
[41:22] than in any other people
[41:24] with all the word
[41:26] and the church being set in order
[41:29] for rapture
[41:31] Rapture in faith
[41:33] Faith come by here and here and by the
[41:35] word of God
[41:38] by faith in Egypt was what

[1:03:41] I say you don't use it you lose it
[1:03:45] use
[1:03:47] and that's why you know
[1:03:49] it's because we're not exercising
[1:03:52] ourselves in Godly stuff

[1:03:58] you gotta you know we go to the gym we
[1:04:01] get out and exercise try to eat right
[1:04:03] and do right amen because we want to be

[1:04:36] reason of use have their senses
[1:04:40] exercised to what
[1:04:43] to discern
[1:04:45] both Good and Evil
