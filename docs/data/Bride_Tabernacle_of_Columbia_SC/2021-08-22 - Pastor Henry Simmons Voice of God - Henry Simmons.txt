doors father thank you thank you for your blessing this morning thank you oh god for these that are gathered to deal those that are listening in father i pray your blessings upon your word in jesus wonderful name we pray amen the book of first samuel three praise god god is good amen you know it's something to have an encounter with god amen if we ever come in contact with him we'll never be the same first samurai three one through ten i'll read the first you'll read the next we'll read the tenth together first samuel three and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision too an error the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep for the lord and he ran into eli and said here am i for thou call it to me and he said i call not lie down again and when and and he went and lied down lay down 6. now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him 8. therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if he calleth thee that thou shall say speak lord and for thou servant here so samuel went and laid down in his place together and the lord came stood and called as yet other times samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for the servant of his may god bless you towards you may be seated the voice of god the voice of god many times god speak but we don't recognize it's him speaking god speaks through you know i was thinking you know sometimes god's voice is not perceived and i i looked at the the the the donkey balaam was riding the voice of god balaam was so intent on doing what he wanted to do that he ignored the voice of god he did not even recognize god was speaking now we he should have you know if all of a sudden the donkey that you're used to riding began to speak you can see how we could be so sad on our intent that we don't recognize that god is speaking when we're driven by our selfish desire and what we want when we're driven by that then when god is speaking sometimes we can't even hear god instead of listening and recognizing that was god speaking through the donkey in other words he wanted to punish the junkie for speaking and somebody comes to you and they said brother and sister you know unbeknown to you they may not have never known what you were intending to do what you were getting ready to embark upon what you were getting ready to go into but they come to you and they say such and such and such and such it and you said you said so many times it it has happened in my life and so many times it happened that god would pre-warn us and he'll tell us don't do this or don't do that but instead of us listening and recognizing it it's not that individual it wasn't a duncan it was god speaking the voice of god but we are so used intent like samuel here he was listening so he was so inspired by eli and he was so accustomed to eli speaking to when god was speaking he thought it was eli speaking you see how how you can be misunderstood you know sometimes it um it could be a the norm we can use used to the norm that when the supernatural begin to uh transpire because we're so used to the norm that when the supernatural begin to come in then we can still think hey hey this is a natural uh a voice calling me but it was a supernatural it was god speaking are you with me this is it's out of the norm god is speaking you know when a minister get behind this pulpit when he gets up to speak when a singer gets up to scene it ought to not be the individual because some people could receive directly from a song directly what they needed they needed to hear that song from god and it's not the you know that individual at that particular time god amen inspired them to sing a certain song they sometimes they are not conscious i i believe that duncan didn't even know what was going on and no doubt samuel was you know he wasn't in tune he didn't know what was going on but god was speaking to him without him having anything to do with it brother sis it's good that we can be used and not even know god is using us sometimes you know you know because sometimes if we knew god was using us sometimes we get a little lifted up you know i can do it god is using me no sometimes god uses us in in such a way that we are unconscious of that sometimes where down the road we recognize hey and somebody will come i've had people come up to me and they said you know god healed me years ago when you prayed for me so and so you know you didn't know that sometimes you've done something to force somebody said something in such a time when a person that at a stage of suicidal experience and all of that but you said something then the person would tell you later on i was at the brink i was just getting ready to take my whole life but you you came and you talked to me on time at the season when i needed it the most when i was getting ready to sometimes folks uh i want you to recognize i said god you know something i don't want to be able to stand here today and you hear that i got a message or something i said god say what you want to say for you know the needs of each and every individual you know what they're going through amen and you know what is needed to be said but if you listen and you hear uh brother simmons speak of minister simmons or bishop simmons or elder symbols or pastor simmons or whatever you want to call it you know but if you listen to that and but if it's something about beyond that behind the scene god is speaking directly to you because uh uh brother simmons does not know amen your situation in your present state of being amen and god can directly speak to you but samuel wasn't perceiving it he just thought it was eli he wasn't preceding and and that's what that is so often that when god is talking it's not preceded we don't know who it is so he like after the third time he says uh samuel i know eli recognized i know i'm not calling him in other words eli proceeded there was the lord talking to the young fellow he said now the next time when you lie down and you hear it again you say speak lord praise god wouldn't you like to have an experience that the lord would speak to you and you know that it's him that's speaking and he says speak lord and i said every individual must have a personal encounter with god without that personal encounter some amen eventually don't want that encounter but everybody wants something even though the deep call it to the deep down inside they're searching they're trying to find out amen my purpose for life where am i going where am i headed what am i trying to accomplish what am i trying to achieve praise god well who knows the path i take who knows my future here job said in job 33 job 33 and 14 he said for god spake once yay twice yet man what oh let me read it again y'all got it now for god spake once yet twice yet man what perceives it not it's something about being able to perceive when god is speaking to understand that god is speaking to us it must come a time when the word of the lord is revealed like it was revealed to samuel god reveals himself to you personally as an individual it's got to come a time a junction in your life the junction you got to be a crossroad it's got to be a time that that junction come amen that you have to make a decision that and when that time he says and god speaks once and god speaks twice and we perceive it not it's time for us to start understanding who's speaking psalms 62 and 11. psalms 62 and 11. oh boy god is good amen he said god has spoken once twice have i heard this that what power what i'll tell you something you know what we you and i ain't you're gonna trust in your own power what kind of power do you have power blown it to god but he he says only god has spoken once so he's trying to get it over god spoke twice the power blown with the god what makes man so so lost it's pathetic it's pitiful that man don't know power belonged to god you don't have no power are you with me that's why jesus said without me you can do nothing you can't do what you think you you know so we trust in our own ability but power belongs to god you don't have no power you up man he said the power to be they are dying of god are you with me i don't care how how strong uh maybe the america russia or whatever power belonging to god i don't care if they got nuclear bomb i don't care they got whatever power belonging to god amen praise god all the might and all the ships and all the planes all of this all power belonging to god amen are you with me god speaks once he speaks twice and he lets you know the power of belonging to god you don't have no strength to do nothing you can't do nothing except god allows it if god don't allow you to get up in the morning you won't get up are you with me if god don't touch you oh god praise god power will blow me to god but balaam was so set in his own attitude in his own little or a way that he's not going to recognize god speaking now you know saint john how do i know god is speaking to me saint john 10 how do i know god is speaking now the voice of god is expressed by the word of god the bible said by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god god said let there be light and there was light what was it god said it that was his voice speaking the word amen and when god speaks that's his voice amen then the word of god is the voice of god that speaks to you and i he says after these oh excuse me i'm looking at luke instead of john excuse me for a minute john 10 and 1 it says verily verily i say unto you he that enters not by the door into the sheepfold but climbing up some other way the same is a what i'm gonna tell you something jesus i'm the door isn't that right but see listen the voice of god listen to his voice now if you're going to try to get around jesus brother sister what's wrong because of greed and gain balaam didn't want to listen to god because he wanted promotion he didn't want to listen to god amen don't you know god puts up and god takes down promotion come from the lord all good and perfect gifts come from above are you with me power belongeth to the lord amen he says if you try to get in any other way you're thief in a robber he said but he that entered in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter open the sheep what somebody say i'm not a sheep i'm a goat okay i understand you've identified who you are and if you're a goat i i expect for you to act like a goat but he said the sheep are you with me they hear what oh yeah that's that's what it is the sheep hear his voice and and he what he called his own sheep by what by name now god identifies that he's going to call you by your name because he knows my name i said he knows my effort hallelujah are you with me this morning amen he knows my sheep no they understand what i'm talking about they understand amen i can't do a thing without him they understand that it's god i need god every day every hour every moment i need him i'm helpless praise god i need god oh god i need you praise god i said how oh how much do the people need to hear from god they need to know that god is real they need to know the love of god they need to know that somebody cares about them you don't even know how to take care of yourself i don't know the bible says we're not sufficient of ourselves and oh as we have it oh lord we don't know how to take care of ourselves but our sufficiencies of god amen god knows my every cry he knows my every need he knows everything about me praise god i said lord i that personal encounter amen saul latasha he thought he thought he knew god but when when the light shined from heaven and he heard that voice amen he said who are you lord see brother and sister it comes that time that we need an encounter with god we need to know that voice would speak to me lord lord speak amen he said who are you lord the lord said i'm jesus amen you know you can be prosecuting him you can be doing all kind of stuff against him praise god god can be right there using his children using his children daily remember saul didn't recognize amen it wasn't stephen it wasn't even praise god those christians that was the problem it was god it was god and the christians that saul of torture amen was trying to persecute them even they wasn't he wasn't persecuting them he was persecuted he was against god because god was in his people are you a man so god identified himself amen when he said why persecute thy me amen when he heard that voice that was the voice of change that was the voice amen the stop amends saul of tasha's in his tracks praise god not only did god amen have a sign with the light that shine from heaven but of the voice in the sign praise god god had a voice and he spake amen and when saul heard him say i'm jesus hallelujah how much do we need to hear that voice and i'm jesus hallelujah i'm jesus whom you touch up to whom you seek whom you need i'm god the one that made the heavens and earth i'm the one he made the causes used to be in existence i'm god oh i heard david said know you that the lord he's god it is he that has made us power blown to god and not we ourselves we are his people and what other what the sheep of his past amen he said my sheep listen they know for they know his voice and the bible says in the fifth verse and a stranger they will not are you i'm gonna tell you how do you know it's a stranger are you certain about what voice you listen to is it a certain sign or uncertain sound the bible said that the trumpet gives an uncertain sign who's going to prepare himself for battle god servant talked about a certain sound brother and sister we should have a certain sign for this age god has spoken in this age to this generation to you and i it ought to be the voice that was promised the voice that said come out of here my people be not particulars of our sin amen it's the force of an accident it's a voice that calls you an eye out on a mystery battle of an antichrist who is the word praise god god calling you back to himself amen back from creeds and dogmas back to jesus christ back to the word back to the faith that once delivered unto the fathers contending for that faith have you heard the voice brother and sister the voice of god because you and i back to the word have you heard the voice praise god if you haven't heard the voice amen then you must have a personal encounter amen that god in you meet praise god and i believe that there is a meeting ground a place where god will meet with man praise god for the greatest battle ever fought is fought in the mind praise god and what's going on with you in your mind praise god amen they met praise god there's evil going on and that's good going on that's god going on and that's satan amen that's bombarded in their mind amen but god amen in the greatest battle ever fought you and i they met this morning each and every one of us are being challenged this morning who are we going to listen to what we're going to hear whose voice will we hear this morning who would you listen to praise god there must be a certain sound a sound of certainty and you must be certain of god are you with me you must it's not god is not the author of chaos and confusion praise god god gives us peace in assurance for i can hear david said be still and know that i am god amen praise god we don't stand still long enough if we would just stay still long enough we'll know who's speaking amen the devil makes you so busy and so caught up and so entangled with the characteristic life they admit that he don't let you settle down and and just listen amen you listen but at the same time you're moving and amen it's just like mom or dad or somebody trying to talk to you and you uh yeah yeah yeah but you got disc going on and that going on all kinds of things going on that you don't you're not still enough you got to get in a quiet place praise god get down and pray and get quiet before the lord amen and just say lord lead me guide me oh great jehovah amen lead me guide me hallelujah well i don't want to make shipwrecks in my life god i don't want to go down the wrong path i don't want to lead myself i'll make a wreck i'll make a mess of my life but lord will you lead me will you guide me i believe that leadership is needed and i believe that the leader is here the one that said i'll lead you in god's into all truth knowing the voice of god knowing that he wants to lead you he wants to guard you as i was in prayer he says the reason why people are not hearing from god is because they won't be still the bible said they'll be running to and fro seeking searching but he said be still and know that i'm gone and i would be exalted are you with me can you see what's going on with your life with your present distressed what you're going through right now you want you want to hear from god you want god to speak but you don't have time to listen you're too busy to listen you want god to speak you want this personal encounter you want the you know you you want to know but the one that knows it all knows like he has the answers for your every question he would meet every one of your needs but you don't want to settle down settle down with all that you trying to achieve and say lord i can really i can really make a mess of my life but let me stop for a moment i don't know where you were when god just starts speaking to you always can look back and i can hear that voice begin to speak to me what if i didn't listen i knew what i was going to be there was no doubt in my mind if i didn't listen when i heard that voice because he showed me he showed me what was going to become of me and it wasn't good i had an opportunity to know that it wasn't me talking to myself it was god speaking to me whether i listen to god and take heed or go on i came to that time when i knew god was speaking and i could either just he just said the flashing red lights of his coming i can run the stop sign or i can stop are you with me brother and sister you can stop and listen to god because i know if he's listen if he's speaking he's telling you what you must do saul who are that i'm jesus huh how did you know how did you know that was god speaking to you as a young man how do you know that what what made you drastically change your your behavior and your life changed drastically like that what was so astonishing about this particular encounter what what you know what just turn everything around turn your world upside down and brother and sister if you don't come to that crossroad into that time when you know for certain god is speaking to you if you never come to grips with that brother and sister where you going to end up do you want to travel down a valley of a bottomless pit where there's no you don't even know where you're headed you don't even know where you're going you're just wandering and just i i just go in where you going i'm just going but here you got heaven on your mind you know where you're headed you're not going in an uncertain place you're going to a place god is leading you to a place and where i am there you may be also you're on your road to heaven you go oh i got i got to close let me read this isaiah 40. y'all can come up i'm going to i fought it they maybe y'all help me move a little faster isaiah 40. and like i said it in every age there was a voice in ephesus he he shouted to those people he said i have someone against you because you left your first love was that the preachers of that day telling the people or was it that he said an angel of the church at ephesus when they aimed at god but they got relaxed the present stage of your ministry your life where are you in your present stage have you gotten relaxed you that used to be on fire for god what has happened what causes from that time where are you now from that time praise god can you call back today when you were first illuminated when god had your soul on fire are you with me are you ready to lord now i'm stopping i'm going to redeem the time lord may you restore to me the joy of salvation i need it back i need a real genuine move of god in my life let me tell you something there are overcomers in each age amen what the voice of god directs us and makes us skillful and makes us understand the will of god for the hour that we live that we might be victorious and overcomers in this age as those that wanted to overcome in that age in ephesus amen he said i would that you were hot or cold amen in this particular age they ought to see you because lukewarm i'll spew you out of my mouth are you with me so in this age here lukewarmness won't do just come in the church amen we got to be on fire because if you're not on fire you won't have
