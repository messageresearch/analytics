your hand for you to get glory and praise out of our lives in jesus name amen mark 11 22 we thank god again i'll tell you i was just listening to the prophet concerning perfect faith and i was in pain and i began to meditate on that word and as i began to meditate on the word i said i'm not gonna let feeling pain discourage me and i just kept on believing and kept on trusting until the pain went away god is good isn't that right i i said he's the same god amen what he did yesterday he's still doing today god never changed amen mark 11 22. jesus asking and said unto them have what have faith in god that's what we're saying this morning perfect faith have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed think about your mountain this morning well he said whosoever will you say it to your mountain be thou removed amen for whosoever will say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not what thou where in his heart but shall believe that those things which he what which he shall believe that those things which he said shall what he what he should have whatsoever is that right does it work today can god do it today same yesterday today and win oh god is the same therefore i say unto you what things so ever ye what when you pray believe that what that you what have you been praying lately believe that you received them and what you should have them amen and when you stand praying what if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespass but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespass god bless you renewed word so faith is based off of what forgiveness [Music] faith is based off of forgiveness if you have faith in god then you must be willing and able to forgive now how many things that you think god has forgiven you of because if you're not willing to forgive your brother or your sister then how you were expecting god to forgive you are you with me and how can you fully have faith in god when you don't have a forgiving heart if faith is based off of forgiveness are you with me so many times uh we have imaginary faith we imagine that we believe and then we presume that we believe that means we venture without authority we imagine and imagination is not faith what you imagine is not faith so i used a little sub topic this morning called real faith i mean faith is real a real faith faith is real amen now in reality we know that seeing a sight is real isn't that right how do you know the sight is real because i'm looking at y'all and i can see y'all right so we can decline sight or sin as being real because i can see the lights on isn't that right and we all that have eyes and can see you can have eyes and not be able to see isn't that right but we that have eyes and the ability to see you can anybody tell you that the seats that you oh some people can be colorblind thought about my brother-in-law use colorblind you can look at these seats and you can declare that these seats are white huh by seeing these seats you can declare that they are what white they blew how do you know that they're blue because you see them right you see that these seats are blue isn't that right so if i told you the seats are white amen your sense of sight tells you that they are blue isn't that right so you're not going to let me tell you that these seats are white when your sense of sin declares that they are blue isn't that right so you you're trusting in the ability of your sight amen and you know your sight is real are you a man now your sense of touch a feel you know that's real why amen because you can touch somebody just touch a part of your body you feel it right you know that's real all of these senses that we declare to be real because we can exercise they're manifested amen by you using those senses those five senses but the sixth sense which is faith amen it's just as real as any of the five senses because hebrews 11 says 11 and 1 says now faith is the what so faith is a substance it's something that is just as real or more real than the five senses so we're talking about perfect faith the prophet of god said we're coming up a little higher that we can get into rapture and faith and so forth we're going into a deeper understanding of faith because we're going to need that to get raptured out of here are you with me so we need to understand amen faith amen and not just imagine that we have it and think we got it when we need rapture and faith and perfect faith is real okay so um this perfect faith let's go to romans 10. perfect faith romans 10 because the devil he'll try to make you doubt whether or not this faith is real the devil will always work on your conscience your imagination your memory and he'll work you're trying to get you to reason all kinds of things but once you have perfect faith it's an ankle you you become anchored you know a lot of people are not certain of the even their salvation they're not certain they they they they say one day and tomorrow they don't know whether they're saved some folk are here one day and tomorrow they they're not healed and some folk you know people are somewhat puzzled but once you're anchored and you know that god saved you some folk can say i know god saved me because i used to be a drug addict i used to be an alcoholic i used to be uh an adulterer a fornicator i used to do all kinds of rotten stuff but i don't i know god christ came into my life and saved me now notice what he said in isaiah 53 uh for he was wounded for our what trans aggression just as much as that's real that we believe that god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believing them should not perish but have everlasting life we believe in the reality of god amen dying on the cross and by faith we receive the forgiveness of sin we know that jesus forgave us of our sin and we accepted that fact that jesus died for my sin and if i accept what he died for then i am saved and our lives spontaneously changes the places that we used to go we don't go no more things we used to do we don't even know them anymore why because christ has come into our lives and we are saved and the manifestation of uh and the proof that we are saved amen is that god has changed our lives are you with me and and we give the credit to jesus and what he did for us when he died on the cross at calvary isn't that right and that's a reality can anybody tell you you're not saved well i you know sometimes the christians get down the road a long ways down the road and sometimes they say they doubt their salvation it's just like uh israel when they came out of egypt and all the miracles all the signs and all the wonders they doubted you know we could have stayed back down in egypt we were better off israel came out of bondage and all the deliverance yet they said let us go back to egypt for we were better off in this wilderness you see how how folks can it doesn't matter what god does the devil would always try to pursue you he tried to pursue them not to live with pharaoh army but he pursued them mentally in their minds are you with me he said they all perished in the wilderness because of what unbelief after saving the people they meant afterwards they were destroyed because of unbelief brother and sister you lose out when your faith got to be anchored we're talk about real genuine faith that ankles your soul amen not something that you believe amen you presume that you have something that you know you got and nobody gonna talk you out of it you'll let no the bible said resist the devil and hear what he'll flee from you isn't that right you must aim anything contrary to what to what god says in his word anything contrary to that do what resistance casting down imagination and every hot thing that would what i'm teaching this morning i i i might preach but i i'm teaching are you with me every imagination that would exalt itself against what the word of god the knowledge of god now i want you to know that amen your resistance of the devil is your revelation that you have of what god has done for you amen once you've got a true revelation of your salvation then no devil in hell can talk you out of it no circumstances no condition no oh hallelujah nothing that could come nothing that can go no depth no height no what oh life death principalities power nothing can take away amen what jesus has done for you because your faith is ain't correct i know jesus died on the cross shedding his blood and my sins are forgiven not because of what i've done it's because of what he's done for me amen i just happen to believe it and receive it and as much as we can believe and receive for our salvation then we can believe and receive because he was wounded father transgression bruised foreign i have peace brother and sister if you don't have peace in your down amend what he did for you when he was wounded the peace i give you not as the world give give are you amen you can have peace this morning because that's what jesus purchased for you with his blood [Music] amen just talking about peace was upon him and with his brother and sister so many people are sick and living beneath their privileges is because amen they think they believe they presume that they believe they imagine that they believe amen but god's servant god prophet said you got to know your position you got to know your position and when you're out of position you're out of the words amen but want to believe or understands and knows their position in the word praise god no devil amen can defeat you amen praise god knowing your position i i i said 10. now here's in 17th verse romans 10 17 it says so then faith come by so how do i get faith faith come by what not something that i imagine not something that i see amen it's what i hear faith come by hearing if you believe what you hear and hearing come by what hearing come by the word of god amen so if i hear what the word says and isaiah 53 then i can trust what god said about it and if i amen if i believe what god said about it then it doesn't make a difference what who else says about it because i accepted what god said about it and what god said about you and what god said about your healing it's sure it's steadfast it's an anchor to the soul brother sister no devil in hell can talk you out of it amen because you must as an individual have your own personal revelation you must hear the voice of god speak to your heart and go down into your spirit man and energize your faith amen and brings up a manifestation of reality to you amen so what happens amen [Music] it's not a potential acorn it's a potential oak tree but real faith has it oak tree not the potential but the real faith genuine faith i have an oak tree not an acorn but i have the tree [Music] are you with me so i'm not potentially uh oak tree i have the oak tree see a lot of times we have the potential but we don't have the tree itself [Music] amen so we are believing for the oak tree but we don't have the oak tree as a yet but you must real genuine faith brings into the manifestation that i have the oak tree praise god i'm not waiting on the oak tree but i have the oak tree what am i saying i have my healing now i'm not waiting to be here i am healed amen i'm not waiting to see whether or not the pain is going to go away the pain has gone away i'm not waiting on the doctor to tell me my cancer is gone the cancer is gone because the word has declared the cancer goal can the cancer stand against god's word the word said the cancer is gone so who who should believe our report amen who whose report uh who who who are you going to believe the word of what what's out there in the atmosphere if you believe the word then you must know amen it doesn't matter the condition abraham the bible said he staggered not amen 99 years old but he staggered not amen why because he had perfect faith in what god had declared amen so i'm going to the bible said he became stronger amen because he knew that what god has promised god was able to perform god you you said and amen i can stand ashore you said brother simmers if you speak faith like that then nobody gets sick nobody'll die oh brother we're on that road we're on that road amen where we going we're talking about rapturing faith we're talking about getting out of here we're on the road the church is moving on the church the bride is moving on we're moving on where are we going amen praise god you know it's something about the disciples having the power of god they could not heal the man's son amen that he said and he brought him to jesus he said i brought him to your disciples but they could not do it the disciples had power amen we could have uh you know uh uh a bullet uh and and and though we got the bullet the bullet you know and got the power and all that but we got to put it in the gun and ignite it all you would and then it goes off amen then the disciples had power but they didn't have faith to ignite the power are you with me you can have power say i got the holy ghost i got power but i don't have faith to operate are you with me you must have faith to operate the power [Music] are you and god is bringing that to a special bride chosen people faith to operate the power of god god is a creator and god wants you to know that you are amateur creators your little messiah rats are you with me and god i'm talking about a people that are coming into maturity abroad that's coming into her position knowing who she is are you with me i'm talking about getting out of here something that anchors down something that anchors down in my soul amen and something tell me you you you can't you're in too much pain to walk you're in too much pain and so i i i i said i refuse to limp you know sometimes you're in so much pain you hobbling so i said i i'm refusing why because i was acting on perfect faith so me acting on perfect faith i began to walk i i began to do what i couldn't do uh prior i said i'm walking i'm walking in perfect faith and i had to just not just uh have an imagination but i had to say god your word said and i'm walking in perfect faith amen i'm not walking with how i feel because if i feel i i would sat down but i'm walking in perfect faith amen my feeling amen is not i i'm not dealing with what i how i feel but i'm walking in perfect faith i'm walking without a limp i'm not feeling the pain no more amen praise god so the devil has no i'm resisting the pain i'm telling the devil amen i'm not accepting the pain no more i'm walking in perfect faith amen if i'm gonna have perfect faith it's time now for a manifestation of it amen so god manifests what you said in your word amen if i got it then let me use it amen the disciples did not have the holy ghost yet to have this perfect faith then we need the baptism of the holy ghost are you with me so they brought him to jesus amen and jesus said this can't come about but by fasting in prayer are you with me but if they had perfect faith amen then they they say he said because of your unbelief are you with me it's it's something about it was something that they did not believe amen and because they couldn't believe it enough that they could cast those devils out they meant those devils would not come out those devils got an intelligent is it like a dog got a little sense amen it knows whether you're scared of him or not and you can't bluff that dog amen he knows what you're afraid and when he gets you scared and you say well i ain't scared of you and then you jump and that dog jumped back at you and you oh you got to run amen see that devil amen he wants to make you jump amen you got to say boo devil i said boo and that devil knows what you mean business when you said boo devil he's not getting bigger anymore he's getting smaller your mountain is coming down amen you set buddha amen your mountain your situation is changing now i believe situations are changing right now in the building situations are changing right now amen because you're creating an atmosphere for change you're recognizing your position in christ jesus knew who he was so the devil could not say i i assure you all the kingdoms that the word of you by now he knew his position he knew who he was and he knowing who he was strictly amen he was able to manifest what the word says about him amen he knew what the word said about him so he was able to stand on that word because he knew the word declared him to be the son of god and the word said when he come what do you do and he was not worried about he meant trying to work up something it was not something he was guessing on it was not something that he was imagining he wasn't worried he was god so he wasn't trying to be god he wasn't trying to work up to be something that he wasn't now you must recognize your position recognizing who you are it's nothing that you imagine amen nothing that you got to work up oh oh i wonder i wonder i wonder if i am who god said i am are you are you thinking sometimes amen maybe amen something is missing amen am i who god says i am or are you certain of god the brother god said you must be certain of god as an individual you must be certain of god and if you are certain of god then you know that the promises of god are yeah and not nay and you you know you can have what god said is yours are you with me if god amen you must possess amen everything that god says belongs to you you must be able to reach out and to possess it amen not just talk about it but possessing the gates of your enemy are you with me you must possess it amen and jesus amen what the word said about it he he in other words he packed it amen the word had said that amen uh about jehovah jaire amen that provides our needs jehovah or rapha the lord that healeth thee jehovah shalom he packed that in his body he was jehovah i am that i am so he knew that he was the word made flesh isn't that right so he wasn't trying to work up now amen as believers you must recognize your position who you are in christ are you with me see what happens amen when you doubt who you are when you think that you are who god said you are that's a mental conception amen as long as you think it he said as a man think it's in his heart so is he amen but if it's just imagination thinking but if you're born again the bible says it's not your faith that god is looking for the bible said the just shall live by his faith are you with me so you're not dependent on your own it's his faith once you receive the holy ghost one of the gifts of the spirit is faith jesus amen praise god he had perfect faith they met because he knew who he was so he can have perfect faith in the word because he was the warrior praise god once you know know your position as believers then as a believer you can operate as a believer you cannot operate as a believer until you know your position these signs shall are you with me he said these signs what shall follow them that amen it's not a maybe or might be or should be these signs shall follow them that believe isn't that right and if i'm a true believer amen praise god if i am a true believer then i don't try to make something work i don't have to think that it works amen all i got to do is just believe be who i am and decide well are you with me the signs were what amen because that's who i am jesus was able to do the things that he did because of who he was amen and the signs followed the believer amen a believer is not fallen signs but the signs follow the believer are you with me praise god and that's why i amen some people try to follow after signs amen and they are falling at the signs everywhere is a sign yeah i heard prophetess so and saw in prophets so and so i heard the fallen signs but the signs just fallen to believer amen it's not the man it's still amen who you are it's not the prophet it's who you are as a believer you must have your personal amend revelation as an individual amen who you are and then only then will your faith be anchored praise god i gotta i gotta go to another a part of this lesson so i gotta get up back up on the pulpit and read another scripture are you all all right clap your hand and say thank you jesus lord i'm glad to know who i am hallelujah it's good to know that i'm a believer amen that song says i'm a believer it's good to know that i'm a believer amen i'm trusting that amen praise god in my ability but as a believer amen god has given you power amen i give you power to thread on serpents amen i give you power amen and as a believer amen i got a right praise god i know my i know my position praise god i know who i am praise god the devil will fight you amen the devil tried to knock it try to knock you out try to knock you down you know i said lord you know it almost makes it almost impossible for the devil to get in once your faith is beginning to develop and you recognize who you are amen then the devil is no match for you amen he's no match amen for a true believer amen the devil is no match and yet god allows certain things to happen to our bodies something to happen in our lives amen but no matter what happens god allows they meant the deadness of silver wound and abraham they become all dried up and everything he allowed all of that to happen to him but it didn't hinder it didn't stop the promises of god amen god allowed amen the enemy to come in and amen do certain things in our lives but it does not hinder amen who you are glory to god hallelujah i'm not doubting god god amen if there was no sin amen there never be no amen one uh salvation amen if there was no sickness there would be no healer amen but but it because amen god allowed sin then you see that healing had a chance to manifest itself and nobody was lost amen then there amen there would be no manifestation of savior amen but those attributes wanted to be on display amen so god amen because there was a need of god expressing his attributes he allowed certain things amen you and i are caring and packing testimonies of what god done for us in our lives amen god has amen giving you amen testimonies that god amen can deliver amen from even amen the the the the lowest of the lord it's in the amen when you're at the bottom amen with your town and out the god can do it when you don't have no money and the pills are amen are looking you in the face but god it's god to supply all my knees [Applause] amen oh yes once you know that god is god and god does what he says amen you know condition does not hold you back they ain't pray amen because you amen have the faith that is real faith that is substance faith amen that you know it's there meant praise god something that you have they meant that you know
