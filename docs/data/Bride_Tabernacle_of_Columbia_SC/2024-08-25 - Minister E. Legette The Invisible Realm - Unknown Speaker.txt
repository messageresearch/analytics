from oh God Heaven bread from Heaven meet and du season do it God I pray this morning move in a mighty way Lord for we love you we appreciate you for all your goodness and your grace in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good as we stand and we'll turn to the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter by the grace of God try not to hold you long this morning amen God is good ain't it we want to talk about the invisible realm this morning amen the invisible realm Hebrews 11:1 if you got it say amen amen and it reads now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not what seen seen for by it the elders obtained a good report yes that through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of what come on now not by the word of some great bishop or Apostle or preacher right or church but we know that it was framed by what the word of God Amen so the word of God has power in it doesn't it it's power in his word amen amen to what create right amen so so that the things which are seen were not made by the things which do appear you may be seated this morning God bless the reading of his word and read a little bit more but we want to talk about the invisible real this morning amen the invisible Realm when you when you talking about something invisible you you're defining a force that can't be seen with the natural eye right can't be seen you know just out like that but sometimes you have to take instruments to see that which is invisible right I you know electrician by trade I always tell people that you know as an electrician you dealing with something you can't see you have no even real knowledge of it's there you can't see it you can't smell it is no way that the five senses unless you grab hold to it can tell that it's there now you'll know it's there then you grab hold to it the wrong way right but we do have certain things that we can use to gauge how much voltage or or or amperage is flowing through something right but it's there but all the time but we we can't see it right so when we thinking about like we said the invisible real we talking about stuff that you can't see right so we know that you know many of times we only look to the things that we can see without natural eyes right and some of the people that can't see they only look to the things that where they can touch right feel Conta in his five senses so the body itself is is limited to this world right but I'm preaching to you this morning that is another realm out there hallelujah it's another place Hallelujah that we don't know about sometimes but in that place there there is no law of gravity Hallelujah there is no law of the five senses in that in that realm Hallelujah all things are possible amen that real you ain't limited by what the doctor say hallelujah or what your bank account saying or whatever it might be in that realm you're not limited Hallelujah because in that realm all things are possible so a lot of times as we say we we govern ourselves by this by by that this realm we living in but you know in that realm you know as we talk about instruments to the the the contact things in other Realms and and that real the the instrument that's needed I would call it to contact that real is Faith Hallelujah faith will unlock things for you in your life you know it's something about faith that you know you can have faith in many things right people can have faith in the doctor have faith in this and that's all right sometimes but your faith can't rest in that because when that fail then that's the end that's the end of the line Hallelujah because that's where your faith ended at right but you know uh I often say sometimes about you know uh Moses and this he was born his mother you know she HD him for so many months long as she can hide him right but when she couldn't hide him no more Hallelujah and they took that basket and put it out in the river she least that the God it was no longer in her control now she was looking to the invisible realm right she take it out of her hands now the situation is out of my control now I'm putting it in God's hand come on that's when Faith started right there at the river Hallelujah and what it was in that real Hallelujah the crocodiles or whatever was in the river at that time they couldn't touch that basket or that Arc that he was in because he was protected by something that was invisible y'all believe that this morning come on Hallelujah they might have been 9 10t long or so powerful might have had hippos or whatever out there but they couldn't cross that barrier that God had around them Hallelujah it was a hedge around that basket come on now somebody says that was a miracle yes it was a miracle God still work miracles don't and you know many of times our situations look hopeless don't it looks might bad but in the other realm somewhere come on it's Angels yes it's barriers around you the devil and all the signs want to breach that barrier but they can't J Hallelujah God's got a barrier around me ain't you glad this morning that God has a barrier around you glory to God God knows what he doing don't he come on but I says in the that that room you know and that's we we so limited a lot of times but the hour that we're living in you know even though the world and all of its goods and all of its resources even here in America we coming back to that time to where it ain't going to mean a thing come on now how much money you got ain't going to mean nothing after a while how young you are ain't going to mean nothing after a while even if you live long enough that's going to change ain't it come on now but you know say I'm young come on but I know that you know even Caleb had had a testimony once he said I was 40 something years old when Moses does promised me the mountain and I'm 85 now he says but I'm just as strong today as I was back then why because it wasn't a natural strength that he was looking at but it was the strength in that other realm Hallelujah I'm just as strong as my faith is hallelujah I'm just as strong as my God is oh Jesus Hallelujah but we find that I says you know many times you know you got faith in many things but your faith if if it's resting on anything else when that thing fa fails your faith your faith fall with it your situation fall with it but faith has to find a resting place and the resting place that faith loves to rest in and that is the proven word of God Amen come on how many know God's word is proven this morning come on now I ain't talking about something that they just came up with and they don't know whether it's going to with stand the the Fire or the floods come on but I'm talking about something that's already been battle tested already been proven that it'll withstand the hardest of Trials the hardest of storms the Great greatest of wins Hallelujah God's word will withstand all of that want it come on you know I I worked in U out in the in in uh in in the military we had the Doomsday bunker on the base I was at you go so many feet down below the ground and they said they got enough supplies to last so many years down there you know and the thing is they they only had room for the president and his immediate family and his cabinet and their immediate family so you and I will be left out right but they said it the barriers could withstand so much of a blast and this and that but our question was how do y'all know has it it has it been tested out yet come on now see they just talking in theory of what it could do but it ain't facts because it ain't been tested yet come on so they putting a confidence in a theory right something that might fail and it might not fail Hallelujah but you and I won't have to worry about going down there anyway because we Wen invited come on but this morning our conference ain't in the Doomsday bunker amen amen ain't in a theory of man but our confidence is in what the proven word of God hallelujah and in his word it says that heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall not pass right come on now oh Jesus I'm my faith is resting in The Proven word of God that he said try me and see won't I do what I said that's way my faith is resting at when no food is on the table Hallelujah I never seen the righteous forsaken nor SE baging for bread God's got blessings for us come on now I said your faith come on in The Invisible realm but we find that like we says you know uh uh those things aren't aren't proven right or they in theory because they'll fail you sometimes you know I was sharing at the church Friday night I said you know I was in prayer the other day and I was meditating and I said Lord the scripture came to my mind that God is not a man that he should lie come on now and it was so powerful because you can begin to think about what's bothering you right now Hallelujah you can think about what El you right now right and I know one thing that God is not a man that he should lie whatever God promised you you and I this morning all of his promises are yay and not n and that's why we can walk Victorious that's why we can have joy unspeakable and full of Glory that's why we can shout when we come in the house of God that's why we can lift up our hands and say praise God anyhow Hallelujah anyhow that's why we can do those things because we know that our God can't lie the promises that he made us come on now hallelujah oh Jesus I was saying that the other night I says the scripture came to my mind I says God is not a man that he should lie come on God God is is still a Creator I started saying to myself God is still a Creator God can create when all the resources and everything fell God can create I believe it Hallelujah that's what my faith says hallelujah oh Jesus I started saying God Is A Healer Hallelujah come on now body wrecking with pain or whatever it might be God Is A Healer I meant to tell uh brother Sim the other day I my leg was hurting me on the left leg it was hurting me bad and all the everybody at work caging me you need to go to the doctor go to the doctor and I told him I'd go see the doctor but that Friday night I asked R Sim to pray for me back there in the back and he prayed for my leg and as I was sitting here on the front row seat I started feeling like it was something tight on my leg to me I I felt felt like I said is that big knot on my leg shrinking that's what I started thinking but you know by the next day that thing was gone half down the size it was and so even you know it hadn't the pain and all hadn't come back to this day now it's just like a a little lump or something there but I says what it is God is still healing now God is the Healer the boys at work asked me they say you went to the doctor I said no I had to passor pray for it Hallelujah and I believe that come on am but what it is if your faith don't if you don't believe in that come on you only limited to this real come on but in that invisible real in that place miracles happen healings take place Revival breaks out things happen in that place Hallelujah am oh Jesus and that's the place we want to live in this morning but we find it I say many of times you know we we have we we we're governed by this realm I want to I I was meditating I says what it is you know uh what you can talk sometimes and and you don't understand many of times the power that your your your words have you don't understand the power that you got in your mouth come on come on now he says in one place that if you say to the mountain not touch it not do anything but if you say to the mountain be thou removed it'll remove itself he says but you got to have what faith and don't doubt it if you speak to the mountain come on now God has put the authority in your mouth Hallelujah speak to that situation speak to that trial speak to that storm speak and don't doubt it oh Jesus speak it and just start praising God for it speak it and just start testifying how about it speak it and start worshiping God hallelujah oh Jesus it's power in what you got in your mouth come on now life and death is there you know I was I was demonstrating that the other day to the CH children in Bible study I was explaining to them I I started talking to them about uh the the forest and the green leaves and then the winter comes and I started describing how the winter comes and all the leaves fall off now you can see through and but I was making it intentionally describing it right and I can see them go until days my My Little Children right and I said see just by me talking about it you already got an image in your mind I said just by me speaking talking like that it already created an image in your mind you can see it already can't you Hallelujah and my little daughter Mary said yeah can I said see what it is what you're saying Ain got power in it that's right when you're speaking negative and you speaking about all the bad things and all the signs Hallelujah and all the pain and all the hurt when you talking about it something is being created by what you're talking about when you talking about oh it might not be and how all this and all the doubts and the fears it creates a image in the mind come on now and it may determine the outcome oh Jesus I can see how those 10 spies they come back or 12 Spies they come back from seeing the land Hallelujah even though they brought the fruit of the land Hallelujah they brought back the evidence that the land is just like what God promised it to be God didn't lie to us it's flowing with milk and honey hallelujah oh Jesus they brought back the evidence of it Hallelujah the grapes and the fruit of it I can see Israel rejoicing when they saw the evidence of it come on God has brought us through this and he's brought us through that and he's told us and made us promises and now we at the point of a breakthrough and the land is just like what God said it to be hallelujah oh Jesus God I'm brought some of us from a mighty long way and sometimes we right there at the point of a breakthrough Hallelujah I said Don't Let The Devil stop you when you at the point of a breakthrough oh Jesus Hallelujah but you see how powerful the voice was what did those spies started doing the 10 or whatever they started saying yeah the land is what God Said but it's Giants in the land yeah they started describing the cities and the wall cities and the Giants and then one of them even says we in our own eyes are like grasshoppers Hallelujah got fear broke in the hearts of the people right because of the words that they spoke it it created a image in their mind right that they saw themselves as grasshoppers they saw themselves as a defeated Church Hallelujah they saw themselves as a defeated people after all that God has done for them already after the mighty works and the signs and the Miracles now they looking at themselves as a defeated group come on now that's right Hallelujah but it was two out of the group that tried to steal the people and let them know that it don't matter we ain't looking at those things my faith is resting on The Proven word of God hallelujah God has already proved to us that he'll fight all our battles oh Jesus God already proved us he give us bread in the desert water from the Rock God has already proven to us come on now oh Jesus I said as God proved it to you come on because when God is when you convince Hallelujah the Bible says they had a different Spirit when you convinced it ain't nothing that the devil can bring your way that'll make you doubt the promise of God oh Jesus come on now amen but what it did it created an image in their mind didn't and Adam afraid what they should have came back saying was the land is just like what God said it was be now let's go on over there and get it Hallelujah that's our land God promised it to us now we going to take it not on our own but because God gave it to us it's my right to have it God gave it to me hallelujah oh Jesus come on now y'all third this morning come on I said when it's your right when God give you something the devil don't have no right to squat on your property Hallelujah come on now when God has promised you something the devil ain't got no right to come take it only what you give them come on but I say don't give it to the devil this morning stand up and take what God uh uh giving you today Hallelujah but we find that I says that that's what it did right I says we know that you know that it could create images right come on but in that real Hallelujah in that in that place that's what we trying to get the or the ministry today tries to get the people to see Hallelujah that don't put your trust in this in this world don't put your confidence in the church Hallelujah don't put your confidence in some man or Creed a Dogma don't put your confidence there because all these things will be shaken soon sooner sooner or later in a little while these things will be shaken but if your confidence is in the word of God hallelujah that's what the whole reading of the scriptures was about by faith they move mountains by faith they top of armies by faith Hallelujah Miracles all these things were wrought by faith God did the work and if you would only have faith this morning God would do the same thing for you somebody give the Lord Praise this morning come on I said it's the invisible realm you know what what stirred me we were having Bible study at work the other day I call it Bible study cuz we all just getting in but I was sharing with them I say the thing is you know I was telling them I says it's things in this room right now that you can't see Hallelujah I said you can't see I said let me it's for example I I begin to talk about how you know you can cut you can cut your radio on on a certain Channel if anybody on there talking you'll pick it up right and that channel a and and that radio ain't connected to nothing on the other end it's just all through waves right but I said you turn the radio on right now to a certain Channel you can pick it up right I said how why because it's already in the room going through right now but we just don't have no knowledge of it but man is found a way to to catch what's in that room ain't it Hallelujah so I begin breaking down things like that to him and I says you know that's the same thing I says sometimes we look at God and Heaven and all that to be somewhere far off but it ain't it's right here among you how how many believe that this morning he says we're now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right if we in Heavenly places then we is where God is at right come on I says right now in this room it's unseen forces it's things in this room right now hallelujah it's angels in the room and there demons in there too come on but I said it's angels in the room it's things in the room that you don't have no knowledge about come on in that the things that you can't see are greater than the things that we're seeing come on but God has got to open your eyes hallelujah amen that you can quit looking at your situation amen you can quit looking at what you fa with quit looking at what you're dealing with come on and look to that unseen realm look to that unseen Force that's in the room hallelujah oh Jesus come on now but what it is we we can't do it sometime we struggle with that don't we come on we struggle with that but I says the thing about it is you know the Bible declares here in the here in the in the uh six verse 11 and 6 he says but without faith it's what come on now it ain't even possible to please God come on amen amen to please God he says without faith is what imposs come on it ain't even possible come on why would God make it that way he's God he can do whatever you want right but without faith it's impossible to to please him amen but he says that for he that cometh to God must believe that he what he is and that he is a what rewarder of them that do what come on now what if it don't happen after the first day come on what if it don't look like God moved after the first week come on he says you got have faith right sometime God tries your faith you say Lord I got faith for God will try you by that Faith won't he come on but one thing about it he's not a man that he should lie right come on he'll show up every time War him come on now you your faith going to be tried now you going to be Tried by what you say you believe you know those Hebrew boys they was tried wasn't they come on now they believed in a God that could deliver amen hallelujah amen do do you believe in a God that can deliver come on now we ain't going to obey the king's order my God can deliver amen oh Jesus amen I'm not looking at how big the situation is I'm looking at how big my God is God can deliver right come on now but their faith was tried wasn't it come on you know God allow them to go all the way to the fire didn't he not just to the door but he allowed them to get in the Fire come on but it's something about it they believe that their God could deliver right they said King we know that even if he don't he's still able that ain't taken away from who he is come on now I believe God can smile on somebody with a faith like that come on but when they got in there fire what happened God showed up right there along with them didn't he come on now but you got to have faith to believe that right you know I remember little testimony one night I was at work and years ago when I first got saved and you know how it is when you first get saved you stirred and you telling everybody about Jesus come on everywhere you go Jesus is on your lips sometime they say that's Wildfire but a little Wildfire is better than none at all come on now out there witnessing and I was I was sharing with the guys I say hey you know I was talking about the Hebrew boys I said I read this thing this morning about the fire and how they got in the fire Hallelujah and how not even the the the the clothes that they they that they had on smelt like smoke God took care of them boys in the fire Hallelujah so I was sharing that with him and the Jehovah Witness guy told me he says now do you I know you don't believe that Hallelujah he said you got to be crazy to believe that I said well I may be I must be crazy then because I believe it amen he said was you there no I wasn't there but I heard it and I believe it am I believe my God can answer Hallelujah he is the consuming fire but I was sharing that with those and so we went back to working that night and I had on some some windbreaker pants nobody they don't wear them no more but the art from the art from one of the Sparks and one of the things must have got out and got all on my pants God is my witness so I was standing up after I got out that pipe from Weller and I stood up and I says you know felt a little warm right and I says when I fli my welding shell up Flames was coming all the way up to this high on my on my body so I stopped and dropped and roll you what you call it get myself out right but the miracle was when I put myself out everybody looked at me oh they thought I was burned up but they looked at me and all of the windbreaker pants had burn turn all around my leg nothing but my underwears was showing come on but not one part of my skin was blistered or burnt or anything it burned all the way around there come on now that was right after I got done testifying about how great my God is come on now and they said you want to go to the doctor I said no take me to that Jehovah Witness hallelujah oh Jesus God is my witness when I got to him I says God is able to do what he said hallelujah oh Jesus I said my God is able come on now they was like Ernest you want to go home and change clothes I said no I'm going to work like this all night because I want somebody to ask me what happened so I can testify Hallelujah about how good God is and about how great God is hallelu I held on to those pants for a long time as a memorial I can look back and say that God is the fire Hallelujah he is the consuming fire if God can do that what can't God do hallelujah oh Jesus come on now sometimes God do things to to shut up all the doubts come on to shut up all the critics Hallelujah it ain't that you get no glory but God is getting all the glory because people don't call you crazy and they talked about you I like that whisper a prayer when men don't believe you Hallelujah but God do it want come on now but you got to have faith right in the what invisible realm come on now but I say that what it is God does those things before you come to him you got to have faith right and believe amen cuz without faith it's impossible sometimes when you talk to people and try to help them with situations they come with all of the things that's wrong right and all of the problems and all of the the nose right but you try to point them to the Bible and wear all of your nose God says yes come on Amen when everybody say no God say yes but you got to believe that he can do it for you but you don't know you don't know I might not know but I know who do knows and that's God hallelujah and he is able come on now oh Jesus but I says that what is looking at that so I was sharing you know we were having Bible study the other day I was doing all the talking but they were stirred amen cuz I'm giving them something to to think about now I said you know one thing about it you know uh a science always try to discredit God don't they always try to I was talking to them about the the partho Genesis I think I preached a message on that one time and how some animals can reproduct without you know the the the sperm or or whatever and they were saying that that possibly what happened to Mary come on and talking about they they call it the the the Virgin birth phenomenon Hallelujah so I read a little bit about what they talking about and they call me crazy Hallelujah they call you and I that believe that the word of God framed the world's crazy but go listen to what they talking about come on but the thing is I was explaining to them that I say what the Science World calls it they they call it it the God particle they don't understand where the intelligence come from and I was talking with the guy he was talking about how you planting a tree and I was asking them do you know how that tree survives in the winter time come on because all the sapl or the life or whatever that's in the tree before the fall and the winter comes it'll go down into the roots of the tree Hallelujah that that tree might look like it's dead come on in the winter time but it's still life the life is down at the roots it it's just going through a little season right now but when that season is over the life is coming back out oh Jesus come on now all right I said that tree just going through a little something right now come on now but that's the same way it is in our lives ain't it come on sometimes we look at situation people don't realize come on but they might just be going through a little something right now come on don't worry about it because of the life of God was ever in there it ain't going to die come on oh Jesus but was was talking about that and and how you know they was trying to figure out how the tree has its own intelligence how the the the animals have their own intelligence and all these things it said if we can crack that then we can crack the God particle we can break into things that we'll defy gravity we'll be able to live forever and all these things but what they looking for Hallelujah God has already revealed it to us hallelujah we didn't have to spend no money in all this research to find out about it Hallelujah but it's by faith these things are found out come on they looking for how you live forever but God has given us the answer didn't he Hallelujah he says I'm the way the truth and the life Hallelujah am oh Jesus come on now God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him Hallelujah come on amen God has already given us the ab but I was sharing that with them I said what it is come on you looking at something they want to be able to man always want to find a way that they can tangibly touch it feel it or yet they won't believe it they restrict it come on but if you would only know Hallelujah to reach out as these in faith God called them but the thing that they had to do they had to hear the voice amen and after they heard the voice they had to move move upon the voice that they heard going out not being able to see it but the Bible says that Abraham though he he he when he God called him come on he says he he was surging on the strange places right going to and fro looking for a city whose Builder and maker was who God come on now let's let's read that here in the in the eth verse he says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which should have after receive for his inheritance obeyed come on now he had to obey God didn't he come on now he was called but he had to obey him right so many people say God Ain never I never seen God do I never seen God do have you obeyed the Lord this morning have you stayed long enough to wait on the Lord come on patience is more precious in Gold have you stayed long enough to wait on them come on now he says but and he went out not knowing where he went come on he didn't seem to have no direction did he seem to have no leadership come on he didn't know where he was going all he know that a voice was calling him and he was following the voice and that's how many of us in our Christian Journey came about come on God called you I don't know what it was at the time but I knew something was tugging on something was pulling on my heart telling me you don't belong Where You Are get up and get out of there come on something was calling on me oh Jesus might didn't know where I was going but the Lord was leading you come on and there's no greater leadership than God himself come on he says didn't know where he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in the Tabernacle with Isaac and Jacob and HS with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which have foundations Hallelujah come on how many know this world we living in ain't got no Foundation come on now ready to break apart at any time ain't it come on don't got no foundations tell the truth come on but he wanted a he was looking for a place that had Foundation looking for a place that had something that he could stand on right come on says whose Builder and maker is what God God through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even one and him as good as dead so many as stars of the sky multitude and sand which is by the seashore innumerable come on I said God can do all things can he come on in that you know and God called Abraham he was such an older age and his wife but the Bible says though they seem to be dead right out of them sprang one and from that sprang more than the stars in the sky right more than the sands on the seashore right come on in Abraham was lying life it was it it was seed in there right God called him but by faith he went out and didn't God do what he said amen God didn't let one word fall to the ground what looked like it was dead God brought life from it amen hallelujah and we testifying to God's goodness today amen when I was dead in trespassing sin God brought life about come on now that's what he did didn't he when you were Cast Away God brought life come on when everybody counted you out God brought life about didn't come on when people turn their back on you God brought life out of it didn't come on no man knows what the future hold but God himself that's why God can say I ain't give up on him Hallelujah I ain't give up on them because I know what in them one day they'll come to find themselves Hallelujah do you believe that this morning come on now I says but into that invisible realm hallelujah amen come on things can unlock for you you know I was I was looking at Saul and David the difference between them was when Saul Saul his enemy amassing around them him and Jonathan and all those they trembled all the way back to the camp in fear but when the enemies was a was amassing against David and those all David people got upset with him but the Bible says that he C encouraged himself in the Lord right the Bible says he he looked to the hills he said I'll look to the Hills from which cometh my help all of my help coming from the Lord hallelujah everybody turned around everybody scared everybody feared but that don't shake my faith I wasn't trusting in my Army anyway I was looking to the heels I wasn't trusting in My Own Strength anyway I was looking to God hallelujah I'm going to encourage myself that was the difference between them one would looked at what he saw the other one looked at the Unseen the invisible real Hallelujah and that was able to bring things to pass how many believe that this morning come on what it is by faith come on by faith Hallelujah we coming back to that time do you believe that as a musicians come this morning we coming back to that time come on we coming back to where you going to have to believe God Amen Hallelujah one of the boys was having a little talk the other day at work he says that one of his greatest fears since everything is digital now nobody carries cash you wake up and all the banks been shut down or your car and every your bank account's wiped out come on he said that's that's a one of the things he feared because he was showing how it happened to one country come on but the thing is you and I aren aren't like those that don't have hope come on we don't live in fear because fear got torment but how we live is Faith Hallelujah that when everything is wiped out what our what does our faith say God is going to make a way anyhow God is going to deliver he ain't never let me down come on he give and he take away whatever the Lord want to do I'm I'm accept whatever God want to do but I know one thing that God is going to take care of me come on that's where my faith is resting on the proving word come on now God done proved it that's what my faith is resting on oh Jesus that when I get down on my knees I can say Lord you did it once you could do it again come on now amen oh Jesus Lord and God want to do it in your life this morning let us bow our heads the invisible Realm Jesus I said you got to look to the Unseen this morning by Faith Lord God wants to move in your life sometimes we hinder our own blessings because you seen his glory but yet you still can't believe you seen what God did but yet you still having a hard time
