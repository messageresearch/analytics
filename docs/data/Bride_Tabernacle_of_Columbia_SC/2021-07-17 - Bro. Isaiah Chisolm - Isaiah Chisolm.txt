lord why are you standing we just go directly into the word of the lord and i pray god bless you all tonight it's good to see all of you in the house of the lord amen we turn in our bibles to two passages of scripture we will go to first peter five and eight then we'll turn to uh ephesians the sixth chapter amen is this okay brother simmer is it up too far it's okay okay amen praise the lord amen first peter the fifth chapter and begin to read at the eighth verse and it reads be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil is as a royal lion now he's not a lion but he's similar to a rowing lion walking about seeking whom he what may devour in other words satan desire to destroy you amen to sip you as we ephesian the sixth chapter and we read from 10 down to verse 18. thereby saying amen paul says here finally my brotherings be strong where in the lord and in the power of his might not your might but his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wild of the devil the word wild mean the trickery of the devil he said for we rats are not against what flesh and blood it's not your brother it's not your sister but we are wrestling against flesh and blood but against principalities against power against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and haven't done all to stand stand there for having your lawns girl about with truth and having on the breath plate of righteousness and your feet shone with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all take the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery dots of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayers and suffocation in the spirit and watching there unto with all present variants and suffocation for all the saints let us just buy our heads again father we thank you o god for the reading of your word not sanctified to our soul reacts in jesus name you may take your seat amen praise the lord amen brother simon i'm just going to go ahead and take this off do we amen praise god amen you love the lord tonight it's so good to be in the house of the lord you know i reminded david said i was glad when they said unto us let us go into the house of the lord you know it's a good thing when you have a place that you could go and worship him and spirit in the truth i don't know about you tonight but i'm excited amen i'm excited because we're getting closer and closer amen to the changing of these foul bodies can the church say man i'm happy about that tonight amen so we just by the help of the lord i wanted a little thought that the lord gave to me uh the the thought tonight is my text tonight is the greatest battle ever fought and if i could sub text i would put down uh putting on the whole armor of god why is it so important to have on the armor amen why is it so important to have on the armor we put on the armor amen in the natural to protect us amen paul told us a man in this spiritual war that we're in paul remind us pardon me paul remind us that we must put on the whole arm of god that we should be able to stand against the wild the trickery of the devil so we realized in first of all paul told us brothers and sisters he spoke to the church he says uh be strong in the lord so that's the first thing you need to be strong not weak amen but you need to be strong where in the lord and in the power of not your might amen but his might that's why paul said that we should lean to our own understanding that's what he said but he said in all our ways we shall what acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path i thank god amen for the armor amen in this last day so when we put on the armor of god paul said put on the whole armor just don't put on the shoes amen and you don't have on the helmet we're living in a time brother and sister we're we're in a serious seriously spiritual warfare and we realize that we're not wrestling with our precious brothers and sisters because we all is in this together amen we got to fight the good fight of faith and lay hold on eternal life amen i reminded when paul said many will run the race but only one would get the price amen i don't know about you tonight amen i got one thing on my mind i want to receive that trophy man it's no matter what somebody says about me it doesn't matter anymore i just want to get on the other side man i just want to have on the whole arm of god that i'll be able to stand against the wow and the trickery of the devil let me just read something here amen by the help of the lord for we just get carried away here by the heavenly lord the prophet of god says in the message in 1962 he's nine army when it's ready an army a nation is making ready to go against another another nation it shall first set down and figure what what's right and wrong and whether they'll be able to go against a nation a next nation or not jesus taught that and if people will do that if nations will sit down and stripe and think those things both sides we wouldn't have no war can the church say man and the prophet of god spoke on this general custody a man uh he was told not to go to this particular war but he took it with on he took it on himself and he went on to fight in this war amen and end up losing his life so we're living in a time now we have to put on the whole armor of god even when you come to church you got to have on the whole armor even when you lie down at night you got to have on the whole armor i remember about a week a few weeks ago brother simmers i was leaving got up 12 o'clock in the morning to go to work i got about living on the outside and leaving my wife a man in the kitchen and i walked on the on the porch and and in my spirit i could feel amen the gross darkness has covered the earth brother and sister we are living in a dark time we are living in a cold cold time and i'm reminded that our prophet told us in the church age he told us to guard ourselves towards what the last day spirit all lay out a seal he said so many are getting so cold because they haven't realized the effect of the last day spirit brother i will ask people all around how many you know we're living in the last day oh yes brother children certainly we're living in the last day well you know in the last day all the spirit people knows that but they don't know the effect of the last day and that's why you got to put on the hormone because the spirit of laodicea is so cold it's so formal amen we live it at a time now uh folks don't even love to go to church anymore you know uh and i don't understand you know and you know we are facing this thing together i remember when covet 19 saw it in that was one of the most miserable time of my life in this christian walk when we had to stay home and and listen that sermon uh sitting on the couch uh uh uh somebody drinking lemonade listening out a sermon but you know i got sick and tired of that some laying on a laser boy lying back listening at a sermon on a laser boy and some just going to sleep but you know what i did amen as soon as hey man they say we could get out brother i got out and i went down to the building got things together i said man i want to be in church amen i want to be in a place where i can worship god i want to be in a place where i can worship him and spirit and in truth and from that day to this day i have a cool off a bit you know why because i got on the whole armor and when you got on the whole armor you could block amen anything that hit your head and we're living in a time where the greatest battle that's ever been fought we know when when when when our country when and brother eunice i know and some of you may have been in the service hey man you have to have a ground where you meet a neutral ground where you meet to fight that's right i reminded when israel went against uh uh the the uh the children of israel went against the philistines amen they had to choose a ground where they had to meet a neutral ground where they had to meet with goliath and let me tell you a church of the living god satan amen in this flower it's like a roaring lion amen seek him whom he may divide i don't know about you but i have to constantly remind myself i've already made it you said what you're talking about children i've already made i'm just trying to get this old past how to act right i realize that i come from god and i'm going back to god are you hearing me there's no devil that can amen stop you if you come from god and you're going back to god how many you can believe that tonight amen i come from god i don't care what the devil throws i don't care what fire dots he throws that's why paul said above all take what the shield of faith you've got to have a revelation in this hour then the devil will make you cool off you've got to say i could do all things through christ that strengthened me he said well brother children i'm going through but the bible said i can do i personal pronoun i can do all things through christ that strengthen me i could be on fire if i want to amen i could shout if i want to i don't have to let the spirit off lay out a seal slow me down i don't have to worry about what people do slow me down i can have church all by myself you know why because i got on the whole armor brother simmer i realize if i don't keep on the armor bro i take step backward but you know what i'm doing i'm keeping that shield of faith i'm keeping a revelation i come from god devil you might want to leave me alone because you can't get me and that's why you got to have the shield of faith you got to be strong in this hour but see my only know what time i started man praise god i told myself i ain't going to try to be long and i'm sorry oh my i meant to look and see what time but you got to have on the whole arm of god you got to have the shield of faith when the enemy comes in like a flood you got to keep your shield which you're saying brother children you when you lay down at night you got to lay down i hate to tell you but you almost need to lay down with your shield cross your chest i hate to tell you but you almost need to sleep with your boots on are you hearing me because you know anytime you got to run for your life we're living in a prayerless time church of the living god when the enemy comes in like a flood you got to hold up the shield of faith you got to be able to pull down strongholds are you hearing me demon power amen you got to be able to pull down amen demon power in this house that trying to stop the church of the living god i tell that devil i

sister i realized that i'm not keeping myself i'm not keeping myself it's because of the grace of god it's not because i'm a chosen are you hearing me it's not because you is a plumber and you are semi are you hearing me it's because of the blood of jesus is protecting you if it wasn't for the grace of god we won't be here tonight that's enough to shout for amen much as i love my dear precious

brother they told brother browner and the spoken word and reason to see so brother brandon they're talking about your children you know what he said he had on the armor he said oh that's all right that's just a little test from the foundation of the world but sometimes we sometimes we get upset and want to get somebody back but let me tell you what i'm not going to run nobody down i'm not going to do that church i'm trying to get myself ready to get this changed i believe with all my heart we getting ready to break into a church it can't be much longer we're living in a neurotic age people are absolutely losing their mind a brother sent me an article the other day with this gentleman i forget what part of the country he's in hey man he killed his own mother now we hear that all the time he killed his own mama brother simon but he then he turned around and cook his mom and ate her now you tell me what devil out of hell is doing such stuff like that but let me tell you what that's why

so say man we're in a real war church of the living god i thank god for his blood amen and i believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought nice ready to go in action i believe that god has been selecting his soldiers i believe he has been dressing them training them and the battlefront is now set get ready you know i realized that god allowed us to go through trial hard trial hard trial fiery trial why me lord why why not you you know i reminded when brother brown we know he was a professional boxer right well brother brown his trainer was a rugged fella you might have heard his story and brother brown as he would get in the ring with him and he said that fellow were hit so hard he said that fellow hitting me in his stomach and he almost knocked the wind out of him he said why are you hitting me so hard so i want to tough you up bill when somebody give you a blow the blood circulation won't shut off you won't pass out the character of this world the trash the test and the trial when they come you won't pass out but you're standing firm amen we're in a real battle amen and i thank god for his grace amen i praise god i believe in god's word i believe god could do the uh the uh the unreachable uh thank you ever because acts a thing i believe that our god is still a healer you got to keep on the whole arm of god you know brother simon just last week i'm going to tell you this testimony by putting on the whole arm of god in this message right here i read you familiar with it brother brandon talk about this lady uh she had to go to the clinic and she had cancer on the breast that's right and say it was real it was real messy real real you know it was terrible to work with and she would go to this clinic and if this clinic said this daughter said no no i don't want nothing to do with that so she'll go to this doctor and his daughter said no that's too messy i don't want nothing to do with that oh you're hearing me good so after a while this doctor say okay i would take the case but this mother's sitting there with blood everywhere and in the cancer all y'all hear me go the cancer ain't always through a breath in her ribs are you hearing me don't tell me jesus christ ain't the same yesterday today and forever are you hearing me and when they looked at her she had napkins at the napkins and blood amen and the and the nurse began to look at the case she walked over brother simmer and got all of her instruments and tools and things and her husband asked say can i just pray well the doctor didn't too much want him in there he said well i guess you could mine yourself and stay over there and he prayed and said when he prayed it said a rumbling noise folks don't believe those kinds of things happen anymore they think it just happened in the prophet day but let me tell you what jesus christ it's insane yesterday today and forever he was praying and all of a sudden they heard a rumbly noise came through that hospital and the nurse walked over and when she walked over she looked she moved the napkin and she moved another napkin and said where is that one moment she saw it and the next moment it was completely gone it wasn't even a scar there are you hear me so that being said what good is for me to read those things read those stories like a bad story i got to apply the thing for my day are you hearing me lord you the same that will with paul though with iranians they were with martin that's with brother isaac children lord you're the same yesterday lord let us speak the word the word of god is not the even where in thy mouth that is the word of faith if you speak it and don't die so brother simon i got to work early i got to work early and i began to i got to work and i said lord i know you the same lord i said lord i want to step into that rim i just want to believe you you know i'm just crazy enough just to believe where we had a meeting coming up and my car my car the air conditioner went out on it and i thought about three hundred dollars they end up about 740 some dollars well wow i can't i can't well i'm gonna get that in another week i'm trying to catch up other things too but watch god watch god you know what i did brother simmer i talked to the lord and i felt in my spirit i went to mark mark the 11th chapter and verse 23 and jesus said you said not not not you jane say you say you got a mouth you say mark 11 23 you say it to that mountain yeah but that's too big see brother brown said that's when the greatest battle ever come in your mind could i do that don't know don't even think about it just speak the word and you know what i did i said lord i need my call this week brother simon i didn't know how he was going to do it but i was crazy enough to stand on that word i put on the whole arm of god which is the baptism of the holy ghost i said lord i'm going to claim your word i said lord i need my card this week what is 740 to god amen he got a cattle on a thousand hell what y'all think god is amen you say well i get little things because you asked for a little thing once you ask god cause he got more than enough amen he'll bankrupt heaven brother simmer i read mark 11 23 i closed my bible i went to work and at the end of the day we're living in the end time church you got to have some rapture and faith amen you got the kiddo keep on the whole arm of god my father walked up to me and said isaiah don't you want to work somehow i said man i don't like the way y'all doing it out i said but i need to work i said because i said i got this and that and i got some things i needed to catch up and i said my car is in the shop and i said this every bill is 700 some dollars he said that's all i said what do you mean he said that's all he did i said yeah he said uh i could give it to you and you know almost like am i'm hearing this right he said yeah i can give it to you i said you can he said i got some fun that's coming to me that was backed up he said as soon as i get it i give it to you so you know brother brown said you got to be careful when you put things out of your mind that old devil put on snow snowshoes and he'll run down your thaw and try to stop you but when god is in the midst i don't care there ain't no devil out of hell able to stop that my faith is strong enough to go out there and accomplish and come back and bring it back and brother simmer i told my wife i didn't say much about it and i just kind of told my wife about and she looked at me like what you know and i went on back to work and i kind of forgot about him sitting there talking to brother herbert smiley we're just talking about the good of the lord early in the morning and all of a sudden the gentleman come walking by and i'm looking at it as i was talking about the smile he come walking by and reaching his shirt pocket and pull out a knot he couldn't hardly get out he pulled it out and handed it to me and pat me on the show he said count it amen and look i say oh my god but smiley said what's wrong i said oh my god what's mine said brother children what's wrong i said you ain't gonna believe that he said what's wrong less than 24 hours god gave me the desire of my heart because i didn't doubt i believed god's word i got to get your play you got to put on the whole arm of god the greatest battle that's ever fought could god do that could he do it god put the stars in his plane he took the sun and 93 billion miles in the air it's been hanging every sin like a good soldier hallelujah are you a soldier tonight as you are you had duty tonight are you saying yes lord to your will and to your way i report to duty lord i do what you tell me to do if you tell me to pray then i'll pray god if you tell me to fight yes sir i get on my knees and fight if you tell me to love the one that do me wrong yes sir i'm in the army of the lord i got to put on the whole arm of god but simon let me just hit this and i clear i'm going to quick amen if you go to genesis the third chapter amen you saw in the bible the bible said that the serpent was more subtle than any beasts of the field i'm not i'm not going to get on tonight sorry i just feel good i just feel good but somebody i feel real good amen amen i'm saying i feel a real guy how many you feel real good with that am i by myself for what i know i didn't brought this from north carolina now i'll take it back amen let me tell you what the joy of the lord is my strength somebody said brother children why are you so happy why i'm so happy i saw my name in the line book of life by revelation whoo god almighty the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field and god told her nah nah nah nah now if you notice in 1962 brother browner he talked uh uh he talked on the uh the greatest battle ever fought he he talked on the uh uh what's the word uh the three triumphant and we know his body spirit and his soul now if you notice a man in 1962 brother brown taught the body and he taught the inside with the soul and that's what he said then he went to the interim he said that was his spirit but after the opening of the seals when the mighty angel came and gave him a bella see brother brown had a progressive ministry oh you hear me that's all right i'm saying that brother samuel you see some people think that he was jesus christ no he was a man just like you and i paul was a man just like you and i so brother brownlee got a good revelation and he came back and he preached on do you have that give me ten minutes brother said we can do you have that up there the three realms of the spirit praise god oh praise god there you go praise god praise god and i'm not going to hold you alone my i can see it praise god amen and you see we are three triumphant i know we all know that right but it's good to talk about those things is that's right and we are what we are body we are spirit and we are soul that's the out of man that's right and god gave us five outlets are you hearing me god give us five outlets so we could contact the thing around us but the same way would i be out of order if i get down there hallelujah praise god i i'm sorry i'm at i'm at daddy's house amen and i just feel good i'm just gonna be at home amen so we realize we are made out of body spirit and soul every one of us we are body spirit and soul and god gave us five outlets to contact the things around us amen i'll see you could hear me you could feel your face you can hear god gave you the old eye list the contact the things around you but in the inside it's a spirit that's right it's your memory your affection your conscience i'm not going to get with all those but i just want to deal with one in particular and that's reasoning that's in the spirit reasoning and that's what the devil wants us to do is reasoning about god's word now i told the lord i need my car now what is i supposed to tell him brother simon i said lord i need my car this week what else i supposed to do he's a great heavenly father i said lord i need my call that's all he did he told his angel be down there and tomorrow this time and get that boy that money let me tell you church and let me go and i had something else i told the lord and the brother came to me today and gave me that i said what look when god is in the mid god just want you to take him at his word trust in the lord take him out his word don't look don't reason him just believe peter peter get out of the boat lord is that you jesus said guess me he said begged me to come however what jesus said come huh peter stepped off brother simmer peter stepped out the bowels of the boat and wrote scientific proof walked on water never been done before peter walked on water and when peter was walking on the water what happened he started hearing the waves man what if i drown once i lose my car what if i do get cold see but you can't think about those things see that's what's happening to me i just don't think about it uh brother simmer during the covey time i don't know what happened but i was working on the job uptown charlotte and this young fellow working in front of me he was missing in action and the next few days i asked my father i said where's the little guy the little spanish guy he said ralph he got coveted i said what and then the devil said you're going gonna get it next because you're right in front of him you're standing right in the front you're gonna get i said you're a lying devil you can't tell me what i'm gonna get i said with his stripes and heels i believe that i believe it in the heart the third realm down in my soul i believe amen with all of my heart so i went home brother simmer and this had got true my head started hurting back hurting my eyes hurt nose hurt and everything hurt oh my god brother children that you sound like you had this something yeah i might have sound like i had to something but god who is rich in mercy i was laying in the bed but saying thank god for my godly wife amen i'll land in the bed see one thing about my wife i don't know about you brothers in here but my wife she always know brother saying i built that whole house in south carolina i don't think she'd seen me hard work hard work she don't know i'm getting old now and getting feeble a little bit i ain't touching like i used to be plus you always think i'm iron man let me tell you a lot of iron man so i was feeling bad head hurt and i was just landing in the bed my wife said isaiah get up i said no gloria i'm okay i said get up i was getting weak and eyes hurt hey it hurts isaiah get up what was it it was a symptom of that old devil but my wife didn't reason with that she said isaiah get up i said glory please please glory play uh uh our natural way we talk that's a woman please woman please please go somewhere no no get up you got to go to work my wife don't like a lazy man i'll tell you what she's been taught well she don't believe in a lazy man you got to get up and go to work boy so our lady i said glory please i covered my foot up you know what she did brother simon pulled the blanket off of my foot and grabbed my pole of the legs says the palmer and she spiked me in the bottom of my shoe and my feet and say get up out of the bed let me tell i said glory please i pulled my foot back and she popped me again so i said get up i said gloria pete and she kept popping me brother simmer i realized i ain't gonna have to get up or this woman ain't gonna leave me alone i got out of the bed and before i knew it i was going back to work why because something inside of me said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world but that was satan want us to do is reason ourselves right now you don't have to believe nothing that stinking devil will say amen if god hasn't said it then you don't have to believe it amen with this strike i am healed you say well brother children according to the machine you had covered 19 but according to my faith amen i was healed are you hearing me but see that servant came into god and he dealt with that woman spirit realm i'm i've got a few minutes i know i said 10 minutes hey man i'm trying to close by saying i'm sorry i said that one time out of church i said i'm stopping i'm stopping when i got finished preaching i hope you don't do that brother simon the brother walked up elderly brother him and his wife i thought they're going to tell me how to enjoy the sermon he said brother children everybody praise the lord i walked up to him he said come here brother children i got to tell you something i'm looking now you know how we look real reverence you know looking real and i said yeah i thought you're gonna tell me what a good sermon he said my wife and i we noticed you just lied in the pulpit i said but jeremy i got so small i said oh i said sir he said yeah we saw it then we watched you just lie i said uh he almost knocked my breath out you know i had to come back like ali i had to come back i said oh what do you mean he said you kept saying you were going to stop and i watched my wife said he's lying in the pulpit so i've learned to say now i'm condescending i'm coming down but some are a few minutes amen but what that serpent did that serpent that devil let me tell you what the first war was in heaven we all know that right michael and his angel amen but look when satan come on this earth with them fallen demons on this earth the first battle was in the human mind god came into god and told them not to eat of the tree the day you eat of it you shall surely god don't change his mind about his word now the serpent came in there brother jeremiah did you notice he didn't change the sentence he didn't change just one word that's all it takes one word will change and cause every funeral home every crying baby every death every counselor one word one word changed but the devil told her look look your people is so slow y'all need to catch up you'll be asked god you'll know both good and evil and she began to listen to that devil church you don't have to listen that nothing the devil have to tell you you know the devil used to tell me brother simon i i promise i'm gonna go ahead and stop you know uh i'm pardon me but you know i've learned i've learned i don't have to buy nothing the devil hadn't said no i don't brother simmer i don't have to buy i don't have to buy that i brother tim i'm going to tell you as a dream i i dreamed i was working in my yard doing some work and a car pulled up he made the car pull up and i looked it was a male car that's just a dream brother simmer and i i went to the mail car and i saw a brown envelope came out and i could barely see the hand but it hand me the brown envelope it's just a dream and when i reached to get the envelope i could hear my wife screaming it from the from the bedroom winner i saw i saw don't take it and i woke out of my sleep so you don't have to take nothing the devil has to say send it back to the post office send it back from where it come amen and put on the whole arm of god that you'll be able to stand against the wiles of the devil i love you tonight my brother and sister amen i just feel good tonight amen i just followed the lord tonight just put on the whole arm of god just take god at his word and believe god i don't care what the condition is you can speak that word and believe it huh believe it you say brother children he that received a prophet in the name of a prophet receiver prophet war i believe it but brother brother jeremiah uh go ahead and play something easy for me brother that that way i noticed stop amen i remember brother brown and said something you pray for or something on that wise now i'm just crazy enough to believe that you're going to follow somebody somebody said you're following william brown i follow this mess as a fallen prophet as he followed christ are you hearing me but brother branham said take it whatever you desire the lord to do write it down and put it in acts 19. but something you know you use the tallest way back in pentecost act 19 paul and napoleon was at corinth and found certain decisions we know what they're talking about what what acts 19 childhood got to do with my prayer i believe that i put it in acts 19 and god came by the house and paid the bill oh praise god and the same thing last a couple years ago we flew up in new york and uh the brother was the pastor we had a good anointed service and and and the pastors say anybody got anything on their heart upon this anointed word just write it down believe that's why jesus said believe it's not what you see just believe and my wife wrote down we was in south carolina and i wanted to move to north carolina when all that transit was going on at the church i still felt in my heart to move but somehow i packed my stuff i told my family we still moving somebody said where you going i said i don't know i'm just like abraham i said i'm gone because god in my spirit led me to god was a summer we flew to new york and my wife wrote down on a piece of paper she wrote down i want a five bedroom but somebody had a house i was in south carolina my wife said i want a five bedroom and i want a three full bath she wrote it down and she put it in the bar and when we flew from new york back to north carolina uh uh something in the church told my daughter-in-law said tell brother children we got a house he might be interested in it and when i went there but some we count five bedrooms and three full baths my wife somebody said my wife could have asked god for a double garage and god would have put it there y'all might be thinking i'm crazy but that's the god that we serve put on the whole arm of god hallelujah praise god you love the lord tonight hallelujah let's sing this song amen how many love the lord tonight i appreciate you tonight i appreciate you brother simons amen i really appreciate brother simon i thank god for his stand i really do but some i really appreciate you staying i remember i remember i met brother simon i was 17 years old yeah but someone's come pulling up in a brown pontiac buick i think and i'll

him when he's 17 years old and i tell you that you should work hard back then in those fields it's a hard work amen it's a little bit after we met sister gloria and honest oh recounty too and so by the grace of god we thank the lord for them coming by us tonight while he was up speaking i thought about he was wasn't married very long maybe a few years and i thought about the time he came by the house i think i was able to stand with a brother named brother hicks and he came by he was working construction and he had a a hernia on his side and it was about the size of um orange or maybe a grapefruit and he pulled his shirt up and i knew he had a family and i knew he had to take care of the family time was a little hard back then i looked at it and i thought about the family and we prayed a simple prayer and we looked back and it was gone i said when he was up here i don't know something said say something about that i don't know and that's just to see god be god amen so many wonderful things so many testimonies then we can share how god done so many miracles so many supernatural things i remember when god was just bringing us into the word of the hour and there wasn't i remember sister gloria you said eloise those and power god was so great and they was excited because they saw the pill of fire and then one of the brothers that's been in the word for a while extra sister gloria what color was the light was it blue and then she was describing it and he knew it was the blue light it was the devil so that's why you had those blue lights in the gloves but she was selling about an amber color and so forth and she was all in the spirit telling it and i was just smiling because you know we're just coming into the revelation of the word and god was vindicating the word with pillars of fire and supernatural signs and oneness and the people were trying to get us off track trying to say that what we had was the devil amen but god was vindicating amen praise god with supernatural the blind eyes open and then different things like that the dead raising and all that god was just vindicating amen he's a supernatural god that same god amen somebody says he he he never ever left us he's still here right now doing the same things you know sometimes we're wondering sometimes what god why not me amen it's for you too praise god god still doing the same things you know when i think about sister betty when she was laying there just telling testimonies after testimony just a miracle to be on that ventilator for almost four months and to come out of the hospital and the people kept telling her what a testimony what a testimony i said god's still gone he's still doing the same thing he still raises the dead because she she kept saying i thought i was dead [Music] because she saw people that had died praise god so i'm saying god is still gone still raises the dead he still brings the supernatural and the miracle working power of god all you got to do is tap into it praise god if you live the life and you trust god that all things are possible to them to believe it's nothing too hard for the lord praise god you got to look away to jesus turn aside amen praise god i thank god tonight for the word and thank god for everyone and god bless you let us just stand if you be willing and obedient you'll eat the fat of the land but you got to be willing and you got to be obedient are you with me let us spell father in jesus name what a wonder you are you're the same god that does supernatural things you're the same god that promised to restore all
