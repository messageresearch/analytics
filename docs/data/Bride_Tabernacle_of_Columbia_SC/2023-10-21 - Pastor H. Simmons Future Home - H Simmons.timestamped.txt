[37:41] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[37:44] Earth was passed away and there were no
[37:46] more
[37:47] sea and our John saw the holy city New
[37:50] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[37:53] Heaven prepared as a bride of johnfer
[37:56] her
[37:57] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[38:00] Heaven saying behold the tabernac of God
[38:03] is with
[38:04] men and he will dwell with them and they
[38:08] shall be his
[38:10] people and God himself
[38:13] shall be with them and be their
[38:18] God and God shall wipe away all tears
[38:22] from their
[38:23] eyes and there shall be no more
[38:27] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[38:30] shall there be any more
[38:32] pain for the former things have passed
[38:37] away and he that set it upon the throne
[38:41] said behold I make all things
[38:45] new and he said unto me right for these
[38:50] words are true and
[38:53] faithful and he said unto me it is
[38:58] done I am Alpha and
[39:01] Omega the beginning and the
[39:04] end and I will give unto him that is of
[39:08] thirst of the Fountain of the Water of
[39:13] Life
[39:15] freely he that overcometh shall inherit
[39:18] all
[39:20] things and I will be his
[39:23] God and he shall be my
[39:27] son but the
[39:29] fearful and the unbelieving and the
[39:33] Abominable and murderers and H mongers
[39:37] and
[39:38] Sorcerers and idolators and all liars
[39:42] shall have their part in the
[39:44] lake which burn with fire and
[39:48] brimstone which is the second death may
[39:52] God bless the this word you may be
[39:55] seated
[39:59] you know I said on last night I
[40:04] said the people that's on their way to
[40:08] the Lake of Fire are preparing
[40:10] themselves for the
[40:13] lake they're actually getting
[40:16] ready and preparing
[40:19] themselves for the place that they think
[40:24] they want to go
[40:27] but we're talking about our future home
[40:30] you and I but there is a place
[40:34] that the wicked is going to go and
[40:37] there's a place that the righteous is
[40:39] going to
[40:43] go I'm going tell you
[40:46] something people are dressing like they
[40:49] are going
[40:54] somewhere they actually
[40:57] uh of being so inspired
[41:04] by the underworld of the pits of the
[41:08] demonic spirits of the Satan till they
[41:12] are actually becoming one with the uh
[41:16] demon
[41:18] powers so much and so they tattoo
[41:22] themselves even in their
[41:25] faces
[41:26] the Bible tells us not to cut ourselves
[41:29] and put marks in our
[41:33] flesh but people do they pay God in
[41:37] attention no they don't want to pay God
[41:40] even so-called Christians are putting
[41:43] Mark in their
[41:46] flesh and they they were saying don't
[41:49] put marks after the dead and
[41:54] all so there are people of putting marks
[41:57] and uh family members and all kind of
[42:00] things that they
[42:04] do tattoo and they're piercing
[42:09] themselves
[42:12] through with all kind of piing and stuff
[42:16] like that being anointed by demons to do
[42:21] these
[42:23] things and when you look at them
[42:27] if you actually will just look you might
[42:31] run for your
[42:33] life but it become
[42:36] normal that we see
[42:39] amen what we might would see in a
[42:43] nightmare or a bad dream we see it walk
[42:46] in the streets
[42:50] now we say God have
[42:54] mercy because people think that this is
[42:57] nice looking because the devil has so
[43:00] blinded their eyes and inspired them
[43:03] from the pits of hell today cannot
[43:06] understand that they're preparing
[43:09] themselves for where they are
[43:13] going and they don't want to go there
[43:16] but because they don't want God they are
[43:20] going there
[43:24] anyhow people dress like they don't
[43:29] care the Bible says it's abomination in
[43:32] the sight of God for the woman to we
[43:34] that which pertain it to a
[43:36] man and if a man put on a woman's
[43:39] garment it's
[43:42] Abomination but folk don't
[43:45] care they're going to do what they
[43:49] want it's time for us to understand you
[43:53] going to prepare yourself for your home
[43:56] home with
[43:59] God are we going to disrespect God and
[44:03] we going to prepare ourselves to go the
[44:06] other
[44:09] way it's easy to see a man with a dress
[44:16] on and he says I'm fully
[44:22] man these to see things that
[44:27] maybe uh 50 years ago SE 75 years ago
[44:32] people wouldn't dare
[44:36] do people don't mind walking the streets
[44:39] in they under
[44:41] closed what we would call under closed

[46:41] for a woman the way that which pertain
[46:42] it to a man and the man to put on a
[46:44] woman's
[46:45] garment are you with
[46:47] me somebody
[46:49] said everything anybody can do anything
[46:52] now but I believe that God that's why

[1:26:01] today but all I can think about Lord
[1:26:08] is sometimes how we fail
[1:26:12] you what a disappointing time it'll
[1:26:17] be when we spend our time with all kind
[1:26:20] of things and not that which is
[1:26:21] important
[1:26:25] that is
[1:26:27] appreciating all you done for
[1:26:30] us appreciating our every step and our
[1:26:33] every breath that we
[1:26:37] breathe say Lord I I I I'm not thankful
[1:26:42] enough Lord I I I haven't appreciated
[1:26:46] your love and your goodness
[1:26:50] enough sometimes Lord I just take things
[1:26:53] for
[1:26:55] granted but Lord I want to
[1:26:58] stop and I want to take time and to say
[1:27:01] God I thank you every
[1:27:04] day thank you every moment every hour
[1:27:08] God thank
[1:27:10] you thank you for being patient with me
