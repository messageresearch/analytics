[35:40] spirit of God they are the sons of
[35:42] God
[35:48] 1124 this old message God servant spoke
[35:53] by faith Moses
[35:58] and he
[36:00] says by faith excuse me that's a 24
[36:05] let's go to 23 please it said by faith
[36:10] Moses by faith Moses when he was born
[36:14] was hid three months of his parents
[36:19] because they saw he was a proper child
[36:25] and they were not afraid of the king
[36:27] Commandments 24 church will you
[36:38] read chosen rather to suffer Affliction
[36:41] with the people of God then enjoy the
[36:44] pledges of sin for a season
[36:56] 26 by SL he forsook Egypt not fearing
[37:01] the Wrath of the king for he endured as
[37:05] Sin him who is what invisible
[37:11] invisible I'll stop there God bless the
[37:14] reading this word you may be
[37:18] seated you know it's something to see
[37:20] him who's
[37:23] invisible Amen to see him who is
[37:26] invisible by faith he saw him who is
[37:30] invisible to cease him that's invisible
[37:35] you saw it thank God by
[37:38] faith you know I I I I thought on uh
[37:42] Moses in his
[37:44] decision and we must make the right
[37:49] choice making the right
[37:51] choice we must
[37:54] choose we make many choices in life but
[37:58] when it comes down
[38:01] to your Eternal
[38:05] Destiny something
[38:07] about something about within us
[38:11] it's everybody don't have that everybody
[38:15] that walks to Earth though Jesus died
[38:18] for the sins of the whole world and
[38:20] everybody just don't have that thing
[38:23] that uh as sister kha was saying I want
[38:26] to please God
[38:28] everybody don't have that desire that
[38:32] thought in their heart and that thought
[38:34] in their mind that I want to please God
[38:37] everybody don't even uh uh even want to
[38:42] serve the Lord even want to but it it is
[38:45] a hunger and thirst in
[38:47] everyone the young people today that
[38:50] says you know I'm
[38:53] spiritual H where this coming from I'm
[38:57] spiritual
[38:59] uh you know I I don't read the Bible I
[39:01] don't go to church but I'm
[39:06] spiritual and I'm hearing that more more
[39:10] especially because I guess I'm around a
[39:12] lot of black people I'm hearing that out
[39:14] of the youth in the black community I'm
[39:19] spiritual so you can't tell them you
[39:22] know that that's wrong to do cuz I'm
[39:25] spiritual it's all right with with
[39:28] my I don't know what they call it I
[39:32] don't know where they at but by by the
[39:35] grace of God we have a a
[39:38] Bible that people used to
[39:42] respect you know but nowadays we don't
[39:46] know whether people respect the word of
[39:49] God we used to
[39:51] respected when I was a little boy coming
[39:54] up in school elementary you know you
[39:56] said the prayer
[39:58] and they went around the class and you
[39:59] had to say thou sh not steal thou sh not
[40:03] do this you know say a
[40:05] Commandment that was in public school
[40:09] everybody you know s a little verse had
[40:14] prayer first pledge of leing to the flag
[40:16] and stuff like that and you went through
[40:18] the Bible that there no fear of God they
[40:22] took prayer out of the school you can't
[40:23] pray you can't can't do this so the
[40:26] world is gotten so terrible so
[40:32] lost they
[40:35] said they got to do something with the
[40:38] Supreme Court now because they
[40:42] bias C our Supreme Court is no good no
[40:47] more because they're not judging by the
[40:49] law they're judging by the
[40:53] politics whether I'm a Republican or
[40:56] whether I'm a Democrat
[40:58] and they have no checking balance nobody
[41:00] can check them whatever they say it's
[41:04] final so they said we got to do
[41:07] something brothers and sisters we're
[41:09] headed the country is falling apart
[41:12] everything is falling
[41:16] apart coming to church and the church
[41:18] could be
[41:21] political and we know that the
[41:24] denominational world is political
[41:28] am it's going to be one world order one
[41:30] World Church and the World Council of
[41:32] churches you got to be a part of it if
[41:34] you ain't a part of it amen and to be a
[41:38] part of it you spiritually you're
[41:41] dead a lot of churches are already a
[41:43] part of it spiritually
[41:45] dead you dive when you go into it are
[41:49] you with me
[41:51] spiritually are you with
[41:53] me so in Deuter Romans
[41:57] 30 Moses made a decision a conscious
[42:00] decision you and I are in this world and
[42:04] how come I got to make a decision can I
[42:07] just can I just be
[42:10] me do I have to do I need to make a
[42:14] decision can I be
[42:17] me what's wrong with me being
[42:20] me can I just live can I just exist and
[42:26] just be
[42:30] me and I think sometimes we feel
[42:35] Untouchable and I don't want nobody to
[42:38] invade my
[42:41] privacy so I want to be me so leave me
[42:49] alone life is not like
[42:53] that you going to be invaded one way or
[42:56] another whether you like it or
[42:59] not somebody going to interrupt your
[43:03] privacy and you going to have to you
[43:06] know make decisions that you don't want
[43:08] to
[43:10] make all you got to do is live a little
[43:13] while and you'll find yourself you have
[43:15] to make sound
[43:18] decisions you have to make choices in
[43:21] life you got to make choices whether not
[43:24] I want to do right or whether I want to
[43:27] hang out with the gang and whether I
[43:30] want to be a gang banger or whether not
[43:32] I want to be a Christian or whether not
[43:34] I want to
[43:36] be go to school go to college whether or
[43:39] not I want to a a career I want to take
[43:42] a trade I have to make a decision in
[43:45] life because I got to have something to
[43:47] be able to help me to navigate through
[43:50] life if I'm going to live on the earth I
[43:53] got to have some tools to navigate and I
[43:57] I want to I want I want to be
[44:01] comfortable so I got to do something
[44:03] what I want to if I just want to exist
[44:05] and I want to just hang out I got to
[44:07] find myself I got to find what I want
[44:11] what I want to be what I I got to make a
[44:14] decision get in high school and I said
[44:17] your best time in your life y'all young
[44:19] people best time in your life enjoy
[44:22] it cuz after a while you're going to

[51:15] okay I got
[51:17] it but I had to get a little older
[51:19] during High School I couldn't make those
[51:22] decisions because people made decisions
[51:25] for you you know I wasn't ready to to do
[51:29] those things that they wanted me to do I
[51:32] wasn't prepared to do it I wasn't ready
[51:35] I didn't know what was going on you see
[51:38] I don't know what I'm talking about this
[51:40] morning why I'm talking about this some
[51:43] things you ain't ready for but you feel
[51:47] pushed into it when you ain't ready for
[51:50] it you don't know how to handle it and
[51:52] you ain't ready to handle it but
[51:54] sometime you're pushed into it
[51:59] are you with me so you begin to accept
[52:02] it because you don't want to be left out
[52:05] and look like
[52:10] you you don't fit
[52:13] in you're not a
[52:15] part so the
[52:18] decisions that you
[52:21] make sometimes it's to satisfy not you
[52:25] but it's to satisfy the
[52:28] crowd your choices is not that I'm
[52:32] making this choice that I want to make
[52:34] it I'm making this choice because I
[52:36] don't want to
[52:38] feel left
[52:40] out are you with me though I'm not ready
[52:44] to make the decision I'm being pushed
[52:47] I'm being pressured into making
[52:49] decisions that I don't want to make
[52:52] right now I'm me I'm not ready for these
[53:00] decisions not
[53:05] ready so somebody believe that it's your
[53:09] season it's your time you should make
[53:12] this decision and you make decisions and
[53:17] once a decision is made sometime we uh
[53:21] what we do we make the decision and then
[53:24] we're sorry
[53:27] I'm sorry sorry sorry I made the
[53:32] decision
[53:34] but here's a decision that you can make
[53:37] here is a you can make the right choice
[53:42] this
[53:43] morning the right choice when it comes
[53:46] down to your soul and what where you
[53:48] going to spend eternity you can make a
[53:52] sound solid decision in your sound
[53:58] mind amen understanding that nobody's
[54:02] pushing me nobody's trying to make me do
[54:05] it it's out of my own desire I want to
[54:10] please God I want to serve God I want I
[54:15] love
[54:20] God it's my
[54:23] decision nobody making me do it nobody
[54:27] forcing me into
[54:28] it
[54:31] okay he
[54:41] says I call
[54:44] record um you
[54:46] choose
[54:48] life
[54:51] amen I said before you this day the 19th
[54:54] verse it says that I have set before you
[54:57] life and death blessing and
[55:00] cursing therefore
[55:03] what choose life that
[55:07] both thou and thou seed May what live
[55:12] now let's back up to the 14th verse of
[55:14] the same chapter 30th
[55:20] chapter it says but the word is very n
[55:24] thee in thy mouth mouth and in thy heart
[55:29] that thou may do it 15th verse says see
[55:33] I set before you this day
[55:37] what life in good you know have you
[55:41] thought about it if you thought about
[55:44] you just walking through life and just
[55:46] you know just doing and not even
[55:48] recognizing that God is
[55:51] say I set before
[55:53] you life and good but you know you don't
[55:57] understand I'm just passing through I'm
[55:59] not even considering that I I'm makeing
[56:02] I made a
[56:03] decision I'm I my lifestyle is the
[56:07] decision is a product of the decision
[56:10] that I
[56:11] made I made I chose this lifestyle e
[56:16] even if I was persuaded by others even
[56:19] if I was push or pressing into it I made
[56:23] the decision
[56:26] are you with me so he
[56:33] says life and good then he says and
[56:38] what death and
[56:42] evil when you say

[57:55] I get there 24
[58:03] and4 it says now therefore feel what
[58:09] feel the Lord and
[58:12] what you know a lot of people serving
[58:14] the lord but not
[58:17] in they're not
[58:19] sincere they sing they you know they
[58:22] come to church but they people ain't a
[58:25] lot of times it's not
[58:27] sincerity a not they're not in it their
[58:30] heart is not in
[58:32] it they're not
[58:34] sincere about their walk with God when
[58:38] you when you really sincere about you
[58:41] know some people come to
[58:43] work I I used to wor people didn't care
[58:47] about the patience and I looked at them
[58:49] and I look at the patient suffering and
[58:51] I say
[58:53] okay I remember
[58:56] uh this lady she was a little
[58:58] overweight and then they bought her back
[59:01] from someplace and she was on the
[59:04] stretcher it looked like the stretcher
[59:07] was pressing her body and I said I
[59:11] looked at her I said oh I
[59:13] see but I saw her
[59:16] crying I says okay I know if I call for
[59:20] help and nobody want to help me I said
[59:23] somehow I got to get her out of this
[59:25] pain
[59:26] so I kind of put the brakes on the
[59:28] stretcher and I put the sheet and pull
[59:31] one side other side and I put it in the
[59:36] bed I had
[59:40] others I pull back the sheet and they
[59:43] all saw and
[59:45] everything nice clean white sheet on top
[59:49] like somebody has washed them and took
[59:51] taken care of then I look at it and I
[59:54] see
[59:56] the bed swords and all and I
[59:59] just this is what I got so I got to
[1:00:04] clean them off I got to take care of the
[1:00:06] bed soes I got to do this because
[1:00:09] somebody don't people have been
[1:00:11] negligent they're working they get a
[1:00:13] paycheck but they ain't to sure about
[1:00:15] what they
[1:00:16] doing are you with me they're hard in it
[1:00:19] they just want the
[1:00:21] paycheck and a lot of folks you know
[1:00:23] they just want to go to heaven I just
[1:00:25] want to go to heaven
[1:00:28] but my heart is not in but I said you
[1:00:32] know it's something about when you're
[1:00:34] different it's something about when God
[1:00:38] you
[1:00:39] know I was just coming to the Lord and
[1:00:42] my first patient had everything they say
[1:00:45] in the book I said my brother said you
[1:00:48] know what I would have done I to put the
[1:00:51] Sheep back over I come up and that would
[1:00:54] have been it I would going to do that

[1:01:01] cuz he wasn't going to do it you know
[1:01:03] what I'm
[1:01:04] saying and I said I
[1:01:07] couldn't you know my Tears start coming
[1:01:09] to my eyes I why did it people leave
[1:01:12] this person in this condition you know
[1:01:15] what I'm

[1:02:12] for
[1:02:14] it so I said well I don't I I can't find
[1:02:18] myself the
[1:02:21] decisions they wanted because they saw
[1:02:25] that you car
[1:02:27] when people see you care you don't know
[1:02:30] who's looking at you and see that you
[1:02:34] care evidently it had

[1:02:56] okay so by the grace of God when you
[1:02:59] don't even know what's going on behind
[1:03:01] the
[1:03:02] scene you give your best to
[1:03:05] God somehow the angels are reporting to
[1:03:10] God they are saying to God you
[1:03:14] see that's one of your faithful
[1:03:19] children are you with me even the devil
[1:03:23] told God that I uh Jo I know he's
[1:03:27] serving you but he ain't serving you for
[1:03:29] nothing you got to hedge about
[1:03:32] him are you with
[1:03:36] me he he he didn't say you know Jo God
[1:03:40] what you saying about Job ain't right
[1:03:42] but you got a hedge about him but if if
[1:03:44] you move the
[1:03:45] Hedge I'll make him curse you to your
[1:03:49] face what happens if the hedges move
[1:03:53] what happens if God desire to test you
[1:03:55] what decision would you make would you
[1:03:59] run would you give up on God will you
[1:04:01] say God I don't want you no more I don't
[1:04:04] serve you no more I don't believe you no
[1:04:08] more because you shouldn't have let this
[1:04:10] happen to
[1:04:18] me sometimes we don't know we're going
[1:04:21] through a test and we're going through a
[1:04:23] trial and we don't understand why
[1:04:27] but how are we conducting Our
[1:04:31] Lives how are we handing the
[1:04:37] pressure the decision the
[1:04:41] choice when we are at the
[1:04:45] lowest what kind of choice do we
[1:04:48] make do we make the right choice do we
[1:04:52] choose to do the right thing
[1:04:55] when everybody else want to do the wrong
[1:04:58] thing am I going to do the right
[1:05:06] thing I'm being pressured I'm being
[1:05:09] pull I don't want to do it but I got to
[1:05:12] CH in because everybody else is doing
[1:05:17] it the choice that when the spies came
[1:05:22] back to spy out the land they made a
[1:05:24] decision that we can't take the
[1:05:28] Land There was 12 of them it was 10 said
[1:05:32] we're not
[1:05:33] able but there was only two that made
[1:05:37] the right
[1:05:39] decision we're more than able to
[1:05:42] dick and to the eyesight they
[1:05:48] couldn't because they were looking at
[1:05:51] amen look like amen the the walls was
[1:05:55] high
[1:05:56] the the the they were fortified and it
[1:06:00] was impossible for them to do
[1:06:05] it but something about Joshua and Caleb
[1:06:09] inside of them that said With
[1:06:11] God all
[1:06:14] things all things are
[1:06:17] possible we can we can the land is ours
[1:06:20] we can take it because God gave it to
[1:06:24] us God gave it to us I make the right
[1:06:27] decision amen if about to stand by
[1:06:31] myself of all the everybody else in the
[1:06:34] church want to go with them let them
