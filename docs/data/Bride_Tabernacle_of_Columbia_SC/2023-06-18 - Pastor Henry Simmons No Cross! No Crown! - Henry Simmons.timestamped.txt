[53:09] regardless of what we've been through
[53:11] what we're going through amen
[53:13] God is good amen
[53:16] it seem a little quiet and looked like
[53:18] we're missing quite a number this
[53:20] morning but I still God is still good
[53:25] still love the Lord
[53:27] still pressing the Bible
[53:30] I was so excited this morning I just I I
[53:34] find myself just speaking in tongue
[53:37] because I was so excited about
[53:40] the goodness of the Lord
[53:46] and just feasting
[53:49] you couldn't keep still sometimes so you
[53:51] get up and just walk around
[53:54] and just thank the Lord for his goodness
[53:57] you know sometimes amen
[54:00] uh folks amen if you don't experience
[54:03] the goodness of God it's an individual
[54:05] thing
[54:07] you as individuals got to you know pray
[54:10] and got to dedicate yourself to the Lord
[54:13] praise God I can't bring you on fire you
[54:15] got to have your own liquefier
[54:18] amen your all is your amen
[54:22] when it's time to buy you gotta buy for
[54:24] yourself
[54:25] it's an individual walk amen it's not a
[54:28] church it's not a group walk it's an
[54:30] individual
[54:32] amen it's God deals with you as an
[54:35] individual
[54:36] you can't look for the one that's
[54:38] sitting next to you and wanting to set
[54:40] behind you in front of you it's an
[54:42] individual wall
[54:44] no cross
[54:46] no crown
[54:48] oh you will
[54:50] so he says here and uh
[54:53] Matthew 16 24
[54:57] then said Jesus unto his disciples
[55:00] If any man come after me let him what
[55:05] we have a problem with that
[55:07] we have a problem because too much of us
[55:10] is in the way
[55:12] too much of uh
[55:14] see if a man deny himself you know Jesus
[55:18] said not my will but let what
[55:20] let your will be done in my life I want
[55:24] God to will for my life
[55:26] but when you get to know Jesus or get to
[55:30] come in contact with Jesus Jesus Jesus
[55:33] revealed to you who you are
[55:37] because sometimes we think that we are a
[55:42] man of one persuasion or another
[55:44] persuasion we have our life already
[55:46] mapped out
[55:48] but God planned for us and God's purpose
[55:51] for our lives may be all together
[55:53] different from what we think that we
[55:56] ought to be and what we want to be or
[55:58] what we should be
[56:00] God has amen his own expectation of you
[56:05] and I
[56:06] you know I thought about in Galatians 4
[56:09] it talks about uh because we are Sons
[56:12] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[56:14] into our hearts whereby we cry out by
[56:16] father
[56:18] he didn't say amen he said because ye
[56:21] are Sons
[56:22] amen God gives us the Holy Ghost because
[56:24] of who we are you know I I thought about
[56:28] we cannot make you worship God or serve
[56:32] God mama can't make your daddy can't
[56:34] make it it doesn't matter how much Holy
[56:37] Ghost falls on you amen whatever's in
[56:40] you when the rainfall that's what's
[56:43] going to come up
[56:45] amen when the Holy Ghost fall on you you
[56:48] cannot be a Son of God if you never were
[56:52] you a man
[56:54] so you cannot live a Christian Life
[56:57] until amen unless God had ordained you
[57:01] before the foundation of the world to
[57:03] live it I don't care what family you're
[57:04] in I don't care who your mama or your
[57:07] daddy is except you were predestinated
[57:10] in the mind of God before the foundation
[57:13] of the world you will never be able to
[57:16] become a Son of God except you were with
[57:18] God from the beginning
[57:21] I could never be a Simmons amen unless
[57:24] and I was in my daddy
[57:26] are you up man
[57:28] so I have a father amen
[57:31] you know he cried we cried out my father
[57:34] that God is our father isn't it we're
[57:36] Sons and Daughters of God why others
[57:39] don't have that relationship
[57:42] they don't have that amen though they
[57:45] can set in the church and become a
[57:46] church member that can join the church
[57:48] and they can go through all emotions you
[57:50] can never become a son except you were
[57:54] in the father from the beginning
[57:57] are you up man
[57:59] praise God it's by amen by germ seed by
[58:03] or amen full knowledge of God that he
[58:06] foresaw you
[58:08] amen and that's why those Sons and
[58:10] Daughters of God when they're here the
[58:13] Sheep the the shepherd voice they're
[58:16] able to respond others cannot respond
[58:20] they may jump they may shout they've
[58:22] been speaking tongues but the life would
[58:25] never be there
[58:27] amen the only kind of Life they can
[58:29] fruits they can bear is corrupt fruit
[58:32] oh you want me but if the life of Jesus
[58:36] Christ be there
[58:38] if the life of God be there there are
[58:41] bad good fruit
[58:43] and their fruits shall remain why
[58:46] because they got the bloodline of the
[58:49] father
[58:50] they met there of God and their children
[58:53] of God and they're going to bring forth
[58:55] the word of God because they are seed of
[58:59] God
[59:00] are you with me
[59:02] and I want you to know on this Father's
[59:04] Day that we have a father
[59:07] and in my father's Kingdom In My
[59:09] Father's House there are many palaces if
[59:14] it were not so I would have told you
[59:16] amen and he's gone away to prepare
[59:19] please for us
[59:21] that where he is that we may be also
[59:25] are you a man God has a place prepared
[59:29] for you

[59:37] to the church
[59:39] others that don't meet a thing because
[59:42] it's not amen he's not their father

[1:01:04] this present time amen no cross
[1:01:08] no crime amen
[1:01:10] maybe I
[1:01:12] veered a little bit but thank God for
[1:01:15] the Holy Ghost

[1:01:20] God is a good god

[1:01:25] that
[1:01:26] First Timothy I mean second Timothy 3
[1:01:28] you don't have to turn second Timothy 3

[1:01:58] want a crown but they don't want what
[1:02:00] goes along with get that crime
[1:02:02] and see all that will live Godly not not
[1:02:05] some of us
[1:02:06] amen people think that when they're
[1:02:09] going to and they're being persecuted
[1:02:11] amen I don't deserve to be persecuted
[1:02:15] amen no you're done that's why you act
[1:02:17] like you act that's how you take
[1:02:19] chastisement some folk get mad at Mom
[1:02:22] and Daddy some folk run away from home
[1:02:24] some folks choose not to obey and not to
[1:02:27] respect Mom and Daddy
[1:02:30] oh you want me but you know what happens
[1:02:32] to those type of children
[1:02:35] are you with me
[1:02:36] that cannot ex respect mama and daddy
[1:02:40] amen they get this set in a lot of
[1:02:42] trouble
[1:02:43] they find a lot of problems in life
[1:02:46] they cannot handle life in a situation
[1:02:49] amen but just have time to get you ready
[1:02:54] Amen to handle the things that you're
[1:02:56] going to face in life so Mom and Daddy
[1:02:59] correction is trying to get you ready
[1:03:01] for Life Experiences
[1:03:04] but some of us won't take it
[1:03:08] praise God
[1:03:10] and we run from correction
[1:03:14] we don't listen to those that amen
[1:03:17] already passed that way before already
[1:03:19] experienced some hardships and some pain
[1:03:22] and some trouble amen and they're trying
[1:03:24] to keep you from experiencing what they
[1:03:26] experience in life
[1:03:28] are you up there
[1:03:30] but yet we we choose our own path as
[1:03:34] though mama and daddy don't know
[1:03:38] but they already experienced the hurt
[1:03:41] and the pain and the Sorrows of life
[1:03:43] and they're trying to keep you away from
[1:03:45] a lot of trouble
[1:03:47] are you
[1:03:50] so sometimes we disregard disrespect and
[1:03:54] sometimes when it comes down to the word
[1:03:56] of God we have uh those that are
[1:03:59] children of God have respect for the
[1:04:01] word of God those that are not amen
[1:04:03] though they said in church though they
[1:04:04] go through the motion play their tithes
[1:04:06] and the offering and all the good things
[1:04:08] they do amen amen none of that would
[1:04:11] save them
[1:04:12] yet in their spirit in their heart their
[1:04:14] disobedient children
[1:04:16] because when it comes down to opening
[1:04:19] the word of God and living for God they
[1:04:21] cannot live it don't matter how much
[1:04:23] Holy Ghost for all look at how much they
[1:04:25] shout how much they speak in tongue they
[1:04:27] still gonna do their own thing
[1:04:30] praise God no my no matter what how much
[1:04:33] the love of God is available for them no
[1:04:36] matter how many blessings are available
[1:04:37] to them in the kingdom of God they
[1:04:40] cannot see Their Blessings they want to
[1:04:42] make their own blessings
[1:04:44] they want to do their own thing
[1:04:47] they want to aim and bless themselves
[1:04:50] amen but God has a His blessings are
[1:04:53] beyond that which we can answer we can
[1:04:55] think
[1:04:56] God got so much better for us but we
[1:04:59] cannot receive God a better because we
[1:05:02] think amen that we can get our own
[1:05:05] righteousness oh you want me
[1:05:08] that's a generation that appearing on
[1:05:10] our own eyes but yet they have not been
[1:05:11] washed under filthiness that way there's
[1:05:14] a way to seem right to a man but the way
[1:05:16] they are
[1:05:19] death
[1:05:20] are you up man
[1:05:23] see sometimes we want to make our own
[1:05:25] way and do our own thing but we don't
[1:05:27] want to obey God
[1:05:29] we have a father that we got to respect
[1:05:32] and here's the word
[1:05:34] Jesus said when you see me you see the
[1:05:36] father
[1:05:37] amen praise God
[1:05:39] and he said I am a father of one
[1:05:41] the Bible said in the beginning with the
[1:05:43] word the word was with God and word
[1:05:45] what's God and the Word was made flesh
[1:05:47] are you with me so God comes down the
[1:05:50] logos of God the spirit of God come down
[1:05:53] make himself a body gets inside of the
[1:05:55] body the Bible said that God was in
[1:05:58] Christ
[1:05:59] to reconcile the world to him self isn't
[1:06:03] that right he came down to die for our
[1:06:06] sins and that we might not go amen into
[1:06:09] the Lake of Fire amen he suffered for us
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:13] he didn't have to do it but he did it
[1:06:15] because he loved you
[1:06:16] because he cared for you he loved you
[1:06:18] enough Amen to take your pain and take
[1:06:21] your shame
[1:06:22] are you with me
[1:06:24] so because he took our pain and our
[1:06:26] shame amen praise God they stripped the
[1:06:29] neck and he was that was uh that was his
[1:06:33] it was all shame
[1:06:35] that they stripped him naked and they
[1:06:37] nailed those Nails in his hand and they
[1:06:39] crucified him because he had done
[1:06:42] nothing wrong
[1:06:43] amen it was what we did and what we're
[1:06:46] doing now amen we're ashamed of him amen
[1:06:50] amen because amen because we don't love
[1:06:53] him
[1:06:54] we're ashamed of him
[1:06:56] we're ashamed of the Cross but he said
[1:06:58] if any man come after me
[1:07:01] are you with me
[1:07:03] for before you can get to Jesus he said
[1:07:05] let him what
[1:07:07] deny himself
[1:07:09] well we don't want to do that
[1:07:11] we think that I can I can have part of
[1:07:14] me and then I can still get dark no
[1:07:18] you got to deny yourself
[1:07:21] none of you God don't need nothing you
[1:07:23] have
[1:07:24] and you can't bring none of that over
[1:07:27] here in the kingdom of God
[1:07:29] not your money not your education not
[1:07:32] your knowledge not your wisdom God don't
[1:07:34] need nothing you got
[1:07:36] what God has for you amen is far beyond
[1:07:40] what you can ever imagine
[1:07:43] praise God what haven't even entered
[1:07:46] into your heart what God has prepared
[1:07:48] for them to love him
[1:07:50] and if you love God you're willing to
[1:07:52] forsake all
[1:07:56] amen this this thing that you're gonna
[1:07:58] bring over are corruptable
[1:08:01] they're not gonna last
[1:08:04] they're only temporary
[1:08:07] so I don't want nothing that you can
[1:08:09] bring over here because we are not
[1:08:11] talking about a corruptible crowd but
[1:08:14] we're talking about a word
[1:08:16] an Incorruptible crime so the life that
[1:08:19] God has given you is not a temporary
[1:08:22] life a life that's gonna last for a few
[1:08:26] years
[1:08:27] but we're talking about eternal life
[1:08:31] so with this eternal life God has
[1:08:34] prepared a place for you to live
[1:08:38] are you with me
[1:08:39] so God is talking about eternal life a
[1:08:42] life that you your flesh know nothing of
[1:08:46] praise God this world know nothing of
[1:08:49] so God's going to introduce you to
[1:08:51] another dimension
[1:08:53] he's going to translate you from the
[1:08:55] power of Darkness into the kingdom of
[1:08:57] his dear son
[1:08:58] amen the only way you could come in the
[1:09:01] Kingdom of his son is that you were
[1:09:03] chosen and ordained of God before the
[1:09:05] foundation of the world to come others
[1:09:08] that can't even hear don't mean a thing
[1:09:09] they come to church they don't hear
[1:09:11] nothing
[1:09:12] they don't believe nothing and they
[1:09:14] don't care whether they uh whatever the
[1:09:16] preacher's saying don't mean a thing to
[1:09:17] them they have no regarding they
[1:09:20] disregard the word
[1:09:22] amen because they have established their
[1:09:24] own righteousness
[1:09:26] they're already in themselves think I'm
[1:09:28] all right
[1:09:29] everything gonna be all right I'm all
[1:09:31] right
[1:09:32] well you got to get rid of that
[1:09:34] self-righteousness
[1:09:36] you got to realize that I need God and I
[1:09:38] need God more than ever
[1:09:42] no matter how much Holy Ghost you got
[1:09:44] amen your body gonna Echo
[1:09:48] and no and that devil gonna bring the
[1:09:50] old
[1:09:51] flashback and Paul says there's a war
[1:09:54] going on in my mind
[1:09:56] so the devil is going to fight your mind
[1:09:58] it's going to battle you every day
[1:10:01] you can't wake up in the morning without
[1:10:03] a fight
[1:10:05] praise God but you fighting for a
[1:10:07] purpose
[1:10:08] amen I got a purpose implant in mind
[1:10:12] Hallelujah
[1:10:14] sometimes folks will give up
[1:10:16] Paul said I fought a good fight
[1:10:19] I kept the faith
[1:10:21] amen I know there's a crime of life
[1:10:24] amen a crowd of righteousness a crime of
[1:10:27] life amen it's waiting on me there
[1:10:30] amen praise God you got amen we should
[1:10:34] wear a crown brother

[1:11:06] and that is the righteousness of the
[1:11:08] Saints isn't that right

[1:11:25] rejected the men

[1:11:31] was no beauty that this flesh desired of
[1:11:33] him
[1:11:34] are you a man
[1:11:36] you don't try to be beautiful in this
[1:11:39] world Amen try to be holy

[1:25:40] are you a man

[1:25:56] realizing that I'm in it
[1:25:59] for the glory of God
[1:26:01] if that's the way God chooses to make me
[1:26:05] perfect then Lord let me recognize that

[1:26:26] it I told everybody about the law
[1:26:29] Endeavor lied on me
[1:26:32] and he told a lie on me and he talked
[1:26:35] about me and she talked about me and he
[1:26:38] did this he did that no cross
[1:26:42] are you with me on that job I just told
[1:26:45] him a piece of my mind because I was
[1:26:48] tired though I was a Christian I won't
[1:26:50] let nobody mess over me
[1:26:53] foreign
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:27:03] fortitude
[1:27:09] it fortifieds us sometimes and keeps us
[1:27:12] in the mindset that
[1:27:16] we fill a wall around us
[1:27:19] because our attitude began to develop
[1:27:22] our character
[1:27:24] are you with me our character is being
[1:27:27] formed how we react to our trials and
[1:27:31] our temptation
[1:27:33] so we become characterized not as a
[1:27:35] Christian character but our character
[1:27:38] becomes one of a corrupt nature
[1:27:41] one of a Fight Fire With Fire
[1:27:45] One That Ain't Gonna Take No Mess off of
[1:27:47] nobody
[1:27:50] are you with me
[1:27:51] but when we let God fight our battles
[1:27:55] as we God I'm telling you about it I
[1:27:59] know they did it to me God
[1:28:05] they spit on Jesus
[1:28:08] they stoned Stephen to death they lied
[1:28:11] on him and Jesus said why
[1:28:14] but what
[1:28:19] you don't let them live
[1:28:23] no cross Noah
[1:28:27] we know we don't do that we get out of
[1:28:29] this lord said some of those demons
[1:28:34] because the Angels ain't gonna do it
[1:28:36] isn't it right because God is love amen
[1:28:39] so you say God you know send some of
[1:28:41] those devils and let the god
[1:28:44] you know
[1:28:46] because they can't be a child of God
[1:28:50] the Jews with the eye for an eye too for
