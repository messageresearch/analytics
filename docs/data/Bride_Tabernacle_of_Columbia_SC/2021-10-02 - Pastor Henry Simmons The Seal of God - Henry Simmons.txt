the word of grace in your hand tonight in jesus name amen ephesians 1 we're living in such a dark hour but in the midst of the darkness promise there shall be light in the evening time so we thank god that there is light in the midst of this dark hour that we're living in the darkness is getting thicker and thicker the bible says men hard to fail because of fear the things that's coming upon the earth brother and sister i don't want to be here when the wrath of god in the nation of god is pulled out of his fury i don't know about you but i thank god that his grace is upon our lives right now ephesians 1 and 4. should according as he has chosen us where in him before when that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us into adoption children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will sixth verse to the praise of the glory of his grace when he has made us what acceptable in the in the beloved amen whom we have redemption through his what blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace god bless you in two words you may be seated i tell you just reading this is powerful i'm going to tell you something nothing would take the place of the word of god no quotes of any man myself uh whether it be wesley whether it be luther whether it be whatever nothing would take the place of this bible nothing should be exalted over the word of god are you with me so you gotta understand that nothing nobody nothing should be exalted over this word nothing would take the place prophet of god said if you want to get closer to the lord he said what read the message and pray read what because the bible is the one it's the message see but if you make the message something other than the bible then you've you've lost the whole revelation of the of the message because you've taken something else to make it the message if the message is the bible then read your bible and pray are you with me so we got to understand that we're being restored back to the word are you with me so don't let nothing nothing take the place of your bible or no preacher no quotes no nothing take the place of the bible always see and you can get you can draw nourishment and you can draw strength from this from the word of god are you with me don't let nothing replace that everything else can sound good feel good but the word of god has that nourishment and that nutrients in which the soul needs amen that's the word of life amen praise god everything else can sound better can sound good but the word of god must be exalted above everything are you with me and that's the purpose of the message of the hour to bring us back to the word okay don't let nobody no man deceive you because many folk got this over here and that over there and they make the bible a secondary book are you with me so that's why the blood and the it got me in the seventh verse they make the blood er the blood of 2000 years ago is not for us today the blood of jesus has never lost never lost his power praise god the only way you and i are saved is through the what the blood of jesus without the shedding of blood there's no no remission i'm saying are you with me so don't let nobody down play talk you out of it are you open manipulate maneuver amen the blood of jesus that that's why i hate to stop here for a moment in whom we have redemption through his see it it just sank down in my spirit when when when we read that i said i got to stop we have redemption through his blood amen we had many great preachers many great prophets moses elijah amen jeremiah amen john the baptist amen but redemption is only through the blood of jesus christ are you with me we had great many great prophets many great kings many great priests but he's the high priest of our profession are you up here so let's not i don't know why i got i i mean i went over that way a little bit but keep your eyes focused on one thing if you don't read your bible you you lo you can look at all the internet all the preachers are on the on this and that and if you don't get your substance from this word because yo you know i see why the prophet said read your bible and pray if you want to get close to the lord because you can lose focus you can start looking at men and you can start looking at uh you know what i'm saying this or that he said read your bible and pray okay not say it but do it are you with me a lot of folks have said what he said not do what he said okay it says here redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his what grace the eighth verse of ephesians 1 and 8 when he has met has a bound to toward us in all wisdom and pruitt having made known unto us the mystery of his what [Music] i believe paul was speaking to them now and it's relevant to us now that god has made known unto us the mystery of his will as he did for that particular age he made known the mystery of his will to that age and in our age amen he's made known the mysteries of his will for this age are you with me so you and i must channel in to the mystery of his will for that age as paul said as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation the foundation has been laid it meant the house has been built we had to head so we at the end now we're at the top of are you with me and we're not looking for headship of man we were looking for christ the word to be the headship so the headstone is grace grace okay oh lord it's going to take god stepping out on the scene and doing some things to open the eyes i wasn't going to talk about um when the eyes were open they knew him and then i'm going to i was going to actually what's in your eyes maybe we'll get to that sunday i don't know oh okay it says having made known us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purpose where in himself that in the dispensation of the what he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him in whom also we have attained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the cancer of what his own will that we should be to the what who first trusted in what christ we got to trust him whom in whom ye also trusted after ye heard the word of truth so you got to hear it first not with your ears but see they had ears to hear but they heard not the eye just see but they was blind are you with me so it's got to be a different ear he that has a ear to hear let him hear what the spirit says to the church so the spirit got to be there in order for you to hear without the spirit of god you don't you you don't hear god god is not you know i was thinking about the prophet said little boy was in the mirror he was from a rural place in the country and way back in the country and he came to the city and he never saw a mural before staying with his relatives and they had a mirror and he was looking in the mirror and he didn't know what it was he saw something in the mirror and he was looking and uh as he was looking in the mirror and he did his hand like that did this that and then all of a sudden the boy discovered he had never seen the mirror before but the boy discovered he said that's me you know and what we look in the mirror of the word and we discover that's me amen but you got to see yourself in the in the mural if you don't never see yourself in the mural amen you don't know how you you know what i'm saying that's what happens when when your seed and you sheep amen it's something about you you recognize yourself in the book amen because amen john can only identify himself in the book amen he had a true identification because amen he saw his life being manifest and what he was manifesting he saw it in the book then he could say i'm i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness so he knew his and you cannot say that until it's revealed to you until you can see yourself in the book other than that you're taking other people's word you you have confidence in the preacher and you believe in the preacher you have confidence and that's why so many fall away from the faith amen so many fall away from the the truth and from god because they never really they took their parents amen i was born this way i was raised this way and they never saw themselves in the book so the word amen got to talk to you until the word starts talking to you amen and and when the word talk to you amen and you hear the voice of the word it's coming off the pages now it's getting amen it's got a voice and it starts speaking to you amen and if you don't never hear the word speak that's why people don't read the bible because the word don't talk back don't have a conversation but people that read their bible they know the word will speak to you it'll talk to you it's alive it's not dead to others it's just that letter but to others it's alive that's why it speaks back it does something to you when you read your bible you begin to oh something comes off the pages it's not just something it's just about another book like you read and and you get caught up in fantasizing and uh romanticizing and all of that but this bible amen it does something amen to uh wash you it purifies you it sanctifies you it cleans you up it feeds your soul amen the word of god it's got something it's got the nutrients that causes your spiritual man amen to be faith praise god that's why my soul get happy amen it's sweeter than honey in the honeycomb because it it shows me that's me yes lord this is what you've done for me amen oh i'm glad to know amen that i'm in the book praise god i'm not it's not a dead letter that's why you leave your bible at the church because it don't mean much to you they can gather dust it don't it don't speak back until this word becomes more than your necessary food it speaks back praise god you know you know sometimes you get so much word in you you're going through the word and you only never pick up the bible don't have to pick it up sometimes you're just feasting on the word why because the word is so much a part of you you know you meditate on it day and night you begin to quote you begin to quote the bible and the bible began to speak back to you why because it's off the page it's nice it's inside you oh you're with me and when the word get inside you when you're about to go against the words they meant that word to come back are you with me because it's with you that word have i see until it get in your heart you'll keep on sinning against it but god word have i hid in my heart that i are you with me amen when the word is in the inside you don't have to worry about it because the word is a buckle and a shield are you with me oh it's my sword and my shield oh i i thank god amen that the word of god will do what it's saying that is like fire shut up in my bones the word of god amen praise god it's good better than honey in the honeycomb amen praise god it's a lamp into my feet praise god light to my path amen what about it the brother sister is it that good to you don't let nothing replace the word don't let nobody replace the word amen praise god don't get caught up with with all kind of devices and you don't and you leave off the word amen praise god amen god is a jealous god and he said i won't have no other god before me are you with me stay with the book ain't that the bible amen it's the word of god don't let nobody fool you now so i believe people lost focus on what the message is all about it's about the bible are you with me so he says here i'll read the 11th verse in whom also we have attained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him the work of all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ this is what the verse that i choose my subject from and whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after ye what not when you believe as the prophet the baptist said we receive the holy ghost when we believe are you with me they said we when we believe we got the holy ghost we're born again we got the holy ghost the bible says here he said whom ye also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom after ye believed you were what you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise amen that's why paul in the 19th chapter of acts let's just look there for a moment see because some folks say they they receive the holy ghost when they believe they got the holy ghost are you with me and um potentially you know what i'm saying but by the grace of god it says and it came to pass acts 19 and it came to pass uh while polos was was at congress paul having passed through the upper coast came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received what the holy ghost what since you believed they were believers but they didn't have the holy ghost are you with me so it's many believers that have accepted christ and they're believers have you he didn't say you didn't believe he said since you bleed see some folks are taking said you know if you're not with us you're not a believer you're not even a saved you know you you're nothing but he said have you received the holy ghost since you believe i'm not going to take away believing because the prophet god said he said i see that light over you sister you're a christian you didn't say your baptism your methods you this he said you're a christian the light said that are you with me but some folk are so quick to say you ain't nothing they got more nerves but the angel god and that light said you're christian you said i see that light are you with me just like he can look and see cancer in people and see the tuberculosis and all of that he looked and he said i see that light are you with me i think sometimes we're so quick to condemn are you with me so we got a lot of nerves man i don't know people just so be so excited about what they got to if other folks ain't got it you know let's stop them jesus said leave them alone they talking about me and my name then they ain't against a day for us are you look man you know at harvest time he said i'll do the work not you but i'll do it sit for my angels and they'll do it i believe the word is during the separation now i believe god is sent forth his angels and the word is separating right now but you got to have a revelation not as men suppose now see we we suppose that we're going to get up and we're gonna do this and we're gonna do that and we start separating ourselves no no we don't have to separate ourselves the word or do the separation are you what man praise god what fellowship has amen light with what oh goodness you don't have to worry about it the darkness when the light comes the darling's got to separate itself are you with me the light ain't got the fight against the dog there's all the light got to do is what just shine are you a man praise god that's all you got to whoa darkness get out my way oh no light ain't got no struggle not no fight and god praise god he said this is condemnation because light has come amen praise god and men love what rather than light because what the deeds are evil don't worry about it they'll be manifested praise god amen so the deeds are manifesting themselves are you with me their very action what they do how they live is manifesting itself are you with me so brother and sister don't you try oh you know i i i might get into sunday morning right now you know sometimes we'll be trying to pull a mole out of somebody else i and then i'm asking the question what's in your eye you you know you see all the problems with somebody else but what's in your eye the bible said we see a mole in somebody else's eye and then we got a what we got a beam in ours brothers and sisters if you see your brother or sister overtaking what a fault you which is spiritual what pray for amen if you're going to be spiritual but if you're going to have a beam in yours i can see amen praise god that bean what's in your eye praise god you might have a little mold but some folk got beans because they sure want to magnify your mold are you with me every every thought you got never look they ain't you god working on in your life they want to point out all that in this too but brother and sister don't worry about the thing everything will work out to you good are you with me everything will work out to you good go on live your life praise god don't let nothing hinder you amen go on be loving be kind be tenderhearted amen the walk out and i love my ain't letting nobody mess with me ain't nobody gonna mess up oh lord pole thing paul thing they messed up with jesus christ every one of the apostles got killed except for john they said he died a natural bear paul had his head cut off and nero chopped and blocked peter was crucified they said upside down and every apostle you know they they suffered they went through something somebody looked at us wrong [Music] who you think you looking at you know brothers and sisters we got to grow up we got to get out of here this world is full of darkness this world is gross darkness should cover the earth and darkness the people this thing is getting wicked out here and we ain't got time for that are you with me you and i don't have time for no craziness amen we on our way to heaven enjoying our trip brother and sister that's what it's all about it's going to heaven time amen we got to amen girder up the lungs of our mind because it's going home time brother sister praise god that perfect love if we want to get over there nothing but perfect love can get there amen praise god we've got to come amen to grips with ourselves and know what god is requiring in this day that we're living in praise god and i said god help me mercy on me praise god amen i'm not always i'm not there yet amen but god is working on me praise god i got shortcomings and i got things that god's still working on me and somebody said i'm a work in progress amen god's still working on me praise god so the prophet said if you're looking for fault you're what amen why because all of us what bone in sin shaving and nicotine the one perfect one that was the christ jesus amen and what is christ the only way you become perfect you're perfect in christ amen and through the blood he looked at you through the blood that's what where your perfection come from other than that the folks look long enough they gonna see something are you with me god is good you love him tonight oh are we journeying on amen he said have you received the holy ghost and i'm talking about the seal of god in the mark of the beast the seal of god the mark of the beast have you received the holy ghost sent you bleed are you with me see you can believe and still don't have the holy ghost so leave them alone they believe they don't have the holy ghost okay are you with me don't you can't make them do what they can't do until they get the power to do it with amen but they got to surrender themselves to sanctification where the holy ghost can come and fill them up praise god and some folks been going a long time just in their head they got it but in their heart they fall for me amen we got a lot of intellectual holy ghost-filled people amen they know how to quote it they know how to talk it but they they don't know how to they can't express the love of god they can't express the love of god let me let me show you something brother and sister let me go back here or back over to ephesian one and uh finish without the finish we're talking about the the seal of god in the mark of the beast amen you know i was the other day i was just meditating upon the lord and the lord just i believe it's the spirit of god that spoke to me i just believed that maybe it's just me thinking out loud and he said and it was saying people already received the mark of the beast and brothers and sisters when you're surprised the folk might be i hope nobody's sitting in here received it already you know what i'm saying i hope nobody's certainly he'll receive it already you know but when you determine that you're going to serve the devil now who the devil who is the devil let's just look hold your hand there who's the devil if you determine that you're gonna serve the devil now and nobody can't stop you from serving the devil nothing the preacher's saying nothing the church said not mama daddy nobody can stop you from serving the devil and you know most of those people are so big and bad and they say they ain't gonna receive the mark of the beast most of those people that's so big and bad serving the devil right now they're big and bad and they say they ain't gonna receive the marketing beast you ask them yo man then when the mark of the beast comes you're gonna get it man no man i'll die first you're already dead how you gonna die dead and truck pass in your sin are you with me don't even know dead and what don't know it a lot of folk dead and don't know the dead praise god they they're not living they're dead the bible said we have been quickened from the dead isn't that right so god has made us alive we're living but they dead and they don't even know they're dead amen the day adam and eve sinned the day they died they flushed you know and they might have kept on walking but uh after a while man you know your hair get gray your feet get shot and then after a while you just going on off the scene in there a man that's born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble amen so that's why a man has to be born again are you with me because this this life here amen what's working in you is death working in this body but amen but it's a it's a power that has come down his seed and got down in the holy ghost is the life of god amen that's on the inside praise god when you were born again when you received the bible the baptism of the holy ghost and the seal of god amen there's something down inside you amen keeping me alive amen he's keeping me alive the holy ghost and the power keeping me alive they meant something on the inside keeping me alive praise god i was dead one time amen but thank god i'm living now praise god i i i done god one time again oh hallelujah can't die no more amen whosoever liveth and believing in me shall what never die praise god i'm a believer how about

i'm gonna tell you something folks see things oh i saw that did you see this did you see that did you hear this and hear that that ain't the major problems you know what your major problem is i'm gonna tell you something you ever seen amen uh the heart it's kind of hidden cover over in it okay you ever seen the kidneys and the liver and all of that and i'm gonna tell you something it can be things going on in your body on the inside that when they take the blood work they say you got this you got that you said hey i didn't know i had this but your you know things be walking on folk and folk being so busy looking at the outside oh i look good and everything lies i feel good but they mean they begin to take the blood work and then they begin to take x-rays they say hey did you know you had this do you know you have and you know sometimes in the spirit realm amen it takes the word of god to find out things that's going on inside you the spiritual doctor the fivefold ministry go down and amen lord hallelujah did you know you had this he said oh i just discovered it it meant when the doctor exposed it dr jesus exposed it through the word that was determining the thought in the tense of my heart but dr jesus was able to diagnose my case and i find out what was keeping my joy away my peace away amen i found out praise god i didn't know today dr jesus came i believe that the doctors in the house thank you jesus that he can diagnose your case and and find out what's your problem amen why you don't have what you're supposed to have as a believer why you're not walking in victory and why you don't have the joy and the peace of god like you ought to have as a christian i believe dr jesus is here i believe he's saying to you they meant why aren't you praising me amen if you love me why don't you worship me praise god why don't you praise me amen if i be lifted up if i be lifted up i'll draw all men [Applause] now i tell you we ought to lift him up amen so some of the things that folk be looking at and talking about is it brother simon did that disturb no not a time why because i'm interested in what's going on in the inside i'm trying to get the insider i'm

pray god amen i want you to penetrate that heart god i want you to go amen oh hallelujah praise god i'm not going to deal with your outside i'm going to pray god you deal with the inside praise god hallelujah when god dealt with my heart and dealt with me on the inside the outside came on it was all right are you with me praise god you can get god right in the inside you don't have to worry about the outside but if you focus on the outside you'll never know what the problem is what's causing they meant the effect on the outside what's causing your head to get swell up praise god you may have a tumor a spiritual tumor in the head praise god something wrong in the brain the spiritual oh these things be happening and folk don't know what's going on things are happening on the inside that's why you've got to pray and ever see in the spirit of god that can diagnose and can discern and can help praise god the purpose of the church is to bring healing for the soul ain't meant to clean the spirit of praise god the help the word that's what the word is doing the word is amen is dealing with things and people are being delivered and not understanding sometimes not understanding amen how the spirit move you see some it's something about the young lady went to went back past the little nightclub and heard the music and she went back to the into the nightclub i mean to a little jew john uh to look excuse me y'all young people don't know what went back to the little ballroom the next thing you know she was dancing on the floor and she came she came to god serving and she locked and let her in and and she was so repentant and so sorry because the music got to and she was dancing again on on on on the floor and then she was so condemned in a spirit when we got that the prophet prayed for something like a bat flew out of her amen and sometimes sometimes you know that's what i'm saying a folktale it's a spiritual thing if folks get backstage inside them then you trying to oh you was on that dance floor we saw you over there but they didn't know a bat got in her amen but you know so you got to pray to get that bat out see we're dealing with the weapons of our warfare not carnal but that mighty regard to the pulling down the strongholds through the casting out of imagination we're dealing we're in a spiritual warfare this thing ain't no outside show you can't go by what you see with your eyes and what's your oh lord i saw yeah you saw but praise god pray a god said brother can i help you sister can i help you what's going on amen not condemn but hell people can feel whether or not you want to help them or you want to condemn them amen this woman were caught in the very act the very act we called her now what you gonna do about it yeah it's a woman you know where you're accused is i have none he said amen it's a going sin no more amen are you with me can you have enough compassion to tell folk to go and sin no more see that's the kind of spirit and attitude we ought to have one towards another are you that's a sweet spirit just a loving spirit and not so quick to kill somebody with your tongue or with your action let's not be so quick at the draw amen but rather cover them with the blood of jesus now i got to go did i ever read that 9th verse i mean 12 rebel i never read it okay 9 12 and 9. it said and that great dragon excuse me was cast out that old serpent called a what and satan that deceived what and he ain't gonna deceive me oh come on somebody folk already deceive and tell me the devil ain't gonna deceive them and you know they you know they they just you know there's a resistance of the word there's a resistance of the word when people resist the word amen that's the spirit if you go against the word you against you have the spirit of the antichrist you're against the word now it doesn't seems good to you good to your soul does it seem good and right if it don't seem good and right now you know sometimes y'all have to help me and pray for me if i'm all pray for me amen praise god but if i'm telling you the truth amen didn't believe the truth but if i'm all pray for me just like i can i can make mistakes and say something i shouldn't have said or i can you know whatever but the thing is you can come to me and say brother simmons why did you say that you know what i'm saying because if i said something intentionally to hurt you or to talk about you or talk down to you but if i say something to help you and you received it the other way when i meant it for good amen praise god but see what happens amen the devil will take the word by the time it gets to your ear and he'll take it and twist it it's supposed to be for your good but when the devil gets you all twisted up in your head you say pastor don't care nothing about me see what i'm saying pastor don't love me pastor got his picks all kind of stuff that i'm gonna tell you something it ain't a buddy-buddy friendship it's the word amen we come for the word and the word alone amen thank god that we can love one another praise god and i'm gonna tell you something i think paul he had somebody he was closer to and barnabas had somebody he was closer to oh you wouldn't man so it was happening that all things weren't the good they went one right direction the other went the other direction and it came back together and the holy ghost shoes both for direction are you what man see the holy ghost can do it but you see somebody say well what folks want i'm gonna say that old devil john martin we want to go back and see about his family and we're out here on the missionary trip and he's going back oh lord man don't come back with all the morning back with me but they didn't fall out barnum said come on go with me are you with me so it's something about god god will work on things if you keep the right spirit regardless of amen how we different if we keep the right spirit god will walk it all to our good but if one of us get a bad attitude or bad spirit then it'll it it can do a lot of damage you don't never get placed to the devil don't never let the enemy come in [Music] and accuse the brothers amen said you know the prophet said they didn't mean it and you got to always keep that attitude they didn't mean to hurt me they didn't mean to say that they didn't mean that isn't that right and when you keep that kind of love and that kind of forgiveness things will work out what a beautiful home you could have what a beautiful marriage you could have what a beautiful family you can have what a beautiful job you can go in and worry are you with me i'm gonna tell you something everything can turn around on you it's just the way you amen the way you handle it situations the way you think about situations don't let bad thoughts arise amen just be sweet just be loving and be kind and god will work it out praise god i tell you don't do you no good it won't help you knowing to get oh tell you listen man you're talking to somebody you'll be sick your pressures go up all kinds of things start happening praise god but if you'll be sweet and nice god will bless you okay back to ephesian one i'm finna come to close caleb thank you for coming up you help me out i won't be two hours praise god maybe i go back to my hour and a half like i used to praise god but god is good okay we're in ephesians one so this is what i want you to uh see here uh oh boy i can't get to it i was talking about the seal of god in the market of beast but um the seal has to do with uh uh finished work uh uh finished transit action that's the first thing the one the second thing is ownership third thing is security now i ain't got time to go through the scriptures to show you all those different things but by the grace of god but i want you to know oh boy it's one scripture that i really want and i don't know how to get there i know i i go to ephesians 4. and 30 ephesians 4 and 30. but by the grace of god maybe i i got to continue on sunday morning perhaps i don't know the seal of god in the mark of the beast now i know it's it's a serious debt but i got off on all those other things but god knows what we need amen and don't y'all ever feel like when the preacher is preaching he's preaching to y'all the preacher when the holy spirit take control he has to know that he it goes for him too y'all understand what i'm saying because sometimes y'all think hey the preacher said this like the preacher's perfect are you with me that preacher saying those things but what he's saying it come back it's a child to a sword are you with me so it goes for him too so it goes for me too you know sometimes god might put you on the conviction but hey i get under conviction too god i got to do better myself god help me lord you know because what did you say to me you said it to me too amen they ain't talking to you see sometimes y'all think the minister is talking to y'all but he talking to himself too when the spirit of god comes forth it don't leave nobody out god has no what respect the person praise god are you with me so it says here in ephesians 4 and 30 and grieve not the one whereby you or what see isn't it beautiful seal having to do with the finished work it's it talks about the ownership and security the seal of god amen and i wish i had time to go to ezekiel 9 but you know where he said put a mark upon them and i that sighed and cried because of the abomination done in the city amen and revelation 13 talk about put a mark and just see with all the dwell on the earth he said put a mark in the forehead and in the hand are you with me they received the mark of the beast i tell you things are going on people are readily they're saying give me them all amen because they're already doing the will of the antichrist they're saying to the devil i'll sell out you can have my life you can have my life if you don't want god to have your life what are you saying you're saying to the devil have my life you can have it you know the devil said okay if you come and follow me i'll give you this and i'll give you that he tried it with jesus he's trying to give jesus this and that and all of this will i give you all you got to do is what all jesus had to do with what 409 and what worship him isn't that right what the devil is offering you what all kind of stuff he's saying watching me and you know something if you ignore this word today you're not ignoring brother simmons because brother simmons will be gone tomorrow amen i mean brother friend this word will be here standing us in the face and and if we don't want this word i'm going to tell you something you're talking about the mark of the beast i'mma talk when the devil get through with you you wish you would have listened to the word and obeyed the word a lot of folk i'ma tell you even if you oh god and that's why we we warn men and we try to guide people to the love of god and tell them don't brother and sister don't don't let the devil fool you the devil ain't your friend the devil will kill you the devil will destroy you don't listen to them but you know why they're ill or dog the heart has become hard the director said daddy you don't know what the condition of the world is today with the young people you don't know the young people and what they are facing so this almost is an ungodly world the future of this world if it's looking for the young people it's going to be hard to find one over here and one over there the young people are selling like look at the young brothers they're selling out and where the young sisters gonna marry if they hold out are you whooping if you hold on but don't you know if you love god god's gonna take care of you if you love him with all your heart god don't see about you i believe god is faithful god's got to be your absolute he's got to be your ultimate we're in a terrible time brother sister it's wicked it's wicked but let me tell you something as you that with the seal of god this is what he's saying to the seal of god children this is what he's saying ephesians 4 and 30. he said and grieve not the what he said if it was possible he deceived the very elect if it was possible he said whereby you're sealed until what now this is this is what i like here because you can rejoice because you seal but he's saying to you that a sealed he said let all what the 31st verse let all what let all what that's what i'm saying see he said that all bitterness and what wrath and what anger and what clamor and what evil speaking be what put away from among you with all what malice and what this is what i like this is what i like and be what i ain't speaking to her because she got a bad spirit watching the mole in the beams she's a hypocrite he's a hypocrite come on just be kind see because god wants that his attributes to flow out from you just be kind regardless of what condition another individual is in he's saying to you be you uh be you what look what she did she did this he did that look at what nobody's saying i know what i know i know what i know i know what i've seen i know what i heard i know what they've done 10 years ago 20 years ago oh lord oh god have mercy let it go please let it go but he hurt me so bad let it go well i know i know let it go i ain't gonna let it go okay hold on to it i can't help you all the preaching in the world can't help you praise god jesus christ himself came down he can't help you why because you won't let it go we want to hold on to the pain and the hurt and the disappointment don't hold on to it let it go you know how long do it too long already let it go it's a god oh let me let me show you what he says at an end he said be kind what not to some people amen one two one that's that's you just be kind to everybody okay he says and what tend to hearted i find sometimes we're too we're too rough sometimes we can be a little too rough to be christians sometimes we can say things that the holy spirit would grieve the very holy spirit sometimes we can think things that would cause the holy spirit to be grieved he said grieve not the holy spirit so it must be that you can have the holy spirit and you can cause the holy spirit to be what grieve so he said grieve not the holy spirit if you want god to stay with you you can you this is the way you keep god the holy spirit you keep the seal praise god and know that you're sealed this is the way you can maintain this is your security this is your home he said be kind uh one one towards another tender hearted and what for what i already forgave him i told him i was sorry i forgave him yeah i believe that your actions showing that you didn't forgive them because every time you look around you got to bring up that same situation and when you bring it up your pain returned you know what brother branham said he said your faith causes sickness to go and your unbelief will cause you to work isn't that right and so what happens amen yo what you speak you forgave for a moment then you spoke it right back you took your forgiveness right by you forgave and you said and it was real peaceful and real nice and then next thing you know yeah yeah but when you overtalk yourself and you're over everything just come right back on you same situation and you never get victory you never get the victory in your life because why you keep on bringing that same thing up over and over and over and over and again you need to let it go until you let it go amen it's gonna keep on that hurt the pain the sorrow everything that you went through you're going to keep on going through it over and over and over in your mind the other person could be going on about the business ain't thinking about it no more but you holding on to it the person that caused all the hurt and all the pain going on and you up there still taking it around are you with me brother and sister i said let it let it go okay let it go and half of the time ain't nothing something the devil got there anyway you have that what the cause what division to divide and conquer amen he says forgiving one another even as god for what has what well you remember when that's why folk dead and gone you still ain't forgiven now i know the dead folk ain't did nothing yeah they did something to me when they're living they still living to you why cause you still bringing up that same stuff they might as well be living because you're hurting your pain you're still living off of that and that's causing a root of bitterness in you and that thing is working until you let that go you still gonna have a lot of bitterness and it's going to come out and you'll you cannot walk in perfect love because you're living in the past amen and everything that happened to you in the past it began to work because you see it coming again at you and you're trying to protect yourself from being hurt again as long as you're trying to protect yourself from being hurt oh lord have mercy praise god even when folks try to help you you think they're trying to hurt you are you with me we begin to get a little when anything look like it's coming your way sometimes we can't even receive love because we think something is behind it are you with me let's just love one another love god with all your heart with everything you've got are you a man once you love god right it'll begin little seven rainbow colors will begin to come forth out of you are you with me because you have the covenant of god and the blood apply are you with me then you'll find faith virtue knowledge temperance again everything began to flow from the fountain of love the holy ghost amen god bless you let us there hallelujah we're moving somewhere we're

thinking about that something when how he was saying that you know the lord is still working on us and none of us perfect it reminded me something uh i think deacon walker was saying the other week he was talking about a song he said that it took the lord only a week to make the earth the sun the moon and the stars but after all these years he's still working on me and i believe that with all of my heart amen you know i really thank god tonight for his grace and his mercy appreciate the word like i said don't let it slip but those nuggets that we heard and those things ponder on them go home and ponder on them in your heart i believe it's some releasing and some freedom that we can get from some things that got us bound if we can only learn how as he was saying to let go amen let go and let god how many believe that tonight i really thank god as he was saying you know uh a lot of times some people may think that the preacher is preaching at them or on them but they understand that's why that that the word ain't just for the people but the preacher is getting it too a lot of times everybody tell me say man you say come on after everything you say but i said you know why because i be preaching to myself a lot of times that you're ministering things be coming out you don't even it's just coming out and as it's coming out i'll be saying come on because i'll be preaching to myself and a lot of times what it is the word come to you first so you have to do all the repenting and and laying before god before you give it to the people because that's what the spirit said to you so you just delivering what the spirit said to you to the people and it's always a blessing how many believe that tonight so i thank the lord for his word you really appreciate the word tonight come on i said he only took a week to make the stars the sun and the moon but after 38 years and he's still working on me amen let us bow our heads tonight [Music] heavenly father lord we just thank you for
