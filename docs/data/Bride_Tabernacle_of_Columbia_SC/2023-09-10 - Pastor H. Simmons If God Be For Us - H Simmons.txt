morning pray that you heal your lord I pray that you are confident I pray that you're strengthened will you bless your people now in a special way in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Romans 8 chapter 27 verse we stand for the reading of the word God is good amen there's nobody like you Lord amen nobody like you Lord and he that searches the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because he make it intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work it together for good to them to love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom it did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren well over whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spares not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us what all things God bless the read his words you may be seated this morning I like to use it for familiar topic if God be for us if God be for us in many occasions in the Bible we can pick out several characters in The Bible but we just want to do a few and hope that your situation would relate to some of these that characters because the Bible says there's no temptation taking us but such is common to man but God will with the Temptation make a way of Escape so I'm saying to you sometimes we have to identify that will not the only ones that have gone through problems and situations the Bible tells us there's nothing new on the Sun so we can be encouraged by amen these ones that had their trials and their tribulations they had to go through things but one thing about it they knew that God was with them one thing we must be confident in that doesn't matter or what we go through we understand that he said I'll never will leave you and I never will forsake you amen you're not in it alone you're not in it by yourself you're not alone because sometimes it seem as though we're in it by ourselves and we feel like a man that amen where is God at my trying times and when trouble is all around where is God if he said I'll never leave your God is still there amen sometimes we go through things and amen we we think that God has forsaken us but God hasn't forsaken us amen he's still with us no matter what we go through God is still there praise God one thing another I know that he's my Lord and he's my God he's my savior and I'm not going to doubt him so uh I I thought uh two characters this morning as I was praying and I thought about the story of Esther Esther had I said she was God's secret weapon yes there was a secret amen that was hid someone in the enemy camp sometimes amen God to place you in places you don't know how you got there and why you are there Mordecai Esther uncles told her amen when the King was looking for somebody to replace amen uh VyStar the queen and he was looking for somebody and he was looking throughout the kingdom trying to find amen a a queen knowing that Esther was a Jew amen Mordecai told her to say Amen another name because not knowing what was up ahead and the King chose asked him to be his Queen you know somewhat will in captivity and Australian land sometimes being in the strange in a land a man of captivity and a Strange Land and you find yourself there victims of circumstances that beyond your control we understand that the Bible said be not uneekly yoked together with unbelievers but yet this Jewish young girl find herself in a situation in a great dilemma somehow we would say the instructions of our uncle amen wasn't good instructions to tell her amen to be a man of favor and become a amen Queen [Music] sometimes we don't know how God is maneuvering and how God is moving so sometimes we try to exchange before the time we already have made our opinion sometimes we judge people's lives amen by what we see exterior not knowing that God has an interior motive God won't achieve something that amen beyond your comprehension in your spirituality you might be so spiritual and so amen good with the letter of the word not knowing amen that God has a plan amen that beyond your comprehension sometimes we don't know amen while we move in certain directions we don't understand ourselves why we move like that God has a plan amen God knows them that are his and God knows how to deliver The Godly out of Temptation the Bible tells this is not him that will it nor him that run it but God that shows the mercy amen praise God God is in control when you think that amen all things are out of control God's still in control when you think that your life is a mess and you think that our hope is lost God is still in control he's still in control amen hallelujah God knows when to stop ends praise God and God knows when the time comes amen that you would recognize your purpose God knows when that time comes that you'll come to your season and your reason for living for God has a season a time that he has appointed our steps and nominal bounds we cannot pass your season your time and your reason for living you may not be walking in your season and in your purpose you might not understand the fullness of why you're here and what God expectation is of you you may not understand how God will use you and how God Amen looks on you even when you're in a place that's seem to be safe you're in an uncomfortable place you may not say that this is a an orthodox please shy I don't understand my purpose I I don't understand but I'm going through the motion I've tried to deal with life I'm trying to make the best of it because I hadn't fully come into amen my purpose my destiny has not been revealed to me as of yet amen how God will amen white things to my good Ness how God will even calls him that his glory to shine and his purpose to be made manifested I don't understand how it's going to happen but somehow amen little old me insufficient little old girl like Esther young lady out of all the Young virgins in the kingdom God chose her the king chose Esther but her uncle which was the Jew Mordecai it was one that understood who he was understood who is God understood that he was a Jew you must understand who you are praise God understand who your father is Hallelujah I understand that I have a question I understand my father is God the true and the Living God so he understood that mordecaiyan when Haman one of the closest advises to the king he wanted all the people to recognize his authority and who he was you know how it is folks get a little position then they get Amen to a little pride and they wanted everybody to look up to him and give him uh uh you know honor him respect him bow down to him the devil would have you to bow down to his demon forces the devil wants you to bow down unto the Demons of of immorality the Demons of homogene and in line and stealing and cheating the devil would have you to bow down to drugs and alcohol and oh all kind of devices of the enemy he would have you to bow down and if you don't bow down he's upset with you yeah yeah but we'll have the young ladies to strip off their clothes and reveal the secret parts of their body the devil will have the young men it meant to be act like amen animals and dogs as brother Nathan said the other night running from one place to another just so Amen to the dog she called you're not called to be a dog they've been running like you don't know who you are the Son of God as the daughter of God you have a standard to keep amen God chose you to be holy amen God chose you to live holy God chose you to walk holy amen I know we're living in a world of chaos and confusion and praise God and I know the powers of the enemy has amen confronted you well how are you going to resist the devil Mordecai made in his mind I don't care how many demons or devils I'm not bowing down to Haman are you with me examine your life examine your situation and you might understand that you also are confronted with your Haman your Haman may not be a matter of physical and division it might be an individual that is physical that is coming against you in your life and your family your hand on your facing I don't know what you were facing but God knows that you haven't Haman that you must face and you must stand bold and confidence knowing that if God be for us are you a man of God before Hallelujah I'm not worried about him amen because it's God it's for us amen oh so the challenge was when he could not [Music] amen he was devised in the scheme whereby he might destroy not only Mordecai but all the folks that amen are that were like Mordecai all the Jews I want them all dead the devil just don't want you dead he wants your children he wants your family he wants everything that pertaining to you are you up there when you choose to stand against him he wants to destroy everything are you up man so the devil is not just upset with you he's upset with your children that's why mothers and the fathers have to stand in the gap for their children because job had to stand in the gap for his are you with me Jesus stood in the gap for you and I and he prayed he'd expand not his own son but delivered him up for us are you with me Hallelujah I'm telling you this morning if God be forth Hallelujah praise God it looks like amen Hammond look like he's uh gotten the victory isn't that right but Haman don't have the victory this morning look like a Haman is winning let us go to Esther for a moment Esther job and so forth let me just try to go through my Bible verse in the Bible oh Esther uh are you with me Esther for after four and 15. you you're caught in the limbo Hamer doesn't advisor scheme he's got the king all inside and he manipulated the King and King uh no don't know all together you know sometimes people are manipulating to destroy you and using people close to you sometimes the devil will use your own children against you sometimes the devil will use your own family member against you the devise a scheme in that sometimes he used Mama against your daddy against you sometimes they use somebody real close to you to divide the scheme to destroy you are you with me the king event and Haven to know that God had a secret with him so he's advising a scheme to destroy all the Jews I'ma tell you look at somebody tell them that they ever hate you you got to know that he don't love you I got my friend your friends ain't nothing I I I ain't giving up my friend you better give up those devils but if they ever pull a mess off come on they have a pulling myself oh goodness you'll see some hideous inside of those people amen they can't get free because that's what they are you can't get free from what you are amen but if you are not of that amen then you can be free but here the the devil scheme in behind the scene and uh the king don't know the fullness of what Haman is doing are y'all with me and sometimes you may not know how the enemy is going to use you against people amen that's walking upright the enemy uh uh I'll call you the fight against the very one that you love are you with me and all of a sudden you becoming a victim because the enemy has devised the skin that anything do what he was doing hey but nobody was doing he knew amen that the king had no idea of his demise what is trickery his scheming are you with me so about the grace of God I want you to be well conscious that it meant your friends that you keep and those that you call friends your family members or whoever they might be amen when they come against the king when they come against the king amen come against them all the car come against the least ones are you up there come against the little ones in the Kingdom amen because they're holding the standard and they're holding to God's unchanged at hand and because they're trusted in God and they won't bow down to sin are you with me because they not don't drink they're not gonna smoke they're not gonna dope praise God little young ladies did not know they're not going to take off their clothes and walk around naked they're not trying to show what they got are you with me they gonna amen they're going to be Godly young girls they ain't doing all this crazy stuff because they know amen a Bob was a prize I'm not my own oh I got a card that I love I got a God that I serve oh

tell you something amen of all the school houses against you if all the teachers against you that the whole world is against you but if God beware if God be for you Hallelujah sometimes we're afraid we'll stay Mordecai wasn't scared that's true at a time she might have questioned amen she made a question because she was in a safe place she was the queen if all the Jews get 10 I am the queen look all you said Esther he sent a message to him today I'm gonna let you know that you ain't gonna Escape are you up man and if you don't stand up now come on somebody and if you don't stand up now God

this reason all the underlying things that didn't I didn't understand has come to his head now even down to Serious Business right now Amen in the world in this state over there with a couple thousand people got killed in the earthquake and over here and over there all kind of things are happening in the world it's showing you that this world is falling apart are you up man but in the season of the wild falling apart brother and sister they might be they met soon and very soon the persecution of the Bride will come forth if you get ready amen because of you taking a stand for Holiness and righteousness and it stands for God Amen if you take that stand now I told brother Nathan I said it'll be too late for folks to wake up when it started to happen amen when they start coming in at the bride and amen telling the bride you can't preach what you preach you can't teach what you teach you can't stand and be a Christian in this hour you've got to compromise some folks don't mind compromising and Mordecai and said Esther why you making up your mind to say time for you to compromise are you up there so he has to realize that I'm in a spot I'm at a fight spot what I'm gonna do about my situation I got to do something shall I just go to stay a hidden secret [Music] I said I come on out the closet are you with me should I come out the closet and let them know my true identity are you praise God it's time for you to come on out and show your true identity amen I'm not in it I'm not who you think I am but I'm a child oh I'm a child of the king I am a Jew Hallelujah sometimes time for you to understand that I am a Christian Hallelujah it's time that I take a stand as a Christian praise God hallelujah so this is Esther summation Mordecai then put on the spot and he says in
