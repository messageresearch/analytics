[34:17] or judah and yet inhabitants of
[34:21] jerusalem
[34:23] and thy king jehoshaphat
[34:26] thus said the lord
[34:30] unto you be not
[34:34] afraid nor dismissed
[34:38] by reason of this great multitude
[34:43] for the battle is not
[34:46] yours but god
[34:49] may god bless you reading of his word in
[34:51] jesus name
[34:54] you know
[34:57] said the president of the united states
[34:59] have corona
[35:00] we need to be praying god touch him amen
[35:04] the bible said pray for them that are in
[35:06] authority
[35:08] so folks are getting their political
[35:10] swain and they say well
[35:13] you know but christians
[35:16] understand in the gap amen pray for them
[35:20] that are in authority
[35:21] and be obedient to the word amen
[35:25] so we thank god for
[35:28] praise god allow us to be
[35:32] in a country where we can worship god
[35:35] amen
[35:36] well we can stand and say thank you

[35:40] regardless of the political situation
[35:44] we still say thank you jesus
[35:47] because god is good and we appreciate
[35:51] him amen
[35:54] so by the grace of god today
[35:59] the battle is not yours but
[36:02] the lord are you with me
[36:07] he said the battle is not yours but it's
[36:10] god
[36:13] amen if you sit down by a family member
[36:15] you can just look at your family member
[36:17] and tell them the battle is not yours
[36:22] but god amen
[36:27] the battle is not yours but god
[36:32] but the lord isn't that right so
[36:36] i'm sure if you're living
[36:39] then you are challenged with
[36:42] obstacles and things that you know
[36:46] that are coming against you
[36:51] paul says in the romans that there's the
[36:53] war going on
[36:56] when i desire to do good evil is present
[36:59] with me
[37:01] so if you're not battered then you're
[37:03] not conscious that there
[37:05] is a war going on every christians
[37:09] are are in contact constantly
[37:13] there's a battle between good and evil
[37:16] there's a battle between right and wrong
[37:22] amen we have to fight
[37:25] amen because when we decide to do good
[37:27] evil is present
[37:31] all you got to do is just be born and
[37:34] just live and there's a wall going on
[37:38] but i'm saying to you that are saved
[37:41] this morning
[37:43] you that
[37:44] [Music]
[37:46] know the lord the battle
[37:50] is not yours but the lord
[37:55] are you with me now as we
[38:00] go further in this try to understand
[38:03] this
[38:04] message here
[38:08] uh we understand this judah was
[38:11] contending with
[38:16] the children of amen and moab and
[38:20] monsieur they had invade
[38:25] israel so it was an invasion
[38:31] you and i they look at
[38:34] the physical realm of the children of
[38:37] god being invaded by
[38:41] the enemy of other nations that have
[38:44] come up to destroy them
[38:49] you and i amen must look at the
[38:51] spiritual realm
[38:54] and the battle that wages war
[38:57] that goes on in our mind as
[39:00] the god servant said the greatest battle

[40:17] in the 16th verse brother gordon you
[40:19] want to read for us
[40:20] he says
[40:25] second chronicles
[40:31] tomorrow go ye down against them
[40:35] and behold they come up by the cliff of
[40:38] zizen
[40:39] and you shall find them at the end of

[40:50] battle set yourselves stand ye still
[40:55] and see the salvation of the lord
[40:58] with you o judah and jerusalem
[41:02] he says stand ye still
[41:06] you know sometimes we can't stand still
[41:09] long enough
[41:10] to see god fight out of that
[41:13] go ahead amen but he said stan
[41:16] ye still sometimes we panic when we're
[41:20] confronted
[41:21] with the enemy and it is
[41:24] difficult because sometimes folks get in
[41:27] the
[41:28] uh get nervous and get afraid and get
[41:31] this maze
[41:34] are you looking amen but he said stan
[41:37] ye still i heard the song
[41:41] said be still and know that i
[41:44] am god amen are you with me
[41:48] praise god i want you to be still this
[41:51] morning
[41:52] and i want you to know that i am
[41:56] god
[42:00] amen i
[42:02] am the lord that healeth all thy
[42:05] diseases
[42:08] be still and know
[42:12] that i'm god stand ye
[42:16] still praise god
[42:21] hallelujah i notice here
[42:24] uh lately there are enemies within and
[42:27] enemies without
[42:29] that folks that in the church that's
[42:31] amen same
[42:33] amen you are there any man they think
[42:35] that uh
[42:36] we're one another enemies
[42:40] they're folks that's uh outside that see
[42:43] you as a threat
[42:47] amen they're all types of enemies folks
[42:50] that
[42:50] don't know that they're controlled by
[42:52] demon power
[42:55] praise god they get in conversations
[42:57] within themselves
[42:59] and think came in amen we're just
[43:01] talking and holding
[43:02] a cage conversation
[43:06] but they don't know the enemy is
[43:08] controlling the conversation
[43:11] for they think that it's all right to
[43:14] think evil
[43:16] and to talk against one another
[43:22] they don't they don't take under
[43:24] consideration
[43:25] instead of talking i need to be lifting
[43:28] my brother up
[43:30] i need to be lifting my sister up
[43:34] for the battle is not yours
[43:40] sometimes brother was talking to me the
[43:43] other day
[43:45] and as he talked he was offering some
[43:48] type of
[43:48] la la land
[43:52] with some kind of erroneous doctrine
[43:57] and as he was trying to explain to me
[43:59] his revelation
[44:03] i like to hear that little voice
[44:06] it was the voice of god speaking how do
[44:09] i know it
[44:10] because it was the word of god
[44:14] that that voice said and i heard that
[44:17] little voice
[44:19] you know i was praying lord i want to be
[44:22] conscious
[44:23] of when you're speaking
[44:27] when i heard that little voice i said to
[44:31] brother i said brother stop for a minute
[44:36] and i believe somewhere along the line
[44:38] in the spiritual realm
[44:41] that that brother knew
[44:45] that something had happened
[44:48] and i gave him the word the scripture
[44:53] and he tried to explain the word away
[44:57] you know when you know that god has
[44:59] spoken
[45:01] you don't worry about a thing nobody can
[45:05] explain god away from you
[45:07] because you can stand assured on the
[45:10] word
[45:12] the word of god is right
[45:15] it doesn't matter how folks try to
[45:18] explain it
[45:20] i don't have to receive it if it's not
[45:23] according to scripture
[45:26] amen you've got to receive what the
[45:28] scripture says
[45:31] and if the word of god said you need to
[45:33] obey him
[45:35] are you with me sometimes i think we're
[45:39] so out of tune with the
[45:41] the word and out of tune with the voice
[45:44] of god that
[45:45] when god speak through his word
[45:47] sometimes i wonder do we hear
[45:52] you and i are constantly being battled
[45:58] the problem i have with the modern day
[46:01] church
[46:02] is that the discernment is off
[46:07] we cannot help one another when we don't
[46:10] have
[46:10] proper discernment
[46:15] that goes from the pulpit to the back
[46:17] door
[46:19] we need to be able to discern between
[46:22] right
[46:23] and wrong
[46:27] truth and arrow
[46:32] sometimes i said i said why is our
[46:34] discernment
[46:37] why can't we see amen that
[46:40] amen folk need help
[46:44] think of you if you're having trouble
[46:46] with discernment
[46:47] you all now have trouble getting on your
[46:49] knees and praying
[46:52] pray god help
[46:56] help your brother help your sister help
[46:59] you preach your heart
[47:02] if you're praying then be quiet
[47:05] i don't want to say that word shut up
[47:08] amen but sometimes it's fitting to say
[47:11] just shut up
[47:14] amen be quiet and just shut up and pray
[47:19] stop running your mouth and god might
[47:21] show you all your faults
[47:24] that you ain't got nothing to talk about
[47:26] nobody else because you got enough
[47:28] trouble
[47:28] just trying to save yourself
[47:32] are you with me since sometimes god show
[47:35] us
[47:36] what we need ourselves
[47:39] that's why we oh yes be still and know
[47:43] that i'm god are you a man
[47:48] amen every time you try the throw
[47:51] a stone at somebody you got to be
[47:55] careful that somebody's not writing on
[47:57] the ground on you
[47:59] are you up man so it's better just to be
[48:03] quiet and pray
[48:08] i've had a lot of problems in conditions
[48:11] that i
[48:12] uh amen folks sometimes said straighten
[48:15] this
[48:16] out strain that out do this do that
[48:20] amen but i said the batter
[48:24] is not brother simmons
[48:27] the battle is not broad tabernacle
[48:30] the blood is not yours
[48:34] but it's the law
[48:37] i believe god has assured me
[48:42] that the battle is not mine but it's the
[48:45] law
[48:47] amen you can have that assurance this
[48:51] morning
[48:53] that you're battling something
[48:54] [Music]
[48:56] a situation or condition
[49:00] then i'm saying to you
[49:03] be still and know that i'm god
[49:07] and the battle is not yours but it's the
[49:10] lord
[49:15] i said if the god can't handle you can't
[49:17] either
[49:19] amen if god cannot fight
[49:24] this battle you can't either
[49:27] are you with me so sometimes in our
[49:31] fight in the world we try
[49:34] to have our own tactical uh
[49:38] uh devices and we and strategize
[49:42] to our own hurt
[49:46] we begin to work a strategy how we gonna
[49:49] fight
[49:49] the battle
[49:52] but we actually are trying to fight
[49:56] the battle of our own accord
[50:00] so we are challenging the enemy but
[50:04] amen we think that we understand
[50:07] how to defeat the devil
[50:12] oh but the battle is not yours but it's
[50:15] the law
[50:18] i gotta curb a little bit he says here
[50:22] be still amen he said be still
[50:27] and see the salvation
[50:30] of the lord with you
[50:34] are you with me i want you to see the
[50:37] salvation of the lord
[50:38] with you amen
[50:42] hallelujah he says
[50:45] old judah and jerusalem fear not
[50:50] nor be what dismays

[52:25] is brother simmons saying that amen then
[52:28] you might just go out tomorrow
[52:30] and you'll find nothing has changed
[52:34] but if you believe that it's the word of
[52:35] god speaking to you
[52:37] then you go out tomorrow
[52:41] and you see that the lord is with you
[52:46] god is with you amen

[53:29] and all judah in the inhabitants of
[53:31] jerusalem
