move back out of the way you have the preeminence now in jesus name amen god is good amen second peter two and four god is good amen we want to talk about souls in prison [Music] now reason being that we're so in prison because the bible says and adam all died we know eve was the mother of all living but adam amen after the flood you know we see an adam all died because of disobedience but the last adam which is christ in christ all were made alive are you with me so we talk about father's day we look at the first adam and the last adam are you with me souls that are in prison now it says here in ii peter 2 and 4 if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell deliver them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto the judgment and spare not the old world but save noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly i'll just read the next verse anyway and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemned them with the overflow overthrow making them an example until who those that should what afterwards after should live ungodly let's check our lives up because our destiny amen is to determine how we live our lives it'll determine our destination where we're going from here god bless you you may be seated first peter 3 souls that are in prison now the dimensions of blending there's been a blending of dimensions praise god as i said that amen the saints that goes on and be with the lord that are sleeping in christ they go into the sixth dimension which would some would call it uh paradise some would call it an altar different names for it but they when they die they don't go into the seventh dimension where god is amen it's only when they met somebody talks about abraham bosom and different things like that but we realize that there's a place that you it's a waiting place the saints that are sleeping and waiting amen the prophet of god looked and he went out of a body experience and he went into the other dimension amen and he called him you know beyond the curtains of time amen when he goes out of the body and goes into a place that he calls uh sublime and he calls it those that were there he said nothing but perfect love can enter here so if you don't have perfect love you can't go into that dimension that place amen it takes perfect love amen so if you got anything against anybody you ought to forgive them amen because the only perfect love can enter there praise god it's not something we speak of it's something that amen is manifested in our lives amen but we only can have perfect love till we have the one that is perfect amen without him amen you cannot be perfect he said be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen amen praise god so god amen wants to amen perfect us through his word amen he sent his word and it brings us into a a state of perfection because his word is the incorruptible seed and if you have the seed in you amen oh god he said he that born of god does not commit sin because his seed remaineth in him and he cannot stand because he's born of god amen because of the seed of god because of amen the the very life of god being inside of you amen you're born again not of corruptable but incorruptible seed amen praise god hallelujah thank god for passing from death to life are you with me oh god those that believe past from death to life god is good amen first peter let me read 18 first peter 3 18. god is good amen oops i got my scriptures going today but 3 18. i hope everybody got their bibles 3 18. it says for christ also has once suffered for sin the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and what preached unto the spirits what and we were saying this souls in prison now the spirits down in prison which sometimes were what 21st was sometime or what disobedient when once the long suffering of god waited in the days of noah while the awkwards are preparing weighing in few that is what eight souls were saved by water i wonder how many souls will be saved now probably god talk about one in a million brother and sister if it's just one in a million that means amen we got to amen if the righteous scarcely be saved what should a sinner and ungodly appear if you're gonna barely make it amen and god has to shorten the days for the election where are we standing brother and sister amen this is not a time just to play church or play around with the soul eternity means something what we go from here should mean something that means we ought to take the give the most earnest heed to the things that we've heard at least at any time we shall let them slip amen how shall we escape and we delect so greatly salvation the salvation that amen praise god the price has been paid for your salvation amen amen so we ought to give the most earnest heed to the things what you hear we are not amen uh kind of you know uh you know just just coming to church and just hearing the word and it it's not really resonating it's not really settling down in our spirit it's not really doing anything for us because it's not falling on the right ground rather than it's got to fall on the heart that wants god somebody just said god i need something for you god i want to live for you i want to oh god i want you jesus i want your power i want you god do something for me move in my life oh get a hold to me lord praise god you can't escape oh hallelujah you can't escape amen the word upon your house praise god all things are naked and open for the eyes of whom we have to do you can't hide from god oh somebody said if i make my bed in hell you know you'll be there amen praise god i don't care where we go amen you oh god we can't run from god gotta find you and the word will meet you again it says 21st verse the like figure were unto even baptism does also now what save us i tell you god made a way to save us he made an ark to save them but god made a way that we could be saved the bible said he that believeth and is baptized shall be what are you with me god has to provide a way for this day that you can get are you with me and if you want to be saved god has provided a way for you to be saved amen he said go and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that what shall be down now that's your decision amen praise god you make the decision whether you want to be saved or whether you want to be damned you have a choice praise god if you want to be saved amen praise god he that believes and is baptized that means he peter said on the day of pentecost amen he said they were pricked in their heart and they said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do amen i i know we've done wrong with the same lord that you crucified the same one that you crucified he's been raised up and made both lord in christ amen the god that you deny the god that you rejected the god that you nailed to the cross amen jesus is he is arisen praise god i'm talking about god rising up amen praise god and delivering them that are in prison now those that are alone stole that without hope without god in the world without an up oh god god has given you an opportunity amen to come out of amen hallelujah satan got trapped in these set uh or bars and invisible bars and invisible rims in another dimension clothing you round with demon power trap you there but god made a way that you can come out of the trap out of the prison house amen here he he come to set the captain free whoa those that are bound god come the loosed hey i don't care what the devil bound you up with like it may be drug out by alcohol or adultery fornication or whatever amen that's got you bound there's a god here that's present here they meant to deliver you let's set the captain free they may praise god souls that are in prison but you can come out of it now amen god made a a provided way for this day are you with me it's by the blood of the lamb praise god i said the lamb has been slain praise god he was slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but in his last days he's appeared amen once and for all they take away sin praise god hallelujah oh god god is good amen don't want to go too fast you're with me this morning hallelujah god got away praise god god gotta wait for you to get out praise god but you oh he said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ not father son the holy ghost but in the name of jesus christ because jesus christ is father in the beginning son and redemption and holy ghost in the church today amen praise god so what it is god amen coming down from god above us to god with us and to god in us amen praise god same god praise god from spirit to flesh praise god back to spirit are you with me same god father of all through all and in you all are you with me i'm talking about all father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name i i hope i hope you understand that we got one father the everlasting father the prince of peace amen unto us and a son is given amen and the government shall be upon his shoulder his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god amen everlasting father and what i wonder who is that do you know who your father is amen he said when you see me you see amen because i am my father are you with me this one god amen one lord one faith one one oh it's no way get you can't get around it you got to come in at the door that you come in at the wonder it meant you won't have a wedding garment friend how you got in here without a wedding garment oh i got into the title father son and holy ghost but i didn't use the name are you you got to use the name of jesus christ for the name of the lord in the what at the name of jesus every knee and every are you with me you need the name of jesus what's the matter with jesus amen there's nothing wrong with the name of jesus neither is there salvation in what any other name but there's no other name under heaven one by men amen you can't get you can't get it no other way praise god if thou should confess with the mouth the lord jesus and believe in thy heart that god is raising from the dead that god shall be what oh yes you've got to believe this if you are a real true believer you'll believe it amen if you want to get out to sin you'll believe it but he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall not you might you shall receive what and if you don't have it something's wrong and god the bible said it's impossible with god to what god could he cannot lie amen praise god who cannot lie and if god can't lie if you repent and be baptized in water in the name of jesus christ what a mission to sin you what and if you don't have it amen something wrong with your repentance because the word is right you'll get it if you do it if you don't have it check out whether or not you obey in the word god keeps his promises isn't that right if god promised you anything you could stand on it the bible said which god who cannot lie promise amen god okay he saved us not to put in the way of the filth of the flesh come on but it is the answer of a good conscience toward god by the way amen when you're baptized in jesus name you baptize and lock into his death you're buried with him and you're rising in the likeness of his resurrection amen so you're walking in newness of life amen it's a new life that god is bringing you into a new life that's right are you up if any man be in christ he is a what new creature he's a new creature he's a new creation right man all things are passed away behold all things become new isn't that right so god wants to make you a new creation hallelujah the devil don't like the word amen because it takes the cover off the devil amen praise god the devil amen can't hide no more when the word come forth it shines the light praise god the bat don't like light it blinds him amen that's why he come out in the night praise god he loved the darkness amen he said men love darkness rather than light because they're what these are evil amen if you want to do right you'll love the light the interest of that word given light amen praise the god god said amen hallelujah you let there be light and there was light what happened to the dawl does it disappear okay so by the grace of god he said i said souls that are in prison now he said who has gone into heaven and is in the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made what subject to him are you with me i'm telling you we're serving a a a good god a wonderful savior that amen got us out of the prison house amen house of hell giveaway amen to the name of jesus it's something to be free amen and come into that place that ark that place of safety come into that uh come into that holy of holiness coming to the secret place and dwelling under the shadows of his wings come there praise god come into the inner veil come and hide amen so by the grace of god here it says in uh ephesians 2 ephesians 2 by the grace of god ephesians 2 and 5. the bible tells us in ephesians 2 and you has a quickened you has been made a lie amen even when you we were dead in sin has he what has he made us alive as he quickened i mean you got to realize where god brought you and i from you has he made alive has he quickened has he made a lie i'm glad that god because he live i live amen isn't that right you got a father that gave his life for you amen that you can live amen jesus died that we could live praise god and when we die amen to ourselves he lives praise god souls that are in prison we know the nature of the spirit is the soul praise god it wasn't our spirit that god it was the nature of your spirit die that's right are you with me the soul is the what it's the nature of the what it's the nature of the spirit praise god he said the soul that sinneth it shall what die amen all souls are mine but the soul that sin is that you die isn't that right so an adam all died because of sin amen so here we are again it was yours it wasn't your spirit that died it was the nature of your spirit that died are you with me so he said in ephesians 2 and 5 even when we were dead in our sins has he quickened has he made alive that he quickened us together with christ by grace are you worth by grace are you saved are we with it the grace of god has been extended to us and we're saved by grace not a works at least any shabbos it is the what it's the gift of god god's gift to you and i is salvation and we ought to be happy because god ought to be most outstanding people on the earth we can walk with our heads up and say thank you lord i'm saved i don't care what has happened nothing to separate me from the love of god that is in christ jesus are you with me so i mean every i mean it's so many things that can oppress you so many things that could come against you can persecute you all kind of false stuff and all kind of oh goodness it's so much in this world could come against you but thank god i'm seen. i can rise above it all why because i'm saved praise god amen not life not death not angels no principles and no powers praise god i'm ashamed praise god so look i got something to be happy and excited about i'm saying praise god jesus died for me he paid the price i believe the report love me praise god you got a lot of folk might hate you a lot of things might be against you but if god be false who can be against us i'm so glad i got god hey on the inside there's something about the name of jesus hallelujah it's wonderful to have jesus it's a good thing to have the love of god in a wicked world it's a good thing to be saved oh ain't got good to you praise god don't you have a father and you can say happy father's day thank you father hallelujah glad to have you as a father for my father amen he'll never forsake me he'll never leave me he's always there for me hallelujah thank you happy father's day praise god it's always god day because this is the day the lord has me i will rejoice and i'll be glad in it i'm so happy today to have a father that cares about me praise god that it looked up for me praise god hallelujah praise god it's good amen to have a god like this amen so he it says by grace are you saved it's very important that we understand that god has saved us not only he has he saved us but ephesians 4 30 says not only has he saved us he said grieve not the what grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye or what seal until when the holy you know if you if you're not kept it's because you don't want to be killed somebody said well you know sometimes something happened to church somehow to the preacher the bible says you're sealed by the holy spirit until what until the preacher backs alive until somebody in the church says something wrong to you are you up man praise god till your children turn it back on you till your wife deny you till your husband walk away you're sealing to what day of redemption you got something that's oh god something that's gonna don't stand the test amen that's something you can go through the fire oh hallelujah hallelujah because you'll be tried and you're favored like pure gold praise god what happened to you when you're going through your persecution and your trials it's getting all the amen the fire trials amen what he's doing is just purging getting everything action come on somebody somebody came and sat down with me in the office yesterday and he was telling me about his troubles and uh and i i understood that amen the things in this life is not i i i said i can't come to your rescue brother i'm sorry i can't come to the rescue but the things that i want you to know amen if your soul is right with god amen i'm more concerned about your soul than any of these corner and natural things are you with me see sometimes folk came in a discouraged they want you to have them in the natural to secure this and secure that but the soul is what we're interested in praise god i say hey hey hey brother here's one of my cards i'm more interested in your soul and where your soul gonna be amen your natural the natural things and all of that i'm interested in your soul praise god it is if you need me you can call me are you up man but all this natural stuff and all this kind of stuff it'll pass away so don't get tired up and ain't been all worked up about it because it'll pass away praise god don't worry about the child don't worry about money don't worry about this or that your soul is important praise god hallelujah god's come to set you free amen oh lord souls that are in prison people are are living in a i said the the the dimensions amen there's been a blending of dimensions people are actually living in a the world has come where hell lead has been taken off and there's been a blending where hell is virgin on earth the prophet of god was in uh j.c pennings and he saw what he saw in hell and he said to himself am i in hell again are you with me because when he was dying he went over there in that dimension and he recognized that he was lost and he asked god to save him because he realized that he was lost then amen the dimensions amen are blending again but in jcpenney what he saw in hell he saw the women looking like that just like what he saw when he was in hell when he was in that place of dying and i'm gonna tell you something amen the prophet of god says now i want you to understand that we're mammal the difference between an animal and a man is we have a soul amen and because we have a soul amen when god made man he was spirit man in genesis one he was spirit man and man was in the image of god but in genesis 2 he made man of the dust of the ground because he had no man to tear the soul are you with me so here god amen looking at man and amen and they needed someone to saw so he made man of the dust of the ground and then he blew in his nostrils to breath in life and man became a what a living soul okay okay so man had a soul now praise god but in the image of god amen praise god he wasn't worried about nothing praise god even with the living soul man could walk around and had no shame he was naked isn't that right he didn't need no clothes no other animal had clothes and no other animal have clothes the only animal that has clothes is man and what is what are the clothes there for to hide their what their necking is their shame not now in this age in this age amen there's been a blending of dimensions are you with me so people are not shamed to walk around naked because why no animal so men are acting like brute what rupees are you up man so the man is trying to take on his animal like nature that they want to be naked amen but because they have a soul that should be shamed amen but because a man should be shamed but he's not ashamed to be naked because in the layout of the series they'll be blind naked wretched poor miserable and they wouldn't even know they're naked they're blind and don't even know they're blind amen this is the most deceptive age amen praise god people are so blind till they have come to church and they're set up and they're naked and the preacher scared to say something about it are you with me praise god they're trying to sit down with what they got on and trying to pull it now amen there is nothing but a fig leaf amen but when god the holy ghost come in the place of god ever come in praise god it'll bring about ashamedness and they'll try to hide praise god to people amen they're just not hearing the word lock the heart praise god but if god presence and god anoint and come in it'll change folks out loud praise god it'll change what they praise god people will be ashamed to come in the house of the lord for in his presence amen praise god it's something about you bringing the presence of god in the house amen it's something about you bringing the anointing of god inside of you folks can walk in your presence and not feel condemned praise god you're talking about walking in the church and not feeling condemned we're walking in your presence they should know that the presence of god is in you the anointing of god is in you you don't have to tell them that praise god is something about the presence of god praise god the people feel condemned praise god then what happens when a person is running from the presence of god then they run from you run from your presence they'll avoid you because there's something inside of you condemn them amen praise god hallelujah bride don't push a cute bride the truth will set you free praise god the word come amen praise god to witness to you what you already got inside of you praise god and that's the life of god there's no condemnation to them that what in christ jesus are you with me the reason why folks are condemned because they're not in him they just imagine they are they presume they venture without authority they think they are they meant praise god as a man thinking in his heart amen there's a way to seem it right to a man are you with me people just uh amen wonder amen it's a possibility that i'm wrong uh-uh no you can't take a chance with your soul amen the word is right amen praise god oh god i gotta i gotta close some kind of way i'm trying to well buy you a seal until the day of redemption god sees you to the day of redemption let's go to colossians three i got the clothes see if those brothers come up here and they're closing me i got to close i'm coming to a close praise god god is good amen the nature of the soul is god if you're born again amen are you a man if you're born again the nature of the soul is god oh you would be that's only if you're born again not because you say i believe the message not because you say brother simmons i go to broad tabernacle not because you said amen it's because god testifies of himself praise god you love the truth amen amen but if you love a lie amen if you don't love the truth god can give you a strong delusion that you believe or what amen but if you love the word you love the truth the truth or what it'll set you free and whom the son is set free is what oh yes you feel good but if you got something to hide amen you can't hide from the word so if you can't hide you go to what you do like adam did you run oh you're with me oh god what is it in this hour that god can what more can he do as my mom used to say what more can he do he's laid the foundation he's opened up the way what more can he do are you with me what more can god do for us what has he not done for you what more can he do after he's done it all for you oh you look man colossians 3 i'm almost just started the first verse if you then be risen with christ what seek those things what y'all what where christ said it's on the right hand of god set your what on things above and not on the things that what i'm gonna tell you there's so many doors open in the spirit realm and and so many doors open in the natural realm that a lot of times i could just see amen the devil offered you if you want to become an instant millionaire here it is and i can say oh lord bye then sometimes you say show me whether you can be an instant millionaire i can't show you that amen but if god want to do that he'll do it are you with me and i and you don't even have to work for it god has just given it to you that's right people that work to be rich and labor to be rich they lose their soul amen but if you seek first or what and here's what then he said what are you with me see it comes to you god gives it to you if you seek him first he'll take care of the you just put him first and watch god that's what it's because of our mindset we think amen we got to go get it but god will give it to you if you just wait on god and let god work in your life give him your best oh you can't outgive god get in prayer get in fire to seek him lord i need more of you hallelujah i want to please you lord i need you i don't need more money i need more of god praise god when i get enough of god money come i said money coming all i got to do is get god right praise god amen god open up something you never thought of praise god money coming i can i can hear it now talking to somebody they're coming praise god hallelujah praise god somebody to get better to be blessed abundantly praise god amen don't even have to try to get it god's just going to lay it praise god god hallelujah i got to close but you know the prophet god was talking about man was made he had the feminine and the masculine spirit in him and god had to put him in sleep to take out the feminine spirit which was eve and he called the feminine that was love but it was fully your love that man has for his wife are you with me so when he took eve out there was a philly philia love that man should have for his wife are you with me so i want to say god has a agape love for his bride are you with me now this love agape love it it stands the test feeling your love is the natural type love but agape love is god's love that's right and perfect love is god's love it's agape love all you look man see we got we get the affiliate love and agape love confused amen and if you want to love your wife or your companion right you got to get there god pay love or you if you want to love one another right you got to get a god pain amen and the bible tells us the love of god is shedded abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost that's god's love praise god god god's love don't love under condition god's love is unconditional you love me i love you back god love amen jesus nothing could uh uh take away god character i don't care if they spit on them i don't care if they whip them i don't care delight on him nothing can make him hate them because god is what god is loving what a father that we have and if we're his children amen by those men would know that you are his disciples because you what you love what one another isn't that right amen so that love that god had for us he transferred it amen when he died he put that same spirit and we said the soul is the nature of the spirit isn't that right so that nature of that spirit is agape love are you with me so god put his agape love inside of you that you can walk in perfect love and you can love your enemies you can love them that's jealous of you those that despise you those that hate you those that lie on you you still can love them because you got their god paid are you with me what a wonderful savior we what a wonderful god we have brother and sister i said happy father's day we have our father and we know our father is jesus christ amen and those souls that are in prison look at the world amen as the lids have been taken out for hell then we see the demons that has has pressed themselves into human beings and they're tattooing and cutting themselves putting all kind of images all over their self and not a shame i said what makes a a woman would put all kind of images writing all over her and then uh men uh they're so tracked up and the bible talked about don't put comments on you and images but people are going to get a tattoo because demons are driving them into those tattooed houses when you when you pass a tattoo house you look it's almost demons spirits settling there and inviting those that are uh uh are blind and naked come on and get a tattoo amen and they get in there they tell when they get one of jesus getting one of the cross and getting one of oh god putting those images on there man should not wash graven images isn't that right and they're getting engraving images on them isn't that right so we're going into a place where hell lead souls that are in prison now people walk around then they lost it the last message in the days of noah he preached unto the total what loss people who have gone too far they're going amen too far they've crossed over brother and sister be careful that you don't cross over cross over into that other dimension be careful that you don't find yourself on the other side in prison souls that are in prison amen they'll cross over into another dimension amen that don't don't even know they walk around dead praise god without god they can hear the word but they can't cross back because the rich man heard and saw ladders but he couldn't cross back over they heard noah preaching but they could not cross back over praise god when the reigns came and the floods came they couldn't crawl they couldn't get in amen the last message would be to the total loss where are we brother are we talking to the total loss are we preaching to those that can't get in they can't come in and be saved oh and we come to that point where folks are just satisfied and happy they meant don't believe that it's time to come on in the ark before the storm come before the the fire fall before that sixth seal is really let loose then his poorness upon the great tribulation begin to hit the earth the pestilence and the different things that are happening now ought to give us that this is a full runner or what's getting ready to happen to the earth but you got to come on in the act amen because cancer will just be like a toothache for what's getting ready to hit the earth but yet we're not we we we we find ourselves outside and cross over into the love of god into the shadow into god's secret place why won't we cross over amen are you totally lost are you too far gone i isn't something inside of you said i want to be saved i need jesus i want the holy ghost right i want to be a child of god i want to be a daughter a son of god i want to be saved i know the world is pulling on them [Music] the world is pulling on those that reject god praise god to reject god dead in your sins and if you be dead with christ that means that old nature is gone you let the old nature the old man has been crucified the old old simmons have been crucified the old henry has been crucified your own nature has been crucified and died and now you take on the new nature amen which is the holy ghost which is the life of god that's what god is saying is this is this high up there is just deep teaching is just deep preaching i said if you believe it it'll deliver you it'll take you into a place of god it'll set you free praise god it'll put you on the mountaintop it'll make you the head and not the tail praise
