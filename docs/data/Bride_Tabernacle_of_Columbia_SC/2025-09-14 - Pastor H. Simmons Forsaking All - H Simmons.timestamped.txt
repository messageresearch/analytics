[37:41] As we stand for reading the book of St.
[37:43] Luke 14th chapter and we're going to
[37:46] begin at the 25th verse. I'll read the
[37:48] first, you read the next and we'll read
[37:51] the latter verse together.
[37:54] Luke 14
[37:58] and 25.
[38:08] And there went great multitudes with
[38:11] him.
[38:12] And he turned and said unto them 26,
[38:16] &gt;&gt; if any man come to me and not his father
[38:20] and mother and wife and children and
[38:22] brother and sister in his own life also,
[38:26] he cannot be my disciple.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; And whosoever doeth not bear his cross
[38:35] and come after me cannot be my
[38:38] disciples. 28
[38:39] &gt;&gt; For you intending to build tower sitt
[38:50] &gt;&gt; least hardly after he has laid the
[38:53] foundation and is not able to finish it.
[38:58] All that behold it began to mark him. 30
[39:04] &gt;&gt; saying this man began to build and was
[39:07] not able to finish.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, what king goeth to war against
[39:14] another king setth not down first and
[39:19] consult whether he be able with 10,000
[39:24] to meet him that cometh against him with
[39:28] 20,000.
[39:30] 32
[39:37] [Applause]
[39:40] &gt;&gt; So likewise whosoever
[39:44] he be of you that forsaketh not all that
[39:50] he has. He cannot be my disciples. 34
[40:02] &gt;&gt; together. It neither is fit for the
[40:05] land, nor yet for the donill, but men
[40:09] cast it out. He that has an ear, let him
[40:13] hear. God bless you. May you be seated.
[40:17] Praise God.
[40:19] We want to talk to you
[40:22] familiar word forsaken all.
[40:26] Forsaken all.
[40:30] The prophet God kind of spoke on that.
[40:32] Forsaken all. Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Uh are we willing to forsake everything?
[40:40] And that's I I I find that many I I
[40:43] believe that
[40:45] the foundation has to be laid in each
[40:47] and every one of our lives.
[40:49] And often times I tell about my
[40:51] Christian walk as I started out a lot of
[40:56] times as a teenager, you know, I got
[40:58] baptized and everything and you don't
[41:00] wanted to be a Christian,
[41:03] but you know,
[41:06] you sometimes you look around in the
[41:08] church and see other young people and
[41:10] you're just 18 years old and you want to
[41:14] you want to serve the Lord, but you look
[41:16] around at all the other young people
[41:19] and and you see what they're doing
[41:22] and sometimes you it stumbles you
[41:25] because you come from
[41:28] the world and you come to God and and
[41:31] you see the young people that perhaps
[41:34] they were supposed to be Christian all
[41:36] their life
[41:38] but yet it's a stumbling block for a
[41:41] young person coming in
[41:45] and seeing they don't have a desire or a
[41:47] lot of young people didn't have a desire
[41:50] to to be Christians, but they were just
[41:52] raised in the church, but their desires
[41:55] in their heart, they want to be out in
[41:57] the street
[41:59] and you talk.
[42:01] So goodness, you coming from that kind
[42:05] of lifestyle and you know not really,
[42:09] you know, getting depth in the streets,
[42:11] but you know, you come from the streets
[42:15] and the young people as a whole that's
[42:19] reared up, they wanted to experience
[42:21] some of the things you've experienced
[42:25] and then they can say, "Well, then I can
[42:27] come back and serve the Lord." But I
[42:29] said, "Oh, no.
[42:31] A lot of young people in my day, they
[42:33] didn't make it through.
[42:36] They didn't make it to get 18.
[42:39] A lot of them uh if they were 18, some
[42:41] of them are doing 20 years.
[42:44] And a lot of them, you know, lost their
[42:46] lives as young people or they was became
[42:50] almost drug addicts or alcoholic.
[42:53] I mean, most of a lot of the football
[42:56] players that played football that was
[42:58] supposed to be making the pros, man,
[43:01] those guys became
[43:04] heron addicts and and they were sniffing
[43:07] cocaine in high school. And a lot of
[43:10] times
[43:11] you you look for them to be successful,
[43:15] but by the grace of God, I want I want
[43:17] you to consider forsaking all.
[43:20] I had to come to a a time that I didn't
[43:23] look at others.
[43:25] I think we spent our times as Christian
[43:27] looking at what other people do.
[43:31] But as I was praying, I said, "God, what
[43:34] should I say this morning?" He says,
[43:37] "Forsaken all. You got to give it up
[43:41] all." And I'm I'm telling you, sometimes
[43:44] people serve the Lord for 20, 30, 40, 50
[43:46] years,
[43:48] and they haven't got this. They hadn't
[43:50] even started right. They never started
[43:53] right.
[43:54] And I said, you know, but I thank God
[43:57] for his grace upon my life that one day
[44:00] I had to realize if I really wanted to
[44:03] be
[44:04] a Christian and if I really wanted to go
[44:09] to heaven and if I really wanted this
[44:11] that I had to give it up all.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we come to a stage
[44:16] we give up a little this, a little of
[44:18] that. I didn't have a problem with
[44:20] drinking, smoking, uh, you know, but I
[44:23] had my problems. You going to get into
[44:26] that.
[44:28] I had my problems. You know what I'm
[44:30] saying?
[44:32] But, you know, by the grace of God, we
[44:35] we were born in sin shaped in iniquity.
[44:38] Sometimes people don't see a need of
[44:41] change in their life. But I saw a need
[44:44] because I I looked at my future
[44:48] and where I was going.
[44:51] My wife and I was talking about it the
[44:52] other day. She said while she was in
[44:54] college, she seen those older fellas
[44:57] maybe 25, 30 years old on the college
[45:00] campus come every year for to talk to
[45:02] the freshman.
[45:04] I said, "Yeah." And I looked at that
[45:07] life. I said, "Uh-uh.
[45:10] No. I I mean it's just graduating and
[45:13] then I looked at you know the fellas
[45:16] that you know and they at 18 and 21 they
[45:19] can go into the nightclub and all of
[45:21] that and they can drink and
[45:25] do you want that is that happiness is
[45:28] that joy. See what people want to be
[45:31] they want to be free. They want to be
[45:33] happy. They want to have a a a
[45:36] a blessing a phony a phony joy. People
[45:41] are not real. They're not really at
[45:43] peace because if they don't serve the
[45:45] Lord, they have to accept the
[45:48] invitation.
[45:50] They have to accept a pacify, something
[45:52] that won't satisfy them, but yet it
[45:55] it'll make them feel a little a little
[45:58] pleasure for a moment. make them feel a
[46:01] little happy for a season. But that's
[46:04] not why God ma how God made us for a
[46:07] purpose. He made us in the image and the
[46:10] likeness of God. Made man in his image
[46:12] and his likeness. So God meant from the
[46:15] beginning for you to be sons and
[46:17] daughters of God.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[46:21] &gt;&gt; So if you miss your purpose in life,
[46:26] you miss your purpose in life. what God
[46:29] put you in this world or let you come in
[46:32] this world to do.
[46:35] If you miss that, then you uh
[46:40] you you're miserable and you'll keep on
[46:43] thirsting, keep on hungering for
[46:46] something and you'll never be able to
[46:48] achieve it until you get God.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Somebody praise God. uh
[46:56] forsaken all
[46:59] now
[47:02] counting up the cost. I had to just
[47:05] surrender everything.
[47:08] I when I when I I I mean it didn't
[47:12] matter if nobody went, nobody served the
[47:14] Lord. I didn't care. I mean I had to
[47:17] just get I wanted God for myself. I
[47:20] wanted to know God for myself. So, you
[47:23] know, you get around 19 and you this
[47:26] ain't working. You know, in and out,
[47:28] backward and forward. That ain't
[47:29] working. I got to get down in the
[47:31] business.
[47:34] But, but 19,
[47:37] this ain't working.
[47:40] So, I had to get past all the
[47:43] distraction. I had to look at Jesus and
[47:45] see the need of God for myself in my
[47:48] life. And you got to get past all the
[47:51] distractions, all the other stuff that's
[47:53] keeping you from serving the Lord and
[47:56] giving him your all.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; See, he started off if any man come
[48:01] after me, you know, he got to deny his
[48:04] father, mother, you know, hate, you
[48:07] know, hate, you got to give them, I
[48:09] mean, you can't let them be first. God
[48:12] has to be first in your life. Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; But sometime we get we got family got
[48:17] this got that all kind of pro things
[48:19] first. But God has to be your absolute
[48:23] he must have to be he has to be first in
[48:25] your life.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; So you got to and then he says your
[48:31] brother your sister you got got to hate
[48:33] him. That's what he says. In other words
[48:36] you got to you know you can't love them
[48:38] more than you love God.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; You can't let them be God. Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying?
[48:47] But sometimes
[48:49] your your family would separate cause
[48:52] you not to serve the Lord
[48:55] and it cause you not to get in the
[48:57] position in the place where God want you
[48:59] to be.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you let that be your anchor.
[49:05] But God wants to be your anchor. Then he
[49:08] says, "Not only that, then whosoever do
[49:12] not bear his cross." So serving the
[49:16] Lord, he said a cross. You know Jesus
[49:18] bear a cross.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He went through something for you
[49:22] and I.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; The one that was in the world and the
[49:26] world was made by him. Yeah. And and all
[49:28] of that, he went through severe
[49:32] hatred and pain, sorrow, and suffering
[49:36] for you. And I didn't have to do it, but
[49:39] he he he showed us a pathway.
[49:42] And all the agony and pain and all that
[49:45] he suffered, he was doing that for you
[49:47] and I that you might know that he's a
[49:51] God that touched by the feeling of your
[49:53] infirmity. And then not only did he go
[49:56] through it for you and Amen. He showed
[49:59] you that this is the way you I Jesus
[50:03] bear the cross. Why don't you bear your
[50:05] take up your cross?
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; But he's offering you something.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He did it for us. We couldn't give
[50:13] him nothing, but he wanted to give us
[50:15] something.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; If you take up your cross and you follow
[50:18] him, he wants to give you eternal life.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to bless you. Amen. Uh,
[50:24] is it a blessing taking up my cross?
[50:27] Yes, it's a blessing when you take up
[50:29] your cross and follow him.
[50:33] Be his disciples.
[50:36] Now, I I I I I want you to know that we
[50:41] used to fashion ourselves after the
[50:43] world. We want to look like the world.
[50:45] We want to act like the world. with with
[50:49] us we unknowingly
[50:52] we want to look a certain way because we
[50:55] were conforming to the image of the
[50:58] world. The Bible tells us not to be
[51:01] conformed to this world but be you
[51:03] transformed by the renewing of your
[51:05] mind. We wanted to conform. We were
[51:08] conforming to an image and that image
[51:11] usually come from Hollywood.
[51:14] Are you with me? how the people are uh
[51:17] are are dressing or how they're looking,
[51:20] how the football players, the basketball
[51:23] players, which all are miserable
[51:26] miserable lives. They look, they smile
[51:29] and they're happy. Amen. But you know,
[51:32] you don't know the pain that they go
[51:33] through. You don't know the sorrow and
[51:36] agony that they go through. and and and
[51:39] then they they they look a certain way
[51:41] and they have a certain image or a
[51:43] certain persona and and sometimes we
[51:46] want to follow that image and think,
[51:48] "Oh, I'm cool. Oo, this is nice."
[51:52] Man don't know that the after the
[51:55] effects of all of that stuff.
[51:58] But he said, "Be my disciple."
[52:01] If you be his disciple, how I how do how
[52:04] do the other children going to look at
[52:06] me? How my family going to look at me to
[52:10] be his disciple?
[52:13] You mean to tell me in in order to be
[52:15] his disciple, I got to carry this cross.
[52:18] I mean, you know, I I got family that I
[52:20] love, but I want to be his disciple. You
[52:24] got to take up your cross.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; To be a disciple. And that's what I'm
[52:30] saying. A lot of people start on this
[52:32] Christian walk, but they hadn't really
[52:35] they hadn't really uh uh uh had a good
[52:38] foundationbased Christian walk. It's
[52:42] it's all in he said if the foundation be
[52:45] destroyed, what can the righteous do?
[52:48] The foundation. Amen. You got to lay a a
[52:52] foundation. Your foundation must be
[52:54] built upon the rock and not the sand.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz the wind's going to blow and
[53:00] the storm going to come. And if your
[53:02] foundation and you are anchored on the
[53:04] rock,
[53:05] &gt;&gt; it's going to blow you away.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; The flood's going to drown you.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Things are coming in the life. Amen.
[53:13] That'll knock you. Amen. That'll rock
[53:16] you, that'll shake you. But if you on
[53:19] that solid rock, you don't have to worry
[53:21] about it.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go through the storm. The
[53:25] storm. Amen.
[53:28] It won't hurt you.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Your roots will just get deeper.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[53:35] &gt;&gt; So,
[53:36] uh, as you look at this, he says, uh,
[53:40] that you take up your cross and and
[53:44] except you take up your cross, you
[53:46] cannot be my disciple. Uh and then he it
[53:49] went on to say which of you intending to
[53:52] build a tower not send it down and count
[53:55] up the cost whether you have sufficient
[53:57] to finish it. I say a a lot of times we
[54:00] didn't take time to you know to really
[54:04] you don't look at it am I get am I
[54:08] really surrendering all you know or am I
[54:11] just coming to a point I'm tired of
[54:13] living like this I don't want to do this
[54:15] I want to be a Christian I want to be
[54:17] saved but that's nice
[54:21] that's you know that's just general
[54:24] faith but is it as we said in uh Bible
[54:27] study isn't intellectual your faith or
[54:30] is it faith that's coming from your
[54:32] heart because you can receive Jesus
[54:35] intellectually in your mind but not in
[54:38] your heart.
[54:39] So the prophet talked about down in your
[54:41] soul
[54:43] down deep that you receiving Jesus
[54:46] Christ down in your soul.
[54:49] The Bible said repent and be baptized
[54:51] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[54:52] Christ for the remission of sin and you
[54:54] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[54:56] Ghost. Ain't that right? But you wonder
[54:58] why you haven't received the gift of the
[55:00] Holy Ghost. Because God wants to Amen.
[55:03] God wants you to surrender all. Amen.
[55:06] There's no It's no It's no way you can
[55:08] get the Holy Ghost until you come into
[55:10] that place that you willing to surrender
[55:13] all. And I'm going to tell you I if you
[55:17] think that Amen. living a Christian
[55:19] life, you don't have a cross to carry,
[55:21] you don't have a cross to bear, then
[55:23] you're wrong. He telling you from the
[55:26] beginning, if you going to come after me
[55:28] and you're going to be my disciple, you
[55:29] take up your cross, it's going to be
[55:31] some pain. It's going to be some
[55:33] suffering. It's going to be some things
[55:35] you're going to go through. But I think
[55:36] God is worth it.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; It's worth all our suffering, all our
[55:40] pain. All we have to give up. God, Amen.
[55:43] going to give us something better.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; I mean, if he if anything he asked you
[55:47] to give up, he got something better to
[55:49] give you in return.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But see, but um now do
[55:55] we believe that
[55:56] &gt;&gt; some people are sat down and they they
[55:59] don't have but uh $50 in the bank.
[56:03] And now I I'm using the money as a as a
[56:06] scenario, but that that's not what I'm
[56:08] talking about. Some folk hold on to
[56:10] their $50 and won't give it up
[56:14] and God want to give them a million
[56:16] dollars,
[56:17] but they just so satisfied with their
[56:19] $50, they think they rich.
[56:22] You know what I'm saying? And and and
[56:24] the little uh uh little uh uh uh life
[56:27] that they have, the little uh uh little
[56:30] things that they're holding on to that
[56:32] they don't want to give up, they hold on
[56:34] to that because they think they got
[56:36] something.
[56:38] Oh, I got it. What you got? I'm pretty.
[56:41] What? What you got? I'm handsome. I'm
[56:43] cool. You holding on to that?
[56:47] That's what's keeping you from being his
[56:48] disciple?
[56:50] Amen. I I got some things that I'm doing
[56:53] that I know it ain't right, but I I I I
[56:56] ain't ready to give it up.
[56:59] You know, who wouldn't would be ready to
[57:02] give something up when I'm getting
[57:04] something of such great value? Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; You know, I I mean, I might not want a
[57:10] Rolls Roy, but I you know, that that old
[57:14] um 2012,
[57:18] I not somebody give me a Rolls-Royce,
[57:20] I'll give it,
[57:23] you know, for a Rolls Roy. Even though I
[57:25] don't want one or Maser, what you call
[57:27] it?
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Maserati or whatever y'all want to call
[57:30] it, I give it up, you know. I I I I
[57:33] appreciate that old 2012 out there, but
[57:37] I I'll be glad to give it up. Somebody
[57:40] want to give me something way better.
[57:42] And I'm talking about God want to give
[57:43] you a better life, but you want to hold
[57:46] no
[57:51] you can have this if you going to give
[57:53] me something better, right?
[57:54] &gt;&gt; But you know, most people, Amen, they
[57:57] don't believe his report.
[58:00] They don't believe that God got a better
[58:02] life for you. God want to give you more
[58:04] than Amen. more than you could ever
[58:07] imagine.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your mind can't even conceive what
[58:12] God want to do for you and through you
[58:15] and in you. Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; So
[58:23] &gt;&gt; you got to kind I I'm using this life
[58:26] scenario that you know you're building
[58:30] a a and you're building a house,
[58:32] building a building, but your life is is
[58:35] you you you're a temple and you're a
[58:37] building and God is building your
[58:40] character, building you up as an
[58:42] individual and he's trying to build you
[58:44] into the stature of a perfect man. He's
[58:47] bringing you into maturity. Amen. You
[58:50] know, sometimes parents don't have time
[58:52] for their children to mold their image.
[58:55] And so the school teacher in the
[58:57] schoolhouse are kind of try to help you
[59:00] out a little, but they can't help you.
[59:02] so much. The parents should be, you
[59:05] know, molding you and and shaping you in
[59:09] in in such a way that they know that you
[59:12] can handle life when you come uh to a
[59:16] certain age. That you can handle
[59:18] driving, you can handle a a job, you can
[59:22] handle getting out and getting out the
[59:24] house where we can have some more room.
[59:32] You know what I'm saying? They looking
[59:33] forward to that day.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Do you having children and having a
[59:40] family and they got some grands?
[59:44] They looking forward to that day. So
[59:47] what what they what they got to do is
[59:49] prepare you and try to get you ready for
[59:52] it. Ain't that right?
[59:54] &gt;&gt; So they're they're preparing you for
[59:56] that. that you know how to treat your
[59:59] husband, you know how to treat your
[1:00:00] wife, you know how to, you know, you
[1:00:02] know how to live. You know, parents are
[1:00:04] trying to get you to that place.
[1:00:08] Now, if they don't care, they just you
[1:00:10] just eat and drink and they going about
[1:00:13] their business. I had friends, parents
[1:00:16] with school teachers and different uh
[1:00:19] you know different types of jobs and and
[1:00:21] I went to their house and mama get in,
[1:00:24] she take her drink, daddy get in, take a
[1:00:28] drink, they go to their bedroom,
[1:00:30] you know, I didn't have, you know, rich
[1:00:32] parents and all of that. And I call him
[1:00:35] rich back then, you know, cuz we came up
[1:00:38] 15 of us, you know.
[1:00:40] You know, but but you know, mama had
[1:00:43] time to sit down and talk to you, daddy
[1:00:46] and all these little things. He got some
[1:00:48] wise sans and son this and son that, you
[1:00:52] know, but I said to these people, you
[1:00:55] know, they teach school, they have
[1:00:57] professional jobs and all, but seem like
[1:01:00] they ain't had no time for their
[1:01:01] children. I said, "Oh, this is strange."
[1:01:03] So I went from house to house with my
[1:01:05] friends and they included me with the
[1:01:09] you know the middle class at that time.
[1:01:13] I said I didn't think I was middle class
[1:01:15] but I'm saying but it's no time. So
[1:01:19] people go to church and they're listen

[1:01:38] this, and a plan for that, and it's all
[1:01:40] about money. And then they give you a
[1:01:43] hype sermon to hype you up and lift you

[1:02:09] tower. Amen. And not set it down and
[1:02:13] counting up the cost. Have you
[1:02:15] considered the cost? Have you considered
[1:02:17] going the other way? What how much the
[1:02:20] devil going to pay you?
[1:02:23] Because payday is coming after a while.
[1:02:24] Whatever a man sow, he going to what?

[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; See, the devil is offering you stuff,
[1:02:41] but is it worth your soul?
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:02:50] words. And yet you holding on to it

[1:02:57] Knowing that your soul, he said, you
[1:02:59] know, one day he said, your soul is
[1:03:01] going to be required of you. That's
[1:03:03] right.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; The rich man lifted up his soul in hell.
[1:03:07] Ain't that right?
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And the fire was hot.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Okay, I got to move on. God is good.

[1:03:20] after he had laid the foundation and not
[1:03:23] able to finish it. All that beholded it
[1:03:27] began to mark him. Now I don't want
[1:03:30] people to mark your Christian walk.
[1:03:33] I want your Christian walk to be solid.
[1:03:36] I want it to be firm and sure.
[1:03:40] I don't want people to be marking you.
[1:03:44] Are you with me? See, cuz a lot of times
[1:03:47] people will mark you. Your God ain't
[1:03:49] real. I tried God and God didn't do
[1:03:52] nothing for me. I don't even know what
[1:03:54] it is to God because I I I mean
[1:03:59] and sometimes young people get next to
[1:04:01] them because Amen. They start saying I
[1:04:05] tried. I tried and and God did not do
[1:04:09] this or God didn't do that. I tried God.
[1:04:13] And I'm saying, you know, I'm coming
[1:04:16] back to forsaken all
[1:04:19] if take back your cross.
[1:04:24] Are you with me? So I I I I'm coming
[1:04:27] back to the foundation. Did you forsake
[1:04:30] all? I guarantee you, you ask the
[1:04:32] question, if you wanted to be his
[1:04:34] disciple, did you forsake all? No. So
[1:04:37] how did you really try him? You didn't
[1:04:39] really try him. Amen.
[1:04:42] You you you made an effort to try to
[1:04:46] know him by what? Your intellect, your
[1:04:49] knowledge, but did you try him in in
[1:04:52] your heart? Did you really ask God to
[1:04:54] come into your heart and ask God to take
[1:04:57] control of your life? Were you willing
[1:04:59] to trust him with your life?
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Are are you willing to say, "God, I I
[1:05:04] I'm willing to trust you with my life
[1:05:06] because you can you you can handle my
[1:05:09] life better than I can. Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; You know what I need more than I know
[1:05:15] what I need myself.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; You can help me better than I can help
[1:05:20] myself.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; So why am I holding on to something that
[1:05:23] I can't help myself?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; All that I have, I'm going to count it
[1:10:03] lost.
[1:10:05] Amen.
[1:10:06] It doesn't matter what what achievements
[1:10:08] you have. Paul was a great achiever. He
[1:10:11] was a supposed to be a good church boy.
[1:10:14] Amen. He kept the law. He was blameless.
[1:10:17] He had all the religion. But he was one
[1:10:20] thing he lacked. He was persecuting the
[1:10:22] ones that he thought was wrong.
[1:10:27] He was persecuting the saints of God and
[1:10:30] he got letters to put them in jail
[1:10:34] because they were preaching Jesus.
[1:10:37] I'm telling we getting close to that
[1:10:38] time now.
[1:10:40] We getting close to that hour where

[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:52] It coming in that hour that this this
[1:10:55] this warfare that we saw in the Bible
[1:10:58] become a reality to you and I.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. People Amen. Amen.
[1:11:04] The fellow was saying a lot of good
[1:11:06] thing. They they shot him.
[1:11:10] You know, he was talking about different
[1:11:12] things ought not to be the other day.
[1:11:14] They shot that fellow. I don't know Kurt
[1:11:17] or whatever his name is. But anyway, but
[1:11:21] you can take a stand for God and people
[1:11:23] hate you. You can take a stand for the
[1:11:26] word and people want to kill you.
[1:11:30] Amen. Because they despise. Amen. They
[1:11:33] despise somebody that's standing for
[1:11:35] God. You can't say what's right. Cuz the
[1:11:38] world so backwards when you say what's
[1:11:40] right, they think, Amen. That's a hate
[1:11:43] crime. You telling people what's the
[1:11:46] word of God say and they think you hate
[1:11:48] them. You love them because you tell
[1:11:49] them the truth.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not compromising with the
[1:11:54] word. You telling the folks what the
[1:11:56] word say and they think you hate them.
[1:12:04] I listen to a little bit what that man
[1:12:05] was saying. He saying some good things.
[1:12:08] People shing.
[1:12:10] Amen.
[1:12:11] I don't get into that politics, but a
[1:12:14] lot of times you say some good things,
[1:12:17] people hate you. You try to live a
[1:12:20] Christian life, people will hate you for
[1:12:23] living a Christian life. Why? Because
[1:12:26] it's condemning them, their lifestyle.
[1:12:31] Come on, smoke a joint.
[1:12:33] I got a joint already. I'm smoking.
[1:12:40] You can't get higher than me.
[1:12:44] Amen. Praise God. I'm already I'm
[1:12:48] already high.
[1:12:50] Amen. Ain't that right?
[1:12:53] He said, "Be not drunk with wine, but
[1:12:55] rather be filled with the what?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; With the spirit." Amen. And so what what
[1:13:00] makes you happy? What makes you feel
[1:13:02] good? It's the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; It's Christ.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; I got to close.
[1:13:12] I told you
[1:13:14] but I I count loss.
[1:13:17] That's what Paul is saying. Yay
[1:13:19] doubtless and I count all things.
[1:13:22] Forsaken what? What we said? Forsaken
[1:13:25] what?
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Forsaken all. Then he says, "And I count
[1:13:30] all things but what?
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Laws for the ecstasy of the knowledge of
[1:13:35] Christ Jesus my Lord. for whom I have
[1:13:38] what?
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; I suffered the loss of all things. All
[1:13:43] his degrees and all that schooling he
[1:13:45] went through. Lord have mercy.
[1:13:48] Theological training and coming up a
[1:13:50] Pharisee to the Pharisee. Now I got to
[1:13:53] give all of that up
[1:13:55] cuz I found out I was wrong.
[1:13:59] Amen. I was coming against the truth.
[1:14:03] Coming against Jesus.
[1:14:08] He didn't know Jehovah of the Old
[1:14:09] Testament was Jesus Christ of the New
[1:14:15] but that I may win Christ.
[1:14:20] Then he said that I might be found in
[1:14:22] him, not having my own what?
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Which is of the law, but that which is
[1:14:30] through faith in Christ of Christ, the
[1:14:35] righteousness which is of God by faith.
[1:14:40] Then he says that I may know him in the
[1:14:42] what?
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Resurrection.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; In the power of his resurrection, in the
[1:14:46] fellowship of his what?
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Suffering. and being made conformed of
[1:14:52] uh not to Hollywood but to his what
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Paul says I die daily.
[1:14:59] Are you willing
[1:15:01] to die to yourself, your thoughts, your
[1:15:04] ideas? Are you willing to lose your
[1:15:07] identity
[1:15:09] and be like Christ?
[1:15:11] Have you forsaken all?
[1:15:16] You know, it's one thing to forsake it
[1:15:18] all and then,
[1:15:20] you know, when it came to Lot and his
[1:15:23] wife and his daughters, the angel said,
[1:15:26] "Get out the city and don't look back.
[1:15:29] All your labor and all your
[1:15:30] achievements,
[1:15:33] everything that you got in that city,
[1:15:35] the nice fine house because he was the
[1:15:37] mayor of the city and all of that, all
[1:15:39] of that you got, now you got to get out
[1:15:42] the city because God going to destroy
[1:15:44] it.
[1:15:46] And I'm saying to you, you got to run
[1:15:48] for your life and get out
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; of your sin because God will destroy
[1:15:52] you.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Sin will cause you to die and go to
[1:15:55] hell.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; But if you want to hold on to it now,
[1:16:01] you know your destiny.
[1:16:04] Are you with me?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; But if you willing to uh uh get out now,
[1:16:08] I'm going to tell you something. It must
[1:16:10] was some strong demons in in Sodom. They
[1:16:14] must have had a whole lot there. But
[1:16:16] God's prayer,
[1:16:18] somebody pray for me, brother Gordon,
[1:16:21] had me on their mind. It's some strong
[1:16:24] demon powers that caused them to not to
[1:16:27] want to leave till the angel had to get
[1:16:30] them by the hand
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; and pull them out.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I'm saying, you know, sometime you got
[1:16:38] so much you're holding on to God have to
[1:16:42] take you by the hand and pull you out.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Sometimes Amen. We don't
[1:16:50] know when God's working, God moving.
[1:16:53] Amen. Every time you see things happen
[1:16:55] this way, that way, God talking to you.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; He trying to get your attention and let
[1:17:00] you know, Amen. This is God talking to
[1:17:03] you. This world is not your home. Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you you don't belong in this
[1:17:08] world here. You belong in another world.

[1:17:24] better for you.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; But do you believe it? No.

[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Shake somebody hand and tell them,
[1:18:26] "Let's forsake all.
[1:18:32] Let's give it up all.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Let's give up all. He said
[1:18:41] that's what
[1:18:44] powers in the church now.
[1:18:47] But it is controlled by law. And the law
[1:18:51] is not keeping a bunch of commandments.
[1:18:56] It's a law of faith.
[1:18:59] Jesus said, "All things are possible to
[1:19:01] them that believe."
[1:19:03] If you can believe it,
[1:19:06] whatever
[1:19:09] God will lead your soul to believe,
[1:19:13] that is yours.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Every place the soul of your feet can
[1:19:19] set upon by faith.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen."
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; God gives it to you.
[1:19:28] It's yours.
[1:19:31] You possess it.
[1:19:33] If you can find the key to this law of
[1:19:37] faith
[1:19:39] that opens
[1:19:41] it to you.
[1:19:44] You see what I mean?
[1:19:47] That's power.
[1:19:49] That power is controlled.
[1:19:52] If you are a son of God,
[1:19:58] are you a daughter of God
[1:20:00] that never leaves you?
[1:20:04] It's with you all the time, but your
[1:20:09] faith get away from it,
[1:20:12] but it's still there.
[1:20:17] But of course, that power is controlled
[1:20:20] by faith.
[1:20:25] We've have all us
[1:20:29] a world out there
[1:20:32] living in it.
[1:20:34] But if you a son of God or daughter of
[1:20:38] God,
[1:20:42] you got the power of God in you.
[1:20:47] You got created power.
[1:20:50] I said you got created power.
[1:20:56] You see when we speak anything
[1:21:00] if something is anchored in us to us we
[1:21:04] should never speak it until we can
[1:21:07] believe it.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:12] Then when we believe it, we speak it.
[1:21:17] And that created word goes out.
[1:21:23] It's part of God.
[1:21:26] It creates.
[1:21:32] You have to have faith to speak it.
[1:21:37] It's got creative power in what you
[1:21:40] speak.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; They can change your whole life.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; What you believe what you say.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just say things
[1:21:55] just like not not knowing that we are
[1:21:58] create we are amateur gods and we can
[1:22:01] create.
[1:22:03] Sometime we just set things off the top
[1:22:05] of our head and just set things. Oh, I'm
