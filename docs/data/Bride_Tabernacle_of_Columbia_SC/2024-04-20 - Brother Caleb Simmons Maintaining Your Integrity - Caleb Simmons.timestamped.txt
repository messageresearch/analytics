[31:28] three and 18 amen
[32:04] when you got it say
[32:06] amen amen and it
[32:10] reads actually let's start at the eth
[32:13] verse I got the wrong
[32:18] ver finally be ye all of One mind having
[32:22] compassion of one another love as
[32:25] Brethren be pitiful be C courteous not
[32:29] rendering evil for evil or railing for
[32:32] railing
[32:34] but contrarywise blessing knowing that
[32:38] ye are there unto called and the that ye
[32:41] should inherit a blessing for he that
[32:44] will love life and see good days let him
[32:47] refrain his tongue from evil and his
[32:49] lips that they speak no
[32:52] God let him assure evil and do good let
[32:56] him seek peace and UE ensue it for the
[33:00] eyes of the Lord are over the righteous
[33:02] and his ears are upon are open unto
[33:05] their prayers but the faith of the Lord
[33:08] is against them that do evil and who is
[33:11] he that will harm you if ye be followers
[33:14] of that which is good but and if ye
[33:17] suffer for righteousness sake happy are
[33:20] ye and be not afraid and be not afraid
[33:23] of their Terrors neither be troubled but
[33:26] sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and
[33:29] be ye ready always to give an answer to
[33:32] every man that ask your reason of the
[33:34] hope that is in you for with meekness
[33:36] and
[33:37] fear having a good conscience that
[33:40] whereas they speak evil of you and as of
[33:44] evil doers they may be ashamed that
[33:47] falsely accus good conversation in
[33:50] Christ for it is better if the will of
[33:53] the of God be so that you suffer for
[33:56] well doing than for evil to him for
[33:59] Christ also
[34:00] has has once suffered for sins the just
[34:04] for the unjust that he might bring us to
[34:07] God being put to death in the flesh but
[34:11] quickened by the spirit amen God bless
[34:14] the reading of this word you may be
[34:19] seated amen tonight I'd like to speak on
[34:22] a little topic that I entitled
[34:24] maintaining your inte
[34:26] integrity maintain in your integrity but
[34:29] also as a little subtopic
[34:32] character character and this he points
[34:35] out here how if if you're doing the
[34:38] right thing there's a just reward for
[34:40] you if you're doing the right thing and
[34:42] you're listening to God's word there's a
[34:44] just reward for you it said that but it
[34:48] all comes down to your character and I
[34:51] ask you the question do you care what
[34:53] people say about
[34:56] you when people they look at you whether
[34:59] you like it or not whether you might be
[35:01] the quietest person in the room people
[35:03] are watching you cuz many of us have
[35:05] seen quiet people and we say you know
[35:08] that's a good person or you say man they
[35:10] could be quiet and Silent as a mouse but
[35:12] you say I wouldn't want to be around
[35:15] them it doesn't matter if you're quiet
[35:17] or if you loud and you speak a lot or
[35:19] you talk a lot your character is still
[35:21] speaking about you how you act how you
[35:25] react is also telling people who you are
[35:28] said it's from the intents of the heart
[35:31] that the mouth speaks so sometimes it's
[35:33] some things that are deep inside of you
[35:36] that are speaking out of your mouth that
[35:37] you was like is that me is that me but
[35:40] something is the inside of you that
[35:42] might come out every now and again that
[35:44] said Lord I got to get closer to you cuz
[35:47] Lord I want the right Integrity I don't
[35:49] want just an Integrity I want the right
[35:51] integrity and I want the right character
[35:54] see the Lord he speaks to us and he
[35:55] tells us what you should have what you
[35:58] should have and he gives it to us
[36:00] in in Galatians if we turn there in
[36:04] Galatians chapter
[36:09] 5 said if you have the right inte
[36:12] integrity and the right character in
[36:14] verse 22 it tells you what you should
[36:17] have and what should come out of you he
[36:19] said but the fruits of the spirit is
[36:21] love joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[36:26] goodness faith
[36:28] meekness Temperance and against such
[36:30] there is no law and they that are that
[36:33] are Christ have crucified the F has
[36:37] crucified the flesh with the affections
[36:39] of lust see all of those things you're
[36:41] supposed to have as God is in you and
[36:44] they should be coming out of you that
[36:46] people can say you have a good character
[36:48] they can say it about you you might not
[36:50] have spoke a word but they know hey
[36:52] that's a good person that's a
[36:54] God-fearing person but you didn't say
[36:56] nothing to them maybe they just saw you
[36:58] pray over your
[36:59] food and they knew that you had a
[37:01] relationship with God they might not
[37:04] have seen you do nothing else but that
[37:05] was different to them CU there are some
[37:08] people that still haven't seen that they
[37:10] didn't grow up in a home where they saw
[37:11] that every day they they didn't grow up
[37:14] and go to school and they seen that
[37:15] every day where this person was the same
[37:18] person each and every day they came to
[37:20] school there was no differences when
[37:22] they came see sometimes we get and
[37:25] things do affect you life will affect
[37:28] you and sometimes you have to go to God
[37:30] and say Lord take this from me say
[37:33] sometimes I can remember in my own life
[37:35] where you struggle with maybe things
[37:36] that go against you you might have anger
[37:39] issues and you have to go to God and say
[37:41] Lord take this from me because I can't
[37:43] afford for this thing that to mess with
[37:46] the rest of my life you have to go to
[37:48] God and say and sometimes you got to
[37:50] spend time with God it ain't just coming
[37:52] to God and expecting it to happen you
[37:54] got to go over and over cuz that thing
[37:56] can come back on you brother Rand said
[37:59] if the devil he finds a spot that's
[38:01] that's your weak spot he got a right to
[38:03] come back to it so you got to be aware
[38:06] of that and go to God and say Lord I
[38:08] still need you to cover me even when I
[38:10] think I'm strong I got to get back down
[38:12] and say Lord I'm not as strong as I
[38:14] think I Am Lord I need your help and
[38:18] sometimes you might not even realize it
[38:20] until things start happening after you
[38:22] done the devil the wolf done got behind
[38:25] your enclosure and you ain't even realiz
[38:27] it cuz it looked like it was
[38:29] white but the wolf got back there the
[38:32] only way you knew is your sheep started
[38:34] dying and you was trying to figure out I
[38:36] closed the gate I thought it was all
[38:39] covered but it was a wolf in there and
[38:42] sometimes you got to find a way to get
[38:43] that wolf out but you know the best way
[38:45] to do is go to God and say Lord I don't
[38:47] know how it got in but Lord I need you
[38:50] to take it out I don't know how it might
[38:52] have entered but Lord I need you to come
[38:54] before me and take it out whether it's a
[38:57] bad attitude sometimes and sometimes you
[39:00] might not realize that you have one
[39:02] until other people tell you they telling
[39:05] you because they care about you and
[39:07] sometimes they might not even care but
[39:09] it don't mean that you shouldn't get rid
[39:10] of
[39:11] it they it doesn't mean cuz your enemy
[39:14] can tell you something and be like that
[39:16] that's getting on my nerves doesn't mean
[39:17] they wasn't right doesn't mean that they
[39:20] wasn't telling you there was something
[39:22] in your character that you needed to fix
[39:24] it was something in your character that
[39:26] you needed to get before God and said
[39:28] Lord change this because I realize it's
[39:31] not what what you said it was supposed
[39:33] to be it's not one of these fruits of
[39:36] the spirit that's coming out of me so if
[39:38] it's not it's not one of those it's not
[39:40] of you so Lord if I want to make it in I
[39:43] want everything that's not like you you
[39:45] take it out of me Lord everything that's
[39:48] not like you Lord remove it because I
[39:50] don't want that to be the hindrance just
[39:53] imagine you did everything right and the
[39:55] Lord turned you around and say you know
[39:57] what you had an anger issue you can't
[39:59] get in
[40:01] heaven just imagine you get to heaven
[40:03] and the Lord say you had a lion issue
[40:06] you can't come into heaven that was the
[40:08] thing that stopped you you might have
[40:10] thought about man I got this I got that
[40:12] and all these other things and and what
[40:14] if that's the thing that stops you what
[40:17] if you got to think of just taking that
[40:19] that few little dollars that you know
[40:20] somebody dropped on the ground but you
[40:22] saw when they dropped
[40:24] it what if that's the thing that stops
[40:27] you from going to
[40:28] heaven said what what do you think when
[40:32] people say about you do you care cuz
[40:34] many of times somebody might tell you
[40:36] something you be like I don't
[40:38] care but they are trying to help you
[40:40] sometimes and sometime God send that to
[40:43] you say hey let me get your attention
[40:46] because obviously you can't see it
[40:48] yourself so I got to send somebody to
[40:51] tell you what it is I got to send
[40:53] somebody to tell you what it is but bam
[40:56] he used the Donkey
[40:58] it had got so to a point of desperation
[41:01] that bam had removed everyone from
[41:03] around him he was by himself but he
[41:06] didn't realize that God could use the
[41:08] donkey he didn't realize after all the
[41:10] people was gone God still had a way to
[41:13] speak to him and when if you are his son
[41:16] and daughter God will speak to you by
[41:18] any means necessary God has a way of
[41:21] getting your attention God has a way of
[41:23] coming down to you and speak directly to
[41:25] you that you know is God
[41:27] that you know it ain't nobody else could
[41:29] know but God and when he speaks to you
[41:32] you know that something got to change
[41:35] and if you really want to God see it you
[41:36] want it to change you don't just you
[41:39] don't just want have it to happen to you
[41:41] you want it to change and whatever it's
[41:43] necessary for it to change you start
[41:45] working on it you start working on it it
[41:48] might not happen overnight but I tell
[41:50] you if you look back in the year you say
[41:52] I what I wanted to read something that
[41:55] said said
[41:58] a lady had a testimony and she said you
[42:00] know I ain't what I ought to be and she
[42:02] said I ain't what I what I want to be
[42:04] but she said one thing I'm sure I ain't
[42:07] what I used to be see sometimes you also
[42:09] want to have that testimony Lord I ain't
[42:12] where I want to be I might not be where
[42:13] I should be but Lord I ain't where I
[42:15] used to be so you got to have a growth
[42:18] you plant something in the ground and
[42:20] you don't see it grow you dig it up and
[42:22] you throw it away but you don't want God
[42:24] to do that to you God don't he gave you
[42:27] so much so that you can give it back to
[42:29] them at some point in time there has to
[42:31] be fruits for the labor at some point in
[42:34] time otherwise it's a wasted effort you
[42:36] can turn around and say why did I do
[42:38] that it was a waste of my time and
[42:40] energy if you do it over and over they
[42:43] said the the definition of insanity is
[42:45] doing something over and over and
[42:47] expecting a different result and
[42:49] sometimes we get to doing something we
[42:51] doing something and we think that we're
[42:52] doing it for a profit but it's not
[42:54] that's right we think that we doing
[42:56] something but Ain no fruits of it the
[42:59] Bible says when Jesus passed the pig
[43:00] tree and he came back and there's no
[43:02] fruit and he said he said basically cut
[43:04] it down to paraphrase it and get rid of
[43:07] the tree cuz the the tree is no good you
[43:10] want something that's living you want
[43:12] something that's growing you want
[43:14] something that Lord when people look at
[43:15] me I have the right reputation when
[43:18] people talk about me they have good
[43:20] things to say cuz it's nothing like I I
[43:23] used to say I said you know a good word
[43:25] might spread might spread to about five
[43:27] or 10 people but a bad word are sure
[43:30] multiply a bad word just one word that's
[43:34] ill will even if it's a lie on you will
[43:36] spread quicker than the
[43:38] truth and sometimes you have to some
[43:41] people don't give you the benefit of the
[43:42] doubt they don't give you a second
[43:45] chance but I know a God that always
[43:47] gives you second chances I know a God
[43:50] that said come to me all ye to heavy
[43:52] laden and heavy burden and I'll give you
[43:54] rest he said I'll take all your yolks
[43:56] and put on me and and he will take give
[43:59] you rest for your
[44:01] soul said that's what God wants to give
[44:04] you but it's asking the question do you
[44:06] want it it's a certain point for God to
[44:09] want to give it to you cuz he already
[44:11] gave it to you it's a gift but do you
[44:13] want it do you want it now there are
[44:16] things that you got to do to get it but
[44:19] it ain't nothing more than anything you
[44:21] can get out here it ain't nothing more
[44:23] than than just being good being a good
[44:26] person and doing these things that's
[44:27] what God asked you to do and just give
[44:30] your life to him that's what he wants
[44:32] that's all that he asked you for he
[44:34] didn't ask for everything else he said I
[44:36] can give you everything else but he just
[44:38] wants your life he wants you to say Lord
[44:41] I'm sold out to you and everything that
[44:44] I'm do I'm sold out to you Lord I want
[44:46] to see your glory working in my life
[44:49] Lord I want to see your your Holy Spirit
[44:51] coming out of my life Lord I want to see
[44:54] your love your joy your peace your
[44:57] longsuffering your kindness says
[45:00] sometimes you see a lot of people they
[45:01] aren't kind they only care about
[45:04] themselves and they and they treat
[45:06] everyone around them just like that I've
[45:09] seen it when working with different
[45:11] things and even going to school I said
[45:13] told someone recently said I have
[45:15] learned that I don't like working in
[45:17] groups
[45:18] anymore I have learned that but it's not
[45:21] because of the work it's because of the
[45:23] people that you're dealing with and
[45:26] sometimes you don't realize the
[45:27] difference with dealing with people that
[45:29] have some type of character or standard
[45:31] versus not that's right it's not until
[45:34] you are exposed to that to realize that
[45:36] some people really don't care and and
[45:39] only that they only care about
[45:41] themselves and then they don't take it
[45:44] personal you over there hurt broken up
[45:48] oh Lord what am I doing and they going
[45:50] about their life and you don't even
[45:53] realize it and sometime God allows these
[45:56] things to be test for you he allows
[45:59] these things to be a trial for you
[46:01] because he said I'm trying to show you
[46:03] something I'm trying to show you there's
[46:05] still a work to be done in your life
[46:07] even though you might have thought you
[46:09] was on this level let me show you where
[46:10] you really are they let me show you
[46:13] exactly so you can look in the mirror
[46:15] and see yourself say sometimes when
[46:18] you're going through certain things you
[46:19] don't want to see the mirror that's
[46:20] right you want to walk past it real
[46:22] quick or you don't want to be in a room
[46:24] with the mirror because you don't want
[46:26] to see yourself
[46:27] yourself because you know if you saw
[46:29] yourself you would do something about it
[46:32] you know if you saw yourself and really
[46:34] had a conversation where you sat down
[46:36] and stopped for one moment you aren't
[46:39] busy for one moment things would change
[46:43] because you would have to be honest with
[46:45] yourself but nobody can be honest with
[46:47] you more than you can be honest with
[46:49] yourself God can you can be walking into
[46:52] a brick wall over and over but until you
[46:55] realize you know what this is not a
[46:56] great way to do this to get over this
[47:00] wall walking straight into it you're not
[47:02] going to change what you're doing cuz
[47:04] sometimes you can also Bible say in the
[47:07] last times the Lord would give them over
[47:10] to a rep probate mind they might start
[47:12] believe in what they what they have in
[47:14] their mind and say Lord I don't ever
[47:16] want to get to that point see there's a
[47:19] point in time that you don't want to
[47:20] cross over to that to that level see God
[47:23] has a way that he but if you have God's
[47:26] character in you he'll lead you to the
[47:28] right things he'll lead you to the right
[47:30] truth he'll lead you and that he'll
[47:32] guide you each and every day each and
[47:34] every day that you wake up and you don't
[47:36] have Direction you can say Lord give me
[47:38] a direction today Lord lead me to what
[47:41] you want me to do Lord guide me into
[47:44] what you want me to do said you might
[47:46] not know where things are going but God
[47:48] always know you might not know that this
[47:51] is just a test to get you to where you
[47:54] can be
[47:55] blessed you might not know that this
[47:57] test is just to get you to where you can
[47:59] be blessed I said you might not know
[48:02] that this is just a test that God to get
[48:05] you to where you can be blessed see God
[48:08] has to sometimes work on you to give you
[48:11] what you asked him for I said I remember
[48:14] I said you know what we get this
[48:16] wonderful packages sometimes where
[48:19] there's blessing but you didn't see the
[48:20] trials to come with
[48:22] it you asked God for it and God gave it
[48:24] to you but you didn't see all the trials
[48:26] that was wrapped up in
[48:28] it I said you didn't see all the test
[48:31] that you was going to have to go through
[48:32] when you got that blessing am but it was
[48:35] something that God was contined to lift
[48:36] you up God was continue to say I gave
[48:39] you this so that you can thank me but
[48:42] also I want to work on you I gave you
[48:45] this so that you can be blessed and I
[48:47] can show forth that I am God but I also
[48:50] want to teach you a lesson I also want
[48:52] you to remember that even though you are
[48:54] blessed I'm still God and I deserve the
[48:57] honor and I deserve the praise and I
[49:00] deserve everything that I gave you and
[49:02] so much more I just ask that you praise
[49:05] me I just ask you give your life to me
[49:08] is that too much amen when he said I own
[49:11] all the cattle of thousand heels and he
[49:14] can give it to you all you had to do was
[49:16] ask amen so sometimes you don't have
[49:19] because you don't ask and I said God has
[49:21] a way to building your character that
[49:24] you can't even understand sometimes amen
[49:27] you think that but always remember in
[49:29] the word he said I never put more on you
[49:31] than you can bear but God has a way of
[49:34] building your character that you don't
[49:36] understand sometimes you know I realized
[49:39] something the other day something
[49:40] happened in my life and you know I I
[49:43] thought so many different things and I
[49:45] realized that I just found out some
[49:48] information that made me change my
[49:50] opinion on the whole
[49:52] situation but it took me six months to a
[49:54] year to find out that information and I
[49:57] thought about it in myself what if I had
[49:59] had the right Outlook from the beginning
[50:02] I wouldn't have spent hours and days and
[50:04] time trying to figure out what went
[50:06] wrong I want to spend hours and days and
[50:08] time trying to figure out what I did and
[50:11] how this happened and if this could have
[50:13] happened if that could have happened if
[50:14] I would have said Lord you know what I
[50:17] trust you and just go on from it am I
[50:20] could have been a whole lot further up
[50:22] the road in life but you don't realize
[50:25] how much time you sp spend it when
[50:27] you're going through it you don't
[50:29] realize when you look back over your
[50:31] when you look back you see they say
[50:33] hindsight is 220 but sometimes you got
[50:36] to take that time and say Lord you know
[50:38] what I can spend time complaining I can
[50:41] spend time thinking I can spend time
[50:43] trying to figure it out or I can just go
[50:45] to you and ask you and I can shortcut
[50:49] all that time and sometime God will tell
[50:51] you and sometimes he said wait and
[50:53] sometimes he say that ain't you don't
[50:54] need to worry about it cuz that's what
[50:57] God
[50:58] does because he's God and see when he
[51:01] has that character in you you respond in
[51:03] the right
[51:04] way when the tests and Trials come come
[51:07] at you you can respond in the right way
[51:09] see Jesus that was his main key he
[51:12] always responded in the right way that's
[51:14] how he defeated every devil because he
[51:16] always responded in the right way and
[51:19] said no matter what was coming against
[51:21] him he always responded in the right way
[51:24] now the question is do you
[51:27] see God is in you if he's if you want of
[51:30] his child and he's giving you the holy
[51:32] ghost that that God is he's in you he's
[51:35] giv you the ability to respond the right
[51:37] way 100% of the time not not 95 not 85
[51:42] but 100% of the time because he's inside
[51:44] of you and God is Holy and he's perfect
[51:47] and that's what he requires of you cuz
[51:49] he said it in his word said that Lord I
[51:52] want your character to be built in me
[51:55] Lord each and every day if I got to die
[51:58] out like Paul said I Die daily there's a
[52:01] reason why Paul had to die you think
[52:03] about how great Paul was and how much he
[52:06] did and how intelligent he was and he
[52:09] said I count it all not I count all the
[52:12] things that I've accomplished to be no
[52:14] gain but he said but Paul was realizing
[52:18] that it's only by the grace of God I am
[52:21] where I am it's only by the grace of God
[52:24] and his mercy and him coming down and
[52:26] touching my life one day and putting his
[52:29] character in me that I am who I am
[52:32] because otherwise I seen who I was I
[52:35] seen what I was capable of but I also
[52:37] seen when God changed me he put his
[52:40] spirit in me I seen how different it was
[52:43] I seen the character that God placed in
[52:45] me and realizing there was nothing I
[52:47] could do to get that character God had
[52:50] to give it to me but I had to go to him
[52:52] and Paul had to get silent and get with
[52:55] God to get it Paul had to find out and
[52:57] be you don't want to get to the place
[52:59] where God had to Blind you to give you
[53:02] something that's what he had to do to
[53:04] Paul he had to Blind him and God just
[53:07] allowed him to have his sight back but
[53:09] God could have kept it he could have
[53:12] kept it but he didn't cuz he had a work
[53:13] for Paul to do he had something that he
[53:16] wanted Paul to do you don't want God to
[53:18] come down and take you down to your last
[53:21] to realize Lord I need to give my life
[53:23] to you Lord I need your character inside
[53:26] of me cuz Lord I want to make it Lord I
[53:29] want to make it in and if you don't want
[53:31] God to say you know what this the only
[53:33] way you going to make it is I got to put
[53:35] you all the way down so that you can
[53:37] make
[53:38] it but God will do it if you his child
[53:42] God will do it if you his child
[53:44] sometimes because he got to show you you
[53:46] know you might think that you're strong
[53:48] maybe that's your
[53:50] thing some people might have trials and
[53:53] tests and anger and this but maybe you
[53:55] think that you you always strong that
[53:58] you don't need no help that you don't
[54:01] need God sometimes because you I can do
[54:03] it I can do it but God trying to show
[54:05] you sometime listen I can bring you down
[54:08] to where you can't do
[54:10] it to put your put his character in you
[54:13] to all you can do is lift your eyes up
[54:15] to the heels and say Lord I need your
[54:17] help that's all you can do but God gives
[54:20] you life health and strength each and
[54:22] every day so that you can make that
[54:24] choice don't wait till you get there
[54:27] some people don't get the opportunity to
[54:28] come to their last moment to say Lord I
[54:31] give my life to
[54:33] you life is so short sometimes you got
[54:37] to have this character before you get
[54:39] there you got to have this character
[54:41] inside of you before you get there but
[54:43] the only way to get it is to get God
[54:45] inside of you the only way to get it is
[54:47] to get him inside of you and sometimes
[54:50] that say you dying out to everything you
[54:54] got to let everything go you got to get
[54:57] down and say Lord I I can't do this no
[54:59] more you got to get to that point the
[55:02] prophet God spoke a message on
[55:03] desperation you got to get desperate
[55:05] sometimes and life might be up and down
[55:08] and have so much on you but sometimes
[55:10] you got to go to God In Prayer by
[55:12] yourself you can't wait for nobody else
[55:14] to get get with you to pray with you you
[55:16] got to go to God by yourself and you got
[55:19] to say Lord I need something I need
[55:23] something to take these burdens off of
[55:25] me to take these weights off of me Lord
[55:28] and have your character so I can respond
[55:30] the right way Lord that I can maintain
[55:33] the right Integrity that I can continue
[55:35] to grow and continue to build on Lord
[55:37] the work that you're doing in my life
[55:39] say you want to have the right
[55:41] reputation and the way to have it is to
[55:44] have God inside of you that even when
[55:46] your enemies talk about you they can't
[55:48] say nothing but good things that's what
[55:50] happened when balum got on top of that
[55:52] mountain and he started to curse it was
[55:55] nothing but blessings
[55:56] because they had God on their side much
[55:59] more if you have them inside of you they
[56:01] just had him beside them he can be
[56:03] inside of you he can live that they
[56:06] can't say anything but good things about
[56:08] you because that's who God is he is
[56:10] nothing but good and so God God he's
[56:14] able to build and put that character
[56:15] into you that you can overcome that you
[56:18] can get over everything that may come
[56:21] against you in your life so that you can
[56:24] maintain the right integrity
[56:27] [Applause]
[56:47] amen and cap praise
[56:51] Lord
[56:53] am character amen you know I was
[56:56] thinking as brother Kell was preaching
[56:58] tonight it was somebody I told him a
[57:00] while back I was telling him I was like
[57:02] you know cuz sometimes people do have
[57:05] that attitude I don't care what they
[57:06] think I don't care what people say it
[57:08] ain't I ain't let people think what they
[57:10] think I says even if you ain't uh doing
[57:14] certain things wrong sometimes it's the
[57:16] way it
[57:17] looks the Bible says the obstain from
[57:20] the very appearance of
[57:21] evil so it ain't I don't care you ought
[57:25] to care how people view
[57:27] you amen you ought to care how people
[57:30] view you and when they see you brother
[57:33] was saying tonight you want people to
[57:34] say that's a Christian right there just
[57:37] by your life you don't have to you know
[57:40] I learned that early in Christian
[57:43] Journey you know you can Proclaim it
[57:45] from The Mountaintop but your life
[57:47] speaks louder than what you say the very
[57:50] life that you that you uh live right and
[57:54] sometimes me and my wife was saying the
[57:56] other night she was telling me something
[57:58] that she heard a a preacher say and and
[58:01] she said she looked at them different
[58:03] from that point cuz it should have never
[58:06] came out of their
[58:07] mouth and that's the truth you know
[58:11] sometimes we can say things that damage
[58:13] our
[58:14] whole the way people out look at you
[58:17] come on especially in the ministry
[58:20] that's why you always pray and ask God
[58:22] to guide your thoughts guide your mouth
[58:25] sometimes we speak speak real fast but
[58:27] you got to think about what you getting
[58:28] ready to say you know I was sitting
[58:31] there praying tonight before I came here
[58:33] and and I was praying on you know on
[58:36] myself really and I I just say Lord you
[58:38] know I I want to trust you in every
[58:41] situation am every situation in this
[58:44] life Lord I want to trust you it's so
[58:47] easy to get our minds focused on other
[58:50] things and we miss out on the
[58:52] Lord I say what is it profit a man to
[58:55] gain the whole world
[58:56] the brother Caleb said you know you get
[58:58] up to the gate and the Lord said I ain't
[59:00] going to let you in because of you know
[59:02] just saying it that way but and that's
[59:05] the truth you got to work on
[59:08] yourself you got to search out your own
[59:10] soul our eyes so fixed on everybody
[59:14] else and you can pray for we pray for
[59:17] everybody but have you looked in the
[59:19] mirror
[59:20] lately you know I I thought about
[59:23] something else when he was preaching T
[59:24] night when he was talking about looking
[59:25] in the mirror I remember when the Lord
[59:28] for before I got saved and I came home
[59:31] and one night I was thinking you know
[59:33] I'm still cool and hip cuz you know
[59:38] hanging out and my mama she had a way of
[59:41] talking to me she says cuz I was you
[59:46] know wasn't in my right mind at the time
[59:49] but she says I want you to go look at
[59:51] yourself in the
[59:52] mirror she said go I want you to go
[59:55] right there and look at look at just
[59:56] look at how you
[59:58] look and I went and I looked in the
[1:00:01] mirror and I bust out
[1:00:03] crying I didn't know I looked it that
[1:00:06] bad I thought I was still cool and
[1:00:09] something he had on a dirty shirt dirty
[1:00:13] jeans have hanging off you looking in
[1:00:16] bad
[1:00:17] shape but the Lord allowed me to see
[1:00:20] what I look
[1:00:22] like and I'm so glad that one day he
[1:00:24] allowed me to look in the word and see
[1:00:26] what I look like how naked wretched and
[1:00:29] miserable I was and it hum it humbled
[1:00:33] you in such a way that you know your
[1:00:35] whole life all you want to do now is
[1:00:38] just be pleasing to God everything God
[1:00:40] bless you with you think God for all the
[1:00:42] blessings but the main goal is to make
[1:00:45] Heaven my home the Rapture to make it in
[1:00:50] cuz you don't want to be down here come
[1:00:52] on so you always you press to go to
[1:00:55] extra mile extra distance you worry you
[1:00:58] wor about how people view you because
[1:01:00] you want your voice to count especially
[1:01:03] in the ministry you want your voice to
[1:01:05] count you lose that voice and then you
[1:01:08] how you going to help people and that's
[1:01:10] just not just saying in church your
[1:01:12] voice got to count on a job your voice
[1:01:13] got to count everywhere you go that
[1:01:17] people can depend on you I remember uh
[1:01:20] several times even here now uh at work
[1:01:24] people ask you to pray for them because
[1:01:26] they got confidence in you you know how
[1:01:28] much that confidence would drop if they
[1:01:29] hear me say something or or or do
[1:01:33] something you know how much of that
[1:01:34] conference they would lose so it's it's
[1:01:38] a standard that you that you got to live
[1:01:41] by come on not only is the people
[1:01:44] watching but you know the main one God
[1:01:45] Is Watching and you don't want God to
[1:01:48] take his holy spirit away from you
[1:01:51] sometimes people can say stuff or say
[1:01:53] something and it don't bother them but
[1:01:56] the moment it come out your mouth
[1:01:57] conviction
[1:01:58] Falls you know I've had that happen you
[1:02:02] know just talking randomly and I had to
[1:02:05] go get in the car and pray immediately I
[1:02:09] didn't it didn't somebody said what did
[1:02:11] you say wasen nothing bad the Holy Ghost
[1:02:14] it convicted you you didn't say that
[1:02:17] right and the one thing you you dread
[1:02:20] God Don't Take Your Presence away from
[1:02:22] me you know if God difference between
[1:02:26] you and the next man and God take his
[1:02:27] presence off of you come on the only
[1:02:30] only reason why uhuh the devil ain't
[1:02:33] having his way with you is because God's
[1:02:35] got a hedge around you that's the only
[1:02:37] that's the only reason why God is
[1:02:39] protecting you not because of the good
[1:02:42] youve done or what family you in God's
[1:02:44] got a hedge about you come on and if he
[1:02:48] was to remove that oh you the devil have
[1:02:51] his way with you come on but we thank
[1:02:54] God and that's why we always want want
[1:02:55] to walk with that and always want to
[1:02:58] keep God in our midst come on and it's
[1:03:01] like he say it's a character building
[1:03:02] process I was I was sharing I'll say
[1:03:04] this I sit down I was sharing with the
[1:03:07] church on Sunday a little um something I
[1:03:10] was hearing this this guy explained
[1:03:14] about how you know the Horseshoe how
[1:03:18] they take the the Horseshoe is one
[1:03:20] entity and the fire is another one but
[1:03:23] they take the Horseshoe for it uh
[1:03:26] perfected they take it and they put it
[1:03:28] in the fire you know and they keep
[1:03:30] beating on it and they keep beating on
[1:03:32] it they says but the longer you leave it
[1:03:34] in that fire now they're no longer the
[1:03:38] two entities I guess what he was saying
[1:03:40] but they're one you could say that now
[1:03:43] you know the fire is in the Horseshoe
[1:03:46] because the Horseshoe
[1:03:48] absorbed the fire so now they're no
[1:03:52] longer two but the fire is still there
[1:03:54] but now is in the horses shhoo and I was
[1:03:58] thinking how God does in our lives come
[1:04:02] on and I said Lord that's what I
[1:04:05] want God I want to be so you know was
[1:04:10] saying gold tried in fire but I want to
[1:04:12] be so that Lord when the people see me
[1:04:17] somebody told me once Ernest you got a a
[1:04:20] glow on your face but I want somebody
[1:04:23] when when people see you they say the
[1:04:26] fire is in there the fire is in brother
[1:04:29] Ernest the fire is in him you know I got
[1:04:33] you see no the fire is there but he's
[1:04:36] been in it so long that he's been
[1:04:38] absorbed by it ain't that what you want
[1:04:40] tonight to be in the presence of God to
[1:04:44] where he just absorbs you but it takes
[1:04:47] you allowing God you know when David
[1:04:49] asked God to search him and try him he
[1:04:52] didn't he didn't hold withhold nothing
[1:04:54] back from the Lord I don't believe
[1:04:56] but he wanted to be right search my
[1:04:59] heart try my Reigns show me where I'm
[1:05:02] wrong at God and not only will you show
[1:05:04] me where I'm wrong but give me the
[1:05:07] courage come
[1:05:09] on the courage and the faith to make it
[1:05:14] right because sometimes God will show
[1:05:17] you wrong but you don't have the courage
[1:05:19] to go back and say I was wrong to make
[1:05:21] it right to repent you don't have the
[1:05:25] courage to do that but I pray God not
[1:05:28] only show me my faults but give me the
[1:05:30] courage help me to be real and honest
[1:05:34] when I stand before you God is that what
[1:05:37] you want tonight come on I believe the
[1:05:39] true character of God can lie in that
[1:05:41] was so many things that was said tonight
[1:05:44] but if you you you got to take it come
[1:05:46] on how many has that attitude sometime I
[1:05:49] don't care what people think come on
[1:05:51] Jesus cared about everything didn't he
[1:05:54] it matters amen
[1:05:57] [Applause]

[1:06:09] the word thank God for each and everyone
