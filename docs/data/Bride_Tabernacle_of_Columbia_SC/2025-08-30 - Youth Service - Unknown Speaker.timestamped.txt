[37:04] it for her. Hey, God. Any who all know
[37:07] me in here? I'm Sister Nene.
[37:11] Um y'all back
[37:14] yesterday made a year last year I was we
[37:19] were having our big corporate meeting
[37:21] for my job and um well I I was coming to
[37:25] church been coming to church 31 years
[37:28] but sometimes you know you don't be
[37:30] walking circumspectingly sometimes and
[37:32] and that don't do you no good. But
[37:35] anyway y'all, we were having our
[37:36] corporate meeting at the um
[37:40] SIMT building in Florence and we was at
[37:43] the auditorium and so
[37:47] dress the dress I had on wasn't quite
[37:50] too good but God had he warned me. He
[37:54] had warned me over and over. But y'all,
[37:56] there's a guy that worked with me and
[37:58] y'all he is HIV positive and um but that
[38:03] don't mean anything. You know, we you
[38:06] know that's your coworker whatever. But
[38:09] anyway, and I work in the medical field.
[38:11] So I walked in the auditorium y'all, but
[38:14] I had saw him and I seen a a demon. I
[38:17] did and I said that don't look right. He
[38:20] wasn't moving right. And so y'all, I
[38:22] walked in the auditorium
[38:25] and he was talking to another man. It's
[38:27] kind of dark in there. And I threw up my
[38:30] hand like that and waved and y'all, he
[38:34] stuck me in my arm with something. He
[38:38] stuck me, y'all. My whole left arm was
[38:40] in pain. I waved this one. I don't know
[38:43] what happened with this one, but he
[38:44] stuck me y'all. That's all I y'all.
[38:47] Okay. I've been in medical field about
[38:49] 25 years. I know what to do. My boss is
[38:52] a doctor. My I got a panel of nurses in
[38:55] nurse practitioners all around me. I
[38:57] know what to do. I knew what to do. I
[39:01] did nothing. I did nothing, y'all.
[39:04] Nothing. Okay. So,
[39:08] about two weeks passed. Two weeks,
[39:10] y'all. I was supposed to leave there, go
[39:13] straight to the hospital and get prep,
[39:16] get the medicine to come back if
[39:19] anything was transmitted. And um I did
[39:22] nothing.
[39:24] Two weeks passed, I got sick. I got
[39:28] sick. My appetite was gone.
[39:31] Um
[39:33] I felt very nauseous,
[39:36] y'all. It's like something even happened
[39:39] with my eyesight.
[39:41] Um, I mean, a lot of things I couldn't
[39:44] even So, what I did, y'all, I text about
[39:48] 20 sisters and I was like, "Y'all pray
[39:51] for me. This this this this is deep.
[39:53] This something." And um, y'all, when I
[39:57] tell y'all, and guess what? He was the
[40:01] man that if a patient come in and get
[40:03] tested for HIV and they found to be
[40:06] positive, you have to call him so he can
[40:09] come and do the work up. You know what
[40:10] I'm saying? If y'all anybody in here
[40:12] know about nurses, any doctors in here
[40:14] or whatever. He was the guy. So if I
[40:19] needed to I didn't get a HIV test done
[40:21] at my job because I was like, "Oh no, if
[40:23] he gave me HIV, um, he ain't seeing me."
[40:27] Uh-uh. I do the eye exams at my job.
[40:30] Well, my pre, it's not my job anymore. I
[40:31] just got a brand new job with a bigger
[40:33] corporation. And so, um, but anyway, I
[40:36] had done that job almost 3 years. And
[40:40] so, um,
[40:42] I'm like, "No." And, um, so finally I
[40:46] talked to one of the nurse
[40:47] practitioners. She said, "Why you ain't
[40:48] tell?" I talked to my boss and nurse.
[40:50] "Why you ain't tell?" I talked the the
[40:52] big supervisor over me, a doctor. Why?
[40:54] Why you ain't say nothing? So, they had
[40:55] to have this big meeting and um finally
[40:58] I went to the health department, y'all,
[41:01] and got tested and they told me say, "We
[41:04] going to do a fast track on you." Man,
[41:07] that was no fast track. That thing took
[41:09] almost two weeks to come back.
[41:11] But anyway, it came back nonreactive. If
[41:14] anybody in here in the medical field
[41:16] know what that mean, that means
[41:17] negative. But anyway, y'all, what I
[41:21] wanted to say was
[41:23] my prayers
[41:25] for two weeks turned into all night
[41:28] prayers. All night. And I had to get up
[41:31] at 5:00 in the morning, go to work, but
[41:34] they turned into all night prayers and
[41:37] fasting and seeking the Lord. Like
[41:39] brother Brooke said last night or well
[41:42] not before last, sorry. when I David the
[41:45] prophet said when I was seeking the Lord
[41:48] and um
[41:51] it ch it was God it was God changed me I
[41:56] y'all I was in such a bad state mentally
[42:00] my daughter told me y'all I live with
[42:02] her she said I'm going to leave my house
[42:04] I'm going to leave you in the house and
[42:05] me too going to move out because I was
[42:08] so depressed
[42:10] I was I was messed up I mean I went to
[42:13] my My pastor was in the hospital and I
[42:16] had to go up there and tell my pastor
[42:18] what happened. I called brother Simmons
[42:20] and sister Renee. I had to I had y'all I
[42:22] had to have a panel. I had to have God
[42:25] cuz let me tell you when when God come
[42:28] and and let me say it like I want to say
[42:30] it. When he bust you up, let me tell
[42:33] you, the devil can't bust you up like
[42:34] God can bust you up. And so, um, they
[42:38] was praying for me, praying everybody.
[42:41] And God delivered me. And one night, my
[42:44] my baby daughter, Malaysia, y'all know
[42:46] her. She stayed down the street from us
[42:49] in a townhouse. And she said, "I think a
[42:52] rat got in the house and I can't stay
[42:54] there." And I'm like, "Girl, ain't no
[42:56] rat in that house. That house, I almost
[42:57] knew how a rat get in that house." And I
[43:00] was just praying all night, y'all.
[43:02] Reading my Bible all night, praying,
[43:03] praising her. And she said, "What?" She
[43:06] asked my oldest daughter, "What's going
[43:07] on with my mama?" And she said, "The
[43:09] spirit of the Lord had told her
[43:11] something about HIV." And she said,
[43:13] "Mama, what are what's going on?"
[43:16] And y'all know my husband passed away
[43:18] about four years ago. So, ain't nothing
[43:21] going on here. So, you know, and um
[43:25] she said, "Mama, no." She said, "What
[43:28] what's going on? You supposed to be
[43:30] Christian. You supposed to be a prayer
[43:31] boy. You supposed to be believing. Why
[43:32] are you going through like this? I said,
[43:35] Lia, I had to be honest. I had to
[43:37] confess. I said, I wasn't quite walking
[43:40] circumspectly. No, I don't deal with,
[43:42] you know,
[43:44] sexual activity. No, but I I wasn't
[43:46] walking right in my dressing and
[43:48] different things like that. She said,
[43:50] "But mama, that ain't even symptoms what
[43:52] you have." And I said, "Let me tell you
[43:53] something. I've been in the medical
[43:54] field at that time, 24 years." I said,
[43:56] "You ain't going to tell me." Yes, I
[43:58] Yes, I am. I guess I um I know that was
[44:00] symptoms, but y'all the panel was
[44:02] praying for me, the saints of God. And I
[44:06] was praying my whole life totally
[44:08] changed, right? It changed, right? You
[44:12] can go to church. That don't mean you
[44:14] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost.
[44:16] But um it was negative, y'all. And I
[44:21] found out I had fibroids
[44:23] on my uterus and I had to have surgery
[44:26] this year. I had surgery in January and
[44:29] um of course I had to get tested
[44:31] different tests all over again negative
[44:33] or non-reactive as y'all know of um
[44:36] praise the Lord and I stand here before
[44:39] you as sister Nini Tanil that's my real
[44:42] name I'm Holy Ghost filing and I just
[44:44] want to say
[44:47] don't let God bust you up if you ain't
[44:50] been busted up cuz he will and you will
[44:53] forever be changed or you'll be just
[44:57] don't you just don't want God to be cast
[44:59] into out of darkness. But that's my full
[45:01] testimony cuz I know a lot of people
[45:03] always wondered what went on with me. So
[45:06] that's it. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[45:09] [Music]
[45:11] [Applause]
[45:14] [Music]
[45:17] Bless.
[45:19] [Music]
[45:27] Okay.
[45:29] Um
[45:35] [Music]
[45:52] I kept telling them I was like, "Guys,
[45:54] every time I think about it,
[45:58] I just start crying."
[46:01] [Music]
[46:06] &gt;&gt; But my testimony is about mental health.
[46:11] You know, you hear
[46:14] you hear all these testimonies about um
[46:18] people getting healed from the actions
[46:21] that they do. You know, maybe you're in
[46:24] the world and you're not living right or
[46:28] you got you got um hurt and God healed
[46:32] you.
[46:34] But
[46:37] I was kind of confused about my
[46:39] testimony because it didn't come from
[46:42] that angle.
[46:44] Mine was in my head. Mine was mental. It
[46:49] was the thoughts that I that I had.
[46:55] But um
[46:57] then you know
[47:00] um
[47:01] Josh asked if anybody had a testimony
[47:03] and I had text him. I was I was really
[47:06] scared and I had text. I was like yeah I
[47:08] have one.
[47:11] So
[47:13] for
[47:15] for years,
[47:17] you know, low self-esteem is a is a
[47:20] demon.
[47:22] It's it's really hard to have and I
[47:27] struggle with it.
[47:29] Not physically,
[47:31] not cuz how I looked,
[47:34] but cuz what I how thought or how strong
[47:38] I
[47:40] or how weak I thought I was.
[47:44] If you think you're not enough
[47:47] physically,
[47:49] put that in the context of you're not
[47:52] enough for God.
[47:55] For years,
[47:58] for years, I thought,
[48:01] why would God want me?
[48:04] You know, you hear that saying of um
[48:08] even the weakest Christian can um
[48:12] um or the devil's scared of even the
[48:15] weakest Christian. I was already
[48:18] claiming that as myself. I was like,
[48:20] "Oh, that's me. I'm the weakest way
[48:22] here." when um when I would see people
[48:27] raise their hands and and shout and cry
[48:31] out, you know, I would be sitting or
[48:34] standing and I would feel something in
[48:36] my chest and I'm like,
[48:40] well, why aren't I doing that? You know,
[48:43] you know, why isn't God touching me? And
[48:46] then, you know, as you grow up, as you
[48:49] grow up as
[48:51] um people already in the church, you
[48:55] know, you grow up in God, your your
[48:58] family, you're blessed with a family
[49:00] that'll uh raise you in this in this
[49:03] walk of life. Then you see people start
[49:06] to stray away and you know, like they do
[49:09] things that you were told was bad as
[49:11] kids.
[49:13] I would hate myself because I did not
[49:19] have the strength enough to do the
[49:22] things that they were doing. You know,
[49:25] as even as girls, you know, we wear
[49:27] skirts and dresses. I would hate myself
[49:30] that, oh, you know, I could do other
[49:34] things, but I saw myself as too weak to
[49:39] do it. So, I was like, "Dang, I'm really
[49:41] dumb right now." You know, but I guess
[49:43] it's good. But, um,
[49:47] seeing that, I was like, man, I'm not
[49:49] good enough for God. I'm not even strong
[49:52] enough to try other things that I want
[49:54] to try. Like, where am I right now? You
[49:57] know, and so I went I went around like
[50:01] that for for years. I would just hate
[50:05] myself. And it's those it's your own
[50:08] thoughts that you think. It's not what
[50:10] people tell you. They can tell you stuff
[50:13] or whatever, but it's how you receive it
[50:16] and if it actually is if actually means
[50:19] anything to you.
[50:21] So um
[50:23] honestly
[50:25] a year
[50:27] um from today on or no I don't know last
[50:31] tent meeting Saturday morning service.
[50:34] So yeah, um
[50:38] I don't remember who was preaching
[50:41] but afterwards they had
[50:45] done an altar call and a you know God
[50:49] just started moving you know a lot of my
[50:53] friends were just crying out and stuff
[50:56] and I was like here I am again and God's
[51:00] not touching me.
[51:03] So I sat over there
[51:06] and
[51:07] God started moving on grace and grace
[51:10] was crying out and Joy was on the altar
[51:12] and the other grace and it was just
[51:14] hitting everybody and I just sat there
[51:16] and I and I thought about going to the
[51:19] bathroom or something. But then I
[51:21] couldn't move. I thought, "Oh, I'm
[51:24] getting weak. I didn't eat this morning
[51:26] or something." But then I literally
[51:28] could not move.
[51:31] And I just sat there
[51:35] and I was nothing was happening to me
[51:39] until Joy that at the time I didn't know
[51:42] it was Joy. She started singing I want
[51:45] to be a willing vessel.
[51:48] And I heard those words and I was like
[51:53] God that's all I want to be. I've wanted
[51:57] to be not just a willing vessel. You
[52:00] know, in the Bible, you're told to be
[52:02] bold and you're told to be strong.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; God, I want to be that for you.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; So, Joyce started singing that.
[52:14] And I just started singing that along
[52:16] with her.
[52:18] And every word I said, I was crying cuz
[52:22] it was true. I was like, "God,
[52:26] make me into the vessel
[52:28] you want me to be. I'm tired of being in
[52:34] I'm tired of hating myself."
[52:36] Cuz it takes a lot to hate yourself if
[52:39] y'all ever go through it. It takes a lot
[52:42] to see yourself as not good enough that
[52:48] to someone that
[52:50] supposedly created you, you know?
[52:54] It just goes on deeper levels that way.
[52:58] And I just started crying and singing
[53:03] that. And there are moments in your
[53:06] Christian walk when you know God has
[53:10] heard you. You know, you poured your
[53:13] heart and your soul into every word that
[53:16] you have cried out. And that was that
[53:19] moment for me.
[53:22] It meant everything to me. I put my all
[53:25] into those words
[53:27] and God touched me
[53:31] and filled me with the Holy Ghost that
[53:33] day.
[53:35] And
[53:36] [Music]
[53:42] and I just think, you know, it's a
[53:46] blessing that even though my testimony
[53:48] isn't, I guess, physical actions,
[53:53] it's it's still just as powerful because
[53:58] because God did still deliver me from
[54:01] myself.
[54:06] [Applause]
[54:09] And I I want to say if anybody
[54:12] um
[54:14] if anybody does struggle with mental
[54:17] health or low self-esteem,
[54:20] God can heal you. It's
[54:23] &gt;&gt; it's not a mental health is a real thing
[54:28] &gt;&gt; and
[54:30] God cares about you enough
[54:32] &gt;&gt; to help you through it.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[54:38] [Music]
[54:47] [Applause]
[54:50] Anybody else? Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] [Music]
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. To
[55:00] &gt;&gt; God be the glory.
[55:04] [Applause]
[55:06] &gt;&gt; I just couldn't sit down on God
[55:08] &gt;&gt; because he been too good to me.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but he's been
[55:13] good to me.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; And I make it personal.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; I said, "Anytime you want me to speak
[55:19] for you, I'll speak for you." Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; I was praying this morning before I came
[55:23] and I tell you, God is so good.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; And I was on my knees and I said, "God,
[55:29] what do you want me to do?" Let him
[55:32] leave. And I sit in in the passenger
[55:35] seat. And the Lord said, "When you get
[55:37] there, I want you to give me a high
[55:40] praise."
[55:41] &gt;&gt; So I came in the sanctuary and I sat
[55:45] there and I said, "God, this is not the
[55:46] right time." He said, "Do you love me?"
[55:49] Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; I said, "I love you, Lord." He said,
[55:51] "Well, then give me the high praise."
[55:53] &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't open my mouth. And I
[55:55] said, "God, I don't feel comfortable
[55:56] doing this." He said, "Do you love me?"
[55:59] I said, "I love you, Lord." So, as I
[56:01] began to yield, hey, hey, come on.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; And I allow God to have his holy and
[56:09] mighty way.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; See, I learned years ago I fell in love
[56:13] with his presence.
[56:16] See, it's something about the presence
[56:18] of God that when he come upon you, you
[56:21] don't have no other choice.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Next thing I know, it came up out of my
[56:26] shop, out of my belly, a high praise to
[56:30] the most high God.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I loved the Lord because he knows
[56:34] how to do everything.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; And I heard the heavenly host say, "I
[56:39] just restored the joy of your
[56:41] salvation."
[56:43] See, God made it so simple that he
[56:46] wanted me to tell it so that you can
[56:48] open up while he moves by his spirit.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; I see sometimes God's glory movement. I
[56:54] just stand in awe. Said they don't even
[56:57] know you're here. They can't even
[56:59] recognize they are standing in the midst
[57:01] of your glory.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; That's how powerful God is. We forgive
[57:06] his spirit and we get so comfortable in
[57:08] who we are, what we want to do, what we
[57:11] want to think, how we want to act that
[57:14] he watches us. Just watch us. Can you
[57:17] imagine the glory in the place and you
[57:20] not even know it?
[57:23] &gt;&gt; To God be the glory.
[57:28] [Music]
[57:33] [Applause]
[57:35] [Music]
[57:39] I just want to st share a quick little
[57:41] testimony about a time that God saved me
[57:43] for myself. Also about 4 years ago when
[57:47] I I'm 18 now. When I was like
[57:50] 12, nope, math wrong. When I was about
[57:53] 14 in the eighth grade about to graduate
[57:55] from there, I was going through a lot of
[57:57] different mental struggles. My entire
[57:59] life it had been back and forth from
[58:01] different things with my mom, my dad,
[58:02] and this is like to me it felt like
[58:04] everybody left. So, at one point in
[58:06] time, it was something inside of my
[58:07] brain telling me it's my time to leave.
[58:09] I didn't need to be here anymore. I
[58:11] didn't feel like I wanted to be here
[58:12] anymore. And God saved me for myself. At
[58:15] one point in time, I had grabbed a bunch
[58:17] of different pills and I just went and I
[58:19] took them. And then I was ready to go
[58:22] and I was prepared until something just
[58:24] came to my mind and they told me,
[58:25] "You're not ready. It's not your time
[58:27] yet. Call 911." I called 911. I called
[58:30] my mom. I called my godmom. I called
[58:32] everybody and they came there quick.
[58:33] They rushed me to the hospital and they
[58:35] said it was close. It was like it was a
[58:37] chance that I could have been going
[58:38] today. I wasn't going. They started to
[58:40] pump me. I went into the hospital for a
[58:42] week or so and I stayed. And it's been
[58:44] these past four years has been a
[58:45] struggle with my own mental health with
[58:47] different things telling me you don't
[58:48] need to be here. it's not you're not
[58:49] ready to be here. And then it's been
[58:51] different fights with God telling me you
[58:52] should be here. This is your world. This
[58:54] is the time that you're supposed to be
[58:55] here. You're here for good things.
[58:56] You're here to do good things. And I
[58:58] never believed that myself until I just
[59:00] started to realize they're telling you
[59:02] different messages. It's different
[59:03] things that you have to listen to. God
[59:05] is showing you different ways. You're
[59:06] trying to take this path and that's not
[59:08] the path that he wants you to go on. So,
[59:10] I've been continuing to struggle with my
[59:11] mental health, and I'm just glad that I
[59:13] got to be here, to see myself walk
[59:14] across the stage, to see my nephew born,
[59:16] to see my family continue, to see my
[59:18] brothers grow. And I just thank God
[59:20] because without him, I wouldn't have
[59:21] been here today.
[59:23] [Music]
[59:26] [Applause]
[59:27] [Music]
[59:28] [Applause]
[59:30] [Music]
[59:35] &gt;&gt; So, how many months it was? Uh my dad
[59:39] passed and
[59:42] um I think it's like two weeks after he
[59:45] passed I prayed I prayed to God asked
[59:47] him to send me a message to God send me
[59:51] basically I was praying on my knees and
[59:53] asked God can he send my dad can can
[59:57] basically I can't explain it I just had
[1:00:00] it in my head uh can
[1:00:05] I was on my knees on my like on my knees
[1:00:07] on my bed praying to God like I do every
[1:00:09] night. But I was praying. I asked God,
[1:00:13] "Can he send me a message to let my let
[1:00:16] me know my dad's okay." That night, I
[1:00:19] went to sleep. I had a I had a dream.
[1:00:23] And the dream I had was everything was
[1:00:27] like everything was just weird. And I
[1:00:31] was in my old apartment and
[1:00:34] I was in my old apartment. And I act I
[1:00:37] saw my dad and he came up to me and
[1:00:40] said, "Everything's going to be all
[1:00:41] right, so everything's going to be all
[1:00:43] right." But at first, like I think a
[1:00:46] year after that, I didn't really I
[1:00:47] questioned myself about God. I told my
[1:00:50] mom, I don't know if God's real, but he
[1:00:54] he basically showed up in my life
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; through time through time. And I had to
[1:00:59] realize that. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; So when I realized God's real, that that
[1:01:04] showed me that was the example right
[1:01:06] there that God was real.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; So when he showed me, I was I wasn't
[1:01:12] crying, but I was happy to let cuz he
[1:01:14] let me know my dad's okay. He He's in
[1:01:17] heaven. He's going to be okay.
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:22] [Applause]
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:24] [Applause]
[1:01:29] At this time,
[1:01:33] it's good to see that God is still
[1:01:36] moving
[1:01:37] in the young people. I'm young myself,
[1:01:39] but it's good to see that he's moving in
[1:01:42] our lives.
[1:01:44] A lot of us deal with different things
[1:01:45] and a lot of time we grow up in church
[1:01:47] like she said we hear all the things
[1:01:49] over and over and over again but we
[1:01:51] don't really understand or it's not real
[1:01:53] to us but I'm glad today we get to see
[1:01:55] that it is real to us.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; It's real to us.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; I mean we grow up on the shoulders of
[1:02:01] the old saints that been there and they
[1:02:03] tell you don't go this way, don't go
[1:02:06] that way. Don't go this way. Do we
[1:02:07] listen? No,
[1:02:10] we don't listen. But God, he got to
[1:02:14] bring us back.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; I forgot the phrase you said. He got to
[1:02:17] beat us up.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Bust us up. Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; But I'm glad God is here. He listens to
[1:02:25] our prayer. Amen. At this time, we want
[1:02:28] to
[1:02:30] sing one more song

[1:11:55] getting worse the closer it got to this
[1:11:57] moment.
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And sometimes God gets you to the place.
[1:12:01] See, God wants people, church, to not
[1:12:04] just demonstrate
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; what it's like to praise him when you
[1:12:08] come out.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; He needs some people to demonstrate how
[1:12:12] to praise him while you're in it.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; I just want to sing a little bit of the
[1:12:16] song.
[1:12:18] With my hands lifted up
[1:12:22] [Music]

[1:15:33] Amen. Is that your prayer this morning?
[1:15:39] Now, he going to test you out on that
[1:15:40] now.
[1:15:42] Are you going to be able to give him
[1:15:44] praise when your flesh says you should
[1:15:46] not? Amen. So, we thank God for his
[1:15:48] presence on this morning.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I need to sing that to get to
[1:15:53] help me deal with the nerves. And I feel
[1:15:54] a I'm still nervous, but I feel a little
[1:15:56] bit better.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to just man take a few
[1:15:59] minutes this morning and then I'm going
[1:16:02] to turn it over to our brother Caleb.
[1:16:03] Man, we going to kind of tag team here.
[1:16:06] I'm going to do about 15 20 minutes and
[1:16:08] and turn it over to him to close us out.
[1:16:11] Uh but I didn't not really going to
[1:16:13] preach this morning. I kind of just want
[1:16:14] to tell my testimony.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Um I'm going have to leave some parts
[1:16:20] out cuz my mama and dad is sitting in
[1:16:22] here. So,
[1:16:23] [Laughter]
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; So, hope it can be an encouragement to
[1:16:32] you because I think we all should have a
[1:16:33] testimony.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Uh, we all should have a a a walk with
[1:16:37] Christ that we can have learned from,
[1:16:39] that we can share with other people and
[1:16:40] be of encouragement. And this is the
[1:16:42] first time I've ever done this. I've
[1:16:43] never really told my testimony and the
[1:16:45] things God has brought me through in my
[1:16:47] life for about 15 20 minutes. Amen.
[1:16:50] Hopefully I want to not to prolong the
[1:16:52] time. Let's turn straight to the word
[1:16:54] here in Mark chapter 10. Very familiar
[1:16:57] passage of scripture. Uh but how many
[1:16:59] know it's a blessing when you can see
[1:17:01] yourself in the text?
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; This thought came to me a few uh few uh
[1:17:12] weeks ago actually. And uh when Caleb
[1:17:15] texted me and said, "Hey, you got about,
[1:17:17] you know, 15 20 minutes. I'm not going
[1:17:18] to preach the whole sermon, but maybe
[1:17:20] share a few points here
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; like it be of encouragement to you. Very
[1:17:24] familiar passage of scripture. It says,
[1:17:25] "And when he was uh verse 17 says, "And
[1:17:28] when he was gone forth into the way,
[1:17:31] there came one running and kneel to him
[1:17:32] and asked him, good master, what shall I
[1:17:35] do that I may inherit
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; eternal life?" That's a very good
[1:17:39] question to ask, is it not? And Jesus
[1:17:42] said unto him, why callst thou me good?
[1:17:45] There is none good but one and that is
[1:17:47] God. Thou knowest the commandments. Do
[1:17:50] not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not
[1:17:52] steal. Do not bear false witness.
[1:17:54] Defraud not. Honor thy father and
[1:17:56] mother. And he answered and said unto
[1:17:58] him, Master, all of the thing all of
[1:18:01] these things I've observed from my
[1:18:04] youth.
[1:18:05] Then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[1:18:09] said unto him one thing that thou
[1:18:13] lackest,
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; go thy way, said whatsoever thou hast
[1:18:16] and give to the poor, and thou shall
[1:18:18] have treasure in heaven, and come take
[1:18:20] up your cross and follow me. May the
[1:18:22] Lord add blessing to the reading of his
[1:18:23] word, you may be seated. Amen. Caleb,
[1:18:26] keep me honest on my time. Just tug on
[1:18:28] my code if I'll play some notes on the
[1:18:29] keyboard. Amen. Um I want to use for a
[1:18:33] uh thought um maximize your potential.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Uh the prophet of God said in the
[1:18:40] message investments he said when Jesus
[1:18:42] saw the rich the rich young ruler he
[1:18:45] said Jesus knowed that there was a much
[1:18:50] potential
[1:18:51] to this young man.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my right.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; So Jesus saw his potential but we know
[1:18:58] how the story ends. So clearly potential
[1:19:00] just ain't going to cut it.
[1:19:03] [Laughter]
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Here's the spiritual definition of the
[1:19:06] word
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; potential. It is the God-given capacity,
[1:19:11] gifts, and purpose placed inside of you
[1:19:15] that has not yet been fully revealed,
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; developed, or manifested,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; but can be if surrendered to God.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; It is the difference between where you
[1:19:32] are right now,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; okay?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; And where God created you to be.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; We were born on purpose for a purpose.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus is looking at this rich
[1:19:48] young ruler, he's not looking at where
[1:19:51] he was at that moment.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Okay? That's why you you you you can't
[1:19:56] be afraid and say, "Man, I've people
[1:19:57] tell me all the time, brother, I got to
[1:19:59] get my life right. I got to clean this
[1:20:00] up." You can't clean yourself up.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; I got to stop. I got to I got to fix
[1:20:06] this up. God wants you to come as you
[1:20:08] are because he sees your potential.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Thank Jean said yesterday, whom he
[1:20:14] forneew, he predestinated to be
[1:20:16] conformed in his image. That's your
[1:20:18] potential.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; So, as I look at my life
[1:20:27] as a believer growing up,
[1:20:32] uh uh most of us in here, like me, grew
[1:20:36] up in the church.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Growing up in the church my whole life.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Born in the church, raised in the
[1:20:41] church.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Watch my parents come out of
[1:20:44] denominational church into the message
[1:20:46] of this hour.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; I seen a lot as a kid.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:51] growing up hearing the word preached,
[1:20:53] going to Mullins, going to Marian,
[1:20:55] driving up down the road in church in
[1:20:57] Sunday school, Sunday morning, in
[1:20:59] church, Sunday morning worship service,
[1:21:01] Sunday evening service, Tuesday night
[1:21:03] prayer, Wednesday night Bible study,
[1:21:05] Friday night. Do I have any witnesses
[1:21:07] out there?
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't got time to do nothing?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; My God. My God. My God.
[1:21:20] church all week.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And you thought you had your Saturday.
[1:21:23] No, we going to choir rehearsal.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; But still, church, I still needed an
[1:21:31] experience.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; see, all of that was just exposure.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; And exposure ain't experience.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; You can't live off your exposure.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Your exposure will get you to church,
[1:21:46] but your experience will change you.
[1:21:49] Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Your exposure would cause you to cry
[1:21:51] out, but your experience will keep you
[1:21:54] in Christ.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; So, as we look at the rich young ruler
[1:22:02] here, the Bible says Jesus responded
[1:22:04] says, "Go thy way and sell whatsoever
[1:22:07] thou hast and give to the poor and came
[1:22:11] and come and take up the cross and
[1:22:12] follow me." So, as I got older in my
[1:22:15] walk with Christ, seeing the power of
[1:22:16] God move, demons being cast out,
[1:22:20] miracles, signs, and wonders, I'm seeing
[1:22:22] all of this with my own two eyes.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; But as I got older and made it to high
[1:22:29] school and I dealt with something called
[1:22:32] peer pressure,
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; the pressure to fit in.
[1:22:39] Yes, sir.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; They say in those ages when you're in
[1:22:41] your teenage years to about 22, the
[1:22:44] pressure to be in a community.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; See, when I was in my and they say
[1:22:49] you're a a product of your environment,
[1:22:52] when my environment was church, it was
[1:22:53] easy to fit in if all I knew and was
[1:22:55] around was church people.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Good, brother.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; But when I got in high school and they
[1:23:01] were asking me questions like, uh, did
[1:23:03] you hear that new song by Outcast that
[1:23:05] came out last week? And I was like,
[1:23:07] what?
[1:23:09] Outcast
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; when all I knew was the Nikes that mama
[1:23:15] bought me. But when I went to high
[1:23:16] school and seen the Jordans and I there
[1:23:18] was a conflict. I want to be like them.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; I want to fit in.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; I want to be identified.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Then initially it was uncomfortable. But
[1:23:34] how many know if you let sin linger,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; it would make you comfortable wasting
[1:23:39] time.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; You get comfortable with wasting time.
[1:23:44] Oh, I got time. I got time to get right.
[1:23:47] I got time to make this right. No, you
[1:23:49] don't. God is soon to come.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Get you comfortable wasting time coming
[1:23:57] to church, leaving, doing all this other
[1:23:59] stuff,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; no results.
[1:24:03] So I and I'm speeding up here. So I went
[1:24:05] through my my years of high school and I
[1:24:08] got good at being an actor.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; When I came to church,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I pulled my pants up.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; When I got to school,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; I pulled them down cuz the devil told me
[1:24:22] nobody in church here.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah, your sisters go to the school, but
[1:24:26] they not in your class.
[1:24:28] You can please the world and please
[1:24:30] church church at the same time.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And as long as you do that, God's okay
[1:24:35] with it.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Expose the devil, brother.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Sorry, mama and daddy. It's It's okay.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not where I used to be.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; So, I got real good at it.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; I I was a great actor, but how many know
[1:24:53] God don't want actors and actresses? He
[1:24:56] wants puppets. That gives him the
[1:24:57] strength.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; That's what he want.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; But I I found myself as I got older
[1:25:06] coming to the altar slain in the spirit,
[1:25:09] crying out to God because I realized
[1:25:12] that where I was wasn't where I was
[1:25:13] supposed to be.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; You church, here's the thing. When you
[1:25:18] genuinely and authentically get in God's
[1:25:20] presence, you cannot leave the same.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] It's impossible to leave the same when
[1:25:27] you authentically and genuinely enter
[1:25:29] into his presence.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; So I'm coming up to the altar crying out
[1:25:35] authentically and genuinely want this
[1:25:37] pro. See, here's the mistake we make. We
[1:25:39] allow sin in our lives
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; to linger.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the weapons of our
[1:25:45] warfare are not carnal,
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; but they are mighty through God by how?
[1:25:50] Tearing down of strongholds. So when you
[1:25:52] allow one thing to linger, guess what?
[1:25:54] You give the devil a brick.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And then he adds to that brick. And then
[1:25:58] he adds to that brick. And see, what I
[1:26:00] was wanting is to come up to the altar,
[1:26:02] the preacher, pray for me, and God sends
[1:26:04] a bulldozer and just wipe the whole
[1:26:06] fortress down.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; You got to deal with how you got there.
[1:26:13] [Applause]
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; You got to process. How did I get to
[1:26:18] this point?
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How did I go from a Sunday
[1:26:21] school boy playing the drums, happy,
[1:26:23] singing songs to now I'm cussing like a
[1:26:26] sailor?
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; How did I get to this point to where I'm
[1:26:31] having bitterness in my heart?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; It didn't happen overnight, but we
[1:26:35] expect God just to get a bulldozer and
[1:26:37] fix it in one prayer line.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; You got to deal with how did I get here?
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; What have I allowed in my life? Yes,
[1:26:47] sir.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Who have I been hanging around with?
[1:26:49] Because God can deliver you right here
[1:26:51] on this altar. But you can literally
[1:26:53] walk right out that door and put the
[1:26:54] chains back on.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Save me from my cursing
[1:27:01] spirit. And you walk around and hang
[1:27:03] with the same people who curse.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; You go watch the same movies with
[1:27:08] cursing in it.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; God is saying, "What are you doing?"
[1:27:13] Come on now.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Who the son is set free is free indeed.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; God don't do he don't take no two step.
[1:27:21] Bring it back. We'll try to. He's not a
[1:27:22] mechanic that says try it again.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; When he fixes it the first time, you
[1:27:26] ain't got to come back.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Get me a mechanic that's going to get
[1:27:31] down to the nitty-gritty.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; I don't want no quick fix.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; A lot of times that's church. That's
[1:27:36] what we want. We want a quick fix
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; when we've got to deal with how we got
[1:27:40] there.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Teach him, brother.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; How much time I got?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Good. All right.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:27:49] I found myself in this vicious cycle
[1:27:53] coming to church, feeling the spirit of
[1:27:55] God move in a mighty way, crying my eyes
[1:27:57] out, playing the drums, and I was
[1:28:00] comfortable with walking back out with
[1:28:02] no results.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz the devil had lied to me and said,
[1:28:05] "Brother Matias, this is what it's
[1:28:07] supposed to be like.
[1:28:09] How you going to save the world and you
[1:28:12] talking and acting like the world? I
[1:28:14] completely I had it all messed up.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And if you look at the rich young ruler
[1:28:19] here, Jesus says one thing that thou
[1:28:24] lackest. And here's the here is the
[1:28:25] conflict when I when I read this passage
[1:28:27] of scripture that I tied it back to
[1:28:28] brother Matias's life. It's that the
[1:28:31] rich young ruler did not want to suffer.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; My lord,
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; he did not want to be in the place. You
[1:28:38] mean to tell me I got to be broke?
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Because this whole time there was no
[1:28:45] suffering.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; There was no pain.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; When the way you are identified with
[1:28:51] Christ, the Bible say all that live
[1:28:53] godly will suffer.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; But what I wanted to do was not suffer
[1:28:59] and still be identified with Christ.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; It don't work like that.
[1:29:06] You have to go through some stuff. And
[1:29:08] I'm not talking about, oh, I had a flat
[1:29:10] tire today and uh I had to been stuck.
[1:29:12] I'm talking about suffering for his
[1:29:14] name.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Why you don't know about rap music? Cuz
[1:29:16] brother, I don't listen to it.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Why you don't do these things? Because
[1:29:21] that's not what I believe. Suffering,
[1:29:23] ridicule.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to deal with that.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; And it put me in a vicious cycle to
[1:29:31] where I was way. See, the God saw the
[1:29:33] rich young rulers potential, church.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Everybody in here has potential to be
[1:29:39] formed in God's image, his purpose for
[1:29:41] your life.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; But potential enough alone won't get you
[1:29:45] there. Is that okay?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; No cross, no crown.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; So, I was exposed to a lot. I I knew God
[1:29:56] was real,
[1:29:58] but how many know he has to be real in
[1:30:00] your life?
[1:30:03] Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; You you you can't go off nobody else's
[1:30:05] testimony. That's why the Bible says,
[1:30:06] "Taste and see
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; that the Lord is good." A I just want to
[1:30:10] smell the cake.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Smelling the cake just gives me exposure
[1:30:14] to the cake. Put it in my mouth.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Let me taste our taste.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want to rob God of
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; of us experiencing. Think about a book
[1:30:28] somebody gives you. I give you this book
[1:30:30] and I say, "Man, this is a good book.
[1:30:32] You're going to like it." And you get
[1:30:34] all excited.
[1:30:36] Then I tell you what the book is about.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Your excitement is gone.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we want God to give us the
[1:30:43] answers as to why.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; And God is saying, "Why would I rob you
[1:30:46] of your experience?"
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; That's why he don't give us answers to
[1:30:50] why. Come on, brother.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; So, I I I had exposure in church. I I
[1:30:59] was exposed to uh God. But but brother
[1:31:02] Matias just wanted to cut corners. The
[1:31:05] prophet of God said in seeking after
[1:31:06] Jesus that every son that cometh to God
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; must first first
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; be tried
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; and chasened of God.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; But I wanted to I wanted to skip that
[1:31:19] part. I don't like that. I still want to
[1:31:21] be a child of God, but I don't want to
[1:31:24] be chasened of God. I don't want to be
[1:31:27] tried by God. So, you got to prove who
[1:31:29] you are.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And in that moment, that was the Rick
[1:31:32] Jones ruler's opportunity to prove what
[1:31:34] he valued most. Because I believe he
[1:31:36] loved God, but he didn't love God first.
[1:31:43] coming to church, getting convicted,
[1:31:45] word coming forth,
[1:31:48] and see the word of God, prophet God
[1:31:49] puts, is like a looking glass.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; It's going to tell the truth on you each
[1:31:53] and every time.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; That's why keep coming to church.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Don't let nobody discourage you. Keep
[1:31:59] coming to church.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; It's like a scale. You go to the doctor,
[1:32:05] man. Doctor says you need to lose some
[1:32:07] weight. You got high blood pressure.
[1:32:10] Brother Matias, this is your this is
[1:32:11] your diet. You need to stop eating this.
[1:32:14] You need to stop eating this. And if you
[1:32:15] do that, you lose the mount of weight
[1:32:18] and you'll be healthy.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you three weeks.
[1:32:22] You cut corners if you want to.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Here's one thing that will always tell
[1:32:28] the truth. When you step on that scale,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; it's going to look right back up at you
[1:32:36] and say, "You
[1:32:40] Don't care nothing about how you feel.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Don't care nothing about how bad you
[1:32:45] want it.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; You ain't been following the plan.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Know how bad you want it.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; You lying.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen, brother.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; And nobody else can get on that scale
[1:33:00] but you.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; The doctor can't get on that. The pastor
[1:33:04] can't.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; You got to stand on that scale.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. Amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; It's like you looking in the mirror. I
[1:33:11] was telling the church in Marian this
[1:33:12] last week. You don't get mad when you
[1:33:14] look in the mirror and they tell you you
[1:33:16] have messed up.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; All right, brother.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "Thank you, mirror.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; I didn't see that."
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; You take your time. Put your uniform on.
[1:33:26] Put your work clothes on. You think you
[1:33:29] look good, but every time you don't
[1:33:30] trust your own two eyes, you go right to
[1:33:32] that mirror
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; because the mirror is what other people
[1:33:35] see.
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:37] You don't see your shoes on the wrong
[1:33:39] feet and walk out and say, "No big
[1:33:40] deal."
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; You fix it.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And God will show you through his word.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Wear you off.
[1:33:49] [Applause]
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Because in in order to really change,
[1:33:54] church, we have to allow God to deal
[1:33:56] with the errors of our life that we have
[1:33:58] closed off to him.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Revelations 3 says he's standing at the
[1:34:02] door knocking. He's not going to force
[1:34:04] himself in. He's not gonna squeeze
[1:34:06] himself in through the crack. You got to
[1:34:08] rip the door off the hinges.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, bro.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, deal with
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; with what I'm with what I'm going
[1:34:16] through. So, I'm I'mma sum this up. So,
[1:34:19] I came my my my my I guess you my moment
[1:34:22] of reckoning. I went through many many
[1:34:24] years uh going through this cycle of
[1:34:28] lying to myself.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Uh we were at a meeting one night in
[1:34:32] Aken. I'll never forget it. It was at
[1:34:34] brother Jackson's church. Brother Kyle
[1:34:35] Kelly was preaching and I was at the
[1:34:38] altar again.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; crying. Same thing every year. See, we
[1:34:44] got to stop and ask, if we're not seeing
[1:34:46] results, what am I doing wrong?
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Church, we in this mess. We supposed to
[1:34:52] see results.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And if you're not, you need to take a
[1:34:56] step back. Lord, what is going on?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; That's what Joshua did. He said, Lord,
[1:35:00] you said we had the victory. Come on.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Hold up. We ain't supposed to be like
[1:35:04] this.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Said, "Lord, you said in your word, we
[1:35:09] supposed to be victorious." Something
[1:35:10] something off.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; So, I'm at the altar boohooing. Brother
[1:35:17] Kao preached a powerful sermon,
[1:35:19] convicted my heart, came up here, cry,
[1:35:22] and said, "Lord, I want you to fix this.
[1:35:23] I'm sorry, Lord. I I'm going to do
[1:35:25] better."
[1:35:28] And I was sitting on the front row and
[1:35:29] it was a brother right next to me.
[1:35:33] And as I was wiping the tears off my
[1:35:36] eyes, coming down,
[1:35:40] I heard him in the side view.
[1:35:44] He was crying out to God
[1:35:47] and he said, "Lord,
[1:35:50] please let it be real this time."
[1:35:52] Hallelujah.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; I mean, he's crying to didn't care who
[1:35:56] was hearing him. Screaming to the L. He
[1:35:59] says, "Lord, I'm tired of playing
[1:36:01] church.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother."
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And then he start going into detail
[1:36:06] things that I'm like, "Bro, what you
[1:36:08] saying?" But he was in that moment
[1:36:10] identifying the root of his problem.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I like listening to rap
[1:36:19] music, but help me with that.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I like doing this and I like
[1:36:25] help. That's what Paul was in chapter
[1:36:26] Romans chapter 7. He was honest to God
[1:36:29] about himself.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; But one of the sisters just said that
[1:36:33] God delivered them from their self.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; In order for there to be no
[1:36:38] condemnation, you have to be honest with
[1:36:41] God with where you are. Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; That Canaanite woman, she comes to Jesus
[1:36:49] with a need.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; But Jesus already knew she was a
[1:36:53] gentile.
[1:36:55] She comes, "Lord, savior, I got I got a
[1:36:58] need." The Bible says he did not even
[1:37:00] respond to her.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because she was trying to be
[1:37:03] something that she was not.
[1:37:08] Prophet of God said that if you want God
[1:37:10] to fix you and to help you, you got to
[1:37:12] be first honest with yourself.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You got to evaluate your own self to
[1:37:18] make sure you're in the faith.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; So, in that moment, you can get ready,
[1:37:23] brother Caleb. In that moment, I'm
[1:37:24] listening to this brother cry out and I
[1:37:27] realized
[1:37:29] like the prodical son,
[1:37:32] this ain't supposed to be like this.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] Because there is a purpose for my life.
[1:37:38] And my purpose cannot be manifested by
[1:37:41] going in a vicious cycle,
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; asking God for deliverance, but walking
[1:37:45] out, coming back to church, same time,
[1:37:47] same place, defeated.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; No growth,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; no results. But church, my walk with
[1:37:54] Christ did not officially start until I
[1:37:56] became honest with myself and how I got
[1:38:00] to this point. Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, if you want me to deliver, I
[1:38:03] promise you when I leave, I'm going to
[1:38:05] take those friends away.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; See, that's why the Bible says, "If any
[1:38:09] man come after me, the first person you
[1:38:11] got to deal with is yourself."
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; How you going to deny yourself when
[1:38:18] you're lying to yourself?
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; You can't do it.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; You got to be honest. Because anytime
[1:38:26] you come to Christ Church, I promise
[1:38:27] you, he's going to ask you for
[1:38:28] something. He
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; sure is. And if he ain't ask you for
[1:38:30] something, you ain't met him yet.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Any man come after me, he has to deny
[1:38:38] himself.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's why when my sister said that, she
[1:38:41] said, "God delivered me from myself."
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; You got to figure out what areas in your
[1:38:48] life you've given the devil permission
[1:38:50] to operate.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; That's how you tear down strongholds.
[1:38:55] What area has I reasoned with? What area
[1:38:58] has I allowed? Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; To where I have moments of victory,
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; but I never truly overcome.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; That's good, bro.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; That's where it starts being honest with
[1:39:10] yourself.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Talk to God. He already knows you.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; He knew that woman was a gentile.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not going to respond to
[1:39:20] you till you be honest with who you
[1:39:23] are." Right.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Songwriter says, "I came to Jesus just
[1:39:27] as I was."
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Come to him like you are. Don't put on a
[1:39:32] show. Don't put on a front.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Tell him how you feel. And I promise
[1:39:36] you, church, that's when your journey
[1:39:37] starts. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[1:39:39] clap of praise. Turn it back over to
[1:39:41] Brother Caleb.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Well, the good thing that I'm going to
[1:40:02] tell you this morning is you don't have
[1:40:05] to read another scripture.
[1:40:08] Because as soon as he opened up the
[1:40:11] Bible and he said Mark chapter 10,
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; I turned to them over there and I said
[1:40:15] he took my scripture
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; because it was the same scripture that I
[1:40:21] was going to read this morning.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; And the tricky thing when you're
[1:40:29] speaking behind someone is Lord, you
[1:40:31] want to be in the same channel.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And so I was praying. And I said, "Lord,
[1:40:35] I don't want to say something and have
[1:40:37] the people one way and take them another
[1:40:38] way." And the Lord got me here.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; So, the topic that I have this morning
[1:40:43] that I want to take you in, I'm going to
[1:40:44] ask you a question. And it follows and
[1:40:46] it ties right in because the question
[1:40:48] that I want to ask you is, are you
[1:40:50] satisfied with your relationship with
[1:40:52] God?
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Because he was just testifying and
[1:40:56] telling you at one point in time, he had
[1:40:58] to realize that he wasn't satisfied
[1:41:00] where he was. He wasn't satisfied with
[1:41:03] going to church and going outside and
[1:41:05] doing something different. He wasn't
[1:41:07] satisfied with coming and seeing God
[1:41:09] move and something not changing his
[1:41:11] life.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; But one day, you got to get to the point
[1:41:14] where you say, "Lord, I expect you to do
[1:41:16] something for me that when I leave this
[1:41:18] place, I'm forever changed."
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we get to the point like
[1:41:24] this young rich ruler and I wrote some
[1:41:27] things down and I said one day he got
[1:41:29] satisfied.
[1:41:30] say he wanted more. He wanted he wanted
[1:41:34] more than what he had at the moment. He
[1:41:36] came to God because he wanted more.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; When he came to him, he said, "Lord,
[1:41:41] what must I do to obtain eternal life?
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; But when he when God gave him the
[1:41:46] answer, see, he didn't want to sacrifice
[1:41:49] what he had achieved
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; to get what God had for him."
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Many of times in life, we get to the
[1:41:56] point that we're always going for what
[1:41:57] we want to achieve. We want this new
[1:42:00] job. We want this new car. We want this
[1:42:02] new house. We want this family. We want
[1:42:04] all these things. But when God comes to
[1:42:07] you and say, "Will you give it up for
[1:42:09] me?"
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; That's the moment that we choose that we
[1:42:13] want it more.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; What we got planned for ourselves, we
[1:42:16] want that more.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; We said, "You know what, Lord? I'm
[1:42:19] satisfied with where I am with you.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; I want this more than what you can give
[1:42:23] me."
[1:42:24] But you see the young rich ruler, he
[1:42:26] didn't realize that if he would have
[1:42:28] gave it up,
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; gave it up.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; If he would have gave up those riches,
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; he cannot get what God had prepared for
[1:42:36] him.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; He all the stuff that he had built, all
[1:42:38] the stuff that he had achieved was not
[1:42:40] greater than what God was going to give
[1:42:42] to him.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; He might have had the biggest house and
[1:42:45] acres and everything, but it wasn't
[1:42:47] better than the mansion that God had
[1:42:48] prepared for him. It wasn't better than
[1:42:51] the cattle on a thousand hills. It
[1:42:53] wasn't better than all those things.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; But one day he said, he said, "I'm going
[1:42:57] to settle with just being a good
[1:42:59] churchgoer."
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to settle with going to church
[1:43:03] and going to church on See, he was a
[1:43:05] good church goer.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Unlike some people, he didn't just show
[1:43:08] up on Sunday.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't just show up on Sunday and
[1:43:11] Wednesday
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; or Sunday and Tuesday or Friday or
[1:43:14] whenever your church has service. He was
[1:43:17] one that a he he he lived right.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; He lived right. Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; I said he lived right.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz some people in church but don't live
[1:43:28] right.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; He lived right. He obeyed the
[1:43:32] commandments. He did everything that he
[1:43:34] knew to do.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; But there was something missing.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; There was something missing.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; And he had to realize that he wasn't
[1:43:42] satisfied with his relationship with
[1:43:44] God.
[1:43:45] And when he came to the this this this
[1:43:47] this cruc this moment this intersection
[1:43:51] he had to make a choice.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; And every when you come to God sometime
[1:43:56] God allow you to make a choice.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; If he knocks on the door some of us we
[1:44:01] get up and we answer the door. We let
[1:44:03] God in the living room.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; We invite God that you know what Lord
[1:44:07] you can come on. You can have something
[1:44:09] to eat. But when God goes over there to
[1:44:12] that one door,
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; that one door, that that thing that
[1:44:16] nobody else knows about but you,
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; nobody can see it but you.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; But you see, God is the God of the light
[1:44:22] and the dark.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; So what you done in the dark, sometimes
[1:44:25] it comes to the light.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; I was talking to one of my friends and
[1:44:29] sometimes I get the realization. I said,
[1:44:31] you know, if God was to one day
[1:44:36] lift the cover off of your life for 10
[1:44:38] seconds,
[1:44:39] for 10 seconds.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Now, mind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; If God was to lift that cover off
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; and we were to see what was behind that
[1:44:50] cover,
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; all of us would be thanking God right
[1:44:53] now.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; We'd be shouting all around the room
[1:44:55] that God don't lift the cover.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Because if God was to lift the cover, we
[1:45:00] would understand what God sees.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; He don't see everything that people can
[1:45:05] put up the front. He doesn't see the
[1:45:07] good Christian person. He sees the
[1:45:09] person that you are,
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; the person that's deep down inside. But
[1:45:13] see, God allows us to one day go down on
[1:45:17] our knees
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, wash me.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, wash me in that blood."
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. And when he washes you in
[1:45:26] that blood,
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; he said you can come up white as snow.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; And see, if you haven't had that
[1:45:32] experience, you might not understand
[1:45:34] what I'm talking about. You might not
[1:45:36] understand the joy that I have that the
[1:45:39] world didn't give to me. Cuz when I look
[1:45:42] back over my life and realize what God
[1:45:44] has done for me,
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; hey, I don't have to shout off of your
[1:45:47] testimony. I don't have to look at your
[1:45:50] testimony. I can go down and shout for
[1:45:52] myself.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Because God has been real to me.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Some people shouting off of other people
[1:45:59] testimony and don't have a testimony of
[1:46:01] their own.
[1:46:04] But you see that that it became
[1:46:06] different. Sometimes you'll hear people
[1:46:08] like they said to my brother was saying
[1:46:10] and I'm glad for the young people to
[1:46:11] come forward and I might not be that old
[1:46:14] as he said but listen I'm glad to see
[1:46:16] God being real to you
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; because it's not till you have a real
[1:46:21] experience with God that you understand
[1:46:23] what's being talked about
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; that you understand what actually
[1:46:27] everybody is so happy about what people
[1:46:30] come to church for and they shout all
[1:46:31] over the place. It's not a show. It's
[1:46:33] something that's real.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; But if it's never been real to you, you
[1:46:37] might just look at it and say, "They
[1:46:39] just doing that."
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; But realizing that someday, sometime
[1:46:44] it's got to get real to you.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; If it don't, you going to miss it.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; It's that simple.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; If you don't decide to give up what you
[1:46:52] want, you going to miss God.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; When God comes knocking on your door,
[1:46:56] you need to answer.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; We don't have that much time to go. If
[1:47:00] you don't answer, you might miss it.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; And when and if you miss it, hey, you
[1:47:05] just here.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; And that's not something you want to be.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; That's not somewhere that you want to be
[1:47:11] when those bombs fall, when desolation
[1:47:14] and all these things come come on the
[1:47:16] earth. The prophet of God said that
[1:47:17] cancer would be like a toothache.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; If cancer is the worst thing on that we
[1:47:24] have right now, just imagine if that's
[1:47:26] like a toothache.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the pain that that takes
[1:47:29] people through.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; But you see, if it's like that, that's
[1:47:33] not something I want to be here for.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; That's not something that I want to
[1:47:37] experience.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; I I don't know about you, I don't want
[1:47:39] to exper unimaginable pain,
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; unimaginable suffering.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Like the things that are coming on this
[1:47:46] earth is not things that we can even
[1:47:48] imagine.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; So why would I want to go through that?
[1:47:51] Amen.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; But see, but are you satisfied with your
[1:47:56] relationship with God?
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get to the point that you
[1:47:59] know what, we just going through life.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; We go through our day and we come home
[1:48:03] and we do the same thing tomorrow and we
[1:48:04] do the same thing tomorrow. And then I
[1:48:06] don't know about you, but sometimes if
[1:48:08] you do something too much,
[1:48:11] it gets you a little depressed
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; because you just get into this routine
[1:48:15] like is this all the life? Yeah, true.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Is this is this what it is?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; I just work and I get money and then I
[1:48:24] use the money to pay a bill and then I
[1:48:26] never see this money bill because I'm
[1:48:28] always it's just a cycle that we're
[1:48:30] going through and we wake up and it's
[1:48:32] his cycle. And the only thing to break
[1:48:34] that cycle is having God in your life.
[1:48:37] And when God gets in your life, the it
[1:48:40] changes the cycle. You can go to work
[1:48:42] happy. You can go to work excited
[1:48:45] because you got something to tell
[1:48:46] somebody about. You got something to
[1:48:49] testify about how good God is.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Wonder why you can't tell people a story
[1:48:55] or something? You can't come to work
[1:48:57] with something fresh on your mind
[1:48:58] because you you just got satisfied with
[1:49:00] where you was
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; and that was all you want.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you have to grow and not
[1:49:06] always be a baby. Amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; What I mean by that is sometimes that
[1:49:11] little experience that you have, it has
[1:49:13] to grow into something else.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Some people get a little experience and
[1:49:17] that's all the experience. Well, I know
[1:49:18] that God saved me.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Well, God saved me. And that's the
[1:49:23] testimony. God saved me. God saved me.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; But at some point in time, do you do you
[1:49:28] grow from that?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Do you grow from that? Is there another
[1:49:32] experience that you can point to where I
[1:49:34] know where God saved me and he healed
[1:49:36] me?
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the testimony.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you got to come to Lord, I
[1:49:41] know the experience that I had with you.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; And this ain't a far off experience.
[1:49:45] This was the experience yesterday.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; I can talk about something that wasn't
[1:49:49] years ago that happened, but something
[1:49:51] that's real to me right now.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; And said, I I thank God for the for the
[1:49:56] testimonies I heard today, especially
[1:49:59] the one about mental health, cuz that's
[1:50:00] a real thing. The devil is really
[1:50:02] attacking people's mind. The prophet of
[1:50:04] God said, "The greatest battle ever
[1:50:06] fought is in your mind."
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; And I tell people all the time, some
[1:50:10] people, you know, they ask you that that
[1:50:12] that question. You, what superpower do
[1:50:14] you want?
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; And some people like, I want to read
[1:50:17] minds.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I I want to know exactly what people
[1:50:20] thinking about me. They even made a
[1:50:22] movie about it. And I said, you know
[1:50:25] what? I said, I would never want that
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; because if I had to experience what you
[1:50:32] go through in your mind, Oh, Jesus. No.
[1:50:35] Mm-
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I had to see them demons
[1:50:38] that come attacking you.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No, no, no. I had to see the
[1:50:42] devil try to take you out and bring you
[1:50:45] back. No, some people want that. But I
[1:50:48] said that ain't something that I want
[1:50:49] cuz the worst place to ever be is inside
[1:50:51] of someone's head
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; because you never see you. Some people
[1:50:55] go through physical things. But I tell
[1:50:58] you that mental thing is a real thing
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; because nobody sees what you going
[1:51:03] through.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; The people on the outside when you look
[1:51:05] at them, you don't see it.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; They might have a smile on their face.
[1:51:09] They say some people they be happy one
[1:51:11] day and gone the next.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's things that they're
[1:51:15] battling in their mind.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, there's a God
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; that can deliver you. Come on.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; See, if you didn't hear it today, God
[1:51:24] sent someone to tell you a testimony how
[1:51:26] he can deliver you from the mind battles
[1:51:29] that God is that you may be facing.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; I said, "And nobody is immune from it."
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; That's the difference. Nobody is immune
[1:51:38] from it.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Because the devil, if he can plant that
[1:51:41] seed and let it to grow,
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; he knows that he can eventually get you.
[1:51:47] He knows if God don't come by and step
[1:51:49] in and God don't have someone
[1:51:52] interceding for you,
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; God don't tell somebody, "Hey, pray for
[1:51:55] that someone in the middle of the night
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; or in the middle of the day, God place
[1:51:59] them on your heart." If he don't do
[1:52:01] that, sometimes it's just that quick.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; And some people they do a thing and then
[1:52:06] be like, "It was a mistake."
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; But you can't sometimes change it.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; And see, nobody knows the time, the day,
[1:52:13] or the hour. And I never profess that I
[1:52:15] would know what you going through.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Some people like, "Yeah, you may
[1:52:20] understand, but sometimes if God if you
[1:52:22] ain't been through it, you truly don't
[1:52:24] understand.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; If you don't if you ain't faced it, you
[1:52:27] truly don't understand.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes it takes you coming up to
[1:52:32] a higher level in God for God to do the
[1:52:34] thing for you. It takes you not being
[1:52:36] satisfied and you actually don't care."
[1:52:38] And like the brother said today, he got
[1:52:40] down and the brother was on the altar.
[1:52:42] He didn't care who listened. That's
[1:52:43] right. Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; He didn't care because in that moment he
[1:52:46] needed something that was real.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you got to get past my my
[1:52:51] my who going to look at me, who going to
[1:52:53] see me, who going who going to look at
[1:52:55] this? And you got to get past that and
[1:52:57] say, "Lord, today
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; to right here in this moment, I need
[1:53:02] something from you.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm not satisfied. I don't want to
[1:53:06] go one more moment. I don't want to go
[1:53:08] one more step. I don't want to leave
[1:53:09] this place until you do something for
[1:53:12] me.
[1:53:13] [Applause]
[1:53:15] I said and I and because it was so crazy
[1:53:18] that he read the scripture there and I
[1:53:20] got down see the young rich ruler he was
[1:53:23] in the first half of the scripture but
[1:53:25] in the second half in verse down there
[1:53:27] in verse 32 there was another man
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; no actually in verse let me write um 46
[1:53:34] there's another man that got to the
[1:53:36] place that he wanted something
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; right
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; that man was blind Barnameus
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; and when heard heard that Jesus was
[1:53:43] passing by that way.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Heard,
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; you know, he heard it. Somebody said,
[1:53:48] "Jesus coming by."
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Just like he is this morning. He's right
[1:53:52] here.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; He heard Jesus coming by. And you know
[1:53:56] what he said? He said, "Son of David,
[1:54:00] have mercy on me."
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; See, he sometimes you ain't got you
[1:54:05] can't care who's around you. See, while
[1:54:08] he was testifying and and Lord have
[1:54:10] mercy on me, there was people sh be
[1:54:13] quiet.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; You're making too much noise.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Sh. No, you don't need all that right
[1:54:18] now.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Sh, you know, just just go ahead. It's
[1:54:22] okay if you get on up. It's okay. The
[1:54:25] service is over.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; It's okay. Yeah, that's that's that's
[1:54:32] enough. But sometimes you got to
[1:54:35] supersede that and say, "Lord, I need
[1:54:36] something."
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; I need something.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; And where other others may lead, this
[1:54:41] one may go, but I need something.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; And said Ron Barius, he got to the point
[1:54:46] that he got louder when they told him to
[1:54:48] be quiet.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Because he knew in that moment, he said,
[1:54:51] "I'm not going to let Jesus go past me
[1:54:54] and not do something for me.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let Jesus go walk past
[1:54:59] me and touch this one and touch that one
[1:55:01] and not touch me. I might be on the
[1:55:03] ground. I might be sitting here, but I'm
[1:55:06] not going to let him pass me by.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; And and I want to read something um in
[1:55:15] verse 49.
[1:55:17] And he said, "And Jesus stood still
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; and commanded him to be called." See,
[1:55:24] out of all the crowd of people, Jesus
[1:55:26] might couldn't see him, but he stood
[1:55:27] still. See, he he cried loud enough and
[1:55:30] cried hard enough that it got Jesus
[1:55:32] attention.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you got to get to the
[1:55:35] point that Lord, I got to get your
[1:55:37] attention.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm just a poor weak sinner, but
[1:55:41] Lord, I'm crying because I've given all
[1:55:44] up
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; because I want something for you.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; You can't fill a half filled cup and
[1:55:49] expecting to feel everything to go into
[1:55:51] it.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; You got to empty out. Amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; I I like to tell people if you want to
[1:55:56] get the Holy Ghost, the simplest way is
[1:55:58] to give everything up.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; That's all you got to do.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Give up your plans. Give up your dreams.
[1:56:05] Give up this girl. Give up this guy.
[1:56:08] Give up this money. Give up this people.
[1:56:10] Give up the things that you created in
[1:56:12] your mind as a vision for what I want my
[1:56:14] future to look like.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; You got to give all that up. Good,
[1:56:18] brother.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; You got to give all that up
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; in order for God to fill you up.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; And when God fills you up, he'll give
[1:56:26] you He'll say, "I might not or I might
[1:56:28] not tell you your steps like they said
[1:56:30] this morning, but I will order your
[1:56:31] steps."
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; You don't have to see what the staircase
[1:56:35] looks like, but as long as you Jesus is
[1:56:37] with you, he'll say, "Take this step."
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; And when you take that step, you
[1:56:41] realize, "Oh, Lord, I thank you cuz I
[1:56:44] was going that way, but there you Oh,
[1:56:46] hallelujah." And see, when you
[1:56:48] understand that he orders your steps,
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; my my my it moves you in a different
[1:56:53] direction.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And and it reads, "And they called to my
[1:56:58] man, saying, be of good comfort. Rise he
[1:57:00] calleth thee." And then I verse 50 is
[1:57:03] where I got it. And he,
[1:57:06] this is the most pivotal thing. He cast
[1:57:09] away his garments.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; See, he realized in order for me to get
[1:57:13] to Jesus, I got to leave something.
[1:57:14] Amen.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; I got to leave something here because
[1:57:17] when Jesus does the work for me, I don't
[1:57:19] need that no more.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; When I when I leave this here today, I'm
[1:57:24] not picking it up no more. That's not
[1:57:26] important to me anymore because I met
[1:57:28] someone that has done something for me
[1:57:31] that has changed my life.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Says sometime many of times we get like
[1:57:36] the young rich ruler. We get satisfied.
[1:57:39] So we we comfortable in what we have. We
[1:57:42] get comfortable in what God has blessed
[1:57:45] us with thus far.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; But but if we want if we understand that
[1:57:50] sometimes God asks for your most
[1:57:52] precious thing,
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; whatever that is,
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; he'll ask for your most precious thing.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Whether that might be your girlfriend,
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; your boyfriend,
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; whatever is your most precious thing.
[1:58:06] See, for the young rich ruler, it was
[1:58:08] his possessions.
[1:58:11] But yours might be um it might be your
[1:58:14] career.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; It might be the the thing that you have
[1:58:18] envisioned or you thought about that
[1:58:20] this is where I want to head in life.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; But God asks for your most precious
[1:58:24] thing sometimes. Not because he's not
[1:58:26] going to give it to you.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Come on, bro. Preach. It's because he
[1:58:29] wants you to realize that the path that
[1:58:32] you might be taking might not be the
[1:58:33] path that I want you to go. But if you
[1:58:35] go the way I want you to go, you may end
[1:58:37] up greater
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; than the path that you wanted to go on.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; But if you don't realize that, Lord, I
[1:58:44] got to surrender this
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; because it's not greater than you. I got
[1:58:49] to give this up because it's not greater
[1:58:50] than you. Cuz Lord, I'm not satisfied
[1:58:52] with where I am with you. I'm not
[1:58:55] satisfied with the relationship I got
[1:58:57] with you right now. But in order for me
[1:58:59] to grow closer to you, I got to give
[1:59:01] something up.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; I got to let this go because when I get
[1:59:05] closer to you, Lord, you I want nothing
[1:59:07] to hinder me from going all the way. I
[1:59:10] want nothing to stop me from going all
[1:59:12] the way. Lord, I want nothing to hinder
[1:59:14] me from going to heaven. I want nothing
[1:59:16] to stop me from getting over there.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; So when God calls you, you got to let
[1:59:22] some things go. Even though you might
[1:59:25] not want to, but if you let it go, God
[1:59:27] will give you exactly what you need and
[1:59:30] exceedingly abundantly more than you
[1:59:32] asked or thought
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; because that's the God that we serve.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; But I ask the question to you, are you
[1:59:38] satisfied?
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Are you satisfied or are you just
[1:59:44] settling?
[1:59:46] Good brother.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Are you settling
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; and saying this is all that I want and
[1:59:54] this is all that I need.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Then I question to ask you, are you just
[1:59:58] like the people that he said
[2:00:01] they're rich,
[2:00:03] increase with good, have need of
[2:00:05] nothing?
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Is that you?
[2:00:16] That's the question that I asked you
[2:00:17] this morning.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; All heads bowed and eyes closed.
[2:00:30] Lord, we've heard the word this morning.
[2:00:35] Lord, you spoke about maximizing our
[2:00:37] potential.
[2:00:39] And then Lord, you ask us, are we
[2:00:41] satisfied with our relationship with
[2:00:42] you,
[2:00:46] Lord? We don't want to settle,
[2:00:51] Lord. We don't want to get to that place
[2:00:52] where, Lord, we say, Lord, you know, I
[2:00:55] don't need more of you.
[2:00:58] But Lord, this morning, I ask that you
[2:01:00] would do something.
[2:01:02] that you would change a heart, a mind, a
[2:01:05] life that when they leave this place,
[2:01:09] your presence goes with them.
[2:01:13] And Lord, when they leave this place,
[2:01:15] they're forever changed.
[2:01:18] Lord, we ask that you
[2:01:21] just move in a mighty and a special way.
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:30] Oh hallelujah Jesus.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Yes Jesus.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; God is calling somebody this morning.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Jesus.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; In that still small voice.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; You could come to Jesus.
[2:01:45] [Music]
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; You can make your way to the altar this
[2:01:48] morning.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; If you haven't repented and been
[2:01:51] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:01:53] Christ.
[2:01:55] Why not do it today?
[2:01:57] While the master is calling,
[2:02:00] somebody come home this morning.
[2:02:04] Somebody come to Jesus.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; He wants to give you life and peace.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; He wants to give you joy unspeakable and
[2:02:15] full of glory.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; But it takes courage sometimes.
[2:02:22] Takes a willing heart
[2:02:25] to say, "Jesus,
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; tired of the way that I am.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; help me, God.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; I need your help.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Can't make it without you.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus,
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; hallelujah."
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody cry out this morning.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody,
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; oh Jesus,
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; make that confession today. Yes,
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; you're back and you want to come back to
[2:02:54] God.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Why not do it today?
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; While the blood is running warm in your
[2:03:01] veins,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; the master is calling.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Come to Jesus.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Do it for somebody. Jesus.
[2:03:20] Do it for the children, Jesus.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Do it for those, oh God, that's at a
[2:03:25] crossroad.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Don't know where to turn.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come unto me."
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, you in a heavy lane with burden and
[2:03:37] I'll give you rest.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; You've been to
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; You've been tossing all night.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Come to Jesus.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; He's real.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:04:04] Somebody cry out this morning. Jesus.
[2:04:09] [Music]

[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:04:16] Thank you Lord.
[2:04:18] blessing our brother Lord.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Giving them courage,
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; faith, oh God, to come to you.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, you're the burden bearer.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus,
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; you're the way maker.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; You're the life changer.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; You're the heart fixer.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Do it for our brother right now.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Move in his life.

[2:04:49] Hallelujah.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed this morning to come to
[2:04:58] the Lord. Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; He said if you deny me, I deny you.
[2:05:02] Hallelujah.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; God wants to set you free.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; You don't have to leave and be the same.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Don't let it be played back one day.
[2:05:15] Hallelujah. that you heard the word.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; But you turned to death ear.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; But why is calling?
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Why there still blood on the mercy seat?
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Why you still set free?
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Why you still come? Come to Jesus right
[2:05:36] now. Hallelujah.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Yes God. Do it for right now.
[2:05:44] While on the other side
[2:05:49] calling
[2:05:52] Jesus
[2:05:54] do
[2:05:56] will not pass me by.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; The altar is always open.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; You want to come this morning?

[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. We got time to pray. Amen.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; We got time to get in the presence of
[2:06:17] God. Hallelujah.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; See what God can do in your life.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. He wants to change you this
[2:06:22] morning. He wants to do something real
[2:06:26] like that saying. It don't have to be
[2:06:28] the same.

[2:09:17] He's calling you this morning.
[2:09:19] Hallelujah.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Don't let him pass you by.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; This may be your last chance.
[2:09:26] Hallelujah. I don't know, but don't let
[2:09:29] him pass you by. while he's calling,
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; while his spirit is falling, while his
[2:09:36] presence is near. Oh Jesus, reach out
[2:09:40] and touch the Lord. Come on. Oh Jesus.
[2:09:44] Hallelujah. Thank you.
[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:09:50] Hallelujah.
[2:09:52] Hallelujah.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:59] I believe God want to do something.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; But what it takes
[2:10:06] takes you breaking past those barriers.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:10:12] You know how
[2:10:14] I thought about a testimony.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Glory. I was speaking with one of the
[2:10:20] boys I grew up with
[2:10:23] and I told him, I says, "Everybody
[2:10:24] thought I was crazy
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; when the Lord saved me.
[2:10:30] I said, "But one thing about it, sir."
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; We started going down the line
