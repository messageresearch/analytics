reads let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me you may be seated I'm going read a little further down you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go ye know and the way ye know Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh to the father unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have known you would known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and it suffices us and Jesus said unto him I have I mean have I been so long time with you and yet th has thou not known me Phillip he he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father may God to bless the reading of his word tonight by the grace of God tonight I I want to just speak to you for a moment on something that was on my heart uh for the last week or so and I ministered on it Sunday but I want to talk to you tonight about I am the way amen about I am the way you know it's something that's been on my heart I says that you know here in the scriptures very familiar we read it all the time but you know Jesus was telling them he's saying you know I don't want y' your hearts to be troubled you know he said you believe in God believe also in me I don't I don't want you to be troubled you know cuz you know in this life we have a lot of things that trouble you or a lot of things that you know if you live long enough take place in your life trouble's going to come but he says I don't want you to be troubled say cuz you believe in in God believe also in me you know in my father's house or my father's Kingdom there many palaces you know interpreted but either way he was talking to them about a place that he has he was going away and sometimes they was thinking it was a bad thing but he was going away he didn't know the whole purpose of his coming but he was going away and he was going to prepare a place for you and he says that if it were not so I would have told you you know and that's the thing about it God God God doesn't tell tell uh God isn't doesn't tell lies like men God doesn't make promises you know that he can't he can't uphold he don't do that you know we do that sometimes well you know you shouldn't do that but sometimes people do that they make promises and they can't hold they can't uphold those promises but one thing about Christ he he never make a promise that he can't keep never not one time all his promises he can uphold every one of his promises so you know and you think about that he says if it wasn't so I would have told you I want you to have comforted that that what I'm telling you is the truth what I where what I'm telling you I got prepared for you I want you to believe it come on and I don't want you to be troubled down here you know down here in this life like we say we down here be down here long enough you going to have troubles and things and but what what keeps you all messed up and all where you can't ever seem to get settled in your spirit is because sometimes this is where your treasure is so if this is where your treasure is this that's where your heart at this this is this is all you know like it says we don't sorrow as those that don't have hope this ain't this ain't the place we got all our confidence in now if we got all our confidence in this life we all upset we didn't achieve this thing I didn't get this what I want didn't get that I want always want this always want that so you gonna always this what because that's just where your hope is but you know it got to come into a place in your life where you release this ain't this is not what your your dreams and all are for come on we got goals and things don't get me wrong but this ain't the this ain't my my f if I don't I got goals but if I don't achieve that this is what I'm really living for this is all I'm you know we was talking to a a guy today at work he's in early and was telling them we was laughing about it I says you know I'm only 40 I says was telling them how fast time going and there another guy he's 60 something he says and ask him he says man he says he just talk about how fast time going but I told him I said you know uh he says I ain't trying to get no older and one guy tells him well every he said you can't help it every day you go to sleep you wake up you older you can't help it and I said every heartbeat is bringing bringing you closer to the Grave you can't help it he said man that's that's kind of scary it is to those that don't have no hope but to you and I who have hope we're not afraid of those things you know why because it's the same spirit that raised him from Christ from the dead if it dwell in you you got to believe that right come on that when you go on the ground you know like I was listening to the prophet of God talking about that the how they how they cloning the corn and all those things like that he saying that they look the same all that they look the same they everything you can't tell the difference taste the same but the only difference is you put it in the ground you bury it and it won't come back because it don't have that germ of life in it but you and I that's been born again that's the thing about it it this flesh deteriorates it goes down but but that Soul what God did in in that place that that nothing can't nothing can't uproot that shake that that's life in there amen come on so you you ain't worried about that that's the Eternal part that's why he says I'm going I got another body prepared for you anyway this right here is fading away all these things you know so we look this ain't Our Hope right our hope is in what Christ has for us and the thing is if you don't believe it you won't live that way you won't believe you you we can come to church hear it you're in and you're out but if you don't believe it you'll say Amen to it but you won't live that way you know y like somebody I believe they told Peter or once them said you're a Galilean somebody where where you from he said no but they say your speech betray you your your speech will betray you your life will betray you it'll show sometimes we say oh we people think you live this place think you live that way but sooner or later it's going to show because the life that's in you got to come out whatever's inside you can only wear a mask for so long it's got to come out that's why you know the thing is we you look at your life as an individual you say Lord search me heart my heart and try my Reigns The Deep things God I want you to uncover them come on and let and let God do that but a lot of times we don't want it it ain't that sometimes we're afraid to let God go into that deep place but we don't want to you don't you don't want to you know live right you don't want to live that life so you you love those things so as long as you love them you won't let God deal with them but it comes to a place that you know as I said even when the Lord first saved me I come to that I I knew I want I said God I I need you I love you I want to serve you but I'm afraid of myself I knew I was but what did I need I needed the Holy Ghost you know I was talking with uh several people this week but I was saying to to somebody I says you know I says do you want to be saved do you want to serve the Lord and they said yeah I want to but I'm afraid I might backslide I says but the thing is you living in yourself you will I says but that's why he knew you couldn't live the life he knew you could not Israel tried it they could not and he knew that they could not keep his statutes keep his he knew they couldn't do it he said that's why I'mma write it in their hearts God God would have to do something to the inner man that's why he says you know except a man be born again he can't he don't understand he won't see the kingdom he can't understand he got to be born again he might be around it here at all the time might seem like his you know mystified all that to him or seem like it's too deep or it might seem too simple whatever it is but until he's born again the Revelation breaks forth in his heart things change he see it oh I see it now I heard but I see now I you can't help but to live because I was telling someone I said you know you sometimes every might talk about the old Earnest and old things he did and all those things and I says yes I says and you know at one point you know those things used to bother you but they don't bother you no more because you know that that man you're not that man that man is dead that man died back there so it doesn't bother you you say how could I that that that's not me come on I've been born again that old that's the old man all things have become new I'm not afraid of backslid afraid of going back to that man you can't how because that man is dead and he can't come back Christ is now living inside of you the life and that's what it is you say you're not boasting I I can live this no you knew you couldn't do it you knew that he had to come and that's what I was sharing with a couple people this week I said that's what it is you can't you you got you do I says what he says unto you is to repent that's number one thing to repent repent be Godly Sorry God lord how when they heard this they were what pricked in their hearts conviction set in didn't it come on he says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now that was a promise that God made and that's why I say we go back to that God don't make promises that he can't keep he promised it so if you do what he says he's he he'll do his part he'll give the Holy Ghost to them that what obey him so it's not that like we was saying I know we was talking about it in the Bible study the other night but it had already been on my heart too you you hear sometimes when you praying for people they begging Lord please Lord please I want it but it's not that you got to beg God please it's a promise that he gave you so in that you're saying Lord this is what you promised I did my part now the devil come to your mind all this things but long as you know that you done your part you wait until he does his part cuz he's got to do his part because he made that promise and it ain't never fail come on that's the promise that God made I was sharing with somebody that uh two days ago and I shared also I said now the same promise he made about the Holy Ghost all his promises are the same he said the same thing about about healing didn't he with his stripes we were healed I'm the Lord thy God that he he said if you lay hands on the sick they what they shall recover any s any sick among you call for the elders ain't that what the Bible says that's a promise that he made and he can't break he he can't break his Pro he ain't going to never give out nothing he can't deliver on now the devil will keep you doubting or or or keep your mind jammed up to where that's the right word clogged up to where you you just can't have enough Faith to believe what God says so you so you don't believe it you won't act on it will you come on you don't if you don't believe that if you lay hands on the sick there recover you won't do it first thing you'll do is run jump run to the doctor won't you why because you don't believe it Hallelujah but when you get to believing it come on believing then what it is God God he never said nothing he deliver he want to show you that that I'm going keep my promises that I'm the Lord and I ain't change I'm just as real as I was then I'm just as real now because I am not was not shall be but I am the same Hallelujah and that's what it is so you know I say what it is Jesus said he said I'm the way you know I was thinking about that you know and and how you know they saying here Lord show us the father because you know looking at something the prophet of God was talking about how you know is always been in man's uh heart or desire for man to see God they always want to see him right always want to see God and sometimes people say oh you can't see or you see them and you see them and me whatever they they always wanted to see them right but it's something to how Jesus told them I've been switch you so long yet you still don't know who I am but that's what happens people can go to church maybe years and years and years and still hadn't seen him still don't know who he is still don't know where to find him at come on it happens don't it Hallelujah but I don't know about you I said but I want to see him I want to see him I want to know him not just only just in the letter but through through the power come on the power of the res I want I want to know him in the power and the fellowship of his suffering yeah you suffering but don't Suffer Without the power come on come come on if I'm going suffer I want to see the power to come on glory to God hallelujah but we find that you know I say that what happened he he said show show us it'll satisfy he said I've been so long a time with you you can you imagine Jesus been there and they still didn't know who he was still couldn't recognize still couldn't see him right but the Holy Ghost had to come to do what open their eyes then Peter can stand up and say that same one you crucified go he's now made both what Lord and Christ come on he was here the Messiah the Christ was here living among us walked among us but we didn't know who he was but now we know why because he came back just like he said and he's living in us and we got the power now Hallelujah well how can we get the power oh he had a we didn't he come on God gave a promise but I say what it is man always want to see him even Moses after the burning bushy experienced all the Miracles and all he still came to a place he said Lord I want to see your glory amen what more sometimes you say do you have to see for God to show you that he is who he said he is what more does he got to show you come on what more does he have to do for you to just take it and say Lord I believe it I don't got to see no you don't have to do nothing I believe your word and I'll take it just like that what what more does he have to do Miracles after Miracles come on I was reading the other day how you know uh David was talking about in Psalms and how you know they they cried for bread I gave them bread they cried for this I gave he said and they still still didn't believe me he says but you know while their mouth was filled I slew the fattest of them because they they still didn't believe all I did for them and what more does he have to do what more come on what what what more do we got to take him through Hallelujah but he said sure you know it's always been uh uh in in man's uh uh heart uh desire to see God you know and the thing is it it it took it took me back uh you know in my mind I says you know the prophet of God was talking about something else he was saying you know when when a person first get converted you know how you illuminated everything look good to you everything changes you're excited about everything so I you know start thinking about how you know even in my own personal life how the Lord he first saved you filled you with his Spirit you couldn't even get through chapters of the Bible because you reading and all of a sudden you stirb heart stirb you crying tears of joy you thanking the Lord for everything because you're so you couldn't wait to get in the house of prayer prayer was your main thing because that was that was your fellowship with God that was because you knew that on your knees God was going to meet you there you was praying to a god that spoke back to you Hallelujah you were looking for him to speak back wasn't you Hallelujah but what happened sometimes you say what happened just as man always you saying always desired to see God but in this hour it looks like the whole thing is reversed people don't look to see God no more do they I know say it like that but it it's not just not just out in the the world you looking at in the church they don't look to see God they ain't looking for him why sometimes could be because everything is so accessible and everything is so easy now right I was thinking to myself I said you know we know desperation bring God on the scene but what does what does God have to do for us to look for him again I said God I don't want that I want I'm looking for you every day God I'm looking for you you know I was praying to myself today I was saying and I've been doing this for a couple days now I said Lord I says I want to tell you thank you for everything you blessed me with I want to tell you thank you for blessing my wife to be healthy for blessing my children to be healthy I want to tell you thank you I said Lord I don't want for one moment and I know I said I know you don't but I don't want for one moment it to even look or appear like I ain't appreciative for what you're doing for me so God I know I told you already but I'm going tell you again Lord I Thank you I said I already know I told you but Lord I'm going say again I love you I I know I told but I'm going say it again Lord I Thank you for saving me you couldn't you didn't have to God I was saying just like that but Lord you did and I want to tell you thank you I want to show I appreciate you I'm glad you did Hallelujah and that's been in my heart and that's and that's sh and know somebody was telling saying something to me the other day and what it is I says you you you come to church and what happens you know the devil you got all the devil got all kind of things going on on the outside in our lives you like got all kind of things so you come in the house of God he'll put them all on your mind at once he'll tangle you all you get in the house of God you can't even you can't even worship God what you came to do because the devil follows you in here and he got in your mind tangle your mind all up right or or something maybe in your life or a situation that's come upon now and you can't praise God can't get all that he wants to get out of you because you Bound by circumstances you bound you Bound by situations and demon powers come on that's only the hell cap held you captive in your mind because Christ has made you free already it's only the devil that got your mind tangled up I said so what I want want you to do is what I want you to do when the Devil comes in your mind I want you to throw both hands up and say Lord thank you thank you for Joy thank you for peace thank you for saving me I said just throw both hands up and start worshiping God Flip Flip it around on the devil and see what happened come on I said you don't have to sit and listen to what the devil is saying I said I I told them that's what the problem is we sit back and we listen to what the devil's saying I said you know Eve the devil came Satan came under her and says uh hey he God said she didn't have to stop to listen to what the devil says you don't I mean you don't have to tell us what God said we know what God says but when she stopped to listen to him didn't she and he did what walked right into her mind got her all tangled up you know but that's why I says you know we you don't have to stop I know God is good I know God Is A Healer I know God saved me I know God filled me with his spirit I I know who God I know come on I don't have to sit there and think about worry about con up in my I know what God has done hallelujah look around and see what God has done I know where God has brought me from I know how God has kept me I know how God has watched over I know that God is still a Healer I know hallelujah oh yes like Joe Joe sitting there you know he's talking about him on the ass he but he stood up and said yeah when the Revelation h I know I know he lives I know I don't have to I know I'm suffer I'm going through I know even in that I still know something changes then hallelujah it nothing nothing will be able to shake that's why I was saying that's what it is you got to get that anchor down in the soul come on it's got to be more than just on the flesh or just in the spirit feel up you can't be that way up day down you got to get that anchor down in the soul I don't feel like it but I know all is well I don't feel like it but I'm still going to press anyhow I don't feel like it but I know I can make it because the anchor is there something is holding me it won't let me go and I know what it is it's God that's what it is hallelujah but that's what that's what it says you know Jesus said and and that you know and I I said sometimes you can't explain it but I said that's what it is it's more than just a jump and a shout Church affiliation all that you got to get you got to get the Holy Spirit down Holy Ghost down in your soul he got to come in it's got to be real can't be put on cuz it ain't it ain't going to happen it ain't going to work it's got to be real he's real it's got to be real it's got to be the Life of Christ in you come on somebody says they spoke in tongues we know how that go don't we that's good all those things are good but what what what's the fruit the life come on I I was saying to myself I was telling some somebody this other cuz I've been witnessing just about every day but I says you know thing is we put everybody in heaven we do I says but the thing is you know you can't I Shar somebody you can't live any kind of way and expect Jesus talk about this place and expect to go there you can't you can't live any kind of way and get there cuz remember talked about that place and yet they asked him they says we don't know where you're going how we going how we going to know how to get there he told them how to get there didn't he he says I am the way right I am the way who is he he is the word ain't he come on I remember reading in the scriptures how I think it was uh St John 5 but Jesus was talking to them he says search the scriptures he was talking to the church search the scriptures the people the Pharisees and the scribes of that day search the scriptures right for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that what testify of me come on he said you don't you don't got love in your hearts come on but what it was he was showing them that if you really had it then youd know who I was he said if you don't even if you don't believe what I'm saying he said believe it for the what very uh work sake come on but they couldn't could they oh Jesus but I says what it is I thank God uh the life I I says what it is I thank God for the life that's what I I I thank God I said Lord I Thank you for the life things you can't you can't explain that God just start moving revealing opening things to you you can't explain how it just all started coming together what it was it was his spirit that done those things and you can't explain that some people say I explain try to do this right here but no what it is something happened amen or something took place and it's still taking place it's still changing you still you still seeing things Hallelujah that you can't explain but you seeing it you walking in it you fellowship and communion with God everybody else going around talking having conversation they don't know where you at Hallelujah on the job and things but in your something happening to you God speaking to you oh yeah I thank God for that cuz I said Lord I Thank You Lord whatever you're saying just help me to be receptive to it help me to yield that's how I said Lord I just want to yield to it sometime we want to oh I God got gave me a gift I want to show it out to everybody come on that's not the way is it come on you got to get out the way and let God do it come on God want to use you but you got to let God use you you got to let that flesh die get out of the way let God do what he want it's no not you but you it's God doing it that's what you say Lord I want I want you to take complete Lord I just want you not me I want you to be glorified I want you to be lifted up I want people to see you in my mouth let me glorify you let me talk of you Hallelujah and I believe that but I say what it is you know today seem like things have changed the word they ain't look people ain't looking for God they ain't Desiring to see him as you know maybe we can say it used to be but it's still those individuals that's why I says it can't be I sh somebody is not you know you got to you got to realize Jesus said I'm the way Mom and Daddy ain't the way the church ain't the way Jesus said I am the way you can't you can't ride off somebody else salvation you can't ride off this one experence or that one because I know you know yes they might have they might have lived good and they might have been filled with the Holy Ghost and they might have made it but you as an individual got to come and meet God for yourself you got to come down that lonely road that straight and that narrow way come on but if the desire is in your heart don't worry about whether you will make it or not let go to that desire God will come in I know he will come on sometimes you know and that's the thing God makes God makes his own way you don't we can't fig God makes his own way you know can you imagine in the in the in the face of the mountains on the side of you on Army behind you and Red Sea in front of you we crying how we going to get out of it God makes his own way don't he God makes his own way he LS you there he'll make his own God does it I was thinking about brother Gordon just know with the job and things we talking about our job situation God will make his own way he put your places he know how to fix it don't worry about it come on why cry speak God going to make it his own way wa it God make his own way I seen it I says even you know you go back to that part that's what you got to from the beginning got to be right you can't build a house and the foundation ain't right it might last a year or two whatever but when that hurricane come when those winds blow no rains fall hard enough if it the foundation ain't right it's going to show up sooner or later it might last 10 years but if it ain't been poured right or sitting on his pillar right erosion going to happen going to start eating away at it earthquakes hit cracks going to come in the foundation why cuz it wasn't built right from the very beginning the beautiful house but it's about to fall why because the foundation wasn't right that's the thing always in my heart from even from the beginning from the very beginning I said Lord I want to get it right come on you know what happens when when when when God when when God is doing it it it hurts because you got a lot of baggage you got a lot of things that ain't right come on so God got to clean you up don't he come on take that glass out the mud he got to clean you up he got to get things out of you and it hurt cuz sometimes you might look at it God wants you to separate God wants you to move yourself God wants you to do this God want and it hurts sometimes God that's my my friend my mama all the things but God say separate yourself and I'm going bless you ain't that what he told Abraham the blessing came after separation oh it's lonely it hurts sometimes the preacher seem like he always preaching on you I was sharing with them Sunday I say it often times especially when I first the Lord first saved me every Sunday seemed like Brother s is preaching on me every Sunday but you know what I was receiving it amen what it was he wasn't preaching on me probably know half of what you had going on but it was the Holy Ghost picking those things out to do what it was the pot Hallelujah molding you but you had to receive it Hallelujah and cuz Lord I need you right God I need what I need what you got I need it so Lord if you saying that you saying I am the way come on Lord show me the way I'm not going you you know a lot of times people say I was sharing someone this the other day I said okay people going to talk about you know the Holy Ghost the evidence of it you know all these signs and gifts and all those things I said I know one thing if you can't receive the word it's a problem it's a problem I was telling them that the other day I said because who is he who is he says I am the way who is he come on I said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God you go down a little bit says in the word was made what flesh and dwelt Among Us right he is the word you can't have him and have the and reject the word it ain't happening come on but to have him you receive it cuz the life in you is crying out for that water Hallelujah that's what I need to quench my thirst and I'm hearing it oh Jesus come on God is so good I don't want to be long long tonight but I feel like I just started God is so good come on he says I am the way come on I said I said to somebody the other day you know you can't live any kind of way he says I am the way but what it is we want to do all we want to have it our own way we want to want to always do our own way you know I I I was running the scriptures by grace of God God was showing me some stuff I say even Cain Cain didn't want to do it he want to do it his own way and and he even God told him if you do like your brother he says I'll receive you but he he wanted to do he wanted his own way he didn't want the way for that day he wanted his own way he and he reject and refuted so much to where he was willing to kill his own brother jealous of the blessings of God but all he was doing was what God required of that time and he was getting the blessings but his brother was jealous of him wasn't he Hallelujah huah but I says it's always don't want to do we'll do make our own way do our own way but he says what I am the way you might have a way like like they sing a little song you know he says You must come in at the door God's got a way that you can't go under it's got a way that you can't go around you must come in where at the door [Applause] amen God always has a provided way for every age and

sins of the world recognize what God has done amen Jesus Christ has been crucified amen and the prophet of God say he's crucified the second time praise God the word itself that comes to us the people have rejected that are you with me but I thank God that there are people that recognize that Jesus Christ has provided a way for us this day and he's called the people out from Creeds and dogas of men and call them back to the word that's the reason he died to bring us back Amen to restore us back that Fallen nature that sinful nature God blood sheded amen that that life that was in that blood can come back on the believer are you with me that I said that was the life of God God himself amen made himself a body and the blood was the blood of the God are you with me you say God can't believe God
