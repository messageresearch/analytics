[40:10] in a special way
[40:12] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[40:16] Romans 8 chapter 27 verse
[40:21] we stand for the reading of the word God
[40:23] is good amen
[40:28] there's nobody like you Lord amen
[40:31] nobody like you Lord
[40:34] and he that searches the heart
[40:38] knows what is the mind of the spirit
[40:41] because he make it intercession for the
[40:45] Saints
[40:47] according to
[40:50] the will of God
[40:54] and we know that all things work it
[40:57] together for good
[40:59] to them to love God
[41:02] to them who are the called according to
[41:04] his purpose
[41:06] for whom it did for no he also did
[41:09] predestinate
[41:11] to be conformed to the image of his son
[41:16] that he might be the firstborn among
[41:20] many brethren
[41:22] well over whom he did predestinate then
[41:24] he also called
[41:27] and whom he called them he also
[41:30] Justified
[41:32] and whom he justified them he also
[41:37] glorified
[41:39] what shall we say then
[41:42] what shall we then say to these things
[41:47] if God be for us
[41:50] who can be against us
[41:54] he that spares not his own son but
[41:56] delivered him up
[41:58] for us all
[42:00] how shall he
[42:03] not with him also freely give us what
[42:07] all things God bless the read his words
[42:10] you may be seated
[42:15] this morning I like to
[42:18] use it for familiar topic if God be for
[42:22] us
[42:25] if God be for us
[42:28] in many occasions in the Bible
[42:31] we can pick out
[42:35] several characters in The Bible but
[42:38] we just want to do a few
[42:41] and hope that your situation would
[42:44] relate
[42:45] to some of these that
[42:49] characters
[42:51] because the Bible says there's no
[42:53] temptation taking us
[42:55] but such is common to man
[42:59] but God will with the Temptation make a
[43:02] way of Escape
[43:04] so I'm saying to you
[43:07] sometimes we have to identify that
[43:10] will not the only ones
[43:13] that have gone through problems and
[43:16] situations
[43:20] the Bible tells us there's nothing new
[43:23] on the Sun
[43:25] so we can be encouraged by
[43:28] amen these ones that had their trials
[43:33] and their tribulations
[43:35] they had to go through things but
[43:39] one thing about it
[43:42] they knew that God was with them
[43:46] one thing we must be confident in that
[43:50] doesn't matter or what we go through
[43:56] we understand that he said I'll never
[43:59] will leave you
[44:03] and I never will forsake you
[44:07] amen you're not in it alone you're not
[44:10] in it by yourself
[44:14] you're not alone because sometimes it
[44:17] seem as though we're in it by ourselves
[44:22] and we feel like a man that amen where
[44:26] is God at my trying times
[44:31] and when trouble is all around where is
[44:34] God
[44:36] if he said I'll never leave your God is
[44:40] still there
[44:44] amen sometimes we go through things and
[44:47] amen we we think that God has forsaken
[44:50] us
[44:52] but God hasn't forsaken us
[44:55] amen he's still with us no matter what
[44:59] we go through God is still there
[45:02] praise God one thing another I know that
[45:05] he's my Lord
[45:07] and he's my God
[45:10] he's my savior
[45:12] and I'm not going to doubt him
[45:17] so uh
[45:19] I I thought uh two characters this
[45:22] morning as I was praying and I thought
[45:26] about the story of Esther
[45:30] Esther had
[45:33] I said she was God's secret weapon
[45:39] yes there was a secret
[45:43] amen that was hid
[45:46] someone in the enemy camp
[45:50] sometimes amen God to place you in
[45:53] places you don't know how you got there
[45:56] and why you are there
[46:03] Mordecai Esther uncles told her
[46:07] amen when the King was looking for
[46:10] somebody to replace
[46:12] amen uh
[46:15] VyStar
[46:17] the queen and he was looking for
[46:20] somebody
[46:22] and he was looking throughout the
[46:23] kingdom trying to find
[46:26] amen a a queen
[46:30] knowing that
[46:32] Esther was a Jew amen Mordecai told her
[46:36] to say Amen
[46:39] another name
[46:42] because
[46:44] not knowing what was up ahead and the
[46:48] King chose asked him to be his Queen
[46:52] you know somewhat will in captivity and
[46:55] Australian land sometimes
[46:58] being in the strange in a land a man of
[47:02] captivity and a Strange Land and you
[47:05] find yourself there
[47:08] victims of circumstances that beyond
[47:12] your control
[47:17] we understand that the Bible said be not
[47:20] uneekly yoked together with unbelievers
[47:24] but yet this Jewish young girl
[47:28] find herself
[47:30] in a situation in a great dilemma
[47:34] somehow we would say the instructions of
[47:37] our uncle amen wasn't good instructions
[47:41] to tell her amen
[47:44] to be a man of favor and become a amen
[47:49] Queen
[47:49] [Music]
[47:57] sometimes we don't know how God is
[48:01] maneuvering and how God is moving
[48:06] so sometimes we try to exchange before
[48:08] the time
[48:11] we already have made our opinion
[48:15] sometimes we judge people's lives amen
[48:19] by what we see exterior not knowing that
[48:23] God has an interior motive
[48:26] God won't achieve something that amen
[48:30] beyond your comprehension in your
[48:32] spirituality
[48:35] you might be so spiritual and so amen
[48:39] good with the letter of the word not
[48:41] knowing amen that God has a plan amen
[48:45] that beyond your comprehension
[48:49] sometimes we don't know amen while we
[48:53] move in certain directions
[48:56] we don't understand ourselves why we
[48:59] move like that
[49:01] God has a plan
[49:04] amen God knows them that are his
[49:09] and God knows how to deliver The Godly
[49:12] out of Temptation
[49:16] the Bible tells this is not him that
[49:19] will it
[49:20] nor him that run it
[49:23] but God that shows the mercy
[49:26] amen praise God God is in control when
[49:30] you think that amen all things are out
[49:34] of control God's still in control
[49:38] when you think that your life is a mess
[49:42] and you think that our hope is lost God
[49:46] is still in control
[49:50] he's still in control
[49:53] amen hallelujah
[49:55] God knows when to stop ends
[50:00] praise God and God knows when the time
[50:03] comes
[50:06] amen that you would recognize your
[50:09] purpose
[50:12] God knows when that time comes
[50:17] that you'll come to your season
[50:22] and your reason for living
[50:26] for God has a season
[50:29] a time that he has appointed
[50:34] our steps and nominal bounds we cannot
[50:37] pass
[50:41] your season your time and your reason
[50:46] for living
[50:50] you may not be walking in your season
[50:55] and in your purpose
[50:58] you might not understand the fullness
[51:02] of why you're here
[51:04] and what God expectation is of you
[51:10] you may not understand how God will use
[51:13] you
[51:16] and how God Amen looks on you
[51:22] even when you're in a place that's
[51:26] seem to be safe
[51:29] you're in an uncomfortable
[51:32] place
[51:34] you may not say that this is a an
[51:37] orthodox please shy I don't understand
[51:41] my purpose I I don't understand but I'm
[51:45] going through the motion
[51:47] I've tried to deal with life
[51:49] I'm trying to make the best of it
[51:53] because I hadn't fully come into amen my
[51:58] purpose my destiny has not been revealed
[52:02] to me as of yet
[52:04] amen how God will amen white things to
[52:08] my good
[52:10] Ness how God will even calls him that
[52:14] his glory to shine
[52:17] and his purpose to be made manifested
[52:21] I don't understand how it's going to
[52:23] happen
[52:25] but somehow amen
[52:28] little old me insufficient
[52:32] little old girl like Esther
[52:35] young lady
[52:37] out of all
[52:40] the Young
[52:43] virgins in
[52:46] the kingdom God chose her
[52:51] the king chose Esther
[52:56] but her uncle
[52:58] which was the Jew Mordecai it was
[53:01] one that
[53:05] understood who he was
[53:09] understood who is God
[53:13] understood that he was a Jew you must
[53:16] understand who you are
[53:20] praise God understand who your father is
[53:25] Hallelujah I understand that I have a
[53:28] question
[53:30] I understand my father is God
[53:35] the true and the Living God
[53:38] so he understood that mordecaiyan
[53:41] when Haman one of the closest advises to
[53:44] the king
[53:45] he wanted all the people to recognize
[53:49] his authority and who he was
[53:53] you know how it is
[53:55] folks get a little position
[53:58] then they get Amen to a little pride and
[54:02] they wanted everybody to look up to him
[54:05] and give him uh uh you know honor him
[54:10] respect him bow down to him
[54:14] the devil would have you to bow down to
[54:17] his demon forces
[54:20] the devil wants you to bow down unto the
[54:24] Demons of of immorality
[54:28] the Demons of homogene and in line and
[54:31] stealing and cheating
[54:33] the devil would have you to bow down to
[54:37] drugs and alcohol and oh all kind of
[54:40] devices of the enemy he would have you
[54:43] to bow down and if you don't bow down
[54:47] he's upset with you
[54:53] yeah yeah but we'll have the young
[54:54] ladies to strip off their clothes and
[54:57] reveal the secret parts of their body
[55:01] the devil will have the young men it
[55:04] meant to be act like amen animals and
[55:07] dogs as brother Nathan said the other
[55:10] night
[55:13] running from one place to another just
[55:17] so Amen to the dog she called
[55:24] you're not called to be a dog
[55:27] they've been running like you don't know
[55:30] who you are
[55:31] the Son of God as the daughter of God
[55:34] you have a standard to keep
[55:39] amen God chose you to be holy
[55:43] amen God chose you to live holy
[55:46] God chose you to walk holy
[55:49] amen I know we're living in a world of
[55:52] chaos and confusion and praise God and I
[55:56] know the powers of the enemy has amen
[55:59] confronted you
[56:01] well how are you going to resist the
[56:04] devil
[56:08] Mordecai made in his mind
[56:11] I don't care how many demons or devils
[56:15] I'm not bowing down to Haman
[56:19] are you with me
[56:22] examine your life examine your situation
[56:25] and you might understand that you also
[56:29] are confronted with your Haman
[56:34] your Haman may not be a matter of
[56:37] physical and division it might be an
[56:41] individual that is physical that is
[56:44] coming against you in your life
[56:47] and your family
[56:50] your hand on your facing
[56:55] I don't know what you were facing but
[56:57] God knows that you haven't Haman that
[57:01] you must
[57:02] face and you must stand bold
[57:05] and confidence knowing
[57:08] that if God be for us
[57:12] are you a man
[57:14] of God before
[57:18] Hallelujah
[57:19] I'm not worried about him
[57:22] amen because it's God it's for us amen
[57:27] oh
[57:29] so the challenge was
[57:31] when he could not
[57:35] [Music]
[57:38] amen he was devised in the scheme
[57:41] whereby he might destroy not only
[57:44] Mordecai but all the folks that amen are
[57:49] that were like Mordecai all the Jews I
[57:53] want them all dead
[57:55] the devil just don't want you dead he
[57:58] wants your children he wants your family
[58:00] he wants everything
[58:04] that pertaining to you
[58:07] are you up there
[58:09] when you choose to stand against him he
[58:12] wants to destroy everything
[58:15] are you up man
[58:16] so the devil is not just upset with you
[58:20] he's upset with your children
[58:23] that's why mothers and the fathers have
[58:26] to stand in the gap for their children
[58:27] because job had to stand in the gap for
[58:30] his
[58:32] are you with me
[58:33] Jesus stood in the gap for you and I
[58:37] and he prayed
[58:41] he'd expand not his own son but
[58:44] delivered him up for us
[58:47] are you with me
[58:50] Hallelujah
[58:53] I'm telling you this morning

[1:19:28] fasting is a sacrifice that you're
[1:19:30] making
[1:19:31] the most sacrifice you make towards God
[1:19:34] the middle God bless you
[1:19:36] you know I've had people that say well
[1:19:40] that had you know a good job and made
[1:19:43] plenty of money
[1:19:45] and the more money they made the more
[1:19:47] sacrifices they made
[1:19:49] they just didn't pay attempt for their
[1:19:51] tithes they paid maybe 15 sometimes 20
[1:19:55] percent
[1:19:57] I said why are you doing that
[1:19:58] he said God blessed me
[1:20:01] and I said oh you don't have to do that
[1:20:04] you tell people they don't have to do it
[1:20:05] and they say well I'm doing I'm doing
[1:20:08] what I feel led to do the more God bless
[1:20:10] them the more they gave
[1:20:13] me
[1:20:15] you have people struggling just to do
[1:20:17] what they're supposed to do
[1:20:19] but there's some people that want to go
[1:20:22] over
[1:20:24] and you know you see all the doors and
[1:20:26] the wonders of Heaven open you see how
[1:20:28] they just bless bless them Beyond merger

[1:21:01] there's something hold on there and it
[1:21:03] don't stick it
[1:21:05] even the devil can't get in
[1:21:11] because they go out in the devil you
[1:21:13] ain't getting none of this or not
[1:21:15] they can't even join together
[1:21:19] you know
[1:21:21] because they all alone and everything
[1:21:24] I ain't giving the devil noise
[1:21:29] don't know the devil went in the whole
[1:21:31] time
[1:21:33] the devil just went in to get Victory
[1:21:35] because they so tight
[1:21:38] the more blessed the word
[1:21:41] give than it is the world
[1:21:44] I don't know where that comes from maybe
[1:21:45] God want to bless somebody isn't that
[1:21:47] right
[1:21:48] and I I okay I'm closing I said that
[1:21:51] didn't I said that
[1:21:53] and uh I won't not only y'all to do it
[1:21:56] but my maiden I want everybody to get on
[1:21:59] one of the car
[1:22:01] you know I think if somebody ever just a
[1:22:05] group of them said well I ain't fast
[1:22:10] I can't fast I get hungry too quick
[1:22:16] but I believe that everybody got a one
[1:22:18] Accord
[1:22:20] you know when it's time for dinner would
[1:22:22] be destroyed the king got inside closed
[1:22:24] in ashes and he called the whole Kingdom
[1:22:26] to fast some folks said you know I got
[1:22:28] high blood pressure and you know I got
[1:22:30] diabetes I came fast
[1:22:32] I believe when it came a time of life
[1:22:34] and death situation I believe forgot
[1:22:37] about everything because I'm gonna die
[1:22:40] so if I perish
[1:22:44] see it it comes a time of desperation in
[1:22:47] your life it comes a time when
[1:22:49] sacrifices have preeminence it come a
[1:22:52] time when you go beyond the means amen
[1:22:54] it come a time in your life I'm not
[1:22:56] telling somebody say well amen don't
[1:22:58] take your medicine don't do this I'm not
[1:23:00] telling you that but it comes a time in
[1:23:01] life that amen it becomes a desperation
[1:23:04] and a desperate situation
[1:23:07] I'm just telling you to do what you can
[1:23:09] do why you're able to do it
[1:23:12] are you up there
[1:23:14] do what you can do while you're able to
[1:23:16] do it
[1:23:17] because one time sometimes you're gonna
[1:23:20] want to do it and you ain't gonna be
[1:23:21] able to do it
[1:23:22] well while you're able to do it do what
[1:23:24] you can do
[1:23:26] but we need to be on one Accord
[1:23:29] they were all on one Accord
[1:23:31] and so will I go into the king
[1:23:36] uh which is not according to the law
[1:23:41] it's a situation
[1:23:43] where I could lose
[1:23:46] my life I can lose
[1:23:48] the throne
[1:23:50] but she made her that what I'm getting
[1:23:54] ready to do for my people to
[1:23:56] that I'm getting ready to make this
[1:23:59] sacrifice
[1:24:00] this is the point of desperation
[1:24:03] you got to see how bad do I the need in
[1:24:07] your life how desperate can I get
[1:24:10] how desperate can I get
[1:24:13] that I want to get the victory over this
[1:24:16] Haven
[1:24:18] this devil that's threatened to kill me
[1:24:21] destroyed me I see what he's want
[1:24:23] purpose to do not only to me but my
[1:24:26] family
