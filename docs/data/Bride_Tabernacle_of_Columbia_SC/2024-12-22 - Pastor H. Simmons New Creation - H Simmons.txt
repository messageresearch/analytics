bless every heart meet every need and bless your word word today and speak to our hearts in Jesus Christ's name amen we thank God the book of uh 1 Corinthians 15 God is good amen 1 Corinthians 15 and 20 1 Corinthians 15 and 20 amen God is good amen time is late he said but now in Christ now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for Since By Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the dead as in Adam all died even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the first fruit afterward they that are Christ at is coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father when he shall have put down all rules and all authority and power for he must Reign till he has put all enemies under his feet and The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is there God bless to read this word you may be seated want to talk about a new creation we understand this is around where day the world want to call uh uh the birth of Jesus Christ the birth of the Son of God and uh it's around that time and it's people love to give gifts and different things and people are nice around that time Merry Christmas hallelujah thank you Jesus you can be nice and smile so we don't want to stop stop people for smiling but we know that you know that Rome adopted this 25th day of December and it came in as the son got birthday and and it's actually Christ mass or whatever but that's all right you know uh to most people it's just a tradition anyway it's just like Thanksgiving having a turkey so by the grace of God I'm not going to bother the people amen they feel good so by the grace of God just know the truth the Bible say you should know the truth and the truth to make you free amen so by the grace of God we want to talk about this new creation because the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his uh uh the mother Mary was espoused to a man called Joseph before they came together she was found with the child amen and the Holy Ghost amen had overshadowed Mary and God had spoke Gabriel had spoke spoke to Mary about having a child and and she wanted to know how can this thing be saying that I don't know a man amen so the child was to be born it was only fulfill what God told uh Eve When sin came in and the serpent he told her that thou seed amen is going to Bruises the heel and her seed is going to bruise the head of the serpent are you with me so there was going to be two seeds the serpent seed and the woman's seed and we realize that a female does not have the seed so we realize that uh Christ was a seed that he was speaking of a virgin shall conceed so as we had on Sunday school this morning that Eve the serpent got to Eve before Adam are you with me and we understand that before Joseph got to Mary she was F with the child of the Holy Ghost are you with me amen y'all with me so by the grace of God we see the contrast amen so as we look at the 40 uh second verse of this 15th chapter uh let's just look at it for a moment it says for also is the resurrection of the Dead is swn in corruption it is raised Incorruptible amen and then he says it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown the Natural Body it is risen a spiritual body there's a natural body and there's a spiritual body and so it is written the first Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit so we want to talk about the natural man and the spiritual man so when we talk about the new creation amen we find that Adam amen was uh of the first creation and the first Adam amen the bought for children amen but that we understand that Satan had corrupted the first man so we understand that that creation was a a a corruptible but the last Adam which was Christ was to bring forth a new creation a new generation amen amen amen a a a people that wasn't subject to sin amen sin would not have dominion over this new creation amen yes you you you you become new creatures amen so when we talk about the new creation Now all this world if without Christ all you got to look forward to is to die am is no if and a man that is vulnerable a woman a few days full of trouble without Jesus Christ all you got to look forward to him is dy amen but if you got Jesus Christ amen you got eternal life amen so the the first Adam Amen in Adam the first Adam all died amen everyone died died in the first atom so if you were born of a woman amen all you had to look forward to is trouble and dying amen are you with me amen but this new creation Now who want all I mean you live uh uh maybe uh 50 60 years some people live 20 years some people live 10 years some people live 90 years but all you got to L is look forward to one day you going to die one day you going to die but the new creation we're not looking forward we cannot die the Bible said we should not all what sleep all the new creation does not die but they sleep amen are you with me because they go to sleep because one day God going to wake them up amen yes amen are you with me amen so you're looking forward amen you sleep but you're going to be woke up amen amen amen hallelujah amen oh yes that's going to be amen a awaking of the Dead amen them that sleep in Christ amen amen will God bring with them amen amen we they're going to get up out to grie or wherever they are amen if they sleeping in Christ amen they got something to look forward to amen but well no no so this new creation this child that was born this one that was come forth in the world it was coming to what uh uh what Adam lost it was coming to redeem it all by amen so you see where the sin took place dealing with the seed of the serpent in the seed of the woman are you with me so it it it it it it it comes to amen uh uh Deliver Us from what took place in the garden amen amen and to bring us back to a New Creation we saw was there was no sin everything God made was good amen amen so when sin came in death came in amen pain and sorrow came in amen all of that that's all you had to look forward to dying amen and that's why Paul said if if in this world we only have hope I'm all men most miserable amen people are miserable cuz that's all it got amen why you think people so miserable that's all it got this is little life here there a few days they visible they they have no meaning because I'm not here but a few days I ain't got nothing to live for miserable so people don't know what to do with life because amen they don't see the essence of it if I work I get a nice car if I work I get a nice house if I work amen I got a little money in the bank if I work hard amen and then sometimes things happen you may get sick lose your house lose your car lose everything you got then you say oh goodness I worked so hard to get it and I lost it all overnight you see what I'm saying but it's not about Christ amen you don't have to lose anything amen amen all that you accumulate in Christ amen is reserved in heaven for you amen hallelujah amen I have amen I I I I have a mansion amen I have a house not made with hand I have something amen that I can put my confidence in amen amen of this Earthly House of this Tabernacle this one be I have a house yes amen praise God that's why he said don't let your heart be troubled amen I'll be troubled but it's a new creation yes yes one day a baby was born amen but this baby was not like all other babies amen this baby was amen born amen Angels Came and Shepherds came and they recognized amen oh Hallelujah something was taking place they saw his star amen praise God a king was being born amen but nevertheless he said my kingdom am is not of this world am amen praise God I didn't come amen amen to to to restore this Kingdom right now but the kingdom the that I'm talking about John said repent because the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen we were talking about the Kingdom of Heaven th King amen Paul said are you the king of the Jews amen he said I'm not worried about this one right now amen if my kingdom was of this world my servant would fight for me amen God Amen he has power amen you got no power to take my life I Lay My Life down but I got power to take it up again this baby wasn't like no other baby this child was a holy child he didn't know no sin neither was God found in his mouth this was a different kind of child Hallelujah this was word Bor hallelujah hallelujah amen where had come to restore this was child was to be the Redeemer amen this
