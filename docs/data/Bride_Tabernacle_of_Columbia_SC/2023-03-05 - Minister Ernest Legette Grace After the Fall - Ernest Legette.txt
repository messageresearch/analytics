amen we want to look at Romans 5 by God's grace Romans 5 and 1. try not to keep you long amen God is so good ain't he the more that hour approaches and the darker hour gets that's the moral goodness of God well you see I like that that little song says I have lived in the goodness of God you know God has kept us ain't he kept us up under his arms he might not always give us what he wanted but what we wanted but he always supplied all our needs hasn't he it's not one time that God has ever failed as he Romans 5 and 1. you got to say Amen and it reads therefore being justified by faith we have what y'all want peace this morning he says being justified by faith you have what don't you thank God for peace this morning come on peace like a real amen somebody said I couldn't sleep last night with a peace of God come on I'll let you go on to sleep won't it come on peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated by whom we also have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulations worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope make him not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely a righteous man will one die but yet prayer Venture for a good man someone even dare to die but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet what sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from the Wrath through him for if we when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have received the atonement wherefore as by one man enter into the world death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law of sin was until the Law's sin was in the world but sin was not imputed where there is no law nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the sellitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come but not as offense so also as the free gift forever through the offense of one man a one minute one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift of by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abound unto many and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many is of many offenses unto justification for if one or by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all the to come into condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for by one man Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered enter that the offense might abound but where sin abound Grace did much more about him that is sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord may God it'll bless you the reading of his word this morning by God's grace that's what I want to talk to you about is Grace this morning amen about Grace you know and I've just been in this area for the last couple of weeks now talking about Grace you know and I know we had been ministering for a while there on on the fall of Man and how man being in this Fallen state but now today I want to talk about Grace after the fall amen and how you know man had fallen yes but God had a plan to get man back to that state or where he had fallen from and that state wouldn't be uh through works or any good that that man can do but that that state I mean that that place that God would get him back to would be only by his grace only by the grace of God you would be able to obtain the things where where God has the blessings that God has for you the only way only way you'll be able to obtain that Perfection or get back to the Tree of Life Hallelujah that Adam and them had got banished from would only be by the grace of God you know when man sinned and man should die right but it's only one way he was going to get back and that was gonna only be by what Grace come on God was going to do something for you that you didn't even deserve that you wasn't even worthy of it and by not by by you were born by by Nature you were what the children of Ralph came out the womb already like it says Born Ready to Die ready to go to the Judgment from the womb right but God by his grace he says I'm going to do something for him Hallelujah that's gonna override the way they were born come on but they got to receive it what I'm talking about and what is it that's that grace of God so that's what Paul kept talking about just here this morning in our reading Paul was talking about the gift of Grace he kept making no note of it when he talked about Grace he didn't say something that you can work towards but he kept saying the gift of Grace come on this is a gift that God has given you you know a gift you can't work for a gift can you somebody says I'm gonna give you this gift but all you got to do is give me ten dollars for it but that ain't no gift then is it you bought it did you come on but a gift is something that somebody given to you freely I know you don't deserve it you ain't you couldn't work hard enough to achieve it you couldn't live good enough to obtain it but I love you so much I'm gonna give it to you anyway Hallelujah and you know the devil don't like that does he he don't like when God just blesses a man because you know he's up there before the throne accusing the brother and all day long ain't he but when God looks down on him he says he don't even see it why because he's looking through them through the eyes of the blood what what the devil want to accuse you of and all these things don't you know that the blood of Jesus already taken care of it it's my grace that's sufficient for him Hallelujah you know what the devil want to do a man find all the time want to give his life to God and in his heart he want to come but what the devil does he likes to hang something over his head don't he remember what you did last night remember what you did the last week and all these things and remember you did this and you did that and if that man don't be mine for the devil or keep them Bound in Chains he come in the house of God and he can't even lift his hands and say thank you because the devil is hanging something over his head but if he would only get a revelation to what the grace of God is that before I even did those things God already knew it when I was dead and trespassing sin in due time when I was without strength Christ died for the ungodly God said me hallelujah oh Jesus come on God is so good this morning you know I'm stirred because I was in that place once where the devil had things hanging over me and I felt like when I come in the house of God and you know the worship was going forth I wanted to lift my hands but I couldn't lift my hands I want to say Amen but I couldn't say Amen because the devil had something over my head but it's something about that little Revelation when it came forth that before you even did those things God already knew you was going to do them and before the foundation of the world God already had you in his mind the lamb was already slain God had already made a way of Escape for you all you got to do is accept what God has done for you Lord I believe it Lord God I'm thankful Lord I'm glad that you died for me Lord hallelujah then you can be free to worship the Living God you know it feels good when you can worship God Amen feels good when you can come in the house of the Lord and lift your hands when you can say thank you Lord hallelujah when you can Testify the goodness of God come on how people can talk about what you're used to doing then you can say but God hallelujah but God who was what rich in Mercy we all walk that way but God who was rich in Mercy in due time when I was walking that way God had a sacrifice already made for me I'm so glad that He Paid a Debt that he didn't know I owe the debt that I couldn't pay but he went the distance from me and he paid the price and I'm so glad that God paid the price that's why I can stand before you today because of the price that was paid for me Hallelujah oh Jesus come on it's only by what the grace of God ain't it come on I like how Paul says I am that I am by the what by the grace of God you know you it's nothing that you can do if you say is that I'm saying I did this and I did that come on then you don't understand what Grace is all about come on you hadn't accepted what he has done for you and that's the problem that the Pharisees had in it because they looked at themselves as being holy they lived but what Jesus when he seen him he said you full of dead men bones and what all the corruption come on they they I was living according to the law come on but the law uh what the only thing the law could do was Judge it right and show you what sin was because without the law they didn't know what sin was so sin came I mean law came to show you what sin was right I was sharing with them last uh Sunday down in Sumter I say the thing is I said let me tell you about what the law does I say is that you can go down to the police station and say I ain't ran a stop sign in 10 years I ain't ran a red light in 10 years I kept the speed limit in the last 20 years and they'll probably say well thank you for keeping the law right but you get in your car and leave out that police station and run that first stop sign that police gonna pull you over ain't it come up to your car you say but I ain't ran a stop sign in 10 years right what are you going to tell you well that might be good and I hope y'all running for another 10 years but right now we're going to give you this ticket come on and your insurance you call the insurance company with insurance company gonna say we thank you for not but what we gonna your insurance going up ain't it come on because that's what the law is there to keep you in line right come on but it's something about Jesus Christ when he came on the scene he was going to show them aside of God that they didn't know nothing about a side of God that they hadn't experienced yet and what was that sign of God that side of God was Grace right come on that even though yes you broke the law but Grace is here come on the law has been broken but if you repent Grace is here come on my grace is sufficient for you I know my grace will cover you my grace will watch out for you Hallelujah I thank God for his grace because every day we wake up and we fall don't we but we got to Die daily like the scripture says but I thank God for the grace of God I can shout because of the grace of God I can and dance because of the grace of God that's on my life all the grace Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound that saved a Wretch like Me hallelujah oh Jesus something about that Grace come on when I talk about Grace after the fall you know but that's what it is they the law could only judge it right but Jesus is going to show them aside aside come on of him that the world didn't know you you know it's something about the Catholic church and how they held the world in fear for over a thousand years showing the world of what an Angry God right in which God a god with eyes of a flame and fire right and all these things but he will be that God one day now come on but as long as there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat come on then you can come before that Throne Hallelujah that judgment seat the only difference between the Judgment seat and The Mercy Seat is the blood Hallelujah as long as the blood is there you can come before it and you gotta Advocate with the father you can come to God and say Lord I'm sorry God forgive me for all of my sins Lord I need your help I'm in bad shape God I need your help today Hallelujah God loves a man like that don't he but one day blood will be taken off of that seat come on but it's the grace come on showing them aside of God aside of God that they hadn't seen before Grace Hallelujah Grace don't you know many people they want to break out they want to give God they want to live live for God but they can't they got chains holding them they want to worship God but they can't they got chains holding them the devil holding things over their life Hallelujah they want to live for God but they can't they got stuff holding them but don't you know that God has already took the keys of death hell in the grave come on God has already set you free a lot of times people sitting in a jail cell but the door is already open God has already set you free he already pardoned you he already took your place all you got to do is get up and walk out of there Hallelujah and serve the Living God hallelujah oh the joy that came to me when I knew that I was free when my savior found me and wrapped his loving arms around me all the joy that came to me hallelujah oh hallelujah it's saying that song God don't deliver me why should I be bound come on but that's what it is the devil got people bound on him you know I look at some things I said that in this life we're talking about Grace after the fall now we know that after the fall what happened man disobeyed God and we don't want to go all into that it'd be take too long but how they disobeyed God In The Garden of heed in it how you know he drove him out of the garden right put chair on the floor that says unless they come and eat from the Tree of Life and live forever right so he ran them out of there but even in all of that God had a way God I mean God had a Plan of Redemption didn't he he had a plan to get him back from that Fallen state so we see that in throughout all the Old Testament those Lambs that were slain come on and the blood of the Lambs and the bulls and goats you know it couldn't take away their sins It could only cover it from year to year but God had a plan didn't he they were only Shadows of types of the what the real lamb that was to come one day and who was that real lamb that real lamb was Jesus Christ you know in the in the old days when they brought that lamb and they took that lamb brought it to the priest and you know he he would take that lamb and hold it and they would take their hands and put their hands on that lamb head and they would take a knife and cut that Lamb's through right and they would take the blood from over that lamb and sprinkle them back on that person but they would let that person know that this lamb ain't did nothing wrong Hallelujah this lamb is dying because of what you did wrong God is accepting this lamb because of your sins it's because of your sins that this lamb has got to die but God is going to set this lamb Hallelujah but that was only a shadow of type of the real lamb that was to come I see John say Behold the Lamb of God who take gone to take away the what the sins of the whole world it was a lamb that was coming that when you lay your hands on him Hallelujah it was no longer that he would just cover your sins but he would take away your sins Hallelujah something would happen down on the inside Hallelujah the life that was in those blood and blood of bulls and goats couldn't come back home couldn't do nothing for you you walked away with this being the same person having the same conscience but when the Lamb of God came Hallelujah and he was said the life that was in his blood can come back on you and I in the form of the Holy Ghost Quicken our bodies we don't have to walk out living the same way but we can be changed from glory to glory we can be new preachers in Christ I don't know about you but I said Lord give me the change Hallelujah sometimes you got to get tired of just being a church member just coming in and out Sunday after Sunday and no change has taken place get out in and out Sunday after Sunday and still can't defeat the hammerites Hallelujah can't defeat the Hittites Hallelujah can't defeat your enemy walking in and out because you fighting the battle on your own but don't you know he said the battle ain't yours but the battle is the Lord's how you Overcoming By the blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony I ain't wrestling with this devil no more I'm giving it to God he's already defeated that's Hell In The Grave God took my place Hallelujah I'm not fighting I'm resting Hallelujah in the promise of God I'm not fearing I'm rusting I'm trusting I'm believing in what God Said Hallelujah you know we've been through so many battles here lately spiritually and naturally come on but the thing about it is I have more joy in those battles than I ever had before because the more that the enemy come in like that like a flood the more I'm learning how to release and give it to God Hallelujah the more I'm learning that I can't do nothing about it anyway but he said to come unto me all you that are heavily laying with burden and I'm gonna give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me Hallelujah for my yoke is easy Hallelujah and my burden is lights I don't know about you but I've been giving it to God I've been giving it to God and praising him along the way I ain't worried about it because God is still working on me God is still testing on me tribulation is working out patience patience is working out experience experiencing work in Our Hope Hallelujah I'm trusting in God I don't know about you but I'm trusting in God hallelujah come on for his grace you know it's something that hit my spirit the other day I was reading the scriptures and just looking at that and I believe it was Romans 9 and how you know Paul was talking about can the clay say to the powder why they have Thou made me thus come on he is talking about Israel and how they went through all of that with the in bondage and all these things and and how God raised up pharaoh he says but God did that that he might be able to show his power right his power and Earth he said what if God hallelujah what if God desired to show us power what if God want to want to show himself to the world and he desired to use you to to show the world that he's the same yesterday today and forever I started looking at trials and situations I said what if God hallelujah what if God want to show somebody that he's still a Healer and he decided to use me for that for that uh uh opportunity what if God hallelujah won't decide to show somebody he's still a deliverer and he decided to use me to show the world what if God hallelujah decided to show somebody he's still a way maker I'm looking at doors shutting your face but what if God hallelujah I want to be a vessel Hallelujah God I'm not going to complain God why have you made me thus but I am what I am by the grace of God I'll get where I'll get by the grace of God I'll be what I'll be by the grace of God thank you Lord for making me what you made me Hallelujah oh geez come on oh Jesus you know God does things you know God don't do things just for nothing y'all bleed up God got a purpose in everything don't he and some things look bad you know this life got all kind of twists and turns don't it you don't even know what's going to happen tomorrow things you expected they didn't turn out the way you thought they expected that you talked thought they'd turn up a lot of times don't it but what it is be patient come on give God give God a chance come on sit back sit back and like I said tribulation working patient wait on God and see what the outcome gonna be it's got to be good come on because we know that the Bible said all things work together for the what for the good of them that what love God it's got to go work out for your good you don't you don't know my situation though brother Ernest you don't know how bad it is I said do you love God because if you love God it's some good you're gonna come out of it if you lost God he gonna bless you somehow if you love God he gonna work that thing out if you lost God hallelujah and I don't know about you but I love God this morning I love God with all of my heart hallelujah oh thank you Jesus Grace after the fall I says whether some things look bad don't they come on some situations look bad I thought about it I was saying what if God I thought about that you know you look at those forest fires and all burn up the whole Forest on it burn it all the way up but don't you know out of the ashes come fertilization those ashes they says it's fertilized in the ground because a new crop didn't really come up new trees getting ready to come out come on God is getting ready to do something new in your life but when the fire is burning sometimes it's hard we don't see it when the fire is burning sometimes do we we don't see what God is doing because all we're seeing right now is the fire but that's why he says you got to look up to the heels from with come as your help the scriptures got to become real to you you got to come to a place in your life to where you know who you serve that you know that your God is the God of all gods that he's the king of all Kings and he's the Lord of all Lords that he can do anything you got to come to the place in your life to where you know that my God shall supply all of my needs according to his riches and Glory you got to come to your place in your life the way you know that he is the Healer he's the deliverer he's a savior you got to come to the Reckoning in your life that it ain't no storm that'll come that'll shake my faith ain't no wind that'll blow that'll blow me off course Hallelujah why because My Soul Is Anchored I know whom I believe you know the Bible says in that day they that know their God or do exploits of faith I ain't talking about somebody that doubting their God somebody that's running and hiding when those storms begin to raging when the battle get hot they don't want to go out there and fight come on but I'm talking about a warrior Hallelujah a fighter somebody that knows who's their Captain know will God their serve know that he can't lose a battle know that he's victorious in every situation he brought me through this Hallelujah and he'll bring me through that God is faithful in all things though he slay me yet I'll trust him I'm Gonna Keep Holding On To God's unchanging hand Hallelujah you got to oh Jesus come on oh Jesus come on Hallelujah I tell you what God has been so good to us but you know what even in the in that you'll say God has been so good to us what I've been looking at by the grace of God is the goodness of God is meted out through his grace come on God every day I said Lord thank you for your grace come on could have been dead and gone long time ago I'll cheer him up my wife my mother-in-law last night I said you know that car wreck over there and when I got in a bad wreck in 2003 that was the eye opener for me because what it was I said I see grace in that should have been dead and gone it's many occasions could have been dead and gone come on bullets flying all kinds of things should have been should have been dead and gone but what happened God's grace was covering me come on because God knew that one day I'd hear his voice one day he was calling you the whole time but you was trying to blot out that voice but God knew that one day you'd hear that voice and you say yes Lord here I am God I want to serve you God I wanna I Wanna Live for you God you reach out to him and one day he'd reached back down to you because he was waiting on you the whole time Hallelujah y'all believe that this morning come on God is so good I say grace come on God what Grace after the fall I even after the fall God had a plan to get man back what it was the Plan of Salvation was true to cross come on through the cross of Calvary he was going to bridge that Gap and he ain't gonna Force you that's one thing about God he ain't violent he ain't gonna Force you come on but the Bible says that whosoever will let them what come the drink of the Waters of Life freely come on it's a free gift God wants to give you something for free but you know many times people don't want him that's why in The Book of Romans it talks about when they knew God they didn't want him did they they want a creature more than the Creator talked about all those things and they did all those things they became vain in their own imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened come on God made a way to get out of the shape they were in God made a way for you and I we don't have to go to hell we don't have to go down that road but God made a way for us to get back to the tree of life but many don't want that way come on why because it's a straight and narrow way the Bible says straight is the gate and now is the way that leads to eternal life come on Broad is the way that leads to destruction many will go their way but not straighten that narrow way many times people don't want it they don't want to walk that that that walk of Holiness that that place to where the world is going to reject you that place is where the world ain't gonna receive you they're gonna laugh at you and pick at you because of the stand that you're taking Hallelujah but when I think about how much they laughed at my savior and how much they picked at him how much they talk about him but yet he was willing to go the distance for you and I because he know that if he didn't go that route he know that if he didn't give his life he know that if his blood wasn't shed Hallelujah then I wouldn't be saved today that you wouldn't be saved today so he was willing to go the distance I'll take the reproach out that of death I'll take the wrong for the right come on that they might be saved Hallelujah and I love them for today I thank God come on it's worth your dying it's worth your crying it's worth your living it's worth your giving why because of what he's done for you this morning Hallelujah come on God you know I always say oh it's still a lot of times that if you don't do nothing else he already done enough and you know I'm meeting that with all of my heart it's something how you know the grace of God you know the grace of God is different from from what uh from what the world picture you know that the grace of God is way different from what from what the world picture I mean I mean yeah picture it's different you know the Bible talks about hearing the fourth verse how he says here in the in the not the fourth verse he says in uh in the seventh verse no in the sixth verse for when we were yet without what strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely a righteous man will one die yet paraventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commended his love toward us that in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us come on his grace you can't understand the grace of God you know I asked somebody not long ago a couple of weeks ago I said why don't you want God they were calling me because they're going through all kind of trouble tribulations everything hit and falling apart and I've been trying to tell him I said you know God is the answer Jesus is your answer money can't help you right now you already saw that situations fall apart I said but God doesn't answer I said why don't you want God all he ever did was heal the sick raise the Dead all he ever did was come see about you in the Midnight Hour all he ever did was give you good lungs to breathe all he ever did was give you hands and legs to walk all God ever did was wake you up in the morning all God did was tell his angels to keep him around your car so when you riding down the highway nothing won't happen to you that's all God did come on all God did was when the things was getting ready to fall apart the devil had plans for your life God said I won't let it be so that's all God did why don't you want God this morning why don't you want to save you like that why don't you want to serve a God Like That that's been so good to you God has been so good to us he didn't have to do it but he did and he's still being good to us he's going overboard with his goodness Hallelujah oh Jesus why don't you want him come on what I said is that what it is when we were without strength right come on uh Christ died for us you know let's look at Ephesians 2 by the grace of God so I don't want to be long this morning Grace after the fall come on God's grace God's grace is something that you can't imagine this morning you can't even reckon with it all you can do is just be thankful for it because many people counted you out long time ago you know that people still count you out now but the grace of God like Paul said in that Grace and where I'm standing come on I'm standing in that Grace I'm living in that Grace I'm walking in it every day the grace not only the Grace but the favor of God sometimes people say I was telling some some boys at work the other day I said I ain't no Golden Child come on not not like that you're not just nobody special but what it is is the favor of God give you favor everywhere you go God giving you favor you don't even ask for it but God give it to you he said I loved you come on I like how the scriptures say yeah have I Loved You saith the Lord come on he began to talk about look at your brother and all them and where they are in the scriptures talking about Israel and all and he says but look at what I've done for you I've blessed you I took you up I took you took land from people oh oh God they built The Vineyards you didn't have to build them I took it from him and gave it to you God blessed you he said I bless you but yet you murmuring about these little things you you merman about the little things in life but don't you see what I've done for you come on and don't we find ourselves uh like that sometimes being discontent come on we ain't content with what God has blessed us with it's always it man he want to get more more and more his eyes ain't never satisfied come on but it's something about Christ he is your satisfying portion the Revelation is that when you get God you got everything he's all that you ever need he's all that you ever long for all you ever want when you get guard that's that that's the end of it all your search and you're thirsting you're hungry and he's the only one that could quench that sometimes we try to quench it with all other things but it'll never quench that thirst it'll never quench that desire it'll never give you that happiness it's only one thing that can quench that and that's God and it gets better all the time it don't get old with time come on it don't get old but it gets sweeter and sweeter as the day go by it gets better Hallelujah why because you know where you're going you know where you're headed at Hallelujah oh Jesus y'all believe that this morning come on I'm stirred this morning y'all stirred this morning come on Grace I can't even really get into it like I want to but Grace come on Ephesians 2 if you got to say man and you have to Quicken who were dead and trespassing sin wherein times past you walked according to the course of what according to the prince and the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and other mind and where by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but what come on somebody say but God this morning you know he got done talking about how we were by Nature right but who not nothing you could do could it was it nothing you had to do was with it was it huh but by who who was what ain't you glad for God's mercy this morning come on are you really glad for God's mercy this morning sometimes we forget you know what when we're in that Midnight Hour and the things are going bad we crying out for God and God come to the rescue oh the joy and the testimony we have right but let a little bit of time go on WE quick to forget what God has done for us we quick to forget where God how God delivered us when we called upon him how God uh uh uh uh quickly came you know was at work a couple years ago and talking about how how um you know everybody had a testimony or they was in a place once in their life and and something bad tragic was happening and how they said Lord if you ever get me out of this I won't never come back everybody on the in the table had that testimony and was telling their story and we was we were stirred up listening to those stories so then after everybody got done I said no did you keep did you keep that confession you know nobody kept the confession but you know what I said the thing is God knows when you made that confession that you wouldn't keep it but you know we serve a God that's rich in Mercy even though God knew you weren't gonna keep it you might have thought you was going to keep it but you forgot about him a little long way and God knew you'd forget but even in that God still honored it God still blessed you God still kept you now come on didn't he he didn't hold it against he still looked out for you come on that's the God we serve Hallelujah but when you think about what the goodness of Jesus and all he's done for you that'll make you want to repent right there and say Lord I'm sorry God get me back take me back to that place take me back to that confession that I made back to that place the way God I promise I'll give you my life I give you my all that's what I want to do God because I'm glad of what you did for me I'm glad you saved me I'm glad you delivered me I'm glad you kept me hallelujah oh Jesus come on God got to take us back to that don't says but God who was rich in Mercy for his great law wherewith he what loved us even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ by what by grace come on we're talking about Grace After the Fall by Grace right so I said are you saved yeah I pay my tithes every week what I got to do with it come on yeah I do this I go to church every Sunday the question is are you safe come on there's a lot of people go to church every Sunday who they ain't saved there's a lot of people give big donations to the church but they're not saved come on y'all believe that this morning come on are you saved come on he says by what by grace are you saved he says and he had raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in ages to come he might show they see the riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works unless any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto God unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk that we should walk in them come on I said by Grace this morning Grace after the fall Paul kept Paul kept uh uh uh pointing that out that when you were dead and trespassed you were a sin when you were no good when you were wretched come on I want you to remember that when you were that's why Paul one point he was telling them if anybody can brag I can brag he's talking about how he was taught at the feeding Amelia come on circumcise The Eighth Day of Hebrew or the Hebrew Pharisee the first see all these things he says but I had to count all that loss what does that mean I had to count all that none of that didn't mean nothing he said I had to forget about all that that I might learn the Excellency of Christ right because when I came to him I realized it wasn't what I could do for him but it was what it was accepting what he could he already had done for me come on and that's what it is it's not what you can do for God you got to accept what God has already done for you come on Lord I want to be in your service God I want to do your will well the first part of it is accepting what he's already done come on not by might nor by power but by his Spirit come on his blood that was shed on Calvary y'all believe that this morning come on it's by Grace all you say through faith not a Works unless any man should boast don't you know when Jesus came on the scene I closed this morning but when Jesus came on the scene and John baptized him you know him coming up out of the water what did John see John called him the Lamb of God didn't he come on who come to take away the sins of the whole world John saw Grace on two feet walking Hallelujah this right here what the law couldn't do Grace is here now come on everybody's healing yes that's when they all sinning coming to get baptized and all these things he says but here go Grace Hallelujah I can see John maybe looking at Jesus seeing his Spirit saying oh the grace that's come to us now Hallelujah where the law couldn't do Grace is here now come on when we're separated and and taken apart from God grace is here now come on Hallelujah and I don't know about you but I'm glad about that Grace I'm glad that Grace came you know when they brought that woman that was caught in the act of Jesus they said didn't the law say this but they didn't know about Grace Hallelujah when they brought him to him that woman throwed it down and say what shall we do the law say kill her right but Grace what did Grace do Grace says that any among you without sin Let Them cast the first stone Hallelujah nobody could judge that woman but he said go and don't do it no more Hallelujah Grace is here now when the accuser want to accuse you every day Hallelujah bring you before the altar but Grace is here now Hallelujah let Grace speak for you don't you thank God for Grace this morning come on Grace Grace you know I always always says that I love to see you know those that are down to down and out the drug addicts the prostitutes those that were all the alcoholics I love to see them come to Christ you know I said because that's a pure picture of Grace come on that a lot of times the devil they in there inside in the heart they want to be delivered but the devil got embound they got them Health you know because of the church the Pharisees knows you're gonna look at them funny they can't come in the house of God come on that's how it is sometime in it but it's something about Grace Grace to go out and get them on it Grace will go where that person is Grace to go to the crack house Grace would go to the to the to the wide holes and the liquor store Grace to go to the prostitute house come on and Grace will go get them on it he'll let them know that I know that your sins are scarlet but I'll make them wide as snow that's what Grace would do Hallelujah Grace and let them know that ain't no respect to persons with God come on I died for you just as I died for to him come on but there is no respect the person who will all whoever will let them come Grace is here hallelujah I love that about Grace come on but what it is you got to accept that Grace come on you got to receive what Christ has already done for you how many one received that this morning let us buy our heads in the word of prayer amen Jesus Grace oh the grace how many thankful for that gracious morning how many can lift their hands and say Lord I'm thankful for the grace Grace there were shoutings of Grace when the Capstone was coming Grace Hallelujah not about might no about power I can't work hard enough I still

what it is the grace of God is covering us you know I was praying one day and I could see the devil shooting all kinds of things darts at us in our way but I says the grace of God is like a blanket they're catching them every time catching it I said God's grace a lot of times the Lord is showing me the devil got plans for you and you don't even know it but the grace of God Is Watching Over You the grace of God is keep you but in that by and by in that day you'll see just then how much God was keeping you sometimes you go in this life thinking you're doing things on your own you got it you're on you're grown like sometimes I'm grown I can do I go but you'll realize one day that it was never your working it was never your strength but it was God the whole time watching over you keeping you he kept the Breath of Life in you because he could take it away at any time he could take things away from you anytime he won't can he and without an explanation but the grace of God Is
