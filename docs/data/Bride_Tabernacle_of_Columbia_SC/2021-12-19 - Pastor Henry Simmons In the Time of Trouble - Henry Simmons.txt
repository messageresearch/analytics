those that are listening in we thank god for you i'll read the first you read the next and we'll read the sixth verse together one through six psalms 27 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life too whom shall i be afraid going home shall encamp against me my heart shall not fear the wall shall rise against me and this will i be confident for for in the time trouble he shall hide me in his prevailion in the secrets of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock together now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies around right now therefore will i offering his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i was saying yea i was saying praise unto the lord amen god bless you may be seated we thank god amen hallelujah what a wonderful time it is you know these this just seemed like when when i was praying and meditating on the lord and then um i just got up this morning with something on my heart in the time of trouble i know that you and i are looking at our surrounding in the world today i said the whole world is in trouble we can look at the pandemic and we can look at the different things that are happening the occurrences the modern events made clear by prophecy we understand that it's too many things happening to uh that we'll we can look around we say we're living in troubled times so it's this morning as i think about and on the other day yesterday i was thinking about trouble times we were in trouble times and then my heart was confident when i thought about even though we're in trouble times so i i just shortened it says that verse it says in the time of trouble amen in the time of trouble and uh the webster said trouble in the definition he says it's wary people are worried if it's not about the job it's not about uh the family children or wife husband or there's just so many things to be troubled about the economy it's just so much trouble happening in the school everywhere you look it's trouble so much and so i began to look back at jove and he said the man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble so that's just but it looks like it's extra added trouble look like we have a double potion of trouble amen as we look every it just looks like it's just his trouble has increased it says trouble having to do with worry you get people are worried about everything nothing is stable so people are just worried care anointings then it talks about trouble being suffering difficulties unhappy situations people don't seem to be happy anymore unhappy situations disturbance so as i was looking at that i said in the time of trouble let me just let you kind of view that jesus understood that the time that we're living in was coming so in matthew 24 and 3 matthew 24 and 3 jesus addressed our time in the day that we're living in and he says in matthew 24 and 3 says and as he sat upon the mountain of olives his disciples came unto him privily saying tell us when should these things be what shall be the sign of what god coming into what end of the world you know that was over 2000 years ago that they were concerned about the end of the world now what would make them think that the end of the world would come in their time and what would be the sign of thy coming and tell us when the end of the world gonna come jesus in the fourth verse jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man what see because he knew that this was going to be such a deceptive time the end of the world we would face such a deceptive time are you with me so people are are being deceived by the millions and by the billions but this was going to be one of the most deceptive times in ever in the history of the world this was going to be the most deceptive time we talk about the mark of the beast and all of that and the bible says he he deceived the whole world so and if he deceived the whole world what makes you not a victim of deception why amen do you think that you shall escape the deception that would hit the whole world he said to us be not what be not deceived because it's a possibility if you amen are not aware or conscious you will be deceived but he says be not deceived then he gives us things that will confront us in this hour as we approach the end of the world he says for many shall come in my name saying i'm christ and shall what to see many it's a lot of folks come in the name of the lord but they are deceiving many because it's not according to the word of god it's not what the bible says that's why paul said though we an angel come from heaven preach any other gospel than that which we preach he said let him be a curse are you with me but we'll believe because they come in the name of the lord they they they say they god sent them and they said god said and folk just accept it because it's been well received by the popular opinion then it must be all right amen because uh the majority of the world is believing it amen most christians amen they are receiving it so it must be all right then he says here you shall hear a walls and rumors of walls see that you be not what we're talking about in the time of trouble went through iraq and afghanistan the different walls and still walls going on everywhere walls in the streets in chicago walls in the street where young folks are just killing one another just they had a funeral yesterday down in mullins you know and just people are just shooting down one another we're in trouble time young people just not safe as brother ernest said the other day you're not safe in the school you're not safe anywhere it's traumatized you don't know who's going to turn on you who going you know just you can't walk the streets you're not safe anywhere we're in trouble times you you know you used to be feel a little safe you got to watch you always got to be on guard and most most folks are getting a cecilia what weapons permit what they call it concealed weapon permit but is that going to protect you folks don't care amen we put camels on our house and camels all around and put alarms and everything but you're still not what you're still not safe you still got to worry about somebody might still look like they don't care if the camera's there they you you order some online they go up on your porch know the camera's there got the picture and everything to steal take it anyhow they don't care not about being caught are you with me so we're living in trouble time with folk amen that folks will kill you and know they're going to go to jail but they're just careful not see not understanding their consequences to their actions things are going to follow if you do it young people are throwing away their lives they're doing anything that comes into their mind this is like in the days of noah every imagination that thought the men's hearts were continually evil and god said it repented me that i made man your muscle was troubled times back then that muscle was a time of trouble in the days of noah if muscle was a time of trouble in in the days of sodom and gomorrah it must it was trouble time that caused god to say it repented me that i made man but the bible said as it was in the days of noah and as it was in the days of sodom thus shall it be in the day when the son of man what should be the signs of that coming and not the end of the world are we near that time uh oh i think reality got a strike somewhere something got to shake us somewhere amen we're not being shaken praise god you don't know amen if you if you're not secured troubled times people thought if i take my shot and i do this do that and then we didn't know something else is on the horizon another virus another this another die trouble people amen what's next what's the next see that you be not troubled for these things must what come to pass but the end is what nations shall rise against nations and kingdoms against kingdoms and there shall be what famine amen pestilence earthquakes is that real in diverse places different places amen all these are the beginning of what sorrow so sorrow is something that that sorrow has hit the hearts of people they don't seem to be able to lift up their heads above the the sorrow and the pains of the world and the things that they are seeing reflected oh god on the news and all around us and it looked like it's no hope for this world that's why people are giving up sorrows then shall they deliver you up and be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all what for my what i want to know you know are you trying to fit in or you you know that you got to go through some persecution to enter into the kingdom amen are you trying to fit in with this world thinking that you're going to be accepted as a christian in this world you think it's all right to go along with the word of god and not be persecuted you're going to be persecuted you ought to realize that i got to fulfill that i'm going to be hated all that live godly in christ jesus shall what suffer persecution you going to go through some stuff brother sister amen being a christian people say oh they're christian they ought to be happy no when you're a christian you're going to suffer something he said if any man come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and what follow me brother and sister we go we're going through something and you're going to go through something people are not going to love you amen the bible said if man love you amen the love of god is not in you the world love his the world love his own if you're gonna fit in with the world i can see the world loving you well uh i get along with the world something wrong folk love me i i got a lot of friends in the world who said i was a friend of the words the enemy with god are you with me it's not clicking because we think that amen we can out amen we cannot manipulate and maneuver the word we're going to be all right amen nothing is going to harm me because i know i got it all together that's what the devil would have you to think that you have it all together and you know where you stand and who you are amen and the devil ain't gonna touch you but brother and sister somehow amen you can actually receive yourself in your own craftiness you can think that you know how you meant to handle yourself but brother sister amen i thank god that when i'm weak then he's strong amen i realize that i need god every moment every hour i realize that i'm not no match for the devil so i'm dependent on jesus i'm leaning on him to take care of me to watch over me because i can't i can't keep myself i need jesus i need help in the time of trouble i lift my eyes to the heels from whence come in my help hey god now my health come from the lord i'm depending on you god i'm dependent on jesus because i know you're in the time of trouble i got a hiding place said i got a hiding place amen any secret i got a secret place brother amen i got a sacred place sister they've been in the secrets amen god got a place that you can run and hide hallelujah i got a secret place praise god the devil can't get in that place hallelujah because i got a secret place the bible said in the secret hallelujah that's a secret that means amen praise god it has to be revealed to you the place that god wants you to go to hey i heard somebody say i can go to the rock amen i can go to the rock where i need a shot when i need a friend i can go to the rock hallelujah thank god amen hallelujah that god has prepared a place that in the time of trouble amen god has prepared a place amen that i don't have to be troubled because he said let not your heart be troubled yeah if you believe in god i don't believe also in me thank god that i got a place i got a secret place i got a hiding place somebody said in the word of god i've got to hide in place amen i know that the lord has given me a secret place that i can run and hide in thank god that i got a place hallelujah but he prepared a place amen to the presence of my enemy amen i got to please amen that i know that god in the secrets of his traveling hallelujah i got a hide in place in the word of god hey amen i heard my sister amen praise god in the word of god sister rosie is he singing i got a hiding place in the word of god hallelujah screaming to the top of the voice because she believed that in the word of god amen i have a hiding place hallelujah thank you jesus i can hear singing with all they mean she's just getting sad amen she put the top men in in the word of god i got a heart in place i believe when you believe it you got some feeling in it amen you feeling something amen she gotta she got into it i gotta hide in place because she knew it was personal and brother and sister we got to know amen we there's a secret place amen that we can run and hide praise god in the time of trouble i've got to hide in place in the secrets of a tabernacle shall he hide me not only will he hide me but he set me upon him amen isn't that right praise god he set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my my enemies run about me amen i'm so glad that i have a hiding place i'm getting ahead of myself amen praise god it just didn't i i just can't go as planned they met praise god but i i said sometimes you you try to outline a little something on paper but you know you got to look to god he might take your beginning and let it be the end he might take you in and let it be the beginning whatever god does i i said god you're in control but i know one thing that i want the message to get home they meant that amen praise god hallelujah in the time of trouble if if he can get home they meant that we amen agree that in the time of trouble they may praise god that we are in trouble times praise god beginning of sorrow amen they hate hate of all nations for they say amen so he says then shall they deliver you up then shall many be offend offended the 10th first and she'll betray what that's what the devil wants you to do betray what that's why the bible say what love and the devil said what betray one another don't you know sister son said that don't you know brother song something i know what he was thinking in you know yeah i know him just a brother sister i know that one oh they would betray one another don't you be a victim of betrayal that i'm gonna be the one portraying my brother my sister that i'm gonna try to tear down their character i'm gonna look at their weak points and i'm going to point them out that's what balaam did he could not curse god people but he pointed out he meant the weakness are you with me and you know amen if we if each and every one of us you can look at us and look at us through the the flesh in me that is in my flesh dwell it's what no good thing isn't that right so you can it is you know when when pilot looked at jesus he said i find no one but you know the bible says now when it comes down to us and we say we have not sinned we make him a liar isn't that right so what happens we we have faults all the time we have to ask god for forgiveness he said my little children are writing to you that you sin not but if any man sin he have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous he's the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but for the whole world he said if we confess our sins he's faithful just to what but he wants us to confess and for satan isn't that right he don't want us to continue and send the grace of me about he wants us to confess and forsake don't just tell god i'm sorry and go keep on doing it don't ask god to forgive you and you're going to keep on doing it if you confess your sins and forsake them are you with me stop doing it okay so here we are he says betray one another and share what shall hate one another you know it doesn't matter what a person say about you do to you whatever you cannot because that's not one of the attributes of god it's not hate and when you say i hate him i don't like her i can't stand her sometimes you got to change your vocabulary you ever heard those things come out of jesus mouth i said you can hate the sin but not the sinner so actually you're looking at the wrong person i mean you're looking at the individual you're not looking at the spirit the spirit that has them bound taken captive you need to look at the spirit and stop saying i hate her it's not her it's the spirit that's in her then you hate that spirit and you pray to god amen deliver them from that spirit are you with me so you know how to pray for them and love them uh well i i i have nothing to do with them i'm a oh no no no no if you got love love a cup of what a multitude of what sin what if jesus said well because you did listen i'm gonna avoid you i ain't gonna have nothing to do with you all you have to do is do that one day you can't go a day that you're walking so perfect that god says you're perfect but god can say you perfect but he's saying you perfect because of what your attitude towards the word are you with me he saw job he said a perfect and upright man what god can look at him perfect amen why because god knew that that man would give sacrifice not only for himself but for his children amen and god saw that man continually sacrifice and god knew amen when you if you stumble or you fall god knows that in your heart you're going to repent quickly god said david was a man after my own heart though he did some wicked stuff but david had a repentant heart not only did he have a repentant heart he wanted to do right and make things right and live right are you with me but you know some folk amen they just do things and thank god they're gonna make god forgive them because amen i'ma ask him to forgive me he got to do it god he's a forgiving god and he doesn't but you know god people don't realize that their action they're not really they're telling god what to do they're not asking god a lot of folk tell god that amen you said it and almost god you better do it are you with me but one day you're going to find out god is god and he's a just god amen he knows whether or not you know you for real or whether or not you're faking you know a lot of times folk be faking that they're christian and that they love god there's a lot of make-believers you know there's a lot of hypocrites amen when it comes down to salvation and being a christian there's a lot of hypocrites in the pulpit there's a lot of hypocrites all over the place but that don't have nothing to do with you you just be real whatsoever you do for jesus let it be real you have a responsibility for your own soul you be real amen let it be real whatever you do for jesus let it let it be real okay so by the grace y'all oh god god is good you love him so here we are amen hating one another you know one of the most wicked place you can go to sometimes is the church people in the club they're so drunk that they gonna hug the enemies people out there at the crack house they're so cr they just buy other folk crack come on people in drinking hey you man you want a shot they're loving everybody they're so high they they're loving everybody man you want something come on get some of this you know what i'm saying so people are actually you know doing things that under another influence or another spirit they doing they showing so much love one to another but that's not godly love to give a man a drink to give a man some crack to give a man a cigarette you know you know oh man never got so much i'll tell you sometimes look like they all do the christians in the right but at the same time but when you give a man truth you're giving the word of god you're giving a man eternal life are you what man you're giving us something that's real you're giving it something that everlasting whatever they give it it'll weigh off the little friendship of the world a little you know people i'm going to tell you something a true friend you make a man that's still going to be your friend amen you can talk about them next year gonna be your friend you can do it wrong they're still gonna be your friend that's a true friend isn't that right a true friend to stick with you why because they believe that you know friendship is a valuable it means something when friendship is a valuable thing that it does mean something to the individual and i want you to know that a lot of people don't value friendship they just they give up on you quick you know i was looking at a a precious brother that ministered all over the world he's running some difficult times in his life and i said i wish that i could you know sit down and talk with him and see how many friends he got now and i thought about job i said brother minister all over the world probably in 75 100 different countries but how many friends how many friends folk church pack hundreds of people but when you go through some difficult times how many people are going to be really there with you still sticking with you praying for you trusting god believing for you i thought about job you know sometimes in your troubled times they say why don't you just go and take your life commit suicide joe white said why don't you curse your god and what die you know what's going on no no you know you know how it is pressure gets so difficult and things could go so wrong in your life sometimes things can get so turned around and so mixed up so why don't you just go boom i mean it's easy or just take some just take off it's gone it it ain't it ain't worth nothing so it's all wife one closely you know sometimes folk real close to you amen they really he's all friends they talk about what should have done wrong job you know you did this and that amen you know every everything your children taken and your cattle everything your resources everything that job had was taken from him and and it come down to you you know the one that's close to you i mean you already lost your children you already lost your cattle you lost your camels you lost everything and now your wife it's going to tell you to curse god and die you know what i'm saying trouble can come brother amen they said you know you know what they said when it rained it posed amen and sometimes folk amen and facing your trouble and facing your time of adversity things that you have to face uh that you have to go through sometimes it can be a lot of pain and a lot of suffering i i believe many times job was crying out to the god amen it's somewhat like jesus said amen when he was praying in the garden everybody for sick he said father it would be possible let this cup pass but he said no nonetheless not my will but what your will be done we're gonna have to have tests and trials and tribulations brother and sister amen but god is expecting us to come out as pure gold amen because he knows it's going to be a furnace of fire amen it's going to be affliction and things that you have to pass through amen but god said though you go through the waters no you go through the floods so you go through the fire he said i'll be with you are you with me so by the grace of god uh you know the lord's putting on on my heart i says you know god why are you saying this to me is this somebody that had suicidal uh thoughts and thinking uh uh uh the possibility that you want to inject this in the message this morning and i said well maybe god you're speaking to somebody that has those uh things that things have gotten swole up and it's too heavy to bear it's too much that i'm going through i i cannot seem to face meant myself i cannot amen when i wake up i i'm just going through stuff i said lord is it so he you know he says yeah joe went through his cycle he went to his times of adversity and then i could see david waking up and i can see him saying weeping man do it for a night amen the night can get kind of dull but he said weeping man do it for a night but joy comes in the morning in the time of trouble praise god where can i go amen where can i go seeking a refuge for my soul where can i go but to the law amen praise god i'm talking about i'm so glad that i can go to the rock that i got a place that i can go to amen i got a shelter from the store where can i go but to the law praise god i know job didn't have nowhere else no other resource nobody nothing only thing he had that he could go through all the days of my appointed time he said i'm going to wait i'm waiting on the law praise god you got some difficult times that you're going through amen you've got some trouble waters that you're passing through he said the prophet said there'll be some troubled waters that you got to pass through amen you got some trouble water that you got to pass through amen but you got to hold your god's unchanging hand you got to believe that god if you're alive praise god then i must be contagious amen god amen you'll put no more on me that i can bear so lord don't you slay me yet i'm going to trust you i know it's going to be all right in the moment amen it's it'll be all right if you hold to god's unchanging hand everything will be all right amen all you got to do is just trust the one amen that he said somebody said he'll be a bridge over troubled waters they may praise god he'd be a rock in the wilderness in a weary land isn't that right brother sister don't you give up on god because he won't give up on you amen don't you even let nothing even trouble you hear me praise god i heard paul said to be trouble on every side amen pray amen i i i perplexed but i'm not in despair amen praise god i'm trouble but i'm not going to give up amen thank god hallelujah oh god
