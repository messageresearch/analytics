precious name of jesus christ amen and amen [Music] amen have your bibles tonight tell me to the book of saint luke the 17th chapter very familiar text but i want to take it maybe from a different angle not meaning to be long at all tonight really i feel a little warm amen but i thank god for anyhow amen luke 17 and 11 and then psalm 75 and 1. 1711 through 19 and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood a fall off and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourself unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said where dare not ten cleanse but where are the nine there are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith had made thee whole i want you to hold your hands there go meet your book of psalms boys feeling like you want to go out psalm 75 just one verse one seven to five and one unto thee oh god do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declared let us pray father god we thank you tonight for your mercy and for your grace we pray god that you bless the word in jesus name amen may be seated want to just for a few minutes tonight and not even really to preach tonight but just to try to [Music] speak a little on giving god thanks i know it seems to be very simple even talking about it but i was thinking one morning that i got up and it just kind of struck me you know that god is good and the words don't really even express my gratitude for what god has done and what he is doing and what he is going to do you may even look at yourself and think that you don't have nothing to give thanks for but you do if god would even open up our eyes and let us see the things that he has delivered us and protected us from i believe we'll be more appreciated but the things that he has given us in allowing us to be able to do i like that song that uh discusses those things and said that uh you know when i think about the goodness of god and what all he done it makes you want to shout when you and i just think about our own lives and where god brought us from somebody said brother ernie said he brought you from a mighty long way you may look at your mistakes and you may look at uh what you are not but thank god for what you are somebody said that be patient with me because god isn't through with me here i'm just thinking a little report there in marion we the lord blessed that you know we had three people sinners that gave their life to the lord and looking at me having water baptism with them you know and i say you know lord thank you because it showed that god is still in the saving business i know it's very real that we see sinners you know repent and come to the lord but you know it's still sure that there are some people that want god amen and i just said lord you know it's nothing uh no credit nobody can get because that's god's grace so we are working with them and don't have no religious background basically you know i said and that's the best kind because it's harder to deal with religious folks but we see that here in luke jesus had went by a place samaria and there were 10 lepers you know leopard was supposed to be an incurable disease and jesus saw these ten lepers standing afar off you know in those days that the jews and samaritan had no dealing with a samaritan a half jew and a gentile so they really didn't had much dealing with them maybe i can see them that their case was hopeless so they kind of distant themselves maybe because of a acquisition or some kind of reproach that maybe somebody would have said but jesus saw him there and when jesus saw him you know i i thank god that he doesn't look at us in that way he doesn't look at how bad your situation is he doesn't look at how hopeless it may be to you or maybe even to the doctors maybe that can't do anything for you god can help you and when he looked at him he lost he lifted up his voice they begin to say jesus master have mercy on us you know that if you had a situation that was helped listen you may have heard about jesus and you got in uh a place that where you could call him perhaps maybe that he can do something for your situation i don't know about you but i realized that i need jesus lord have mercy on us how are we going to make it if god don't make a way how are we going to be able to stand what's coming upon his earth if it wasn't for the mercy and the grace of god no we don't even deserve and we don't know how we don't know when but jesus have mercy that's what we want tonight have mercy on my faults on my short coming lord i i don't want you to judge me god but i want your mercy thank god he's merciful thank god he's long suffering thank god he see beyond our faults and he see our need nothing we can boast about is god mercy on us how you made it as far as god mercy how you are still here in this hour at this time in this day it was only god mercy i you could have been like everybody else the bible say men hearts are failing for fear because of what's coming upon the face of the earth the other day in haiti i heard about haiti had an another earthquake california's on fire again seemingly it stays on fire people lives at jeopardy our lives are at jeopardy and the only way we're going to make it is god's grace be the bible say if the righteous scarcely lord have mercy be saved how is it god mercy on us they saw him you know it's something that when you get in the presence of god you realize you need his mercy we are facing things in our lives and all around us in our homes that job at work you know everywhere we go things that we don't even know what we're dealing with but we're trusting in the mercy of god jesus heard these leper 10 reminders 10. heard that cry you know god always healed contrite in a broken spirit when people began to cry out god began to move here as jesus heard they cry he began to tell them when he saw them he said to them go and show yourself to the priests in the old testament the priests are the one that's supposed to announce that a leper has been cleansed there was a proper way that it had to be done but jesus being a high priest and he could have been touched by the feeling of the infirmity and i want to say tonight he can be touched by your infirmity whatever it is that you may be going through god can be touched by it and as it went they were cleansed but one of them when he saw that he was healed he turned back maybe our paraphrase he said maybe he didn't really recognize what had happened to him but something struck him i got to go back and give god thanks sometime in our minds we we have to understand uh that we maybe didn't give god the proper things as the songs say because he deserves that he's better than just good i don't believe good is even a word that you can express how much and how well god can take care of us even when you don't even think you deserve it god still does it oh yes sir i know sometimes we even give up on our own self oh but god but god who is rich in mercy or god who is rich in grace extended his love toward us oh he's able to raise lord have mercy how can you hold your peace all right there's a woman in the bible one time god did something for her and she just just went off start screaming and hollering they try to quiet her down come on you they couldn't quiet her down you know when god has done something for you you can't hold it you got to tell everybody oh when the opportunity come and you were able to give god some things you begin to tell them what god is still able to do oh not a yesterday god none of the last week god not the last year god i'm talking about a living present god right now feel like shouting lord have mercy when we understand and really want to get clear by the garden uh we understand how to worship god can we be so stirred and on fire we'll be so full and david said and we come to them doors i was glad when they said unto me oh my a people that understand god wants you a man to give him thanks come on we'll thank our parents for what they do we'll thank this one but how about giving god some thanks come on you don't need music all you need to do open your mouth and say thank you jesus many of us could have been dead this week god might have spared you maybe through a tragedy a wreck and god just gave you a little bit of grace you might have been facing some something else in your life and what the devil tried to trap you but god just stepped right in time ah i thought about i was just coming the other day down two knots you know and all of a sudden i looked in my mirror and i saw you know a car he was getting it there on two notch and i saw i began i said let me get over in this right lane and before i knew it that car then got right up on me and just so happened it was a bridge there just a little bit of space you know he came and i kind of saw him and i kind of was able to get back over and i said thank you jesus i said because you never know you know it's good uh to have god amen in your life when you can't even protect yourself god is your protector well we are wearing the masses and we are doing the shots and we're trying to take precaution that's good but god is your protector i'm ready to stop no servant of god oh my my mind servant of god say medicine does not heal you it only aids nature he said god is the healer and no matter what the devil is trying to do church oh god is your healer i'll be the bible say god heal all oh i like that he didn't just name you know sugar or high blood or uh cancer but he said oh everything you may even contact with everything that may even try to come upon you god got you back i read the bible said and when the enemy comes in like a flood he said the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard i'm closing let's go to one more scripture the book of first thessalonians oh my i wish that i know how to really enter into the praises of god sometimes you get a little beside yourself but i think sometimes we need to one lady sing this song she said if you understood my pain you understand my praise she was saying how she was homeless that she was left for dead but she said but god god lifted her she she was on welfare she was at her lowest point and everybody around her gave up except jesus i want to tell you people when it seemed like every thing and everybody else has given up on you god still cares telling the young man very marion he kind of a street guy and i was just sharing my testimony to how god delivered me from the drug scenes and stuff and i noticed his eyes just but i would let them see what god did for me he can do it for you too he's still god and he has not changed he still is a deliverer he is still a provider he is still a comforter he is still a drug out of peace he's still a provider it doesn't matter how long you may have been in your shape god is still a provider oh my he'll provide a way for you that you can't even imagine what you've been trying to work to do god will just give it to you because of your faithfulness to god and i can't help excuse me i had to keep saying this you know because it come back to me brother simmons you know like he told me that long years ago you know he told me don't put nothing before god and i know it may some of you can't know why you keep saying because god done something because i believe the word i believe that god had something in it it stuck with me and i tried to live by that yes i may have could have been over here and over there doing this and doing that but i stood still and i made up in my mind regardless of what i don't have what i have i'm still going to serve the lord i'm not going to count god slack because i say god is not slack concerning his promises don't cut god slack don't count god that he can't do he can do anything oh my he never failed me brother never failed me seven children all young and god made away seven now even my little baby now is 13. lord have mercy where did the time go but i saw what god could do i saw how he could provide for me when i couldn't even provide for myself everything's of god to prove himself to you god don't need your all your ability what god needs is your faith that way you say prove me saith the lord try me see rather i do what i say i do you say can i'm a god and i can't lie i'll back up what i said and i found to be nothing but the truth scripture here i'm closing brother simmons first there's throne in five i'm
