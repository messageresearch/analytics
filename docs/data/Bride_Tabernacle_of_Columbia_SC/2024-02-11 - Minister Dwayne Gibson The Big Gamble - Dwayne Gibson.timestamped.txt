[41:56] the 8th
[42:00] chapter Mark
[42:03] 8 and
[42:06] 35-37 and we go to Matthew
[42:09] 16 you got to say amen amen praise the
[42:12] Lord let us read for whosoever will save
[42:16] his life shall lose
[42:19] it but whoever shall lose his life for
[42:23] my sake and the gospels to say
[42:27] shall save it for what shall it profit a
[42:31] man or a woman Bo a girl he shall gain
[42:35] the whole world and lose his soul what
[42:37] it going to profit you let's go to the
[42:40] Book of
[42:44] Matthew Matthew
[42:50] 16 these two passages of scriptures are
[42:55] saying the same
[42:57] thing and I read I'm reading both
[43:01] passages in order to let it be firmly
[43:04] settled on your mind the Bible said they
[43:07] there be established in the mouth of two
[43:08] or more witnesses that's right so we
[43:11] want to get this firmly established in
[43:14] your mind Matthew 16 and
[43:22] 24 then said Jesus un his disciples If
[43:25] any man come after me let him deny
[43:28] himself and take up his cross and follow
[43:31] me whoever sh will save his life shall
[43:35] lose it whoever lose his life for my
[43:38] sake shall find it for what is a man
