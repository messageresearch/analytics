[31:23] if i could tell that testimony just what
[31:25] you see right now is where god bought me
[31:26] from i know that was about about 14
[31:28] years ago um i was a fugitive i was a
[31:32] part of the gang i was with the rolling
[31:34] 60 crips
[31:35] um
[31:37] i was on a room fugitive for about three
[31:39] and a half years had a whole nother
[31:40] identity
[31:42] um
[31:42] and
[31:43] i was just
[31:44] lost when you're looking at the world
[31:47] and where i was at
[31:49] i had achieved that goal of being who
[31:52] the man was and we talked about the wars
[31:55] i was a drug trafficker and i was
[31:57] supplying my whole area where i was at
[32:00] and i was the one everybody was looking
[32:01] to i had all the money i had the power
[32:04] but i was miserable
[32:06] and i was addicted to drugs
[32:08] and
[32:09] it just seemed like
[32:12] death was around the corner i had a gun
[32:14] everywhere i went um
[32:16] this pair and i remember just sitting in
[32:18] the barber chair getting a haircut and
[32:19] having a gun on me
[32:21] when i said i had a gun i always had one
[32:22] in the chamber but you had to be ready
[32:24] out there the mentality i had was very
[32:27] different let's kill her be killed
[32:29] the wolves will smell you if you're weak
[32:31] you don't want to live like that
[32:33] it was i was
[32:35] heavily dated all the time
[32:37] because i was just paranoid
[32:39] and couldn't trust anybody but i
[32:42] remember praying one day i talked to my
[32:44] aunt and she told me if you call on the
[32:46] name of jesus he'll save you
[32:48] i remember going out before i made my
[32:50] runs one day i think i had some drugs i
[32:53] put them in the console remember putting
[32:55] my gun right there right beside me and i
[32:57] remember praying on
[32:59] in the driveway that day before i left
[33:01] out i said lord it's a beautiful sunny
[33:03] day
[33:04] say lord if you save me i'll go all the
[33:06] way
[33:07] and i went on doing what i was doing not
[33:09] thought nothing of when i prayed that
[33:11] prayer but
[33:12] i i said it was a little while after
[33:14] that i don't even i would say probably a
[33:16] month even i don't know but i remember i
[33:19] was on the bench for a couple of days i
[33:20] had this place i used to go to was on
[33:22] the golf course that was my little duck
[33:24] off spot when nobody would mess with me
[33:27] these guys they were on drugs and i
[33:28] would be in their basement
[33:30] these people had money and i that's why
[33:32] i would go there i'd be in their
[33:34] basement ducked off
[33:35] you know
[33:37] i remember i was on the bench for a
[33:38] couple days and i was on the couch
[33:40] nobody came downstairs because that's my
[33:42] area i ain't want nobody down there
[33:44] because i'll be on the drugs back
[33:46] and i remember uh i was laying on the
[33:49] chair it was pitch black and i remember
[33:52] that door opened i saw a light coming
[33:54] down the stair and i remember putting my
[33:56] pillow my face in the pillar
[33:58] and when i did that i felt somebody
[34:00] standing over me it's like that light
[34:03] was blowing it scared me
[34:04] and said my name
[34:06] said damian are you satisfied
[34:09] and i looked and my life was flashing
[34:11] before my eyes of everything i was doing
[34:14] trying to make
[34:15] everybody else happy in myself and i was
[34:17] miserable
[34:18] that said my name that voice my bones
[34:20] tremble nobody knew my name i had
[34:23] another identity aliases and all of that
[34:25] but nobody knew my real name

[34:29] right there i'm talking about boo hoo
[34:31] crying it's not no like it just felt
[34:35] like i just let everything go right then
[34:37] and

[34:40] myself together and i remember going to
[34:42] i went to a guy i was going back to my
[34:44] house and i went to a gas station and i
[34:46] remember saying lord i'm ready and i
[34:48] heard that voice said um i said i'm
[34:50] ready if you're gonna be with me that
[34:52] same voice said i've been with you the
[34:53] whole time

[35:16] hundred dollars and i called my aunt to
[35:18] come get me
[35:19] and i said they was looking at me
[35:21] strange because after all i had i
[35:24] remember going home with a trash bag
[35:27] full of clothes i ain't wanting to take
[35:28] none of that stuff with me
[35:30] um i remember going to turn myself in

[35:50] i had a little bit of time by the grace
[35:51] of god they only gave me six months
[35:53] um and i remember going in uh it was up
[35:56] here in columbia and i wanted to get
[35:59] saved but i ain't know how
[36:01] i ain't no like
[36:02] all i knew was jesus was a son of god i
[36:04] couldn't get past the first page of the
[36:06] bible all i knew was god created heavens
[36:08] and earth that's about all i knew about
[36:09] the bible i ain't never really listened
[36:11] whenever grandma took me to church i was
[36:13] trying to go there so i won't get fussed
[36:15] at
[36:16] um but i just remember going to a
[36:19] service and the man was saying if you
[36:21] ask the lord to forgive you all your
[36:22] sins you call on them jesus he'll be
[36:24] saved and i remember going to my cell
[36:26] that night praying
[36:27] and i said and i just asked the lord
[36:29] forgive me of everything i've ever done
[36:30] and i forgave everybody now i never
[36:32] lived with my mom or dad and i think
[36:35] what there was a root of bitterness in
[36:37] me and i had to forgive them
[36:39] of how i felt and all what they did i
[36:41] forgave them you know and the lord and
[36:43] when i asked the lord to forgive me and
[36:45] i forgave them for like somebody threw a
[36:46] bucket of water on me
[36:48] um i remember reading the bible and it
[36:51] just started opening up to me little by
[36:53] little you know the lord started adding
[36:55] on
[36:56] and you know when i got released and i
[36:58] was going on i'm telling everybody i'll
[37:00] say they're like yeah right
[37:02] yeah i say it but they i was telling a
[37:05] lot of them i was made of mine before i
[37:07] went and turned myself in

[37:13] and the devil tried me
[37:15] you know i had a cousin
[37:16] two years ago got caught with six and a
[37:18] half kilos i could have did that back
[37:20] here i can go back where i was at

[37:38] earnest was a you know ernest was that
[37:40] guy he could come up with a plan i
[37:41] honestly thought he was trying to stick
[37:43] to church and i told him don't play with

[37:46] and before that's for i got saved and he
[37:48] was still going on and i knew he was
[37:49] saying whenever i talked to him i know
[37:51] he was straight up with if he was still
[37:52] holding on and i remember going to that
