[Music] at this time we ask everyone to if you have your bible turn to the book of ephesians chapter 6. [Music] ephesians chapter six we'll start at verse 10 when you got to say amen amen and it reads finally my brother and be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the walls of the devils for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore taken to you the whole arm of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girded about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching therefore there unto with all perseverance and and supplication for all saints amen god had a blessing to the reason of this word you may be seated amen tonight i'd like to speak on a little topic of i entitled it growth growth and really wanted it to be something simple but in here he says in verse 12 he said we were before we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the ruler of darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places and just that first part of it just realizing sometimes that when god he allows us to come to certain levels that we realize that we're not fighting against others we're fighting against principalities we're not fighting against flesh and blood but the devil is using and he's using different things to get to us he's using different situations to get to us he's using it's not the people it's the it's the devil using them and when you can look past that you can you can grow you realize there's a level of growth that you come to a level maturity that you've come to that you're not holding against a person you've come to that level and you said lord help me help me to see to see past the situation and continue to show forth with the love that you've given me for them and just coming to that level of growth that said and i liken to it i said i wrote something down i said we don't call an apple a tree we call it an apple why because even though but it has the seeds in it which has the potential to become apple trees it has the seeds in it to become it but we don't call the apple a tree we call it we call it an apple because that's the fruit of it sometimes we you don't see the tree but you but you see the fruit of it and that's how you know what the tree is because the tree has come to maturity that it can bear forth fruit the tree has come to the point where it can have fruit and it is and it has growth it has gone through its seasons it has gone through its changes it has gone through the the ups and the downs the times of the years they said if you cut a tree open and you look at the rings you can tell how much rain came that year if the ring is small it wasn't much rain but if it's fat it had a lot of rain and sometimes god's sometimes we go through seasons in life like that with it where we feel like god ain't moving god ain't blessing god ain't doing and and you can look at it and say that was just a season that was just a point in time but if i continue to grow god has got to do certain got to do more than i can think of and maybe it's not the season for that maybe it's not the opportunity for that but if i continue to grow i continue to put forth the effort i continue to plan i continue to take out all the weeds around the plant if i continue to do that this seed is going to grow if i continue to water let the sun get to it the seed is going to grow that and you look at a tree in some seasons it didn't have much water but this tree still lived the tree still continued to go on the tree didn't die it just stayed there in in in the show for the cycles of time the cycles of time that it was going through and said and we have to we have to grow in god in order for god we have to grow in order for god to take us higher we have to grow through some different things and go through some different things and come to that growth stage where god can take us to the next level well god can take us into the higher of the highest and he wants to take us there but we sometimes we're not mature enough to go there we we're not we're not on the level that god wants us to be so that we can reach where he wants to bless us we're not on the level where god wants us to be where he can put us in higher positions because we haven't grown we're still looking around we're still looking at waiting what well well i didn't get much rain but that person did over there the cloud the cloud came this far and then it stopped but i was sitting here but god god god can always move the cloud your way he can always come and give you the extra and let it blow your weight so that you can still get get the blessings of god it said i said i wrote something else i said before god can entrust us with more we have to grow you have to grow in spirit we have to grow in prayer we have to take those times out studying we got to take those times out and loving god giving him back everything that he gave to us and more david said in psalms he said if i had 10 000 tongues it wouldn't be enough to praise them all god just asked us i heard someone said recently that god god then god just asked us to praise him he didn't ask us to do anything else he just asked us to give give him glory give him and give him the praise he didn't ask us to cry he didn't ask us the whine he asked us to give him praise no matter what we're going through we can give him praise because there's always someone that's going through worse there's always if you look to your left someone may be down and out you look to your right someone may be down and up but god is keeping you god is keeping you he's growing you even through the midst of the struggles when the rain sometimes some plants die the one right next to the tree may die but god is keeping you and sustaining you to allow you to continue to grow you allow you to come through that season in a season where he can bless you even more he just and many times god just want you to stand strong stand firm in what you believe be like that tree planted by the rivers of water and you cannot be moved god god is doing so many things and i believe god wants to take us higher but we have to grow we have to get past some things we have to we have to continue to move forward so that god can do it god wants to do it i i remember the story that i heard a long time ago it said there was this man he had he had passed away and he went to heaven and and i might have told the story before but he said he went to heaven and the angel was taking him on a tour around heaven and he went past his room and the door was halfway cracked and he saw the room the wrong he glassed out the room the room was full of presents all these types of different things but the angel came and closed the door real quick and he was like what's in that room and and then when he came forward the angel finally he finally pestered the injured enough to to the point that the angel finally told him he opened up the door and he said he said this room was full of all the blessings that god wanted to give you but you wasn't ready this room was full of all the things that god had prepared for you on earth but you wasn't ready and sometimes it takes that level of growth and you come to the point where god wants to bless you but you wasn't ready you wasn't you hadn't grown enough you hadn't come through enough for god to give you the things that he wanted to give you so the lord holds them back it says in first corinthians one scripture and there first corinthians chapter 13 and verse 11. i'll turn to it chapter 13 and verse 11 paul was speaking here uh and he says when you got to say amen amen paul was speaking here he said when i was a child i spake as a child understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i'll put away childish childish things and it goes on i'll read the read the next verse he said for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and see paul paul realized there was a level that he he had to grow to just like a child when a child understands certain things and i take you back to the classroom i said you can't teach someone algebra if they don't know how to multiply you can't teach someone if they can't add it's hard for them to you you teaching them complex things that they may never understand because they don't have the basics and sometimes god has to take us and make sure that we got the basics before you can move on and if you if you never get the basics you'll never move forward and you got to take the time to learn the basics you got to take the time and studying and sometimes that's all by yourself sometimes that's with a teacher but sometimes you got to put in that alone time for yourself to grow you got to put in the time studying for yourself before you can get to the level where you can do the high level things it doesn't mean that god don't put people there to guide you it doesn't mean that he's not leading you but you got to still put forth an effort you still got to go through it and still put forth the effort so that you can grow for yourself so that you can mature and as you learn and as you grow and you go you understand things differently i i said even in my own life the person that i was five years ago and the same person today because of life experiences and things that you've gone through that you've grown amen and you gotta allow people to grow because god can do things overnight for someone and they can see sometimes sometimes we don't understand because we can't see we can't see god hasn't allowed us to see it but when it comes clear to you you can you can make a different decision you can make a different different thing that you want to do because god has allowed you to see because you've grown to the love of god said i can show you this now you've grown to the level that god said i can open this up to you now now you can now you can focus in and see it from a whole new light than what you viewed before and and i'd like to say that god is expecting a mature bride that knows who she is and the power that she possesses god is expecting us to grow to the maturity level that he can give us the power to speak things he can give us the power to move things and god can give us the power that in james he speaks about it in james chapter 1 i want to say it's changed let me turn to it and james i'm gonna paraphrase crazy because i can't find it off the top of my head i should have written it down but james he talks about it that many times we ask but we ask a miss we ask for something but we asking for the wrong thing in the wrong season and we asking for the wrong thing maybe i i liken to like the one like the season there's four seasons in order for something to live something has to die in order for something to grow something had to die before it to come before it and many times we asking for the things out of season out of out of our season we asking for the rain when we need sunshine we asking for the sunshine when we need it to rain but god wants to give us everything in the right season for our life god wants to give us everything in the time that he has allowed us to in philippians 4 13 it says i can do all things through christ that strengthens me i can do all things because god he wants us to come to the love of maturity where that he can give us the power where we can believe and possess everything that he wants us to we can believe and possess everything that he wants us to and it's it's really important to see that how god if you look back over your life you can see how god has grown you how god has matured you through time and sometimes you may not see it in the moment when you're going through it but when you look back over your life you see what god has brought you through where god has kept you from from things that seem and unseen that when you look back and say those could have been detrimental decisions detrimental decisions but god continued to move us through and continue to allow us to grow to a certain level that now we can see it we didn't understand that those were detrimental decisions because we wasn't mature enough to see it but god still allowed us to keep us and i said many times even young people understands that god puts your parents in your life for a reason because many a time they have been through things even though you think they may not understand they have been through things where they trying to lead you and guide you from making the wrong decision they try because they've grown through those things they've gone through those things so they can tell you about it even though you may not want to hear it i can even look in my life when my parents told me certain things and you know sometimes i was hard-headed so i had to figure it out for myself but then i went back and realized that they was trying to spare me from some things they was trying to lead and guide me away from some from pitfalls that the god he still kept you through it but you didn't have to go through it if you only would have listened you didn't have to go through it if you only would have listened and god pushed him there so that you don't have to grow through those he can take you through different things god can take you through different things just by listening and listening to the wisdom of the ones that are around you and just understanding that god is trying to grow you god is trying to god may put certain things in your life just to grow you he may put you in certain situations so that you can grow he may put you through certain around certain people so that you can grow god may take you out of situations that you thought were beneficial so that you can grow god may take you out of certain situations you don't understand why god is moving you and it may be for your benefits but sometimes we have the wrong attitude while we're going through it i know i've been guilty of it while you're going through that moment because you don't understand you don't understand what's going on but god is moving on your behalf behind the scenes and when you don't even like like the song says even when you don't see it he's working even when you don't believe it he's working and he never stops god never stops working because and i'm going he said he's a weight maker a miracle worker a promise keeper a light in the darkness that's who he is that's just who god is he's the one that's going to keep you through everything he's the one that's going to make sure you get the sun at the right time the rain at the right time the right nutrients at the right time he's going to let this leaves fall on the ground so that you can resurrect in the spring he's going to be the one that's going to lead and guide you he's going to grow you so that you can reach that ultimate level of perfection god is going to do that for you so that you can reach that level of perfection i want to read something that says that's the way it is with christ see we've got to get we've got to be so in love with him so when we ask for any for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit when you ask for something and god doesn't give it to you it doesn't bother you because you realize that god has a season for for you not for somebody else god may have different seasons for them and different times for their life but god got a season for you he said he said to when we ask for something he doesn't give it to us and that doesn't shake us ccy and that's the only way you can do that is to become partakers of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you partakers of his divine nature and just understanding that god has those seasons those seasons of growth the seasons of the good and the seasons of the bad it's all about how you respond to it it's all about what you take from it and how you grow from it it's all about how you plant your roots and you dig down and put your time in god's word you put your time and say lord i don't know how but you gonna bring me through it and the season even the season i think of the story of joseph where joseph had to come interpret pharaoh's dream and said you're gonna have seven years of plenty and seven years of famine but god allowed joseph to be in the right position to store up for those seasons of famine and god is allowing us in this time to have the opportunity to store up he's given us the opportunity to be in this house together one more time we've seen what it looked like when we're not able to come together but god has allowed us to come together one more time and to be in the midst of one another to give him the honor to give him the glory and the praise so we got to take advantage of it we got to use the season to grow because you never know when you don't get the opportunity too you never know when the when the rain may stop and it may slow down the rain may stop coming in the same way that you see it today god is allowing us to get there in these seasons and to grow he's allowing us to see these things there was a story about a young lady and she said she came to the prophet of god and she she said um she said she had a testimony and she and she came and she said you know i ain't what i ought to be i ain't what i want to be but one thing i'm sure of i ain't what i used to be and i and i think of how the bible says that he said i would that you'd be hot a cold because i'll spew you out of my mouth if you lukewarm to paraphrase the scripture and it's in it it's always should be a season whether you know it or not you're growing you're either dying or you're growing one of the two there is no in between you either dying or you're growing and you get to pick the choice which one you want to do you get to pick the choice to say i want to live or i want to die every every every crossroads you come to has a decision to it do you want to live or do you want to die and you make that decision which way are you going to grow you're going to grow up and you're going to grow down because every tree comes to the point where the branches that get too heavy and it falls but god allows us to decide it said we may not be where we ought to be and maybe not where we should be but we're not where we used to be god has done so much for us and allowed us to come to these seasons where we can grow we can we can see what god is doing and just in those seasons where where the rain is plentiful you got to do the most that you can you got to do the most that you can so that god can continue to move god can continue to push forward god can take us into higher places and deeper deaths in him god can allow us to reach forward and become that image of what he wants us to be that image of what he sees us to be not what we see ourselves to be not what we envision this is what i want to be and this is how i think i can become but god wants to take us into what he wants us to be he wants to grow us into into the object of of his of his divine his divine vision for our lives his divine path for our lives and he allows us to go through certain things that we can't grow to that we can we can become what it is and it's all about how we are responding how we are looking at it and many times we can have the wrong the wrong outlook on it but god can still allow those to come out for our good god can still allow those even though it may be in the season of drought god can give you just enough strength to make it to the season of plenty he can give you just enough strength to make it through to the next season he can he can persuade you on sometimes the winters are long but just know like they said they said trouble don't last always joy cometh in the morning trouble don't last always and god allows us to go through certain things so that we can't give him all the glory even in the even in the down moments we can give him glory because we know that still in those moments he's still keeping us like joe job had everything taken from him his wife even came and said the curse is god and die but he said he said naked i came into this world naked i shall return he wasn't going to turn his back onto god that even though he everything was taken from him he couldn't turn his back on the one that gave him everything he couldn't turn it even in the season of it seemed like his season of drought he wouldn't turn away from the one that gave him life he would never turn away from him he didn't know that the plenty was on the way he didn't see it he didn't see the season of blessings on the way but he in this season of draw he couldn't give up he couldn't he couldn't give up he said i'm still going to continue to grow i'm still going to continue to be this witness i'm still going to continue to be a light i'm still going to do these things i'm not going to turn my back and just turn and just die i'm not going to turn around and just die and just give up he said i'm going to continue to grow and god saw that and he honored that and he con and he gave him more than he he ever had what he ever thought that he could have because god saw his his revelation to stand firm god saw that he wanted to continue to grow even even in the midst of everything even in his season of drought and just understanding that we we are all making decisions every single day things and decisions are coming unto us that and things are happening around us and even if it may be a season of drought god can still continue to grow god can still continue to take those situations and show how he can get forth all the glory he can give forth all the praise he can give us all the honor and it's just how we approach it and how we say lord in these moments let me pray harder let me study longer let me get on my knees and get down and make sure that i got to understand that when i pray i can reach you when i get down on my knees lord i need something from you lord i i don't want to get down here just say some words lord i want to touch heaven and know that you touching back down on earth lord i want that to happen in my life each and every day every single time i pray lord i want people to know that you are in the midst that you are here with us each and every time that lord we give you the glory and the honor and all the praise lord we want you in our midst we want you to come down and move in this place move in our homes moving our cars move on our jobs lord that's what we want each and every day lord we want you to continue to grow us each and every day so that you may get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise lord and and that's that's what all that i i wanted to get across was that god can do everything that we want him to do everything that we can imagine god can do it for us but we have to come with the right the right attitude the right mental attitude towards everything that's going on around us and even realizing that no matter what god is working into our good amen [Applause] praise the lord amen god is good amen growing in grace and the power of his might amen praise god groaned in the statue of a perfect man amen praise god it takes us going from faith to virtue and knowledge and come until we can come to a place that amen with the head can come to the body amen so we thank god for his ship today without the head amen the body amen is in bad shape so we thank god for growth growth where we can subject ourselves to him it's a lot of things to said you know and i was just listening to god's power and transformation god's power to transform amen he said be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is that good acceptable and perfect world of god satan is the deformer god is the transformer are you with me so god's power amen and he's talking about the geneva seed of god and i thank god because of growth the gene seed i said on last night in mullets we're not in seed form but we're in maturity form hallelujah this is not a met sea time this is harvest time this is maturity time praise god this is not what we're talking about this is where we are hallelujah praise god we're not talking about what we want to what we're looking for we're talking about manifestation time we're talking about god hallelujah hallelujah i'm sorry sister bowie amen she was there last night amen the sister boob was shouting last night amen and mullins amen but praise god we we get what we expect and we expect god to move amen we got to pull we got to cry out to god to god i need something lord i need you i need your spirit i need your power oh holy ghost god help us when you cried for something for god i tell you god was speaking some things uh last night i wish i could share my wish which they alexis the boy tell y'all about it come on man give us a testimony she said she ain't testifying tonight praise god i can't tell it i'll let somebody else tell it amen but god did some things and god is doing some things i want you to know the enemy is working his work but god is moving is a supernatural way the word of god is right when the enemy come in like a flood the spirit of the lord will lift up a standard and i'm telling you god is lifting up a stand the power of god is here amen you just got to channel into it praise god you just got to amen praise god press your way into the power and the anointing of god because certainly he's here praise god he is here praise god god bless you today amen growing growing into maturity amen that's what god wants little by little we get there thank god for caleb tonight and thank god for each and every one of you we hadn't heard from maurice lately well i reached come and still say a few words and we haven't seen you in a while god bless you thank god for him and his family's wife back there amen children amen man praise the lord everybody amen this is we always kind of the privilege to be in the house of the lord because when we gather the house of love together with god's people and there's always something special about gathering together hearing the revelation god have for his people and using that to propel us forward in the rest of this dark and evil day uh i just kind of privileged to be able to hear our brother tonight never had the president of fear brother caleb speak but i thank god for that thought on growth because we get to a point especially with leia to see all around us where people get so comfortable and you start to look back especially how it's appropriate at the beginning of a new year where you can progress and do so many different things but you look back on your life and you don't see where the growth is taking place and people are just taking time and just going through the motions but we have to be able to look at our lives and see that growth amen and i thank god that he gives us things to help us
