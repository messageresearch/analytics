[45:46] know just as an honor to be here this
[45:49] morning with my
[45:51] family my mom dad they traveled long
[45:55] miles with all the 13 others if I
[45:59] counted right
[46:00] 12 they're here from
[46:03] Arizona and
[46:06] uh they come to sit and worship with you
[46:11] and then I have my wife sitting back
[46:13] there and my daughter
[46:15] Jubilee they they finally came with
[46:20] me and we're here but a couple months
[46:24] ago um brother Henry and I had lost
[46:29] contact um I had just preached here on a
[46:31] Sunday morning Tuesday night Wednesday
[46:35] it was a Wednesday we had an actor
[46:37] shooter situation and I kind of went off
[46:40] the
[46:41] grid and I'd like to tell you a little
[46:43] bit of that testimony on how the Lord
[46:47] was a
[46:51] protector July
[46:53] 24th um about 1:30 in the
[46:57] afternoon it was noon actually when the
[47:00] homeowner came out and talked with us
[47:02] and told us a sob story told us that he
[47:05] lost his job and I offered him another
[47:08] job told him I could help
[47:10] him and tried to help him out he said
[47:14] well I might do that and he went in the
[47:16] house and we had ate a sandwich together
[47:19] he came back out an hour later with a
[47:23] rifle and so now I was like well
[47:26] something's changed I don't know what
[47:28] happened but I see him raise the rifle
[47:30] at me and I said guys run he has a gun
[47:34] and I shoved one of the guys and next I
[47:36] know there was three rounds that went
[47:38] off striking two of my
[47:41] guys they were hit in the face and one
[47:44] in the throat fortunately it was just a
[47:47] 22 but we had to run to safety and um we
[47:52] hid for about an hour and a
[47:54] half away from a shootter
[47:58] law enforcement wouldn't go up there
[48:00] they were kind of held back until backup
[48:03] would arrive and we had no idea where
[48:05] the shooter was because it's small
[48:07] caliber
[48:09] rifle no one knew where he went and all
[48:12] we heard is reports of people getting
[48:15] shot at and people getting shot
[48:18] and by God's grace there was only three
[48:20] people that were shot through the whole
[48:22] thing everybody survived
[48:27] and you know Dustin the one that was
[48:29] shot in the throat he was in the
[48:32] hospital for about 3 and a half
[48:34] months um on a
[48:38] ventilator doctors at first didn't
[48:41] expecting to uh survive they um they
[48:45] said well if he makes it out of this
[48:47] it's going to be a
[48:49] miracle I went in the hospital room with
[48:53] Dustin and I stood next to him and
[48:56] Dustin looked sent me can't
[48:59] speak and he says
[49:02] pray I said I
[49:05] will he said no
[49:09] now I need you to pray
[49:12] now I grabbed his hand my boss walked in
[49:16] the
[49:18] room and I took his hand and I started
[49:20] to pray as only I knew
[49:25] how I watched the Lord Lord just come
[49:27] and bring more strength to
[49:29] him Dustin's walking right now he's
[49:38] talking it's not what I can do my Bible
[49:41] told me lay my hands on the sick and
[49:44] they shall
[49:48] recover it's not just for the
[49:52] preacher if you believe the word amen
[49:56] you can do it to
[49:57] am yes Dustin right now he he's not able
[50:02] to work he doesn't need to work he got a
[50:05] big
[50:07] settlement
[50:09] but his strength is slowly coming
[50:12] back he's slowly being able to talk
[50:16] more he starts to wear a neck
[50:19] brace because his muscles the bullet got
[50:23] lodged in his vertebrae
[50:26] and he he isn't able to really lift his
[50:29] head and put it down as we
[50:33] can Salvador the other one that was shot
[50:35] in the
[50:37] face he said the doctor told me that it
[50:40] was a miracle that and he said God is
[50:44] real and I said how'd the bullet strike
[50:48] you he said when I was facing this way
[50:52] my side profile the bullet came in and
[50:54] went in his face right here
[50:57] and ricocheted off his cheekbone and
[50:59] went out his
[51:01] nose he said the doctor they've had many
[51:05] 22 bullet patients come
[51:08] in and most of them have been
[51:12] fatal they said because the bullet from
[51:14] a 22 if anyone knows the trajectory of a
[51:17] weapon of of uh
[51:20] bullets they 22 will actually Ricochet
[51:23] off the bones in your body they'll
[51:25] Ricochet off the vertebraes they ricet
[51:27] off
[51:28] everything the muscles they it's just a
[51:31] small caliber
[51:33] bullet and that bullet the doctor said
[51:37] if it wasn't for the grace of God you
[51:38] wouldn't be here today cuz that bullet
[51:41] from the direction it went in should
[51:43] have went rade off the bone up to your
[51:46] brain but he said it went out your nose
[51:49] he said the only explanation I know is
[51:52] that God was in the
[51:54] midst now before
[51:57] before this would even
[52:00] happen um we had been talking about the
[52:04] Lord before the shooting ever even
[52:07] happened and I I I never really recalled
[52:10] that until
[52:12] afterwards that we were over here
[52:14] actually sitting and talking about the
[52:18] word and we took about 5
[52:21] minutes after we cleared this road out
[52:24] and we took those 5 minutes to talk and
[52:26] drink drink of water we started talking
[52:28] about the Lord and that's when I seen
[52:30] the shooter come out I said guys he has
[52:31] a gun run the only explanation I know is
[52:35] that he was in the
[52:38] midst the prophet of God would tell us
[52:40] that when we would talk about the Lord
[52:43] he comes
[52:46] near and that's the only explanation I
[52:49] know but the whole time that I was in
[52:51] that middle of
[52:53] that uh situation
[52:57] when an enemy was coming in like a flood
[53:00] there was only some things that I had on
[53:02] my mind was I need to get home and see
[53:05] my
[53:08] family that one that sang dad dad back
[53:11] there I wanted to see her that's the
[53:15] only one I could think about is Jubilee
[53:17] and
[53:18] Rachel There Was You Know Not Another
[53:20] care in
[53:21] my in my mind is I wanted to go be able
[53:25] to be with them
[53:27] but I just want to give all the grace
[53:29] and all the honor and all the
[53:32] praise to our Lord and Savior Jesus

[1:18:32] do and they tell you what they going to
[1:18:37] do are you with me and the said okay
[1:18:45] baby yes honey
[1:18:48] child is that teaching them
[1:18:51] anything amen and you wonder why the
[1:18:55] church is out of
[1:18:57] order cuz the house is out of
[1:19:06] order sometime we don't allow amen the
[1:19:10] man to be the
[1:19:13] head cuz the woman won't allow
[1:19:19] him are you with
[1:19:22] me see people are not subject to the
[1:19:25] word
[1:19:27] wow and when you give the people the
[1:19:30] word they don't want the word so the
[1:19:32] head can never come to the body because
[1:19:34] they're not
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:39] together when the head comes to the body
[1:19:42] amen the body got to be
[1:19:44] right because God is not going to be
[1:19:47] unequally yolked together wow with a
[1:19:50] dominating female come on a church that
[1:19:54] want a Domin over the
[1:19:56] word are you with me amen if you want to
[1:20:00] do your own
[1:20:01] [Applause]
[1:20:03] thing and not be subject to the
[1:20:06] word then get another
[1:20:10] Bible amen are you with me
[1:20:13] amen but if you believe that the
[1:20:16] [Applause]
[1:20:18] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:20:21] Amen yes and the God is amen you must
[1:20:25] amen let him be Lord ruler over you amen
[1:20:30] you don't tell the word what to do the
[1:20:32] word tell
[1:20:33] you what to do amen are you with me
[1:20:38] amen but the Bible says we workers
[1:20:41] together with him amen we ought to work
[1:20:44] together with him amen amen amen the
[1:20:49] husband and the wife should
[1:20:51] be one amen so so if you one you got no
[1:20:56] problem amen are you with me the problem
[1:21:00] is there is division in God's house amen
[1:21:04] because there's a Visions in the
[1:21:06] home when you go home there's a vision
[1:21:11] amen amen God can never come down and
[1:21:16] have
[1:21:18] preeminence in uh th Tyra because
[1:21:22] Jezebel was a dominating f
[1:21:26] male are you with
[1:21:28] me she dominated
[1:21:32] AAL and the spirit of Jezebel has come
[1:21:36] in this leot ofy of age the church want
[1:21:39] to dominate over the word amen are you
[1:21:42] with me so we must become subject to him
[1:21:47] who is our head for Christ is the head
[1:21:51] of the church church amen and he wants
[1:21:55] the preeminence over the body am amen
[1:21:59] somebody said where he
[1:22:02] leads is that
[1:22:04] right the Bible say they that are led by
[1:22:07] the spirit of God they
[1:22:09] are on
[1:22:10] now are you with me amen so you must
[1:22:14] allow Jesus to lead you amen you know we
[1:22:18] say I do what I feel like
[1:22:22] doing you're not living by amen what you
[1:22:27] feel the just shall live
[1:22:32] by the restored order amen is
[1:22:37] identifying the restitution of all
[1:22:39] things as the Seed of Abraham amen and
[1:22:44] the Bible calls us Seed of Abraham we're
[1:22:47] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[1:22:50] amen are you with me amen not outside
[1:22:53] but inside
[1:22:55] amen I said Eve was in Adam and Adam and
[1:22:58] Eve was one amen as long as Eve stayed
[1:23:01] in Adam she could not sin am yes but
[1:23:05] being a
[1:23:07] byproduct praise God she got out of
[1:23:10] order that's why he said Adam was not
[1:23:12] deceived but the woman being deceived
[1:23:15] was in the
[1:23:16] transgression oh don't you picking on
[1:23:19] women you got to stop it what do they
[1:23:22] call them male shinness or whatever I
[1:23:25] don't know what they call it you talking
[1:23:27] about the church now y get they get
[1:23:29] spiritual
[1:23:30] minded amen y'all sister get get
[1:23:33] spiritual amen we talking about the
[1:23:37] church get in the spirit amen don't get
[1:23:40] don't get
[1:23:41] offended
[1:23:43] please amen but the natural types of
[1:23:49] spiritual are you with me so when we
[1:23:52] find ourselves amen not being subject to
[1:23:55] the word then that is the spirit of the
[1:23:58] Antichrist which is against the
[1:24:01] word are you with me amen and we know
[1:24:04] that that spirit amen was just the
[1:24:07] spirit of the nickol and became a deed
[1:24:10] and becomes a Doctrine and then it ends
[1:24:14] up being a
[1:24:17] union taking
[1:24:20] on incarnate itself in a man
[1:24:24] are you with me amen so we understand
[1:24:27] that the order amen there's a spirit
[1:24:30] that's leading the false Vine and the
[1:24:33] True Vine
[1:24:35] amen amen so there a spirit that the
[1:24:39] world Amen is being led
[1:24:42] by I never seen Christians get so in
[1:24:48] politics believe in the LI
[1:24:50] all politics is of the devil and being
[1:24:53] led by the devil
[1:24:54] amen Republican Democrats and whoever
[1:24:58] don't even get caught up in that
[1:25:00] mess all of is of the devil I'm a Dem

[1:25:18] get mad because you this and that that
[1:25:20] my kingdom is not of this
[1:25:22] world Amen amen what we get so caught up
[1:25:28] in things that don't matter to a a true
[1:25:30] Bor child of God Amen when you're in
[1:25:33] order you these things amen are just
[1:25:37] temporary things amen are you with me
[1:25:40] but the things of God Eternal so let's
[1:25:43] not get caught up in these temporal
[1:25:45] things let's look at the Eternal thing
[1:25:48] now restore order he said when the time
[1:25:50] of restitution shall come he he going to
[1:25:53] send forth Jesus Christ which were

[1:37:38] finest understanding of what truth
[1:37:41] is are you with me because they have
[1:37:45] already complicated even the English
[1:37:50] language amen and he said we need a male
[1:37:53] nor female neither Bor or free but we
[1:37:56] all
[1:37:59] one and they oh Lord they take the
[1:38:03] scriptures and twist it so bad come on
[1:38:06] are you with me yeah they make the the
[1:38:10] English language as though it doesn't
[1:38:15] exist because it doesn't pertain to the
[1:38:18] way I say so we interpret the English
[1:38:23] language with our own twist
[1:38:26] to it used to be a time when people
[1:38:29] respected the
[1:38:31] Bible being the King James
[1:38:34] virgin but there are so made so many
[1:38:38] virgins to the people are so
[1:38:42] confused are you with me at one time we
[1:38:46] just had one Bible most people looked
[1:38:48] and
[1:38:49] read now people have come to church and
[1:38:52] they got the living Bible the new Bible
[1:38:56] the oh goodness New World Translation
[1:39:00] this kind of translation everybody come
[1:39:03] with a different Bible and then the
[1:39:04] preacher go to preach he said I'm trying
[1:39:06] to preach out all 26 or 00
[1:39:09] different by the time you get to one
[1:39:12] scripture it's time for people to go cuz
[1:39:15] they can't stay for 15
[1:39:18] minutes are you with me so we're out of
[1:39:22] order
[1:39:24] but the people uh been this out of order
[1:39:27] so long till you try to get them back in
[1:39:29] order what they
[1:39:31] doing they've been out of order so you
[1:39:34] you try to get things back in order
[1:39:36] people are upset cuz they've been out of
[1:39:38] order so long they think
[1:39:41] H what are you trying to
[1:39:44] do are you with me you know when people
[1:39:48] have been bound up so long when you try
[1:39:51] to get them free from the B
[1:39:55] you know it somethings like
[1:39:57] a anim been caged up so
[1:40:02] long you take the cage and lift it
[1:40:05] up and the cage is
[1:40:08] gone the animal still right there
[1:40:10] running around in that
[1:40:11] Circle because they think the bars are
[1:40:14] still there they don't got used to that
[1:40:18] place often time we get used to where we
[1:40:21] are
[1:40:24] that when God takes the amen uh takes
[1:40:27] the bar away again get it out of out of
[1:40:30] that bondage we've been Amen in such a
[1:40:33] mindset for so
[1:40:35] long to when God comes to free
[1:40:39] you amen we cannot deal with
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:45] freedom are you with me so I I I'm
[1:40:48] saying this morning be
[1:40:51] careful that what you accustomed
[1:40:55] to amen has thrown you so far out of
[1:40:59] order that God's blessings cannot come
[1:41:03] upon you and the things that God has for
[1:41:06] you he cannot give it to
[1:41:09] you because you are
[1:41:13] order are you with
[1:41:17] me so by the grace of God God want to
[1:41:19] bless the people with abundancy of
[1:41:22] blessings
[1:41:23] God want to give you so much joy and so
[1:41:27] much God wants to explode on the scene
[1:41:30] give you a double potion of his Spirit
[1:41:33] but he cannot do it he had to hold it
[1:41:34] back because things got to be right if
[1:41:37] you get it you blow
[1:41:39] up amen because you can't take
[1:41:44] it are you with
[1:41:46] me I believe that we're living in this
[1:41:49] hour where he says he promised to
[1:41:52] restore all things are you with me and I
[1:41:57] believe all things have been
[1:41:59] restored but people don't recognize the
[1:42:02] restoration of all things are you with
[1:42:05] me we're in the hour long
[1:42:11] ago people felt like they were
[1:42:15] restored they felt good they were

[1:42:20] amen it was Revival striking the nation
[1:42:23] in the
[1:42:24] world and people were so
[1:42:27] excited but we got to a point people got
[1:42:30] plenty
[1:42:31] money and they forgot
[1:42:35] God
[1:42:36] Amen when people didn't have much they
[1:42:39] serve the Lord people got plenty of
[1:42:43] money they didn't need the Lord no more
[1:42:46] they figure what they got God was
[1:42:48] blessing them and God knew them and they
[1:42:49] knew God because they were looking at
[1:42:52] the things they present
[1:42:54] and that's what people do they look at
[1:42:56] what they got and they determine God
[1:42:58] being with
[1:43:00] them and God blessing them so they
[1:43:03] measure God by the things that they
[1:43:07] have are you with me y'all all right
