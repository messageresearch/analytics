[music] [music] Amen. [music] [music] Press your way out tonight in Jesus Christ's name. I love you, Lord. Amen. and appreciate songs and musicians and thank God for everyone. Let us just bow our heads in a word [music] of prayer. If you have a special need, you can just lift your hand to the Lord. Certainly kind heavenly father. Lord, [music] we know that you're God. And Lord, words cannot express [music] how we love you. And thank you for watching over us and keeping us. And Lord, I just pray tonight, Lord, that flesh would be moved back out of the way. You would say something that will lift your people, [music] that would strengthen your people and encourage your people. Lord [music] God, I pray that you look upon every need, those on the prayer list, sick and afflicted. Lord, touch bodies, Lord. uh but Madonna and brother John Lord and all the different ones Lord God I pray that you'll move in their lives Father I just pray that you help every individual Lord God every family every home meet every need according to your riches and glory bless your word tonight in Jesus [music] Christ's name amen Revelation third chapter. We thank God said we need revelation more than anything. And we thank God that he's given us a message. Amen. that has opened the word, the Bible up in a greater way. So we thank God for that. The Revelation 4, I mean 3 and 14. 3 and 14. Unto the angel of the church to lay out a seal, write these things, said, "Amen." The faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works, that thou are neither cold nor hot. I would, thou were cold or heart. So then, because thou are lukewarm, neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I'm rich and increased with goods, and have neither nothing. and knowest not that thou are wretched, miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I cancel thee to bow me gold tried in the fire that thou may be rich and that and white remnant that thou may be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with thyself that thou may see. As many as I love I rebuke and chasen. Beious therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I would come in unto him and I would suck with him and he with me. God bless you. Read his word. You may receive. I said, I probably got the heat all the way up. It's burning up up here. I know Gordon was hot. But y'all feel comfortable out there, don't you? But you still can turn it over on that side. But by the grace of God, uh, the key to the door, the key to the door. And I know as we look in the book of Revelation, we know that Christ on the outside of the church knocking on the door. But we want to deal with the individual, you and I, as Christ knocks on the door. And we want to look at it as Christ being the the door, the key to the door. And we know the key to the door is faith. We use the key to lock or to unlock. Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; But as God's servant said, the church has lost the key. The church has lost the key. Faith is the key, but the church has lost the key. And as a whole, we see things are not happening in folks lives because they have lost the key. And faith is the key that unlocks the door. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We're living in an age where people are trying to believe. They're trying to say, "I believe God." And they're trying to do all they can do. As I said in Mullins last night, they people say, "Well, I said, "Who want to be saved?" And if the sermon or the anointing is kind of high, you'll find people that's been saved 20, 30 years, raise their hand because they want to be saved. They want to give your life to the Lord. They want to give their life. Maybe things are just not right or happening and they're not where they want to be or they need to be in the Lord. So they raise their hand because they come under some type of conviction. You know, I I feel I feel compelled just to lift my hand cuz I I but you know it it it it's time that we don't raise our hand to uh uh to accept the Lord because if we done that, we don't need to continue continue accepting him. We need to believe that we have received. &gt;&gt; True. Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And we need to praise him for saving us. And I believe that's the key. Sometimes we don't praise him and thank him enough from saving us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you keep on thanking the Lord for saving you, you won't be doubting your salvation. &gt;&gt; But you begin to praise the Lord, I thank you for saving me. You know, if you get baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ, you know, the people used to have to get up and where we came from and they would say, "Thank the Lord. I praise the Lord. I've been baptized in according to Acts 2:38 in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of my sin." And then went and spoke with tongues and evidence. You know what I'm saying? But, you know, it was a it was a repetitious thing. every prayer pray praise service they get up and they said and you got to say you've been baptized in Jesus Christ's name according to Acts 2:38 if you didn't say that something is missing okay but by the grace of God I find that we must meditate on the word we must speak faith we must speak the word we must say it is very important that you said you tell God thank you for saving and you get up in the morning. Praise the Lord. Lord, thank you for another day. Thank you for saving me. Lord, thank you for filling me with the Holy Ghost. Lord, thank you. Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; But failure to express it. And that's what happens many time. People don't express [snorts] and thank God enough. Now, Jesus died on the cross. I'm not going to stop. went to the audience last night, but I'm not going to do that tonight. But uh people uh have started and on their journey and when they start on the journey, a lot of times they don't they don't continue. They stop somewhere. Let's go to the book of Jude 5. And he says, "I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you once knew this, how that the Lord having what? &gt;&gt; Save the people." &gt;&gt; Saved the people out of the land of Egypt, after he what? &gt;&gt; Destroyed them that what? Believe not. See, you got to keep on believing. You can't stop believing. &gt;&gt; See, they never made it where what they never received the full promise of God. They started the journey but they did not complete the journey because they start doubting. Maybe I will do it. I have to walk away and then I have to get somebody to read for me if I walk away. Well, by the grace of God, often times people start on the journey and they start with faith, but after a period of time, they stop believing. Are you with me? The prophet of God said, "People come on the uh pull pit and they get prayer and they were blind and the eyes come open and by the time they get to the seat, they blind again." And my question was, what happens? What causes that blind person, Amen, to see on the pullpit and by the time they get in their seat, they blind again, but their eyes were open. What happened between on the coming through the prayer line getting prayer and the eyes they received their sight they were blind and they get to the seat and they bl and they can and the I mean they were the eyes were open and they get to the seat and they blind again. What happened? What causes that? &gt;&gt; Anybody? &gt;&gt; Huh? They doubted because what happens to folks that raise their hand? God, you [laughter] know, the Lord save them. You know, we the devil can't take your salvation from you, can he? &gt;&gt; But you sure can give it to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You said, you say, "The joy that I had, the world didn't give it, and the world can't take it from me." &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're saved, you must believe that, Amen. God didn't come just only to save, but take you into the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost is joy, unspeakable, and full of glory. &gt;&gt; And you see, BUT IF YOU DON'T GET [screaming] THERE, AMEN. IT'S NOT GOD FAULT. IT'S YOUR FAITH. When your faith stopped, Amen. Your Amen. Your blessings won't flow like they ought to flow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, sometime it's not that the promised land is not there. The promised land was there, but they begin to doubt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything God promised you and I. And everything THAT JESUS DIED for is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's already been bought and purchased and paid for. Amen. The abstract TITLE DEED HAS BEEN IT CAME BACK. AMEN. OH, HALLELUJAH. AND GOD HAS given you. AMEN. THAT SAME BLESSINGS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT ADAM HAD [screaming] IN the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's saying that you are THE REDEEMED OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; To redeem TO BE BROUGHT BACK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO GOD WANT TO BRING YOU BACK in the original condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you see the last thing we're waiting on the redemption of our bodies, BUT IT'S ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT. WE'RE SET TOGETHER now in heavenly places IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; WE ALREADY HAVE arrived in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE THERE? &gt;&gt; YOUR FAITH MUST AMEN. HAVE YOU RESTED IN KNOWING OF ASSURITY THAT I'M IN HEAVENLY PLACES? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU DOUBT THAT, YOU'LL NEVER BE THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But it's something about a believer. A believer. Amen. Experience the things that God promised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, faith cannot be defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you have And when you have faith in God, you don't have to waver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can if you know Amen. If you know your house been paid off or your car been paid off and you have the title deed to it. Amen. Praise God. And then they they say, "Well, you owe $10,000 [screaming] on this house." You said, "I done paid THIS THING OFF. I got the deed. Amen. &gt;&gt; They said, "WELL, YOU OWE $1,000 on this car." You said, "I got the deed to prove that I Amen. It's been paid off." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you know that JESUS HAS PAID THE PRICE WITH HIS OWN BLOOD AND YOU KNOW HE SHED IT AND YOU KNOW, AMEN. PRAISE GOD IS NO charges against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THE DEVIL COME AGAINST YOU, [screaming] YOU GOT YOU GOT LEGAL RIGHTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You got REDEMPTIVE RIGHTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A RIGHT TO TELL THE DEVIL, [screaming] "GET OFF MY PROPERTY." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GET OFF OF HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] DON'T BELONG HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's why Jesus said, "Get behind me, Satan." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you got that. But if you Well, see, we act like we little babies. [clears throat] Well, Lord, you know, pastor, please pray for me. I feel so bad and I don't know whether or not I can make it no father. You know, it's hard. I'm having struggles. I'm having battles and I can't hardly make it. Oh, [laughter] I believe I can't help it. My [snorts] mind tell me we ain't going by your mind. &gt;&gt; A believer faith come by what? &gt;&gt; Hearing. &gt;&gt; And hearing come by what? &gt;&gt; Word of God. &gt;&gt; The word says you heal. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE WORD says you are delivered. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word say you're the head and not the tail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're a lender and not the borrower. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did that is that the word? &gt;&gt; What? Whose report will you believe? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, SO LONG YOU'VE been holding your head down because you're not legally it's not legally yours because your faith has not been anchored. Your approach to God has been wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You approach with God by unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you actually don't really believe that Jesus did what he said he did. &gt;&gt; But if you believe that he died for your sins and that Amen. all you got TO DO IS ACCEPT WHAT HE DID FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RECEIVE IT in your not in your head but in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe from the heart. You got me, brother. Going 10. Romans 10. Believe in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT UH OFTEN TIME WE BELIEVE in our head and not in our heart. SO WE STILL STRUGGLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE STILL BATTLE. AM I SAVED? NOW WHAT CAN YOU DO TO SAVE YOURSELF? &gt;&gt; What did you do to save yourself? &gt;&gt; What can you do TO PROVE TO YOURSELF THAT I'M SAVED NOW? [screaming] &gt;&gt; I I FINALLY GOT SAVED. WHAT? HOW? [laughter] MOSES, if Jesus was right here, sitting right here where Ma Josiah sitting and you needed something from Jesus and you needed to be healed and you asked Jesus to heal you, what would Jesus say? &gt;&gt; You're already healed. [laughter] God wing it up. [laughter] He got me. [laughter] Y'all don't understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you asked Jesus to do something and he said, "I can't do it." Why? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS FINISHED 2,000 YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; THE SAME WAY WITH YOUR SINS. YOUR SINS WEREN'T FORGIVEN 2,000 years ago. Why you asking me to DO SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY DONE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's up to you to BELIEVE THAT I DONE WHAT I SAID. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

I ain't got no pain medicine in the house." I said, "Well, Lord Jesus, some I said, I got to believe. I'm preaching this faith. I got to have it." Oh, don't the devil test you. &gt;&gt; He'll test you. He'll try you. Amen. I had to keep on saying, "I'm healed. I'm healed." I said, "Praise the Lord. I'm healed." [laughter] &gt;&gt; And the pain got worse and sleepless nights come. I'm down on my knees crying out. Lord, I'm praying for everybody. I forgot about praying for myself because I, you know, uh, with all this pain, ain't no use in trying to sleep. Too much pain. So, I'm praying for everybody. So, I just said, "Thank the Lord." And I'm healed. I have to convince myself that I'm healed cuz this pain tell me I ain't healed. &gt;&gt; But, I HAVE TO CONVINCE MYSELF WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE THE WORD OR NOT.

Amen. So God because of his love, he could feel what you feel &gt;&gt; because he loved love a an unlovable people, people that you know, people that didn't deserve to be loved because we were enemies in our mind by wicked works. But Christ died for the &gt;&gt; ungodly. He He died when we Amen. We don't see we we think THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

Every time your head look like it's about to go down, you lift your head up high and say, "Hallelujah." Anyhow, &gt;&gt; praise God. Thank God for all the good things that he's done. All the blessings that he's done. Don't Amen. DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE, BUT THANK GOD FOR WHAT HE'S ALREADY given you. &gt;&gt; Amen.
