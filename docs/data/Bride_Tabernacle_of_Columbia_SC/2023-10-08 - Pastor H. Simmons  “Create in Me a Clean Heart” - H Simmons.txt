children now in Jesus Christ's name bless your word have preeminence now in Jesus name amen thank God for its goodness I wish I knew that song for his goodness amen you know that they sang it over North Main but let us go to Psalms 51 if you will would you stand reread the first seven verse I'll read the first you'll read next and we'll read seven verse together God is good sh somebody hand and tell them God bless you brother sister amen now turn around and Shake somebody hand God bless you brother sister is all right amen God is good Psalms 51 have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of thy tender Mercy blot out my transgressions too find knowledge my transgressions and my sins is able before thee for behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin that my mother concede me six together Purge me with hisp that I shall be clean wash me that I may be right as snow God bless you to read word you may be seated as I continue to read okay we're going to continue to read the eth verse it says make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou H has broken May Rejoice how thy face for my sins and blot out all of my iniquities create in me a clean heart let us say that together in me a clean heart a right spirit amen my topic this morning created me a clean heart then he says after that is done he said cast me not away from thy presence and take not that Holy Spirit from me then he says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit and then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee so this morning the 10th verse says create in me a clean heart now I was just praying I was going a different route and just praying this morning God what would you have me to say and just came so vividly in my spirit created me a clean heart I see what she the last time Rachel put up a little thing I didn't see it this time I see it created me a clean heart amen I I trust that each and every one of us still need to have a clean heart it's it is told that David had sinned and he had took another man's wife and lied with her and and sent the man out to battle and had him killed and so forth and then the prophet Nathan came to David and told him about a man had plenty of lambs and so forth and one man just had one shoe L and he took the man one and then it was told that David says somebody to do something like that that man ought to die and Nathan took and says David you're the man so in this song it typifies the condition David saw himself in and I said as a sinner we all have seen ourselves in that kind of condition amen yes and sometimes even as we walk this Christian walk we find ourselves sometimes Amen in in in a place where we need repentance so I want to try to work with parts of this song for a little bit and trust that it would do something for us and our walk our Christian walk we can understand the David the man supposed toly after God's Own Heart now David was a man just like you and I he went through things and had problems but yet God used him to destroy a bear and a lion and Goliath won many victories he was a warrior so much and so when Jesus Christ was called the son of David are you with me so David amen he can relate that God put him on a high standard a high pedicle God saw in David the qualities but yet David wasn't perfect yet David had all kind of things that was going on in his life David had problems amen he had battles he had to fight within himself amen he was de he dealt with situations and problem that he had to face though he was God's anointed though he was chosen and though God wanted him to be king though God gave him so many victories and blessed him so much sometimes in God's blessing sometime we get a little up the road in our Christian walk and sometimes things happen in our lives amen sometimes we lose Victory he won the battles out there being a warrior but the victory within himself sometimes we lose that maybe we want the victory over uh drugs and alcohol and you know things like that but we lose victory in other areas amen each and every one of us have our own failures and our own successes so it it's things that we must conquer in ourselves that is our truth from the inward part things within us that we have to fight things within us that we got to get Victory and got to conquer and got to overcome you and every one of us to deal with dealt with different situations your problem and your thing that go you are fighting and your battle may not be mine but each and every one of us have things that we have to face we must conquer we must repent of sometimes our repentances are constantly repenting the Bible says we must confess our faults one to another amen if we conf confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sin amen are you with me but I believe that David dealt with true repentance he realized that the best hands that I'm goingon to fall in I rather fall in the hands of if I fall in the hands of man that I'm going be in bad shape so Nathan said who hand in other words who you want to judge you he said you know you can't let your enemies you can't let your friend I want let God judge me you know and I I believe each and every one of us know God is a just judge and he judged fairly amen now I might in my best interest and no matter how much I love you and care for you I might if I had to do the judg and I might make a mistake I might let one go free and the other one I might oh give the DraStic you know but if I let God do the judging I knew he he knows what each and everyone uh uh needs to be corrected amen because God don't judge us just to uh punish us but God amen bring judgment that we might be corrected amen he allows amen uh things amen that come forth and the rod of Correction so you wonder why you face certain Tas and certain trials certain tribulations certain things you go through in life because God knows what it takes to mold your character am because in this age I keep saying this is the age of perfection God won't settle with nothing less than being perfect God don't want a a a a church that's imperfect it it's a church without spot ranker or blemish or any such thing God deals with Holiness and he's requiring Holiness he he's required you to be holy to be perfect uh nobody's perfect but that's what God required be you perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect are you with me and nobody it's Worf it h pardon me if God is requiring it it must be possible if God said be then he must it must be a way in which we can be perfect so David here faced a problem he said behold I was shapen in iniquity and sin that my mother conceived me in other words I was born a sinner every one of us been Born Sinner had nothing to do with it but because of Adam's sin all have sinned and come short of the glory of God we were born wrong that's why Jesus said except a man be born again again he cannot enter to the kingdom of God am yes amen so we all have need to be born again are you with me so the situation in our lives that we come before God we all can look at it and say Lord I need help Pride will cause you not to receive help and not to cry out I need help when we got a proud Spirit Esau amen sold his Birthright yes Cain killed evil because he couldn't not he wouldn't repent he wouldn't say I'm sorry Lord I I what I bought was wrong I want to do right came amen and that same Spirit today people often times are are are settled with failure when they can have success you know many times God said I made you the head and not the tail I made you the lender not the borer but because we are borrowers and not lenders and because we are tails are not the head that don't mean that's God's way of doing things God said I I want to bless you amen but God cannot bless you when you're cursing yourself amen amen amen are you up man when you cursing yourself how can God bless you are you with me but if you want to be blessed then God wants to bless you but many times we settle with our condition this is the way I am God don't want you to be the way you are he said I am the Potter you are the clay am you said Lord mold me and make me what you want me to be you know what what I need you know how what you want Lord and you want me to be perfect and God you so David says Purge me with his he said behold th desire truth from the inward part and in the hidden part thou shall make make me to know wisdom Purge me with hiss and I shall be what clean wash me and I shall be what if God does it see David had no means he knew I can't I can't help myself I can't help myself I realize how unclean I am but I cannot wash myself I cannot not clean myself so I ask you to do it see sometimes we have to ask God God I realize how sinful I am I I I'm undone Isaiah says I'm a man with unclean lips and I dwell among a people of uncleanness but Isaiah ask the Lord when the year King oai died he said I saw the Lord he was high and lifted up and his Twain did fill the temple amen when Isaiah saw his condition he realized how holy God was and how he was a man that's unclean lips he needed help God I need help yes and then the Lord took some cold from The Altar and he touched my lip amen God need to take some cold from The Altar and touch you when we see our condition God fire from The Altar and touch you God may you touch somebody this morning if you touch Isaiah God can you touch me amen I I'm undone if you can do it for them God do it for me God can do it for David what about you and I that he can make me wider than snow what is that we said what can wash amen nothing J nothing but the blood of Jesus Amen so that's what that's what we're dealing with the blood of Jesus without that blood we cannot be made wi of this snow back then David was asking of God to do something for him that only could be done through the blood of Jesus Amen David could get a temporary fix amen but to be made WI and snow amen I want to be clean up the Bible said you clean Through The Words which I spoken unto you he said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is true Lord if I'm going be clean up I you got something to clean me well we got to be washed in the Water by the word are you with me amen the word can clean you doesn't matter how dir to you are how filthy you are the word can clean you up and if you want to be washed Amen in the blood amen you come to the right place to be washed not because you're in this building but the place that God is dealing with at your heart are you with me he said make me to hear Joy the eth verse and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sin and blot out all of my iniquities right creating what not somebody else but I want you to create in me every now and then we got to look at ourselves the Bible says examine yourself and see whether you be in the faith or not look at your own self don't look at your brother's fault or your sister's fault or somebody else but let me see me can I look in the mirror and see my condition and can I come to a place that God I need help God I need you it's areas of my walk my spiritual walk that I need I need help but we all can walk out of here as go amen the word didn't affect me I was all right I'm already I'm I'm a Christian I'm saved I'm Sanctified I'm Holy Ghost filled I'm five baptized I'm all right right but I believe God can touch each and every one of us from the pull pit to the back door amen I I believe we all need help I believe we all got something that we said God have mercy on me God I need help I need you to forgive me Lord I need help Lord have mercy on me Lord sometimes we hit a a s we Justified as though we never done it and I and I often times say you done it yeah you done it you need help to stop doing it are you with me but if you Justified though you never done it you keep on doing it are you with me no place for repentance but I believe the gospel got to be simple sometime we put it way up there but people ain't got there yet are you with me simplify I believe blessed is the man whom the Lord would not impute iniquity a sin amen yeah that's all right but the man coming this way he's coming the repentance way creating me a clean heart oh God and what after God clean you up you can't get the right Spirit until you get clean first create in me a clean heart till your heart ready for it if your heart ain't ready for God you can confess with your mouth all you want but you got to believe in your heart before you can be saved because if you don't believe it in your heart you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus Christ but he said you got to believe it in your heart amen you got to see the need of a savior you got to recognize that I'm a center I need salvation I want to be saved what happens the people jump over salvation and jump into Perfection the message they leave the principles and they go to Perfection but we got to get the principles right if you don't get Jesus right you ain't going nowhere your life always going to be full of ups and downs twists and turns and Lord God it's going to be a messy R but if you get the foundation right amen he said if the foundation be destroyed what can the righteous do that's righten are you with me but we get it right if I come to Jesus the right way if I acknowledge my transgression if I tell God I need you Lord I'm a sinner I need I need to meet him at Calvary I I might I I didn't want to do it but I might do it anyway huh killer I wish you had your mic on help me out a little Leviticus 4 you got it oh you got his mic on okay Leviticus 4 I'm just something I was going through this morning and one and it reads and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying a soul shall sin through a ignorance against any of The Commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done and shall do against any of them if the priest that is Anointed do sin according to the sin of the people then let him bring for his sin which he has send a young Bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering and he shall bring the bulock unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord and shall lay his hand upon the Bullock's head and kill the bulock before the Lord and the priest that is Anointed shall take the Bullock's blood and bring it to the Tabernacle of the congregation and the priest shall dip his fingers in the blood and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord before the veil of the sanctuary and the priest shall put his put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar a sweet incense before the Lord which is in the Tabernacle of the congregation and shall pour all the blood of the bulock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering which is at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation I'm going tell you something the priest if you sin and you bring the Bullock to the priest this Bullock is taking your place it's your sin the animal didn't do nothing if you bring the lamb and you bring it before the priest and give it to the priest the animal didn't do nothing then he talked about it you bring two birs two doves and he said now you took take one and you kill one and you take the blood of that one that you killed and you dip the other one in the blood are you with me and then you let it go away after you dip it in the blood amen you let it go see after you dipped in the blood of Jesus to wash you make you clean then you can go free are you with me but somebody had to die for your sin and you had to be clean and forgiven of your sin that's only through the blood of Jesus you can go free amen the Bullock took your place Jesus took your place as a sinner he died for your sins he didn't know no sin but he died in your place amen I don't know how many people saved and have not come to recognize what Jesus did for them they don't recognize what the cross mean what Calvary means but once you realize that I couldn't help myself but because of Jesus the Lamb of God he take away the SS of the world nothing I can do nothing that I've done but he did it for me he died in my place amen yes are you with me Jesus died in your place all your sins are forgiven amen if you receive what he's done for you Lord are you with me back to a song but the problem is we battle we battle with unsolved things we we're not sure whether or not we uh uh H our Salvation is paid in full we don't feel like we done enough we don't feel comfortable saying that I'm a Christian we don't feel comfortable enough to say that I'm saved you will never feel comfortable enough to say that you're saved unless and you see amen what who saved you you have problem with people getting saved every Sunday been saved for 20 years every Sunday every time a good Revival come in I'm getting saved again anybody want to be saved yeah me amen Jesus died one time once and for all he was the Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world are you with me now your salvation is not hinged and not based upon what you do or what you can do or what you have done whether it's good or whether it's bad it your salvation is not based on that it's based on what he done for you amen you will never be good enough you'll never to be wory enough right if because of what he done that we can say th are worthy amen that oh Lord I'm glad he's why there he took my place he paid the price are you with me but we struggling the devil will have you to think that you not save next thing you know you dibbling and dabbling and doing stuff you shouldn't do you saying thing you shouldn't say because you don't feel
