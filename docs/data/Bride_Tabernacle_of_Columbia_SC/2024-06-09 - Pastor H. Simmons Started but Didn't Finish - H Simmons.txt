says we started the race we start started out this journey many started but didn't finish like to encourage you to finish what you started amen amen finish what you started amen amen look at somebody and tell them finish finish what you started start amen says here it says for I'm now ready to be offered in the time of my departure is at hand I fought a good fight I have kept I finished my course I've kept the faith henceforth there has laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge should give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearance God bless read toward you may be seated finish what you started started but didn't finish amen was able to complete it let us look at Luke 14 Luke 14 and Peter was was talking in First Peter he concerning our inheritance and he was talking about an inheritance Incorruptible undefiled and fadeth not away amen it's talking about our inheritance our inheritance is Incorruptible amen undefiled and it fadeth not away and he said reserved in heaven for you God has reserved in heaven inheritance for you the children of Israel is on a journey they were coming out of bondage and his slavery and you and I are coming out of barage and slavery to the devil Pharaoh the devil had us Bound by sin and sickness and all kind of unclean spirits ruled over our lives and we're on a journey we the children is just started it took a lot to for the devil to let us go but the devil didn't want to let you go Pharaoh never wanted to let the children of Israel go he did everything he could do to keep him in Egypt amen the devil would do everything he can had some Bound by drugs some Bound by alcohol addiction and some Bound by lust and sex demons some Bound by all kind of unclean ungodly Spirits we all were trapped and Pharaoh had his Whip and he was beating us down some of us just learn to accept a sinful life thought it was living in but it was we were always dying we were always unsatisfied we were always looking for a way of Escape but there was no escap escape from the [Music] Egyptian Egypt was a place that the children of Israel when they wanted to get out the more they cried the more Pharaoh made things difficult harder the more you trying to live a Christian Life or try to get to the your inheritance your Promised Land the place amen that you can rest things get tougher amen things get harder the devil will uh uh put more on you that you can almost bear you can't hardly bear what the devil would put on you when you're trying to get free see it it must be a freedom cry down in your spirit down in your soul I got a freedom cry I got a desire to Amen to go to that promised land to go to that land that flows with milk and honey I got where I can rest amen amen because there's no rest in Egypt I can't be at peace in Egypt because I don't belong here amen amen this is not my promise amen this is what I can't be blessed here because God Amen I'm in bondage I'm I'm not of my homeland amen I need to get back to what God promised me amen amen amen so as we talk about starting but finishing we're talking about your position in Christ your position you got to know your position what God called you why you in the earth why you here God Amen has a purpose amen for you being in the earth amen amen God Made You for a purpose amen and the rest of the world you know you can't imagine what they are all about that's them but you amen God purposed in himself before the foundation of the world Amen had a plan for your life amen and God planed for your life praise God he knew that it was an expected end yes he know what he was looking for at the end Paul says that I fought a good fight are you with me amen I fought a good fight I was kind of preaching on in Mullins but I'm talking to you now I fought a good fight you know sometimes we think that when we get the Holy Ghost all is well and we just sat back and relax and put the plane on automatic and get a land where we it's supposed to land automatic pilot amen just take me to my destination not knowing amen it's going to be some turbulence on that flight praise God and you sometimes have to amen take the wheel and the pilot have to come back and say hey it's some turbulence got to get this thing off automatic and then we got to fly blood these clouds and these storms and all we got to try to escape that or we got to go through it and while we're going through it I got to make sure I'm holding steady amen keeping it from crashing you got to realize though God is you're on the flight you're on your way to heaven and on your way to heaven you started but you must complete your journey you must finish it amen you just can't start some people thank God and that's the way to the children of Israel they got out of Egypt and it crossed the Red Sea and they thought it was so it's we got it made now I'm saying your greatest battle is going to be within Egyptians was gone but they didn't know they themselves had their battles it was you now it wasn't the Egyptian that you was worried about it was them themselves amen amen amen they had to see themselves more than conquerors amen they had to see Victory within themselves but if they could not they were going to be tested they're going to be tried see he says that and Peter says that the trial of your faith is much more precious than gold though it be tried in the fire amen amen are you with me amen your faith that's why Paul says I fought a good fight he said I kept the what I kept the faith amen I I I I hell outen I kept the faith and many of us are on the journey knowing that God has saved us and called us out a and we're in the church and we're on our road to Heaven amen many started out to meon and started out on their road to the promised land we on our road to glory land to Heaven itself they tell me the streets are paved with gold they tell me we won't have to cry no more there'll be no more sickness no more pain no more dying but on our journey we started Paul talks about a crown of righteousness laid up for me amen amen he knew he was going but he said I see what amen all of my label to work here all my fighting I fought a good fight I C the faith amen it's worth it now amen cuz he saw amen he saw the prize amen he saw that I'm crossing the finishing line now amen I had a course amen and you and I have a this life is like a course that we're going through it's a race that we're running amen amen we have a course amen amen he said I finished my course you some of you just starting but you don't know how how long your course is going to be it could be at 25 it could be at 18 it could be at 30 it could be at 15 it could be at 12 your end could come then but your cause everybody don't have the same time limit you might have plans for amen longevity but longevity is not yours to determine job said our steps to num our bounds we cannot pass okay I don't know why I'm standing here must be for a purpose uh excuse me I said Luke 14 and 28 Luke 14 and 28 God is good amen you love him amen it's kind of quied Amen but by the grace of God we're going to keep marching on it says for which of you intended to build a tower and set it not down first first and counted the cause whether they have sufficient to finish it I mean have you considered the cost for Jesus said early if any man uh will come after me if he said If any man come if any man come to me and hated not his father are you with me amen and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sister yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple for whosoever doeth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple the price of discipleship what is going to cost you if you're going to follow him if you're going to start on this journey it's going to cost you something are you willing Amen to consider that it cost the journey has started but am I going to have sufficient am I going to be able to complete what I started to finish what I started I finish my course somebody sometimes people want to stop relax a while I tell you some of us have never ran track or whatever but if you run especially long distances and all if you want to run a mile you got to pace yourself and in pacing yourself you can start off amen kind of slow but as you begin to see the Finishing Line you're going to have to have what they call it some leg to stretch out you're saving it to the end look at somebody and say God saved you to the end you know what that means I I've ran relay races and at the they would put me at the end of the race you usually put the one that's to the fastest at the end I remember running the relay and the guy had already turned the curve when they hand me my pon and I had to pass several people to win the race but I was determined I'm going to win and everybody was standing on the side and they was cuz I was running they without us could not be made what perfect can you see the Saints of old standing there knowing that amen they're waiting on us in order for them to be made perfect they could not be completed without us amen and they standing over in that Dimension said run run run you got to pick it up amen amen somebody said I beat the devil running and I'm so glad amen so in this race oh amen they giving it all they got they trying to beat you and you giving it all you got amen the Demons of Hell amen is giving everything the black Pale Horse Rider riding death and hell is riding amen amen trying to get you amen trying to defeat you but you got to realize amen the anointing that God has given you that eagle anointing that God has given you in this hour that you can Fly Above All these demons that's after you amen amen thank God I'm running amen amen amen I'm running with all my might I amen and just say you got to get desperate praise God you got to know that the token has been applied I got to get in desperation I got to get in a hurry about this amen cuz I see the end now amen oh hallelujah it's something about when you're running and you see the end amen hallelujah praise God all the other all that other uh time it don't mean nothing but when you start seeing that finish praise God you you begin to put I mean you putting it you giving it everything you got to get desperate amen I see the end of this thing praise God I see the end of it amen praise God what if some say hey I ran out of gas you see people they can't give make it why because they didn't Pace itself he said let's lay aside every weight and every sin that doesn't e and let us run with what patience let us run with patience but you know after you run with patience when your patient possess you your soul because I got to run with patient because I want to have sufficient enough to finish it amen I want to be able to finish amen if I run to and don't run with patient amen I'mma run out of gas I'm I'm not going to be able I'm going run out of breath amen I I I won't be a able to finish it amen sometimes in this race uh amen it may look like amen man what what are you doing amen it's a lot of distraction a lot of things they started on the Journey coming out of Egypt but look what happened look what happened on on that Journey uh they started well you did run well who did hind you uh not the Egyptians are you with me you come out your greatest battle that the devil can do more within the church than he can do outside to you amen so the devil realize outside amen if he outside of the church he can't do a lot of damage but if he can ever infiltrate and disguise himself and get in church amen oh Lord let the devil get in the church disguise himself as a Christian goes on under disguise that he he's a Christian he's a Believer just like you transform himself to the age of life amen seem as though amen everything is all right but his purpose is to destroy you am his church purpose is to cause chaos and confusion within the body of Christ amen that's what its purpose is amen praise God not all that came out of Egypt amen praise God had good intentions amen some that came out they came out am me with Moses some came out but you can pretty assume that they had their own uh agenda now the devil amen though he was next to God in heaven Lucifer the Archangel though he was next to God yet he was not satisfied he wasn't satisfied with his position where God how God made him and where God placed him amen you know folks amen when we when we don't understand our position our place in Christ and we don't understand our calling amen and our election and we don't understand our purpose amen then it's almost like chaos anybody can make you anything amen amen when you don't have a a focus and a goal in mind but if you know who you are nobody can take you out of that I was listening to uh one of the preachers and I said goly wo we he was so deep to made my head swim I said man I can't speak like that fell that fell was pulling all kind of why was silence for half an hour and under silence God was making Adam and Eve and stuff like that and I said he said he was why he was resting he wasn't resting like you supposed I said oh yeah he's he's really pulling some stuff I said oh goodness but you know you got to stay in your lane all of that sound pretty and good that's him but you got to recognize amen you don't you don't you're not jealous of other folk and and they can speak like this and speak like that and you get all caught up in that but it's stay in your lane now you might hear somebody that can sing like an angel and you can hardly hold a tune amen but you got to stay in your lane now no no no no don't try to get up that way they are because that's not your voice you might be just uh what you call a little small soprano but they got one of those hot aring [Applause] soprano they going up there and you there you got a false set of whatever you going and you trying to get where they got you they got it naturally that's their gift that God gave them are you with me but you got to be satisfied amen but that's the problem in the in the journey in the race they got amen they got some of those folk want to take Moses out I'm going take Moses out he hey hey hey hey what about the Moses now Moses was in his rightful position God has placed him to carry them to the promised land but yet folk wer satisfied with Moses see infiltration not from without not the Egyptian no more it was within Spirits had infiltrated demons have come in and injected themselves in your thoughts in your mind in your life and next thing you know the whole thing was chaotic they couldn't make it amen to the I mean it could have been just 11 days and they could have made it two million of them took him 40 years to make it are you with me brother and sister I believe God is waiting on us amen let us not do what they did amen praise God let us not do what Luther those did when they come out amen uh uh mystery Bab when they come out of Catholicism amen and they they said that just shall live by faith they was running praise God they was running their course but after a while what the they they took their eyes out it's just like the church even on the day of Pentecost they aimed at God they were running praise God but Paul found out they found lady he said as a wise master builder I have leid the foundation amen the building ain't completed yet amen it's not finished yet I'm I've laid the foundation amen amen you got to be careful how you build on this Foundation amen so Paul really realized I finished my course I I I I you know can you imagine the church Paul you know you had the Old Testament and and the Bible of the Old Testament and they read it and they knew it but here go Paul amen taking the seals off of the Old Testament and all of a sudden he's revealing to them amen all of that was just tipes and just Shadows of things to come I want you to know amen Paul he said behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we should be changed and somebody said well that's what uh joob was talking about I know my redeemer live and Paul was talking about a Rapture amen a place that God has prepared for us amen and the church was getting stirred on fire Paul coming out with the mysteries of the rature he's showing you how the Rapture is going to take place we should be changed in the moment of a twinking of an eye for the trunk shall sound amen and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen and we that alive and remain can you see Hallelujah you say that now look at everybody just said don't excite nobody why because they didn't heard all their life but what happened when Paul went out the scene Paul said after my departure Grievous W going to enter in not sparing the flock amen are you with me amen I'm going I I finished my course but I want you to know amen praise God Amen what's going to happen when I leave here are you with me amen the children of Israel had no idea when they were when they crossed the Red Sea they must have felt they must have felt super duper excited and we going amen we going to that Promised Land but Abraham Isaac and Jacob Joseph amen we got his bones we taking them out we going we going oh Lord have mercy won we long now on this journey and some of us started out all fired up like the early church I'm all fired up hallelujah thank you I don't know how you felt when you got saved somebody say I don't know what you're talking about CU you never got saved if you got saved right some of you I've BN in church I don't know how I feel like I don't know how I feel to get saved all I been look like I've been saved all my life you never had that experience that birth that Born Again experience you never had that fire to come into your life you never had heard the voice of God speak to you and give your heart to Jesus and amen and you really wanted it if any man come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me you never had that to happen to you but when you really had it happen praise God and you saw that your sins were forgiven and you came to calary and you had a real experience that's what the prophet said some folks ain't never had that experience they in the church but they never had they never really got saved though they went through the motions confessing with the mouth believing in the heart but they really it they never sinked in it never became a revelation nothing they didn't really experience amen a real salvation they didn't real really no there really don't know but yet they in the church and going through the motion to recognize as a saint as a member of the body of Christ but yet they never had an experience could you believe after all those Miracles all those signs that those people can get in that Wilderness and cause all that trouble would you believe that that they can mum andain God I ain't got nothing to drink God you ain't got I ain't got nothing to eat and then when you give him something this ain't nothing but some light bread I don't want that give us some flesh to eat we ate flesh over in Egypt give us some meat huh I want this I want that Mama complain see it was the Egyptian who was it then it was them doing all that mumbling girl they W satisfied with nothing you could you satisfy those folk no you couldn't satisfy the church in the wilderness amen that's why it was in the wilderness that God might prove them and see what was in him he saw what was in him didn't he amen didn't did God see what was in him and because of what's in him God said they take this over there they're not going to be representing me are you with me amen because God wanted his people to recognize the true and living God that there's only one God Amen and I have no other God before me God wants you to go to heaven God wants you to walk on the streets of go God want you to enjoy an Incorruptible body God wants you to enjoy amen what it's like amen to not have to cry not have to be in pain not have to have any sorrow God wants you to experience that he said but I want to see what's in you amen amen praise God so I'll let you have a little sorum now have a little pain now I'll let you go through a little something now I going see whether you worthy am amen I'm going see whether you worthy when you get up am amen yes hallelujah amen they proved themselves Unfaithful not ail matter of fact they forgot God and Moses was gone for a while Pastor Moses ain't around Aaron put pressure on Aaron Aaron come out here boy all the people can you see all those people putting pressure on the AR build lots of golden Cal we they took all the gold and their rain and all that huh we going to give you all build us a God that we can worship as for Moses I don't know where he is and Moses done went up in the mountain ain't that right so they got a build a golden Cal and guess what those people did had enough audacity enough ner could you believe that's why some of you folks ain't say it now oh I want to get mad at you because those folk the Bible say after saving them he destroyed them because of unbelief saved them out of Egypt folks setting up in the church he said did God are these the same folk that used to be on drugs used to be an alcoholic used to be a honger are the same people I I want to hear as for Moses you know as for this God that we supposed to be serve it don't got nothing to praise God about all they can see is problems all they can see it oh then they build him a golden C and say what this is our God that bought us out could you believe that if you would have been there Moses if You' have been there in that crowd you would have been putting that pressure on Aon where you have been putting that pressure on feel as a golden C are you with me and he built it and the people had enough now you know good where you should have known better than that amen amen like we know good well folk ought to know what they come to church to do amen they ought to know better had better sense when you in the nightclub you was dancing jumping up and down and all kind of craziness when you come to church I
