[32:35] [Music]
[32:37] the book of philippians 3.
[32:43] thank god for
[32:46] having another chance may not have this
[32:50] chance anymore
[32:53] amen i think they said i have another
[32:55] chance
[32:57] amen philippians 3 and 7
[33:04] it says what things were gained to me
[33:07] those account laws for christ
[33:11] yea doubtless i count all things but
[33:14] lost for the ecstasy
[33:16] of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord
[33:20] for whom i suffer the loss of all things
[33:24] and do count them but done
[33:28] that i may win christ and be found in
[33:32] him
[33:34] not having my own righteousness which is
[33:38] of the law but that which is
[33:41] through the faith of christ
[33:44] the righteousness which is
[33:48] of god by faith that i may know
[33:52] him in the power of his resurrection
[33:56] and in the fellowship of his suffering
[33:58] being made
[33:59] conformable until his death
[34:04] if by any means i might attain
[34:07] until the resurrection of the dead
[34:10] may god bless you read this word you may
[34:12] be seated
[34:17] you know sometimes we look at life and
[34:19] all the things that we have to
[34:21] lose in order to gain christ
[34:26] paul had achieved many great things
[34:30] and probably you know sometimes if we
[34:32] work hard to achieve
[34:36] a certain status and
[34:39] certain academic goals and certain life
[34:42] goals
[34:44] sometimes when it comes down to christ
[34:47] people make decisions
[34:50] sometimes people have attained great
[34:53] riches and
[34:54] they've done many things
[34:58] sometimes folks don't even have nothing
[35:00] but the ideal
[35:02] a thought a concept
[35:07] yet they don't want to lose that which
[35:09] they have
[35:12] for christ but in coming to christ there
[35:16] must
[35:17] you must be willing to lose in order to
[35:19] gain
[35:22] paul realized that he had to come to
[35:24] that fact on the road to the masters
[35:27] he had to come to the reality that what
[35:30] he had he had to give up
[35:34] yes he was very religious and very
[35:36] resilient for the god and yet
[35:38] he had been schooled and trained well
[35:42] sometimes our denominational ideas
[35:46] going to seminary school and learning
[35:48] how to be a good
[35:50] baptist a method it's a a pentecostal or
[35:54] some persuasion even when it comes down
[35:57] to message believers
[36:00] sometimes all we have is theories and
[36:02] concepts
[36:06] sometimes we don't know the person of
[36:08] jesus christ
[36:10] sometimes we were we were reared up in a
[36:13] certain persuasion and because we were
[36:16] raised a certain way we seem to accept
[36:19] that this is the way
[36:22] this is the truth and this is the life
[36:26] but many times we have to come to the
[36:28] place of reality
[36:30] the many things that we think that we
[36:32] have and we're holding on to
[36:34] we have to give it up
[36:37] in order to win christ
[36:41] to lose is the gain let us look at the
[36:45] book of ruth
[36:53] and we know the story a little bit uh
[36:59] roof had went out i mean naomi had went
[37:02] out with her husband
[37:06] and she had lost her two sons and all
[37:09] she
[37:09] had left was her two daughter-in-laws
[37:13] orpha and ruth
[37:19] and she was in such a condition that
[37:23] they had left bethlehem or judea to
[37:27] journey over
[37:31] until
[37:35] the land
[37:41] and after journeying from bethlehem and
[37:44] judah
[37:45] judea marlon and colin died
[37:50] eliminate her husband had died
[37:55] and she realized she'd come to a place
[37:58] that i have no reason to stay over
[38:03] in this foreign land i need to go back
[38:06] home
[38:10] so she went out full and she said she's
[38:13] returning home empty
[38:18] she tried to persuade her
[38:19] daughter-in-law's moab
[38:21] why don't y'all stay over here and serve
[38:23] your gods
[38:26] because i don't have a son or whatever
[38:29] to give you
[38:32] and uh just
[38:36] stay and get your husband and you know
[38:39] you have a life
[38:42] sometimes we make decisions because of
[38:44] circumstances and sometimes all
[38:45] decisions that we make
[38:48] will determine our eternal destiny
[38:52] see this one uh
[38:55] roof here was not just thinking about
[38:58] herself
[38:59] and her life she had something far more
[39:02] that she was
[39:02] envisioned and she was looking at
[39:05] brother and sister i think we look at
[39:07] the moment
[39:08] now and what we're achieving and what
[39:10] we've gotten we
[39:12] spent our time debating and getting all
[39:15] been out of proportion and uh uh
[39:18] sometimes we're not settled down
[39:19] we're not really what we ought to be as
[39:23] christians because we are so tangled up
[39:28] and so mixed up
[39:29] in the worldly affairs
[39:34] amen we cannot get entangled
[39:37] with the world amen we must
[39:40] be willing to give the world up
[39:44] amen because the world amen will have
[39:46] you in bondage
[39:50] but we must be able to forsake the world
[39:54] brother and sister
[39:58] his roof replied when her mother-in-law
[40:01] uh said i i want you to go back and get
[40:04] married or whatever
[40:06] paraphrasing going on you know with your
[40:09] people and
[40:10] serve your gods she said
[40:15] in the 16th verse ruth said
[40:19] and treat me not to leave thee

[54:00] in the midst of all the adversities
[54:04] she held on to god's unchanging hand
[54:08] losing the game let me just reflect
[54:12] again
[54:12] at hebrews 12 here because i like to
[54:15] read it
[54:16] and just remind us again why again
[54:19] why again because
[54:23] the decision that people make
[54:26] sometimes cause you to reflect back
[54:29] and to re-evaluate when you're praying
[54:32] through
[54:33] and you know i i was
[54:36] looking at investment and and what the
[54:39] prophet was saying about investment and
[54:41] i was really realizing that
[54:45] people invest in he said make sure it's
[54:48] something that's solid that you invest
[54:50] in
[54:51] not a fly-by-day company make sure it's
[54:54] established
[54:55] company if you're going to invest in it
[54:58] some people will put their
[54:59] whole life saving in some fly by night
[55:02] something that
[55:03] just come up and then put all their life
[55:05] saving
[55:06] into invest in some quick rich
[55:10] scheme and they find out they lost
[55:13] everything amen he said but don't follow
[55:16] out that
[55:17] he said go and do your research
[55:20] and see whether or not this company is
[55:22] stable and see
[55:23] how long it's been standing and when you
[55:26] make an investment amen
[55:28] amen you got to seek out that you're
[55:30] making a good investment
[55:32] and we weren't in this life here
[55:35] we make certain choices choice uh
[55:38] he meant to go to school or not to go to
[55:40] school
[55:41] the the choice to get a trade a trusted
[55:45] live in a certain neighborhood to live
[55:46] in a certain standard
[55:48] we invest in certain things but the
[55:51] decision that we make
[55:52] amen the gain that we're getting out of
[55:55] certain situations we got to know
[55:57] amen is this the will of god for our
[55:59] lives
[56:01] this is the will of god for my family
[56:03] it's just the will of god
[56:04] sometimes we can uh make the wrong
[56:07] decisions because
[56:08] amen we we're investing we have we got
[56:12] to count the cause
[56:14] are you with me so the prophet god said
[56:16] make me
[56:17] make good investments amen that you can
[56:19] get dividend in amen
[56:21] that you got something that's standing
[56:23] amen
[56:26] so by the grace of god he said not many
[56:28] of those get
[56:30] rich quick schemes he said many of them
[56:33] really work are you with me
[56:37] so here moses
[56:41] you know you've seen those preachers
[56:43] that are excited and work you all
[56:45] up and dust set the lord this is going
[56:47] to happen not going to happen
[56:49] like all of them did uh president trump
[56:51] and trump is going to be president
[56:53] again all those prophets it's almost
[56:57] like hannah nyaya makaya said
[57:00] if he is then i the lord didn't speak to
[57:02] me
[57:05] are you a man but all of them you know
[57:08] the youtube preachers prophets yeah yeah

[58:02] people that try to be spiritual
[58:05] anytime a person being super spiritual

[59:28] i'm a hold on to this to taking me in
[59:30] the hole sometimes we hold on to things
[59:33] that's keeping us bound up and
[59:35] taking us down we hold on to something
[59:38] somebody said that somebody said that
[59:40] somebody said
[59:45] oh i can't trust this person because i
[59:48] know it right because they said it and i
[59:50] know the lord with this person
[59:53] let it go

[1:00:16] good to hold the grudge and
[1:00:19] hold something oh that nothing is the
[1:00:21] devil oh is the devil oh lord
[1:00:25] sometimes you got to say to the devil i
[1:00:28] forgive you
[1:00:29] then the bible says judas friend
[1:00:32] betrayed me
[1:00:33] with a kiss and then the bible said
[1:00:36] satan haven't entered into judah says
[1:00:38] carrier simon's son
[1:00:41] isn't that right so he it actually
[1:00:44] wasn't a demon in him with the devil in
[1:00:46] him but
[1:00:46] jesus was saying friend
[1:00:50] see jesus was able to forgive his
[1:00:52] archenemy
[1:00:55] are you with me and yet we ain't able to
[1:00:58] forgive
[1:00:59] somebody that we thought
[1:01:04] that we thought say something about us
[1:01:06] lord heaven
[1:01:07] i said god i wish the people would grow
[1:01:11] up and get some
[1:01:12] real spiritual fortitude
[1:01:16] and real christian character
[1:01:19] amen if people don't soon grow up
[1:01:21] they'll lose their
[1:01:22] soul trying to be spiritual
[1:01:29] sometimes we get too spiritual and
[1:01:32] and lose god but we know we ought to be
[1:01:36] able to lose ourselves
[1:01:39] that we might gain christ the love of
[1:01:41] god
[1:01:43] amen in this age we must come to the
[1:01:45] headstone
[1:01:47] amen we got to come to the top of the
[1:01:49] pyramid we

[1:03:03] contagious
[1:03:06] love is stronger even than death are you
[1:03:09] with me
[1:03:10] brother and sister don't let nothing
[1:03:12] cause you
[1:03:13] to have a little funny feeling about one
[1:03:16] another
[1:03:17] love one another in spite get rid of the
[1:03:20] find a feeling get out of here what are
[1:03:21] you doing then
[1:03:23] you don't belong here amen the prophet
[1:03:25] of god says
[1:03:27] christ the mystery of god reveal the
[1:03:29] word to the church
[1:03:30] when he was talking about pausing in the
[1:03:32] church he said
[1:03:33] the satan if there's nobody in here like
[1:03:37] that
[1:03:37] he says satan will send somebody in and
[1:03:39] shoot some poison in them
[1:03:42] and have a little funny feeling he'll
[1:03:43] spread that thing throughout the whole
[1:03:45] church
[1:03:46] he said that what the devil would do
[1:03:48] isn't that right and that's what i
[1:03:50] pausing in the church paul's in the
[1:03:53] get everybody mind on something that
[1:03:56] ain't even true
[1:03:57] but satan will inject that and shoot
[1:03:59] that pause and and spread it all over
[1:04:01] everybody amen because if it was right
[1:04:05] and it was from the law you'll go and
[1:04:08] get that situation strained out
[1:04:10] isn't that right you'll go straight to
[1:04:13] that brother that sister and get it
[1:04:14] straightened out in there
[1:04:16] but that's the way the law works not
[1:04:18] spread pausing throughout the church
[1:04:19] isn't that right
[1:04:21] telling everybody but the person that
[1:04:24] are you with me so brothers and sisters
[1:04:28] watch it watch it word to the church
[1:04:31] go back and look at it
[1:04:34] let's let's look at
[1:04:38] um 23 11 and 23.
[1:04:44] yo y'all feel all right this morning
[1:04:47] this ain't preaching just talking to you
[1:04:49] a little bit
[1:04:50] god is good isn't that right
[1:04:54] he said by faith when he was born
[1:04:57] he was heared three months of his
[1:05:00] parents
[1:05:01] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:05:05] and they were not afraid of the king's
[1:05:08] commandments
[1:05:09] by faith moses when he was coming years
[1:05:12] refused to be called
[1:05:14] the son of pharaoh's daughter
[1:05:17] i'm going to tell you something moses
[1:05:21] got in a place where he had all the game
[1:05:28] but he refused it brothers and sisters
[1:05:31] sometimes
[1:05:32] what looks like a blessing could be a
[1:05:34] curse
[1:05:37] that's why i said moses had something
[1:05:39] inside of him
[1:05:41] to make the decision that he made you
[1:05:44] know it took
[1:05:45] god for most most of us all the love
[1:05:48] don't
[1:05:49] let me hear you no
[1:05:53] hallelujah i know god is good
[1:05:57] brothers and sisters sometimes some
[1:05:59] blessings didn't come from god
[1:06:03] and then god can use even your enemy
[1:06:07] to bless you for a season only to the
[1:06:10] time that he's appointed
[1:06:13] and i believe it came a time that god
[1:06:16] had appointed time to open moses eyes
[1:06:19] and let him see and moses had to make a
[1:06:22] decision from that time
[1:06:25] from that time are you with me
[1:06:28] you and i get to a place where god put
[1:06:31] us in
[1:06:32] a place where we have to make decisions
[1:06:35] okay he says choosing rather to suffer
[1:06:39] the affliction with the people of god
[1:06:42] can you see i'll step out the king
[1:06:45] palace and i'll go with these slaves
[1:06:48] these people that's in
[1:06:49] barnes these mud dobblers
[1:06:53] i'm gonna go down until the people of
[1:06:55] lois state
[1:06:56] some of us amen suppose we uh we were
[1:06:59] you know multi-millionaires and we going
[1:07:01] to the ghetto
[1:07:06] and you're going to be identified with
[1:07:07] those that are in the ghetto that can't
[1:07:09] hardly pay them rent
[1:07:12] are you with me i'm gonna leave
[1:07:16] my sometimes god has to bring us down
[1:07:19] and he have to
[1:07:20] tell us to give it up always like the
[1:07:22] young rich ruler he may
[1:07:24] you know he he he had god said
[1:07:27] you know good master what my side dude
[1:07:29] he heard eternal life he said sell
[1:07:31] everything you have
[1:07:35] because brothers and sisters sometimes
[1:07:37] god asks us to make decisions that we
[1:07:40] don't really want to obey
[1:07:45] but in order to gain eternal life he had
[1:07:48] to sell all that he has
[1:07:51] but he wasn't willing to make that
[1:07:55] brother sacrifice sister some sacrifices
[1:07:57] we must be willing to make
[1:07:59] you know if i make this decision abraham
[1:08:02] if i made the decision that means where
[1:08:04] i was real and all this that i've gained
[1:08:06] over in
[1:08:07] china the canadians but i got to leave
[1:08:10] and go to some place you ain't telling
[1:08:12] me where i'm going
[1:08:13] but you say to come and abraham come out
[1:08:18] he called abraham out from his kinfolk
[1:08:20] out from his country
[1:08:22] and going somewhere i don't even know
[1:08:24] where i'm going but like god
[1:08:26] spoke see it got to be gone brother and
[1:08:29] sister god don't have to explain to you
[1:08:32] he meant when he saved you and he called
[1:08:34] you he
[1:08:35] amen to call you by his grace he don't
[1:08:37] have to explain to you
[1:08:39] amen all he said come on and follow me
[1:08:44] amen the disciples saying to jesus
[1:08:46] master where you're going
[1:08:47] he said i'm going to tell you where i'm
[1:08:49] going have holes
[1:08:51] birds of the air have nests but the son
[1:08:53] of man don't have nowhere to lay his
[1:08:55] head
[1:08:56] come on you still want to go come on
[1:09:00] follow me brother and sister i'm telling
[1:09:03] you god asks you
[1:09:04] to make decisions not for the advantages
[1:09:08] of things that you see
[1:09:09] but god has an eternal plan for your
[1:09:12] life
[1:09:13] and an eternal destination
[1:09:16] are you with me praise god you got to
[1:09:19] know it's god
[1:09:21] you got to know it's god speaking to
[1:09:23] your heart and god's speaking to your
[1:09:25] situation and god that knows all about
[1:09:28] amen all you've been through all you're
[1:09:29] going through god knows that oh
[1:09:33] oh the lord will show you everything but
[1:09:35] the right thing
[1:09:37] amen the devil will hold you all bind up
[1:09:41] and amen all twitch it up amen the devil
[1:09:44] won't let you
[1:09:45] love like you ought to love
[1:09:48] amen the devil won't give you peace
[1:09:51] he have you always confusing not knowing
[1:09:54] how to make a sound decision
[1:09:59] god is not the author of so i said well
[1:10:02] i'm confused i don't know what to do
[1:10:05] god and not the authors get it come from
[1:10:07] god
[1:10:11] are you a man when god speaks to you
[1:10:14] amen it might hurt you but it's gonna be
[1:10:18] the truth
[1:10:19] amen it might not be what you want but
[1:10:21] it's what god want
[1:10:24] are you with me so he says
[1:10:28] choosing rather to suffer the affliction
[1:10:30] with the people of god
[1:10:31] then enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:10:33] season
[1:10:34] let me tell you something some people
[1:10:37] make the wrong decision
[1:10:41] some people think i can put god on the
[1:10:44] back burner
[1:10:47] and i tell god to wait till i'm ready
[1:10:52] god when i get ready to serve you i'll
[1:10:54] let you know
[1:10:56] woo
[1:10:59] the prophet god said if there is a
[1:11:02] desire
[1:11:03] in you for god
[1:11:07] and you know that there's a hunger and
[1:11:09] there's a desire
[1:11:10] in you to serve him
[1:11:14] he said you need to take advantage of
[1:11:16] that desire
[1:11:18] because one day you'll wake up and that
[1:11:20] desire won't be there
[1:11:22] anymore are you with me
[1:11:26] if you have a desire to serve
[1:11:29] the lord and to live for the lord then
[1:11:32] god has given you that desire
[1:11:36] but what happens if you do not take
[1:11:39] advantage
[1:11:40] of that desire he said god will take
[1:11:43] that desire
[1:11:44] away from you
[1:11:50] don't let god take that desire away from
[1:11:52] you
[1:11:53] if you ever deserve that that's god to
[1:11:56] put that desire in you to serve him
[1:11:59] and you have that desire to serve him
[1:12:01] take advantage of that desire
[1:12:04] lord i serve you lord i want to serve
[1:12:07] you lord i do
[1:12:08] oh okay
[1:12:11] many people don't even have a desire to
[1:12:13] serve the lord
[1:12:14] hey do you want to ah not ain't no no
[1:12:18] desire
[1:12:19] but if you have that desire take
[1:12:22] advantage of that desire
[1:12:25] are you with me he says
[1:12:30] esteeming the reproach of christ
[1:12:33] the pledge of the sin foresees
[1:12:36] sometimes you have tears in your eyes
[1:12:39] crying for your loved ones
[1:12:43] that makes their own choice
[1:12:46] and you cry with tears in your eyes
[1:12:50] because they you know they're making the
[1:12:52] wrong choice
[1:12:55] and you know that that their choice
[1:12:58] they take them down some dog roads
[1:13:03] and some perilous and dangerous times in
[1:13:07] their life
[1:13:09] and you're crying why
[1:13:14] because you don't want to see them go
[1:13:17] through what they got to go through
[1:13:21] for the decision that they made
[1:13:24] oh lord if there's a desire
[1:13:28] somewhere in our hearts
[1:13:32] if you're listening not there if that's
[1:13:34] the desire to serve the lord
[1:13:38] amen one day god might take that desire
[1:13:42] away
[1:13:44] you that are here that amen desiring
[1:13:47] amen to serve the lord but yet you're
[1:13:50] not going all the way
[1:13:51] you know you're holding back on god i'd
[1:13:54] say
[1:13:55] amen fulfill the desire
[1:14:00] there's something god wants you to do
[1:14:02] amen that god has a purpose and a plan
[1:14:04] for your life
[1:14:05] but you're holding back on god because
[1:14:08] god can
[1:14:09] no he can move that away from you
[1:14:14] what is the preach what is the saying
[1:14:17] what is the plan
[1:14:18] instrument whatever desire god has put
[1:14:21] in your heart
[1:14:22] i want you to know that one day god can
[1:14:24] move it
[1:14:31] but probably god said that it just just
[1:14:34] anchored down inside of me
[1:14:37] because i desire to do a lot of things
[1:14:40] amen and i said lord please don't take
[1:14:43] those desires away
[1:14:45] it's things and people that i want to
[1:14:47] reach people that i want to share this
[1:14:49] message with things that i want to do as
[1:14:52] the lord don't take that desire away
[1:14:54] from me
[1:14:55] let me fulfill that let me just go to
[1:14:58] those individuals
[1:14:59] let me tell them about this more perfect
[1:15:02] way
[1:15:06] god planned for us
[1:15:12] see he said esteeming the
[1:15:16] reproach of christ greater what
[1:15:20] greater riches than he said greatest
[1:15:23] riches
[1:15:24] where your tragedy is that will your
[1:15:26] heart be also you know right
[1:15:28] praise god i'd rather lose all my
[1:15:30] worldly treasures
[1:15:33] amen and to do something for the lord
[1:15:35] brother
[1:15:37] put god first to do something for jesus
[1:15:40] first
[1:15:41] amen praise god i know you said i got to
[1:15:44] work tell you about my family
[1:15:45] let me do something for god do something
[1:15:47] that yo
[1:15:49] if i can do something for the law
[1:15:52] because everything that i gained in this
[1:15:54] life is going
[1:16:00] i lose it amen
[1:16:04] but i'll lose i'd rather lose everything
[1:16:06] and gain christ
[1:16:10] greater riches see how rich
[1:16:13] just think how rich pharaoh was
[1:16:17] and all the riches
[1:16:20] the riches of the billionaires of this
[1:16:22] earth
[1:16:25] it was no comparison to
[1:16:28] the riches that pharaoh had pharaoh the
[1:16:34] richest
[1:16:35] man in the whole world and
[1:16:38] just just think the kind of style
[1:16:42] the way it could set and some folks are
[1:16:45] for a few million dollars
[1:16:49] give up on god some folk for a few
[1:16:52] thousand dollars would give god up
[1:16:57] but look what moses pursued
[1:17:02] esteem in the reproach he knew he had to
[1:17:04] go through something
[1:17:05] the bible said the reproach of christ
[1:17:07] was moses back then christ
[1:17:09] stayed in jesus christ but jesus said i
[1:17:12] am that i am
[1:17:14] the reproach of christ you know you got
[1:17:16] to go through something brothers and
[1:17:17] sisters you got to lose something
[1:17:21] the thing is when we reproach for the
[1:17:24] name of jesus

[1:17:28] concerning the fiery trials which are
[1:17:30] the trials
