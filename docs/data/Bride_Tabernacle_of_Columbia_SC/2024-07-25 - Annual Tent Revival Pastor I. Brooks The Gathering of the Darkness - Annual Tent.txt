I believe it's a great blessing to be gathered here amen and I believe the purpose is to Worship the Lord amen amen because from the Garden of Eden God wanted to be worshiped sir and today we are here just to worship Him amen amen so I just want to read one scripture just as a greeting amen amen amen uh I want to read from John chapter 4 [Music] uh maybe let me read from verse [Music] 19 uh the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet yes our fathers worshiped in this mountain and he said that in Jerusalem is the place where men or to worship Jesus says unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when he shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what yeah we know what we worship yeah for salvation is of the Jews yes sir but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers oh yeah shall worship the father in the spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him am God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen amen so I believe we are here to worship him in the spirit and in truth am you know the the Bible says God is seeking for such worshippers am amen if he's seeking for them then it means they are very few come on now they are not there he's just seeking for them so you can't see for something which is there you seek for something which is not there but we thank God that God has found us amen so we have to worship God in the spirit and in the truth so meaning that there are many people who even don't know whom to worship yeah yeah they they can go to church yeah yes come on Amen they can worship they can sing come on but they don't know whom they worship yeah but that's what Jesus was telling that woman yes sir you don't know whom to worship sir amen but I want to thank God that there are people who have known whom to worship amen because God is a spirit and they that worship Him must it is a must amen not maybe but it's a must to worship him in the spirit and in the truth amen and you know today if you ask somebody whom do you worship he just says I worship God I worship God yes but with God they don't know the god they worshiping amen but the Bible says in the beginning there was word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen so we find out that we are worshiping the word is that right is that right so when you are right in the word then you know whom to worship am amen amen in the beginning there was a word and the word was with God and the Word was God Amen so some people say I believe in God I believe in God but if you give them the word they deny the word now whom do they worship wow so we have to come back to the word for us to know whom to worship we must come back to the word the word amen and we thank God for the reveal word in due season amen brings us to know whom to worship amen I believe it's in the book of uh First Kings I believe there were also [Music] worshippers amen but there is one who knew whom to worship and That Was Elijah amen amen yes and they really worshiped and they danced they sang They praised they did everything but they didn't know whom to worship that's good is that right then Elijah says now God come come come here and I show you whom to worship is that right and the Bible says when they sang when they praise and they worshiped they kicked the stones it took Elijah to gather the stones on now and put them together in their places and I believe those stones type the scriptures is that right yes sir yeah so he had to bring the scriptures each scripture to its place yes sir he repaired the altar amen then after repairing the altar he said now Lord I have done it according to thy according to thy according to Thy word amen now Let the Fire Fall hallelujah hallelujah he did it according to the word of the Lord and the fire fell amen and today when he want the fire to fall we must do it according to his [Applause] word amen hallelujah then the healing came in the Miracles the Wonders amen and today we are worshiping that God Amen and I believe when you was him amen the healing is going to take place yes whoever came sick here will go back here because he's a miracle working godallah he's a God who answers prayers amen hallelujah amen if you know the God you are worshiping you will not go back the same you will go back delivered you'll go back changed you'll go back with a miracle amen because he's a living God amen hallelujah hallelujah I believe that's the God you have come to worship God bless [Music] you thank you Lord

Henry Simmons who makes it possible for these meetings to go on yes sir and if you've ever put on a little meeting I call mine little good to see you sister that's a lot of work and I trust by the grace of God that the end of the day when it's all over we'll be able to see all the souls that were encouraged those that were one uh in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ cuz this is what it's all about and I'm so happy about it while you're standing ing uh let us uh turn to Genesis some of these brothers can really sing it just put me down to a place where I just like to sing a hym I ain't calling no names but I just love the way they sing I'm telling you oh my God is so good to us Hollywood has nothing on us cuz when a person can sing and you can feel it oh that means the world of me what comes from the heart touches the heart amen God bless you [Laughter] brother amen Genesis he you're another Warrior just Warriors in this place Genesis 1 I I trust that the message will be a blessing to you tonight I I don't know about you but um things have changed especially for me I see things like I've never seen before sir and uh I guess I have the greatest peace I've ever had right now because I realize what he has done for me and I'm so appreciative of the grace of godall Genesis 1 14-9 [Music] we have lived this message and many of who started out is gone I'm so glad I'm still Yes Genesis 14 I'm Excuse Me Genesis 1:14 through 19 and God said let there be light in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of Heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so uhhuh and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day the Lesser light to rule the night he made the stars all also and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth I love that yeah and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from darkness and God saw that it was good you love the Lord Genesis 126 27 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth yeah so God created man in his own image in the image of God created him male and female created he them uhuh and don't you forget it God is so good to us one more scripture if you don't mind I'll be coming from job 20 38 we'll be reading the Third third verse 3-7 gerle up thy loins like a man I like it when God says that sir for I will demand of thee answer thou me it it's [Music] amazing how God speaks to a man yeah come on now and we know that the only way job could answer that is that God would give him the answer yeah right where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth declare if thou H has understanding yeah who have laid the measures thereof if thou knowth or who have scattered the lines upon it where on are the foundations thereof fashioned or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy amen let us pray our gracious father God we come before you Lord as as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace and without you lord we're nothing tonight there's nothing we can do of ourselves and father I'm totally dependent upon you tonight to take complete control of this vessel to your glory speak to our hearts and our minds father we didn't come here for ENT amen but we came to be changed from glory to glory and you're the only one that can bring this change so help us Lord because we are a needy people and we need you the only LIF giving source so bless your people tonight look beyond our thoughts and see our needs and we'll be careful to give you the praise Hallelujah the glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated I was looking uh for brother ivonne's wife I didn't see her back there now do now that everybody sat down God bless you Sister God is so good to us amen I don't know about you but I'm going say all that I need to say you know until you recognize that you're free you will always be bound all right by some system come on come on and I found out that in all my years in the message see we left a system but we have come to a place now in time where we see that many of the people I won't say all right right even in this message yes come on have built a system hello many people have fallen because they married to a system right yes sir instead of Christ himself one thing I know about the word of God yes it comes to identify you I read there in Genesis because many of us know that in Genesis the the the the the Earth was void and without shape yes come on and even though there were things laying beneath that voidness am there was no identification and as the Pastor said amen it took the word yes the spoken word to bring forth light to separate the darkness am amen yes sir from the light it took God to move back everything that was hindering the manifestation of the seeds that were buried y'all already hear what I'm saying we have a a a time now where God has given us the opportunity yeah to make our Christianity real all right all right understand me like the brother said many people don't know what they're worshiping is that right because God is light amen right and in a day like this day men still struggle with identity come on they don't know who they are what they are where they came from and where they going right that's right that is the god of Darkness come on come on somebody we must understand that we living it all over again uhhuh goad where the world is void the world can't give you nothing The World Is void people are void because without God you're void you're empty Hallelujah and God is the only one who can [Applause] satisfy my subject tonight is the Gathering of the [Applause] darkness we're living in a time where people are afraid fear true and if you still if you are a Christian and you afraid to die I to go through some trial something vital is missing in your life all right all right all right one thing you must understand God works by his own timing that's right Hallelujah and God is even Bound by his own word is that right for an example when Jesus died he couldn't just get up ameno he was bound by his own word yes amen amen the Bible says as Jonah was in the belly of the wh for three days and three nights he couldn't come up on the first day he couldn't come up on the second day that's good he had to come up at that appointed time that's good is that right and you got to realize the Bible says that when Jesus died the graves were open come on somebody that means there was an Avenue where those who were dead in God could come out yes sir but they could not come out come on until Jesus came out because he was the first fruit he had to be the first to come out and to manifest himself yes sir but why are you saying all these things because Christians don't know how to wait on God they don't know how to wait for God and let me say it like this nothing happens to a Christian without God knowing about [Applause] [Music] it we are in a position we're about to experience something like Enoch experienced amen we're getting ready for the change of the body but many people think because they're religious God don't caree sir God is not looking for religion he came for his children he asked the question to job and I'm asking it to you where were you when the morning Stars sang can I ask you a question brother who is the morning Stars oh we rejoice as if we're speaking of someone else come on now but these were representations yeah in the mind of God of you and me but what were you shouting about what was the Joy about hallelujah hallelujah job had gone through so many trials oh yeah man but you know what he had God had to break him right cuz sometimes people get so religious they think they got it all in the bag I've done this I've done that I've kept all but even your sacrifices doesn't declare that you know who you sacrificing [Applause] to sir and God wanted job to see who was behind him all right God wanted job to see who was blessing him it wasn't job's ility to be rich God ordained him y'all understand what I'm trying to say what I'm saying is is that when you think that you're somebody you're nobody all right many people think that the heavens were placed in their position just to determine Four Seasons you know how people do I'm going through my winter a season you see but it was also placed there for the Times all right yes and I thought about this thing when when God created everything on the sixth day and he rested on the seventh and I'm like what is he resting for because he had already finished there was nothing left to do oh I'm getting happy now because you got to realize salvation is of the Lord and this thing was done before you got here is that all right so you say what you trying to say listen let me tell you like this uh Heaven as the Bible says and Earth declare of his glory and I thought what are they talking about what is what is psalmist saying Heaven and Earth declare his glory because amen we know that the prophet of God said this the first Bible was written in heaven right we know that these zodiac things are all screwed up now but there was a time that you could read it those who were ordained to cuz everybody couldn't do it but there was a specific Man by the name of Daniel who Al who knew what all of those things meant that's right the Bible declared he was a wisest of all men listen he it was Daniel's teachings that produced what we call the wise men Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying come on think about this yes out of all the wise people muh that was up Babylon uhuh these three uhuh come on was elected by God so Daniel had to be in Babylon come on yes sir in order to bring the word come on you see what I'm saying yes sir because you must realize without the word or the revelation of the word that's you are in darkness right is that right Psalms 119 105 says the word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my pathway oh come on somebody in that day they didn't have lights like this they had a torch that they call a lamp is that right so their light was only arm length Hallelujah they couldn't see what was in the F what was in the future the darkness that was in the future y'all know what I'm trying to say their sight and their Vision was [Applause] limited Hallelujah but we had a light to [Applause] come in our day didn't it was not limited in this light it told us where we came from and where we're going Hallelujah when you are a real Christian and you understand yes sir Hallelujah without this light you would be in darkness yes sir Hallelujah you know even job understood he couldn't do nothing with what God was doing with him no doubt in his suffering he wanted it to stop huh come on somebody none of us love to suffer on right but one thing joob concluded I'm going to wait to my change come y'all hear what I'm saying I don't know about about you but I'm raptured material hallelujah how do you know because the light has come that's right God oh Amen brother we see in the Book of Revelation Jesus Christ have Seven Stars come on in his right hand but you see those Seven Stars rep represented light amen is that right amen and each one of those lights we we we know what we're talking about here each one of those light had a time period right to show up on Earth that's right exactly right and every time a light came whether it was Luther come on whether it was Wesley come on the church was in darkness y'all hear what I'm saying see he he had to bring it this way so we'll know which way to walk come on Hallelujah we'll know the direction to

than just a Healer yeah there is a relationship that God came to establish with this last day bride oh come on somebody and without that relationship you will be left behind so preacher Don't Preach it like that I got to preacher because the hour is late and many of us think because I could worship come on I'm like Lord don't let him go too far on oh but don't you understand everybody's

that she could have a massive heart attack at any time but she says no I want I'm asking God to heal me amen hallelujah but we had a fine Brimstone meeting I wasn't even the preacher but God came down that H that sister husband was really nervous crying at times because he was afraid that God was going to take his wife God's own timing oh yeah the Devil is a bluff come on somebody do you think that job never thought he was going to die but that wasn't in God plan oh come on somebody Hallelujah she called me all excited cuz she works at the hospital she said I did another EKG everything's gone everything's clear I feel so much better you see you see how some of y'all responding the old Pentecostals y'all had to shut him down y'all understand me they gave praise with everything but you've been [Applause] systemized you've been systemized you you figed it's not it's not um koser right it's not cool oh come on somebody you got see that's why God still got to do something for you you and

your Tempo the Holy Ghost binds you you love the Lord God is good to usall we we must understand by the grace of God Amen that we come to do the will of God amen amen and we come and God is our helper is that right Amos 3:7 says surely the Lord will do nothing yes sir but he Reveals His Secrets unto his servants the prophets right the lion have roared who will not fear the lord God has spoken yeah and who have who can but prophesy but understand God's timing Hallelujah is that right Malachi fall couldn't come in Luther's time he couldn't come in West time he had to come at the what end time and that means end e n d so how much time we have left Hallelujah I'm not getting ready I'm going somewhere else I want you to understand the brother said you got to Praise Jesus come on come on oh y'all act don't know but without the Lord Jesus none of us would be here right come on we say all those Apostles they were great men of God the only reason why they were great men of God because on the day of Pentecost those licks of fire Hallelujah dwelt in them the only way you ever be anything in God you got to have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I'm not talking about in your mind I'm talking about in your soul yes sir a lot of us a lot of us still got it in our minds that's why when Trials come you always drop in your head come on Hallelujah come on somebody I don't mean you got to rejoice in time of trouble but know one thing your troubles should never take away your praise somebody help me when I'm going through something I've got to know what I'm looking at Hallelujah I got to know that Jesus Christ is on the scene come on somebody is that right that's what God told the prophet if you get the people to believe all things are possible Hallelujah but let me say like this how many of you really believe come on somebody believe is not in your head it must be in your heart hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said no weapon formed against me shall prosper do you believe this [Applause] Hallelujah though the darkness come I'm not afraid of the darkness come on now why you say that because from the beginning sir light has always conquered Darkness Darkness has never conquered the

tonight Hallelujah never let your trials get the best of you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hey is that right the prophet of God said they prayed all night and didn't get an answer y'all know what I mean they didn't feel it no Goosebumps was on their flesh they didn't feel a win Hallelujah but they had a promise Hallelujah they had a word and the most important thing they knew they knew who they were see what I'm saying you you are defeated when you don't know who you are yes sir you got to know it the squeeze coming in you worried about whether you bride or not you can't make yourself bride he made you Pride Hallelujah that's his election not yours that's his choice not yours so I'm going to rejoice in his choosing Hallelujah you got to rejoice in his choosing look at the world the world is falling apart come on somebody not only the political realm earthquakes famin hot you know what I'm saying everything is out of its place but while the world is falling apart the Bride of Jesus Christ is marching to the old Christian Soldier marching as you are with the cross of Jesus look around look at the world is falling apart Hallelujah the world all is but not the world of the Bride

group of folks that's guilty tonight H but we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we've got to live above the church come on somebody I'll say it again we are the bride of Christ we must live above the

you're not you're not a Brooks you're not you you're not related to that man who claimed to be yours oh yes come on you know y'all don't understand because when I was coming up I didn't want to look like my daddy come on Revelation I wish I had a better Revelation then but that was due to because I didn't like him no that's not true I loved him but he didn't like me all right all right you understand me yes sir so every time somebody say ohoo you look like your daddy you know how people say they say oh you look like a clone those were not compliments but say that to me about Jesus yeah

Adam controlling it all over [Applause] again y'all hear what I'm saying that wasn't put on display for you to be oh and ooh and wo that's for you you don't get there easily you got to suffer not only that you got to be obedient yes sir yes sir yes sir yes sir I'm way off track but I've got to say it the way he's come bringing it to me what do you see when you look at the word we read it like we reading a novel a but you'll never understand it until you step into it amen that word must become you it's the truth then you'll realize there's no giant that cannot be slain on now cuz back then you

move forward your life is at stake and I'm not saying anything wrong with it I still jump I still dance sir but most of all my concentration is Lord make me like you because even if I never dance again again I want to know that this heart is being changed I want to know that I'm being changed from glory to glory I don't want to look back and say hey I'm the same place I'm in the same place I

yes sir and without it you're going to dwell in darkness amen but if you look through the word you'll see he's the same yesterday today and forever how many of y'all believe that Hallelujah the disciples looked to him when they were in trouble at the trouble sea and they saw the only help they could help the only help that could help them coming so let me let me say like this God puts you in a place right you know it wasn't like no coincident they were on the sea oh no right right he put them there Ah that's good there was no Romans there no sea captains nobody else could help he staged it just like he stages your life amen he puts you in a place your friends won't help you not that they won't they cannot help you and the only one that can help you is in the ship hallelujah oh come on somebody but you got to wake him up wake him up so he been sleeping in so many people's lives for so long you forgot he's there yes somebody help me Martha looked at him in the time of death and saw that he was the resurrection and the life amen amen in time of death Martha saw when she looked at him he had been rejected by her people he had been turned down and even she sent for him and he

turn on the light sir y understand understand me the light has been turned on greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world sir is that all right he have been rejected by her people is that right so but but when when finally he come and she went and fell down so she could do what look up at him when the last time you fell down to look up at him all right all right all right that's what he does he's good at it you won't humble yourself so he does The Humbling yes sir yes sir and then you cry out why me Lord most of the trouble that you going through right now has been caused because

don't let me stop you don't let me stop you Hallelujah he's still filling gas tanks y'all hear what I'm saying I believe when the pressure comes somebody will have the ability no no doubt about it h is that the message that's the word I might need some bread I go over to the brother I said brother I'm out of bread and God speaks through the brother and give me bread sir my God is Jesus Christ Peter needed fish and he went out there he said cast the net on the other side oh it sounds so silly doesn't it well you know we get on our pride I'm a I'm a I'm I'm a professional Fisher I've been out here all day come on you telling me to throw it ain't no fish ain't no fish but I better be obedient at Thy word oh Lord see don't let the devil make you reason the word away I'm I'm I'mma finish I'mma finish on this because I I just you know we look at we looking at this because I want you to understand amen that that uh you know Isaiah saw this burden that was coming the Watchman on the wall saw it you say oh lord it's coming it's coming yeah yeah you can't run from it it is what it is but I believe with all my heart come on now amen such an ability will come in and on the bride yes sir Supreme Grace sir give Supreme faith for the Supreme hour hallelujah hallelujah God is faithful always sir you said well how did they do it the same way you will do it God shows up no human flesh will be able to glory in his presence Hallelujah I'm I'm I'm feeling it but this is it so you understand every time you see a gray hair y'all y'all remember we started out with it's a signed you got to meet God sir amen I want everybody listen to this because a lot of time people especially young people you think you got all the time in the world oh God but I'm going tell you something if it wasn't for your parents many of you perhaps would be dead their pray right am has protected you amen amen M Saints that's why you must live right Hallelujah yes because whatever your choosing is will affect your family is that true aen thought he steal come on now on right and it destroyed his whole family so every decision you make is not just for [Applause] you hallelujah it's for you and your house true every time you bear an ambulance going down the street is a sign you've got to meet God every time you pass a graveyard it's a sign you got to meet God you must meet him this is what I don't understand how can you not there's no way escaping he's all in all he's through all I say in you all I mean he is God can I say it like this he's not bound by time and space sir it's real I was telling somebody the other day I said we got more power invested in us than you realize yes sir true right let a man yawn you can be on the phone and you go and all of a sudden that thing dimensionally go to him H how many times you thought about something or thought about some one and then the phone ring or how many times you had the phone in your hand to call somebody and the phone ring and that's the person yes sir she is there but we ignore it we are we in a different dimension come on now we are setting in Heavenly places in Christ [Applause] Jesus listen God tells you about a brother or tell you about a sister something negative and you say oh I can't go I can't do it watch out now watch out if I told him that you know what if it ain't true you know in your heart you know it's true yeah if you know God has used you like that before come on yes sir yes sir you better obey God I had to do something like that before I left home it was hard yeah I had to tell a brother about his children who they they love they love I love these kids and this little girl how old is she about 78 if that come up and want the Holy Ghost a rebuke to the elders in my church her little brother coming up confessing you know the devil is fighting me to do bad things and I don't want to do bad things God have mercy standing right there as a rebuke to those religious Hypocrites that's right right you we look at these children like they don't know what's going on most of them children most of these children know God better than the other dos I'm almost done but my point is you've got to meet him people of God if I keep this up open and I keep hearing you go on I'm going go on but this is just the beginning of the meetings amen so let me say this by the grace of God we're living in such a time brother brandom said it like this he said in in in Easter seal if you don't mind me just this one he said the a real Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies it doesn't glorify Moses uhhuh right it doesn't glorify Elijah it only glorified Jesus Christ sir it doesn't even glorify himself see I don't care to be nothing like that you know I had opportunities y'all understand what I'm saying yeah yeah you know I could have been no I don't want to be that but anyway I was going to equate myself to one of them preachers but no but my point is this the gift is in the right place I'm right where I'm supposed to be amen amen my thing is this that you got so much in you that that's untouched and untapped but the problem is you're not praying you got to pray you got to connect with God for God to connect with you and this bride of Jesus Christ we are a super Church Hallelujah but to look at us now come on to look at us now we need Revival people say oh I I listen No I'm going tell you the truth don't tell me you in a Revival and you still not living right this revival is not in the head it's in the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] heart when God can change your heart then we'll see an army yes sir that cannot be defeated Satan will hate coming in this building because he know you here oh come on somebody we don't have much time and I'm on my way you hear what I'm saying I've asked God to C circumcise everything away anything let me tell you something it doesn't even have to be sinful that's right but anything that's going to occupy your time when God should be doing that right it becomes an idol I don't want no Idols if I'm going to be a fanatic like somebody say I ain't no fanatic I'm just a Jesus Lover well if I'm going to be a Jesus Lover I want to give him 100% may God in this meeting change our hearts and change our ideas you know the devil got us all thinking that we've got so much time and I'm going to tell you something the the people that will suffer the most come on now are those who have a understanding of this word that's right you call yourself message just like I was telling my church and I'm closing Pastor I said let me tell y'all something there's a lot of people who call themselves message Bel uhhuh that's right in hell that's that's right that's right you understand me yes sir you can out quote me I'm sure you can but that ain't it either right right that's right the devil know how to quote yes sir sir that ain't it it's the life it's the life you talking about you got the Holy Ghost and you all mean people almost hate to look at you you know you got people like that cuz you don't know what they going to say yes sir and yet oh lordy I'm in the I'm in the word yeah you are every
