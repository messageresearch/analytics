[34:10] Lord thank
[34:12] you Lord I appreciate
[34:18] you I believe that he's
[34:21] Arisen as he said he said the hand of
[34:25] the Lord was upon me and carried me out
[34:29] in the spirit of the Lord and set me
[34:32] down in the midst of a valley which was
[34:36] full of Bones
[34:48] to and he said unto me son of
[34:51] man can these bones live and I and I
[34:56] answered
[34:58] oh Lord God thou knowest
[35:11] for thus say the Lord God unto these
[35:15] bones behold I will cause breath to
[35:20] enter into you and ye shall live six
[35:26] will
[35:36] I
[35:37] am so I prophesies as I was commanded
[35:42] and as I prophesied there was a noise
[35:46] and behold a
[35:49] shaken and the bones came together bone
[35:53] to his bone
[35:56] eight
[36:06] then said he unto me prophesied unto the
[36:11] wind prophesied son a man and say to the
[36:16] wind thus said the Lord God come from
[36:21] the fork
[36:23] winds oh breath and breathe upon the
[36:29] slain that they may live 10
[36:43] IES then he said unto me son of man
[36:47] these bones are the whole house of
[36:49] Israel behold they say our bones are
[36:54] dried our hope is lost we are cut off
[36:58] for our part 12 together therefore
[37:03] prophesied and say unto them thus say
[37:06] the Lord God behold oh my people I will
[37:11] open your Graves and cause you to come
[37:13] up out of the your Graves and bring you
[37:16] into the land of Israel God bless you
[37:19] reading this word you may be
[37:22] seated then he says in the 13th verse he
[37:25] says and ye shall know that I I am the
[37:28] Lord when I have opened your
[37:31] Graves oh my people and bought you up
[37:36] out of your
[37:37] Graves
[37:39] and shall put my spirit in you and ye
[37:44] shall live and I shall place you in your
[37:49] own
[37:51] land that's what they're fighting over
[37:55] in Israel God promised
[37:59] and over there now they are
[38:02] fighting because of the
[38:06] land and the Palestinians they want
[38:10] their
[38:11] land but God gave this land to
[38:16] Israel and so the fight is
[38:20] on God says gave them a
[38:24] promise are you with me
[38:28] and they prophesies to the Four Winds
[38:31] for the four corners of the
[38:35] earth and I talked about a a a a
[38:39] threefold
[38:42] resurrection are you with
[38:44] me and he
[38:47] says place you in your own land so
[38:50] Israel said This is Our
[38:52] Land God gave it to
[38:56] us
[38:58] see
[38:59] one they were scattered
[39:03] abroad they were scattered throughout
[39:05] all
[39:07] nations because they had
[39:11] crucified the Messiah that came to them
[39:14] they killed
[39:16] him the Bible said he came into his own
[39:19] his own received them
[39:23] not they didn't receive him when he came
[39:26] because the Bible say say in Romans 11
[39:29] Their Eyes Were blinded for our sakes
[39:31] for the Gentile
[39:34] sake God blinded their eyes that they
[39:38] could not
[39:39] see that was only because God was going
[39:43] to graft into the Olive Tree amen the
[39:49] Gentiles are you with
[39:51] me God was allowing them to be blind
[39:54] that we could be grafted in amen
[40:00] amen so the Gentiles could be
[40:04] partakers of the blessings of
[40:10] Abraham and he went on to say that in
[40:13] Romans that he's not a Jew that is one
[40:16] outwardly but is one inwardly in the
[40:19] circumcision of that not of the flesh
[40:21] but of the spirit amen and of the heart
[40:26] so God in his own way of saying to you
[40:30] and I amen that there is a a
[40:34] resurrection going to take place
[40:37] here and it won't be a resurrection of
[40:41] Simply uh
[40:45] amen ladis but a resurrection of a
[40:50] Nation so I I said a three-fold
[40:54] resurrection God is resurrect in a
[40:58] nation we have seen a nation that was
[41:01] off the map for almost 2,000
[41:05] years over 2,000 years off the
[41:10] map no longer in
[41:14] existence but yet in
[41:17] 1948 Israel became a nation
[41:20] again so we look at
[41:24] history as we study history
[41:28] the Bible is
[41:30] real God is
[41:33] real history tells you that God is
[41:38] real sometimes folks don't want to
[41:40] believe that there is a God that knows
[41:43] it all but God knows the end from the
[41:47] beginning he was able to tell Ezekiel
[41:50] what's going to happen in the future
[41:53] amen
[41:55] amen now if God could do
[41:59] thousands of years before it happened
[42:01] yet we read the Bible and it almost like
[42:05] it's just another book no it's
[42:08] not the Bible is the word of God Amen
[42:13] the Bible says in the beginning was the
[42:15] word the word was with God and the Word
[42:18] was
[42:21] God this is God's
[42:24] word he said Heaven and Earth a passway
[42:28] but the word of God it'll be here it's
[42:32] going to
[42:33] stand are you with me so he says here I
[42:38] place you in your own
[42:40] land then shall ye
[42:43] know that I the Lord have spoken it and
[42:49] performed it said the
[42:51] Lord Israel have not recognized Jesus as
[42:55] their Messiah as as a whole as of
[42:59] yet
[43:02] but it's going to
[43:04] happen and when that happens the Gentile
[43:09] time the church ages are over and
[43:13] it's the Rapture takes place and
[43:17] Revelation 11 with the two prophets
[43:20] Moses and Elijah comes on the scene
[43:23] during the Great Tribulation and the
[43:25] mark of the beast and all of that is
[43:27] that are taking place and if you don't
[43:29] make the
[43:31] Rapture and you're left here on the
[43:35] earth that means the spirit the Holy
[43:38] Ghost lifts off the
[43:41] Earth and you talking about you think
[43:44] it's bad now don't stick
[43:48] around stick around because it's close
[43:52] now Prophet God said Israel is our time
[43:56] piece
[43:58] and Israel tells us time is what time is
[44:02] winding up we are at the end
[44:07] time we don't have long
[44:11] ha the Earth is in her birth
[44:14] pains the world is going through birth
[44:19] pains the Bible tells we know we're
[44:23] there but yet we don't want
[44:25] to you know sometimes we don't want to
[44:28] face the
[44:29] fact that the world has come to its end
[44:33] but it did has now look what's happened
[44:36] to Israel we're talking about a
[44:39] three-fold resurrection now here Israel
[44:42] as a nation and a resurrection taking
[44:45] place for them are y'all with me so
[44:50] Israel comes
[44:52] up from
[44:55] nowhere God
[44:57] the wall
[45:00] Hitler hman and all musolini and all of
[45:03] them started killing the Jews isn't that
[45:06] right and the Jews was almost they had
[45:10] nowhere to
[45:11] go they had no
[45:15] help so
[45:17] after they began to gas him and kill him
[45:21] they got
[45:23] homesick they wanted to go back home
[45:28] so those walls drove them back to their
[45:33] Homeland and the Nations said we're
[45:35] going to give them this
[45:38] land so Israel was able the prophet God
[45:42] said in 1946 the angel of the Lord
[45:45] appeared to him and said Israel has
[45:47] become a
[45:49] nation in 1948 the world recognized
[45:53] Israel amen had become a nation it was
[45:57] saying to Israel to the Jews all over
[45:59] the world let's go
[46:01] home so they got on the airplanes they
[46:04] came out of Africa that came out America
[46:07] that came out of all over the world
[46:09] Israel the Jews went back
[46:12] home and you know what they say never
[46:17] again we'll never again get killed like
[46:22] they killed us under
[46:25] Hitler they gassed
[46:28] them they did all kind of horrible
[46:31] things to the Jews but they said never
[46:34] again so the nation says stop killing
[46:37] they said uh-uh they came and they
[46:39] killed us never again we're not going to
[46:43] let this happen
[46:45] again so they can't stop them so the
[46:48] world almost is turning against
[46:51] Israel are you with
[46:54] me I'm going to tell you something about
[46:56] the World Turning against
[46:58] Israel watch out little
[47:02] bride the natural types of
[47:06] spiritual watch
[47:09] out little
[47:11] bride because the squeeze is on the
[47:15] way if the world is itself is turning
[47:19] against
[47:22] Israel don't you know the world is
[47:24] telling you the church world is saying
[47:26] you must accept all type of immoral
[47:30] living women can marry women man can
[47:33] marry man and all kind of stuff you
[47:36] can't preach you can't say nothing about
[47:40] it if you say something about it then
[47:43] the the world is against the word of
[47:47] God and if you stand with the word of
[47:50] God you're going to be looked at as
[47:52] somebody despised and
[47:55] rejected me
[47:58] meaning only thing you doing is saying
[48:02] the word tells us what's right and
[48:04] what's
[48:05] wrong not because you hate anybody we
[48:08] telling them don't get caught
[48:12] up don't you
[48:14] allow amen your spirit to be caught
[48:18] up with the things of this
[48:21] world God's got a people that's going to
[48:24] trust
[48:25] him
[48:27] and go to stand with him no matter what
[48:30] the word
[48:32] does Israel said amen uh we going to
[48:37] stand never
[48:39] again there's going to be a church
[48:41] that's going to stand up and said never
[48:44] again praise God we're going to stand
[48:48] for the word we're not going to allow
[48:51] amen Satan Amen to come in because the
[48:53] Bible said the Gates of Hell shall not
[48:56] prevail against the
[48:58] church are you with
[49:01] me so you if you open the gates of your
[49:04] heart and allow all kind of chrash to
[49:07] come
[49:10] in you might become
[49:13] garbage are you with me your life
[49:16] becomes a
[49:18] mess your heart becomes
[49:23] corrupt your minds become defiled and
[49:27] rep probation sets
[49:29] in amen when you hear the word you can't
[49:33] even believe in
[49:37] anymore and the love of many going to
[49:40] watch
[49:42] cold so people are they don't they think
[49:46] they're doing God a service if they kill
[49:50] you people don't have any backbone they
[49:54] don't want to stand up for the word no
[49:56] more
[49:57] but there got to be a people that's
[49:59] going to say Amen it might be my mama my
[50:02] daddy my sister my brother I love them
[50:05] but I hate
[50:07] sin how can you love folks God so loved
[50:11] the world and he didn't come to the
[50:13] world to condemn the
[50:15] world and neither do we try to condemn
[50:18] anyone but because of the love of God we
[50:21] tell
[50:22] them that Jesus has come and Cav me
[50:26] means something the cross of Jesus means
[50:30] something it means that he died for our
[50:33] sin somebody said I was born a I was
[50:36] born a sinner I was born a certain way
[50:40] okay let's just look at uh Matthew 28
[50:45] excuse
[50:47] me people are born all kind of ways born
[50:52] Liars some people born with one leg some
[50:57] people bone they can't see some people
[50:59] bone amen with all kind of things bone
[51:03] with different conditions because their
[51:05] parents had
[51:07] them and said the blind man was blind
[51:10] and they said Jesus amen why was this
[51:14] man blind who sin did this man sin or
[51:17] did his parent sin it shows you
[51:21] that what your mama or your granddaddy
[51:24] did you can be suffering from the effect
[51:27] of what they
[51:29] did are you with me he said neither the
[51:34] parents amen and neither this man but
[51:38] God had a purpose in allowing this to
[51:41] happen cuz one day Jesus came amen amen
[51:45] and he healed that
[51:47] man that was born blind brother sister I
[51:51] don't know how you got in the condition
[51:54] that you were in and I don't know what
[51:57] caused your condition but I know that
[52:00] Jesus is here to help you amen and he's
[52:04] not here to condemn you but to save you
[52:08] am
[52:10] amen amen and the purpose of my
[52:13] preaching is not to uh downplay anybody
[52:16] or make anybody feel uh it's just that

[57:11] mechanism he said All Souls is mine but
[57:16] he said the soul that
[57:18] sinth it shall die but Jesus didn't come
[57:22] he didn't come to express to you I'm
[57:24] coming to where y'all can stop doing
[57:25] this and stop doing that and and you
[57:27] better not do this and you better not do
[57:29] that that was the
[57:31] law the law showed you what's
[57:34] wrong but Jesus come to show you I love
[57:39] you I love you I love you I'm not coming

[57:48] the love of
[57:50] God Amen that he cares for you and I
[57:54] hope you see that
[57:56] now uh uh I said
[57:59] uh 28th chapter of Matthew amen I got to
[58:04] be short because we got a lot of folks
[58:07] here and I want you to come
[58:11] back I be you long you won't come back
[58:14] glad to see y'all yall look so pretty
[58:16] over
[58:18] there but I want y'all to come back amen
[58:22] five it said and the angel I 28 and5 it
[58:27] says and the angel answered and said
[58:30] unto the woman fear not for I know ye
[58:35] seek Jesus which was
[58:38] what y'all killed him they killed him I
[58:41] know you seeking that she's at the grave
[58:44] the woman coming to the grave site to
[58:46] anoint the body they coming Mary was
[58:49] coming to anoint the body of Jesus right
[58:52] say I I know you seek
[58:54] Jesus see what I'm saying people come to
[58:56] church and they coming to church they
[58:58] seeking
[59:00] Jesus but they they might be seeking a
[59:03] dead
[59:04] Jesus see sometime folk come to church
[59:07] they seeking a dead Jesus a historical
[59:10] Jesus a Jesus that died 2,000 years ago
[59:15] they're not seeking a Jesus
[59:17] that's are you with me so this woman
[59:22] that Jesus told him he told his
[59:25] disciples he told told him no man take
[59:27] my life a l time I got power to take it
[59:30] up again that he told him amen that I'm
[59:33] going to I'm going to die but after
[59:35] three days as as Jonah was in the uhh
[59:39] the belly of the whale amen three days
[59:42] three I'm going to get up
[59:45] again I'm getting
[59:48] up amen I talk about Israel as a nation
[59:52] being resurrected now I'm talking about
[59:54] Jesus said I'm getting up
[59:57] amen I got power to get
[1:00:00] up the Bible said that his flesh should
[1:00:04] not seek corruption neither was his soul
[1:00:06] left in hell you know he went to hell
[1:00:08] for you and me this is the good news of
[1:00:11] the Gospel that Jesus died and went to
[1:00:13] hell for you and me and what we should
[1:00:17] we should have went but Jesus went there
[1:00:19] for us the Bible said he was made sin he
[1:00:23] went to the Cross he died that we don't
[1:00:26] have to
[1:00:29] die that we can live and have eternal
[1:00:32] life are you with
[1:00:34] me so he says he he the angel answered I
[1:00:40] know you seek Jesus that was
[1:00:42] crucified amen and some people still
[1:00:46] that's as
[1:00:48] far that's as far as they get they seek
[1:00:51] a Jesus uh uh that's
[1:00:54] crucified
[1:00:56] but he said he's not the sixth verse
[1:00:59] said he's not what I'm going tell you
[1:01:02] you can go to most churches around the
[1:01:05] world and they going to tell you I know
[1:01:08] you seek Jesus but he's not
[1:01:13] here they might be talking about him but
[1:01:16] is he really
[1:01:18] there he's not
[1:01:21] here but I said you ought to go to a
[1:01:24] place where Jesus Jesus is
[1:01:29] here the angel said he's not
[1:01:32] here and I I I believe that you can go
[1:01:36] around the globe around Columbia and you
[1:01:38] can go to church and you can say
[1:01:41] huh what is this I'm looking for I went
[1:01:45] it said
[1:01:46] Church look more like a nightclub than
[1:01:51] me it said Church she look like
[1:01:55] Hollywood to
[1:01:56] me look like these people just
[1:02:00] playing these people just oh yeah they
[1:02:03] can sing good they preach good but this
[1:02:07] ain't something ain't right in here I'm
[1:02:09] looking for
[1:02:11] Jesus but somebody said why seek you to
[1:02:14] liveing among the
[1:02:16] dead why you going to seek to living
[1:02:19] among the dead why you going to go to
[1:02:20] the Grave when he told you that he
[1:02:22] wasn't going to be
[1:02:24] there
[1:02:26] then the Bible said it be rich
[1:02:28] increasing Goods said I have need of
[1:02:30] nothing and Jesus was on the outside of
[1:02:32] the door of the church knocking on the
[1:02:34] door and they wouldn't let him
[1:02:36] in are you with me Jesus on the outside
[1:02:39] of the church knocking on the door and
[1:02:42] nobody want to let him in why because
[1:02:46] they're too busy doing their own
[1:02:49] thing they done forgot all about Jesus
[1:02:53] and they're trying to entertain you
[1:02:58] and people so used to being entertained
[1:03:00] that they don't come to church looking
[1:03:02] for a resurrected a a living
[1:03:06] God a God that's
[1:03:12] alive Hallelujah they want to serve a
[1:03:15] dead
[1:03:17] Jesus but not a Jesus that's
[1:03:20] alive they want to serve a dead
[1:03:24] God not a God that's alive the woman
[1:03:28] went to anoint the body she want to she
[1:03:30] really loved Jesus
[1:03:33] but they going to anoint the body
[1:03:35] because they just don't believe he got
[1:03:40] her
[1:03:42] see first of all if she would have
[1:03:45] believe what she what he said she
[1:03:47] wouldn't have never went
[1:03:50] there are you with me but she didn't
[1:03:53] quite catch the Revelation that's why
[1:03:55] she went
[1:03:56] went she carried the first
[1:03:59] message but she wouldn't have never
[1:04:01] carried that message if she would have
[1:04:03] believe
[1:04:04] okay he's not here he's Arisen as he
[1:04:07] said come see the place where he where
[1:04:10] the Lord lay and then he says what go
[1:04:15] quickly seventh verse go quickly and
[1:04:19] tell his disciples that he is what he's
[1:04:24] what

[1:04:33] risen see you got to know
[1:04:37] it amen and people ain't going to
[1:04:40] believe you
[1:04:43] anyhow she had met the angel seen the
[1:04:48] angel looked and saw the grave clothed
[1:04:51] knew that he wasn't there no
[1:04:54] more
