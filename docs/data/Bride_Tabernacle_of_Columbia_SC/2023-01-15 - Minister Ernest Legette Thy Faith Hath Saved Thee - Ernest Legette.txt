but I like how the scripture says that the Good Shepherd he know all his sheep and he called them by name right and it says that you know he'll lead him out you know he won't let him go out on their own but the Good Shepherd standing at the door waiting on the sheep know him all by name I thank God for that that he knows me by name he knows before I was even born before I even come into the world God already knew you and he already knew the decisions you'd make so you know he looked over those things didn't he as I was saying the other night he loved me in spite of all of my wrong and I thank God for that don't you thank God for that this morning you know many of us wouldn't be here today we we didn't have a right to be here today because of the life that we lived it was so many that seemed to be somewhat better that should have been in your place right when man looks at it from the outward appearance but I'm so glad that God through predestination saw me and he looked beyond all my faults all of my wrongdoings all of that God bypassed all of that because he knew that when he went to Calvary and shed his blood that that was going to be enough said don't worry about it my blood will take care of that my blood covered all you got to do is come to me and he shared that with people all the time you know no matter the wrong that you've done God has already taken care of that he already made provision of that all you got to do is come to him he said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden with burdens and I'm gonna give you rest how many thank God for that this morning I thank God for that amen let us bow our heads in a word of prayer as we look to the Lord amen if you have a special needs you can make a known by the lifting of your hands God sees every hand amen thank you Lord we just thank you Jesus for your grace Lord this morning oh God for bringing us into your house Lord oh God allowed us to be able to come together and fellowship Lord under your name God because we know there's no other name under Heaven which men might be saved in the name of Jesus the Lord I pray God this morning that you would look over your children God the hands that was lifted Lord the hearts that's raised oh God surely surely God your people came looking for a blessing God and I know that you've got blessings here to meet their needs Lord God so many God are in need today so many are battling demon powers Spirits wickedness in high places but nevertheless God you gave us weapons to fight with God and one is The Shield of faith oh God that we might be able to quench the fiery darts of the enemy God I pray here today Lord that you might help us God to get out of the way and Lord let your spirit have free reign in this place oh God that you might touch somebody God that mold testimonies might come forth of showing your power and that you're the same yesterday today and forever God we thank you for that Lord we love you we can't say that enough Lord the hands that are lifted the hearts that are raised oh God I pray Lord you know each and every need God you know God their request and as they offer it up to you this morning I Pray by the Holy Ghost

that had a desire to come but couldn't make it to your house today God I pray Lord for my nephew Lord and his eyes I pray you'd blesses us touch them just now Lord God we know it's the enemy God I pray Lord today Lord if we sin or done anything that ain't like you I pray you forgive us help us Lord to be reconciled to you we don't want to miss your blessings we don't want to miss your word Lord we don't want to miss your coming Lord nothing means more than any than you Lord you mean more than anything to us God because without you God we wouldn't be nothing Hallelujah Lord we thank you today bless us now God as we look to you for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen Amen Let Us stand and read another word we want to turn to the Book of Mark the fifth chapter by the grace of God shout out to hold you long amen God is good amen brought us through another week closing our right mind amen life health and strength that means a lot don't it amen God is good blessing my mother to get out the hospital the other day and you know the Lord has worked so many miracles for her and I just thank God for him I asked you to continue to pray for amen because God is so good Mark 5 and 24. by the grace of God we want to continue on from a message we started last week Matt Mark 5 and 24 if you got to say Amen and it reads and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thrown him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and has suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus come in the press behind and touch His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be made whole and straight away the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague I believe so Yvonne said God can instantly do it right like I said she felt it in her body right right away didn't she that God the Healer of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto him thou see is the most too strongly and says Thou who touched me and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing but when a woman feared and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her her daughter thy faith have made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague may God is a blessing to the reading of his words you may be seated this morning this morning by God's grace we want to continue on on something we started on last week thy faith has saved thee amen thy faith has have saved thee you know he told this woman here thy faith have made thee whole but many many places in the scripture we can look and see that you know when God something happened amongst the people or healing took place or whatever might have happened a lot of times Jesus told them he said thy faith may be whole or thy faith has saved me your faith done that come on so I says that a lot of times as we were saying even on last week and I'll say that even here this morning like our sister Yvonne's testimony her faith done that right the sister brother Jackson your faith done that a lot of times you know sometimes we look for certain great things and all these other things but God is looking for your faith he says where is your faith this morning sometimes we like I said we look for the mighty things I remember it was naming her whoever in the Bible when he wanted to be healed from leprosy and they told him to go out there and and dip in the money the Jordan I believe it was seven times and he said well I thought he was going to come out and do some great thing didn't he he says but he all these other places and he tells me to go out there but what it was God was looking for Faith wasn't he so you know he wanted to see what his faith was so I asked you this morning where is your faith because your faith will save you this morning your faith to heal you whatever you need don't you know that faith has the ability to give it to you this morning and a lot of times you know I I says that you know if you can figure it out then that ain't faith come on faith you can't fit if you when you can't figure it out and it comes to pass that's Faith but when you can figure it out and pinpoint how it came to pass [Music] you know he says before any man could come to him he got to First believe that he what that he is God come on so you know and we know that the Bible also says faith comes by what hearing right and hearing the word you know I like how the Bible says that this woman here she had uh uh had this issue so long you know dealing with it in her body and she went to the um all the physicians in the Bible says and she suffered many things come on other positions don't you know sometimes you go to these doctors and I'm not speaking against uh medical and all that because you know we thank God for it amen but sometimes they trying things on you come on trying experiments right make yourself a more than than what it was from the beginning y'all agree with that this morning come on now like I said but the thing is she suffered many things of the physician come on she spent all are living didn't she but I like how it says but the Bible says when she heard about Jesus come on faith cometh by what hearing she heard about Jesus she heard the ability that was in them she heard about the Miracles that he had done and she had she was at her ends with wasn't she she was at the place where she don't exhausted everything else but I heard it's a man that don't care about how much money I got I heard it's a man that don't care about the situation all that and if I could just get to him Hallelujah touch her come on that's what her faith told her didn't it come on we know the Bible says that faith without works is dead right so her faith made her work didn't it the Bible says for the Press come on she pressed her way through that crowd thrown him but she pressed her way through the pain she pressed her way through due to sataness and and all the letdowns over those 12 years she pressed her way through because something in her told her that if I can get to Jesus that he can do for me what everybody else couldn't do and that's what you try to convince people today you got to come to Jesus Hallelujah you know but before you come to him you got the first believe that he can do something for you that he can help you and your condition before you come to him Hallelujah you got to First believe him I was sharing with someone the other day and they were telling me about some situations and they called me and they said you know I called you because I know that I could talk to you and you know I'm hurting real bad and it says that they told me that exact thing same thing they said I'm at my ends with they says that I'm at my ends within them I'm going through and and you know just talking about the terminology that they use they said I'm broken Hallelujah and I began to tell them I says well that's the place that God wants you at you're not exhausted all the other measures you at your ends with you Broken Hallelujah that's the way the master wants you at you guys you understand I said God allowed all those things to happen to you to get you to this place because he was trying to get your attention the whole time and I says that you know you can call me and talk to me and I'ma pray for you I says but that's all I can do is pray for you I can't help you but Jesus can help I said but you got to believe that he can help you because if you don't believe that he can help you you won't come to him you won't pray to him you won't call out his name because you don't see that he can help but I said when you believe you got to believe that God can help your situation you're at your ends with but it ain't over yet amen hallelujah you say heart ain't over yet because God is still alive as long as he's still alive the end ain't here yet all it takes is for him to show up and a new beginning to start right Hallelujah but I began to share with them that and I said that's what we try to do all the time is convince people you got to come to Jesus come on you running in circles trying to repair it and Patch It Yourself Hallelujah but a lot a lot of times the Lord is sitting back watching he'll allow you to do that too run and run around in circles trying to repair it trying to patch it don't get no better come on but when you come to your ends with when you come to that place you say Lord I'm broken I said just like how you told me you broken I say get down on your knees and say Lord I'm broken God I'm at my ends with Lord I need your help I said and watch what God do I say God been waiting on you the whole time to call on his name that's what he been doing waiting on to call him Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever and they begin talking to me they said I know you and I know what God did for you I said if God did it for me there's no respect the person God will do it for you Hallelujah only thing it was is that I heard the voice and I came to him just like I was Hallelujah I like that little song I Came To Jesus just like I was amen weary Hallelujah wounded and sad come on a lot of people wounded this morning come on they warned it because of things happened to him in their life happy to them got them thrown off you know the Bible said that a wounded spirit is hard to bear come on if it's broken sometimes it's easy to repair that but a wound is hard but we serve a God that heal wounds we serve a God that men those broken pieces Hallelujah what he'll do carry you back to that place the way you've been wounded carry you back to that place sometime in your mind where the devil has your captive and got you bound the way you can't serve the Living God he'll tell you back to that place and he'll help you to deal with it Hallelujah I don't know about you but I say I thank God that he helped me to deal with my wounds help me to deal with my situations Hallelujah that I can be free to serve the Living God how many want to be free this morning come on but what I say is before you come to God you got to First believe it right you got to First believe that he is you know I said thy faith has saved thee come on faith that's what it is it's a lot of times we get away from that because everything today is so accessible ain't it so accessible but what is faith we talk about uh those senses those five senses as we're saying here tasty smell all those things that we contact this Rim but you know faith is a sixth sense faith is that sense that that supersedes all those other sins come on what your eyes tell you telling you showing you Faith supersedes what your eyes showing you because your eyes come on assure you you know anything that's going against what the word of God said Is A Lie come on well your eyes will show you things but what did the word say about it hallelujah hallelujah what did the word say about it yo yo yo your touch uh I'll tell you something but what the word say about it your body or how you feel in pain but what did God's word say about it Hallelujah the sense of Faith reaches out to those things don't it reaches out to the things that the census can't can't uh have don't have knowledge of the Bible says that we know that by faith the world's Afraid come on by the word of God and by it the elders obtain a good report didn't they because they believe that all these things we see are a product of what God spoke and if God spoke these things into existence what can't God do today Speak Lord I want to hear your voice Speak Lord I want to hear your word come on because it's still power in the voice of God Amen I believe God speak in the mountain sheet come on you're Tremble When God speaks Hallelujah I ain't talking about with man's speaking but when God speak right come on but thy faith has saved me come on not your money come on not your feeling but your face age like so I can say so many times in the scriptures he told your faith made you whole come on be it as what you say come on I didn't find so great of Faith no not at all Israel this man go ahead just as you say come on just that why because God was trying to show the people hallelujah that the world belongs to you come on everything in it belongs to you got to have faith whatever you say he said why are you marveling when you see this tree weathered away come on Jesus didn't have to get a shovel and dig the tree up come on a poison it and make it die but when he spoke to the tree Hallelujah the next day it was weather they was marvelous right but he said why are you Marvel he said the same power you see in me you didn't have that same power if you believe all you got to do is have faith come on it'll be as you say I said God help us to get to that place oh Jesus I don't know about you but there's so many that's in need this morning so many that need a real God Hallelujah need more than just playing Church clapping hands and singing won't work Hallelujah just hearing A good sermon won't work Hallelujah but we need Faith to bring life to the word hallelujah oh Jesus come on we got real situations don't you got real situations come on and like I said what it is Faith you know Faith supersedes all those other senses because when the other senses failure Faith still says I know it's still possible come on God still bring it to pass you know what we said last week that that hope is the greatest enemy of Faith right because hope hope says that I know God can do it but my body's still hurting and the doctor said this so I hope he'll do it but but you know but Faith doesn't look at that what faith says is it ain't even looking at the doctor's report it ain't even looking at how my body feels Faith said that I am healed with his stripes that's what faith says hallelujah hope is looking for something I'm hoping that God will do it one day Hallelujah amen but faith says it's already now I am overcoming I am a deliverer I am healed right now that's what faith says hallelujah come on but what it is why because it supersedes all those things it supersedes all of the um the other uh senses doesn't it come on and that's what Jesus uh wants us to to reach out to come on that's what that's what he's touched by it wasn't just a natural Touch of this woman come on but it was her faith that reached out and that's why you know the disciples saying Master there's so many that's touching you what what you talking about all these people touching you but if you touch him in the right way if you touch him Hallelujah in a way with a hand of Faith come on not just anybody can just Reach Out And Touch them and don't get nothing but when you touch him right Hallelujah when you touch him because you're in need and God I need I need help Lord God here I am I ain't just touching you because I want a a shout or or look up me and make everybody look at me but God I'm in bad shape God I need your help you don't help me I'm gonna die tomorrow give me an assurance Lord touching God that way something happened I know it will come on I've been there have you been there this morning come on let's look at one scripture Romans Romans 4 by the grace of God thy faith has saved thee come on I says you know faith is something faith is something that that gets us through donut faith faith is is a beautiful thing once we grab a hold to it come on because you come like with like somebody told me you come to your ends with you get to those situations where you just don't know what to do you get to that point in life itself where everything else you don't know where where to turn from here come on and what do you do when you get to that point you know a lot of times people don't look up because they never been instructed to come on but when you give them that option Hallelujah come on that's why you got to tell somebody about Jesus maybe nobody told him about Jesus in the right way come on but when you begin to tell them about Jesus it gives them something to look to it gives them something something in their spirit that they can say look uh I heard about you I heard about it God help me I ain't worthy of the least of thy mercies Hallelujah you ever been there I ain't worthy of it but God I need your help Hallelujah thy faith has saved me Romans 4 and 18 by the grace of God you got it say man and it reads we're talking about Abraham here in history Journey come on we're saying that faith has saved thee who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and be and not weak and what Faith he considered not his own dead body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness come on we send thy faith has saved thee says that's what God is requiring you know you talk about faith you know looking at Abraham being the father of Faith come on one you know I say is that God you know God called him out didn't he call him out he never in the land of his people but yet it was something about Abraham he didn't know who this God was he didn't know where this land was that it was leading them to but by faith he chose to get up from out of his country but you didn't come on by faith thy faith has safety Abraham didn't let nothing shake his faith now we know that even in all all those things I says that his whole his whole journey was a was a built not was built now Faith his whole journey was built by faith come on going out everything that he obtained he obtained it through faith didn't he every move that he made he had to have faith behind that move that he made because God wasn't going to show it all to him right at once but he just said I want you to go here I want you to move I want you to do this right here and I'm gonna bless you come on so by faith Abraham got up and moved come on left the left is country you don't want to go don't handle me come on but I believe that the god that called me is able to perform those things come on so by faith he got up and moved didn't he and that's what God wants today A Child by faith that a get up move then everybody else around you sitting around you they ain't hearing that voice but when he call you out I want you to get up move come on everybody else is saying this and that but by faith get up move I'ma bless you come on let me see your Works come on I ain't gonna show it to you I'm just telling you I'm gonna bless you come on he got up moved but even after that when he went to that land he made it to the land of Canaan oh it was just as the Lord had told him it was going to be but it wasn't long after he got in that land that you know a drought came didn't it come on a drought came not long after he got in the land but did that shake his faith no it didn't shake his faith did it sometimes God allowed those things to happen to try you come on he bring you out you say it by faith God I came out Lord I did what you said you got that season where God is blessing you Hallelujah but what about in the season when the drought has come what about in the season when you're praying it don't look like you're gonna get an answer what about in the season when the dogs are shut in your face I said where is your faith then Hallelujah we all have no Seasons trials don't you know many turn back middle curse their God and die in those situations but Abraham wouldn't like that Hallelujah Abraham knew Hallelujah that I left my father's house I left everything I ain't got nothing else but you God Hallelujah I got no other choice but to trust you now I don't got nothing else Lord so why should I allow my faith to fail I ain't got nothing else to look to Hallelujah so I'm gonna keep looking at him I don't know about you but that's the way I feel amen hallelujah when I came to the Lord he separates it from everything times do get hard times get tough sometimes seem like God ain't giving you an answer that you want Hallelujah but I ain't got nowhere else to go I ain't got nowhere else to turn to Hallelujah I don't have everything else behind I can't let my face fail Hallelujah come on you know and that's what happens don't it faith he didn't let his faith fell him did he come on even in those times he kept the faith didn't he come on I said you hold it out are you keeping the faith but in that he he left that he did that you know he went to so many things went through so many things and uh and God called him out went through so many things but you know I like how the Bible says because we know that he had trials out there in the desert out there in the wilderness you know from other people and going into other lands and had all these battles his nephew got kidnapped and all these things had to fight all these Kings had trial at the trial situation that's a situation and still yet didn't have the promise seed still yet didn't have the greatest promise that God had promised him but the Bible says that he didn't stagger at the promise of God through unbelief come on but he grew strong in faith giving glory to God kept confessing right that God is able to perform it I can't listen to the cloud crowd of noise around me I can't consider my own body Hallelujah like we said faith is the sixth sin he could consider his body his body telling him you owe you dried up come on you Dad and the promise ain't came yet but that sense of Faith superseded that didn't it it went beyond what his body told him getting up in the morning maybe arthritis bones hurting Hallelujah ain't got a child yet but his faith superseded that I can't look at those things or what my body is telling me but I'm looking to the promise of God and what God Said in this word I believe you Lord though my body is yet dead I believe you God that one day you'll do something Hallelujah oh Jesus he kept walking didn't he come on but that's what that sense of Faith did superseded that what I'm saying this morning come on I don't know where you're sitting at what situation you're in but when faith when you turn your faith loose Hallelujah it'll supersede all that what you're going through I told someone the other day I said what the devil's doing he want to get you to that place he gonna twist your mind all up he getting you in that dark room he gonna twist your mind all up and he gonna destroy you come on that's what the devil will do don't he I said but God want to get you out of that place amen the devil is warning you yet the devil warn you God is calling you the devil wants you to come so he can bind you up God is saying come to me I want to give you life more abundant I want you to be free I want to bless you come on don't you know God I want to bless you this morning Hallelujah God want to bless you he don't want to hurt you God want to give you seated abundance Bible you can have something yeah yeah you might go through trials and tribulations but that don't mean God ain't with you because in the fire god of Peter in a flood got to be here in the prison guard to be there oh Jesus the faith come on where's your faith Hallelujah you know these demons are real uh sharing with somebody the other day trying to encourage people come on come to Jesus I'm trying to encourage them Jesus is the answer he's all you ever need Jesus is the one that can help you come on I cannot the church can't help you but Jesus can and that's what we trying to bring you to Jesus come to Jesus Hallelujah you'll get hurt falling behind a man but you won't get hurt following Jesus you'll get hurt falling behind a church but you won't get hurt following Jesus cause we are never leaving off of safety he'll be there in the Midnight Hour Hallelujah he'll speak words of Peace when everybody else is around you speaking destruction talking about you persecuting and ridiculed but God hallelujah knows his thoughts concerning you God knows that though your enemies are surrounding you he'll anoint your head with all won't suffer them to touch them her to harm you come on when all of the enemies are encapped about thousands Hallelujah but the Lord he's just healed Hallelujah and he's your bakla oh I thank God we can look back in the past of so many victories so many trials that God brought us through how we were surrounded by the enemy how we heard so many times the devil's saying it's over with Hallelujah where's your God now but yet we held out Hallelujah we kept the faith and God showed up didn't he Hallelujah little by little God got the victory God showed up how many ever got that testimony this morning where God showed up and I'm so glad that God showed up Hallelujah what did it your faith come on what did it you have faith you have faith to hold out come on you have faith to keep going I always shared a testimony I was telling my uncle once I said as you know the same faith that you used that you had the savior is the faith the same Faith that'll heal you come on because it's faith I said how do you know you were saved you kept testifying I'm saved you gave your life to the Lord you believe that God do what the word of God said you came to God you gave your life to him and you would go around telling people I'm saved Hallelujah you kept confessing it right then you walked into what you became come on and I said faith is that same way come on how do you know you keep confessing it with this strike some healed I'm the Lord that God that healeth to you come on I'm the Lord that God will supply all your needs he'll Supply him according to his riches in glory god I know you're rich you're on every cattle on the hill God I don't have to want for nothing God here I am speaking it what faith doing that right same Faith took the Savior same want to heal you come on speak it come on walk into it Hallelujah hold on to it when the devil tell you to let it go hold on to it I ain't got nothing left but to hold on to it Hallelujah the doctors I'm told you no didn't he the doctor's son gave you a bad report you ain't got nothing else but Faith hallelujah what to hold on to it and supersede that's what it is I said you know Abraham I want to I want to read something here out of the Amplified Bible I said thy faith has saved thee you know looking back over Abraham's life and all of his you know I've been doing some studying on on his life and all of his this week in the past two weeks but all his going through his life and his whole journey was built off Faith coming out calling God calling even after he had the son God said I want you to give him up didn't he 'd go up there but I says that Abraham's Faith Abraham's Faith even when Isaac asked him he says he says uh father I see the fire in the wood but where is the burnt offer Abraham's Faith was he said the Lord will provide himself one come on Abraham knew that yeah God gave me this son as a it was a miracle God gave him to me if he asked for him back I'll give it back to him because I know God can raise him back up that's what my faith is saying that God can do all things come on I believe God asked Abraham once is there anything too hard for the Lord come on and I asked you that question this morning I know you got situations and Trials come on I know you're faced with mountains but is there anything too hard for the Lord come on what can't God do I was looking at the the news the other day and there's talking about the the national uh uh deficit or whatever and the debt the national debt and how it is to the ceiling now and how you know uh and what it what does that mean and all that does everybody know America busted come on money don't mean nothing does it come on it's just like they call it a promissory note but they ain't got the gold to back it up come on they give you money to spend but they ain't got the gold to back it up but God gives you his word and he got the power to back it up don't he come on God God don't give you nothing that he came back up it means something that that word never loses his value come on you said never know it never loses it value matter of fact the more time go on the more value it becomes because we in that time now where the word of God is precious Hallelujah I almost says it was in the days of Samuel I believe it was and the lamp went out come on it wasn't no open Vision the word of God was precious in those days and the word of God is precious today when everybody's taking their own thoughts so even the the sexuality of men and women doing all these things turning upside down come on and they want to kick against the word of God the word of God is precious Hallelujah and just as it was able to save in the old days it's able to save now just as it was able to heal in the old days it's able to heal now it's still able to keep now it's still got power in it come on no matter what the world is saying about it they can't see it but you and I see it Through The Eyes of Faith Hallelujah you know I was studying up on like I said Abraham and looking at how you know some of the uh they don't say he'd be the father of many nations right and how I was looking at some of the Nations that he followed and then you know but many times the archaeologists scientists and all that said that this can't be proven they even talked about Abraham and saying the Torah wouldn't tell after the the um Persian Empire let the Egyptian I mean the Israelites go back the Jews go back to their Homeland that's after that's when the Torah was written so they can't even confirm they said and that was only written because two two different groups of people were fighting over the land so one of them wrote it to say that we got inheritance to this land because this is our father so they said that it can't even be proven come on so they looking so they're saying that this is just pretty much Theory this is just what they saying this is just their beliefs and all that right come on but I say is the thing is by the by you looking to find historical facts and all these things factual you'll never see it come on you'll never see God looking for him that way because God is contacted by faith you'll never you'll never be able to prove it like that if you can and that ain't Faith come on Hallelujah but you and I why they spending all this money all this research going back doing all this right here you and I don't have to do all that come on because God has already revealed it to us come on and by faith we see it and by faith we enjoy the blessings of it to do away with Abraham is to do away with the blessings of his seed right because God made a promise to Abraham didn't he they did not see come on shall all the nations of the earth be blessed and then blessing are bless you come on you and I like I said to do away with that is to do away with the blessings come on you and I to see the Abraham through what faith can obtain the blessings get obtain the promises don't let nobody take your blessing Hallelujah don't let nobody take your promise Hallelujah come on but they'll do that won't they I says that you know trying to find them that way you'll never find them because he's contacted through faith come on don't try to figure it out let your faith go amen right let's see I believe Russian was preaching once turn your faith loose don't let don't try to figure out turn your faith loose come on you know I I got to the point I'm gonna be long this morning but I says there's so many things going on at one time I told somebody the other day I says you got a lot of problems yourself don't worry about nobody else home I told him I said don't spend your energy on that you got a lot of stuff you fighting yourself don't spend your energy on that come on every everywhere you turn what is is battles right people fighting all these things coming at one time but nevertheless I says that those things shouldn't move you because of where is your faith your faith is in God come on your Faith's safe come on if you make it out remember your faith say that save you we were sharing last week so many testimonies your faith done that come on you look at your healings your faith done that you look at the way God made for your faith on that brother Gordon being being able to come back home your faith done that come on we look at and say oh it wasn't all your faith doing that right people praying believing God bring them back all his faith during that come on many so many God testimony you look at it what it is your faith doing that Hallelujah your faith brought it to pass you believe it and God done it didn't it come on I said your faith saved you come on this morning Hallelujah I want to read this and then we'll close hear out the Amplified Bible as a musicians come amen I know that sounded kind of funny but thy faith has saved me amen in the Amplified Bible is here talking about Abraham and and Romans 4. 20 it says but he did not doubt when he's talking about he's staggering out at the promise of God says he did not doubt or waver in unbelief concerning the promise of God but he grew strong and empowered by faith giving glory to God being fully convinced that God had the power to do what he promised therefore his faith was credited to him as righteousness right standing with God not now not for his sake alone was it done but for us as well come on I like that I like that how it says that you know he didn't doubt a waiver and unbelief come on add the promise of God but he grew stronger he grew stronger and then he became he became convinced that what God promised he had the power to do it I said before you come to God you got to First believe that he is come on before you come to God with your situation you got to First believe that he got the power to heal you the power to handle that situation come on you got you can't waver now but you got to believe it that he got the power to do it I said Do you believe God has the power to do it because if you believe it come on if you got genuine Faith then let me see your works you got genuine Faith let me see your Works come on and it'll produce whatever you have neither let us buy our heads this morning Jesus without faith has saved me Hallelujah Jesus Lord we thank you this morning for your grace and your mercy oh God I know that there's clouds out there and that the storm is Raging in lives but where is your faith this morning I said where is your faith thy faith has saved thee thy faith has made the whole your faith did that you don't do it this morning if you would only believe all things are possible how many want to believe this morning how many don't mind lifting their hands say Lord I believe God I thank you Lord I'm reaching out God to Touch the Hem of your garment I heard about

down I failed him but he never failed me never not one time not one time can I look and say God you didn't come through he did he might have didn't come where you wanted him but he always came through
