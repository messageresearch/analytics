God bless Thy word tonight Lord as we open it oh God may you say something to us so God will be a benefit oh God that we can walk oh God in our Christian walk but we ask these things Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen yeah your Bibles you turn with me to the Book of Joshua first chapter the Book of Joshua let's start at the third verse I want to take you somewhat from another angle Joshua one and three notice this is after Moses had went off the scene and God raised up Joshua a man to take the people into the land and give them the inheritance and he says third person every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness in this Lebanon even into the Great River of the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and until the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your course there should not any man be able to stand before the all the days of their life as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and have a good courage for little people that divide for an inheritance the land which I swear to their fathers to give them Lord bless Thy word Sanctified in Jesus name he may be seated amen be we do appreciate you man the Lord and Jesus Christ and amen the things that God is with them in doing Amen in our lives and in your lives but tonight I wanna just share just a little bit um I took it from another angle in Marion but in the night with all the grace but I want to talk about God will not fail thee God will not fail thee many of times and we know in humans their failures we are limited to what we are able to do even after we have said it because of situations or circumstances that may arise in our life and we are not able to keep the obligation or the thing that we really mean to do here and I like to say I know now I'm a learning uh the older you'll get you realize that you have no confidence in any kind of ability you have even your own health is failing us everything around us is failing there's nothing basic you can find that is the same basic anymore the food it causing people to be more sicker than ever before the water I never thought we had to buy water just to get something healthy in our body more people now are trying and it's a good thing nothing wrong with that uh trying to eat better that's good there's nothing wrong but even all of that it's still a fail because Satan and what he is doing in this hour he is contaminated everything there is on the Earth when God made everything from the beginning it was good the food they ate back in the day and you look at it versus what we eating today Lord have mercy but it was healthy they grew it uh they live off the land they live off the thing that they planted without any kind of spring or any kind of chemical the ground will fertile God intended even for us that as we eat the food from the land it had nourishment in it uh it gave you the vitamins that you need in your body uh it made your immune system strong to fight off disease but now that's one of the reasons why people are sicker than ever before because of immune system has been torn down by the things that we eat no wonder you said you have to bless your food and I guess God to Sanctified because we got to eat something and God have to come and do something for us that our food really is not giving us what we need to make up a bone strong and as we get sicker our body needs more time now to heal but in all of that we are learning that God is in control the more you realize it the more it is if you live long enough you'll start learning some things you'll learn one thing that life is like a vapor you here today can be gone tomorrow it doesn't have no age no respectable persons we are living on God's time and that's why my time your time is winding up and I'm learning and leaning every day is my wife saying the song learning how to lean and depend on Jesus because I found out and you'll find out you're gonna have to trust God for everything you have need of because even in your best trying your uh best that you may do in your life many of us have found out sometimes it don't work we fail and then we have to try something else but I'm learning the best thing that we can do is put your trust in Jesus here God was has brought Israel out of Egypt they were in bondage and Egypt was the type of the world God Israel had gotten to a place in their life that the Taskmaster were putting a heavy burden on them and they were in bondage they couldn't enjoy the freedom that God gave them they began to start crying out for God to send them a deliverer and God did so you know when the people begin to cry out to God the Bible said when there's a deep calling to the Deep there's got to be a deep there to respond and when we start crying out for God I believe God will come on the scene and it's crying that God has to get us to a place trouble arises to get us to cry out normally people don't begin to cry out until something calls them to cry out that is the case look what we got going on now there's never a day and never a time that we have something and so much as somebody said look like things are happening so continuously death and killing and the sickness and disasters seem to be arising and arising one over it get over one thing then there's something else you know I believe as Christians when we understand that we have a God that sees and knows everything he knows everything that's going on he sees your situation he sees mine and I like it it's so great because the Bible say God is the same yesterday today and forever in other words there is no fail in God Amen I'm glad that we got somebody that won't fail us somebody that keeps his word so many times it's hard to find somebody that'll keep their word and that I do what they say uh they'll do but I want to tell you tonight that I know somebody who won't fail you I know somebody that is never too late but he is always on time and they're saying this on he's an on time God yes see how many of you know that tonight you may think that God is late because it seemed that your situation then got to a place that where you can't bear it anymore but God sits high and he looks low I'm reminded of Meshach Shadrach and the Bendigo amen when they were faced with a situation that the king uh sent out of the Korean uh wanted them to bow down but they refused to do it tell you something when you face a situation like that and you're facing some Troublesome situations in your life and you have to stand still and know that God is real and I believe if we ever gonna know that God is real you must know him right now uh we as individuals we're going to face thing we're going to have to deal with situations that physically you are not going to be able to do nothing about but I believe this I believe if you keep your hand as they said in the Master Hand he'll come when you need him the most uh Israel and Joshua now was or a little March that God has started something and I I like it because when God starts something he knows how to finish it he just don't start something and say well uh it's too hard now in uh 2023 and I can't deal with all of this y'all got going on now I need to go find some more Revenue no God knows exactly what you need right now oh my it gives me consolation to give me a peace I believe you know when you're going through a storm a lot of time you can't hardly find peace but I believe you can find peace in the midst of your storm and why is not because you're trusting in yourself but you trusting somebody you know that you know he is real and you know that no matter what it is how difficult it may get there ain't nothing too hard for the Lord uh no it doesn't matter what the doctor has told you what he can't do you gotta hire a doctor than that oh yeah because medicine and thank God for all the signs and medicine but there is so much that they can do and that's why I heard the server God said you know evening medicine it don't heals it just AIDS God is the Healer I believe in taking your medicine like you ought to but you know that it still isn't God hand to heal we understand that Joshua had a great commission ahead of him he uh had to come uh behind Moses who had went off the scene and Joshua saw how God moved with Moses and but Joshua commission was different Moses brought him out of Egypt but Joshua was supposed to carry them into the land and divide the inheritance Joshua could no longer depend on what more God were dealing with Moses now God will want to deal with Joshua I believe so many times that so many people get uh uh depending upon a menace person that they can't really see God for themself and I believe that God is now is looking for each and every one of us to know God for yourself you're gonna have to know that he is not what but he is Jehovah Jireh that he'll fight your battle that he will provide for you as he did it for Dempsey now the god that did it there can do it now because it's not a different God it's the same God in that day he dealt with them you know in a natural Lane but in this hour he's dealing with other internet manner but he's the same God he is same in power he is same in Deliverance he is same in Saving he is Sam in healing he is saved in every aspect he ever was he has not changed oh my I'm glad somebody don't change amen all of us change but God don't he changed his mouth he changes the way uh that he dealt with Israel as a nation but now in the Gentiles he's dealing with us individually each of us God is dealing with you in his own way according to your faith that's why it behooves a sister brother if you don't know God now as your personal Savior Please get to know him I mean to know him now is by an experience in by a revelation that I'm not depending on what Daddy them told me do what they told me was good I need to know him myself we can't live off what the early church uh you know done and how God had dealt with them but God's still dealing with us he still wants to deal with a church I'm talking about not Church organization but a body of believers that make up the body of Christ individuals that know that their God the god that we say that that he's serving he's not dead He's Alive you see me where is he at each one of you you are testimony that God is alive because he woke you up we have proof that God is alive he breathed this morning in us the Breath of Life if you don't know him as your personal savior I'll say again please ma'am please sir fine God now while we have a chance Joshua God had was dealing with him now and he was supposed to take the people over into the land because Moses didn't take him to the promised land Joshua dead Moses saw it but because of his failure God did not allow him to go in it but Joshua now the new Commander by the spirit of God and I will Joshua today is the Holy Ghost and he wants to take us not only in the lane but he want to positionally place you in your own lot in your inheritancy each one of us as Christian there is a a place that God has for you and in your position is power so many times that many people do they're always looking at what the other person is doing and sometimes when they look at the other person like that they looking at the man but they don't see that and that's why God tell uh Joshua now as I was with Moses I'm Gonna Be With You see as God was with the early church he gonna be with us and what God started with the early church the Son of God said we are in a continuation of what God started but we're here now to finish it see there was more that God wanted to do but he cut it off but now he picked it up and now he has given us something by the revelation of the word God gave us we know that we are moving into some things that God had promised in the scripture but it had to be somebody that God raised up to be able to fulfill that I want to ask you are we the people or should we look for another I believe we have arrived uh it's no more Peter Paul Elizabeth and those one in the Bible now you are the written word you are the living epistle you are the one God is looking for see you've got to always be for our people and at this at this of of Jim 's position God had called us to a higher calling not just going through a church formality and denying the power thereof but God has raised us up to manifest the very power of God in our very lives God in flesh again 100 devil don't like that he didn't know who Jesus really was but he was God in flesh the very word that was written the very word that was spoken all throughout age Harry was right there on Earth in flesh called Jesus Christ and that's always been the problem that people Miss God because they always looking at the flesh and they missed God in the man it wasn't that Moses was so great and good but it was God in Moses and that same God that was in Moses he got in Joshua and all through the Bible as God did that now he's saying Christ in you the hope of glory you see Christ no more it just um as people say in the church the building no no you the building that's what the Bible say your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost now why you can't do anything with your temple because it's holy if God the Willing place oh my God oh I love that Mercy and we hear that songs of my Lord getting us ready for that great day but I want to tell you this is a great day because God now taking us to a place and listen I like it because how God dealt with Israel but God dealing with us now and God began to tell him to say now don't be afraid he said there are no man to be able to stand before you Joshua he said I've been with Moses and I'm going to be with you I'm not gonna fail you but he said be strong Church fear not little flock I'm with you even when you can't see it I'm there even when things are seem to be all out of order but don't worry little bride I'm right there God was right there with no Hebrew boy all the time he never left them but he'll let them made a choice they had to either tell the king we gonna bow but they made a choice King we're not careful to answer you in this matter it's the even if God don't deliver us oh my Lord see they were not looking they were looking at the Unseen there's the earring of God don't deliver us we're going to buy all see they're confidence that the god that deal with servant was right there with them I hope you know that God is with you those sickness crack your body he's still right there he went no place God doesn't look who want to see how you're going to react Seekers faith don't look at what I'm going through Faith don't look at the circular Faith look at I got the victory come on somebody regardless of how it is I know I got the victory how do you know because greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world God told him only be strong but not in your own self be strong in the Lord it in the power of His might your script and my script ain't in US but our script is in him see and that's why he said that the life that I now live see the life that I I don't live it by my own but I live because of him you know and I know we fail so many times we feel God but even in our failures God is just hmm in other words he looked beyond all your mistakes and he see your heart the people in the Bible they had failures Moses had mine happened but when you confess that and you keep going on because see God don't look at the beginning of a thing the end of the thing see because the race is not given to the Swift it's not when you get it when you come in but rather you can't endure in other words whether you can hold out hold out to the end can you hold out can you uh trust God a little while longer and understand he won't fail you whatever the God allow you to have to deal with is working together for your own good it's building a character in you that you'll be able to stand the wives of the devil and no matter what comes and gold you can say like Joe say I know My Redeemer liveth you I shall not be moved come on do all hell or sell me I shall not Abdul the devil may knock you down I'm getting up see a good man falls seven times but you get back up I tell people I'll tell you man I said says it's not how many times you get down but whether you can get back up and keep going on because if anybody when they fall down can stay down there but it takes a real rugged person to say you know what I'm not gonna quit regardless of how many times I know if I can just get back up that one day God is gonna give me the script to be able to overcome this um Hebrew boys kept going on the king got so mad and he told them to heat that thing up seven times more in other words because they don't want to bow down to me they don't want to obey me that's what the devil see you don't want to bow down to him or or fall down on what he's doing he gets upset and the King said seven times harder oh my seven times and then he went they went up there the Hebrew boys did not flinch one bit they bound them and they started walking and I can imagine you know as we go through other things in this life we Face things obstacles demon powers pressing against you everywhere you go see me you are being oppressed and depressed by demonic powers things in your life and things that their job things that the home things even with you personally I understand that personally we all go through things in our lives and we have to really understand I'm going to trust God and that's what they did they went right up to the fire and look God did not even move didn't say anything to him but he was watching why because he was not gonna fail them and they went up and went there into the fire when the men took them up to the fire they got burned but the Hebrew boy went right down into the fire why because God wasn't going to fail him see that's why God don't take you out of that situation but God I give you script to go through it somebody said if he bring you to it he'll see you through it but God know what you can bear now I'm saying he won't put no more on you he knew the Hebrew boys could bear that fire he that went right down there in it and when they got in it the king said hey hey y'all all right this okay we all right what happened even the fire that the Devil Makes for them wouldn't touch them why because God is a consuming fire not one hair off their head nothing even scorched why because God is not a failure if God promised I'll be with you I'll be in you to the end of the world God will do it he's not an Indian giver God don't say something he can't back up if God said by my stripe you are healed go ahead and praise the Lord for it go ahead and confess it say I got it I don't see it but I got it come on whatever you going through just stop confessing I got it yeah I got it what you mean you got I got it because God said I got it now we do he said every place that the soul of your foot thread upon he said I'm giving it church let me tell you something Lord have mercy even the Bible say the footstep of the righteous is ordered by the Lord God will even take your mistakes and turn them around to your own good but God already know you don't you know God already know you he know every turn you're going to take in your life and God is a lot go ahead but I'm going to assure you I'm going to take this very thing and something that was a turning point in your life that you had no idea that you've done this and then God begun to turn it around for your very good you say oh my God so many times I look now back on life the things that happen you know in my very life and I said Lord you were in it all the time and I didn't know it was church you don't know that there are many things God allow to take place and that thing might have turned you from really being destroyed and then God began to open up your eyes and you can see I protected you all the time when you should have died in that car I was the one when you should have been destroyed I'm the one that brought you out of your situation come on somebody be encouraged that God will not fail you God bless you you never failed me yet Jesus Christ never failed me yeah and everywhere I go I want the world to know
