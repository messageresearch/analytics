lord bless our pastor lord and family bless the ministry here lord god and the people lord we pray god lord that you just bless the word tonight lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen if you have your bibles tonight you want to turn to the book of ephesians ephesian the fifth chapter and it's kind of a continuation of something that i had spoke a little while ago in season five and i entitled it redeeming your time redeeming your time [Music] the book of ephesians 5 13-20 but all things that are reproved are made manifested by the light for whatsoever do to make manifest is light wherefore he sayeth awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ should give thee light seeing then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and be not drunk with wine wherein excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing making melody in your heart to the lord giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ let us pray father god we want to thank you tonight lord for your mercy and for your grace lord pray god that you will bless the reading of the word lord and let the spirit of god lord give us understanding lord help us oh god to understand the hour and the day that we are now living in father we realize god that darkness is covering the earth lord gross darkness like never before lord everything has been shaking lord in the country the world every nation god has been shook up god by what's going on oh god but you said lord there will be light in the evening time lord and we are so grateful for the mercy and grace that you have allowed us of god to be partakers of what you are doing in this hour a lot of our hearts are made glad oh god but yet lord is a sad time for those that don't know where they're at lord is walking around in darkness and missing the light oh god that you sent forth oh god but help us tonight lord to walk in it lord and live in it for we ask these things in jesus name amen and amen may be seated like you said we it's a continuation of something that i'd uh believe a good while back i started it and kind of dropped off of it but uh wanted to try to come back and maybe rehearse or reiterate and by god's grace hopefully that we can just try to uh encourage you and and get you to understand uh where we're at uh uh the bible said that here that uh seeing then that we walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise in other words what it's saying here that we we uh are careful how we are living our lives in a dark world that we are living that's full of corruption and that so much is going on all around us that everywhere you turn there's just uh gross darkness everything just seems to be corrupt and he's saying here that but we are not like food but we are wise we understanding the hour and and the day that we are living in and we'll realize that no matter what the political world may uh try to give good speeches about the country and bringing things back it'll never come back will you realize it'll get worse and it'll get worse but with god in this hour has has shined a light and that light that he shines it causes us to walk and to live circumspectly we don't want to get entangled with the yokes and the things of the world but we realize that we're at the end of all things regardless of what they might do regardless of who is president we realize that nobody can bring it back it's been prophesied that you know it's doomed yet they're trying to rebuild something on a foundation that has been destroyed but we you know is give us great honor and not to be proud but to be uh so grateful that god had chosen you and i to reveal the things that he has done in this hour not only what he's done but to let us know how to escape it how to live our lives and how to govern ourselves that we won't get caught in the trap of what the world is trying to mold in redeeming your time and i i really believe that uh just like without this remembering every uh incident special that happened to the country that impacted the country um it's jelly is a a repeat you know after it has happened and after it's settled down seemingly the people go right back and continue to do the things that they always did not taking any notice that uh they are living on sinking sand and that it could be over in a few hours your life my life and their life but they take no really uh a thought or you know that you know where am i at what do i need to be doing because you got a soul that you're going to have to give an account for you're going to have to give an account for the life that you lived i was telling some people the other day you know we uh sometimes because of uh you know the message of the hour that god sent us and uh and to some people you know it is it's just a message that brother branham brought but uh and all the things that he has spoken to us and and prophesied he went right back to the scripture to show us where we are at and that i listened to him you know he was so impacted that it could have been over back then and he felt intensity as he traveled and look at the condition of the country that where are we at brothers it's over and he just felt that empire i said lord if he felt that way back then you know how much more are we have to feel the impact of what's going on now we've heard and we have seen uh the things that god has spoken to us in this hour and sometimes they see them like it don't do nothing just words that's been uttered and things that has been said and we get a little you know move by for a day but after a while we go right back into the same nominal church routine you know our hearts and our spirits you know are not stirred and we are not crying out and and seeking god lord i need more we can't just sit around and be like everybody else we ought to know if the holy and i know it takes god to do it it takes the holy ghost to really uh do something in our lives that we can feel that the spirit of god is saying it's over prepare yourself or else are you going to be caught in it but the world the church world you know it seemed to be uh you know going and doing the things that they always did and people seem to be still uh good religious people and that loves to go to church and and talk about it and sing about god but there seems to be no reality there seems to be no impact that we are thirsty and we are hungry for oh lord don't let me get cold give me another stirring don't let my life be just a social life but lord i want to be stirred i want to be filled with all your lord do something in my life and that is something that i realize each individual is going to have to come to each individual god has to place that kind of thirst in your heart that when you were looking at uh your life and you looking at the condition around you and at home at work wherever you go all you see is chaos corruption people are probably saying people's hearts are failing for fear for the thing that is covered upon the earth and they don't know what to do they're looking for answers they're looking for uh what we got to prepare or are we ready for it now we we prepared for the next one but you don't know what it is no my so how can you really prepare for something and you don't know what you're preparing for but god in this hour it has made known to us what's going to happen he have spoken it and showing scripturally that uh the whole world is going to go into a state of insanity and here we are living in a world full of insanity people have done lost their minds and then lost control of what they ought to be doing and it got into the place that they don't know what to do right become wrong and wrong becomes right whatever a person decided to do did is do it not even thinking about the consequences but i pray tonight that we are who are the light we begin to examine where we act and to understand that we're at the end of it don't get comfortable don't get caught with the worlds and worry about this and that but set your mind on the things above oh my thinking about that song israel is shaking you know and how people are just going about like every other day you know and i know to realize that we've got to be uh mindful of what we are dealing with and what's going on around us but more so you know you want to find out lord uh whatever you're doing in this season lord don't let me miss it see because be the trouble of god said you know in the darkest hours that's when the supernatural takes place when things seem to seem so chaotic and and out of proportion god begins to move supernaturally and because the people have been distracted and moved from their spiritual walk they'll miss it but i pray tonight that you won't miss it because you know what you are looking for by by the word you know that what god promised you god is going to fulfill it oh my god something here it says here redeeming the 16 were redeeming the time because the days are evil there has never been a time that uh we are living in a day that i mean beyond corruption we have passed sodom we have passed the days of noah we have gotten to the place that if i be the servant god said that if god if it uh uh would cause solomon to raise up and let us get by with he have to repent because the people imagination and their mind had gotten so far beyond what's called natural we have lost the sense of what's decent and what's godly and what's ungodly i i was telling somebody you know that i was in my i was dreaming and and i was preaching a funeral and i was preaching you know that holiness is right regardless of whatever's going on holiness is right and i was just preaching and preaching the holiness is right you know and then you look at people that can't even discern what's holy and what's unholy because man had done made themselves a fake leaving religion and they have made uh uh a bylaws that as long as you doing this and that you are right and then they pacify the people that are all everybody's sin and come short yeah but you don't practice it you don't just use it as a cloak you do all that's within you to do to stay away from unrighteousness and if you fall short you got an advocator somebody to plead your case but just to go out and just sin and come back and say i got forgiveness oh sister brother please don't practice that but that's what the church world has done they've given the people this type of social standard that god understands let me tell you i don't know what what they think god really is about but god is holy god is not going to accept nothing else but holiness and i ain't have a in this church you know i'm talking holiness living where our life is measuring up to the standard that god placed in the word that's god's standard regardless of what anybody else said it's the word that is the standard but the people have left the standard and they made themselves a standard that god ain't even in it they're presented to the people and then the people become religious folks with a standard that have been artists created by some organization system and then god began to call and say come out of it come out of her my people don't be partakers of it see there's a call in this hour there's a call for us to be separate there's a call to be holy but the only way you can do it is get the holy ghost in you the only life that can present you folks before god is the holy ghost not churchy not religious act but the very life of god living in you the hope of glory what house will you build him what church will you build him god is not in a building made by hand but your body is the temple of the holy ghost that's why you can't do anything with your body you can't just lay around and gobble up this thing with your body because that's god dwelling place you are the living temple of god you are the living voice of god in this hour and god wants to present you holy oh my i just have to read it y'all forgive me romans 12 it's my pet scripture 12-1 look like this has been on my mind so much and look like evie i have to just read it because i'm just wringing out something that i believe that what god is calling us for to his perfection he said be ye perfect you say brother how can i do it you can't do within yourself but the holy ghost does it god living in you presents you perfect i know we see our faults and we see all the deals and that but god said what you talking about i don't even see what you thought you've been washed in the blood i've took away i've erased you have no sin i took your place now you can take my place i became sin for you that you can become the righteousness of god so when you are living a life deposit a life that i now live i'll live it by the son of god amen oh that life it it's urgent and i but this time expounding to the people that you know in all your getting get the life giver don't worry about the knowledge don't worry about gifts don't worry about you know how good you can preach or saying or play music but get the giver get the very source of life that's what he's looking for he's coming back for his own reflection he wants to see himself in you he doesn't want to see you but he wants to see christ the hope of glory tabernacle in an earthly vessel in colombia paul say here you see i beseech you you know what i'm pleading therefore brethren by the mercy of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service see it's your reasonable service paul said another place he said examine yourself each one of us got to take inventory when when you international when you look in your mirror at your house before you leave home you see yourself standing there and you looking to see whether things are decently in order so when you look into the mirror of the word you want to say lord where am i at i need a checkup lord i need a more from you because i realize that it's going to take more in this hour you know i also was saying you know that when god gave us god made known to us the mystery of god and brought us back into fellowship with god and you know we're rejoiced by what god has given us and it's so much god had pulled out on us sometime to where sometimes i think we don't know what to do with it you know when you have a lot of something you just waste it you know like you give children so much to eat or whatever you know what day let's pick one little french fry and leave the whole everything else on the plate because if you give them small portions then they can eat it and i think sometimes you know i know for sure the bible said when much is given much is required we have been giving much we have been given the complete revelation of jesus christ in this hour no other age has had this that we of god they have their potion but here in the winding up we have part of theirs plus what god has given to us and so the truth that we have yes we have truth but you got to remember now it's going to be more required of you you're not going to get by with just sanctification of being justified you're going to have to have a more than that so it's good that we have the message but we are going to be hell accountable what are we doing with it just reading you know about the things of god and sometimes you know i understand i had an incident the other day that a young man who i'm working with a foreigner it's another elderly man that a christian man you know something years old you know and i don't say much to people so much about religion because it's such a touchy area i generally try to wait for an open door that where they'll open up a conversation and then i can you know so if they get a little easy about it i said well you don't want to ask the question are you the one that brought it out but this man here a really kind of a nice man he lived right near where brother gerald lived at um and he uh was talking the other day about you know the end time and the boss man who we work for he was there and he's a a baptist preacher and they were sitting there and they was talking you know about the election and how uh the ends of the time coming and things and so i don't know i just felt at that time it's your opportunity so i took advantage of the open door and and you know sometimes you don't know who have heard the things that we thought that nobody had to hear but this man began to expound and i'm saying sir i said uh bruce i said look i said y'all all know about uh the earthquakes and uh uh the pestilence i said but there is a scriptural voice that that god has sent forth in this hour to to uh restore the people faith back to god again and and then this i said god has sent a message in this hour and the older young man he said yeah he said i i've heard about it i said you did i said where and he said um there's a a man in walterborough nameless wrath something they supposed to with some kind of prophet he called himself and he got some compound there in walterboro that people were living on uh on the on from property and he said that this guy was saying that um you know how he's the last they messenger and i said wait a minute i said i said you ever heard of william branham then he said yes he said ralph talks about him he said yeah he said he was the sixth angel and ralph's saying that he was the seventh angel and i said really i said my brother i said now god don't have two messages in the same generation i said there's one message that god set and make that known i say mr wrath is only gleaning from what brother branham had taught us he said really he said well but i just was amazed that you never know what people have heard you know so it behooves us that as you said redeeming the time and it's actually speaking about taking advantage of the opportunity when it's given to you because though he heard what he heard and he got it all messed up you know what ralph i don't even i never i heard of them but i never heard of them and he got it all twisted up and messed up so there was opportunity for me to take advantage and just to try to show in the preaching he was sitting there with his mouth open like because he never heard none of it and he been looking you know like you know almost what are y'all talking about and i said bruce i said look i said if you want to talk let's talk i said but you need to know where you at we we need to know we can't just be preaching preaching and nothing is is transforming our people alive i say because god is gonna hold specials preachers accountable for what we're preaching to the people so we ought to even when god gives you an opportunity you ought to be a witness i believe is there ever a time now that we need to be a witness because people's hearts are shook up they are broken they are afraid they don't know what to even look to because now all hope is gone let me just read something and i'm closing i wonder let me read one a scripture out of the book of colossians colossians i don't know about you church but i'm really i'm stirred you know because i realized that we don't have time to waste anymore by the same time passed god went at english but in his last days we can't just continue to go on like everything is all right we got to be certain we got the goods i'm just not talking about a message that we've heard but i'm talking about the power of god that can change us prepare us for the rapture we get to be prepared for the rapture we got to be pressurized we got to really get out of ourself and lay us out every weight and understand that i don't have time to be dilly-dallying around in here anymore i don't have time to be wandering looking and saying well this and that no lord let me search me lord search my heart search my reigns lord if anything that's in me lord take it out make my heart pew lord have mercy colossians 1. 1-9 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that he may walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god strengthened with all might according to his glorious power until all patience and long and long suffering with joyfulness redeeming our time let me read this and i'll turn over the message spoke here about wonders to perform he said it was it was while those went to emmaus along the road and began to talk about him that he stepped out of the bushes and walked with them through the day he said the reason we don't have the spiritual blessings we have too much time to watch television oh we don't watch television but we watch twitter and facebook and all of those things he said too much time to read the newspaper too much time to listen to something that we ought not to be listening to and we are not redeeming the time but we giving it to the things of the world instead of our time to the lord jesus and the bible said that man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god what kind of people are we to be after all that god has made known to you and i in this hour after all that god had uh revealed in this hour exposing the works of the devil letting us know about the anti-christ and exposing all those things that we can escape it and yet sometimes we seem that we not understanding that it's time to go home church let's pack up let's lay aside every weight every sin let's just let it go anything that's a hilarious then let it go you got to run this way with patience you got to know what the will of the lord is for your life you got to be certain of god in this hour no more going up to and fro and wondering well i'll do this is that right i don't know but i no no no no no you got to count up the cause now you got to really know that what am i doing have i suck god on it because you want to be found in the will of god and not just doing anything i think no we can't even afford to make uh the drastic mistakes about fame because it's costing us god bless you tonight praise god let's redeem the time because the days are evil amen the day of redemption is near men's hearts are failing because of fear look up because our redemption is near so by the grace of god we thank god for the word tonight like to say it's time to run amen it's time to run for your life praise god if you don't if you look around us now and see what is going on amen everything is speaking back to us man don't know which way to turn and the political world is in a shamble the medical world is in a shamble everything is falling apart we need god to come by the finance is in a terrible shape people are so indebted so they need a superman the world needs a superman and we believe that the world will get their superman soon but there must be a super race come on the scene to shake the world one more time with the power of the holy ghost won't be many but just a few he said those that have turned the world upside down they come here may there be one in the city of columbia that will turn the city upside down one in south carolina that would turn the state upside down oh yes there's one in a million praise god and there's got to be somebody that get a hold of god somebody's not talking about how they're going to get a hold of god but somebody that's got a hold of god when they speak demons tremble praise god act our word lord amen i just read what man of man is this amen that can speak to the wind and speak to the sea and say peace be still and it obeys him they said what man of man is this praise god jesus ought to be the same jesus inside each and every one of us the same jesus doing the same things in our lives praise god they ought to say what matter uh uh uh uh a woman is this what matter uh uh uh uh a student is this in the school what manner person is this glory to god for when they come something is happening the power of god is with them the supernatural is moving they got something amen that makes the difference you got to have it oh yes we can't talk about god we got to bring him on the scene we got to call jesus on the scene amen and people gonna see jesus christ in you is that same jesus that we talked about two thousand years ago that shame jesus is in me and i got to pray amen until the jesus show up in my life to that same power with same attributes amen and god can identify itself by its own characteristics in our lives brothers and sisters time that praise god we amen oh hallelujah praise god start saying who's that in the mirror and then we find out that that's me that's me amen that's me see yourself in the word that's me praise god i can identify amen with that word because i find out amen american poet and said isaiah 7 14. she can say that's me isaiah 40. john can say i that's me and you ought to be able to say back to me when he spoke of a super race super church talk about a church without spot a rank of blemish or any such thing that's me that's me amen you ought to be able to say that's me amen that same power as they said this is that which is spoken up by the prophet joy and in the last days said god i poured my spirit upon all flesh you ought to be saying that's me god has pulled out his spirit amen hallelujah and the spirit of god the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel amen you ought to see it in your action amen the tree is known by its fruit there ought to be actions in our lives amen manifest jesus christ and they can see plainly that jesus christ is god bless you let us stand amen jesus christ the revealed word of the hour praise god is not in the letter
