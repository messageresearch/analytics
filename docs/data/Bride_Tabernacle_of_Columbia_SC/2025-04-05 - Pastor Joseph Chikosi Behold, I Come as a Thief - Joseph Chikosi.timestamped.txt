[46:41] [Music]
[46:44] The Lord bless you all. Amen. You may be
[46:46] seated just for a while. I want to greet
[46:50] you all in the wonderful name of the
[46:51] Lord Jesus Christ and I deem this a
[46:54] grand privilege to be back again among
[46:57] you after quite a while. It has been a
[47:02] long time that I was here and uh I I I
[47:06] think the church has taken a new look.
[47:09] It's not what it used to be when I knew
[47:12] it several years back. And I'm looking
[47:15] at some
[47:16] faces that have really changed since the
[47:21] time I met them. Uh somewhere in the
[47:25] ministry and uh some are a bit more with
[47:30] more wisdom. uh the hair is turning gray
[47:34] and
[47:35] uh we thank God that we can still meet
[47:39] and still uh are enjoying the same
[47:43] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:46] Amen. There's something about the
[47:49] gospel that it never fades.
[47:53] Its power never changes. The gospel will
[47:58] never lose its power. Amen. And uh as
[48:02] the blood of Jesus will never lose its
[48:04] power, the gospel also will never lose
[48:08] its power. I remember those days when it
[48:13] was pastor Henry Simmons really that
[48:16] opened the door for me to come and have
[48:19] several meetings and to get to meet the
[48:21] brothers here. And uh I will never
[48:25] forget him and his wife, their
[48:29] hospitality. I I I I stayed in their
[48:32] home. They took me around. And uh uh
[48:37] whenever I think about that, my heart
[48:40] really really is thrilled to know that
[48:43] we have genuine Christians and genuine
[48:46] servants of the Lord with the love of
[48:48] God flowing through them. And I want to
[48:51] really appreciate Pastor Simmons and say
[48:54] thank you very much. And uh though this
[48:57] time around when I was coming, I didn't
[48:59] have it planned that I would come this
[49:02] way as I was going through Charlotte and
[49:06] and so brother Aaron made contact and
[49:10] arranged that I also passed through
[49:12] which was very very uh good for him to
[49:15] do that. But I would like to come back
[49:17] when I have more time and just be mainly
[49:21] with you and a few other groups around
[49:24] and and and enjoy your fellowship. And
[49:27] my wife has been very thrilled also to
[49:30] get to know to meet the different
[49:33] people. We were in Marlins yesterday and
[49:36] we also had a wonderful time and I'm so
[49:39] thankful that my wife has been a real
[49:42] support and we have we we have been
[49:45] around for some time. I think today
[49:48] being the fourth, it would be just a few
[49:51] days over a month that we've been
[49:54] around, but we've been to New York,
[49:56] we've been
[49:58] to Minnesota, we've been to uh
[50:02] Seattle, uh we've been to uh Phoenix,
[50:06] we've been to Tucson, we've been to
[50:10] Florida, we've been to Charlotte. Now we
[50:13] are here. So, we've we've we've traveled
[50:17] around your country more than some of
[50:20] you have
[50:24] done. And the Lord has been so good. He
[50:27] kept us healthy. You know, when you
[50:29] travel from place to place, the
[50:32] different temperatures, different
[50:34] weather, and all that. When we when we
[50:37] went to Minnesota, it was very, very
[50:39] cold. uh but the Lord kept us and you
[50:43] know traveling from place to place and
[50:45] changing uh airplanes and today you are
[50:48] sleeping somewhere tomorrow you're
[50:50] sleeping somewhere and um usually the
[50:54] human being and even even in the animal
[50:57] world
[50:58] uh somewhere where you you sleep is is
[51:03] is something that's so special to you
[51:06] because after a day's labor you want to
[51:09] go to a youth usual resting place and
[51:12] and and you know pull your blankets over
[51:15] on you from usual usual premises and
[51:19] usual quarters and so you can imagine
[51:22] having to change place and so on and so
[51:24] on. You hardly can sleep. You get a
[51:26] little bit nervous and but we thank God
[51:28] who has really kept us and we thank God
[51:31] for the hospitality that has been
[51:33] extended to us. And so tonight I'm so
[51:36] thankful. I would like just to approach
[51:39] the word of the Lord. And if you are
[51:40] here with a need, if you are sick or you
[51:43] want God to do something, we live in
[51:45] such a needy world. We all have so many
[51:48] needs. But God is more than able to do
[51:52] even more abundant, exceedingly
[51:54] abundant, more than we can ever think or
[51:57] even ask. And we should never despair.
[52:00] We should never lose hope. We should
[52:03] never come to a place where we say,
[52:05] "I've had this problem for so long and I
[52:08] think it's just there to stay." No, God
[52:12] is able. Is anything too hard with the
[52:15] Lord? No. All things are possible to him
[52:19] that can believe. So if you believe,
[52:21] let's stand and if you have a request,
[52:23] you can raise your hand to God. And as
[52:25] we start, I will pray and commit you to
[52:28] God. And I believe that the prayer of a
[52:31] righteous man availth much. And we don't
[52:35] have our own righteousness, but he gave
[52:38] us his righteousness. So I want to
[52:40] approach the throne of mercy on your
[52:42] behalf, presenting your need and your
[52:45] request. And even to those who are
[52:48] streaming or who will be following on
[52:50] Facebook or on the on the internet and
[52:53] those that may listen, if you have a
[52:55] need, just raise your hand as we pray.
[52:59] Gracious heavenly
[53:01] father, it's always our
[53:03] joy to speak to
[53:06] you because we know who you are and we
[53:10] know what you have done for
[53:12] us. You saved us. You picked us up.
[53:18] You picked us up from the merry clay.
[53:22] You turned us around and you set us on
[53:26] the king's highway. We thank you so much
[53:29] for this gift of eternal life. And Lord,
[53:33] as we start the service, the preaching
[53:36] of the word is not complete without the
[53:39] healing of the sick and the
[53:42] manifestation of your power, your
[53:45] presence, your
[53:48] deliverance, oh outstretched arm, to
[53:52] give, to provide,
[53:54] to supply each and every need. and we
[53:57] humbly approach your throne of mercy
[54:00] knowing that we do not deserve
[54:04] any of your blessings
[54:06] but you took our place you died on the
[54:10] cross of Calvary and you said it is
[54:13] finished so we are believing in that
[54:15] finished work that each and everyone
[54:18] that have raised up their
[54:20] hand will receive their heart's desire
[54:24] and may they come
[54:26] back before your presence with
[54:30] thanksgiving after you have answered
[54:32] their prayer. Now Lord, as I stand here,
[54:35] I commit myself to you the scriptures. I
[54:39] I pray that you anoint the scriptures
[54:42] and that and that you also give me oh
[54:44] God anction of the Holy Spirit to be
[54:48] able to speak the uncarchable riches of
[54:51] Jesus Christ. Father, we thank you as we
[54:55] ask these blessings even upon this local
[54:58] church. I ask these blessings upon our
[55:01] pastor
[55:02] here, the
[55:04] officers, Lord, the ministers that work
[55:06] with him. Father, may you bless them and
[55:10] may you bless the burden to reach out
[55:13] for that last one. We are waiting for
[55:16] that last one to come in and we will be
[55:19] gone. We thank you in Jesus' name we
[55:23] pray. Amen. Amen. Let's read in our
[55:28] Bibles from three portions of the
[55:30] scripture. I wish to read from the book
[55:32] of 1
[55:34] Thessalonians
[55:35] chapter sorry second.
[55:39] No. Yeah. First first Thessalonians
[55:41] chapter 5 from the second verse. First
[55:44] Thessalonians chapter 5 from the second
[55:47] verse to the third verse and then
[55:50] Revelation chapter 16 on verse 15 and
[55:55] then also Revelation
[55:58] 22 on verse 20. We will read if you
[56:03] found it first
[56:05] Thessalonians 5:es 2 and 3. For
[56:08] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[56:12] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[56:16] night. For when they shall say peace and
[56:19] safety, then sudden destruction cometh
[56:23] upon them as travail upon a woman with
[56:27] child, and they shall not
[56:31] escape. Revelation 16 on verse 15.
[56:36] Revelation 16 on verse
[56:39] 15. Behold, I come as a
[56:44] thief. Blessed is he that watchth and
[56:46] keepeth his garments, lest he walk
[56:50] naked, and they see his
[56:53] shame. Revelation 22 on verse
[56:58] 20. Revelation 22 on verse 20. He which
[57:02] testifith these things saith, surely I
[57:06] come quickly. Amen. Even so, come Lord
[57:11] Jesus. The Lord blessed the reading of
[57:13] his word. You may take your seats
[57:16] tonight. I wish to speak on behold I
[57:19] come as a
[57:22] thief. And my running thought there is
[57:25] the secret sudden coming of the Lord
[57:29] Jesus Christ.
[57:32] The scripture plainly tells us here that
[57:34] the day of the Lord will come as a thief
[57:38] in the night. And we all know that a
[57:42] thief doesn't come
[57:44] openly when the occupants of the house
[57:48] or the property or whatever he wants to
[57:52] steal when they when they're wide awake
[57:54] and and watching over what belongs to
[57:57] them. The thief waits and watches for
[58:01] people to sleep. Then he
[58:04] strikes. And that's how the come of the
[58:07] Lord is going to be. There will be no
[58:10] public announcement of his coming. And
[58:14] that alone is so contrary to our modern
[58:17] trend of
[58:20] thought because nothing happens without
[58:23] it being
[58:24] planned, well announced and well
[58:29] advertised in this life that we live in
[58:31] today. Everything that is important,
[58:34] everything that is very special, whether
[58:37] it be a wedding, whether it be some
[58:39] important event, it has to be announced.
[58:43] But contrary to this, the coming of the
[58:46] Lord is secret.
[58:50] There will be no public announcement.
[58:52] The coming of the Lord will not be
[58:54] announced in the manner of the way
[58:57] events are published
[58:59] in in the bulletin channels, the
[59:03] newspapers, the TV channels, the
[59:06] internet, the social media, the
[59:08] Facebooks and and all the streaming that
[59:11] we have today. Today you can have news
[59:14] flashing the whole world in just 5
[59:17] minutes. Something can happen today,
[59:20] right now, and before you know it, it's
[59:23] all over Africa. It's in Asia, it's in
[59:27] Europe, is everywhere because of the
[59:31] internet and and and and and the social
[59:34] media. But the announcement of the
[59:36] coming of the Lord is not going to be
[59:38] like that. It won't be announced in that
[59:41] manner. It is a secret
[59:45] coming with also a secret announcing
[59:50] because the Bible has told us there
[59:52] that yourselves know perfectly this time
[59:57] that you know it. Paul says I don't even
[1:00:00] have to tell you this again. You know
[1:00:03] this perfectly well that the day of the
[1:00:07] Lord comes as a thief
[1:00:10] in the night. Amen. So there will be no
[1:00:13] announcement and it won't go
[1:00:15] viral on the WhatsApp groups and
[1:00:19] the and all the uh the media platforms
[1:00:23] that we have and and and and and the
[1:00:27] Viber, Facebook, what have you, Twitter,
[1:00:31] everything else. It won't be like
[1:00:33] that. And because it won't be like that,
[1:00:37] it behooves us as the bride of Jesus
[1:00:41] Christ to really be careful
[1:00:46] that we will miss
[1:00:47] it. We will miss
[1:00:51] it if we are not careful. Amen. Because
[1:00:54] our mindset of today, you can't just
[1:00:57] wake up tomorrow and say I'm going to
[1:00:59] Africa.
[1:01:01] You have to prepare for it. You have to
[1:01:02] announce it. You have to purchase your
[1:01:04] tickets. Reserve whatever hotel where
[1:01:07] you're going to be staying. If it's a
[1:01:09] wedding, you can't just wake up and say,
[1:01:11] "I'm getting married
[1:01:13] tomorrow." You You got to advertise it.
[1:01:16] You got to announce it. So, our life is
[1:01:19] so set in a way of announcement,
[1:01:22] bulletin, advertise it. And yet, the
[1:01:25] coming of the Lord is not like that.
[1:01:28] Amen. Which means we have to take heed
[1:01:32] and we must be very very careful that we
[1:01:36] will miss it.
[1:01:38] Unless we are really watching and
[1:01:41] expecting and know what we are looking
[1:01:44] for. Amen. We will miss it. Amen.
[1:01:50] Now the thought here as I said is the
[1:01:53] secret sudden coming of the
[1:01:58] Lord. One place it says it comes like
[1:02:01] travail upon a woman.
[1:02:05] Now of course today's technology can be
[1:02:09] more precise on when baby is coming if
[1:02:13] if a woman is expecting and all that you
[1:02:16] know but still the very moment and the
[1:02:19] very minute that that that that
[1:02:22] that just
[1:02:25] comes that just comes but at least the
[1:02:30] woman will know that it is coming. There
[1:02:34] will be signs and they go
[1:02:37] stronger and and more violent and and
[1:02:40] and and then she knows and I believe as
[1:02:44] the bride we can see that the birth
[1:02:47] painans of a new earth, a new heaven and
[1:02:52] the new
[1:02:54] Jerusalem, the birth painans of a
[1:02:56] rapture are becoming more violent
[1:03:00] than before. Amen. And it should make us
[1:03:04] to fall down on our knees and say, "Lord
[1:03:07] have mercy."
[1:03:08] Amen. Lord have mercy. The things that
[1:03:11] we are seeing, the falling apart of the
[1:03:13] world, the changes that we are seeing
[1:03:16] right now in
[1:03:19] the in the world events. Amen. Name it.
[1:03:24] The trade things are changing swiftly.
[1:03:28] The wars and rumors of war, it's
[1:03:31] changing. so rapidly that we who are the
[1:03:34] bride of Jesus Christ must be ready.
[1:03:38] Amen. We got to be ready. Amen. And I
[1:03:41] mean it from the bottom of my heart. We
[1:03:43] got to be ready. Amen. We used to talk a
[1:03:46] lot about the rapture, the translation,
[1:03:49] the new Jerusalem. We used to sing a lot
[1:03:51] of songs about his coming and how the
[1:03:56] time was fast span and how we got to be
[1:04:00] ready and got to have oil in the lambs
[1:04:03] and we'll sing those songs. Give me oil
[1:04:05] in my lamb. Keep me
[1:04:08] burning. Give me oil in my lamb. I
[1:04:12] pray. Give me oil in my lamb. Keep me
[1:04:16] burning. keep me burning till the end of
[1:04:20] day. We used to sing those and we would
[1:04:23] sing them so enthusiastically and and we
[1:04:27] were just thinking he's coming next week
[1:04:29] or he's coming this year. But then
[1:04:31] because the time has prolonged
[1:04:38] because the Lord has lingered in his
[1:04:41] coming, some are now beginning to doubt.
[1:04:45] Amen. Even the message that God has sent
[1:04:48] in this generation to call out a bride.
[1:04:51] Some are beginning to doubt that there
[1:04:55] really is going to be a rapture. And the
[1:04:58] Bible says that's when it comes. Amen.
[1:05:03] That's when it comes when people are now
[1:05:06] really doubting it and some
[1:05:08] living falling away. As the Bible says,
[1:05:11] there will be a falling away. Many will
[1:05:14] fall away and and and and scoffers will
[1:05:17] rise. We read that in Peter. Scoffers
[1:05:19] will rise and they will say, "Wasn't
[1:05:22] there supposed to be a rapture? Wasn't
[1:05:24] Los Angeles supposed to sink? Wasn't
[1:05:26] this supposed to happen? Where is that?
[1:05:28] And where is this?" And then Peter says
[1:05:31] this, they are ignorant of the fact that
[1:05:35] God is not slack
[1:05:38] concerning his promises. He's not slack.
[1:05:42] Amen. But he's longsuffering.
[1:05:45] That we all may come to repentance.
[1:05:50] He He is coming for us.
[1:05:54] He wants to take us.
[1:05:57] So he's not going to come until you and
[1:06:01] me are ready. Amen.
[1:06:06] May God make us ready.
[1:06:08] May God make our children ready. Amen.
[1:06:12] May God make the bride members ready.
[1:06:17] So that he will come. But I want to be
[1:06:20] in a position where I can say even so
[1:06:26] come Lord Jesus. Regardless of the
[1:06:29] condition of the neighbor, regardless of
[1:06:32] the condition of my friend, regardless
[1:06:34] of the condition of the church at large,
[1:06:37] regardless of the condition of other
[1:06:39] members of the bride, I want to raise up
[1:06:42] my hand and say, "Even so, come Lord
[1:06:45] Jesus."
[1:06:50] Even so,
[1:06:52] come Lord Jesus. If I'm trying to build
[1:06:56] a home and I and I'm not yet finished, I
[1:07:01] still want to say even so come Lord
[1:07:04] Jesus. If we are in a church building
[1:07:08] project and we haven't finished it, we
[1:07:12] are expecting to do so. We are looking
[1:07:14] forward to using the new church. I don't
[1:07:17] want that to stand in my way.
[1:07:20] I don't want nothing between me and the
[1:07:23] savior. I don't want no program. I don't
[1:07:27] want no project. I don't know. I I I I
[1:07:30] want nothing between me and the savior.
[1:07:35] Help me Lord Jesus.
[1:07:37] Whatever I am doing, let me doing it
[1:07:40] knowing I'm waiting for the coming of
[1:07:43] the Lord.
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:47] I'm waiting for his coming. If I'm
[1:07:50] building a church, I will build with one
[1:07:52] hand. And still I'm praying. I'm
[1:07:55] building with one hand and I'm still
[1:07:57] preparing. I'm building on the other
[1:08:00] hand. And I'm still trying to get the
[1:08:02] last one in. I'm building on one hand
[1:08:05] and I'm still worshiping God. I'm still
[1:08:08] I'm still loving him so much.
[1:08:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:08:16] Amen. The major events are well
[1:08:19] announced and published, but the coming
[1:08:22] of the Lord, he comes as a thief. Isn't
[1:08:25] this amazing that the events that really
[1:08:29] don't matter are the ones that are being
[1:08:33] advertised,
[1:08:35] things of this life, conferences and and
[1:08:38] and and all these other things that
[1:08:41] really don't matter. You can miss a
[1:08:43] wedding of a friend. You can miss a
[1:08:46] wedding of a brother and a sister. But
[1:08:49] you must not miss the coming of the
[1:08:52] Lord. Amen. Things that don't matter,
[1:08:55] they are the ones that are being
[1:08:57] advertised. And yet the thing that
[1:09:00] matters most is being
[1:09:03] advertised but secretly. Amen. Secretly.
[1:09:08] Yes. See, when a thief is coming, if a
[1:09:10] thief is coming around this property
[1:09:13] here, he doesn't make himself known
[1:09:17] openly, but he also doesn't just come to
[1:09:22] strike. He makes his
[1:09:25] investigations. The thief has to find
[1:09:27] out, is there somebody who is guarding
[1:09:31] the place? Do they have some
[1:09:34] security? Are the doors always locked?
[1:09:38] Do they have flood lights that will
[1:09:41] expose me? He makes his investigations
[1:09:44] first to find out how best he may strike
[1:09:48] that property and break in. And I
[1:09:51] believe investigations are going on
[1:09:53] right now. And a major investigation has
[1:09:56] already gone on. God sending out a
[1:09:59] message to call out the bride. And as
[1:10:02] the ministers are proclaiming that
[1:10:04] message and preaching it and and and and
[1:10:07] and looking and hunting for that last
[1:10:10] one, that investigation is going on
[1:10:13] tonight.
[1:10:20] I want you to notice that the
[1:10:23] announcement is also
[1:10:26] secret because it's a secret sudden
[1:10:29] coming.
[1:10:30] He comes as a thief. Behold, I come as a
[1:10:34] thief. So that announcement is secret.
[1:10:37] The investigation is secret. The
[1:10:40] announcement is
[1:10:42] secret. And I want to say this, the
[1:10:45] parable of the 10 virgins clearly show
[1:10:50] this. The announcement was given to all
[1:10:54] the 10 virgins, but not all of those 10
[1:10:59] virgins went with him when he came. Only
[1:11:04] the wise virgins who had oil in their
[1:11:08] lambs, they had oil in their vessels,
[1:11:12] they are the ones who went with the
[1:11:14] bridegroom to the wedding. Amen. And I
[1:11:18] want you to know, don't just rest
[1:11:20] because you are a member of the church.
[1:11:23] Don't just be satisfied because you are
[1:11:26] a believer. Don't just be satisfied
[1:11:29] because you are in the church. You are
[1:11:31] part of the bride. Don't just be
[1:11:34] satisfied because you have accepted the
[1:11:37] message of his second coming. Don't just
[1:11:39] be satisfied because you believe that we
[1:11:42] are in the end times. You believe that
[1:11:44] Christ is coming back. But you got to
[1:11:46] have oil in your lamp.
[1:11:51] Amen.
[1:11:53] Jesus. In Matthew chap 25:10. And while
[1:11:57] they went to buy, the bridegroom came,
[1:12:02] and they that were ready went in with
[1:12:05] him to the marriage, and the door was
[1:12:08] shut. That's the sad part. The door was
[1:12:13] shut. Once the door is shut then you
[1:12:15] cannot come in because he says I am he
[1:12:18] who opens and no man can shut and if I
[1:12:22] shut no man can open it. Amen. When once
[1:12:26] the door was shut on the ark in the days
[1:12:30] of
[1:12:31] Noah nobody else could enter. God shut
[1:12:36] Noah in and the animals and the rest
[1:12:40] perished. So will it be at this time
[1:12:43] here, behold, I come as a thief. And
[1:12:46] when he shuts the door, then the remnant
[1:12:50] goes through the tribulation period. And
[1:12:52] that's not a good thing to ever even
[1:12:54] think or imagine. Are you ready?
[1:12:59] Amen. Are you ready? He says, "Behold, I
[1:13:03] come as a thief in the night." Are you
[1:13:06] ready to meet him? I'm not talking
[1:13:08] about, "Have you been baptized?" It's
[1:13:11] good to be baptized. You must be
[1:13:13] baptized. But we need to live a higher
[1:13:16] life than just being baptized.
[1:13:19] You need a better confession than just
[1:13:22] say, "I am a member of the bride of
[1:13:25] Jesus Christ." You got to be ready.
[1:13:30] Only they that were ready went in with
[1:13:32] the bridegroom. It is not everyone who
[1:13:35] claims to be in the message of this end
[1:13:38] time or to be in the bride of the Lord
[1:13:41] Jesus Christ that will go with the
[1:13:44] bridegroom to the marriage. Only they
[1:13:48] that were ready. Amen. And I keep asking
[1:13:51] you, are you ready? Amen. Are your
[1:13:55] garments white? Amen. Are they spotless?
[1:14:00] Amen.
[1:14:01] Yes, Lord. Glory to Jesus. Have you been
[1:14:04] to the blood? Amen. Have you been washed
[1:14:08] in the blood? Amen. Are your garments
[1:14:11] spotless? Amen. They've got to be
[1:14:14] spotless. Amen. Jesus said in Matthew 7,
[1:14:18] "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord,
[1:14:21] Lord," shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:14:25] heaven, but he that doeth the will of my
[1:14:28] father which is in heaven. And many will
[1:14:31] say to me, in that day, Lord, have we
[1:14:33] not prophesied in your name? And in your
[1:14:35] name have cast out devils, and in your
[1:14:37] name have done many wonderful works, and
[1:14:39] I will profess unto them, I never knew
[1:14:43] you, depart from me, you that work
[1:14:47] iniquity.
[1:14:49] In another parable of the marriage
[1:14:52] feast, Jesus said in Matthew
[1:14:56] 22 11, "And when the king came into to
[1:15:00] see the guest, he saw there a man which
[1:15:03] had not on a wedding
[1:15:08] garment." And he said unto him,
[1:15:11] "Friend, how camest thou in he not
[1:15:15] having a wedding garment?" and he was
[1:15:19] speechless. I don't want to be
[1:15:21] speechless on that day. I want my ticket
[1:15:25] in my hand.
[1:15:27] I want my
[1:15:28] confession solid and sure that I know
[1:15:32] him in the power of his resurrection.
[1:15:36] I want to be able to know that I am
[1:15:39] redeemed.
[1:15:41] My sins were washed away. He filled me
[1:15:44] with the Holy Ghost and he turned me
[1:15:47] around and I'm on my way to glory land.
[1:15:52] I want to be able to give an answer that
[1:15:55] Jesus is my Lord. Jesus is my savior.
[1:15:59] Jesus is my coming husband. He is my
[1:16:01] coming king. He is my bridegroom.
[1:16:05] He's the alpha and the omega, the
[1:16:08] beginning and the end. Yes. I want my
[1:16:12] confession clear. I don't want no doubt
[1:16:15] about that. I want to be able to answer
[1:16:19] when he calls me. And I say, "Hear my
[1:16:22] Lord. Speak Lord, your servant hears.
[1:16:27] Speak my Lord. Your servant is hearing.
[1:16:31] Call my Lord. Your servant will answer."
[1:16:34] Amen. When he calls for me, I want to be
[1:16:38] able to answer and say, "Here am I."
[1:16:42] Take me home, Lord.
[1:16:45] Even so, come Lord Jesus.
[1:16:50] This person who came in was addressed to
[1:16:54] as friend. He was not an enemy. He was a
[1:16:58] friend.
[1:17:00] How camest thou in friend was a friend?
[1:17:05] Someone who was in the church. Someone
[1:17:08] who was a member of the
[1:17:11] bride. A member of the believers. A
[1:17:14] member of those that claimed to be
[1:17:19] virgins. Yes, they were all virgins.
[1:17:22] They all lived a clean life. They were
[1:17:25] all sanctified. They all lived
[1:17:29] holy, but the wise took oil in their
[1:17:34] vessels with their lamb.
[1:17:40] How camest thou in hither friend not
[1:17:44] having a wedding garment? How could
[1:17:48] Queen
[1:17:50] Esther before she was Queen Esther when
[1:17:54] the king was looking for a replacement
[1:17:57] to Queen
[1:17:59] Vashi? How could she just come in her
[1:18:04] own
[1:18:05] garments? That would be rejected.
[1:18:10] How could
[1:18:11] Rebecca go to meet Isaac in her own
[1:18:17] garment, in her own apparel that would
[1:18:21] be
[1:18:23] rejected. Ela, the servant of Abraham,
[1:18:27] brought apparel, gold, silver, name it.
[1:18:32] And when Rebecca went to meet Isaac, she
[1:18:36] was putting on what came from Isaac. And
[1:18:40] when Isaac saw Rebecca putting on the
[1:18:43] very same garment that Isaac had sent,
[1:18:47] Isaac was enthused and he received
[1:18:51] Rebecca.
[1:18:54] Esther was given
[1:18:56] purification by Hagi the seventh uh
[1:19:00] chamberlain there. The wise men there,
[1:19:02] he told her how to prepare herself, how
[1:19:06] to present herself. And she was accepted
[1:19:09] because she did not want anything else
[1:19:12] for her purification except what that
[1:19:15] man gave from the king. And remember
[1:19:19] when when when
[1:19:22] uh Hmon, wicked
[1:19:25] Hmon, wanted to kill all the Hebrews
[1:19:29] there and and Esther said, "If I perish,
[1:19:36] let me perish. I'm going to see the king
[1:19:40] and plead for my people." Amen. She
[1:19:44] said, "I don't I don't know what it will
[1:19:46] be, but you people pray for me. I'm
[1:19:49] going to be fasting 3 days. I'm not
[1:19:52] going to eat nothing. I'm going to be
[1:19:54] praying and I'm going to approach that
[1:19:57] king that he might spare my people."
[1:20:00] When that third day came, Esther did not
[1:20:04] put on her apparel. She did not put on
[1:20:08] her garment. These people who came to
[1:20:11] the wedding feast, they came in their
[1:20:14] own garments. They came in their own
[1:20:17] clothes. They came in their own apperal.
[1:20:20] They came in their own dresses and their
[1:20:22] own suits. But there was a porter on the
[1:20:25] gate who had wedding
[1:20:27] garments from the
[1:20:31] married the father of the of of a of the
[1:20:35] of the son who was to get married. And
[1:20:37] everyone as he came was handed a robe, a
[1:20:41] wedding garment. Another one a wedding
[1:20:44] garment. Another the So when they went
[1:20:46] inside they they were all the same.
[1:20:50] There was no big me and little you and
[1:20:54] welldressed me and and and and and you
[1:20:57] don't know what dress to put on on
[1:20:59] weddings. Look at me. I am the real
[1:21:02] person. There was nothing like that
[1:21:04] because they were all given the same
[1:21:08] role. Amen. And the Holy Ghost is the
[1:21:13] one spirit by which we are all baptized
[1:21:18] into the body of Jesus Christ. And when
[1:21:21] you receive the Holy Ghost, I receive
[1:21:23] the Holy Ghost. There is no big me and
[1:21:26] little you. We become one in Christ
[1:21:29] Jesus. That's your wedding garment.
[1:21:32] Amen.
[1:21:35] Isn't he wonderful?
[1:21:38] Esther when she went to meet the
[1:21:41] king, she took her royal
[1:21:45] crown. She had been given that by the
[1:21:48] king. When the king made her queen to
[1:21:52] replace Vashi, the king gave Esther a
[1:21:57] royal crown and a royal robe. So when
[1:22:01] she wanted to go and see the king, she
[1:22:03] put on the garment that had come from
[1:22:06] the king and the crown that had come
[1:22:10] from the king. And when the king saw
[1:22:13] that, he handed to her scepter and said,
[1:22:17] "Quinn Esther, what is it that you want?
[1:22:21] Even to the house of my kingdom, it will
[1:22:24] be given to you." And when Jesus sees
[1:22:27] the word that he sent and you are
[1:22:32] clothed in that word, in that doctrine,
[1:22:35] he will receive you in the word in Mary.
[1:22:39] Amen.
[1:22:43] Friend, how did you come in? The Bible
[1:22:46] goes on to say on verse 13, Matthew 22,
[1:22:49] the king said to the servants, "Bind him
[1:22:53] hand and foot and take him away. Cast
[1:22:55] him into outer darkness. There shall be
[1:22:58] weeping and nashing of teeth, for many
[1:23:00] are called, but
[1:23:03] few are chosen." So I want to say this
[1:23:06] loud and clear. The announcement is to
[1:23:09] all
[1:23:10] members of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:14] But only the true
[1:23:16] bride that has got oil in their vessels
[1:23:21] will go with
[1:23:23] him. Are you in that number of that
[1:23:26] church
[1:23:28] triumphant? I want to be in that number
[1:23:31] of the church triumphant. Are you one of
[1:23:34] them tonight, my Christian friend? Amen.
[1:23:37] Have you been to Jesus?
[1:23:40] For a cleansing flow. Are you washed in
[1:23:43] the blood of the lamb?
[1:23:46] I want to be one of them. I want to be
[1:23:50] one of them. Amen. Yes, Lord. Don't
[1:23:53] leave me, Jesus. Amen. Is my prayer
[1:23:56] tonight. Don't leave me, Jesus. Is my
[1:23:59] plea tonight. I want to make it. All
[1:24:04] that's upon my heart and my mind is that
[1:24:07] I can make it for the rapture.
[1:24:10] I just want to make it through. I just
[1:24:13] want to hit the finishing line. I just
[1:24:16] want to take the prize of immortality,
[1:24:20] the crown of life.
[1:24:26] Amen.
[1:24:28] Amen.
[1:24:29] Matthew 25 says on verse 6, "And at
[1:24:32] midnight there was a cry made,
[1:24:37] behold, the bridegroom
[1:24:40] cometh. Go ye
[1:24:43] out. Go ye out to meet
[1:24:47] him." There is the secret announcement
[1:24:50] of the secret thief coming of the Lord.
[1:24:55] a secret announcement of the secret
[1:24:57] thief coming of the Lord Jesus. That
[1:25:01] secret announcement of that secret thief
[1:25:04] coming is going on right now.
[1:25:09] That's what I'm doing as I stand before
[1:25:11] you.
[1:25:13] He's coming soon.
[1:25:16] Behold, he comes in the clouds.
[1:25:19] He's coming soon and very soon. Soon and
[1:25:23] very soon, we are going to meet the
[1:25:26] Lord. Every service that you hear with
[1:25:30] the revelation of this end time that we
[1:25:32] have is an announcement going on. Amen.
[1:25:36] It's an announcement from the messenger
[1:25:39] to the ministers now who are carrying
[1:25:41] that same announcement. Amen. Behold, I
[1:25:45] come as a thief in the night.
[1:25:50] There is the circuit
[1:25:52] announcement secret thief and the thief
[1:25:56] coming of the
[1:25:58] Lord. The bridegroom cometh. What is it?
[1:26:03] Malachi chapter 4:5.
[1:26:05] Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:26:09] before the coming of the great and
[1:26:12] dreadful day of the Lord. Why is God
[1:26:15] sending that prophet? Why is God sending
[1:26:18] that
[1:26:20] anointing to announce
[1:26:23] secretly
[1:26:25] not publicly?
[1:26:27] It won't be accepted. Amen. In the
[1:26:30] organizational systems, it won't be
[1:26:33] accepted in the worldly systems. It
[1:26:36] won't be accepted in the theological
[1:26:39] colleges. Amen. But the announcement is
[1:26:41] going on all the same. Behold, I send
[1:26:45] you Elijah the prophet. Amen.
[1:26:48] The secret announcement,
[1:26:51] Amen. of his first coming was made by
[1:26:55] John the Baptist. Amen. And it wasn't
[1:26:58] what the people thought it would be.
[1:27:01] Coming out from Jerusalem and in the
[1:27:05] papers and everywhere. It was out in the
[1:27:11] desert
[1:27:12] secretly out on the River Jordan.
[1:27:16] secretly the voice of one crying out in
[1:27:21] the wilderness, "Prepare ye the way of
[1:27:25] the Lord." Amen. It wasn't as public as
[1:27:28] you will ever think it was. Those that
[1:27:31] cared to hear had to come down from
[1:27:35] Jerusalem, come down from their high
[1:27:39] places, and come down from their
[1:27:41] positions of what they thought they
[1:27:43] knew. They had to come down, humble
[1:27:47] themselves, go to the river Jordan out
[1:27:50] in the desert to hear an
[1:27:53] announcement of such an important person
[1:27:56] coming, the son of the living God, God
[1:28:00] in flesh, Emmanuel,
[1:28:03] the prince of peace, the virginborn baby
[1:28:06] of
[1:28:07] Mary coming, being announced by a man
[1:28:13] who never went to a seminary college or
[1:28:17] to a theological college. A man who went
[1:28:21] out into the wilderness at 9 years old
[1:28:24] and a religious fanatic or crank as the
[1:28:29] modern world would class John. He was
[1:28:31] nothing but a fanatic, but he was
[1:28:34] secretly
[1:28:37] announcing the first coming of Jesus
[1:28:39] Christ. Amen. And how many were ready
[1:28:42] for his coming? Just a handful.
[1:28:46] You can count them on your two hands.
[1:28:50] How many were ready for him when he
[1:28:52] came? They missed him. They missed his
[1:28:56] birth until God had to work with
[1:29:00] some wise men from the east to let them
[1:29:04] see this
[1:29:06] star coming out of David out of Jesse.
[1:29:11] And they followed that star till they
[1:29:13] came to Jerusalem. The star went
[1:29:16] out at the headquarters of their
[1:29:19] religion. the star went out and they
[1:29:22] began to ask where is he born king of
[1:29:26] the Jews and that's when the church
[1:29:29] began to kind like wake up a bit and
[1:29:32] Herod demanded from those Pharisees and
[1:29:36] the priests and the Sadducees and them
[1:29:39] he demanded according to your law where
[1:29:42] is Messiah supposed to be born and they
[1:29:45] had to search there urgently because
[1:29:47] they were under threat from Herod And
[1:29:49] they found out it's written Bethlehem of
[1:29:53] Judea. So they told the wise men it's in
[1:29:55] Bethlehem. And Herod says if you see
[1:29:58] that child please give me word so I can
[1:30:00] worship him too. Though he wanted to
[1:30:02] kill him.
[1:30:05] But he could not be destroyed. Amen. He
[1:30:09] had a purpose to fulfill. They killed
[1:30:12] all the children from 2 years and under
[1:30:16] but they did not get Jesus.
[1:30:19] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:30:22] They killed all the maleborn children in
[1:30:26] the days of Pharaoh
[1:30:29] looking for Moses, but they did not get
[1:30:33] Moses.
[1:30:35] The fairy furnace could not destroy
[1:30:37] Shadrach, Mishik, and Abednego. And the
[1:30:40] den of lions could not destroy Daniel.
[1:30:44] God promised, "I will be with you. Amen.
[1:30:49] Nothing will hurt you. When you pass
[1:30:52] through the fire, I will be with you.
[1:30:55] When you pass through the waters, I will
[1:30:58] be with you. And Jesus says, I will be
[1:31:01] with you to the end. And even tonight,
[1:31:05] even right there where you are, you
[1:31:07] might be having a lot of problems. You
[1:31:10] might be having a lot of affliction, but
[1:31:13] God will bring you out.
[1:31:16] Many are the afflictions of the
[1:31:18] righteous. Many are the troubles of the
[1:31:21] righteous. But the Lord delivers him
[1:31:24] from all of them. You are coming out of
[1:31:26] it. Someone shout hallelujah. You are
[1:31:29] coming out. You are coming out of your
[1:31:31] trouble. You are coming out of your
[1:31:33] sickness. You are coming out. You are
[1:31:35] coming out of that cancer. You are
[1:31:37] coming out. You are coming out of that
[1:31:39] high blood pressure. You are coming out
[1:31:42] of it. You are coming out of it. Yes,
[1:31:45] you're coming out of it. You are going
[1:31:46] to be healed. You are not going to die.
[1:31:49] You are going to
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:31:53] live. My Lord and my God. You are going
[1:31:56] to live. You are not going to die. And I
[1:31:59] want you to know tonight God is on your
[1:32:03] side. And if God before you, who can be
[1:32:08] against you?
[1:32:10] Nobody. I say nobody.
[1:32:14] If the Holy Ghost is standing with you
[1:32:17] and standing for you, no
[1:32:20] weapon, no weapon that is formed against
[1:32:24] you will ever prosper. Go ahead and
[1:32:27] rejoice. Go ahead and praise God. Go
[1:32:31] ahead and thank God. You will make it.
[1:32:35] You will be healed. You will overcome.
[1:32:41] Your desire will be granted.
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:47] Hallelujah.
[1:32:49] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:32:52] This is beautiful here.
[1:32:55] When Esther
[1:32:57] went to meet the king. She remembered to
[1:33:01] put on the royal opera that had come
[1:33:05] from the king. the royal crown that had
[1:33:09] come from the king. And she said, "If I
[1:33:11] perish, let me perish." But I am dressed
[1:33:16] in his garments.
[1:33:19] I am putting on his garment. I am
[1:33:22] putting on the crown that he gave me.
[1:33:25] Amen. And when she stood there and the
[1:33:30] king saw his material, Amen.
[1:33:34] perfectly fitting on Esther. The king
[1:33:38] said, "I'll give you half half of my
[1:33:42] kingdom."
[1:33:43] Ask anything, I'll give it to you. And
[1:33:46] when Jesus, King Jesus, when he sees you
[1:33:51] clothed in the garment of his word,
[1:33:55] believing his word, believe his
[1:33:59] promises, he will recognize his word in
[1:34:03] you.
[1:34:04] Hallelujah.
[1:34:06] And he will grant you your heart's
[1:34:08] desire.
[1:34:10] Can someone say amen to? Oh yes, Siri.
[1:34:16] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I feel
[1:34:18] good right now.
[1:34:20] I feel very good really. I really I
[1:34:23] thank God for his word. I thank God.
[1:34:26] Jesus says if you abide in me and my
[1:34:30] word abide in you, you shall ask
[1:34:33] anything, it will be done unto you. He
[1:34:36] says, "As the branch cannot do anything
[1:34:39] if it's not connected to the vine,
[1:34:42] neither can you do anything without me."
[1:34:46] He says, "Without me, you can do
[1:34:48] nothing. But if you abide in me and my
[1:34:51] word abides in you, you will ask
[1:34:53] whatever you want. It will be done unto
[1:34:56] you."
[1:34:58] Amen.
[1:35:02] Here is the announcement. secretly. It's
[1:35:05] not going to be broadcast on every
[1:35:07] television
[1:35:09] uh program and be broadcast and and and
[1:35:11] and you know all the big mainline
[1:35:14] churches accepting it. No,
[1:35:18] no, it will be evil spoken of. It will
[1:35:23] be despised. Amen. It will be looked
[1:35:27] down upon.
[1:35:29] It will be sidelined.
[1:35:32] It will be like a non-event.
[1:35:36] The coming of John the Baptist was such
[1:35:38] a great thing. When you read in the
[1:35:41] Bible here, it says, you know, the high
[1:35:43] places will be brought down low. When
[1:35:46] you read that, you want to see something
[1:35:50] very high coming down and you won't see
[1:35:53] it.
[1:35:55] But the high places were brought down
[1:35:57] low when those Pharisees came down and
[1:36:00] said, "What can we do?" The soldiers and
[1:36:03] them asking John, "What can we do?" And
[1:36:05] John says,
[1:36:07] "Well, you must bring
[1:36:10] fruit, meet unto repentance." That's
[1:36:13] what he told
[1:36:15] them. That's what he told them. What is
[1:36:18] the
[1:36:18] announcement secretly? Behold, I will
[1:36:21] send you Elijah.
[1:36:23] He's not going to go on every radio
[1:36:26] broadcast. He's not going to be on the
[1:36:29] front page of the newspapers. He's not
[1:36:32] going to be accepted in the theological
[1:36:34] colleges. It's a
[1:36:36] secret announcement.
[1:36:42] Matthew 17. And Jesus answered on verse
[1:36:45] 11 and said unto them, Elias truly shall
[1:36:48] first come and restore all things, but
[1:36:51] it's done secretly
[1:36:54] until it goes by and nobody knows it has
[1:36:58] been done. That's right. Now God has a
[1:37:01] way of doing things and he will never
[1:37:04] change it. In John chapter 14 on verse
[1:37:06] 4, Jesus answering Philillip or Thomas
[1:37:09] who said uh show us the way or something
[1:37:12] like Jesus before Thomas answered he's
[1:37:14] talking about I go prepare a place for
[1:37:16] you so where I am you may also be there.
[1:37:20] Then he says and wheither I go you know
[1:37:25] and the way you know. Come on. I like
[1:37:29] that. Amen. You know where I'm going.
[1:37:31] I'm not going I'm not going to
[1:37:33] Jerusalem. I'm I'm not going to Cairo,
[1:37:35] Egypt. I'm going to heaven. I came from
[1:37:38] God. I go back to God. You know where
[1:37:42] I'm going. I go where I came from. And
[1:37:44] you know, saints, you go where you came
[1:37:46] from. If you were in the mind of God,
[1:37:49] you are going right back there. If you
[1:37:52] were with him before the foundation of
[1:37:54] the world, you are going right back
[1:37:56] there. Jesus says, I go, you know where
[1:38:00] I'm going. I'm not going to hell. I'm
[1:38:02] going to heaven. I'm not going to
[1:38:04] Jerusalem. I am going to heaven. You
[1:38:06] know where I am going. And the way
[1:38:10] you know. But if you read on further, he
[1:38:12] says, I am the way. Amen. Amen. I am the
[1:38:17] way. He says, "And without me, no man
[1:38:21] can come to the father." That's where he
[1:38:23] was going to the father. You want to go
[1:38:25] to the father, you go by Jesus Christ
[1:38:28] because Jesus Christ was
[1:38:30] Emmanuel, God in flesh.
[1:38:34] Amen. He who was above
[1:38:38] now came to dwell with. Amen. And after
[1:38:41] a while, he came to dwell in
[1:38:46] by the baptism of his spirit. Amen.
[1:38:50] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So he
[1:38:52] says whether I go you know and the way
[1:38:55] you know God has got a way of doing his
[1:39:00] things he never changes his way and
[1:39:03] that's why we miss him because we want
[1:39:05] him to do something new which suits our
[1:39:09] modernday society. How did he announce
[1:39:12] the coming of Jesus when John the
[1:39:14] Baptist was here? Was it in every
[1:39:17] cathedral? Was it in every big place out
[1:39:21] in the desert? Amen. Nobody ever knew
[1:39:26] that something was going on down there.
[1:39:28] Amen. But it was going on all the same.
[1:39:31] Amen. The fact that people don't really
[1:39:33] know what's going on doesn't mean
[1:39:34] there's nothing going on. And the fact
[1:39:37] that you don't see nothing going on
[1:39:38] doesn't mean there's nothing going on.
[1:39:40] You don't see nothing. But I see
[1:39:42] something. Those who believe are seeing
[1:39:44] something. Those who are expecting,
[1:39:47] those who are waiting, those who love
[1:39:50] his appearing are already feeling the
[1:39:52] change inside of them.
[1:39:56] Glory to God. Those that believe
[1:40:00] are ready. They're getting ready every
[1:40:02] day. So he was revealing, he was
[1:40:06] unveiling the secret coming, announcing
[1:40:10] it, and they never saw it.
[1:40:14] They never s until the disciples came.
[1:40:17] Wasn't Elias supposed to come? He says
[1:40:20] he's come and gone. He's come and gone.
[1:40:24] You never saw him. You never realized
[1:40:27] because your mindset
[1:40:30] is I didn't get the wedding bell. There
[1:40:32] were no wedding bell for no wedding
[1:40:34] bells for this wedding in here. So how
[1:40:36] can it be? That's not the way his coming
[1:40:38] will be announced. Amen. It's announced
[1:40:41] secretly. Amen.
[1:40:43] It's announced in a despised way. Amen.
[1:40:47] It's announced in a very unpopular way.
[1:40:50] Amen. In a way that the rest of the
[1:40:53] world doesn't want, but he announces it
[1:40:57] anyhow.
[1:40:58] Amen. What is the way? You know where
[1:41:02] I'm going and you know the way. So what
[1:41:04] is the way? If God has to announce,
[1:41:07] behold the bridegroom cometh. Yeah. Go
[1:41:12] out to meet him. That's a proclamation.
[1:41:16] That's an announcement. How does God do
[1:41:18] it? Well, this is not the first coming
[1:41:20] here that we are looking for. It's not
[1:41:23] the first coming. This is the second
[1:41:25] coming. So, there's been another coming.
[1:41:28] How was it announced? The John Baptist
[1:41:33] way. It was not a public
[1:41:37] announcement. Here is the way. Amos
[1:41:40] 3:7, Surely the Lord God will do
[1:41:47] nothing, but he reveals his secret unto
[1:41:51] his servants, the prophets. So when God
[1:41:54] revealed to the prophet, he's announcing
[1:41:59] now that's up to you now to to to find
[1:42:02] out who has made the announcement or who
[1:42:05] is making the announcement. But God will
[1:42:08] not leave that way. Amen. He will do
[1:42:11] nothing. But he reveals his secrets to
[1:42:14] his servants, the prophets. He sends
[1:42:17] them out. Amen. And he sends them out
[1:42:19] early. Amen. He sent
[1:42:21] Jeremiah. Send him out early. He sent
[1:42:25] Isaiah. Send him out early. He sent
[1:42:28] Noah. Send him out early. He sent Moses.
[1:42:32] Send him out early to
[1:42:35] announce Oh yes, he's coming.
[1:42:40] He never leaves that way. Surely the
[1:42:44] Lord God will do nothing but he reveals
[1:42:48] his secret
[1:42:50] and to his servants the prophets. So we
[1:42:54] all can agree he's coming secretly
[1:42:56] because he says I come as a thief. So
[1:42:59] his secret coming will be announced
[1:43:03] secretly by that channel of Amos 3:7.
[1:43:08] Amen. Amen. He never live. You know the
[1:43:11] way. Jesus said whether I go you know
[1:43:16] and the way you know you know
[1:43:20] then it I am the way.
[1:43:24] Amen. I I like that. Whether I go, you
[1:43:27] know, and the way you know. And they're
[1:43:31] thinking, what way is it? Which way? He
[1:43:35] says, I am the
[1:43:37] way. It's not far. Jesus is the answer.
[1:43:42] Can we say amen? Jesus is the answer.
[1:43:46] Come on, put your hands together and
[1:43:48] praise God for me. Praise God for me.
[1:43:52] Hallelujah.
[1:43:54] Amen. Amen. It's it's so simple. Uhhuh.
[1:43:58] When they were scratching their heads,
[1:44:00] you know, whether I go, you know, and
[1:44:03] the way you know, and they're saying,
[1:44:05] which which is the way? How do we get to
[1:44:08] where he is going? In fact, I don't even
[1:44:11] know where he is going. Because if you
[1:44:13] read further on, Philillip said, we
[1:44:17] don't know where you're
[1:44:18] going. Then show us the way. Then Jesus
[1:44:22] answered those two questions in one
[1:44:27] answer. And he says, "Have I been so
[1:44:30] long time with you? And yet thou has not
[1:44:33] known me,
[1:44:34] Phillip?" No. Before that verse there,
[1:44:37] brother, if you're going to your sister,
[1:44:38] if you're going to uh to uh to help me
[1:44:41] there, Philillip said unto him,
[1:44:45] Lord, before that, what's what's verse
[1:44:48] six there? If you had known me, the
[1:44:50] other one before that. All right, the
[1:44:52] other one before that. You're right.
[1:44:54] Let's go to verse. Oh, yeah. There we
[1:44:55] are. Thomas said unto him, Lord, we know
[1:44:59] not whether thou
[1:45:01] goest. And how can we know the way? Two
[1:45:04] things he's asking because Christ says,
[1:45:06] "The way you know, and you know where I
[1:45:08] am going. Whether I'm going, you know,
[1:45:10] and the way you know." Thomas says, "We
[1:45:13] we know nothing of those things there.
[1:45:15] We don't know where you are going, and
[1:45:16] we don't even know the way." And Jesus
[1:45:19] says, "I am the way." So simple. Yeah.
[1:45:25] Philip thought maybe he was going to be
[1:45:27] told some complicated method of being
[1:45:30] born again and some complicated thing of
[1:45:33] how to know that you've got the Holy
[1:45:35] Ghost and maybe you did that and then
[1:45:38] you did that and then maybe No, I am the
[1:45:42] way.
[1:45:45] Jesus is the way. Amen. Allow me to say
[1:45:49] to you tonight,
[1:45:51] friends, he is coming as a thief. Amen.
[1:45:55] Are you ready?
[1:45:59] He's not going to wait any
[1:46:02] longer. He's not going to delay much
[1:46:05] longer.
[1:46:06] The signs around us
[1:46:09] are telling us, "Yes, it is.
[1:46:12] His coming draweth nigh." Amen.
[1:46:19] when he wanted to come in the days of
[1:46:22] Noah, he sent Noah to secretly announce
[1:46:27] that. And Noah says, "Let's build an ark
[1:46:30] here. It's going to rain.
[1:46:34] It's going to
[1:46:36] rain. It's going to rain."
[1:46:39] And they mocked him and they didn't want
[1:46:42] to hear him. But he had a secret
[1:46:46] announcement. It's going to
[1:46:49] rain. Please build an ark with me. I've
[1:46:53] got the
[1:46:54] measurement. And I know what type of
[1:46:56] wood you must use. Don't get that other
[1:47:00] type of wood. Don't get the pine. Don't
[1:47:03] get the cedar. You get gopher wood. And
[1:47:07] those who want to use their wisdom,
[1:47:08] they'll say, "Oh, go for wood. That's
[1:47:11] the worst wood you can ever use to make
[1:47:14] an ark. It's too
[1:47:16] soft. But God wanted that soft wood so
[1:47:20] that it could be socked in
[1:47:23] tar. Oil socked in tar. The Holy Ghost
[1:47:28] sock going in there. Close all the pores
[1:47:31] until it becomes so strong no water can
[1:47:35] penetrate. And yet it's still light.
[1:47:39] He doesn't sink.
[1:47:41] Oh, ain't God good?
[1:47:44] Ain't God good, friend? Ain't God good,
[1:47:48] friend?
[1:47:50] Noah was like a wild man screaming,
[1:47:54] "Come, let's build the ark. I have the
[1:47:56] revelation. Please, I know the
[1:47:59] measurements. I know how many stories it
[1:48:01] must be." And you know what? Nobody,
[1:48:06] nobody
[1:48:08] escaped that flood unless he came in
[1:48:11] through the door where Noah was
[1:48:14] standing. Amen.
[1:48:17] And say, "Yes, there's room for you.
[1:48:18] Come in." The animals, there's room for
[1:48:21] you. Come in. If any more than the
[1:48:24] number of animals tried to come in, he
[1:48:27] would say, "No, we have enough giraffes
[1:48:30] now."
[1:48:34] Amen. There's enough giraffes. Now, if
[1:48:36] maybe a
[1:48:38] dozen a dozen
[1:48:41] deers wanted also to come in, he'll just
[1:48:44] choose the first two, male and female
[1:48:46] said, "No, no,
[1:48:48] please, it's okay." And you know what
[1:48:50] they would say as they were going back?
[1:48:52] We knew there was nothing to it.
[1:48:56] Amen.
[1:48:58] Yeah. They say, "Yeah, we were just
[1:49:00] trying to to find out what was going on,
[1:49:04] but we knew there was nothing to it."
[1:49:06] And there are many people who are doing
[1:49:08] that.
[1:49:09] I knew there was nothing in that church.
[1:49:12] I was just trying to find out if I can
[1:49:14] see maybe a Christian girlfriend to
[1:49:16] marry or something like that. But I knew
[1:49:19] they they
[1:49:20] off. We could go on and on, but my time
[1:49:23] is up. Are you ready to meet him? Amen.
[1:49:28] Are you ready for the second coming?
[1:49:29] Amen.
[1:49:31] Tell me, who could ever
[1:49:35] escape the death angel in the days of
[1:49:39] Moses? Who could escape the death angel
[1:49:42] outside of the secret announcement that
[1:49:47] Moses gave? Amen. when he received that
[1:49:50] commission from the burning bush and he
[1:49:54] says, "I have seen the affliction of my
[1:49:58] people and I want you, Moses, go to
[1:50:02] Pharaoh and say, Pharaoh, let my people
[1:50:06] go." Amen. Everybody who left Egypt,
[1:50:10] everybody who escaped the death angel
[1:50:13] had to display the blood on the
[1:50:16] doorpost.
[1:50:17] According
[1:50:19] to the secret announcement that Moses
[1:50:23] made.
[1:50:26] We could go on and on, but I want you to
[1:50:28] know friends, it's not what we think.
[1:50:31] It's not going to attract everybody.
[1:50:34] This is why you find that today people
[1:50:36] are so confused. There's so much going
[1:50:39] on. So many things going on, but it's
[1:50:43] not what we think. It's a secret
[1:50:45] announcement.
[1:50:47] And you know what? Blessed are your eyes
[1:50:50] and blessed are your ears. If you can
[1:50:53] see and hear that secret announcement,
[1:50:58] you are blessed.
[1:51:01] You are blessed. If you can prepare, if
[1:51:04] you can hear that, behold the
[1:51:07] bridegroom. And that's what you all are
[1:51:09] here. Bride tabernacle.
[1:51:13] Mhm. Bride church. Amen. Uh-huh. That
[1:51:18] means you have heard.
[1:51:21] You have heard the secret announcement
[1:51:24] and you are going forth to meet the
[1:51:28] Lord. And I don't want to be a foolish
[1:51:30] virgin. I want to be wise. Give me oil
[1:51:34] in my lamb. Keep me burning, Lord. Keep
[1:51:38] me burning, Lord. Keep me burning. Oh
[1:51:42] God, take away obstructions. Take away
[1:51:46] anything that may hinder. Take away all
[1:51:49] my confusion. Lord, let me have a clear
[1:51:52] mind that he is coming. He is coming. He
[1:51:57] is coming. He's coming. And I don't want
[1:52:00] to be left behind.
[1:52:02] I don't want to be left behind. The
[1:52:05] announcement has gone forth. The
[1:52:07] announcement is going on right now. What
[1:52:09] am I doing? I'm preaching to you,
[1:52:12] reading the scriptures of the second
[1:52:14] coming. Behold, he cometh quickly. Go
[1:52:19] out to meet him.
[1:52:28] Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:30] May God help you to prepare.
[1:52:33] May God dress you up.
[1:52:36] May God shut your eyes to everything
[1:52:41] negative that's going on around you. And
[1:52:44] may God open the eyes of your
[1:52:46] understanding to know that Jesus is
[1:52:48] coming soon. He's coming soon, friend.
[1:52:52] He's coming soon. He will not delay.
[1:52:57] Just so I can finish up, I'll read this
[1:52:59] this uh this uh this scripture here in
[1:53:02] the book of Revelation chapter
[1:53:05] 2. Maybe Romans 9 as I close. Romans
[1:53:08] 9:28. Just a few of these references I
[1:53:11] have here. For he will Romans 9:8. For
[1:53:14] he will finish the work and cut it short
[1:53:18] in righteousness. Because a short work
[1:53:22] will the Lord make upon the earth. God
[1:53:26] is going to finish this work. He will
[1:53:28] also finish the work in your life.
[1:53:32] Redemption is not just for your soul and
[1:53:35] your body as well. Healing is not just
[1:53:38] for the soul but for your body as well.
[1:53:41] Revelation chapter 2 verse 5. Remember
[1:53:44] therefore from whence thou art fallen.
[1:53:46] Someone say amen. Amen.
[1:53:49] Church bride, remember therefore from
[1:53:53] whence thou art
[1:53:55] fallen. I read this with tears in my
[1:54:00] eyes. I read this with tears in my eyes.
[1:54:04] I remember from whence you are falling.
[1:54:06] When we started in this message, our
[1:54:09] hearts were on fire. We would jump. We
[1:54:12] would dance in the spirit. We would
[1:54:15] praise God. We would pray all night. We
[1:54:20] would sing with tears of joy. But now
[1:54:24] many are cooling off.
[1:54:29] Remember bright tabernacle
[1:54:32] from whence thou art fallen.
[1:54:35] Remember you believers of this end time
[1:54:39] message where you are fallen and repent
[1:54:44] and do the first works. or else I will
[1:54:47] come unto thee quickly. Amen. And will
[1:54:51] remove thy candlestick. Revelation
[1:54:55] 2:16. Repent or else I will come unto
[1:54:58] thee quickly and will fight against them
[1:55:02] with the sword of my mouth. Revelation
[1:55:06] 3:11.
[1:55:07] Behold, I come quickly. Hold fast that
[1:55:12] thou has that no man may take your
[1:55:16] crown. 1 Corinthians 15:52. It will be
[1:55:19] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye.
[1:55:24] And the living creatures in Ezekiel
[1:55:27] 1:14, they had they ran and returned as
[1:55:33] the appearance of a flash of lightning.
[1:55:36] Concerning Matthew
[1:55:38] 24 278. For as the lightning cometh out
[1:55:43] of the east shineth unto the west, so
[1:55:45] shall the coming of the son of man
[1:55:50] be. For wheresoever the carcass is,
[1:55:54] there will the eagles be gathered
[1:55:56] together. Hebrews 10:37. for yet a
[1:55:59] little while and he that shall come will
[1:56:03] come and he will
[1:56:06] not tarry. In Luke 12,
[1:56:10] let your loins be ged about. Luke 12
[1:56:14] verse 35 to 40. Let your loins be good
[1:56:17] about and your light
[1:56:20] burning and yourself like unto men that
[1:56:23] wait for their Lord when he will return
[1:56:26] from the
[1:56:27] wedding that when he cometh and knowketh
[1:56:30] they may open unto him immediately.
[1:56:34] Amen. on verse 39. And this know that if
[1:56:38] the good men of the house had known what
[1:56:40] hour the thief would come, he would have
[1:56:42] watched and not have suffered his house
[1:56:45] to be broken into. Therefore, be ready
[1:56:49] also, for the Son of Man cometh at an
[1:56:51] hour that you think not.
[1:56:58] I am watching for the coming of the glad
[1:57:02] millennial day when our blessed Lord
[1:57:06] shall come and catch his waiting bright
[1:57:09] away. Oh my heart is filled with rapture
[1:57:13] as I labor watch and pray for our Lord
[1:57:17] is coming back to earth again.
[1:57:22] Oh, our Lord is coming back to earth
[1:57:28] again. Yes, sir. He's coming back to
[1:57:32] earth again. Sing it together with me.
[1:57:35] Satan will be bound. A thousand years
[1:57:39] will have no turn. Yes. After Jesus
[1:57:43] shall come
[1:57:45] back. Jesus coming back will be the
[1:57:47] answer. Jesus coming back will be the
[1:57:51] answer to that sorrowing cry. For the
[1:57:55] knowledge of the Lord shall fill the
[1:57:58] earth and sea and sky. God of God shall
[1:58:02] take away all sickness and the suffer
[1:58:05] his will. Amen. When our Lord
[1:58:10] lifted. Everybody join. Oh, our Lord is
[1:58:15] coming
[1:58:18] back. Oh, our
[1:58:24] Lord. Oh,

[2:07:41] gone. For I have
[2:07:44] made my

[2:08:30] you. Lord
[2:08:34] Jesus, the service has come to an
[2:08:38] end. And if there is somebody without
[2:08:40] the wedding
[2:08:43] garment, I pray today that you'll be
[2:08:46] merciful. If there is somebody who
[2:08:48] doesn't know
[2:08:49] you as their personal savior, if there's
[2:08:52] somebody who hasn't received the wedding
[2:08:55] garment of the baptism of the Holy
[2:08:57] Ghost, Lord, may you touch them
[2:09:01] now. We know you said no man can come
[2:09:05] unless the father draw him. So I'm
[2:09:08] praying oh God that you draw those that
[2:09:12] you know they are your
[2:09:15] ship. Lord touch them in the name of
[2:09:18] Jesus. And even those that have already
[2:09:20] come to you but they feel they need to
[2:09:23] be
[2:09:24] ready. God I pray that you give them oil
[2:09:28] in their lamps. Give them oil in their
[2:09:31] vessels.
[2:09:33] Let them also be able to say this old
[2:09:37] world will never hold
[2:09:39] me. I have made my
[2:09:41] consecration and I have my wedding
[2:09:45] garment on. Bless them, Father. Bless
[2:09:48] those that shall
[2:09:50] be listening and those that are
[2:09:52] listening.
[2:09:54] Oh God, may you
[2:09:56] reveal yourself to each and everyone and
[2:10:00] may you make us ready for this secret
[2:10:04] coming. Yes, you have given us this
[2:10:06] secret announcement of the revelation of
[2:10:09] your word even in these last days. We
[2:10:12] ask pronouncing these blessings upon the
[2:10:15] audience. And Lord, wherever this sermon
[2:10:18] will go, let the sick be healed.

[2:10:26] their lives over to you Lord Jesus. We

[2:13:08] We get married. My wife and I, my wife
[2:13:11] is here.
[2:13:13] After one
[2:13:15] year, no pregnancy, no
[2:13:18] baby. We went to see the doctor. Doctor
[2:13:21] say everything is okay. To me, to her
[2:13:24] everything was is okay.
[2:13:27] And after second years he say he's going
[2:13:30] to try to see if her
[2:13:32] ovelation was okay was
[2:13:35] enough. Brother and sister when he check
[2:13:39] he find out the ovelation was very
[2:13:42] low. He gave a medication to make the
[2:13:45] revelation to go
[2:13:47] high. After couple of weeks we took the
[2:13:50] medication. She took it.
[2:13:53] We went back to check if the revelation
[2:13:56] was normal. Evolution was completely
[2:14:01] zero. And now the doctor say, "Mom, I
[2:14:03] never see something like that. I don't
[2:14:05] understand what's going on because
[2:14:07] evolution was three. Now it's completely
[2:14:11] zero." And he say, "Okay, let's try
[2:14:15] insemination." And I'm telling my wife
[2:14:18] stand up on his office. My wife said,
[2:14:20] "Doctor, you don't get it yet.
[2:14:23] God is telling you he don't need you to
[2:14:25] give me a
[2:14:28] baby. So you I don't go I don't I'm not
[2:14:32] going to do incimination. I'm not going
[2:14:34] to do nothing else. I'm going
[2:14:37] home. And doctor say ma'am God don't do
[2:14:40] miracle no
[2:14:42] more. He was
[2:14:45] laughing. And my wife
[2:14:47] say I I'm I'm telling you I'm going back
[2:14:50] home. You will see me here pregnant. And
[2:14:52] we went home. When we get home, we did
[2:14:56] just short prayer. We say,
[2:14:59] "God, you hear the doctor say you don't
[2:15:02] make miracle no more." So if you want
[2:15:04] the doctor to laugh after you is your
[2:15:07] problem because you see he was laughing
[2:15:10] and now we leave everything in your
[2:15:12] hand. Amen. That's it. Amen. Couple of
[2:15:16] months, couple year, couple months
[2:15:19] after she supposed to go to

[2:15:24] away and I went to work. I supposed to
[2:15:27] came back to drop her at the
[2:15:29] airport. When I came back, she was
[2:15:31] crying. I said, "Baby, don't cry here.
[2:15:34] The funeral is in Africa. Why you crying
[2:15:37] here?" Yeah, you don't need to cry in my
[2:15:40] house here
[2:15:41] because I spend enough money to pay a
[2:15:43] ticket to go to Africa. Let's when you
[2:15:45] get there, you
[2:15:48] cry. She said, "No, I I'm not. It's not
[2:15:51] because a funeral is
[2:15:53] because I don't know why. I just do the
[2:15:56] test, the pregnancy test, and it's
[2:15:58] positive."
[2:16:03] You see, and what why I say love my God,
[2:16:08] we decide to together if she's pregnant,
[2:16:10] she don't go to Africa. That's why we
[2:16:13] decide as human being because we know a
[2:16:16] little bit where the how the situation

[2:17:02] everybody supposed to be blind. We don't
[2:17:05] do that to find out who she's pregnant."
[2:17:07] And God did it.

[2:23:21] Yes, Lord. The things that are prepared.
[2:23:25] Pray God that you're blessed,
[2:23:28] sanctified in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:23:30] Yes, Lord.
[2:23:33] Father God, go with us now. Yes, Lord.
[2:23:37] And let your blood cover us.
[2:23:40] Let your angels watch over us.
[2:23:43] Keep us under the shadows of your wings.
[2:23:45] Thank you, Lord. For Lord, we thank you.
[2:23:48] Thank you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name.
[2:23:50] Amen.
[2:23:53] Don't forget next door they prepared.
[2:23:55] So, they're going to have I guess too
[2:23:58] much,
[2:23:59] but God knows.
