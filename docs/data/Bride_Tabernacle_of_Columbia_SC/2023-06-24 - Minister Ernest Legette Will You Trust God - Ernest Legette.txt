your mercy thank you for your love and kindness towards us God we love you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of First Kings by the grace of God first Kings 17. First Kings 17. we got to say man and it reads and Elijah the Tish bite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be due nor Reign these years but according to my word may God of the bless the reading of his word may be seated want to go a little further down here to we'll start here at the eighth verse and the word of the Lord came on came unto him saying arise get thee to zero seraphim which belongeth to zidan and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to Zara Zara and when he came to the gate of the city Behold a widow woman was there Gathering of stakes and he called her and said fetch me I pray be a little water in a vessel that I may drink and she was going to fetch it he called and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee and morsel of bread in thy hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go and dress it for me and my son and they and that we may eat it and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after mate for thee and for thy son and for thus saith the Lord a god of Israel the barrel of meals shall not waste neither shall the crews have all fell until the day that the Lord sinneth rain upon the Earth and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the crews have all fell according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah let me God bless the reading of his word again tonight by the grace of God just for a moment I want to I want to talk to you just for a moment just on a little something that the Lord put on my heart and I've ministered on it about a week ago but I I entitled it you know what is Faith and will you trust God Amen what is Faith and and will you trust God you know I was at thinking once the scripture came to me about casting your bread upon the Water you know in Ecclesiastes 11 and and you know he's talking about casting your bread upon the water and it'll return to you says you know when I was thinking about that and thinking about you know I was just started looking at that and just just start thinking about you know giving you know without worrying about how you're going to get it back or given without worrying about the gain you're going to get from it because you know when when you give and you can't beat God's given you know I thought about you know start thinking about some things and that's you know like I said we was looking at this and and will you trust God and what is Faith and you know I began to look at sometimes you know what faith is you know faith faith stands alone Faith stands alone by itself they don't need no no help from anybody right or faith doesn't need the five senses to see it or to uh uh feel it or any of those things because it's not governed by that realm but what faith is Faith is a revelation faith is something that God you know reveals to you by his spirit and and you know you you count it like it says Abraham believed God and he counted you know those things that were not as though they were right it was it was counted to him for righteousness he called those things as though not that we're not as though they were because Faith had revealed it to him that no matter you know and as I said it stands alone it stood alone even with what his body was saying it rejected what his body was saying it rejected you know Faith rejected what his body was saying what the situation looked like Faith rejected all of that because it didn't recognize nothing but what what the voice of God had told him you know you know the Bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word you know hearing isn't what isn't what uh makes produce I mean makes the faith but hearing it it produces you hear the word of God and then something inside of you just says I believe that you know I heard the word and and something's just just clicks in you you know that's why it's always good to read the words you know many times trials storms or something that might have come in your life and all of a sudden like we said a scripture come the word of God will come to you and then it comes so clear but what it is and then you you look at that whole situation and God gave you a scripture God gave you something to uh uh and what it did you know that it produced a faith in in you and then you said though everything else was was totally against it you know the God give you faith and your faith rejected it your faith rejected all of that and it held on to what the word of God Is So I said I said what is Faith come on so you know we're looking we're looking at a lot of things I said Faith stands alone you know it's God revealing to you you know I was thinking about you know what is Faith I said Faith looks at hopeless cases and they don't even worry about the hope faith looks at hopeless cases and it knows that what the word of God said about those hopeless cases you know I was saying that God Specializes in things that man can't do faith faith what is faith faith looks at hopeless cases Faith looks at hard situations you know they got these little videos Mission Impossible Faith looks at The Impossible don't it Faith looks Faith goes beyond you know they can only dream of fairy tale things like that but Faith brings those things to you to reality even though everything says no faith faith looks at at hopeless hard cases right Faith looks at Lazarus being dead in this great in the Tomb for four days stinking already right but what did Faith do it brought him out didn't it you know even even though when Jesus came and and they were saying he's dead and all they still had to have faith to roll away the stone didn't they come on they still had to somebody still had to go and move that stone away to just take God at his word and sometimes that's what it is I look at it I says Lord what is Faith you know what I'm gonna roll away the stone God Jesus is here see the thing is when we're looking at our own ability that's when we we the situation looks worse the situation looks hopeless the situation looks bad when we're looking at our own ability but when we get away from that when we start thinking or start looking at it as it's not my ability anyhow it ain't what I can do but it's what God can do and there's nothing there's nothing too hard for the Lord there's nothing impossible there's nothing too hard for the Lord and that's more than something that we just jump and Shout about but that's something that we look at from day to day we look at from situation to situation from trial to trial we look at that that ain't I was saying just something we shout about on Sunday morning but when we face those trials that's what we look at that God I believe that you're gonna you're gonna bring me out of this situation Lord I'm not looking at my own ability because my ability I'm already it already I can't do it already I'm I'm I can't make a way for myself I don't know already so I'm already failed uh you know looking at myself we like grasshoppers looking at ourselves it's all we already failures but what faith does we ain't looking at ourselves I couldn't save myself you couldn't save yourself but it was God that done it we look into a a what Christ did for us and that's what I'm standing firm on even here tonight that's what I'm standing firm on God it was you that saved me it was you that brought me it was you that kept me yesterday and I'm looking for you to keep me today and I'm looking for you to keep me tomorrow no matter what comes my way I didn't save myself God you saved me no matter what trial what no matter what come Faith stands alone you know David was in a rough situation one time and where their wives got taken and everybody was upset and they were talked about even stoning them but what he did the Bible I like how the Bible says but he encouraged himself in the Lord come on if nobody else ain't gonna go I'mma inquire of the Lord and if he tell me to go if nobody else don't go if God told me to go you know I like that about David he always brought the uniform and all that in in front of eford and all he would always inquire Lord should we go up and that's what he based it so if the Lord said go up you're going to Prevail then nothing couldn't stop him half of the army could have stayed behind but David was gonna go because God told him he said without surely without fail you're gonna you're gonna overcome on but if God told him don't go he didn't go but what it is no matter what you know when God says yes when when God gives you the okay or when God speaks nothing can't stop that nothing is nothing that could stand before that when God whatever God spoke his promises ain't nothing can stand before that and you start looking at that like Lord we are more than conquerors sicknesses trials all these things he said that with his stripes we are healed right he said I'm the Lord thy God that healeth all those disease he talked about you know I'll bring healing I'll bring it and the Cure come on but what it is you say what God got the cure for every disease every sickness all of them God got the cure for every one of them what's the cure here's the word what's the cure he is the cure you know I was thinking about it I says that you know uh uh looking at some hard situations I said well you trust God I was looking at uh last week you're talking to some people at the job and one of the co-workers or son got killed you know and he was only 22 years old so it was a hard situation for her but I began to talk to her and I began to say you know don't let this situation break you she said Earnest it's real hard she got five other Sons let's say it's real hard she says real hard because he got killed and I could see the the the the hurt all over and all that but I told her I said you know even in all of this it's still healing there and I thought about you know the Lord was dealing with me on a little sermon the healer is here in that hurt in that pain even in in your worst hurt and your worst pain the healer is here he knows how to heal those wounds those those cuts those scars those those deep slashes because you know the devil do that wounds you in the place you know the Bible said a wound the spirit is hard to Bear the devil got a way of doing that don't he putting you know weights on you wound Ninja hurting you so bad the way you can't you don't have the joy no more you can't smile it's hard to get up in the morning even it's hard to get out the bed because of the hurt and the pain but the healer is here the healer is here to heal all wounds he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel come on preach Deliverance to the captives Hallelujah you know what I say is that the Healer I start thinking about the healer is here I start I start thinking about that little scripture to cast all your cares upon the Lord because he care for you I started thinking about how he says come unto me all ye that are heavy laying with burden and I'll give you rest heavy Birds you know it's some heavy burdens out there ain't it I was telling them last night as my family I was saying you know sometimes you think you you you had it bad you had a bad situation you gotta you come out of something real bad or you had hard trials wait till you heard the next Man story it's always the next man's story then when you hear their story you start saying thank you Lord the little trials and you start calling them little trials and little situations because now when you heard the next Man story you can glory for the little trials and the little situation that you had because it could have been worse you know could have been way worse than what it is right now but God didn't suffer it to be so he know how much you can stand how much you can bear so he just let the little wind blow a little bit and he brought you out of it so I looked at that I says Lord you know I'm gonna trust you In This Storm imma trust you and the wind the rain I'm gonna trust you everybody turn around I say will you trust God I'm gonna trust you yes that's that's easy sometimes when everybody when family and everybody's going with you but if they turn around will you trust God come on let's talk to job about it job lost his children didn't he lost all his friends then even his wife came to him curse your guard and die but job did what he trusted God didn't he I said well you trust God I'll trust him when everybody else is gone when y'all when your pillar like I was saying the other week sometimes uh we got a crutch something to help hold us up but God gonna take away the crutch when he take away what's holding you up will you still trust God are you to the point in your life the way you say God I'ma love you no matter what I'ma serve you no matter what come today come tomorrow God I'ma trust you I know that this you know you look at lives you look at your own life you know the footsteps are the Righteous they're ordered by who by the Lord right so your path has already been cut out God is ordained you to walk that walk now some things we put on ourself but in a faithful in a righteous life God is our danger to walk that walk so when you on that Journey you know you're looking at that that Journey but you can say like David yeah though I walk through the valley in the shadow of death I don't fear no evil thou art with me I know that God your words is a lamp to my feet and light to my path this is my path and your word is leading me down this path your word is going to help me make it through this path hard cut paths you look at sometimes you might be on a trail or going out wherever and you come into some thick brushes so where you got to move back trees and you got to do all things to get through them sometimes you might want to turn around and go back but nevertheless your destination is on the other side I look at like Lord no matter what I got to go through the end of the story I want to hear you say Well done thy good and faithful servant I was riding on the road the other day and I was thinking no matter what happens in this life what you get what you don't get what comes and what don't happen what you don't achieve at the end of the story the greatest thing is to hear you got to hear them say Well done when you stand in there you got to say I'm hear him say enter into the joys of the Lord you've been faithful with the little you've been faithful come on now I'm Gonna Make You rule over man you gotta hear him say that that that's what matters God if I'm stripped of everything let me still have you Lord not just I have you but God you get you keep holding me and that's what you know that's what that anchoring is about in a time of Peace you know it's hard to get that anchor down on that rock when the storms and everything is tossing the boat's moving and oh it's hard to get anchored then but in the time of Peace that's when you anchor that ship you know that storm is coming so you make sure that anchor is down there you get down you get prayed up then hallelujah you get your breakthroughs then because it has come times where you can't pray like you ought to you can't break through like you ought to but in the time of Peace you got anchored so when the wind's blowing you say Lord I couldn't do uh what I wanted to today but that Anchor's down there something kept you and I know it was God I look up all the time I say God I know it was you I know it was him and you know what we ain't worthy majority of the time majority of the time we ain't worried that the grace of God we don't even deserve his Mercy but God is merciful you know the Bible talked about it he was rich in Mercy come on he was rich in Mercy I thank God because I said Lord we don't even deserve half of what you've done for us we don't deserve what you're doing for us right now we will Grace God come on but was to have fellowship with us for some reason God wanted fellowship with us I don't know why like they said he loved me but I'm so glad he did I don't know why God chose me but I'm glad he did Hallelujah by your own shoes and you wouldn't have chose God but God chose you and he drawn you with his love and kindness didn't he come on his loving kindness God draws you oh sometimes we have that pity partner those things for ourselves don't you know God draws you with love and kindness don't you know that the half ain't been told as rich as his glory Untold waiting on you come on we ain't doing these things but it's things waiting on you it's a rich is Untold waiting on you Hallelujah and I'm excited about it are you excited about it come on but I said will you trust God come on we know that you know in in this we all just read the scripture and how you know in that time they had it was a trust Factor wasn't it you know it had rained and and in a while and everything dried up and the first thing he asked her for was to get him some water right now you know it's a drop and even if we did have a water we ain't got but so much it ain't raining and no do but the first thing the prophet asked this woman for was water didn't he but you know what she was going to get it wasn't she you think about that she was going to get that water and then he says well you know bring me back a cake and all that but then she began to say okay you know I ain't got enough right it's already a drop she she ain't thought about it she going to get the water now you want the cake and all this she says you know she hadn't told them that she had done accepted death come on out the Gathering sticks the the way it was so such a desperate time that she had already accepted death didn't she because she was gathering together to eat her last meal think about that that was a bad situation wasn't it to know that you know but you know it comes to that way she don't accept it death because the situation was that hard you know the devil can put things on people's lives or situations can get so bad in your life to where you want to die to where you accept death to where you say oh I'm ready to go Hallelujah the situation got that hard Hallelujah but God shows up every time don't he God ain't gonna never leave his people David said I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor is he begging for bread God ain't gonna leave his people situation get hard and you look like you're done giving up or ready to give up then God shows up Hallelujah God shows up don't he we're a word he says but now that's what I want you to do he says you make me make me first you know and and you know I can see her maybe you know thinking of mine I just told them we gonna gather this together and die and now he want that right but thus said if the Lord came forth didn't it so even even in that she still had to trust God didn't she I said well you trust God God coming for your last you don't think God coming for the last God coming for the last somebody says we already going through and he coming for the last he's coming for everything he want to see how much you trust him he want to see that will you go all the way with them come on because he don't really need it he owned every cattle on the hill you know he's a Creator he can do all things but he want to see if you're going to be faithful with the looter that he gave you come on sometimes you know looking at money and things all the times which is true but you know sometimes you're looking at your life your time your willingness your pressing I say as you know it's something about that faithfulness God wants you to be faithful you know I was thinking I said you know you're you're his bride come on you're Lamb's wife right and in relationships faithful mean faithfulness is a whole lot ain't it come on it hurts your heart find out the one you're in a relationship with ain't faithful going out running with another man or another woman that hurt real bad won't it somebody said it won't hurt me I it don't matter to me it hurts you bad I was telling the guy the other day I ain't gonna say what I told him I ain't gonna say across the pulpit but I said it gonna hurt you it hurts you you know and I says but us being natural people like that how God feel how you think God feel you being his wife he wants you to be faithful right you know he looking down on you like we're saying today everything was in the way but I pray that God looking down and say but he's still pressed Hallelujah come on he still pushed this way you know and I you do it because you love God you do it because when he was in guess cinnamon he was praying Lord let this cup pass from me because he had a hard road in front of him but then he said Lord not my will but let thy will be done he pressed for you and I didn't he because he know that if he didn't press we wouldn't be saved today all the goodness uh and the kindness that God has shown towards us wouldn't be here today come on that bridge wouldn't be Gap the way we can get back to the Tree of Life so he pressed he went he he took the Hard Road didn't he he said it's a hard cup but he took that hard cup so that you and I can get back to the tree of life he pressed I said Lord help me to press if I'm limping help me to press if I'm tired and wore out I want to press if I got to drag help me to press car broke down no matter what I want to press come on press my way through to get to Jesus say what you gonna do when you get there I want to worship him I want to tell him how much I love him I want to tell them thank you for giving me life health and strength thank you for bringing me through another week you know the other week he was talking about at work they had five murders over the weekend then then everybody looked like the city went crazy during the week one thing after another but God brought us through that didn't he you say well they had nothing to do with us if God wouldn't have had his mercy and Grace around you Woulda if the angels of God if the hand of God wouldn't have been on you would have had something to do with you but God's hands been around you his grace was there he covered you people have lost their minds but God has still kept you Hallelujah I'm glad for the grace of God I'm excited for what God is doing for me I thank the Lord for what he's done for me it's worth my dying come on it's worth my crying it's worth my living and giving and all those things I know it's worth it come on I said well you trust God come on I asked you tonight well you trust God come on it's hard I was talking to God one of the guys at work and he was telling me he slammed something on the desk he said Earnest everything going on at one time and the last straw was that his air conditioner went out of his house it was 90 something degrees you know and I began to say he said everything is going on at one time Ernest he said that I was getting a thing to myself I said you know when when we as Believers see everything going on at one time he might catch you off guard from the beginning but then a smile come on your face because you know that God Gathering them all together to deal with them all at one time because why God ain't never lost the battle you ain't gonna be you ain't gonna lose this battle when it's all going down at one time gather them all together Hallelujah because God's Gonna deal with them I believe that Hallelujah oh Jesus come on do y'all believe that tonight I'm serious or somehow come on your face why because you know to God you know who you serving you know that every time God's children was put in a hopeless situation or dire distress or desperation God came on the scene you know that right just by looking in his word you know that just by looking back over your life you know that that God he never failed he always showed up didn't he all I got to do is stay faithful come on and stay the course God don't show up and take care of this situation I believe it come on no matter what it is I begin to uh and the guy was saying that and I you know I was able to help him out with his air conditioner but other little question problems he had but I said that's the thing about it when you like that you know what it's only one person can help you and that's God because man I can help you through the grace of God with certain situations for this other situations it's only one that can help you and that's God you're frustrated you're at your ends with that's what God wants you at come on everybody that unfailed you don't gave up you don't gave up you don't throw your hands up God if God be God where's all his miracles at he shows up then don't he do y'all believe that tonight come on but I say is that God that's what it is he specializes in those hopeless situations them hopeless cases come on I said God coming for your last you gonna give him your last she had a decision to make didn't she but yet she still trusted God didn't I say well you trust God I don't know about you but I'ma trust him you know when she trusted God he never failed or did he come on you know Faith Like I said stands alone and they had to see it but something must have revealed to her that what thus saith the Lord was it was going to come to pass come on I had accepted death but I ain't got to die no more because the hill is here I had accepted my sickness but I ain't got to be sick no more because the hill is here I had accepted my situation but I ain't accepting it no more why because God is here now the healer is here I will wound it but the Healer here I got my joy back now come on I could praise God again I can clap my hands come on I said get your hand clap bae you know I was looking at some old videos they had church I said we got to start having church again they were they look like they was feeling good in those videos but you know what it is something about it I said will you trust God come on you know most of the time we Bound By by the situations and things that's going on in our life you know they dictate whether you're happy or not they dictate whether you can smile they dictate how your body feel all those things pressures your life dictate those things they choke you choke the everything out of you the life out of you but when when when you realize that that none of those all these things like I said it's a beating it's a path that God got you on when you realize that God is in control I was sharing that with a few people last week I was saying you know God is in control of every situation they was telling me about situations I said God is in control of every situation you know that situation you're dealing with God is in control he is I said well you hear control yeah he in control of the wind and the rain don't you know the same God is the one that stood up on that boat one night and said peace be still that's the same God if he had control of the wind and the storms back then what about now come on he didn't change and none of his power none of his statue did he he's the same yesterday to Dance Forever God is in control somebody's saying about this situation whatever I said yeah God isn't God is in control of that you just trust God I say well you trust him or will you draw back you know you have no you have no um no no uh rewarding drawing back no reward if the situation only get worse come on but if you trust God you say Lord come on that lady said if I could touch but the Hem of His Garment right I've been sick all this time spent all my money don't got no more money I could just accept it stay like this but she says that it was a crowd around him but I'm impressed if I can I believe if I can just touch to him something happened to me if I can get to him I I believe it come on and that's what it is even blind barter males they said don't cry cry the loudest crowd louder didn't he come on even out of all of that God heard them didn't it and what it is here's that Faith cry it was it was a cry that man that that normal I would say man can't produce that crime but the situation to stress the trial brought it on didn't it but that cry God heard it I love when God shows up I love when God shows up and you say Lord God tell you I know you've been you've been fighting all night I know you've been bottling I heard you the first day you was praying I was there the first night the first night the womb came I was still there I ain't left you because I promise you I'll never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even then that's my word that's what I said I ain't went back on my word I was there the first night that you that you was in pain I was there that night and I was there like like that little song it's been a long journey and Jesus has been right here by my side he ain't left you he still he and then he shows up he says you know but what it did it brought care Dodge it brought patience out you it brought long suffers out you've grown now Hallelujah you learn how to trust and depend on Jesus you learned that you didn't just know that overnight or you heard somebody talking about that but God taught you that he taught you that if you hold out you'll be stronger in the morning he taught you that we couldn't do it for a night he taught you those things we quoted scriptures as a child but God tortured him didn't he through the trials of life God taught you what he meant by that right and you learned that if I can just keep it in God's hand if I can I just gonna trust in Jesus and I know that everything gonna work out it always has and it always will Hallelujah even in depth of the workout why because you've been born again you can't die Hallelujah go in the ground that's just the body of shell but you're going into your new body he says a new body I've prepared for you right at my father's house there are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you come on and I believed that Hallelujah so when you come to that conclusion that not even death can stop you Hallelujah not even not even those things it's just helping you get the way you're going at and I'm trusting God God I'm gonna trust you with my life I'm gonna trust you with everything I got I'm gonna trust God I said will you trust God tonight come on I love the Lord I said God I'm gonna trust you you know and that's what it is we got we got to learn you don't want to belong tonight but we got to learn to trust God I thought about so many so many uh examples in the Bible and I said God coming for your last when God Isaac finally came God came for him didn't he didn't he see if we gonna give it up will you trust God but it's something about Abraham he was just he was trusting God wasn't he he told them he said you stay here me and the lad go on the sacrifice and we'll return right but his trust was there come on he trusted God you know sometimes we got trust issues don't we because so many times people let you down people ain't come through so you don't trust nobody right but it ain't a time that God ever ever promised that he ain't come through oh he wasn't there unless it was something you know you and I done maybe the hinder the move of God but other than that God God never failed he always did what he promised he'll do he always showed up come on but yet a lot of times we got trust issues but what God does what God does he lets it all fail you till you have no other choice but to trust him you have no other choice but to look to him come on then he shows up but what is he doing all that for to build your trust up you know I like how when when when Moses died and God told you know he brought him out to the land but before they went into the land you know God took Moses away that Mighty leader didn't he took him away looked like you know the mighty leader that brought us out now we got to go into land without him but nevertheless God wanted to build trust in them didn't he he told Joshua we know what the whole thing of what happened and how he he disobeyed God and I smote The Rock instead of uh speaking to it and all we know that but I'm just saying it looks something how you know what could have might have been on the people's heart that Moses led us all the way now we're here and what happens God shows God takes Moses off to see him come on but nevertheless I like how God told Joshua as I was with Moses come on I want you to trust me as I was with Moses so I'ma be with you I want failure nor forsake you come on he says but I want you to keep my word and he said it won't be an enemy that'll be able to stand before you our father be an enemy to your enemy I'll fight all your battles for you come on in every place that your foot touch it'll be yours as I was with Moses I'm Gonna Be With You come on but I want you to trust me you got to trust me come on you got to trust and believe that I'm gonna do what I said come on I wanna I wanna bring that trust to you I say well you trust God come on as I was with Moses he said I'll be with you that same way come on and even here tonight come on God don't got no respect to persons does he come on God hears that little one don't it God hears that little one God's here God hears that little one prayer and he comes to the rescue God hears that one nobody can remember their name prayer and he comes to the rescue God hears that one crying out and about because they can't even make it to the house of the Lord down Sick everybody forgot about him but the Lord hears them and he goes by and sees about them don't he Hallelujah I'm so glad he does that I'm so glad because sometimes people don't know what you're dealing with what you're facing with but God does and he shows up don't he you know that's one thing when the Lord first saved me and I was I got a lot of alone time and you know just being by myself but the Lord showed me that he's a friend to the friendless he shows me that's where you built that real relationship with God because what you normally would talk to your friends and your mom and dad and everybody else about now you on your knees talking to God about because nobody's there nobody there to hear about will hear but God always got an ear and you you learn to just talk it over with Jesus talk it over with God and then what it is God you know start answering your prayer God start moving he speak back to you it's just you and God come on develop I mean building that relationship come on God taking you into that place to trust then you know you start that Journey with you and him alone so if everybody else walk away then it was just you and him that started the journey right and I'm glad I'm glad of that that God does that I'm glad that God does that but I said will you trust God come on will you trust God tonight it don't matter uh you know whatever you're dealing with whatever situation where you trust God come on you know that work that they asked me to hang a light and I didn't hang that light I'm thinking to myself well it's real simple 30 minutes at the most I was at 12 o'clock man I hung that light and knocked out the lights in the court of the building I was like what in the world I couldn't understand it a simple single phase light brother Gerald LED knocked out a whole bunch of Lights in the building everybody come out the office in the office too yeah they covered office what what so I'm looking at it like I don't know I said maybe a break I see she listened to today I said maybe I'll break a trip we all over the place okay if I had to break a trip nowhere so I don't hook it we couldn't get them lights back over three hours that's the Lord knows so that the we had to make this matter to everybody out there he pulled off he found a receptacle in the ceiling with the wire nut burn up and we ain't even bother that so anyway we hooked it up and the lights and all come back on so I said okay so it's like Earnest you could probably hook it back in and I'll say hey messing with that circuit no more we'll try another circuit I went and hooked that thing up it was like a Roman Candle shout out Sparks everywhere Ernest you all right I said something is wrong four o'clock I mean almost four o'clock I said something is wrong the man is better looking at me said cut it Earnest cut it because they wanted me to hang it up because somebody like to fell down the stairs so now they want us to light this whole area up right so like I'm looking at it and I had not ordered something from Subway at 12 30 and told you know be there ready at one Subway calling me to go pick the food up I had nothing to drink in about three hours because you know up in the ceiling I'm like I couldn't understand it so I told him I said you know what I don't know that's why I tell them I don't know but I said maybe because I was thinking I ain't gonna be the you know writer you know God showed you that that oh it's real simple hey simple no more it's supposed to work but it ain't working because you know everything is moving by the power of God later it supposed to work but it ain't working side side know what well I'll tell you what I'm gonna do because you know they want you to be there to get the lights back on I said I'm gonna cut this thing out and I'm gonna hook it all back up you know when they throw that switch so I don't know what else to do hooked it all back up the same way and cut it on and come right on and the maintenance matter said cut it off let's try it again cut it off cut it on it came right back on flip it on up down so I looked at him and I said I don't know I have no idea I said but I'm about to pack my tools up go home but it shows you then I says Lord I'm worn out and uh come on got home what at some time after six o'clock got home so washed up because I had already said I'm gonna come out here all in something Maryland get in prayer I had already I'd already made my day out right so then uh go on wash up throw my clothes on us almost seven o'clock go down there Pharaoh Road and um and uh what is it Hard Scrabble the light won't turn is letting all the other lights is letting this way go it's even letting the people cross go and turn but our light won't turn and I'm in a traffic where cars where you came you're in and out and I'm looking now we're not sitting here 10 minutes almost about 10 minutes after seven I says I said everything is trying to keep me from going to church tonight so I was like man you know what sat there in the light the light turned over there then it turned green to here again then it turned over there and it turned green here again I was like Lord I've seen it do that before but not tonight you know so I seen I said you know what I was able to get just around one car I went up about a start and I swung around I was gonna go the other way as soon as I swung around now this light turned red you know somebody would have ran it but I said you know what I sat there and then it turned green and I come on I caused Charlotte and him I told her don't go that way but I was thinking you know what it's a press sometime ain't it but nevertheless I said I'm glad to even be in the number I'm glad to even you know I says God must speak out a blessing for us tonight I said God must be want to do something for us tonight you know and that's why the devil is doing all he can God must be got a blessing you know a still Small Voice something gonna happen that's the way I felt something got to happen tonight because it was too much in our way too much hinder too much roadblocks and I said God thank you if it's just a refreshing God I want that refresh Hallelujah somebody asked me why I keep saying come on so much because I said when I preached I preach it to myself too I'm Amen to

that a hundred times in maintenance and I prayed to the Lord with the job I said Lord it's got to be a demon because it never happened until church night wait a minute and it still happens now so I changed our night of church and help me follow Thursday night too it followed me to Thursday night it is the devil because it tries to hinder you but I appreciate the Lord tonight and my brother Ernest brought out I mean that same area but I'm preaching faith is our victory and if faith is our victory than to get Victory you must have an angel the angel told the prophet to be more sincere and that angel tonight is with you is ushering you into prayer to reinforce the holy spirit in your life that you can be more sincere because the Angel takes you through the sickness problems because it ushers you into praying and I told the church if you got a problem where's your angel the angel told the prophet go back and make it right you told your wife to tell him you wasn't here you can't pray for this little girl he made it right that angel told him to go back when he went to pray for the girl and he went back and made it right and then he went and prayed for we must have an angel so we don't miss prayer we don't miss reading our Bible faith is our Victory God bless you [Applause] I mean how many of you enjoy the word you let us all stand it's good remember what I heard in Jesus Christ's name and I guess brother Ernest preaching on me tonight amen all week long for the last couple of weeks I had one hurdle after another you know with a I learned something you know when you
