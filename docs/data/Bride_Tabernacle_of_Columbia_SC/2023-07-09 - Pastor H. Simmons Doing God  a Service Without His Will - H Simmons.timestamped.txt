[37:19] commit the service in the word of Grace
[37:21] into your hand do you for your blessings
[37:24] upon your children in your word in Jesus
[37:28] name amen
[37:30] as we look at the Romans 12
[37:34] um
[37:36] servant of God says trying to do God a
[37:39] service without it being his will
[37:43] amen
[37:45] trying to do God of service without it
[37:48] being this will
[37:53] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[37:56] mercies of God that you present your
[37:58] bodies Living Sacrifice
[38:02] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[38:04] your reasonable service
[38:08] and be not conformed to this world but
[38:10] be you transformed by the renewing of
[38:12] your mind that you may prove what is
[38:15] that good acceptable
[38:17] and perfect
[38:18] will of God
[38:20] may God bless you read his words you may
[38:22] be seated
[38:25] see I I like what he says
[38:28] you know we can try to do God a service
[38:30] without it being his will but we want to
[38:32] know God I want to be how about you
[38:35] brother and sister do you want to be in
[38:37] his perfect will
[38:39] amen see sometimes you know we have a
[38:42] will but God has a will
[38:44] and and we got to make our decision Lord
[38:47] I want to be in your perfect will
[38:49] amen
[38:51] because I know amen God has a perfect
[38:55] will for my life and I don't want to be
[38:57] in the permission will but I want to be
[38:59] in the perfect will of God
[39:02] now you know I I got to keep saying this
[39:06] because it's done in prayer it seemed
[39:10] like you know it's just
[39:13] sometimes you have certain trademarks
[39:16] and
[39:18] um I I was thinking on that
[39:21] what we want
[39:23] we
[39:25] we don't need
[39:28] and what we need we don't want
[39:33] and and that's when we when we talk
[39:35] about Dodge perfect we are what we what
[39:37] we want we don't need and what we need
[39:40] we don't want him
[39:43] but the Bible says but God would supply
[39:45] all of our needs according to his riches
[39:48] in glory
[39:49] as we think about God's uh will for our
[39:52] lives
[39:54] let's think about you know God
[39:57] am I interested see because a lot of
[40:00] times we're not interested in God's
[40:03] perfect will or God will for our lives
[40:05] at all
[40:06] see because we don't have God in our
[40:10] plan and and our intentions our intent
[40:14] but the Bible said the word of God is a
[40:17] quick power sharpening into his sword
[40:19] and those you know even to the zone of
[40:22] thoughts in the tents of the heart and
[40:24] and so forth I know it says cuts to the
[40:27] joints in the marrow amen and so forth
[40:30] but I'm not trying to quote it right now
[40:32] I'm just trying to get to it knows the
[40:35] intents of our hearts
[40:37] see because God knows that the intent of
[40:40] our hearts the word of God discerns the
[40:42] intent of our heart and because our
[40:45] heart
[40:46] uh
[40:48] uh it's not on God how hard in our minds
[40:52] is not to please God and if our hearts
[40:56] and our minds are not to please God then
[40:58] the Bible said we'll be plea we want to
[41:01] please ourselves
[41:03] are you whooping so are you interested
[41:06] in pleasing God are you pleasing
[41:07] yourself now let's just just mind you
[41:10] when you please yourself
[41:13] it's only going to be for a season
[41:16] but what God will he's not willing that
[41:19] he should perish but all should come to
[41:21] repentance
[41:23] amen so God so loved the world that he
[41:26] gave his only begotten son whosoever
[41:28] believe in him should not perish but
[41:29] have everlasting life
[41:31] God wants you to live amen
[41:35] but we understand that
[41:38] if we're not focused if we're not
[41:40] focused you know it's it takes God to
[41:43] give us Focus
[41:44] because if our minds just out there
[41:47] somewhere you know I I know I'm in
[41:51] church and I know I I I I'm here in this
[41:54] earth and in this world but I I don't
[41:58] have a purpose
[42:00] and I don't you know I'm just moving
[42:04] through here and just doing what I want
[42:07] to do
[42:08] but you got to find out God what is your
[42:12] perfect will
[42:14] it's a lot of people go to church
[42:17] and then their intense is that I'm going
[42:20] through my uh a form of godliness I'm
[42:24] going through worship I'm going through
[42:26] church because this is what I I supposed
[42:29] to do but I'm not I I'm not gonna let
[42:32] God Amen control my life
[42:37] it's not that there's intending to say
[42:40] I'm not letting God control my life I'm
[42:43] doing what I feel led to do
[42:49] you know
[42:51] the prophet was talking about
[42:53] um
[42:55] David had good intents and who wanted to
[42:57] bring not back to Israel and so forth as
[43:00] it was taken away in the days of Saul
[43:03] and so forth and they lost the ark and
[43:05] all but they wanted to bring the art
[43:08] back the word back wanted to bring
[43:10] Revival back and that was a good intent
[43:12] but they bought it back on Arch car
[43:16] and and
[43:18] it wasn't supposed to be bought back
[43:19] that way
[43:21] it was supposed to be bad on the
[43:23] shoulders of men
[43:25] are you with me
[43:27] and so
[43:28] um
[43:29] in the in that caught the the ark began
[43:33] to shake and the man put forth his hand
[43:36] and he fell dead
[43:38] for touching
[43:40] see what I'm saying is that our
[43:43] intentions might be good
[43:46] and said what David did he didn't
[43:50] he didn't consult Nathan the prophet
[43:54] and we need to construct God on our
[43:57] actions we don't consult God
[44:01] I remember the time people were really
[44:02] pray and ask God shall I do this until I
[44:06] do that and then sometimes they'll back
[44:08] it up ask the preachers
[44:10] do you need me is it all right they
[44:13] don't care about the preach they don't
[44:14] care nothing about God I'm gonna tell
[44:16] you something how you treat one another
[44:17] that's how you treat God
[44:20] how you treat the preacher that's that's
[44:22] how you pre-treat God
[44:24] don't you got a relationship with God
[44:26] you have respect
[44:28] for one another
[44:32] if you ain't got no relationship with
[44:34] God you don't care how you treat other
[44:36] people
[44:37] you're interested in yourself
[44:40] are you a man
[44:42] yo I don't care how spiritual you think
[44:45] y'all but if you don't have uh uh a
[44:49] relationship with God in a in an
[44:51] intimate way you don't care about nobody
[44:54] but yourself
[44:55] very selfish
[44:58] but when you got a relationship with God
[45:00] you care about others
[45:03] amen you live your life
[45:06] amen for others you don't live your life
[45:08] for yourself
[45:10] are you with me
[45:12] but sometimes we're so involved with our
[45:16] wants
[45:18] that we don't even see our needs
[45:23] we're so involved in what we want to
[45:26] it's never God
[45:28] you know sometimes we don't say Our
[45:30] Father prayer Our Father which on heaven
[45:32] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom Come
[45:34] Thou
[45:36] oh no no no no I don't even say that
[45:39] prayer no more it's too traditional
[45:42] you know sometimes I you know I find
[45:44] myself Our Father which are in heaven I
[45:46] love you that day you know what I'm
[45:48] saying and then I think about thy will
[45:50] be done
[45:53] I want your will to be done in my life
[45:56] do you really want God's will to be done
[45:59] no no because I already doing you know
[46:03] sometimes
[46:04] everything that looks like a blessing
[46:07] may not be a blessing
[46:08] somebody might say I want to lay a
[46:10] million dollars before you and you must
[46:12] get in the shot thank god oh it's a
[46:14] blessing don't you think the game is
[46:16] godliness
[46:18] everything that looks like a blessing
[46:20] everything's shining ain't gold
[46:23] and everything that amen that that is
[46:27] laid before you and and sometimes amen
[46:31] things that are available to you
[46:33] I had many opportunities in life
[46:36] you know and a lot of times it was Grand
[46:39] opportunities opportunities to be you
[46:43] know multi-millionaires and all of that
[46:45] kind of stuff and he said well why do
[46:47] you take it if I over I had the
[46:48] opportunity I was a ticket is that the
[46:51] will of God
[46:53] will this bring you into bondage
[46:57] you know you you feel like God I can't
[47:00] take this
[47:02] oftentimes talk about the church
[47:05] done in Louisiana the pastor cried
[47:07] because I wouldn't take it I had 500
[47:09] anyway for 500 to a thousand people the
[47:12] half white and half black church
[47:15] and I you know
[47:17] he said anything you want just let me
[47:19] know you want to fly home you need this
[47:21] whatever we'll take care anything you
[47:24] want but God told me to give you this
[47:26] church
[47:30] oh God so
[47:32] and when I didn't take it him and his
[47:34] wife started crying
[47:35] I didn't know he was sick
[47:40] and and he felt like God sent me to take
[47:42] it
[47:44] and I wouldn't take him
[47:48] I know a friend of mine a brother he
[47:51] bought me back in the time when the
[47:54] Lancers it was was you know the big car
[47:56] the thing
[47:58] about me one of those big lankas and
[47:59] said it's yours I said I don't want to
[48:01] take you back
[48:03] I didn't want to see him riding in one
[48:05] of those things
[48:06] because I would have been a big time
[48:07] preacher
[48:09] had a big image
[48:11] see sometimes everything that looked
[48:13] like a blessing you got to know that God
[48:15] got a plan and a will for your life you
[48:17] can take the big things and the high
[48:19] road and look good and everybody patting
[48:23] you on the back and oh you thinking
[48:25] something amen
[48:26] going places
[48:29] you know what I'm saying
[48:31] it see sometimes we we think that we're
[48:35] God is blessing oh Look What the Lord
[48:38] blessed me with oh Lord people are
[48:42] shouting on the wrong thing
[48:44] they look at the outside but they don't
[48:46] see the inside
[48:48] amen what is God what are you Discerning
[48:51] would this thing bring you closer to God
[48:55] sometimes it's the things they man that
[48:58] God want to bring you in a closer
[48:59] relationship with him but you don't you
[49:02] sometimes you know you struggle and you
[49:05] battle because you just want to do you
[49:07] just want to live
[49:10] I mean it's time out for just a living
[49:12] it's time to seek God's will for your
[49:15] life
[49:16] it's time out you should go come to
[49:18] church and think you go through the
[49:20] motions amen it's time out just going
[49:23] through the motions coming to church you
[49:25] need to find out God what is your will
[49:27] for me
[49:29] amen it's time amen that we find out
[49:32] that God has a plan in the backwards
[49:37] and God I want to know you
[49:41] it's time to know God there's too many
[49:44] times people get way up the road and
[49:47] they fail to know God
[49:50] but I want to know you God
[49:55] I want to know you and I want to I want
[49:58] God to speak to him I want to hear your
[50:00] voice
[50:01] I want to know you're talking to me
[50:04] amen I'm not just coming to church
[50:07] reveal yourself to me Lord
[50:10] Show Me Your Glory
[50:13] I want to know him
[50:15] see we we just go through the motion
[50:19] then we all religious
[50:21] I mean all religions we think that we we
[50:24] we think that we we got it we got it
[50:27] made it's a religious
[50:31] spirit that has people trapped
[50:34] amen
[50:35] I remember times brother came to me he
[50:38] says
[50:39] and he said pastor I want to pay your
[50:42] way to Jerusalem huh
[50:44] and I you know I'm going to Jerusalem
[50:48] and I want to get to a ticket and I want
[50:50] to I want you to go to Jerusalem
[50:53] and I want to pay for it
[50:59] I ain't interested
[51:02] and about a year later he came back
[51:03] again said I'm going back to the rules
[51:06] and I want to pay your ticket
[51:08] I want to play your way
[51:13] you see what I'm saying but you know we
[51:15] get opportunities in life and every time
[51:18] it's a door white wide open we chop in
[51:20] it
[51:21] everything that looks good we're Chum in
[51:24] it but we don't pray about it that God
[51:26] is your will
[51:28] you know everybody everybody tell me you
[51:30] know come back from Jerusalem or you
[51:32] don't know what you miss know what you
[51:34] miss
[51:35] and I said oh boy maybe I should have
[51:37] took one of those trips now it's gonna
[51:39] cause me then maybe I don't know how
[51:41] many thousands of dollars to take I mean
[51:44] back then it probably just for four or
[51:46] five thousand but now it's probably
[51:48] about 10.
[51:51] but
[51:52] here we we jump into opportunities we
[51:57] jump into things Without Really seeking
[52:00] God really die now now I'm gonna tell
[52:02] you something like I tell uh uh all the
[52:04] time if it's the will of God it's going
[52:07] to be a hard thing sometimes
[52:10] God Amen because it ain't gonna be
[52:13] something the flesh wants
[52:16] it won't be something your flesh is
[52:18] designed
[52:20] if it's God's Will and God's purpose and
[52:23] God's plan it's going something that's
[52:25] going to come against the grain
[52:31] the bishop used to say any dead fish
[52:35] can go with the current but it takes a
[52:38] lot of fish to go against the current
[52:41] are you up man
[52:44] and and that's what it is it's going to
[52:46] take a lot somebody that's got some life
[52:49] in them so some power him the god gets
[52:53] the current
[52:55] that's why I said don't be conformed to
[52:57] this world but be you transformed by the
[53:00] renewing of your mind
[53:01] let's go take somebody with some holy
[53:04] ghosts
[53:06] but God gets the grain
[53:08] to not to be conformed to this world
[53:10] it's going to take something in the
[53:12] inside it's going to take a God that's
[53:15] in the inside
[53:16] it's going to take the power of God
[53:19] for you to go against the grave
[53:22] it's going to take the Holy Ghost
[53:25] without the Holy Ghost you ain't going
[53:27] to be able to go against this world he
[53:29] said be not conformed to this world
[53:32] but be your transformed
[53:35] by the renewing of your mind
[53:38] amen it takes the Holy Ghost the
[53:40] transform us because Satan is a deformer
[53:45] and he would deform you
[53:48] and he would conform you
[53:52] and to this world
[53:54] and we know that all that is in the
[53:56] world is the lust of the flesh the lust
[53:58] of the eyes and the pride of life
[54:01] are you a man
[54:03] what Satan is offering you you're going
[54:05] to glorify you it won't glorify God
[54:08] it's going to please your flesh it's not
[54:10] going to please God
[54:13] when it comes down to pleasing God is
[54:15] something on the inside
[54:17] Hallelujah
[54:18] you say God get all the glory out of
[54:21] this you won't even know it sometimes it
[54:24] meant to ask what they know because God
[54:27] got the glory
[54:29] you won't even know what he's done until
[54:31] it's all over
[54:34] praise God you've gone down the road a
[54:36] little bit and then after you get down
[54:38] the road thinking that you fail with God
[54:41] your dad was my plan
[54:44] that was my will
[54:47] praise God I took you through this and
[54:50] back that I might bring you to your
[54:52] blessings glory to God
[54:55] imma bring you to a place that you can
[54:58] experience my power
[55:01] glory to God
[55:03] I want you to experience my glory
[55:06] glory to God I want you to know what
[55:10] it's like to be lifted up
[55:12] praise God hallelujah after you've been
[55:15] through something hey God
[55:18] job Prophet didn't know what it was all
[55:20] over
[55:22] praise God that it was in the plan of
[55:24] God and the will of God for him to serve
[55:27] a little while
[55:28] come on
[55:30] praise God God was making him more than
[55:33] him Hallelujah there was something
[55:36] coming out
[55:38] God is molding character in each and
[55:40] every one of us
[55:42] they not do the things that we go to God
[55:45] is bringing us through amen the statue
[55:48] of a perfect man
[55:50] bringing us to that
[55:54] more than character
[55:57] but sometimes because we got a plan for
[56:00] our lives let me go to Ephesians
[56:05] I was going to go back then Samuel talks
[56:07] about the people said they want a king
[56:10] but they feed them one
[56:13] God bless you amen
[56:16] the people told Samuel
[56:18] because you Eli and and the first Samuel
[56:21] ate
[56:23] Eli's son wasn't living right wasn't
[56:26] doing right
[56:28] and Samuel had we got no
[56:30] and the people said to Samuel
[56:34] samya
[56:35] your sons ain't right
[56:38] and you all
[56:40] give us a king
[56:43] like we can be like all other nations
[56:46] are you up man
[56:48] you know the problem is I have trouble
[56:51] people amen want to be like
[56:54] everybody else

[57:03] the message that's how they do it over
[57:06] here in the denomination that's how they
[57:09] do it over here amen but you're
[57:11] individuals
[57:14] amen the Bible said Mark the what
[57:18] Mark the perfect man
[57:19] you're looking at Jesus you ain't
[57:21] looking at them
[57:23] your blessings don't come from the other
[57:26] people or from the outside where your
[57:28] percussions come from God you look to
[57:31] Jesus and said God you've got a plan for
[57:34] me this is an individual thing it ain't
[57:36] no group thing
[57:38] cause I'm in this particular church I'm
[57:41] in Broad Tabernacle I'm in the message
[57:43] I'm in this no no no it's you as an
[57:46] individual
[57:48] are you up man God wants to use you as
[57:51] an individual God wants to deal with you
[57:54] as an individual but
[57:56] you know I I was saying the sister
[57:58] Hannah I said people don't want to pray
[58:00] the Christ but they want the results
[58:02] that they used to have
[58:05] amen but they don't want to do what they
[58:06] used to do amen for the results that
[58:09] they used to have and see people are
[58:11] lying to themselves and saying that I'm
[58:14] where I used to be and I'm where I I I
[58:16] you know you want God to do what he used
[58:20] to do in your life but you ain't here
[58:22] you're not willing to do what you used
[58:24] to do
[58:26] praise God

[59:27] another if that's gonna bring God back
[59:30] if that don't bring the power of God
[59:31] back
[59:33] it's going to take somebody that's going
[59:35] to certain of us and you'll cry in God
[59:37] and really look for the coming of the
[59:39] Lord
[59:43] people who anticipating Jesus coming at

[1:19:39] I said time is winding up
[1:19:41] we're in the fullness of time now
[1:19:44] where time will be no longer he said to

[1:22:28] you bleed but after you bleed
[1:22:31] you will see it with the Holy Spirit of
[1:22:33] promise now
[1:22:35] being sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:22:37] Promise means of
[1:22:41] that means that when God sees you you
[1:22:44] know you're in the perfect will
[1:22:46] but God ain't gonna seal you with all
[1:22:49] that until you get all the growths out
[1:22:51] of you
[1:22:55] amen until you stop doing your own thing
[1:22:58] some people think they see you walk
[1:23:00] around seal but they still got their own
[1:23:03] mind and doing what they want to do and
[1:23:05] what they're big and bad enough to do
[1:23:07] going where they want to go doing what
[1:23:09] they want to do
[1:23:12] and they say uh Brett Simmons you my
[1:23:15] pastor or brother uh so and so on you
[1:23:19] you're Pastor so and so on you're about
[1:23:20] to ask no no you're doing whatever you
[1:23:23] big and bad enough to do
[1:23:26] nobody got oversight
[1:23:30] you told Paul to take him to the flock
[1:23:32] over to which the Holy Ghost has made
[1:23:34] you what
[1:23:35] overseer the feed the Church of God
[1:23:38] which he's purchased with his what
[1:23:40] own blood
[1:23:42] are you with me sometimes we got to
[1:23:44] understand
[1:23:45] God order God order for our lives God
[1:23:48] we're just going to do what we want
[1:23:50] right whenever we want don't care you
[1:23:54] don't care we just do it whatever we
[1:23:57] want when we want how we want
[1:24:00] but when you come down to them
[1:24:02] now this is the last verse
[1:24:06] it said which is the earnest
[1:24:09] the seal with the Holy Spirit of Promise
[1:24:12] the 14th verse it's the last one which
[1:24:15] is the earnest of our inheritance until
[1:24:18] the Redemption of the purchased
[1:24:21] possession until
[1:24:23] the praise of his what
[1:24:25] Glory I'm gonna tell you something God
[1:24:28] ain't gonna seal
[1:24:30] see you into your character to you come
[1:24:33] into that statue that ceiling won't come
[1:24:36] you might be Anointed with the Holy
[1:24:37] Ghost and feel the power of God but that
[1:24:40] ceiling ain't gonna come you might have
[1:24:42] the spirit of God on your flesh and on
[1:24:43] your spirit but down in the inside you
[1:24:46] got to be sealed that means that you
[1:24:48] really need to do amen God I want your
[1:24:51] perfect will in my life
[1:24:54] I want to please you more than anything
[1:24:57] you know as we were reading the
[1:24:59] scripture in something the other day you
[1:25:01] want God more than your necessary food
[1:25:05] are you with me
[1:25:07] you want God's Will and plan it's not
[1:25:09] it's not no uh you know mouth it's
[1:25:12] action
[1:25:14] is something that you want to submit
[1:25:16] yourself to God when you submit yourself
[1:25:19] to the word of God you submit yourself
[1:25:20] to God
[1:25:22] but when you don't submit yourself to
[1:25:24] the word you're not going to submit
[1:25:25] yourself to God because God and His word
[1:25:28] is one they're beginning with the word
[1:25:29] the word was with God and we're with God
[1:25:31] when you submit yourself to the word of
[1:25:33] God you submit yourself to God
[1:25:35] amen and the Bible says all of you
[1:25:39] all of us submit ourselves one to
[1:25:41] another
[1:25:42] are you with me if there's no submission
[1:25:44] one to another
[1:25:46] amen
[1:25:48] I've never seen in an age before when
[1:25:51] people tell the preacher how to preach
[1:25:53] and what to preaching what to say and
[1:25:55] what not to say
[1:25:57] even when the preacher make a mistake
[1:25:58] the people forgive him
[1:26:01] but I've never seen an age like this
[1:26:04] people think that they can tell the
[1:26:06] preaching what to do
[1:26:08] I never seen such a thing in all these
[1:26:12] 50 years
[1:26:13] until this last day age
[1:26:17] where people's rights they want to
[1:26:19] control the preacher
[1:26:22] not even knowing no anointing that's on
[1:26:25] their lives
[1:26:26] instead of praying
[1:26:28] they want to complain
[1:26:33] did a praying and lifting the ministry
[1:26:36] up they want to tear down
[1:26:40] brothers and sisters it's better to lift
[1:26:42] Folks up than the Tad folks down
[1:26:45] no matter how many false they got
[1:26:48] it's better to pray for them and lift
[1:26:50] them up in prayer
[1:26:52] are you with me no matter how bad you
[1:26:54] think they are
[1:26:55] amen ain't worth
[1:26:58] you wasting your time criticizing them
[1:27:02] you need to be on your knees praying I
[1:27:04] see the condition
[1:27:07] and I know I need to pray more than ever
[1:27:10] are you with me
[1:27:13] because I'ma tell you you make a
[1:27:15] difference
[1:27:16] your prayers make a difference
[1:27:19] for one another your prayers make a
[1:27:21] difference for the ministry your prayers
[1:27:23] make a difference
[1:27:25] your talk make a difference
[1:27:29] it'd make a big difference too
[1:27:32] you're criticize and make a difference
[1:27:35] but you're proud
[1:27:38] amen your pride in love
[1:27:43] and in concerning care oh boy what a
[1:27:46] difference
[1:27:47] when you love and you concern and you

[1:27:59] and when you lift them up from your
[1:28:01] heart
[1:28:04] it reaches heaven
[1:28:06] and you say oh oh so-and-so made changes
[1:28:10] it may changes why because your prayer
[1:28:13] works
[1:28:15] not your criticism your prayers
