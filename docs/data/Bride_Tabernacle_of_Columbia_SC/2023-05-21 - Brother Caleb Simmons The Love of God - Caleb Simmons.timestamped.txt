[33:40] best of Pastor in his absence Lord and

[33:45] this morning Lord we as you come now in
[33:48] our mission Lord send your anointing
[33:50] power in Jesus name we pray amen
[33:54] hey man if you have your Bibles this
[33:56] morning we turn to the Book of Romans
[33:58] Romans chapter 5. amen
[34:24] Romans chapter 5 and we'll start at
[34:26] verse 6.
[34:33] when you got to say Amen
[34:36] Romans chapter 5 and verse 6.
[34:40] but when we were yet without Strength In
[34:43] Due Time Christ died for the ungodly but
[34:46] scarcely for a righteous man will one
[34:48] die yet pre-adventure for a good man
[34:51] some would even dare to die but God
[34:54] commanded his love toward us and that
[34:57] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[35:00] for us
[35:01] much more than being now justified in
[35:04] his blood we shall be saved from the
[35:07] Wrath through him amen God bless the
[35:09] reading of this word you may be seated
[35:13] amen this morning I'd like to speak on a
[35:15] little topic that I entitled the love of
[35:17] God
[35:18] the love of God and as you read here it
[35:21] says that
[35:24] said because the love of God is shed
[35:26] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[35:28] which is given unto us as in verse 5 for
[35:32] when we were yet without strength and
[35:34] Due Time Christ died for the for the
[35:37] ungodly see Christ loved us so much that
[35:41] he went to Calvary and he died for us
[35:43] amen and he was so gracious and kind and
[35:46] I thought about this topic and when I
[35:48] was thinking about it I I thought about
[35:50] what did he give up for me
[35:53] I thought about what what did Jesus give
[35:55] up for me and I thought about would I be
[35:58] willing to give up what he gave up
[36:00] because I think about when he was in
[36:02] heaven he had everything
[36:04] he had all the riches he had all the
[36:07] glory he had all the honor he had people
[36:09] to worship Him and yet he still decided
[36:12] to come down to earth and die for you
[36:14] and me he decided to give all of that up
[36:16] because he loved me he loved me so much
[36:19] that he said you know what I'm going to
[36:21] go down and I'm going to have people
[36:22] spit on me I'm gonna have people come at
[36:25] me and I'm going to have them say all
[36:27] type of things against me but I love
[36:30] these people so much that I want to give
[36:32] I want to give my life so they don't
[36:34] have to give theirs I want to give them
[36:37] a way of escape from from the Wrath that
[36:39] is to come see that's the love of God
[36:42] that he shows
[36:44] he shows to us and I was just thinking
[36:46] about how much God loved me how much he
[36:50] was willing to give up for me
[36:52] and it says
[36:56] said Jesus laid down his life for the
[36:59] church he laid down his life for us
[37:01] because he loved us he laid down his
[37:04] life because he loved us and I think
[37:06] about how much love that Jesus extended
[37:08] but how much do I extend every day when
[37:12] people arise up against me how much love
[37:14] do I extend can I look past their faults
[37:17] and see that they still need a savior
[37:19] can I look past their faults and see
[37:21] that they still need to meet Jesus they
[37:24] still need to give their life to him and
[37:26] once their life has changed it'll change
[37:27] them it'll change how they approach me
[37:30] but do I have love enough to over to
[37:32] oversee them and say Lord I still love
[37:34] them Lord no matter what they did to me
[37:37] or what they're doing to me I can still
[37:39] love them no man I can Overlook them how
[37:42] they talk to me because I love them I
[37:44] can Overlook how they may demean me and
[37:47] may put me down because I love them and
[37:50] I can do what they said because the best
[37:51] testimony that you can live is your life
[37:54] people may not see what you say to they
[37:56] may may not hear what you say to them
[37:58] but they always will see what you do to
[38:00] them they will always will be watching
[38:02] they always will be looking at you and
[38:04] see how you react and sometimes they
[38:07] will come to test you they will come to
[38:09] test and see if you really got that love
[38:11] that Jesus had they will really come to
[38:13] test you and see if you really have what
[38:16] Jesus had can you overlook what I say to
[38:18] you can you overlook what I do to you
[38:20] can you still treat me the same way when
[38:23] I'm being mean to you when I'm saying
[38:25] all malicious things against you when
[38:27] I'm going behind your back on the job
[38:29] and talking about you and saying that
[38:31] you don't do this and you don't do that
[38:33] can you still treat me the same way can
[38:36] you still go out and say that I love you
[38:38] and I'm going to treat you no matter how
[38:40] you treat me I'm gonna treat you like
[38:42] Jesus treated me
[38:44] see that's the love that surpasses all
[38:46] understanding that's the love that goes
[38:49] beyond what we can imagine what we can
[38:51] think that's the love that Jesus has and
[38:54] he requires that from each and every one
[38:56] of us that's the only way that we're
[38:58] going to make it out of this life we're
[38:59] gonna make it to Heaven it's with that
[39:01] love that he gives to each and every one
[39:03] of us it's that love that goes beyond
[39:05] what we can see it goes beyond what we
[39:09] can feel it goes beyond what we can
[39:11] think it's that love that surpasses all
[39:13] understanding and that's the love that
[39:15] he gives into each one of us if we want
[39:18] it
[39:19] you can't get get what you don't want
[39:22] you can't get what you don't want and if
[39:24] you don't want the love of God you'll
[39:26] never have it you'll never be able to
[39:28] overcome certain things because you
[39:30] don't want the love that Jesus has
[39:32] extended to you each and every day you
[39:34] don't want that love see you said no I
[39:36] don't want what Jesus did for me I don't
[39:39] want the blood that he shed for me Lord
[39:41] I don't want to be forgiven for my sins
[39:44] you don't want that love
[39:46] but God extends it to you each and every
[39:49] day he gives you an opportunity to say I
[39:52] laid down my life for you because I
[39:54] loved you
[39:56] I laid down my life because
[39:58] because I love you
[40:01] and he said and he said if you love me
[40:03] then strengthen your brother you have if
[40:05] you love someone you do whatever you can
[40:07] whatever you can for them whatever they
[40:10] ask for you if you truly love them they
[40:12] ask you and you know that it's not wrong
[40:14] and it's not an unjust act you try to do
[40:17] the best that you can for them I think
[40:19] of a mother and how she sacrifices for
[40:22] her children because she loves them I
[40:24] think of a father because he love them
[40:26] he'll give you good advice he'll tell
[40:28] you you shouldn't do this and you
[40:29] shouldn't do that because of he loves
[40:32] you you may not understand it but if he
[40:34] truly loves you he'll tell you the right
[40:36] things a mother will tell you hey son
[40:39] you shouldn't do this son you shouldn't
[40:41] hang around these people why because she
[40:43] loves you not because she hates your
[40:44] friends not because she hates your
[40:47] company but because she loves you she
[40:49] wants the best for you she said she
[40:51] might tell you hey don't go down this
[40:52] road why because she can see the end
[40:54] before you start she can see it before
[40:57] you get down that road she looking down
[40:59] there and say hey that road gonna lead
[41:00] you to trouble but you can't see it you
[41:03] don't have the experience that she had
[41:05] but because she loves you she tells you
[41:07] she might come grab you by the shoulder
[41:09] and say hey son wake up daughter wake up
[41:12] because you need to see what's coming
[41:14] before you because she loves you and see
[41:17] God loves you even more than that even
[41:20] more than the most that you can ever
[41:22] feel love from a person God loves you
[41:24] even more
[41:25] he said I'll never put more on you than
[41:28] you can bear because he loves you he
[41:30] loves you so much that he said I gave my
[41:33] life for you I made sure that you had a
[41:35] way of Escape I made sure that you have
[41:38] a way of Victory I made sure that you
[41:40] had a path of righteousness before you
[41:42] if you love me then you'll keep my
[41:44] Commandments that's what he said if you
[41:46] love me and said why do we live this
[41:48] life the prophet God said why do we live
[41:50] this life it's because we love him why
[41:53] do we make the sacrifices that we do is
[41:55] because we love them you know why do we
[41:57] do the things that we do is because we
[41:59] love them and there's nothing that can
[42:01] tell you there's no amount of people
[42:03] telling you you should do this you
[42:05] should do that the reason why you should
[42:07] do it is because you love God it's
[42:09] because you said Lord I love you this is
[42:11] why I make the sacrifices this is why I
[42:14] do these things this is why I come to
[42:15] church Lord this is why I worship you is
[42:17] because I love you not because someone
[42:19] tells me you lift your hands praise the
[42:22] lord it's because Lord I love you Lord I
[42:24] love you Lord I love you and Lord I want
[42:26] to give this to you Lord I want to give
[42:29] you the honor Lord I want to give you
[42:31] the praise Lord I want to give you the
[42:33] glory Lord because I love you there's
[42:35] nothing I can do there's nothing I can
[42:37] say but Lord I just love you I love you
[42:40] so much that I want to give this to you
[42:42] I love you so much Lord I want to give
[42:44] it to you see no one has to coerce you
[42:47] to do it no one has to convince you to
[42:50] do it you want to do it because you love
[42:52] God you want to do it because you you
[42:55] you gave your life to him because you
[42:57] love him so much
[42:59] and no matter how much you love them God
[43:01] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[43:04] seek him see you love him so much that
[43:06] God said I'm going to reward you because
[43:08] of what you've done for me he said I'm
[43:11] going to give you more exceedingly
[43:12] abundantly more than you can ask a thing
[43:15] because you love God you can keep his
[43:17] Commandments because you love God
[43:19] there's certain things you won't do
[43:21] there's certain things places that you
[43:24] won't go because you love God because
[43:27] you love them so much and it's not
[43:28] because you because someone told you not
[43:31] to go there you just know that those are
[43:34] not places that the Lord would want you
[43:36] to go those are not things that he would
[43:38] want you to do those are not acts that
[43:40] he would want you to commit because you
[43:42] love him and God will speak to you
[43:45] because you love him and when you get so
[43:47] close to him God I speak to you and say
[43:49] don't do that
[43:51] don't do that don't go around them
[43:53] people stay home don't go around those
[43:56] friends stay home
[43:58] seek me for seek first the kingdom of
[44:00] God and his righteousness and all these
[44:02] things shall be added unto you it's
[44:04] because you love him you get close
[44:06] enough to God that God will start
[44:08] speaking to you he'll start coming in
[44:10] your room and talking to you you'll
[44:12] start leading you and guarding you when
[44:15] the more you love them the closer you'll
[44:16] get to him you'll want to pray you'll
[44:19] want to seek God you don't want to get
[44:21] on your knees you want to study you want
[44:23] to get down and say Lord I got to get
[44:25] the business with you because I love you
[44:27] and Lord I want this to grow stronger
[44:29] and stronger Lord like David said I want
[44:31] my cup to overflow Lord I want this to
[44:34] run over and over and it says in one
[44:37] song writer said the blessings running
[44:39] over and over see God wants she wants
[44:41] you to love him so much that you'll do
[44:43] anything for him whatever he asks you to
[44:46] do you'll do anything for him
[44:49] I think of the story I said God loves
[44:52] people so much and he gave us many
[44:54] examples even though they went through
[44:57] trials and tribulations it was because
[44:59] he loved them I thought of the scripture
[45:02] I said
[45:03] it says in the
[45:05] whom the Lord lovers he chastens
[45:08] see if a parent really love you
[45:10] sometimes they gotta punish you
[45:12] they got to show you hey that was wrong
[45:14] but sometimes telling you wasn't good
[45:16] enough
[45:17] they had to put a punishment on it so
[45:20] that you could really understand how
[45:22] wrong it was it wasn't because they
[45:24] hated you and they they didn't they was
[45:25] all against you and my parents always
[45:27] they hate me and I don't want to see
[45:30] it's because they loved you
[45:32] they loved you so much that they had to
[45:34] punish you so that you could truly
[45:36] understand what you did wrong
[45:38] I said many of times when many times my
[45:41] dad would sit me down before he would
[45:42] punish me and he would tell me this is
[45:44] why it was wrong
[45:45] and he would tell me because he loved me
[45:48] he wanted me to truly understand what I
[45:50] had done wrong and why it was wrong now
[45:53] I still got the punishment because I
[45:55] still needed the punishment but he would
[45:58] tell me because he loved me and he
[46:00] punished me because he loved me see
[46:02] that's the same way that God does when
[46:05] he loves you he takes you through things
[46:07] he takes you through trials and
[46:09] tribulations because he wants you to
[46:11] grow stronger he wants you to get
[46:13] stronger in him because he loves you he
[46:16] takes you through these trials and
[46:18] tribulations and he says I want you to
[46:20] learn these lessons I want you to learn
[46:22] them and sometimes it's not even for you
[46:24] it's so that God can get Glory and so
[46:27] that God they asked the question of the
[46:29] the man that was blind the time they
[46:31] said was it his sin or his parents sin
[46:33] he said neither it was for me to get
[46:36] Glory
[46:37] and see because God loved him so much he
[46:39] wanted to show forth his power he wanted
[46:42] to show forth his might he wanted to
[46:44] show for his glory through this through
[46:47] this testimony and say each one of us
[46:50] have a testimony each one of us we we
[46:52] know where God has brought us from and
[46:55] even if we don't know where it's going
[46:57] to end up we know where God has brought
[46:58] us from said on the saying is someone
[47:01] said that I'm not who I used to be uh
[47:04] not where I used to be I'm not where I
[47:06] want to be but I'm right where God
[47:08] placed me to be
[47:09] say even though because God knows what
[47:12] you need when you need it
[47:14] God knows how much you need when you
[47:16] need it and he knows how to take things
[47:19] off of you when you need it but he says
[47:22] come to me all ye that are heavy laden
[47:24] and I'll give you rest take my yoke upon
[47:27] you and learn to me for our meek and
[47:28] lowly in heart and say he shall give
[47:31] rest for your soul because he loved you
[47:33] he said I'll take your burdens
[47:35] because he loves you he said come and
[47:37] give them to me and I'll carry these
[47:40] loads because he loved you he said I'll
[47:42] I'll help you through what you're going
[47:44] through because he loved you he said I'm
[47:46] going to give you strength to overcome
[47:48] I'm going to give you power to speak the
[47:50] word and these things may happen for you
[47:52] I'm going to give you the the power that
[47:55] I had to create worlds because I loved
[47:57] you because I love you now do you love
[48:00] him in the same way he loves you
[48:03] that's the question I asked do you love
[48:05] God in the same way that he loves you
[48:09] and I asked what sacrifices are you
[48:11] making
[48:13] because he made a great sacrifice for
[48:15] you and I he came down to earth and he
[48:17] said I'm going to take these beatings
[48:20] these whippings these thorns on my head
[48:22] people sticking Spears in my side I'm
[48:26] gonna take this with you
[48:28] now what are you sacrificing
[48:31] do you love them enough to sacrifice
[48:33] something for him do you love him enough
[48:35] to give up something for him do you love
[48:38] him enough to do what he asks you to do
[48:40] it's not a hard life that God gives you
[48:43] it's not a hard thing that he may ask
[48:45] you to do don't do this and he makes it
[48:47] very plain and very clear he he may and
[48:50] he says don't do this and all you have
[48:53] to do is not do it and he said I'll
[48:54] bless you
[48:55] all you have to do is obey his word and
[48:58] he said I'll bless you and the blessings
[49:00] of God is better than any blessings you
[49:02] can ever have you may think someone give
[49:04] you this or give you that but when God
[49:06] blesses you nobody can question the
[49:09] things that God does for you in your
[49:10] life and it's because he loves you that
[49:12] He blesses you it's because he loves you
[49:15] and you love him is why you give up
[49:17] certain things
[49:19] you may give up drinking you may give up
[49:21] smoking but God takes those desires from
[49:24] you because he loves you and you love
[49:26] him you may give up certain things and
[49:28] you may say well this is what puts me in
[49:31] my crowds but what if you lose your
[49:33] crowds God still loves you what if you
[49:36] lose your friends God still loves you
[49:39] what if you lose your parents God still
[49:41] loves you what if you lose your sister
[49:43] and your brother God still loves you
[49:45] when all of those are gone you can
[49:46] always get down on your knees and talk
[49:48] to God say Lord I need you to come by
[49:51] and visit me why because Lord I need to
[49:53] feel that love that love is greater than
[49:56] any feeling that anyone can give you is
[49:58] greater than the love of a parent it's
[50:00] greater than the love of a friend it's
[50:02] greater than the love of a husband and a
[50:04] wife it's the love of God that come that
[50:07] comes and surpasses all understanding
[50:10] but I asked the question do we take
[50:12] advantage of the love of God
[50:14] do we truly take advantage of the love
[50:16] of God that he gives us
[50:19] I said I think of the prodigal son and
[50:22] he chose to get his inheritance early
[50:24] but one day he came to his senses and
[50:27] realized that he had a father that loved
[50:29] him he had a father that loved him he
[50:31] said you know I'm about to eat what the
[50:34] pigs eat
[50:35] but in my father's house they got fooled
[50:39] they got good food and water and good
[50:41] drinks and all this because there was a
[50:43] famine in the land and he got to
[50:45] realizing how much his father loved
[50:47] loved him he Maybe started to think
[50:49] about you know maybe I shouldn't have
[50:51] ran away from home so early
[50:53] maybe I should have stayed he might have
[50:55] thought about his brother who was still
[50:57] there with his father who was still
[50:59] there working continually because he
[51:01] loved his father he said I wanted to get
[51:04] out and do my own thing but where did I
[51:06] lead me
[51:07] where did that lead me when I want to do
[51:09] my whole thing maybe he he might not
[51:11] have realized that when he wanted to do
[51:13] his own thing he left that love behind
[51:15] he left that safety behind there was
[51:18] something that was keeping him it was
[51:20] because his father loved him that he
[51:22] kept him close it was because his father
[51:24] loved him that he had him working he had
[51:26] them doing these things it was because
[51:28] his father loved him but he said I I
[51:30] want to give that up I want to go and do
[51:32] my own thing well he got out there and
[51:35] he did his own thing
[51:36] and he lost all his money he lost all
[51:40] his friends and he realized maybe when
[51:41] he lost his money he didn't have friends
[51:44] maybe he lost his money and he realized
[51:46] hey these friends was only around for
[51:47] what I could give
[51:49] these friends was only around because of
[51:51] what I was doing for them these friends
[51:53] were only around because what I could
[51:55] give them the status maybe the fun times
[51:58] the good times the highs that's all they
[52:01] was around here for where are my real
[52:03] friends when I'm down and out
[52:06] where are my real friends when who are
[52:08] the ones that truly love me when I'm
[52:10] when I don't have nobody when I'm out
[52:12] here working on a farm and in the pig
[52:15] pen where they at now
[52:17] where are they now
[52:19] ask who loves me now but he remembered
[52:22] his father's love
[52:23] he might have remembered his brother and
[52:25] said you know I know that my father
[52:28] still loves me and if I go home right
[52:30] now my father will welcome me amen
[52:33] after all that he had done he realized
[52:36] that a Father's Love had surpassed all
[52:38] that he had done all that he had done
[52:41] all the sin and all the things that he
[52:43] had done that might have been wrong he
[52:45] knew when he walked home to his father
[52:47] his father would welcome him but when he
[52:49] came home he was he had a he had a
[52:51] repentant heart because he realized what
[52:54] he had done he he was saying I'm sorry
[52:57] Dad I'm sorry Father for what I did I'm
[53:00] sorry for leaving you the way that I did
[53:02] Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry for going and
[53:05] doing what I wanted to do he came with a
[53:07] repentant heart and his father welcomed
[53:09] him saw him a far off until prepare the
[53:12] fatty care prepare A Feast for him
[53:14] because my son is coming home and that's
[53:17] the same way God wants to see you he
[53:19] says come home come home because I love
[53:22] you
[53:23] there's so many things I'm keeping and
[53:25] protecting you from because I love you
[53:28] if you love God and you give your life
[53:30] to him God will protect you from things
[53:31] because he loves you as the devil went
[53:34] to God and for job and he said Lord the
[53:37] only reason he he loves you is because
[53:39] you protecting them you got to hedge
[53:41] around them and only if if you let me
[53:44] take these things from him let's see if
[53:46] he really loves you let's see if I take
[53:49] his if I take his cattle if I take his
[53:52] wealth if I take his money if I take let
[53:55] me see I'll take his family from him I
[53:58] cause his wife to turn against them and
[54:00] let's see if he truly love you I'll give
[54:03] him sicknesses and diseases and let's
[54:05] see if he truly loves you the only
[54:07] reason he loves you is because he
[54:09] protecting you and God said you know he
[54:12] knew Job see God knew how much job loved
[54:15] him God knew what was deep down in the
[54:19] inside that maybe you and I cannot see
[54:21] he knew what was deep down greater than
[54:24] any of us could reach he knew what was
[54:26] inside of job he knew how much job loved
[54:29] him
[54:30] and he said and he said you know what
[54:32] I'll let you do everything you want to
[54:34] him just don't take his life
[54:36] just don't take his life so the devil he
[54:39] went out and he said I'm gonna I'm gonna
[54:40] start with this I'm gonna take take his
[54:42] camels and once and I'm gonna slay all
[54:45] his servants but one to let them hear
[54:47] the news you know sometimes you have he
[54:49] may have so much you have so many things
[54:52] and if you misplace one thing you don't
[54:54] you don't worry about it you say I can
[54:55] get something else you get something
[54:57] else but the devil allows someone to
[54:59] come back and tell him what you lost
[55:01] it's different it's different when you
[55:03] don't know about it
[55:05] but the devil allowed him to let him
[55:07] know about it and then he said you know
[55:08] what I'm gonna take his cows and then he
[55:10] let one servant live and come back and
[55:13] tell him about it he and then and then
[55:15] he then he killed his children he let
[55:17] one serpent come back and tell him hey
[55:19] your kid's dead and just imagine how
[55:21] much was on job
[55:23] how much was on job in that moment how
[55:26] much was on show depression
[55:29] the anxiety the depression that Joe Bona
[55:32] went through but yet he held on to God
[55:34] yet he said Lord I love you Lord though
[55:38] they slay me yet I'll Trust You Lord you
[55:40] can take everything from me but yeah I'm
[55:43] still Gonna Love You Lord I'm still
[55:45] going to trust you see job had so much
[55:47] on him and he and he turned and he said
[55:49] he said you know what even when his wife
[55:52] said you should curse your God and die
[55:54] just imagine the person that said that
[55:56] they love you
[55:58] love you more than anyone else the
[56:00] closest person to you said you need to
[56:02] curse your God and just go ahead and die
[56:05] and job said no I still love God more
[56:07] than that Joel friends came against and
[56:10] I said I don't know why you serving that
[56:12] God look what he did to you
[56:15] but because job loved God he didn't
[56:17] listen to any of that he didn't listen
[56:20] to anything that anybody said and after
[56:22] the devil got done he he realized you
[56:25] know this is a true one that loved God
[56:27] this someone that that I can't I took
[56:30] everything I could from him and he still
[56:32] loved God God said are you finished yet
[56:35] and the devil said I ain't got nothing
[56:36] else to do
[56:38] did everything I could do and he still
[56:40] loves you that's a true one that loves
[56:42] you right there how many of us could go
[56:44] through tests like that how many of us
[56:47] could go through half of what Joe went
[56:49] through a quarter what Joe went through
[56:51] and not turned your back on God
[56:55] do you love him that much
[56:57] do you love him that much that you can
[56:59] say Lord Lord if you give me a little
[57:02] testing trial I'm not going to turn
[57:03] around
[57:04] Lord if you give me this sickness I'm
[57:07] still not going to turn around because
[57:09] you said you're the god that healeth
[57:11] Lord you said by your stripes I am
[57:13] healed so Lord even if I'm sick Lord I
[57:16] still love you enough to not turn it
[57:18] around I still love you enough to trust
[57:20] that you working all this to my good I
[57:23] still love you enough the Lord You're
[57:24] gonna bring me out Lord I know that
[57:26] you're going to deliver me Lord I know
[57:28] you're going to take me through because

[57:31] even if I can't understand why Lord I
[57:35] still love you Lord I still will trust
[57:37] you see job trust in them enough to keep
[57:39] going despite of what everyone was
[57:41] saying around them job loved them enough
[57:44] to keep going when no one else would
[57:46] would would uplift them or hold them up
[57:49] he had to trust in the love that he had
[57:52] in God and do you know if the story
[57:54] continues that God gave him double what
[57:56] he lost
[57:57] because he loved God God loved him so
[58:01] much he said you know I know the end
[58:02] from the beginning and I'm only giving
[58:04] him what he can bear because he said I
[58:06] can't put more on you than you can bear
[58:08] and God knew what job could bear God

[58:13] me yet I'll trust you because I love you

[58:45] love for you it'll cause me to grow
[58:47] stronger in you see that's the love that
[58:50] he that he has for me I think of just a
[58:53] small thing of what is sacrificed for me
[58:56] he came from Heaven he didn't have to do
[58:59] that and even when he got to Earth he
[59:02] still didn't have to die
[59:03] he could have came to Earth and saw him
[59:05] like you know what these people are too
[59:07] Wicked I'm gonna just destroy them but
[59:09] he still didn't do that he still went to
[59:12] Calvary he still went to that cross he
[59:15] still shattered his blood he still went
[59:17] down and he went in that grave he went
[59:19] down to Hell defeated the devil came
[59:21] back up and rose again all because he
[59:24] loved me all because even though he knew
[59:27] that I would have my sins and my
[59:28] situations he still loved me he still
[59:31] died and he still shattered his blood
[59:33] because he loved me
[59:35] and when you realize how much God has
[59:37] done for you when you realize all the
[59:40] things that he sacrificed for you all

[1:01:43] testimony but I got my own I know where
[1:01:46] God has brought me from I know what God
[1:01:48] has brought me through I know what God
[1:01:51] has taken me through and I can't turn
[1:01:53] around now I can't go back from Once I
[1:01:56] came because God's been too good to me
[1:01:59] God been too good to me
[1:02:01] we were listening yesterday about some
[1:02:04] of the testimonies that some of the
[1:02:05] brothers had and some of the sisters had
[1:02:07] of how good God has meant to him
[1:02:10] and think about all the things he
[1:02:12] brought you through because he loves you
[1:02:15] because he loved you he gave his life
[1:02:18] for you and he gave you an opportunity
[1:02:20] this morning to say Lord I want you to
[1:02:23] repent of my sins and give my life to
[1:02:26] you and if you and if and if you walked
[1:02:28] away from God he gave you a way to come
[1:02:30] back to him
[1:02:31] say Lord I want to give you everything
[1:02:34] that you gave to me because Lord that's
[1:02:36] just a small small spot part of what you
[1:02:40] gave for me
[1:02:41] see he sacrificed so much
[1:02:44] and he asked us for so little
[1:02:47] he sacrificed so much that he asked us
[1:02:49] for so little
[1:02:51] we think about our life and we say man I
[1:02:54] only got a shorts man to live and I want
[1:02:56] to do my thing
[1:02:58] see that see that prodigal son he
[1:03:00] thought the same thing said I I only got
[1:03:03] this much time and I want to get my
[1:03:05] inheritance and do what I want to do
[1:03:08] but when he got done he realized he was
[1:03:10] left with nothing
[1:03:11] he realized that what it was only for a
[1:03:14] season
[1:03:15] his pleasure was only for a season
[1:03:18] and he started thinking about that
[1:03:20] father that loved him he started
[1:03:22] thinking about that father that loved
[1:03:24] him and that father that would do
[1:03:26] anything for him because he was his son
[1:03:28] that father that would give anything for
[1:03:31] him because he was as he was his son and
[1:03:34] he said you know I got to go back to my
[1:03:36] father's house
[1:03:37] I'm going to return to my father's house
[1:03:40] and when he came he said father forgive
[1:03:42] me forgive me for my wrong forgive me
[1:03:45] for what I've done and said I'm coming
[1:03:47] back because I know that you love me I
[1:03:50] know that you love me no matter what
[1:03:52] I've done you I know that you love me
[1:03:54] and Lord you're going to forgive me for
[1:03:56] what I've done and you're going to take
[1:03:58] me in now when he got back don't be like

[1:04:03] father and he's like why are you
[1:04:04] welcoming him back I've been here all
[1:04:06] this time and I ain't got what he got
[1:04:09] and the father turned to him and he said
[1:04:12] do you not understand all that I have
[1:04:14] is yours
[1:04:16] all that I have is yours and that's what
[1:04:19] God wants to give you so he can turn to
[1:04:21] you and say all that I have is yours
[1:04:24] all that I have is yours and he asks
[1:04:27] that you give your life to him that he
[1:04:30] may do what he wants to do with your
[1:04:31] life
