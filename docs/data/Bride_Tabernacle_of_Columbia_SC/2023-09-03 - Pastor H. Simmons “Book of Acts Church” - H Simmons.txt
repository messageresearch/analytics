Bright Tabernacle I almost wanted to tell him to come and sing for us they look like they can sing by the grace of God maybe I won't put him on the spot maybe next time well thank God for them Cameron and all of you that come this morning and we appreciate Jesus amen to love the Lord he heard My Cry amen those that are listening we thank you for listening in this morning in Jesus name we're going to go to the book of Acts the second chapter thank God for sister lawyers and with Gordon and all the musicians we thank God for y'all amen all of you that sing thank God for you huh I believe you're in the right channel this morning praise God from glory to glory he's changing how about you amen we're changing to his image into his likeness are you with me Acts 2 and 1 let us just bow our heads for a moment father in Jesus name may you cause the fire to get a hold to the word Lord for you said the letter kill it but the spirit give life May the spirit give life to the word this morning and God may you forgive us or anything said or no no thought that is not pleasing in your sight and Lord may you heal the sick save the laws restore the backslider meet the needs of your people in Jesus name amen and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place can it happen this morning can we get on one Accord and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind and it fill all the house where they were setting and they were appeared unto them clothed in tongues like as a fire and it's set upon each of them and they were all filled with the what you feel this morning that's the question it's all right to be in church it's all right to be called a Christian but how you feel they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance may God bless you read his words you may receive it I want to talk this morning concerning a book of Acts Church you know a church without powers is hopeless people amen when you look at the church this morning you're not looking at the building you're not looking at the uh the preacher you're looking at individuals the church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ in other words it's a mystery to the world Amen but Christ is revealed in you as individuals so Christ is the mystery of God revealed and you're the manifestation of Christ's revealed are you with me I said let my life be a manifestation of his life are you up there if my life amen let it dovetail together let it match amen the life that Jesus amen lived while he was on the earth made that same life be manifested in my life are you with me because sometimes just being a Christian is uh just coming to church and maybe John in the church whether amen you must be born again so I'm saying a book of Acts Church the Bible says in Acts 1 and 8 and after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall have what power praise God if you don't have power in your life you can come to church and go through the motion you're wasting time you're wasting time just coming to church and saying I'm gonna I'm a traditional believer I just come to church and I sat right back and I just relax because I want the preacher to put me in heaven I want the church to place me in heaven but you got to know who you are amen a church without power amen it's not a book of Acts Church an individual without power the devil'll whip you amen but when you got power and authority and you know amen that's greater is he that's are you a man but don't you amen just come and say I'm going through the motion I go to church I go to Broad Tabernacle I go to this one I go to now and then that will make a difference the devil don't care nothing about that but whether or not you got the power of God in your life are you filled with the Holy Ghost do you have the fire of God I'm saying Lord what can I do what can I say as I was praying this morning and I said God Amen are we missing it uh are we getting the message over oh are we just going through the motion we can amen play on the instruments and we can walk you up into emotional thrill but if you're not feel the thrill of don't we are you with me amen we don't want to be worked up emotionally but we want something amen we want to be sealed amen he said grieve not the holy spirit of God what about your seal amen we want to be sealed we want to be filled and sealed amen we want something that amen that when you leave out of this building that you still got the fire praise God the Fire won't go out are you up there see John say there's one coming after me whose shoes I'm not worth it or lose amen he should baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire praise God come on somebody do you want fire the Holy Ghost Fire come on you got to say something don't just sit here and stare at me you gotta say I want the fire open your mouth I didn't hear you look at somebody to say I didn't hear you know don't be afraid to Let It Go ask him do you want the fire do you want it you're scared of it are you scared it's not gonna burn you like that it's going to do you do it it burns friend out amen better get rid of the devil you ought to get rid of together Amen Let the Fire Burn in you don't have to fight your battle gotta fight for you are you with me you know you know you know Max for the devil anyway amen isn't that right why don't you let the fire come God I need your fire God I want to fire you I want you to burn say it out of me let me put out that old death amen before he goes to the Lake of Fire I want the fire to be glory to God I want the fire in me are you with me Hallelujah the Bible tells us that the second death is the Lake of Fire you know right and the devil knows that he has a destination the devil knows where he's going amen praise God but you need amen the devil don't have to dwell in your life are you up there the devil knows he has about a short time and he knows his destiny that he already fell and even though he goes back and forward up to heaven to accuse the Brethren the devil is telling a lie amen he's saying that you're not gonna make it that you don't want God that you don't need God but you tell a devil he's a liar I want God I need God praise God Hallelujah that's somebody going to take hold to the word and they're going to manifest amen a book of that church God's gonna have a a a church that's full of the Holy Ghost God's going to have a paper that I want sex still and I won't stand by until something happened in my life praise God you know where you were when he found you amen praise God the drugs might have had the alcohol might have had you whatever had you won't have you no more why because of the fire come praise God you know we go through the motion we go to church and we don't really amen we don't really get the fire like we need since see sometimes we just get happy and we speak in tongues and then the devil still take advantage of us because tongue is the least of all gifts are you with me praise God he said no I speak with the tongues of men and angels and I have not charity and profit me nothing isn't that right praise God but uh it's blah amen if you got love the love of God is God are you with me God is what love and if we got the love of God inside of us it's the power amen over all the gifts of all the enemy because God is love when you he said that experience hope hope makes the not a shame because the Holy Ghost amen accept the love of God is shattered abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost without the holy ghost coming you're not going to have a god pay love you you might have feel your love you might have the love that the world have and love that a husband have for a wife but you're going to have God pay love that's the victory amen that's God's love when you get God to love it only comes through the baptism of the Holy Ghost are you with me but if you don't want the Holy Ghost you don't want the fire of God you don't want the power of God in your life you just want to come to church I just want enough of God just to come to church I just want to know for God to stop drinking and stop smoking like I just want to knock a God to say that I'm all right to make my conscience feel a little better I want all that God has for me praise God I'll tell you it came to a point in my life amen I I knew I couldn't live right are you with me I was a teenager but I I wanted Jesus amen I wanted God in my life amen I didn't want to come to church and go through the motions because I saw what church folks did amen I saw those ones today they said they had the Holy Ghost and how they live but I didn't want that kind of life amen I came Amen to Jesus and I wanted something that's real I wanted a God Amen to have power [Applause] praise God I worked in the hospital you know what I was doing I'm playing hand on the sea in the name of Jesus because I want to know I wanted to try out this new found power

your head up but it made your heart got to be right your heart got to be right you got to be right with God you you can do things for us but your heart got to be right you want to be somebody big in the status of men or do you want the power of God and be humble with them thank God lord I want your power the power of God is manifested in humility it's not with those who walk around I'm Bishop so and so on I'm Apostles so and so on y'all got to hear me like they can put you in heaven or hell they can't do it amen they don't have authority to put you in heaven or hell amen the word of God has already amen told us our destiny are you with me if you abide in me and my word abided you you can ask what you will and he said I was I'll do it isn't that right but what as I said in the funeral yesterday it's all about your believing if you believe you can have but if you don't believe you can't have it you know I asked a question in the funeral yesterday who won't everlasting life who wants life who wants eternal life it's a lot of young people my heart went out because I could see so many young people some of them you know I I you know they had all kind of problems people were hurting in the funeral are you with me but who wants eternal life it doesn't matter how bad your heart but do you want to heal it do you want God do you want to change do you want somebody that can help you somebody that cares about you somebody that loves you it's hard to make that decision whether or not I want to move amen out of my condition I want to hold on to this world and it's good I'm going to hold on to the things of this life but do I want God see I as I said I said I'm tired of just going through the motion I'm tired of people coming to church and saying they got no victory are you a man

need your power I need you Lord oh you're so sad you're so sad look at you you're so pitiful Beyonce oh Beyonce sing one of those songs and you saw she said was cool you know what I'm saying but when it comes down to Jesus the Bible says there's no Beauty we should desire him amen when we see him amen we hear this that we're our faces from him because he's the word are you with me in the beginning was the word the words with God in the word what's God and the Word was made flesh and duet Among Us he was in the world the world was made by him but the word didn't know who he was and I said do you know who Jesus is he's the one that created the heavens and earth amen he's the one that died for your sins he's the one that loves you and cares about you but I don't mean much his blood will never lose its power his blood would never lose his power but though his blood would never lose his power it's a possibility that we don't have his power because we don't acknowledge his blood are you a man we don't have his power because we don't amen see the power of the blood the blood of Jesus has power to take away all guilty stains all that we have ever done the blood of Jesus is able to wash us why did it snow are you up man it's because you know what the Holy Ghost is the life of the flesh is in the blood the Holy Ghost is the life that was in the blood coming back on the believer are you with me the life that was in the blood in the blood of Jesus that life that was in that blood amen came back on the day of Pentecost are you with me I'm talking about a book of Acts the church a church that amen that's got the literate life of God inside of them I'll talk about it's not any kind of life it's Zoe little sister told me that her name was Zoe I said you know what your name means

draw like him Beethoven you can compose like he did are you with me if God I'm gonna tell you if you get the the life of a dove you couldn't eat what the buzzards did oh you want me if you get the

live by what bread alone bye-bye every word that proceeded out of the water I want I want God's word that's what I want to feed off the word I want the word of God I don't want all of this other stuff amen all this other stuff is all right but I want to worry he said he that believeth on me I have to walk scripture then out of his balance your flow are you with me do you want Living Water you want something that's praise God Hallelujah stagnated something that's in a trough amen next stagnated water where the mosquitoes and all kind of stuff in it or do you want Living Water different like an Artesian well amen praise God flowing bubbling are you up man you ought to want something that's what amen won't go dry amen but I'm afraid that what we had is dried up the god that we say we had is dried up and it's not oh Hallelujah bubbling anymore I'm saying that the god that you supposed to have it ought to be like a well of water spraying up in the everlasting life Hallelujah I'm gonna tell you something the Holy Ghost Fire you can't put it out praise God hallelujah you can't put it out you can't burn it and then you can't stop it out you can kill me but you can't put my fire off

that you've been formulated in your mind and popped there by our spirit they're causing you to be discouraged because he done spoke to you and told you amen you ain't this and you you're not that you you know and you just listen and listen until it takes you down in the dump praise God but I'm going to tell you something I'm not going to let that devil lie to me praise God hallelujah [Applause] you know when I I came to that point in my life I'm so busy in church looking at what folks did I can see the preacher I said man that preaching ain't nobody hypocrite even in late years somebody wrote a book until the preacher was as big you know he was a big Bishop he's a big adulteress but I saw that when I was a teenager I thought when I went to church looking I was a mama the bishop ain't right Mama said you all know what you're talking about son you had a friend she said oh yeah I couldn't help from what I was seeing I wasn't blind I was looking right at him you know what I'm saying

ain't it he'll make sure you see all the Hypocrites and make sure you overlook yourself amen you don't serve God because of all good people you see you serve God because he's been real to you your relationship is not with those people your relationship is with God and mama told me something that was real it doesn't matter what those other folks do is you and God what you do so I had to listen to Mama talk to me tell me but it wasn't until God got a hold of me are you with me God got a hold of me it didn't make no difference what I saw in others because that wasn't going to stop me for serving God are you they wasn't going to stop me because God was real to me amen God had proved himself to me I know I needed God and I know I needed help and I know I didn't want to go down the road
