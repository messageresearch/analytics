[35:05] set free by the power of the Holy Ghost
[35:08] in the name of Jesus Christ for we thank
[35:11] you Lord in Jesus name Amen
[35:17] the book of Proverbs
[35:20] the third chapter the first verse she
[35:27] says my son forget not my law
[35:34] let thy heart keep my Commandments for
[35:43] strength of days and long life and peace
[35:47] shall they add to thee let not nursey
[35:53] and truth for safety bind them about my
[35:57] neck and write them upon the table of
[36:00] that heart so shalt thou find favor and
[36:06] good understanding in the sight of God
[36:11] and man trust in the Lord with all thine
[36:16] heart lean not tonight on understanding
[36:21] and all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[36:25] shall direct thy path be not wise in our
[36:30] own eyes fear the Lord and depart from
[36:33] evil it shall be held to thy navel and
[36:37] marrow to their bone honor the Lord with
[36:41] our substance and with the first-fruit
[36:45] of all that increase so shall thy barns
[36:48] be filled with plenty and our pressure
[36:52] burst out with new wine trust in the
[36:58] Lord with all thine heart god bless to
[37:02] renew his words you may be seated
[37:05] praise God amen trust in the Lord with
[37:10] all thine heart in times like these we
[37:19] can trust in many things but the subject
[37:23] this morning is trust in the law so many
[37:29] times we heard many
[37:30] see that on the American dollar money it
[37:36] says trust in God in god we trust in god
[37:47] we trust' but is that a reality is that
[37:51] just something we put on our money that
[37:56] we trust in god we trust' i want to know
[38:03] this morning is that reality is that
[38:07] just so common saying In God We Trust
[38:14] let's think about it do we really trust
[38:16] him here it says trust in the law with
[38:23] all not just trust him with some we're
[38:27] trusting the Lord with all thine heart
[38:30] another thing he said he said in lean
[38:33] not to thy I believe the problem with In
[38:38] God We Trust and trusting in the Lord I
[38:42] believe many lean to their own
[38:45] understanding and he axes us not to lean
[38:50] to our own understanding just a little
[38:55] bit before we you know really got into
[38:58] the message this morning want to reflect
[39:01] on some things as we were praying we've
[39:04] had flesh and red lights of the coming
[39:08] of the Lord and because there's so many
[39:12] times God has put stop signs and gives
[39:17] us opportunity to they meant to turn
[39:20] back to him and turn from wickedness and
[39:23] evil and turn back to God so many signs
[39:27] of we've had storms and earthquakes we
[39:30] had all kind of things that happen that
[39:33] God says Amen there are I'm coming amen
[39:40] we recognize as
[39:43] the prophet of God talked about the
[39:44] signs of the time aim and he talked
[39:48] about a wicked and adulterous generation
[39:50] amen
[39:51] and how they can discern the face of the
[39:54] sky and they know whether his fire
[39:56] wealth or farewell though but he meant
[39:59] the signs of the time they don't seem to
[40:01] understand and I believe that there was
[40:06] a question axe in my fuse 24 Amen they
[40:10] asked Jesus amen when shall the end come
[40:15] amen is just the end of time and we've
[40:18] also many times folks have prophesied
[40:21] and predicted that the end of time was
[40:24] that a near amen round in 1900 so we had
[40:28] those that they meant went forth and
[40:31] said at the turn of the 19-hundred sin
[40:34] said the end of the world was prevalent
[40:36] we said in year 2000 it's at the end of
[40:39] the world will see so many a time we
[40:43] have come and will face the end well one
[40:50] look like it all was gonna oval be over
[40:53] with then world war two we will face
[40:56] what the world coming to it is in and
[40:59] it's been so many times that I write war
[41:03] amen went on it was going on it looks
[41:07] like all nations came together and
[41:10] looked like we were coming to the time
[41:11] of the end then so we had flashing red
[41:15] lights of the end time and the end
[41:17] coming he meant we've had all kind of
[41:20] things when the bombs was dropped on in
[41:23] Japan in the block it was all over the
[41:26] world had come to his end amen and we
[41:30] realized that the world that we know now
[41:32] is falling apart
[41:34] and I thought about the a mental or I'm
[41:37] all the king's horses and all the king's
[41:40] men could not put Humpty Dumpty together
[41:43] again and I'll say it all the king's
[41:47] horses and all the king's men they meant
[41:50] won't be able to put this world that's
[41:53] fallen apart together again
[41:55] so brothers and sisters we ought not to
[41:58] trust in our own ability for he said
[42:02] lean not that I own understanding and I
[42:06] want you to know if he meant without
[42:08] then are you ready for what's next
[42:12] amen are you ready for the end amen
[42:16] they've put all this over with and it's
[42:18] all come to his end now are you ready
[42:22] and if you not ready then I trust he
[42:29] meant that you would get ready because
[42:33] we're at a junction a junction of time
[42:39] as God's servants say we're at a
[42:41] junction amen and that disjunction amen
[42:44] sometimes we come to crossroads and at
[42:47] that cross world we must make a decision
[42:50] so we had a junction amen that decisions
[42:53] has to be made we were at a place in a
[42:58] min American history that they met the
[43:01] Congress and the President and everybody
[43:03] had to come together see can we stop the
[43:06] crisis that we're here what can we do to
[43:09] the financial a mint situation than the
[43:12] stock market and all that is going on
[43:14] can we hold it together
[43:16] can we just hold on a little while
[43:18] longer they meant but I'm saying to you
[43:22] amen praise God thank God for all those
[43:26] that are instrumental in doing
[43:29] Amen all that they can do amen but it's
[43:31] gonna take more than what they're doing
[43:34] amen to hold things together it's gonna
[43:37] take God and I'm saying trust in the
[43:41] Lord
[43:42] so by the grace of God we want to pray
[43:45] for them and we want to pray to God in
[43:48] Wrath we'll remember Marcia realize and
[43:51] then amen at this particular crisis time
[43:54] he meant we need to trust God they meant
[43:58] we needed amen we need to turn our
[44:00] hearts and our tension in our mind to
[44:03] the war
[44:05] is able to deliver that is able to help
[44:10] us trust in the Lord but I believe
[44:15] sometimes when trouble call me men men
[44:19] return a meteo all types of solutions he
[44:26] meant I remember when a men saw was in
[44:30] the king he meant and he couldn't find
[44:33] any healthy men look like God was not
[44:38] hearing him because his spiritual
[44:40] backslidden condition and he turned to
[44:43] the wits of India amen which called up
[44:50] Samuel the Prophet and Sam you're told
[44:54] so you're gonna be with me tomorrow at
[44:56] this time he meant I want you to know
[45:00] amen
[45:00] people are turned when they get
[45:02] desperate Amen praise God my son said it

[45:08] sister had fixed him something to eat
[45:13] Calloway thought good he said to her

[45:19] hungry man to eat anything
[45:30] normally do when out of desperation will

[45:43] desperation with God I know God can help
[46:02] America God can help the world if the
[46:05] world would tend to God amen I believe
[46:08] that Jesus they make cares about us no
[46:12] matter what the conditions are no matter
[46:16] how the troubles
[46:18] in the builders role I believe God still
[46:20] cares in trusting in the Lord with all
[46:28] that heart I believe many have come to
[46:32] the point but it's not something new
[46:36] because in that we might be going
[46:40] through things right now but the Bible
[46:43] says the Solomon says there's nothing
[46:45] new Under the Sun I believe perilous
[46:48] times have come before they met and I
[46:52] believe that folks have experienced they
[46:55] met these days before in different times
[46:59] and different times in history to point
[47:02] back to the eighteen hundreds and talks
[47:04] about the plague that hit then and then

[49:04] confident that we have a God that's
[49:07] concerned about us and that he cares in
[49:09] spite of what we are going through in
[49:12] spite infirmities and in spite of our
[49:18] fliction God still cares
