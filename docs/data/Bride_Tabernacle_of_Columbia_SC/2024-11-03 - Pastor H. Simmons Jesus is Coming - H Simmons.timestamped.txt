[35:47] now in Jesus name
[35:51] amen book of 2
[35:54] Thessalonians 3 and
[35:56] 4 2 Thessalonians 3 and
[35:59] 4 familiar passage of scriptures
[36:03] with I believe with all my heart that
[36:06] Jesus is coming
[36:10] amen and we see signs all over the place
[36:13] sometime Jesus is coming perhaps they've
[36:16] been saying that over 2,000 years or
[36:20] more that Jesus is
[36:24] coming I think it's later than we think
[36:27] it is
[36:29] is we see the signs of the
[36:33] time these says
[36:37] here second
[36:40] Peter excuse second Peter excuse me
[36:43] three second Peter
[36:49] 3 I said 2
[36:52] Thessalonians second Peter 3 and
[36:56] 4 and saying where is the promise of his
[36:59] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[37:02] all things continued as it were from the
[37:04] beginning of creation for this they're
[37:07] willingly ignorant of that by the word
[37:09] of God the heavens been of old and the
[37:11] Earth standed out of the water and in
[37:13] the water whereby the world that then
[37:16] was being overflooded with water perish
[37:19] but the heavens and earth which are now
[37:21] by the same word are kept in Store
[37:23] Reserve and Def fire against the day of
[37:26] judgment and prediction of ungodly men
[37:31] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[37:35] thing that one day is with the Lord is
[37:39] as a what th years and a thousand years
[37:42] as one the Lord is not slight
[37:47] concerning his what
[37:50] promise as some men count slackness but
[37:54] his longsuffering to us were not willing
[37:57] that any should what perish but that all
[38:00] should come to what repentance but the
[38:03] day of the Lord will come as a what
[38:05] thief in the night thief in the night in
[38:08] which the heavens shall pass away with a
[38:11] great what noise and the elements should
[38:13] melt with the fervent what he and the
[38:17] Earth also and the works that are
[38:21] therein shall be what burned up seeing
[38:24] then that all these things shall be
[38:29] dissolved what man of person ought
[38:33] ye ought ye to be in all holy
[38:36] conversation and godliness looking for
[38:40] and hasten until the what coming of the
[38:42] day of God where in the heavens being on
[38:46] fire shall be dissolved and the elements
[38:49] shall met with
[38:50] what nevertheless we according to his
[38:54] promise look for what new heav new
[38:58] where in dwelleth righteousness amen
[39:01] amen God bless the's word you may be
[39:04] seated
[39:05] amen amen I I know what I'm looking
[39:09] for
[39:10] amen praise God the world is not looking
[39:13] for Jesus to come but I am anticipating
[39:17] the coming of the
[39:19] Lorden and because he's coming back amen
[39:24] we got to prepare ourselves for his
[39:26] coming amen now in Revelation uh 1 and 7
[39:34] it talks about you know a lot of uh
[39:38] Bible teachers talk about the appearance
[39:41] and talk about the presence and the
[39:44] parac and so forth and they're talking
[39:47] about the coming of the Lord in
[39:48] different forms you know and uh but by
[39:52] the grace of God whether it's it's
[39:54] appearance uh is he's here
[39:58] amen well one thing I know a lot of
[40:01] people are
[40:02] skeptical about uh God in Jesus and all
[40:06] but one thing I know he
[40:09] came amen now whether they're Muslims
[40:13] whether they're Hindus or whether they
[40:16] he had an impact on the whole
[40:19] world Jesus
[40:22] came now some uh the Muslim would say he
[40:26] just a prophet
[40:28] and they don't believe he's the son of
[40:30] God and they don't believe he was born
[40:32] of a virgin amen they believe he was
[40:34] just a man but nevertheless that being
[40:39] what that he did
[40:41] come amen and some people are confused
[40:45] amen and if he come he promis that he's
[40:47] coming
[40:49] again isn't that right as he departed he
[40:53] told his disciples don't let your heart
[40:55] be troubled amen believe in God believe
[40:58] also in me for In My Father's House in
[41:01] my father's Palace of many in my father
[41:04] Kingdom of many palaces amen if it were
[41:07] not so I would have told you I go to
[41:11] what I'm going to prepare a place for
[41:15] you that where I am amen there you may
[41:20] be
[41:21] also amen he's
[41:23] coming he's coming and is soon coming
[41:27] came amen amen when he came the first
[41:30] time amen they said the amen that he was
[41:34] King of the Jews amen but he didn't come
[41:38] Amen to be king he came to be a
[41:41] sacrifice and to be offered up for the
[41:44] sins of the world amen amen are you with
[41:47] me amen but yet they thought that his
[41:50] coming was amen not as son of David some
[41:54] cried son of David because they knew
[41:57] that one day the son of David going to
[41:59] come and they look for that one to come
[42:02] to rule with a rod of iron amen amen
[42:06] they uh they said of the increase of his
[42:09] govern government and of his kingdom
[42:11] there shall be no end so they look to
[42:14] master at this time will you restore the
[42:17] kingdom to Israel will you amen
[42:20] reestablish the kingdom that Israel
[42:23] Haden so they look for the millennium
[42:27] but he came Amen to die on the cross for
[42:30] the sins of the world why they look for
[42:33] a lion he came as a lamb amen amen some
[42:38] folks amen thinking that he's going to
[42:41] forever be amen priest and mediator and
[42:45] intercessor but one day he's going to
[42:47] come as judge amen Jesus is coming amen
[42:52] amen some will look for his Mercy amen
