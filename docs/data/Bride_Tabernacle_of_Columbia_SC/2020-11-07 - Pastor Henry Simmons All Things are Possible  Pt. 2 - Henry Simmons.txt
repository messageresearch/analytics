lord for each and every one thank god for the songs and worship tonight we want to say um praise god we're going to miss mother tate and praying for the tate family and and brother derek's mother sister powell she's you know she's been through a lot and she's um we want to pray for her she's in the hospital and going through i think a stroke again i think she said let's pray for sister powell's brother derek's mother and let's just pray for the different ones i want to correct something i said concerning sister takeisha lee of about sighted nerves it said i said it was no cure and that wasn't correct that she didn't say there was no cure she just said there's things you can do and it could pass away but by the grace of god nevertheless we thank god for touching us and healing us amen but we appreciate you know just letting us know that i'm about that so god bless you let us stand hallelujah father we thank you tonight lord for your mercy and grace we thank you for what you do and how you do it we thank you lord god for the grace that you've given us lord it's late in the evening the sun gone down so many soldiers are battling the country's in our role the earth is

for the tate family we pray for mother powell lord lord we pray for shema and different ones lord god the afflictions of the lord pray that you continue to touch bodies touch lives comfort the bereaved lord move in your own special way god help us tonight help us to draw closer to you in jesus name we pray amen the book of matthew 28. sometimes we don't emphasize enough concerning the devil being defeated because that's one thing the devil would like to keep it away from us and he don't want us to realize that he is a defeated foe and he don't want us to really anchor our faith in the knowledge amen that the devil cannot do us any harm because he cannot cross the bloodline and so by the grace of god let us look at matthew 28 and 16 then the 11 disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted and jesus came and speak unto them saying all power is given me given unto me in heaven and in earth all power was given unto me in heaven and in earth by the grace of god jesus tonight got all power let us be seated jesus tonight got all power and if jesus have all power then what's left for the devil so i want to say the devil to you and i we understand that the devil has been stripped has been disarmed and the devil is defeated tonight because jesus said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me let me pick up a little bit where i left off on sunday uh revelation 1. and i believe he really wants the church to understand and to know that the keys in authority the prophet of god tells us when the witcher endo called samuel up from the dead and saul consulted with the witch because he couldn't get his prayer through to god so he went to which to the witch you know the prophet god said when people get desperate enough they eat out the garbage can they get hungry enough you know when you really desiring the supernatural in the power of god and the reality of god people are searching for the real god and they want to see the supernatural inaction and that's why so many people are going to meditation and going to all different types of uh eastern religions and all of that because they're seeking for a meditation there so they they got spirit guides and demon powers being led by them amen not realizing the consequences of that but the devil is defeated brother and sister amen i said we can go to jesus we can go to jesus but because the saw backslidden condition and the spiritual condition he was in amen you know instead of repenting and still uh you know david amen realized that he had made a mistake and what he had done was wrong he said i acknowledge my transgression little a lot of folks trying to get a hold of god but they can't get a hold of god because he meant they haven't left off the wicked stuff amen we must really amen uh surrender our lives totally to god we just can't come half-stepping and halfway to god we got a total surrender to god [Music] are you with me we want to see god's power we want to see the supernatural it's like pilate they slapped jesus said uh uh you know show us a miracle you know do something i mean they wanted to see a miracle they want to see god do something but look at them for what for sports for play and satan said that jesus if you be the son of god he didn't have to prove anything to the devil neither do you and i have to prove anything to the devil your very life ought to be a testimony of who you are are you with me so you let your life speak for you somebody said may the works i've done speak for me amen if jesus is living his life through you then you don't have to speak for yourself so many times we have to defend ourselves but you don't have to defend yourself when you're right are you with me it doesn't matter how many people he said they said uh the jesus what is truth amen jesus knew that he was the way the truth in the life and no man can come to the father but by him he knew he was he didn't have to prove amen to those his adversaries who he was amen the devil said we know thee who thou art are the son of god amen when they cried out allegiance said why you come to ten minutes before the time the demons recognized but men they didn't recognize who jesus was the bible said the devil bleed but he trembles are you with me and oftentimes amen if cain would have done right then god says you do what your brother evil did and you do right god's gonna bless you you know instead of folks doing right they want to accuse evil and they want to amen don't want to repent and come and say god i'm sorry and i want to do that which is right in your sight and i want to please you lord instead of pleasing the lord folks are so ready to amen want god to give respect to what they've given him are you with me and god said if you do right amen if not sin lies at the door oh you want me but folks want god to say amen what you've given me is all right and god said i don't want it it's not pleasing in my sight brother and sister we can't give up god anything think god's gonna say amen he's pleased with it i think god's gonna vindicate your life when you do it all kind of crooked and blasphemy stuff don't look for the supernatural don't look for god to come down and vindicate you but cain got upset with god and he hated his brother marvel not that we didn't tear it's got to go grow together in the same field amen knowing that it's two vines the true vine and the false fire are you with me brother sister amen but i want you to know the devil is defeated you just stand still and you'll watch god amen he said leave it alone in harvest time he sent forth the dangers and he'll do the separation ain't that right so why amen can we not understand that god knows what he's doing and god knows how to take care of business when his time come are you up here so brother and sister's best for you and i ain't meant to do what god has required of us as individuals let's do right let's do the thing that we know that god is requiring of us as individuals as christians amen somebody said well god why did you accept evil and you don't set mine what god says that's my business that's not the part of power over the clay you know oftentimes i say look like what david did was it was it was very bad he sent your eyes on the battlefield put him out there first i mean let him get killed i took his wife committed adultery did all of that stuff saul brought back a guy the king and uh some of some animals and so forth now to you to the average man eyes and looking at the word you don't have a right to judge what how god does things you say well look at what david did that god let and said david is a man after my own heart i'm gonna tell you brother and sister god can do what he wants has not the power powder power over the clay to make one vessel to honor another the dishonor can the things form say that he did him that form why has thou met you know god can do what he wants brother sister he said concerning uh esau and jacob before the children that were born he said he saw have i hated and jacob have a love but look at it look at the character jacob lying taking his brother oh goodness doing all kind of little deceitful stuff but one day god knew he was going to meet he was going to get desperate about god god knew amen that one day jacob was going to come amen and he was going to wrestle with the angel until he got a breakthrough with god [Music] god knew that amen brother and sister amen emmett you do the right things you live the right kind of life and don't try to figure out amen god each and every one of us got an individual journey and god's gonna amen god's gonna require what he gave you or john are you with me before he said it's not him the will it to him that run it but it's god that shows the mercy are you with me so thank god for his mercy tonight thank god for having mercy on us he didn't have to do it but he did thank god for loving us the way he does thank god for caring about us and getting us out of the condition that we were in if it wasn't for the mercy of the good lord where would we be but it was because the good lord had mercy on us praise god amen so don't try to figure out god with all your figuring don't try to figure him out revelation 1 and 17 it says and when i saw him i fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i'm the first in the lies i'm he that liveth and what and i was dead you know some it somehow amen the devil thought that in killing jesus he was going to win he thought he was re he really got him but he did not you know he he said you know what that deceiver said that in three days you're gonna get up they said now we're gonna put a a big stone let's he probably got so many soldiers and they got a great stone and they rolled and made sure he didn't get up are you with me and then they put guards down where the uh the disciples couldn't come and steal him away then they're right but jesus amen he was uh not subject amen uh to any man or to any group of soldiers or whatever but he had to fulfill what was written of him are you with me and he knew what the scripture said about him amen he knew that amen the third day he was getting up no matter how how oh hallelujah i don't care how much the stone wall i don't care how many soldiers was there jesus was getting up amen praise god hallelujah the devil did not know in lifting up jesus actually amen jesus was making a show of him openly [Music] amen because he said if i be lifted up he didn't know amen that he was falling into a trap amen the bible said had he known he would not have crucified him if he knew that he was going to be stripped of all his power amen and all of his authority he wouldn't never kill jesus oh you wouldn't be because when he killed jesus he kept the wrong one amen because jesus hadn't done no wrong amen adam was innocent he was innocent in the beginning they were without sin but when they sinned they met then they fell from god and god was requiring amen the weight is the sin was death never the penalty so there was no one that could redeem man back because all have sinned and come shallow the glory of god there was no way we could get back to god but god himself saw the need of redemption somebody to bring us back to god and now jeremiah said it was such the heavens searched up beneath the earth and there was nobody so when they got through such and there was nobody that could do it so god himself [Music] amen god himself had to come down in the form of flesh so god created a body that he could get in and he was called the son of god or you would be so he was the beginning of the creation of god so by the grace of god god coming down to do something oh lord i'm so glad that god came down to show himself that i can do all things all things are possible to them to believe god wanted to redeem us bring us back to god brothers and sisters this god had a plan amen and god knew what he was doing amen the disciples could not fully understand what god had done amen he had to come after his resurrection and walk through the door and tell them amen it was something about the way it broke bread and their eyes would open and they knew him there was something about amen thomas wasn't there they couldn't hardly believe that the devil was defeated look thomas you know i don't believe amen because i saw him die amen i know they nailed him amen oh he was crucified i heard him on the road to him as fools and yeah what's wrong with y'all oh hallelujah what mean you to weep and break our hearts amen he began to unfold in them to what the word had spoken and prophesied concerning him the songs and the prophets and he began to open the understanding that they might understand the scriptures amen i believe god got to open our eyes in this hour in this time and let us know that the devil is defeated may the holy ghost come down may the power of god come down and open our eyes of our understanding that we recognize we are not defeated we are victors we're more than conquerors brother and sister
