read 13 together stay yourselves and wander cry ye out and cry and they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink 10. the vision of all is become unto you as words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he said i cannot for it is sealed 12. together wherefore the lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips to honor me but remove their hearts far from me and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men may god bless the readers where did you be seated the book of modical 4 last book in the old testament modica 4. and 5. i was talking this you know i was just praying and there was several things came to my mind it's time to return it's time to come back to god turning point is just too much turning point and um but we were talking about turning the hearts and hopefully we'll it'll be a little bit of everything it says behold uh four and five behold i will send you elijah the prophet be behold i will send you elijah the prophets before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord the way russia is mounting up over there and the way things are looking look like we're nearing the end because if we we know it was three walls the first wall second woe in the book of revelation third war first world war second world war the third war it just talked about three world wars and we are near that great and dreadful day then they talk about the battle of armageddon which is the last battle and we realized that we're nearing a time where everything is getting red tents the world is getting tense and um if the wall break out we don't know what kind of world we're gonna have in the next few days if russia goes into lithuania and this is not politics we're not bringing that but i just want you to be aware amen if you're not right regard it's time to do something about your condition because we don't know how much time we got here it says the great and dreadful day it's a time coming we call the great tribulation period and that's a time nobody if you understand what's going to happen you don't want to be around here if you think it's chaotic now it's gonna really be chaotic if you're around left behind but we know the church goes up and god turns away from the gentiles and god start stealing with the jews and they come back and they start serving the lord 144 000 jews over in israel so when the jews recognized jesus christ as savior which they rejected him but they were blind for our satan god blind them for our sake but once they start seeing again then god gives them two prophets like unto moses and elijah and the jews start receiving the lord you all know the spirit of god lifts up off of the gentiles the other nations so by the grace of god the bible said only he did not let will let until he be taken out of the way the only thing holding the devil back from just total the trying to destroy and just kill and just right here have it is that god still has his holy spirit in the land but when the spirit of god lifts up out of here you know the bible tells us in revelation 12 that satan come down because he knows his health but a short time he's no more the bible said the accuser of the brother is cast down the devil accuses you before god but it's going to come a time when he's cast down into the earth with a short time before he's thrown in the bottomless pit bound there for a thousand years are you with me so we're out of time period amen where things could happen overnight things could just you can wake up in the morning they use the expression and all hell is let loose it's just another world just like we woke up one morning then the whole world was shut down almost because of the coronavirus we can wake up in the morning and it's just totally chaos walls america england all the countries going into battle brother and sister what with all this nuclear power and all of this just what would happen if something like that happens brother listen the great and dreadful day and then he says and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and hodge the children to the fathers at least i come and smite the earth with the curse and god gives a period of time that the hearts of the children might be turned to the fathers as he gave a period of time before the jews went into their dark period of history before titus army came and destroyed jerusalem god gave a little period of john the baptist coming on the scene to turn the children hearts and turn the father's hearts to the children are you with me so god gives us a period of time to turn the children heart back to the apostolic fathers are you with me so here and uh turn into hearts luke 1 and 17. maybe i want you to see what we're saying the hearts turning our hearts talking to you you're not he says concerning john the baptist he says in the 16th verse and many of the children of elders shall be turned to the lord their god luke 1 16 and many of the children of israel shall be turned to the lord their god see the children were illegal supposedly men already serving the lord they were god's chosen people isn't that right but somehow their hearts still needed to be turned and folks go to church and say we're all christians why should our hearts be turned out we all go to church we all believe in jesus and the jews felt like we all serve the god of abraham and ours and jacob we all in other words how you gonna turn us to what we got it and you know that's the way the church world feels like it's today we already got we christians we already say we got it so they felt like they were safe and secure not knowing what had happened to them they were more into tradition than they were into god are you with me he said in vain you do worship me teaching for doctrine the commandment of man see they went more into vain worship that wasn't into true worship anymore brother and sister and that's what happens you know he said in the 17th verse and he should go before him in the spirit and power of their lives to turn the hearts of the fathers to the what children notice that monaco said and the hearts of the children to the fathers notice he only dealt with one part of this verse the elijah of that time which is john the baptist she turned the hearts of the fathers to children amen jesus said except you come as a little child you ain't nobody asking it in amen but because they thought they didn't need him they didn't want him and see some folks think they don't need god so they don't want god amen you can never force god on somebody to think they already got it but when i talk about turning the hearts see saul of tasha which was paul he had to be churned he meant because he thought that he was saved and that he was worshiping god in the truth amen but on his way to the masters to persecute the church of god a light shine from heaven he said who you lord you know the one that he's supposed to be in worship he supposed to know who he was he said who are you lord the lord said i'm jesus whom you persecuted we knew this persecuting god's people god said you persecuted me are you with me and he recognized from that time from that time amen his heart was turned turning the hearts you know you must come to a turning point in your life it's a place you got to meet god just like he met god that day and if you met god somewhere along that line then you know that turning point amen that time when you met god and it caused you to turn amen so here he says the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the jest amen we all in some time past with disobedient children in that right and we were disobedient but now we're obedient once we heard the word come under conviction and and accepted jesus christ as our lord and savior amen until you do that you're disobedient your heart needs to be turned are you with me if your heart is not turned you're going to keep on doing what you're doing and living like you're living because you don't want jesus amen as the jews did not want him because they didn't need him they were they had what they thought they needed so they didn't need jesus sometimes in our lives amen we don't have room for jesus because we're filling up with other things he said the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord see jesus went to prepare a place for us but there must become the spirit of elijah to come to prepare you for the lord are you with me god amen prepares you and i that we might be able to receive the lord god amen god is doing things but our hearts need to be turned the book of first king 18. first kings 18. amen it's something about this this world that we live in the people say they don't want god amen they just rejected the lord all together as a whole the nation have rejected god the world itself don't want god no more they don't think they need him they got everything else to fulfill that void in their life and the devil will feel the void and the thirst for god with all kind of stuff but it won't work it will never satisfy you you'll never have the peace of god and i'm let's just look at first kings 18 36 and it says and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said the lord god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel israel jezebel had bought into israel baal worship ahab went and married amen jezebel which was an idolater and i believe that the people have bought the world in the church amen i was down praying this morning and as i was praying he said now god sent moses to call the people out of egypt and show enough god uh destroyed the egyptians in the red sea god saves us from our sin but the next move is god to save you from yourself are you with me because god dealt with them after the egyptian was destroyed he had to deliver them from themselves see when god brought them out of egypt god had to get egypt out of them are you see because god has to deal with things amen god save you from your sin amen that you were born in up into that but god has to get that out of you that old nature amen praise god god has a deal with you to sanctify you clean you up amen they hadn't made it to the promised land but they were on their way to the promised land and oftentimes people amen just because you come out and accept jesus christ amen god is not true with you yet amen you're not completed as of yet and on this life journey as christians amen we're constantly dying daily there's a constantly god is still working on us daily each and every individual god is working on you god is working on me god is working on us are you with me so we must allow and understand amen that we have not uh we not crossed the finishing line yet amen we still have a course to run amen paul understood he said i finished my course he said i fought a good fight i've kept the faith i finished my course amen you and i must finish our course but while we are doing we must press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of god that's in christ amen they're still pressing on there's still things in our lives that we must attain amen that we're apprehended of that we must they may keep on pressing the wars amen praise god because there is perfection for the bride amen there is a capstone headstone for the bride praise god that's christ and his fortness he himself the person of jesus christ amen not just amen not just godliness not just brotherly kindness but we're talking about charity perfect love amen coming into the statue of a perfect man are you with me thou art god in israel and that i i am thy servant that i have done all these things at that word see elijah had a commission he called a monk calm a showdown and he got telling to bring all the false prophets of baal and see what in the world that the children of god they look like they're kind of mixed up and that's what happens to the church the church is mixed up they got amen tradition of man and doctrines of men and they push it and mix it up with the word of god and god amen has looked at it and then he calls in revelation 18 come out of her my people for babylon the great is fallen are you a man god calls for a spiritual exodus out of mystery of babylon because people amen are more interested in what the church say than what the words say but elijah calling the people back to the word it's time to return amen turn amen the heart turn in the hearts amen and i'm saying turn with all your heart brother turn with everything you got sister amen then you know this is the mont common showdown where amen the prophets of baal they have already had their turn and they got an answer by fire elijah said let him be god and they cut themselves jumped up and shouted and danced in the spirit and the fire god never came amen praise god and you see people are cutting themselves jumping up and down shouting and all but god ain't in it praise god we see we want god vindication in our worship brother and sister you must amen as an individual to god then answers by fire let him be and god wants to burn your sacrifice he wants to send set your sacrifice on fire praise god hallelujah god wants to vindicate you as a christian god wants to give you amen praise god the identification that the blood has been applied god wants to fill you with his spirit and fire are you look man see the fire got to come [Music] john says one coming after me whose shoes are not worth it it's stupid nothing loose he should baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire the fire got to come brother fire got to come in your life something amen he said i wouldn't you're hot or cold i want you to be on fire praise god hallelujah where's your fire brother where's your fire sister amen it's got to come some fire inside praise god i believe the woman at the well caught a fire praise god i believe it's time for us to catch a fire hallelujah the fire of the holy ghost something stirs something to burn amen burn holy spirit burn in me hallelujah and this is what he said he said hear me the 37th verse hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art what thou art the lord god amen and that thou has what thou has turned their what see god is interested in turning not just your head but god is turning you what heart heart back to what back to the word amen they got away from the word and god wanted to turn their hearts back you know a lot of people come to church but they're hearty in it you know i was just praying in the drop down in my spirit you know people go to work every day hating they go they hate their job amen and people come home from working or whatever and they hate to come home because they're not in love with their wife they're not in love with their husbands and they hate to come home sometimes people fall out of love the one that used to you know they used to love so dear they just fall out of love and when they fall out of love it's a burden even to see one another they can't talk without fussing why because they're not in love no more see when you love them you got some patience with them praise god even when they're wrong you got some patience because you're so in love amen see folks fall out of love with god they fall out of love see when you love god it's something in you you want to worship god you don't mind amen cooking for the husband when you love him you don't mind bringing the paycheck in amen let's let's see what you know take care of these bills because it's a lot of fire this is we're working this thing together are you looking man not this is mine ditching yours and nothing don't don't sit in my chair and are you with me amen who ate my fools you know by the grace of god you're together you're one it should be peace in the house amen so the place you want to come and rest is at home are you with me you ought to come home and and and you ought to feel like amen there's some peace at home we are a imminent count in god's house not just physical building but in god's house and we ought to know that the comforter is there not just this physical building but i'm talking about even the comforter is come down inside of you for he said in my father's house in my father's kingdom amen so you that are in the kingdom of god amen not just in this physical building but you that are in the kingdom of god amen you know that there's peace there's joy and there's righteousness that's in your kingdom and if you're in the kingdom amen praise god god has made provision for you god has made provision for you in his kingdom so aren't you glad that god has made provision for you and his kingdom okay your hearts are turned back brother and sister and that's what god has done for you and i he's turned our hearts by okay he said he said then the fire of the lord fell amen i'm going to tell you something god would let the fire of the lord fall amen praise god when the sacrifice is acceptable amen when your worship and your status with god is acceptable god will let the fire fall are you with me but amen if anything that amen that's in the way amen praise god we got to know that lord i want my sacrifice and my worship to be acceptable praise god what you give to god you want god to accept what you give it but you cannot give it if you don't want to give it amen when we're giving it and you know holding back on god amen not our hearts in what we're doing your heart got to be in it let me um say this uh uh oftentimes the people come to stages in their walk their christian journey amen due to romans 6 let me just do that due to romans 6. praise god we come to stages in our christian walk i i i thought it would be a little different this morning i don't want to get too excited that we're not coming home i want to make the points that we can come home and understand amen that god is desiring more than what you're giving him amen you know sometimes folks want to be delivered amen it's just like the prophet god when the message the hour of the lord's deliverance amen they just sit and beat the arrow enough so there was only partial deliverance you know brother and sister you don't want partial deliverance in your life i'm talking now are you with me you don't want pasture deliverance you want total deliverance are you with me you don't want god just to move just a little bit look uh due to romans 6 and 1 and he says now these are the commandments the statues and the judgments which the lord your god command to teach you that you might do them in the land whether ye go to what that thou mighty s fear the lord what to keep what not some but what he said man should not live by bread alone by by what every word you know it comes down to places in people's lives and they wonder why it's something that we're holding back it's things that we we we're not ready to give up it's things that we're not don't you think you can handle it and you're trying to handle your situation you trying to deal with it and you're trying to you know hey i'm i'ma make it ah it's time for you to surrender to god don't try to fix it yourself because you could not save yourself it took the blood of jesus oh you look man and if he that begun a good work in you he's able to complete it he's able to finish it so don't you try to work on your own situation in your own or things that you know that that you're dealing with you're trying to deal with it kind of privately and secretly and god says let god deal with it praise god all things are naked and open before the eyes of him whom we have to do are you up there some things we're trying to fix and we're trying to deal with instead of trying instead of giving it to god are you with me somebody got to understand what i because i you know somewhere you know you you here praying and god telling your stuff praise god so i know i'm talking to somebody praise god so he says he you know he don't want you to keep part of the word he wants you to keep all his statures and all his commandments which i commanded thee thou and our son and our son sons and all the days of thy life and that thou days may be prolonged you know a lot of people days are not prolonged days are short to honor that father and their mother and their days will be long isn't that right but we can cut you got godly parents and you don't honor them you don't do what they tell you watch days of cuts show who you got to blame yourself because you did not honor mom and dad are you wondering it says here therefore o israel and deserve to do it that it may be well what well with thee and that you may increase what are y'all with me that you may increase what see your blessings are being held back because of you it's not because god hadn't given it to you and god don't want you to have it it's because of you holding back on god and i will increase you mightily as the lord god of thy fathers has promised you god promised to bless you amen and blessing i will bless you and multiply it i'll multiply you you never saw the righteous of a second seed begging god to do things for you but how can he do it when you won't let him you must allow god to do what he said he'll do his promises are true god will do it if you just allow god to be god he said in the land that floyd's with milk and honey are you with me here oh israel the lord our god is what is one lord it ain't be one god are you with me all these other gods and all these things trying to take the place of god the bible says seek you first the kingdom of heaven and his righteousness and all other things would be what if anything you put before god is your god amen but if you seek god put god first amen then the blessings are yours the thing is we don't put god in his proper place the oh it's one lord he says and i shall what come on read read it again don't you what the prophet said what's wrong with people the reason why they do the stuff that they do because they don't love god the bible said when they knew god they glorified them not it's god it became vain in the imagination their foolish hearts were darkened because they didn't learn the love of the truth praise god i'm gonna tell you you got to love this truth you got to love the word you got to love god if you don't love god amen praise god then you want god to love you are you with me but he said jacob have i love and he saw have i hated amen your attitude towards the word your attitude how you respond and how you conduct your lives how you treat the word amen and then you want all the blessings amen it's not the church it's not the preacher it's the word of god i'm talking about turning the hearts praise god turning the hearts not just people say well i believe the message you know i'm turning back uh all that people draw nigh to me with their mouth that's what he said in isaiah but their hearts are what far for me this is not just lip service it's not just lip service brother fred said stop talking and get to walking okay so amen just don't talk and let's live it amen you know it's good to talk about it but you got to live this thing amen know i i thought about i'm in the race i'm in the i'm in it this race to win it and i got to lose in order to gain are you with me you must be in this race to finish it and to win it amen you don't want to oh lose out on eternal life you want to win i might win christ okay i i let me he said the lord and thou shall love the lord thy god with what the major trouble you have in the church is a lack of love when you love god with all your heart you can it'll sustain you it's sustained you when trouble arrives it'll sustain you know oftentimes i just young young pastor early 20s and about close to 50 years ago oh i had some difficult counseling moments with couples that were sometimes fighting sometimes and they were twice my age sometimes and i'm counseling and trying to get marriages together and things like that it always was one of my first questions do you love her and they say yeah do you love him yeah okay we can work a little bit we can we can get through some stuff if we love one another but if you don't love one another it's difficult to patch stuff up you can't you can't hardly bring folks together when they don't love them if they say do you love him oh no love him i i don't think so see if you love him you can forgive him are you with me but if you don't love them you you ain't gonna hardly forgive them are you with me it's a lot of things amen but the the root of it is how much we love god because when you love god with all see other things is small things other things in life are small you can handle anything that comes your way when you love god with all your heart the problem uh that i've had through the course of about 50 years of preaching is amen the people come to places in their lives where they fell out of love it's hard to get a marriage together when people have fell out of love i'ma tell you brother fred that's a difficult thing when people come home and they're not in love it's just fussing and organ and all kind of stuff all they do is look at one another false one another problem and i mean you can't hardly live together like that the minute something turned one way oh goodness there's no chaotic but when you're loved you're going to be patient love is patient love is what kind and see you you the thing is with god amen we go down some rough roads sometimes god's gonna allow he said many are the what afflictions of the righteous are you with me as i said in mullins amen god said as many as i love i what i chase amen you know if you're going to be a son or daughter of god you got to endure chastisement you're gonna be you know because if you're not you know going through the chastisement time amen then god deals with you not his sons but as a what huh yeah y'all got it amen but you got to endure some things god will take you down roads amen and pathways amen that amen is show you what what's in you praise god amen and sometimes even in a marriage god shows up hey yeah i'm just showing you amen if you really love this sister you love this brother you're going to go through some stuff but y'all got to know if you really really truly love one another you won't even have to be patient and kind with one another and in this christian walk if you really love god with see that's what happens we only love a litter but that woman amen that was washing jesus feeding and kissing them and which is with her hair and all that she loved him much she had a lot of problems did she had a lot of sins but she loved them much but simon in the corner watching that woman criticized her boy on the christian walk you got a lot of simons that invited jesus and didn't welcome him amen so by the grace of god god amen we invite jesus into our lives and in our homes amen and we don't welcome him praise god simon you didn't greet me at the door with some water and you know this woman with the basin and amen that i can wash my dirty feet but this woman's oh brother sister she uh she kissed its dirty filthy feet that'll walk through uh the dung and all of that that's in the streets but she loved him much and she had a lot of sin but she loved him brother and sister i'm talking about when you love you go through some stuff you do some things amen when you love god you go through some stuff praise god but when you partially love them the minute something goes you blow up i ain't serving god no more why somebody said something to me in the church church ain't got nothing to do with your relationship with god are you with me that person wasn't there when god saved you amen that person didn't die for you it was the blood of jesus amen praise god when you got
