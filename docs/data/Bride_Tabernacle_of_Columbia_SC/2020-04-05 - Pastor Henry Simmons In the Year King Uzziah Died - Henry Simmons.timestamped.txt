[31:24] again we thank everyone for tuning in
[31:29] this morning the Book of Isaiah the
[31:33] sixth chapter we appreciate for the
[31:39] gardening musician sister Shana Minister
[31:46] Palmer this morning appreciate all the
[31:50] ones that happen with those services and
[32:02] il-6 chapter in the year King Uzziah
[32:11] died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[32:17] throne high and lifted up and his train
[32:22] filled the temple but above it stood the
[32:27] seraphim's each one had six wings and
[32:32] between he covered his face and with
[32:36] twain he covered his feet and between he
[32:41] did fly and one cried until another and
[32:46] said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts
[32:53] the whole earth is full of his glory and
[32:57] the posts of the door moved at the voice
[33:02] of him that cried and the house was
[33:06] filled with smoke then said i whoa is me
[33:12] if I'm undone because I am a man of
[33:17] unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
[33:23] a people of unclean lips for my eyes
[33:28] have seen the king the Lord of hosts
[33:34] then flew one of the surf
[33:36] and to me having live coal in his hand
[33:42] which he had taken with the tongue from
[33:47] the altar altar and he laid it upon my
[33:52] mouth and he said lo this has touched
[33:57] the lips and nine ickett is is taken
[34:01] away and our sin purged also I heard a
[34:08] voice of the Lord saying whom shall I
[34:14] send and who will go for us then said I
[34:20] here am I send me
[34:25] may God bless to read which words you
[34:28] may be seated
[34:30] thank the Lord amen god is good amen
[34:34] we taught we were just praying and
[34:39] reading in the Book of Isaiah and we
[34:45] came across this particular chapter and
[34:49] as I was in prayer the top it is in the
[34:56] year King Uzziah died and the Year King
[35:02] Uzziah died we realize that God's
[35:10] servant said the Prophet was a young
[35:12] prophet but he had won that he was
[35:18] focusing and had the utmost respect for
[35:23] the King Uzziah and that King had his
[35:30] attention sometimes we have Kings in our
[35:37] lives that have somewhat blinded us
[35:40] fought for our purpose and what God has
[35:45] chosen for your life and for you to do
[35:51] an individual so that king in our Zell's
[35:57] life or King Uzziah very one time a very
[36:04] godly King a very king that God was used
[36:09] sin we know at the end of the journey
[36:13] what happened he got leprosy and so
[36:15] forth but yet he was a good king
[36:21] sometimes they men we don't know that
[36:25] will being destructive
[36:28] we don't know sometimes what's going on
[36:32] because we're in the moment sometimes
[36:36] our eyes and our focus is not where and
[36:40] need to be and I believe that sometimes
[36:46] Uzziah have to die needs to be Amit Amit
[36:52] moved out of our view it happened when
[36:59] use iodide Isaiah said that he
[37:06] recognized his condition because he saw
[37:10] the law and he recognized how his life
[37:18] and it's a life condition said I'm a man
[37:21] of unclean lips and he knew that he
[37:25] dwelled in the midst of a people of
[37:28] unclean lips and he realized that he
[37:34] needed he saw a holy God and he had a
[37:40] glimpse of what God was it was no more
[37:44] Uzziah but he said I saw the Lord in the
[37:51] midst of the virus that has hid in the
[37:53] world maybe our tension our focus of me
[37:57] might have been on our economical
[38:01] situation
[38:02] how much money we can accumulate and how
[38:05] much wealth we can accumulate our
[38:10] attention and our focus and might have
[38:12] been on our body
[38:13] hi you know how strong we can get in how
[38:17] bill how we can make it beautiful and
[38:22] healthy maybe we've put a met other
[38:26] things in the Miss Sun in our view and a
[38:31] become more important than to us then
[38:36] the Lord so many things I can name but I
[38:42] might miss your situation maybe it's
[38:47] your husband
[38:49] maybe it's your wife maybe it's your
[38:54] children even it could have been a
[38:59] mental ability they meant to play
[39:02] basketball a football maybe a Sheree you
[39:06] had so much higher hopes South Carolina
[39:11] was looking for a national championship
[39:16] in women basketball and then sometimes
[39:21] God even our focus is on those things
[39:25] and sometimes God would change things
[39:28] and I believe we all apause for a moment
[39:32] and we ought to focus our attention in
[39:36] the polls and we ought to ask God amen
[39:42] it's going on oh did you stop everything
[39:49] for a moment amen that we could get
[39:53] refocus millions of dollars we might be
[40:03] able to attain but God stops everything
[40:09] he allows this to happen expected to
[40:17] happen such a thing we call the whole
[40:31] world to come to a halt don't know
[40:43] what's next
[40:51] wow this is going on
[40:55] god help me to get refocus I believe I
[41:02] they took the time he meant because he
[41:08] was a young prophet
[41:10] maybe his attention was on God speaking
[41:14] to him and dealing with him in the
[41:18] spiritual aspect of his life maybe he
[41:23] was focused more on the political side
[41:27] and his attention was focus on the
[41:32] people conditioner got bad the church
[41:38] was in a terrible condition God's people
[41:47] with the for God I believe that I shall
[41:58] didn't know that God was going to use
[42:01] him I was reading a little of Isaiah 1
[42:06] and it says the eyes are warning warn
[42:10] the vision of Isaiah the son
[42:14] Emil's which he saw concerning Judah and
[42:19] Jerusalem amen
[42:23] in the days of Uzziah joltin ezel and
[42:29] Hezekiah king of Judah see Isaiah was
[42:34] the son of a prophet and I say himself
[42:39] was a prophet witches are not the usual
[42:43] he meant that that it happens that way
[42:50] he said here Oh heaven and give for the
[42:57] Lord has spoken
[42:59] I have nourished and both children and
[43:05] they have rebelled against me are you
[43:10] with me
[43:12] the Ox knows his owner and as his master
[43:19] krill but you do not know my people do
[43:27] not consider are you with me he said ah
[43:33] a sinful nation a people Lane with the
[43:38] nicotine a seed of evildoers children
[43:43] [Music]
[43:46] they have forsaken the Lord they have
[43:51] provoked the Holy One children to anger
[43:56] they are going away you will revoke more
[44:09] and more the whole head is sick
[44:15] and the whole heart is faint from the
[44:21] sole of the foot even until the head
[44:26] there is no soundness in it but wounds
[44:32] and bruises and putrefying sores they
[44:39] have not been closed neither bound up
[44:46] neither modified with augment your
[44:54] country is desolate you sit is a bird
[44:58] with fire you'll and strangers the value
[45:02] in your presence and it is desolate and
[45:08] although throwing then overthrown by
[45:13] strangers and the daughters of Zion is
[45:18] left as a cottage in the vineyard and as
[45:23] a large in the garden of cuckoo and as a
[45:29] besieged city except the Lord of hosts
[45:33] had left us a very small rivet we should
[45:38] have been as sodom and we should have
[45:44] been locked unto Gomorrha hear the word
[45:48] of the Lord ye rulers of Sodom into the
[45:55] law of God you people are tomorrow to
[46:02] what purpose is this multitude of your
[46:06] sacrifices than their me saith the Lord
[46:10] I am full of burnt offering and RAM and
[46:14] the fat fat beasts and I delight not in
[46:23] the blood of the bullets in the wrath
[46:25] Lambs
[46:26] oh the ego
[46:29] when he cometh to appear before me who
[46:33] has required this at your hand to thread
[46:37] my course bring no more vain ablations
[46:42] in sent his abomination unto me and a
[46:47] new moon in the Sabbath the calling of
[46:51] the similar I cannot away with it is
[46:56] iniquity even the Sodom meetings God
[47:02] that angry God was no longer pleased
[47:10] with Israel no doubt the Prophet was too
[47:17] busy looking at us I to understand the
[47:20] spiritual condition of the people
[47:24] nevertheless we assume that God is
[47:28] accepting what we're giving him we
[47:32] assume that God is well pleased they met
[47:37] with our sacrifices in our efforts too
[47:42] many times folks have come to church and
[47:44] they met because they got in the bills
[47:47] and they thought that God would squeeze
[47:49] with them so many times folks have sang
[47:54] on the choir and they played the music
[47:57] and they're preached in the pulpits and
[47:59] they thought that God was pleased but I
[48:05] believe that he said when you say of
[48:09] dying and so the Lord my mind is going
[48:19] different places and I thought that
[48:24] demanda people have a focus their
[48:29] attention on the building as the Jews in
[48:33] the Senate Ghani told Jesus and how
[48:37] beautiful the temple was G
[48:49] [Music]
[49:20] [Music]
[49:55] God said no more do our war dead Amen
[49:59] God has a stop it for a moment maybe
[50:03] I'll teach it and our focus is on the
[50:05] building and not on the root root temple
[50:09] of God some people believe that Amanda
[50:16] Jesus met a woman at the well and he
[50:22] acts so for drinking she cannot
[50:25] understand the spiritual application for
[50:34] the woman the Jews and the Samaritans
[50:39] had no dealing and she said you know
[50:46] fathers worshiped in this mountain say
[50:50] we had a son play
[50:53] is that we watch it in its mouth our
[50:57] touch man and we were a man attached to
[51:00] a sudden mountain a sudden holy place so
[51:08] you use aiya
[51:11] yo City God you're building that you
[51:18] were used to they may go on
[51:20] traditionally to you King
[51:35] no God I did not know his spiritual
[51:40] condition many come because religious
[51:48] what was required of them but it only
[51:53] was a custom in a tradition their heart
[51:58] was no longer in it see the woman said
[52:04] now we worship in this mountain but you
[52:08] say that we ought to be watching him in
[52:11] Jerusalem see but the woman did not know
[52:15] the hour that poses for normal knowing
[52:32] that there was the feast of Passover the
[52:35] face of unleavened bread and that was
[52:38] the face of pinnacles praise God and the
[52:44] face of the traffic because he drew back
[52:47] to homeland but there's also a feast of
[52:53] atonement and the feast of tabernacle
[52:57] are you see what happened it's a season
[53:03] it's a time
[53:43] hee hee
[55:56] [Music]
[56:06] [Music]

[57:12] that our coming and now is the neither
[57:16] in this mountain
[57:18] amen I'm Italian neither in this
[57:23] building they meant nor any other bills
[57:28] neither in this mountain neither at
[57:32] Jerusalem but our coming to now is that
[57:37] the true worshipers of God I said the
[57:41] true worshipers see if some folk need a
[57:45] mint the bills into Washington some
[57:49] folks need a crowd to worship and he
[57:52] meant some folks he meant have to make a
[57:55] appear during the niche to go to Rome or
[57:59] the maker amen go to image these holy
[58:03] sites and once they reach there they can
[58:07] see the splendor of Roman and see the
[58:12] great amen papa and see the great gold
[58:18] and precious artwork over in Rome but

[59:29] my salvation oh brother sauce is not
[59:34] what you can do that's what Christ is
[59:37] already done I said there is no holy
[59:41] place so amen to minimize he met God had
[59:48] to remove our alsa and let us get
[59:51] refocus and let us focus on Jesus
[59:58] there's only one place one holy place
[1:00:04] where God will meet what man God has
[1:00:09] chosen please amen that we can watch him
[1:00:13] him and that place it's Christ for he so
[1:00:20] gained a watch of me was washing me in
[1:00:23] spirit and truth you gotta come to
[1:00:28] Christ that is the Lord holy place
[1:00:33] that is the place where you can save me
[1:00:39] that is the place where you can have
[1:00:43] peace that is the place where you can
[1:00:46] have joy that is the place well you can
[1:00:50] have righteousness in the Holy Ghost in
[1:00:54] Christ for by one spirit are we all
[1:00:58] baptized into one body that is the
[1:01:03] please I'm saying to you what I feel
[1:01:09] like
[1:01:10] that many
[1:01:13] have not reached the place where they
[1:01:18] really understand the voice of God and
[1:01:22] God speaking to them and that's what has
[1:01:27] happened so oftentimes I believe Saul of
[1:01:33] Tarsus his Uzziah was his religion the
[1:01:38] Pharisees I believe that he was so
[1:01:43] focused on being at the top but the fire
[1:01:49] seed religion his training and any
[1:01:53] schooling had blinded him from the real
[1:01:57] true light Saul of Tarsus I if I had
[1:02:03] time I go to acts 9 but I'm not gonna go
[1:02:07] there you're familiar with the story
[1:02:11] Saul of Tarsus had letters they were
[1:02:18] that gave him authority letters that
[1:02:23] gave him Authority Amen he realized that
[1:02:28] those letters in his authority wasn't no
[1:02:30] good when it came to him persecute the
[1:02:35] Church of the Living God
[1:02:37] but if I find any of that way if they're
[1:02:48] worshiping Jesus see what I want you to
[1:02:55] understand that
[1:02:58] so Tony had it but he didn't have it I'm
[1:03:04] gonna tell you many people are so
[1:03:07] entrenched in the church - the church
[1:03:15] had blinded them folks are so dependent
[1:03:23] upon their religion
[1:03:26] for religion has blinded them folks
[1:03:31] don't even know for Paul sales of our
[1:03:37] gospel be hid it is here to them that
[1:03:42] allows and whom the god of this world
[1:03:46] has blinded the mind of the glory is the
[1:03:57] image of God they were blinded by the is
[1:04:26] blinded by the blind of the church
[1:05:03] knocking on the door the only church
[1:05:06] that put cry so now outside what you
[1:05:23] doing
[1:05:24] some folks are saying a holy man a man a
[1:05:30] bishop some folks have we have even a
[1:05:33] doctor
[1:05:37] [Music]
[1:05:50] Jesus was gone again
[1:06:55] [Music]
[1:06:58] they are taken they met the prayer to
[1:07:02] Folkestone young people don't know what
[1:07:04] it means to pray to pray to - they get a
[1:07:08] breakthrough someone you need to talk to
[1:07:12] in your house they meant why y'all find
[1:07:16] a lot to somewhere new Darden amen and
[1:07:20] talk to God and don't get up until he
[1:07:24] talks back amen and then you know even
[1:07:28] to God still speaks oh yes somehow Sid
[1:07:37] but that God spoke to him thank God baby
[1:07:43] said who will go for us
[1:08:08] I'll put you straight you gonna put you
[1:08:12] on the streetcar suite I need to go tell
[1:08:15] you what you must do
[1:08:17] Paul I want you to go down to the street
[1:08:20] called straight and you find one there
[1:08:23] by the name Ayane nice and he'll pray
[1:08:26] for you I know you're blind by the light
[1:08:29] now but here pray for you that you can
[1:08:32] receive your sight you need to repent be
[1:08:40] baptized in water in the name of Jesus
[1:08:42] Christ for the remission of your sin the
[1:08:45] promises you shall receive the baptism
[1:08:48] of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:54] the body of Christ you need the baptism
[1:08:57] of the Holy Ghost don't stop with
[1:09:00] justification don't stop with somebody
[1:09:02] telling you you got it you got to have
[1:09:05] it for yourself what is lacking in the
[1:09:08] church today
[1:09:09] what is it locking people that are
[1:09:13] identified with Christ in the end time
[1:09:17] what is lacking is a real personal
[1:09:20] experience with Christ
[1:09:22] I believe that Moses had his burning
[1:09:26] bush experience he saw the Lord I said
[1:09:37] God still speaks and of God haven't
[1:09:40] spoken to you and let you know your
[1:09:44] purpose
[1:09:54] we'll talk with Jesus when is the last
[1:11:00] time you talked to him and he talked
[1:11:03] back to you have you never had a
[1:11:06] personal contact with God some people
[1:11:12] don't even know his voice and it's sad
[1:11:20] so much religion so much singing is so
[1:11:25] much sacrifice it's so I was in prayer
[1:11:38] my heart was just constantly Lord it's
[1:11:44] God speaks back to me by folks ask
[1:11:50] action you know they're bored of God by

[1:12:08] and fro and God has to stop our to and
