[42:48] Henry Simmons to give me this
[42:51] opportunity to come and uh speak before
[42:53] you. Amen. We appreciate the Lord for
[42:57] how we're being kept. We're being kept
[43:00] so
[43:01] nicely. Uh and we are enjoying our stay.
[43:05] We're also discussing with my wife.
[43:08] You're such a good people with such a
[43:10] good spirit people as who love the Lord.
[43:14] We are really enjoying the fellowship.
[43:16] Amen. Praise God. Uh like the pastor
[43:19] said, my name is uh brother Jimmy
[43:23] Kasha. Uh you may be seated for a
[43:26] while from uh
[43:28] Zambia. Uh most of you have heard about
[43:31] Zimbabwe but Zambia is the neighbor to
[43:34] Zimbabwe. So I come from Zambia and uh
[43:39] in the capital city Lusaka and uh church
[43:44] name is Bethlehem Tabernacle.
[43:48] Amen. Um just a little background about
[43:51] me. We came to the message when I was
[43:53] nine. Uh that was
[43:57] 1986 and uh my wife their family I think
[44:01] came two years later. So, we were Sunday
[44:04] schools
[44:06] together. Uh, and we grew up in the
[44:09] message. I could see her at Sunday
[44:11] school. I didn't know she would be my
[44:14] wife. Yeah. But I I knew this sister was
[44:18] just so committed. And um later by God's
[44:23] grace, we got married. We have uh three
[44:26] children, two girls and one boy. Amen.
[44:30] So, we appreciate the Lord. She's always
[44:32] stood by me like I was testifying the
[44:36] other places it was uh difficult to get
[44:39] a visa for her to join me. I've been to
[44:42] US three times now. First time was uh
[44:46] the last last year and the other year
[44:49] about the same period of April. So this
[44:51] third time I said I would love to go
[44:53] with my wife but it was difficult to get
[44:56] a visa because the time we applied for
[44:58] the visa
[45:00] um they were pushing interviews to
[45:04] 2026. So I prayed I said Lord if you've
[45:07] allowed me to go with my wife uh let the
[45:10] dates move. Amen. So we were planning to
[45:15] start out
[45:17] um early April or late March. So they
[45:20] moved the dates to April
[45:23] 2nd. I changed her appointment to that.
[45:27] But I said, "Lord, I needed to move a
[45:29] little further into February because we
[45:32] need enough time to buy the tickets cuz
[45:35] when it gets too close, they become
[45:37] expensive." So we I prayed over it. By
[45:40] the end of January, the Lord made a way.
[45:43] They opened them in February like the
[45:46] just a few days after end of uh January.
[45:49] So I appreciate the Lord. And when we
[45:52] went there, the interview just took
[45:53] about 2 minutes. Um I I I had a plan
[45:57] because I knew they would uh maybe give
[46:01] a hard time and you know your accent
[46:05] sometimes uh for us in Zambia it's
[46:07] difficult to hear. You got you got to do
[46:10] a lot of padon padon. So I didn't want
[46:13] her to have a hard time. So I told them
[46:15] um I need to interpret for her. So I I I
[46:19] was part of her interview and because
[46:22] I've been here already, it was easy for
[46:24] her to get the interview to get get the
[46:27] visa. So just a few questions, we were
[46:30] told your visa is approved. Amen. Praise
[46:33] God. And here she is ministering. Amen.
[46:39] She's a singer. She was avoiding to
[46:41] sing. I think brother Jeremiah we had to
[46:44] plead for her to sing. But you know uh
[46:46] pastor for for him he didn't ask me. He
[46:49] he just called
[46:52] her even in Malin's he just called her
[46:55] to sing and and that was good because
[46:58] for for for me we went negotiating we
[47:00] brought Jeremiah there to say can you
[47:02] please sing? Can you please sing? So,
[47:05] and and when I was about to call her,
[47:06] she was giving me eyes like don't don't
[47:11] don't. But the pastor in Merlin's just
[47:13] called her and and today he's just
[47:15] called her. So, that's good. That's
[47:17] good. Praise God. Amen. So, we we came
[47:20] by brother David and Sister Hannah in
[47:23] Florida. Yeah. Brother Charlie in
[47:26] introduced me to that family and just
[47:29] the first time we met, hey, it was love
[47:32] at first sight. They were so good people
[47:35] as well. So they
[47:37] uh uh gave us a lot of testimonies and
[47:40] we had a lot of experiences just right
[47:43] in their house. I could see God come
[47:45] down. One of the uh girls received the
[47:50] Holy Ghost right in their house when I
[47:53] was there. They came to visit and uh we
[47:56] started testimonies and testimonies and
[47:59] the Holy Ghost came down right in the
[48:01] house. Amen.
[48:02] And one of the sisters just got baptized
[48:05] of the Holy Ghost in the house. I was
[48:08] like, "Wow, these people, they're so
[48:10] much uh soaked in into the presence of
[48:13] God." And I I I really deemed it a
[48:17] privilege to know them and to interact
[48:19] with them. And uh one of the times when
[48:23] I was there, I think it's last year,
[48:24] then uh uh Daddy Simmons came over. So
[48:28] we met in that house there and and Caleb
[48:31] there. Yes. So that's when I knew him
[48:34] and uh from the time they opened their
[48:36] church, I I've been following a few of
[48:39] their services and I know I saw uh Daddy
[48:42] Simmons was preaching there. So I I
[48:44] followed uh the one life the the sermon
[48:47] that was uh the one life amen that you
[48:50] got to leave. So I enjoyed that. And uh
[48:53] in my interactions with uh uh sister
[48:56] Hana, I really discovered that she's so
[48:59] gifted. And uh one
[49:01] day when I was back home in Zambia, I
[49:04] wanted to call her. But then I thought
[49:07] I'll call her later or something. And
[49:10] then we had a program with her brother
[49:13] uh who has a prophetic gift to go and
[49:15] pray for a sister who had uh serious
[49:18] demons. He prayed for her in the church.
[49:21] But uh he said the battle is not yet
[49:24] done. We need to go to the house. So I
[49:26] went to pick him to take him to the
[49:28] house. I didn't tell him uh we I'll pick
[49:31] you this time. I just called him, "Oh,
[49:33] brother, now I'm coming to pick you up."
[49:34] And and he couldn't tell me. He wasn't
[49:37] ready spiritually. He hadn't prayed
[49:39] enough. He hadn't prepared. And being a
[49:41] prophet, obviously, he saw how big the
[49:44] battle is. So, he needed to be at a
[49:46] certain level in the spirit, but he
[49:48] didn't prepare. So, he then he failed to
[49:51] tell me he didn't prepare. So, I picked
[49:52] him up. And as we were driving towards
[49:54] that house, I told him, "Oh, I had a
[49:57] missed call. there's a certain sister in
[49:58] US but I'll call her later. Then he says
[50:02] something told him tell Jimmy to call
[50:04] that sister. So he told me can can you
[50:08] call that sister in US? I said oh okay
[50:10] let me call. And when I called the phone
[50:13] was on speaker. So the moment she says
[50:16] hello he he said wow this sister is
[50:20] anointed and he went in tonesues. So
[50:24] started speaking in tonesues. Then I had
[50:25] to apologize to sister Hannah. Sorry. Uh
[50:28] uh there's some noise here because
[50:30] somebody's speaking in tongues and and
[50:33] uh he says, "Oh, okay." She says, "Can
[50:35] can I greet him?" I says, "You can't.
[50:36] He's under anointing right now." And uh
[50:39] the brother was went on went on and when
[50:43] we reached uh where we were going, he
[50:45] now calmed down and they chatted with
[50:47] sister Hannah. And right there on the
[50:49] phone, he told her, "Hey, sister, I can
[50:52] see right in your car where you're
[50:54] driving, there's an angel seated with
[50:56] you." Wow. And I said, "Oh, that's
[50:58] beautiful." And then from then on, they
[51:01] they're more friends than I am friends
[51:02] with,
[51:04] sister. They communicate almost every
[51:06] week. And then uh when we went to the
[51:10] deliverance, it was done. It was a walk
[51:13] over. The demons surrendered and they
[51:16] went. And afterwards he told me, he
[51:18] said, "When you picked me up, I wasn't
[51:21] ready to handle those demons. But when I
[51:23] spoke on that phone call with that
[51:25] sister, I tapped anointing from her and
[51:28] my anointing was full enough to go and
[51:30] handle those demons." Wow. Wow. Wow.
[51:33] Wow. So you can really get impartation
[51:37] and anointing just by
[51:40] association. Amen. That's why we come
[51:42] together in the house of God. Amen. And
[51:45] we come to influence one another. You
[51:47] bring your fire. I bring my fire. You
[51:49] bring your fire. It becomes one big
[51:51] fire. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[51:56] Hallelujah. So the services that we came
[51:58] and uh uh attended there for them. I was
[52:02] preaching for them. Preached four
[52:04] services. The the the the anointing was
[52:06] going higher and higher per service. It
[52:09] was so beautiful until the last two
[52:12] services. Hey, hey, hey. We were just on
[52:15] top. God came down so much prophecies
[52:18] were happening. Tongues interpretation
[52:21] and one of the prophecy was about a
[52:23] brother who was supposed to preach and
[52:25] and God spoke to him to say it's your
[52:27] time. God has called you to preach. And
[52:30] the brother testified he had been
[52:32] praying for 2 weeks asking God, "What am
[52:34] I supposed to do in the kingdom of God?
[52:35] What am I supposed to do?" And right
[52:37] there in that service, God spoke and uh
[52:40] and do will you imagine? I was watching
[52:42] their services uh today. That brother
[52:45] was already given to preach I think
[52:47] yesterday and he preached first time
[52:51] like he's been a longtime preacher. It
[52:54] was so nice. I was I was calling her. I
[52:56] was like, "Wow, how I wish I was at that
[52:58] service. How I wish I was at that
[53:00] service." Praise God. But then after
[53:02] that, we went to uh uh Marian for
[53:06] brother uh Jeremiah there. We had a good
[53:09] time. Amen. My my my I couldn't even
[53:12] finish my little sermon. It was little
[53:14] but we I just cut it to littleler
[53:17] because the anointing was already moving
[53:21] and it was nice. And then strangely it's
[53:25] it's the pastor when he was introducing
[53:27] he says Lord may he see the
[53:30] supernatural. I was like, "Really?"
[53:33] Because you pray, "May the supernatural,
[53:36] may the preacher bring the
[53:37] supernatural." But he said, "May the
[53:39] preacher see the supernatural."
[53:42] And and when when when when I came there
[53:44] just before the them picking picking us
[53:46] up, I had a a little dream like very
[53:49] short dream like somebody's telling me,
[53:52] "I need to heal your eyes." And one of
[53:54] my eyes got dim in the dream. and and he
[53:58] he was looking this way and then he
[53:59] turned to look at me and by looking at
[54:02] me he was healing my eye and then he
[54:05] says as you open your eye will be
[54:07] clearer and and when I was opening my
[54:10] eyes I was waking up and then I checked
[54:13] it was time to prepare to go. So I
[54:15] wondered what is this? And when I
[54:17] reached there I spoke about it in the
[54:20] prayer. I said Lord that dream I had if
[54:22] there's anyone who has an eye problem
[54:24] you heal them. And then when the pastor
[54:27] was closing he asked did you say
[54:29] something about the eye? The eye is
[54:32] because I've had eye problem. I've been
[54:34] doing droplets uh in my eyes and I
[54:37] believe that's for me. And and sister
[54:40] the wife says oh even me and she didn't
[54:42] tell the brother. She says, "I had a
[54:45] problem with the right eye." So, Brother
[54:46] Jerma asked me, "Which eye was it?" I
[54:48] said, "It was the right eye." Wow. And I
[54:52] saw the supernatural among you people.
[54:55] Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Yesterday,
[55:00] we went to Malins. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
[55:03] It was fire upon fire and then we heard
[55:07] tongues and a prediction from Nathan.

[1:00:30] My little title this uh evening is
[1:00:35] enforcing a claim to be restored. Amen.
[1:00:39] Amen. Enforcing a claim to be restored.
[1:00:42] Amen. Praise God. Amen. From the
[1:00:45] scripture where we've read, the Lord is
[1:00:49] saying, I will restore. Amen. Praise
[1:00:52] God. Amen. I will restore all the years.
[1:00:56] that will stop the years that the
[1:00:58] locust, the caterpillar, the canoem, the
[1:01:00] palm has eaten. Hallelujah. And uh uh he
[1:01:05] goes on to say that and you shall know
[1:01:07] that I'm in the midst of Israel.
[1:01:11] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:01:14] Jesus. What is to
[1:01:17] restore?
[1:01:19] Restoration
[1:01:20] is to return to the former
[1:01:24] uh owner or to bring back to the former
[1:01:29] a state of condition.
[1:01:32] Amen. And we can enforce a restoration.
[1:01:37] We can enforce a claim of restoration.
[1:01:40] Praise God. And God in his own uh nature
[1:01:44] uh he's already always had has a nature
[1:01:47] to restore. Amen. Beginning just in the
[1:01:51] beginning when man fell when man seen
[1:01:54] the fellowship between God and man was
[1:01:57] disturbed. Praise God. Amen. And right
[1:01:59] there God went into action to restore
[1:02:03] the fellowship. Hallelujah. He went into
[1:02:06] action. He came down. He killed the lamb
[1:02:09] and provided the sacrifice so that the
[1:02:12] restor the the fellowship is restored.
[1:02:15] And throughout the ages, God is a
[1:02:18] restorer. God restores whatever goes
[1:02:21] wrong, he makes it right. Hallelujah.
[1:02:26] Praise God. I'm losing the volume.
[1:02:28] Praise God. Hallelujah. Uh God is a
[1:02:31] restorer. My my my whatever uh gets
[1:02:35] destroyed, he restores. Amen. It is in
[1:02:38] his nature. That's how God is.
[1:02:41] Hallelujah. He puts up something and if
[1:02:44] it gets disturbed, he comes back and
[1:02:47] restores. Praise God. Amen. throughout
[1:02:50] the ages, even when Israel, whenever
[1:02:53] they could fall out with God, maybe they
[1:02:56] seen and they're chased out of the land,
[1:02:58] God will do something to start bringing
[1:03:01] them back into restoration, he'll send a
[1:03:04] a a preacher, maybe a prophet to bring
[1:03:07] them back to God. Praise God. Amen. Even
[1:03:10] in the days of Elijah, when the people
[1:03:12] had gone away from God, God brings a
[1:03:16] restoration. Amen. They restored the
[1:03:19] altar. Praise God. Amen. He's a God of
[1:03:22] restoration. And we are here tonight to
[1:03:24] talk about it. Uh even in the natural,
[1:03:28] God has showed it. Even in nature, there
[1:03:31] is restoration. You cut down a tree,
[1:03:34] come there after some three uh weeks,
[1:03:38] you find it's raising again. Uh there's
[1:03:40] some resurrection happening. Praise God.
[1:03:43] Amen. Even when winter comes uh it's
[1:03:47] death. When uh uh the cold kills the
[1:03:50] things uh by its coldness uh somehow the
[1:03:54] sun comes back again summer uh spring
[1:03:58] comes back again and the sun restores
[1:04:01] whatever was killed. Praise God. Even in
[1:04:04] the spiritual it is the same. Amen. When
[1:04:07] the devil comes in praise God. Amen.
[1:04:10] When the devil comes and brings death uh
[1:04:12] through the denominational spirit uh and
[1:04:15] and he brings death praise God. Amen.
[1:04:18] God does a restoration. Praise God.
[1:04:21] Amen. He's there all the time to restore
[1:04:25] whatever the devil is destroying. Praise
[1:04:27] God. Amen. God is a restorer. Amen. And
[1:04:31] we are here tonight to enforce the
[1:04:34] restoration. We are here tonight uh to
[1:04:36] enforce the restoration. Hallelujah. The
[1:04:40] spirit of God is there to restore
[1:04:43] whatever the enemy destroys. Praise God.
[1:04:46] Amen. We see there was these four
[1:04:49] insects that came and destroyed and ate
[1:04:52] up the blessings of Israel and God says,
[1:04:55] "I will restore." Hallelujah. Praise
[1:04:58] God. Amen. I don't care what the devil
[1:05:00] has done in your life. Amen. God is here
[1:05:04] tonight to say, "I will restore."
[1:05:07] That's why we are here in the house of
[1:05:09] God. We have the authority. We have the
[1:05:12] right uh to bring a restoration to bring
[1:05:15] enforcement of a restoration.
[1:05:17] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:05:20] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God.
[1:05:26] The devil, that's John 10:10, comes
[1:05:30] to kill, to steal, and to destroy. Amen.
[1:05:36] I I was I was just thinking maybe uh uh
[1:05:39] it's looking three stages there where we
[1:05:42] read it was four stages but I I believe
[1:05:45] the fourth stage is the mixture of the
[1:05:47] three stages. The devil comes in these
[1:05:49] four stages three stages and a mixture
[1:05:52] of them. The devil comes to kill to
[1:05:55] steal and to destroy and he sent these
[1:05:58] four stages upon the the church. Amen.
[1:06:02] But God comes to restore. We find even
[1:06:05] in the early church when the church at
[1:06:08] Pentecost it has it was full of power.
[1:06:11] It was full of the reality. It was full
[1:06:14] of the supernatural. And the devil
[1:06:17] doesn't like it that way. When he sees
[1:06:19] the churches on fire when he saw they
[1:06:21] were on fire, the devil came in the form
[1:06:24] of a denominational spirit and came
[1:06:27] riding on the four horse riders.
[1:06:30] Hallelujah. the white horse, black
[1:06:32] horse, red host, and pale host over the
[1:06:35] ages to try to kill what Jesus began.
[1:06:38] Praise God. Amen. But God says, "I will
[1:06:42] restore." Hallelujah. And we see him
[1:06:45] down through the ages. He started the
[1:06:48] restoration. He started pulling the
[1:06:50] church back to the Holy Ghost. And by
[1:06:53] 1906 at Susa Revival, the Holy Ghost
[1:06:57] fell again. Hallelujah. God is a
[1:07:00] restorer. He's here to restore tonight.
[1:07:03] Uh we are here to enforce a restoration.
[1:07:06] We are here to enforce a restoration.
[1:07:09] Hallelujah. Anytime God moves, the devil
[1:07:13] also moves to destroy. But praise God,
[1:07:16] we don't care about the devil's
[1:07:18] destroying power because we know the God
[1:07:20] we save is a restoring God. Hallelujah.
[1:07:25] He's able to restore whatever the enemy
[1:07:28] destroys. Praise God. Amen. And when the
[1:07:31] message came, the church was on fire.
[1:07:34] The things were happening. The
[1:07:36] supernatural was moving. Praise God.
[1:07:38] Amen. But the devil wants to follow
[1:07:41] after the message church to try to kill
[1:07:43] the fire, to try to kill the the move of
[1:07:46] God by using quotations uh by using uh
[1:07:50] uh certain teachings uh trying to push
[1:07:52] out the Holy Ghost from the church.
[1:07:54] Praise God. Amen. But we appreciate the
[1:07:57] Lord. He when the devil comes in like a
[1:07:59] flood, he raises a standard. Praise God.
[1:08:03] Amen. And God has been raising
[1:08:05] standards. Uh men like brother Seans
[1:08:08] standing up for the gospel, standing up
[1:08:11] for the power, standing up for the
[1:08:13] church to be in the Holy Ghost. Uh
[1:08:15] that's the restoration power. The man is
[1:08:18] getting older, but we don't care. We
[1:08:21] know God is raising young men like us to
[1:08:24] come on the scene to keep preaching
[1:08:27] restoration, to keep enforcing the
[1:08:29] restoration. Whatever the devil
[1:08:31] destroys, we are here to push it back.
[1:08:34] Whatever the devil destroys using false
[1:08:37] teachings, we are here to preach the
[1:08:39] correct teachings so that we restore. We
[1:08:42] are here tonight to enforce a
[1:08:45] restoration. We are here tonight to
[1:08:47] enforce a restoration. Whatever the
[1:08:49] devil has destroyed, we are here to
[1:08:52] enforce. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:08:56] God is able to restore. But there's got
[1:08:58] to be a willingness on our part. There's
[1:09:02] something you and I have got to do about
[1:09:04] it. Because if we don't do anything
[1:09:06] about it, it's not going to happen.
[1:09:09] Somebody's got to rise up and enforce.
[1:09:13] We have the right to a lot of things. We
[1:09:16] have the right to the healing. We have a
[1:09:18] right to the power of God. We have a
[1:09:20] right to the gifts. We have a right to
[1:09:22] all that. Even Joshua, he was told.
[1:09:25] Hallelujah. Every place you shall step,
[1:09:28] I give it to you. But it wasn't easy.
[1:09:31] There were there were enemies there.
[1:09:34] There were demons. There were giants
[1:09:35] there. Praise God. Amen. He had to fight
[1:09:38] his way because it is his right. Praise
[1:09:41] God. Amen. Even even us, the devil wants
[1:09:45] to push away the things that are our
[1:09:47] privileges. One time uh uh uh uh uh one
[1:09:51] preacher said uh the the the church is
[1:09:53] living below their privileges, but you
[1:09:56] and I tonight we can come and enforce a
[1:09:59] restoration. Praise God. Amen. Because
[1:10:02] the devil is a squatter. Just like those
[1:10:05] who were staying in the promised land
[1:10:07] who Joshua came to drive out, the devil
[1:10:10] is a squatter. If you don't drive him
[1:10:12] out, he will take advantage of you.
[1:10:14] He'll take advantage of your children.
[1:10:16] He will take advantage of your your
[1:10:18] health. He will take advantage of your
[1:10:20] gift. Hallelujah. Until some of you,
[1:10:23] maybe you were seeing visions, but over
[1:10:26] the years he has eaten it away. Maybe
[1:10:29] some of you were prophesying, maybe you
[1:10:31] were speaking in tongues, maybe you were
[1:10:33] testifying, and the devil has been
[1:10:35] eating that away. But praise God, we are
[1:10:38] back tonight in the house of God. We are
[1:10:41] here to enforce a claim.
[1:10:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Restore us, oh
[1:10:47] God. Restore the church, oh God. Restore
[1:10:51] the believer, oh God.
[1:10:53] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. We are
[1:10:56] here to enforce. The devil is a
[1:10:58] squatter. We got to send him sermons.
[1:11:01] And the Holy Ghost will enforce it. The
[1:11:04] Holy Ghost is a policeman who will come
[1:11:07] to this devil that is sitting on your
[1:11:10] property. He will come and say, "You
[1:11:12] devil, you got to get out."
[1:11:15] Hallelujah. I don't care what sickness
[1:11:18] that can be upon you. It is sitting on
[1:11:20] your health. And the devil is saying,
[1:11:23] "I'll sit here. I'm not going to go
[1:11:25] away." But devil, you are a squatter.
[1:11:28] You are just a squatter. We You don't
[1:11:31] have the legal right to stay upon the
[1:11:33] believers. You don't have a legal right
[1:11:36] to hold the gift of a believer. You
[1:11:38] don't have a legal right in the name of
[1:11:41] Jesus. As a servant of God, I command
[1:11:44] you, get
[1:11:46] out.
[1:11:49] Hallelujah. The devil's got to go. He's
[1:11:52] got to go. He has no place. He's been
[1:11:56] holding you, but he's in illegal. Amen.
[1:12:00] He's a squatter. We are here tonight to
[1:12:04] serve him sermons by the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:07] Satan, your time is up. You got to get
[1:12:10] out. Hallelujah. Maybe he's holding your
[1:12:14] children. They can't come to church. I'm
[1:12:17] here to tell you, we have the authority
[1:12:20] by the word of God to tell the devil,
[1:12:23] "Let go of my children. Let go of the
[1:12:26] children. Let go of the children in the
[1:12:29] name of Jesus. Satan, get out. You are a
[1:12:33] squatter. You got to go. Praise God.
[1:12:36] Amen. Hallelujah. There are some altars
[1:12:41] that are speaking against you. Altars of
[1:12:43] witches. They're saying she's not going
[1:12:46] to get married. She's not going to be
[1:12:48] prosperous in her business. But we are
[1:12:50] here tonight to serve them sermons in
[1:12:53] the name of Jesus Christ. Oh, such
[1:12:56] altars. Holy Ghost fire, Holy
[1:13:01] Ghost, Holy
[1:13:03] Ghost, Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. The devil
[1:13:07] got to get out. We are here to enforce a
[1:13:11] restoration. God promised us it's our
[1:13:14] privilege and we are not going to be
[1:13:16] below our privilege. We are going to be
[1:13:18] above. We are going to enjoy our
[1:13:20] healing. We are going to enjoy our joy.
[1:13:23] We are going to enjoy our peace. We are
[1:13:26] going to enjoy the fire. Come on.
[1:13:29] Receive the fire. Receive the fire.
[1:13:33] Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive the
[1:13:36] power. Oh, I feel the power moving. I
[1:13:39] feel the power moving. I feel the power
[1:13:42] moving in the building. Oh, Jesus is

[1:15:28] anointed. Oh, until they could take
[1:15:31] clothes from Paul and lay it on the sick
