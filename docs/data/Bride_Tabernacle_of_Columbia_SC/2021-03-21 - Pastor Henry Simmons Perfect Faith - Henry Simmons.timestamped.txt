[35:48] mark 11 22 we thank god again
[35:52] i'll tell you i was just listening to
[35:56] the prophet
[35:56] concerning perfect faith and i was in
[36:00] pain
[36:02] and i began to meditate on
[36:06] that word and as i began to meditate on
[36:10] the word i said i'm not gonna let
[36:14] feeling pain discourage me
[36:19] and i just kept on believing and kept on
[36:21] trusting
[36:24] until the pain went away god is good
[36:27] isn't that right
[36:29] i i said he's the same god amen what he
[36:33] did yesterday he's still doing today
[36:36] god never changed amen
[36:41] mark 11 22.
[36:44] jesus asking and said unto them have
[36:47] what
[36:48] have faith in god that's what we're
[36:50] saying this morning perfect faith
[36:52] have faith in god
[36:55] for verily i say unto you that
[36:59] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[37:03] be thou removed think about your
[37:05] mountain this morning
[37:07] well he said whosoever will you say it
[37:11] to your mountain be thou removed
[37:15] amen for whosoever will say unto this
[37:18] mountain
[37:20] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[37:22] the sea and shall not what
[37:25] thou where in his heart
[37:29] but shall believe that those things
[37:32] which he what
[37:35] which he shall
[37:38] believe that those things which he
[37:44] said shall what
[37:47] he what he should have whatsoever
[37:55] is that right does it work today
[37:59] can god do it today
[38:02] same yesterday today and win
[38:05] oh god is the same therefore i say unto
[38:08] you
[38:08] what things so ever ye
[38:12] what when you pray believe that what
[38:18] that you what have you been praying
[38:22] lately
[38:24] believe that you received them and what
[38:29] you should have them amen
[38:33] and when you stand praying what
[38:38] if you have ought against any that your
[38:41] father
[38:43] also which is in heaven
[38:46] may forgive you your trespass but if you
[38:49] do not forgive
[38:52] neither will your father which is in
[38:54] heaven
[38:55] forgive your trespass god bless you
[38:57] renewed word
[38:59] so faith is based off of what
[39:02] forgiveness
[39:04] [Music]
[39:05] faith is based off of forgiveness
[39:09] if you have faith in god then you must
[39:12] be
[39:13] willing and able to forgive
[39:18] now how many things that
[39:22] you think god has forgiven you of
[39:25] because if you're not willing to forgive
[39:27] your brother or your sister
[39:30] then how you were expecting god to
[39:32] forgive you
[39:34] are you with me and how can you fully
[39:37] have faith in god
[39:39] when you don't have a forgiving heart
[39:44] if faith is based off of forgiveness
[39:48] are you with me so many times
[39:52] uh we have imaginary faith
[39:58] we imagine that we believe
[40:02] and then we presume that we believe
[40:06] that means we venture without authority
[40:10] we imagine
[40:13] and imagination is not faith
[40:17] what you imagine is not faith so i used
[40:20] a little sub topic this morning called
[40:23] real faith i mean
[40:26] faith is real
[40:29] a real faith faith is real amen
[40:34] now in reality we know
[40:37] that seeing a sight is real isn't that
[40:40] right
[40:41] how do you know the sight is real
[40:43] because i'm looking at y'all
[40:46] and i can see y'all right so we can
[40:50] decline
[40:52] sight or sin as being real
[40:56] because i can see
[41:00] the lights on isn't that right
[41:03] and we all that have eyes
[41:07] and can see you can have eyes and not be
[41:09] able to see isn't that right
[41:12] but we that have eyes and the ability to
[41:15] see
[41:17] you can anybody tell you that the seats
[41:20] that you
[41:20] oh some people can be colorblind
[41:23] thought about my brother-in-law use
[41:25] colorblind you can look at these seats
[41:28] and you can declare that these seats are
[41:32] white
[41:34] huh
[41:37] by seeing these seats you can declare
[41:40] that they are what
[41:43] white they blew how do you know that
[41:47] they're blue
[41:49] because you see them right
[41:53] you see that these seats are blue isn't
[41:57] that right
[41:58] so if i told you the seats are white
[42:02] amen your sense of sight tells you
[42:05] that they are blue isn't that right
[42:09] so you're not going to let me tell you
[42:11] that these seats are white
[42:13] when your sense of sin declares that
[42:16] they are blue
[42:18] isn't that right so
[42:22] you you're trusting in the ability of
[42:24] your sight
[42:25] amen and you know your sight is real
[42:30] are you a man
[42:33] now
[42:36] your sense of touch a
[42:40] feel you know that's real why
[42:45] amen because you can touch somebody just
[42:48] touch
[42:49] a part of your body
[42:52] you feel it right you know that's real
[42:55] all of these senses that we declare
[42:58] to be real because we can exercise
[43:02] they're manifested
[43:04] amen by you using those senses those
[43:08] five senses
[43:09] but the sixth sense which is faith
[43:14] amen it's just as real
[43:17] as any of the five senses
[43:20] because hebrews 11 says 11 and 1
[43:24] says now faith is the what
[43:29] so faith is a substance it's something
[43:33] that is just as real or more
[43:36] real than the five senses
[43:40] so we're talking about perfect faith
[43:44] the prophet of god said we're coming up
[43:45] a little higher that we can get into
[43:47] rapture and faith and so forth
[43:50] we're going into a deeper understanding
[43:53] of faith
[43:54] because we're going to need that to get
[43:55] raptured out of here
[43:58] are you with me so we need to understand
[44:02] amen faith amen and not just
[44:05] imagine that we have it and think we got
[44:08] it when we need
[44:09] rapture and faith and perfect faith
[44:13] is real okay
[44:17] so um this perfect faith let's go to
[44:21] romans 10.
[44:24] perfect faith romans 10
[44:30] because the devil he'll try to make you
[44:33] doubt
[44:34] whether or not this faith is real
[44:38] the devil will always work on your
[44:41] conscience your imagination your memory
[44:43] and he'll work
[44:46] you're trying to get you to reason all
[44:49] kinds of things but once you
[44:51] have perfect faith it's an ankle
[44:56] you you become anchored you know a lot
[44:59] of people
[45:00] are not certain of the even their
[45:02] salvation
[45:04] they're not certain they they they they
[45:07] say one day and tomorrow
[45:09] they don't know whether they're saved
[45:11] some folk are here one day
[45:13] and tomorrow they they're not healed and
[45:16] some folk
[45:17] you know people are somewhat puzzled
[45:21] but once you're anchored and you know
[45:24] that god
[45:25] saved you some folk can say i know god
[45:29] saved me because
[45:30] i used to be a drug addict i used to be
[45:32] an alcoholic i used to be
[45:34] uh an adulterer a fornicator i used to
[45:37] do all kinds of
[45:38] rotten stuff but i don't i know god
[45:41] christ came into my life and saved me
[45:43] now notice what he said in isaiah 53
[45:48] uh for he was wounded for our what
[45:51] trans aggression just as much as that's
[45:54] real that we believe that god so loved
[45:58] the world that he gave his only begotten
[46:00] son whosoever believing them should not
[46:02] perish
[46:02] but have everlasting life we believe in
[46:04] the reality of
[46:06] god amen
[46:09] dying on the cross and by faith we
[46:12] receive
[46:14] the forgiveness of sin we know that
[46:17] jesus
[46:18] forgave us of our sin and we accepted
[46:22] that
[46:22] fact that jesus died for my sin
[46:26] and if i accept what he died for then i
[46:30] am saved and our lives
[46:34] spontaneously changes
[46:38] the places that we used to go we don't
[46:40] go no more
[46:42] things we used to do we don't even know
[46:44] them anymore why
[46:46] because christ has come into our lives
[46:49] and we are saved
[46:51] and the manifestation of uh and the
[46:54] proof that we are saved
[46:56] amen is that god has changed our lives
[47:01] are you with me and and we give the
[47:05] credit
[47:06] to jesus and what he did for us when he
[47:09] died on the cross
[47:10] at calvary isn't that right and that's a
[47:13] reality can anybody tell you
[47:15] you're not saved well i you know
[47:18] sometimes the
[47:19] christians get down the road a long ways
[47:22] down the road and sometimes they say
[47:24] they doubt their salvation
[47:27] it's just like uh israel when they came
[47:31] out of egypt and all the miracles all
[47:33] the signs and all the wonders
[47:35] they doubted you know we could have
[47:37] stayed back down in egypt we were better
[47:39] off
[47:41] israel came out of bondage and all the
[47:43] deliverance yet
[47:45] they said let us go back to egypt
[47:49] for we were better off in this
[47:50] wilderness
[47:52] you see how how folks can it doesn't
[47:56] matter
[47:56] what god does the devil would always try
[47:59] to pursue you
[48:01] he tried to pursue them not to live with
[48:04] pharaoh
[48:04] army but he pursued them mentally
[48:08] in their minds are you with me
[48:12] he said they all perished in the
[48:14] wilderness because
[48:16] of what unbelief
[48:19] after saving the people they meant
[48:21] afterwards they were destroyed
[48:23] because of unbelief brother and sister
[48:26] you lose out when
[48:28] your faith got to be anchored
[48:32] we're talk about real genuine faith
[48:36] that ankles your soul amen not something
[48:40] that you believe
[48:42] amen you presume that you have something
[48:44] that you know you got
[48:47] and nobody gonna talk you out of it
[48:50] you'll let no the bible said resist the
[48:52] devil and hear what
[48:54] he'll flee from you isn't that right
[48:57] you must aim anything contrary
[49:01] to what to what god says in his word
[49:05] anything contrary to that do what
[49:08] resistance casting down
[49:12] imagination and every hot thing that
[49:15] would what
[49:16] i'm teaching this morning i i i might
[49:18] preach but i
[49:19] i'm teaching are you with me every
[49:22] imagination
[49:23] that would exalt itself against what
[49:27] the word of god the knowledge of god
[49:30] now i want you to know that amen
[49:34] your resistance of the devil is your
[49:36] revelation that you have
[49:38] of what god has done for you
[49:41] amen once you've got a true revelation
[49:44] of your salvation
[49:45] then no devil in hell can talk you out
[49:48] of it no circumstances no condition
[49:51] no oh hallelujah nothing that could come
[49:55] nothing that can go no depth no height
[49:57] no what
[50:00] oh life death principalities power
[50:03] nothing can take away amen what jesus
[50:05] has done for you because your faith is
[50:07] ain't correct
[50:09] i know jesus died on the cross
[50:12] shedding his blood and my sins are
[50:15] forgiven
[50:16] not because of what i've done it's
[50:18] because of what he's done for me
[50:22] amen i just happen to believe it and
[50:25] receive it
[50:27] and as much as we can believe and
[50:29] receive
[50:30] for our salvation then we can believe
[50:33] and receive
[50:34] because he was wounded father
[50:36] transgression bruised foreign
[50:41] i have peace brother and sister if you
[50:44] don't have
[50:44] peace in your down amend what he did
[50:48] for you when he was wounded the peace
[50:52] i give you not as the world give give
[50:55] are you amen you can have
[50:58] peace this morning because that's what
[51:01] jesus
[51:02] purchased for you with his blood
[51:04] [Music]
[51:05] amen just talking about peace
[51:09] was upon him and with his
[51:12] brother and sister so many people are
[51:14] sick
[51:15] and living beneath their privileges
[51:19] is because amen they think they believe
[51:24] they presume that they believe they
[51:26] imagine that they believe
[51:29] amen but god's servant god prophet said
[51:31] you got to know
[51:33] your position
[51:37] you got to know your position
[51:41] and when you're out of position you're
[51:44] out of the words
[51:46] amen but want to believe or understands
[51:50] and knows their position
[51:52] in the word praise god no devil
[51:56] amen can defeat you
[52:00] amen praise god knowing your position i
[52:04] i i said 10.
[52:06] now here's in 17th verse romans 10
[52:09] 17 it says so then faith come by
[52:16] so how do i get faith faith come by what
[52:20] not something that i imagine not
[52:23] something that i
[52:24] see amen
[52:27] it's what i hear faith come by
[52:30] hearing if you believe what you hear and
[52:34] hearing come by what
[52:37] hearing come by the word of god
[52:40] amen so if i hear what the word says
[52:44] and isaiah 53 then i can trust what god
[52:47] said about it
[52:50] and if i amen if i believe what god said
[52:53] about it
[52:54] then it doesn't make a difference what
[52:56] who else says about it
[52:58] because i accepted what god said about
[53:00] it
[53:02] and what god said about you and what god
[53:05] said about your healing
[53:06] it's sure it's steadfast it's an anchor
[53:09] to the soul
[53:11] brother sister no devil in hell can talk
[53:14] you out of it
[53:15] amen because you must as an individual
[53:18] have your own personal revelation you
[53:22] must hear the voice of god
[53:23] speak to your heart and go down into
[53:26] your spirit man
[53:28] and energize your faith amen and brings
[53:31] up a manifestation of reality to you
[53:35] amen so what happens amen
[53:38] [Music]
[53:40] it's not a potential acorn it's a
[53:43] potential oak tree
[53:44] but real faith has it oak tree
[53:48] not the potential but the real faith
[53:51] genuine faith
[53:52] i have an oak tree not an acorn but i
[53:56] have the tree
[53:57] [Music]
[53:58] are you with me so i'm not potentially
[54:02] uh oak tree i have the oak tree
[54:07] see a lot of times we have the potential
[54:09] but we don't have
[54:10] the tree itself
[54:13] [Music]
[54:14] amen so we are believing for the oak
[54:17] tree but we don't have the oak tree as a
[54:19] yet
[54:20] but you must real genuine faith brings
[54:23] into the manifestation that i have
[54:25] the oak tree praise god i'm not waiting
[54:29] on the oak tree
[54:30] but i have the oak tree
[54:34] what am i saying i have my healing now
[54:39] i'm not waiting to be here i am healed
[54:44] amen i'm not waiting to see whether or
[54:46] not the pain is going to go away
[54:49] the pain has gone away
[54:52] i'm not waiting on the doctor to tell me
[54:54] my cancer is gone
[54:56] the cancer is gone because the word has
[54:58] declared the cancer goal
[55:01] can the cancer stand against god's word
[55:06] the word said the cancer is gone so who
[55:10] who should believe our report amen
[55:15] who whose report uh who who
[55:18] who are you going to believe the word
[55:22] of what what's out there
[55:26] in the atmosphere if you believe the
[55:29] word then you must
[55:30] know amen it doesn't matter the
[55:33] condition abraham the bible said
[55:35] he staggered not amen
[55:39] 99 years old but he staggered
[55:43] not amen why because he had
[55:48] perfect faith in what god had declared
[55:51] amen so i'm going to the bible said he
[55:54] became stronger
[55:57] amen because he knew that what god has
[55:59] promised god was able
[56:02] to perform god you
[56:06] you said and amen i can stand ashore
[56:09] you said brother simmers if you speak
[56:12] faith like that then nobody gets sick
[56:15] nobody'll die
[56:16] oh brother we're on that road
[56:19] we're on that road amen where we going
[56:22] we're talking about rapturing faith
[56:24] we're talking about getting out of here

[56:32] the church the bride is moving on
[56:35] we're moving on where are we going
[56:38] amen praise god you know it's something
[56:42] about the disciples having the
[56:44] power of god they could not heal
[56:47] the man's son amen that he said and he
[56:50] brought him to jesus he said i brought
[56:52] him to your disciples
[56:53] but they could not do it the disciples
[56:56] had power
[56:59] amen we could have uh
[57:02] you know uh uh a bullet uh
[57:07] and and and though we got the bullet the
[57:10] bullet
[57:10] you know and got the power and all that
[57:13] but we got to put it in the gun
[57:16] and ignite it all you would
[57:20] and then it goes off amen
[57:24] then the disciples had power
[57:27] but they didn't have faith to ignite the
[57:30] power
[57:32] are you with me you can have
[57:35] power say i got the holy ghost i got
[57:39] power but i don't have faith to operate
[57:43] are you with me you must have faith to
[57:46] operate the power
[57:48] [Music]
[57:50] are you and god is bringing that to a
[57:53] special bride
[57:55] chosen people faith to operate the power
[57:58] of god

[58:04] know that you are amateur creators your
[58:06] little messiah rats
[58:08] are you with me and god i'm talking
[58:11] about

[58:31] and something tell me you you you can't
[58:35] you're in too much pain to walk

[58:50] you know sometimes you're in so much
[58:52] pain you
[58:53] hobbling so i said i i'm refusing
[58:58] why because i was acting on perfect
[59:00] faith
[59:02] so me acting on perfect faith i began to
[59:04] walk
[59:06] i i began to do what i couldn't do uh
[59:09] prior
[59:11] i said i'm walking i'm walking in
[59:14] perfect faith
[59:16] and i had to just not just uh have an
[59:19] imagination
[59:21] but i had to say god your word said
[59:25] and i'm walking in perfect faith
[59:28] amen i'm not walking with how i feel
[59:31] because if i
[59:32] feel i i would sat down but i'm walking
[59:34] in perfect faith
[59:37] amen my feeling amen is not i i'm not
[59:40] dealing with what i how i feel
[59:42] but i'm walking in perfect faith
[59:46] i'm walking without a limp
[59:49] i'm not feeling the pain no more
[59:52] amen praise god so the devil has no
[59:55] i'm resisting the pain i'm telling the
[59:58] devil amen i'm not accepting the pain no
[1:00:01] more
[1:00:02] i'm walking in perfect faith amen if i'm
[1:00:06] gonna have perfect faith
[1:00:07] it's time now for a manifestation of it
[1:00:11] amen so god manifests what you said in
[1:00:14] your word
[1:00:15] amen if i got it then let me use it
[1:00:19] amen the disciples did not have the holy
[1:00:22] ghost
[1:00:23] yet to have this perfect faith then we
[1:00:26] need the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:28] are you with me so they brought him to
[1:00:31] jesus amen
[1:00:32] and jesus said this can't come about but
[1:00:36] by fasting in prayer
[1:00:38] are you with me but if they had perfect
[1:00:41] faith
[1:00:42] amen then they they say he said because
[1:00:45] of your unbelief
[1:00:48] are you with me it's it's something
[1:00:51] about it was something that they did not
[1:00:53] believe
[1:00:54] amen and because they couldn't believe
[1:00:57] it enough that they could cast those
[1:00:59] devils out
[1:01:00] they meant those devils would not come
[1:01:02] out those devils got an intelligent
[1:01:06] is it like a dog got a little sense amen
[1:01:09] it knows whether you're scared of him or
[1:01:11] not
[1:01:12] and you can't bluff that dog
[1:01:15] amen he knows what you're afraid and
[1:01:18] when he gets you scared and you say well
[1:01:20] i ain't scared of you
[1:01:22] and then you jump and that dog jumped
[1:01:24] back at you and you oh
[1:01:25] you got to run amen
[1:01:29] see that devil amen he wants to make you
[1:01:32] jump
[1:01:34] amen you got to say boo devil
[1:01:37] i said boo and that devil knows what you
[1:01:41] mean business when you said boo devil

[1:01:45] getting smaller
[1:01:47] your mountain is coming down amen you
[1:01:50] set buddha
[1:01:52] amen your mountain your situation is
[1:01:55] changing now
[1:01:57] i believe situations are changing right
[1:01:59] now
[1:02:00] in the building situations are changing
[1:02:03] right now
[1:02:04] amen because you're creating an
[1:02:06] atmosphere for change
[1:02:09] you're recognizing your position in
[1:02:11] christ
[1:02:12] jesus knew who he was so the devil could
[1:02:15] not say
[1:02:16] i i assure you all the kingdoms that the
[1:02:17] word of you by now he knew his position
[1:02:21] he knew who he was and he knowing who he
[1:02:24] was
[1:02:24] strictly amen he was able to manifest
[1:02:28] what the word says about him
[1:02:30] amen he knew what the word said about
[1:02:33] him so he was able
[1:02:34] to stand on that word because he knew
[1:02:37] the word declared him to be the son of
[1:02:39] god
[1:02:41] and the word said when he come what do
[1:02:43] you do
[1:02:45] and he was not worried about he meant
[1:02:48] trying to work up
[1:02:49] something it was not something he was
[1:02:52] guessing on
[1:02:53] it was not something that he was
[1:02:55] imagining he wasn't worried
[1:02:58] he was god so he wasn't trying
[1:03:02] to be god he wasn't trying to work up to
[1:03:04] be something that he wasn't
[1:03:07] now you must recognize your position
[1:03:10] recognizing who you are it's nothing
[1:03:13] that you imagine
[1:03:14] amen nothing that you got to work up oh
[1:03:17] oh i wonder i wonder i wonder if i am
[1:03:21] who god said i am are you
[1:03:24] are you thinking sometimes amen maybe
[1:03:28] amen something is missing amen
[1:03:31] am i who god says i am or are you
[1:03:34] certain of god
[1:03:36] the brother god said you must be certain
[1:03:38] of god as an individual
[1:03:40] you must be certain of god and if you
[1:03:42] are certain of god
[1:03:43] then you know that the promises of god
[1:03:45] are yeah and not nay
[1:03:48] and you you know you can have what god
[1:03:50] said is yours
[1:03:52] are you with me if god amen you must
