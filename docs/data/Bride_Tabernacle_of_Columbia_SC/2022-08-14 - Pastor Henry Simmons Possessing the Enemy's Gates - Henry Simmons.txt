i'll read the first you read the next and it came to pass that after these things god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold he am i too and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his eyes and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and [Music] and clay wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went into the place of which god had told him for and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with this with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you 6. and i respect unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said beca behold the fire and wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering 8. and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built and altered there and laid the wood in order and bound eyes at his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood 10. and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i 12. and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horn and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son 14. and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time 16. together that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed in the stars of heaven and as the sand upon she shall and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy may god bless you toward you you may be seated and we wanted to talk this morning about possessing the gates of his enemy it's a many things that we were reading that could be brought out this morning but uh possessing the gates of the enemy and we oftentimes tell us our greatest enemy that we're looking at you know back then it was talking about they had to go and possess land and so forth and the enemies would come against uh them and they would have to fight the enemy such as going into battle at jericho and different places and and god would give him victory over the enemy so by the grace of god possessing the gates of your enemy that he told joshua is that your enemies would not be able to stand before you and so by the grace of god we understand that the gates that we were dealing with you know through the week we were talking about the gates of the spirit you know like the body the soul in the spirit we're talking about those gates and possessing the gates of the enemy we're talking about when we deal with the body smell taste hair feel and so forth and then we were talking about in the spirit realm we'll talk about affection conscious memory and so forth and imagination and so affection so those gates and in the soul we're talking about either faith or doubt either you believe god or you doubt it amen and we find out that down in our soul down in the inner man amen if we're really saving we're really a believer of jesus christ then that causes all these other uh imagination conscious memory and even our taste is subject then we bring those under subjection to the spirit amen if we have the holy ghost then of the works of the flesh amen those things that will work against the spirit of god the flesh walls against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh are you with me so we are constantly battling the will of god in our own will what we want and what god wants amen what this flesh wants amen the bible says you know concerning the works of the flesh amen the different things that the flesh desires is not the things that would please god but it would please the flesh and the and the flesh amen is inspired by the devil the devil had you know that's the works of the flesh we're talking about the lusts of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life these things are not of the father but of the world so we're dealing with those things constantly amen what we see amen lust of the flesh what we desire amen that's against the word amen somebody might desire amen because they see it amen and it belongs to somebody else they'll steal somebody a teal for something that belongs to somebody else oh you look man so we'll find that not only not we desire somebody else wife somebody else husband which is against god are you with me so people to have desires they meant that they want to please themselves and not god so those gates amen that we must possess the enemy gate now he said to abraham he said thou see shall possess the gates of the enemy we're talking about the seed of abraham now who is the seed of abraham let's go to galatians 3 16 quickly and as we go to galatians 3 16. galatians 3 16. he says not abraham and his seed word what the promise made he said not unto seeds as of what but as a warm and to thy seed which is what christ so christ was to possess the gates of the enemy now with the bible said the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death death is an enemy to you the bible says there's no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear for fear is of the devil and it has torment so the love of god which is the baptism of the holy ghost that shed it brought in our heart it catches our fear are you with me so the thing amen the devil uses fear against faith but we must your children abraham see the children of faith amen that believe the word regardless of what amen regardless of what we see regardless of how we feel the word of god because we are children of faith faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of god so we have victory in amen but trusting in god unfailing words now as galatians 3 here um in in 26 he said i read 25 galatians 3 and 25 and but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster for ye are all what now how do you become a children a child of god by what faith in what now you say well i it doesn't you know sometimes our lack of interest in in god and understanding who we are amen because we want to be who we want to be amen it doesn't make a difference what god wants us to be we want to be who we want to be so it's not god i i i'm here in this earth it meant doing my thing whatever i'm pleased to do amen it's not what you will why am i in the earth why was i born and what am i doing in this place amen people are not interested in discovering where they come from and where they're going and why they're here for but a short time what is my purpose and what is my journey all about some people just don't care because they just gonna do whatever i seem whatever seemed right in my eyes and i'm gonna live and die not knowing that life is but a vapors here today is gone tomorrow you may be strong today but you may be weak tomorrow are you with me it doesn't matter how you think about what you think about yourself amen you're nothing jesus said without me you can you can you can't do a thing you can't even wake up in the morning but we take our life as though we're it's we have control of it but not knowing we're either under the control of the devil or we're under control of god are you with me the devil amen becomes your father or your master uh uh god becomes amen your ruler amen and the god oh you look man so the one that rules over you amen how do you know who's got the rule who's got the preeminence over you by the one look at your life by the way you live amen yo the things that you desire amen do you desire to please god or do you desire how to please yourself yourself it ain't about pleasing yourself it's about obeying the evil one okay so he says you're children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you that have been what the 27th verse but many of you that have been baptized into christ have what you put on christ now the bible said by one spirit are we baptized into one body you know as we said except a man be born again he cannot enter the kingdom of god so we're not the baptism of the holy ghost amen we're just potentially children of god but the holy ghost put you into the body amen if you want to be in the kingdom of god then you got to be born in it you cannot just say well i believe and i'm there the bible says have you received the holy ghost since you believe it means simply believing is just the starting point but you got to continue to believe because he said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved amen because if we say we believe and don't get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen then somewhere the bible said after he saved the people out of the land of egypt he destroyed them because of unbelief they meant so god amen it's not enough just to say i believe amen and don't keep believing but god i've got to get back to my subject but possessing the enemy gate but god has a test after the trial then we prosestigate some enemy after we've been tested see the the the test of your faith the trine of your faith your faith has to be tested to see whether it's genuine what is real amen whether you you mean it it has to be proven god allows us to be tested and proven so it says many of us are baptized in christ have put on christ there's neither jew the greek that needs to born they're free they're neither male nor female but here all what one in christ jesus and if ye be christ then you are what now so i'm talking about you that you know have been baptized in the body then you are abraham's seed now and god says abraham i'm going to bless you amen and you know i wrote something down blessing in the testing god bless you in your testing what you presently are seeing what you're presently going through you don't see your blessing sometimes he said no suffering of this present time seemed to be glorious but there's a blessing the test amen so what happens amen abraham did not know amen he had done a lot of things amen abraham had come a long way praise god and and in in coming a long way abraham must have felt like amen praise god i've i left my father played a house and i left my home left my land i left everything i had and i come to follow jesus amen i left everything to follow him and here i am i don't know where i'm going but all i know god said i want you to abraham i want you to leave your country i want you to leave where you've been brought up and i want you to uh follow me amen abraham didn't know where it was going he he's adjourned as a stranger and see sometimes god i asked you to do something that you don't understand but he meant something about god when he's speaking to you he don't have to tell you why and what you know and that's what happens because god don't tell you amen what he's going to do for you and what he's going to do to you amen sometimes i want to know all about what you're talking about before i make a move and i want to see whether or not i want to do it or not amen so god he don't have to do that with us he don't have to prove to us anything all he does he says abraham i want you to leave i want you to come out from your country you know sometimes he said okay i died not now what did i do it for you know we get an attitude lord i gave you i i i accepted you as my person to save it and lord you came into my life and lord thank you amen praise god now amen because i i i i i left my friends and amen and i left the things that i used to do but lord i i i'm done enough see sometimes we think we've already done enough to be satisfied amen now amen god you know abraham's journey and he took lot with him and okay lot come on god didn't tell him to take a lot but he took life because abraham didn't have no children are you what man so uh let me take a lot alone with me but after a while amen god started blessing abraham and blessing a lot and and it came to time that god says you gotta you gotta get rid of this lot i ain't got no children there like my son you know so you had to get rid of a lot separated from life so here it must have caused a lot of hurt and then look like god promised that i'm gonna bless you and i'm gonna give you a son and a child but look like it ain't coming so hey god you know you you know he was convinced to you know have a child i hate god and ishmael then god took that child go on separate it's different things that god comes in our lives and amen even when our failure and our mistakes god allows it sometimes but yet god has to test you prove you and he's taking you on a journey and sometimes when we on that journey god does not explain to you all about it you know you know sometimes we want to know the end of it before we start before i start on the journey i want to know amen the end amen and life is not like that you know sometimes you you have to trust god to navigate you through life just it meant to be amen the one that's going to lead you amen to green pastures amen sometimes you got to go through the violent shadows of death to get to that pasture but god is leading you in the midst of all your troubles god leads and god dies and sometimes we don't understand it because we don't understand we we're not going to move but abraham must have had something in him it must have was something about abraham that he believed god and you know it comes crucial points in our lives crucial times critical times in our life and god asks us to do something that we don't want to do and sometimes the thing that we love the most goddesses i want you to give that up yeah some of us love different things it might be a companion it might be or a friend might be you know who you hang out with it might be uh you know it could be something that would cause you to displease god but you you may not understand it where god is taking you to a better place he's taking you higher in the spirit he's he's actually trying to establish you strengthen you he's trying to make you stronger but you know we just don't start off almost running a mile we might run you know we might walk a mile first and god takes us to different levels to make us strong in faith it takes us through different avenues to strengthen our faith and sometimes things that god allows to happen in your life amen it causes you to wander and causes you to think it causes you to uh want to say god why am i going through this i've seen so many young people just turn around and and not serve god because amen they don't see the progress in their lives and they don't see the reason for them not doing like the rest of the folk and why should i be taken advantage of i don't see amen why why am i being amen uh i can't have what the rest of them have why i can't do and have fun and have pleasure like the rest of the other young people why why why why am i victimized why am i gonna do without and they're having fun and they you know why why you want me to do that god explain to me why can you see some explain to me why mama dad explained to me why if you can't tell me why then i do what i want to do and and then i you know i might not let you know but i'ma do it because why i want to know why not and and sometimes we feel like we're in prison god you is not going to make a prisoner of me that i can't do this and i can't do that and i i'm not going to be a prisoner for nobody i'm going to be free free to do what i want to do free to live like i want to live free free from everybody free from parents free from love you know are we really free when we're free are we really free okay we free just go down 35 miles an hour and just go 50 if you want a hundred the sign says 35 free okay you're free go to school and you're free but you got to have some type of respect for those that are trying to teach you are you with me but you you you have to be subject enough and you know i said lord you know what happens people don't respect anybody almost respect has been gone from society when people can disrespect any anybody that's have any kind of authority at all people disrespect authority so what it when it comes down to because the children disrespect the parents the parents disrespect god are you open but the parents want the children to respect them but they don't respect the word of god are you with me i didn't mean to go there but by the grace of god let me go back to protesting against an enemy but respect goes a long way being humble you tell the teacher teacher why are you teaching me this way why are you saying that i should learn algebra what i'm gonna do with it i don't need it anyhow not what i'm gonna do what why i need to learn these terminologies that i'm not gonna use and sometimes they say okay if you want your degree then you're gonna learn it you're gonna go through it well i'm going through all of this just to get a degree but what is the degree going to do for you oftentimes it's going to get you what a better job are you with me so if i got to go through this to get what i want see what i'm saying what god has given to you amen sometimes we have to go through certain things to get what god has in store for us god wants to bless us but we can't get the blessed until we pass the test are you with but sometimes we just think that if i'm not blessed i ain't gonna do nothing you know i looked at job he had to be test did and i said how many times you probably thought that job he lost his cattle he lost his camels he lost everything then he came to it he lost his children and now he says job said naked came out to the world next shall i return the lord give it to the lord take it away what blessed be the name of the lord amen i'm talking about joe probably you know you know what what do we say i i i've been through enough it's enough i i can't take it no more sometimes the things that we suffer in our bodies and sometimes the things we suffer through life we say it's enough i've been through enough i'm tired you know young people give up at the early age they blow their brains out why because they thought i can't take it no more because i don't take it because i don't understand it so we find that people do they just go out and they just i'm going to take a drink i'm going to take i'm going to smoke or join i'm going to do anything because i can't take it or they don't know where you're coming from it's a rebellion against amen the rebellion against the ways of god and the plan of god for their lives they don't want god's plan they rebel against it so i'm gonna do something in rebellion lord i i don't want this this is not what i want i want to do my thing so i rebel against god and in rebellion we actually do more hurt and damage to our own lives we're not hurting god because whatever god asks us to do he just want to take us and bless us amen so even though abraham did not understand the one that i love and i god gave it to me after 25 years going through after god had unchanged his body from an old man and made him young again took sarah from a 90 year old lady and let her come back to be young to have a child the miracle had it happened and you know after the miracles can you imagine you walking around with a stick 90 years old and abraham 99 you know walking around then all of a sudden ah oh thank you they looked at the mirror and they looked cool boy i'm back 1819 and then sarah looks so beautiful here she is back young and then all of a sudden she's for 25 years i've waited and i waited and i waited and god made me a promise that i'm gonna bless you but i didn't see it i never saw it i'm gonna tell you something you may get old and it look like it ain't gonna happen things are not gonna change for you things are not to happen for you you can give up amen but if god's you can't get out of god's plan and amen and actually get the blessing that god wants you to have sometimes the husband the wife the different things that we want in life the house that we want the car that we want to drive all of that you might say well i'm gonna get it on my own but you know god said i i'ma tell you something you can't bless yourself like god can bless you god can give you greater the bible says he's able to do exceeding and abundantly above all that which we can act as a thing are you with me he said eyes have not seen here have not heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things that god has prepared for them that love him are you a man i'm just i'm talking about what god can do for you possessing the gates of his enemy god can do far above just see we settle we settle with things we settle with uh trivial things we follow with the less than what god wants you to have we settle with it and we say well that yes yes i'm gonna settle with this amen this is what i you know this is what i want but god wants to give you greater greater than what but you see after the blessing after we get to a certain stage of our lives at certain stage of our christian walk we think thank you oh can you see i'm so happy [Music] okay i'm beyond trials intestines now i've already proven myself so i i've been through enough and now it's time you said that i can say oh i'm enjoying life now hallelujah god you finally came amen finally done what you say then it's time you sat back and relaxed whoo oh it was what me going leaving my father's house and separating all the trials and tests and everything i've been through oh let me sit back and see whoa i'm going to i'm in heaven now your heaven is interrupted oh you're enjoying playing with isaac and teaching him how to hunt fish and all that you know he's having a ball thank god this is what what oh it's worth waiting for amen because you're faithful abraham i'm gonna give you that child oh lord praise god aim at the house you wanted the job you wanted even the children amen god bless you and every everything about you see we come to a place that we are so blessed and so satisfied with what god has done and look like no it's over with no and see sometimes that's what happens to us and god says amen at no time amen do you tell god it is enough that i've been through enough i don't i'm not going through nothing else you know sometimes we do that with our relationships with companion i don't took enough off of him i don't took enough off of her and i ain't taking no more and sometimes you know we make up in our mind that we've taken enough and i ain't taking no more but sometimes is that what god says sometimes what we say what we're not going to take you know because god wants you to stay soft and hard and sweet let your heart still be soft and sweet praise god and say god will put no more on me you put no more on me than i'm evil are you with me god wouldn't allowed it if he wouldn't give me the strength to go through it are you with me so if god whatever you allow praise god let me face it with joy knowing that the trine of your faith amen he said count it all joy when you fall into what diver's temptation when you're going through your temptation when you're going through your trials kind of joy because i'm going to tell you that's going to be an end that's going to be into your pain into your troubles that's going to be a victory you may not see amen what you're going through in the struggles and the battles but that is going to be a victory a blessing in your testing are you with me god's going to amen hallelujah praise god you might not understand amen the purpose of amen of being obedient to your parents you might not understand that purpose right now but there is a victory on the other side amen and you understand and amen once you start reaping the benefits of your suffering praise god jesus knew that there was a victory amen and his suffering he knew that amen there was a blessing in his suffering praise god i see my blessing oh lord thank god that he looked beyond he met that cross and he looked beyond he meant praise god that death that he had to die and he saw amen he saw that one day amen you can take my life i live down but i got power to take it up again amen i see my resurrects hey i see my pain man oh i see my victory amen i see you amen praise god i i i see where god is making me stronger praise god i see why i'm getting stronger i'm not getting weaker but i'm getting stronger praise god hallelujah praise

level amen god whatever you bring my way god thank you jesus praise god because there's a blessing in my testing amen amen praise god i i i oh lord oh when i looked at what jesus went through and you can say lord was it worth it praise god was it worth amen what the word you coming on from your throne in glory and being spit on was it worth it for you to be called a devil a better bug prince of devils was it worth it for them to lie on you was it worth it for them to take the uh the whip and you shall pull your the flesh off your back was it worth it lord praise god and job was it worth it for you to hold on to god and maintain your integrity was it worth it praise god hallelujah was it worth it amen job didn't understand at that time but somehow he was going to hold to god's unchanging hand anyhow praise god i don't understand why i got to go through what i'm going through but nevertheless lord jesus said not my will but i will be done praise god i don't know god but god amen willing to go through what you want me to go to and sometimes don't let me don't don't deceive ourselves sometimes what we go through is because we put ourselves in that predicament sometimes we put ourselves there and god has allowed us to work this thing out because it's a lesson in the blessing are you with me god is teaching us a lesson in the blessing sometimes we have to learn even from our mistakes and god might they say hey hey there was a lesson that you had to gain through your testing so god was teaching you a lesson that amen don't you do that no more praise god you say well i i wish i had known better you knew better but you didn't want to know better are you up man so lord say that's a bless and sometimes god will let you amen praise god go through that little suffering and not look time i meant of regret amen i shouldn't have i knew better but i did it anyhow and now i'm being you think we need being punished and we sometimes well lord now i'm talking about suffering for christ's sake not suffering for your devilishness your meanness you're disobedient amen because you didn't do what you were your parents told you to do you didn't do amen what this teacher told you to do so when you flunked you flunked not because you couldn't do it because you wouldn't do it are you with me so we want a pity party oh i'm just so sorry that husband i got he left me that wife she won't do right these children they hard-headed you were hard-hitted you had a hard head and what what happened that was passed down through the genes it was in the seed you couldn't get it out amen because amen you caused your children to go through certain things because it was in the seed are you with me he said why they going through that you could call the blessing to your seed your children and your children after you or you can cause a what a curse to the third and fourth generation are you with me you see my behavior today can cause blessings on my children or can cause curses on my children how i conduct my life is maybe determine how what my children go through if i don't get rid of my complex it's gonna pass on down to the next generation the same kind of attitude that i had it's going to be in them are you hooked man i got to close possessing the gates of the enemy if you want to be blessed then you have to realize life is a big test abraham found out it was only a test god wasn't really gonna want him to offer up isaac to kill his son but god was testing him something think about it brother sister what is your test what are you present now we all through life journey how you're dealing with it what is god saying to you what is god saying you and i what did he say to us that our lives can be turned around and get on the straight narrow get on the right path

other voices outside influences but when you're down in the house and you say why did i listen to those voices why did i listen to jesus why didn't i listen to that right voice the one that was pointing me in the right direction to i can have a better life not to be successful tell you one day maybe soon that you'll find out the choices you made whatever man so that show you read let us
