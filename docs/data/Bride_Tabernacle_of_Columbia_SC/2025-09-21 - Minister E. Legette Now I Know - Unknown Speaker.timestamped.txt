[37:15] down. Hallelujah. Fill every heart. Oh

[37:22] Hallelujah.
[37:24] Let us pray this morning. If you have a
[37:26] special need, you can make it known by
[37:28] the lifting of your hands.

[37:36] we know how. Lord, we come to say thank
[37:39] you, Lord, for your grace, Lord, and for

[39:24] God is good, ain't he?
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Genesis 22 this morning. by the
[39:28] grace of God. Amen. God is good. Amen.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, let the Holy Ghost come on down.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Genesis 22,
[39:41] we'll begin at the
[39:44] at the uh let's begin at the first
[39:46] verse. If you got it, say amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "And it came to pass
[39:51] after these things that God did tempt
[39:54] Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham, and
[39:57] he said, Behold, here am I. Here I am."
[40:01] And he said, "Take thou now thy son,
[40:04] thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest,
[40:07] and get thee into the land of Mariah,
[40:10] and offer him, and offer him therefore a
[40:13] burnt offering upon one of the
[40:15] mountains, which I will tell thee." And
[40:17] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[40:20] saddled his ass and took two of his
[40:23] young men with him and Isaac his son and
[40:26] clay the wood for the burnt offering and
[40:28] rose up and went unto the place which
[40:31] God have told him. You may be seated.
[40:33] I'm going to read a little further down.
[40:35] Fourth verse says, "Then on the third
[40:37] day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[40:40] the place a far off. And Abraham said
[40:43] unto his young men, "Bide ye here with
[40:46] the ass, and I and the lad will go
[40:49] yonder, and worship, and come again unto
[40:51] you." And Abraham took the wood of the
[40:53] burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac
[40:56] his son. And he took the fire in his
[40:59] hand, and a knife. And they went both of
[41:02] them together. And Isaac spake unto
[41:06] Abraham his father, and said, "My
[41:09] father." And he said, "Here am I. I my
[41:12] son. And he said, "Behold the fire in
[41:14] the wood, but where is the lamb for the
[41:16] burnt offering?" And Abraham said, "My
[41:18] son, God will provide himself a burnt
[41:21] offering." So they went both they went
[41:24] both of them together. And they beca and
[41:26] they came to the place which is called
[41:28] wi-i which God had told him of. And
[41:32] Abraham built an altar there, and laid
[41:35] the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
[41:37] son, and laid him on the altar upon the
[41:41] wood. And Abraham stretched forth his
[41:43] hand, and took the knife to slay his
[41:46] son. And the angel of the Lord called
[41:48] unto him out of heaven, and said,
[41:51] Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here am
[41:54] I. And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon
[41:57] the lad, neither do thou anything unto
[41:59] him. For now I know that thou fearest
[42:03] God, seeing, thou has not withheld thy
[42:06] son, thine only son, from me." And
[42:09] Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked,
[42:11] and behold, behind him a ram caught in
[42:14] the thicket by thorns. And Abraham went
[42:17] and took the ram and offered him up for
[42:20] a burnt offering in thestead of his son.
[42:23] And Abraham called the name of that
[42:25] place Jehovah Gyra, as it is said to
[42:28] this day, in the mount of the Lord, it
[42:31] shall be seen. And the angel of the Lord
[42:34] called unto Abraham out of heaven the
[42:36] second time, and said, By myself have I
[42:39] sworn, said the Lord, for because thou
[42:42] has done this thing, and has not
[42:44] withheld thy son, thine only son, that
[42:46] in blessing I will bless thee. In
[42:49] multiplying, I will multiply thy seed as
[42:52] the stars of heaven, and as the sand
[42:54] which is upon the shore. And thy seed
[42:57] shall possess the gates of his enemy.
[43:00] And in thy seed shall all the nations of
[43:03] the earth be blessed because thou has
[43:05] obeyed my voice. May God add a bless to
[43:08] the reading of his word. That sounds
[43:10] good, don't it?
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. To be blessed like that, ain't
[43:13] it?
[43:14] &gt;&gt; But what got him the blessing was his
[43:17] obedience. How many believe that this
[43:19] morning? Come on. Sometimes, you know, I
[43:22] want to talk about I got it here from
[43:25] when God be to speak to Abraham and he
[43:28] says, "Now I know." Right? So, I want to
[43:30] I want to my topic this morning is now I
[43:33] know. We want to look at it from both
[43:35] angles. You know, God was here testing
[43:38] Abraham and he began to tell Abraham. He
[43:41] says after Abraham obeyed God, he said,
[43:44] "Now I know that you love me." Right?
[43:47] But before
[43:49] God could test Abraham for this final
[43:52] test somewhere I believe that Abraham
[43:55] had already had to come to a crossover
[43:57] point right to where he knew who God
[44:00] was. How many believe that this morning?
[44:02] So I said now I know. Do you know this
[44:05] morning? Come on. Have you cross came to
[44:07] that crossover point this morning?
[44:10] Because that's where the blessings is.
[44:11] How many believe that? Come on. So we
[44:13] find that I says you know uh here in the
[44:17] scriptures you know uh uh uh we see the
[44:20] the what happened here and how God you
[44:23] know a little background of it how you
[44:25] know Abraham had waited so long for the
[44:28] promise that God made him right but in
[44:32] the middle of waiting on the promise
[44:35] something happened right in the middle
[44:37] of waiting on on God to fulfill his
[44:39] promise to him he has some some trials
[44:42] and he has some other test that he had
[44:43] to go through. But what they were just
[44:46] the the other they were tests and
[44:48] sometimes
[44:49] we go through a lot of tests, a lot of
[44:51] trials and we think that you know uh
[44:54] well that might be enough but no God
[44:56] might got something else to put you to
[44:58] the final test. Amen. But nevertheless,
[45:01] all these all the other things, right,
[45:04] are just I believe strengthening your
[45:07] faith, right, to where you come to a
[45:10] place to where you can trust God in all
[45:14] things.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. The Bible says that Abraham
[45:18] staggered not at the promise of God, did
[45:20] he? Through unbelief, but was what?
[45:22] Strong in faith. How many believe that
[45:24] this morning?
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Giving glory to God. So it's somewhere
[45:27] along the line as as Abraham, you know,
[45:31] and who he was, but somewhere along the
[45:34] line before uh he got to this point,
[45:37] right? He had to have, you know, went
[45:40] through. Hallelujah. Right? But we know
[45:43] that he was the father of faith, right?
[45:46] Not only father of faith, but one of the
[45:48] key things he had was patience, right?
[45:50] Because you can have say, "I got faith."
[45:53] But you got to have patience sometime
[45:56] because God may not come right when you
[45:58] think he ought to come. Right. Right. It
[46:00] says, "But he always comes on time." But
[46:03] it's one thing about it. When you got
[46:04] patience with your faith, right? Is
[46:07] nothing can move you. How many believe
[46:08] that? Come on. You You'll be like a
[46:11] tree, I believe, planted by the rivers
[46:13] of water, right? Come on. That nothing
[46:16] won't be able to shake you. How many
[46:17] believe that this morning?
[46:18] &gt;&gt; And that's what it is. That's why we
[46:21] always a lot of times thank God for the
[46:24] struggles and the things that we've gone
[46:26] through because what that does that made
[46:29] you who you are today. You know, I was
[46:31] sharing with uh some of the guys the
[46:33] other night at work. I was just telling
[46:35] my testimony of where God brought me
[46:37] from. Right.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; And one of the guys uh supervisors, he
[46:41] stood up cuz he was a little bit
[46:43] stirred. He said, "Ernest, whatever you
[46:45] do, don't quit telling your testimony."
[46:48] He said, "Cuz somebody need to hear it."
[46:50] And I began to say to him, I says,
[46:51] "Yeah, that might have been a little
[46:53] while ago now." I says, "But even though
[46:56] it's been a little while, time ain't did
[46:58] nothing to the testimony.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; It's still fresh today."
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every time I think about the
[47:05] goodness of Jesus and where God brought
[47:08] me from, what shape that I was in, and
[47:11] how can I not uh uh be stirred to tell
[47:15] somebody, hallelujah, that if he done it
[47:17] for me, that he can do it for you.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; I began to share with them the other
[47:21] night. I said, "Sometimes you might look
[47:23] at, you know, where people are in life,
[47:27] right? You might look at the the the
[47:29] decisions that they can make sometimes
[47:32] when they when they're under fire,
[47:34] right? Or when they're under pressure,
[47:36] you can see them still standing firm and
[47:39] not have a worry about it, right? I
[47:42] says, but they didn't get there
[47:43] overnight, did they?
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. But it was something that built
[47:46] them up to that. Hallelujah.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; It was some storms and some other
[47:50] trials, some other things that built
[47:52] them up to get to that. So when they
[47:55] stand and they speaking to you, they
[47:57] acting not by what they heard or what
[47:59] they seen from others, but they they
[48:02] doing it by experience.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. I heard I seen but now I know.
[48:08] Hallelujah. That he's the same
[48:10] yesterday, today, and forever. Oh Jesus.
[48:13] Come on. God wants somebody to know this
[48:15] morning.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. But what happens many of times,
[48:19] come on. He puts us through the test and
[48:21] and we fall in the test, right? And like
[48:24] let's like Abraham Herod the whole test
[48:27] you know he waited a long time to get it
[48:29] didn't he come on
[48:31] &gt;&gt; all those years he did all the obedience
[48:34] to obey God and then when the blessing
[48:36] finally came right
[48:38] &gt;&gt; I can see him enjoying himself shouting
[48:41] praising God right
[48:43] &gt;&gt; but now all of a sudden one day God
[48:45] asked him you know that blessing I gave
[48:48] you I want you to give it back
[48:50] hallelujah come on God will try you with
[48:54] it, won't he?
[48:55] &gt;&gt; But it's one thing about him. Come on.
[48:58] He knew that God gave it to him.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And it was a miracle and him getting it
[49:02] from the beginning.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And if he worked a miracle then, he can
[49:06] work a miracle then. Right?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; That's the truth, ain't it?
[49:11] &gt;&gt; God is still working miracles, ain't it?
[49:14] &gt;&gt; I received him as one from the dead,
[49:16] right? God is able to raise him back up.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; But many of times, come on, people get
[49:24] what God promised them, right? And they
[49:27] forget all about God, don't they?
[49:30] &gt;&gt; They love it more than than the God that
[49:32] gave it to them.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Serve the creature more than the
[49:36] creator, right?
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. But I says, Lord, no matter how
[49:40] you bless me, how you lift me up, how
[49:43] much you do for me in my life, I don't
[49:45] ever want to forget who brought me. I
[49:48] don't ever want to forget who saved me.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to forget who visited
[49:53] me in those dark nights.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's real though, ain't it?
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. But I says that you know what
[50:02] it is. Abraham somewhere along the line,
[50:05] like I said, he got to that crossover
[50:07] point. How many believe that?
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. I was hearing a a a girl say
[50:12] she made a statement about about uh you
[50:15] know she didn't really uh have religion
[50:18] wasn't a religious person didn't really
[50:19] believe in God right but she says many
[50:23] people they they believe in God because
[50:25] they had some some trial or some crisis
[50:28] come and that caused them to look to God
[50:31] and and then that's he he he worked it
[50:34] out for them and then they started
[50:35] serving them and that may be true Right?
[50:39] Because if you belong to God, God going
[50:41] to do whatever he got to do to get you.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. But she made a statement. She
[50:47] said, "I hadn't had that happen in my
[50:49] life yet. But if something like that
[50:51] happens in my life, then maybe I'll I'll
[50:54] turn to him then. But I I began to say
[50:56] within myself when I was thinking about
[50:59] that, it don't work like that."
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; While while you are here today, the day
[51:06] you hear his voice,
[51:07] &gt;&gt; right? Harden not your heart.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; How many believe that this morning?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. As they did in the day of
[51:13] provocation because when that crisis
[51:16] come,
[51:17] &gt;&gt; you might not have a chance. Hallelujah.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; When that dark night come, come on. And
[51:22] that's the truth, ain't it?
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I say, give God all you
[51:27] got. Amen. You know, I I was praying the
[51:29] other week and you know, I was thinking
[51:31] about that song. One of the sisters,
[51:33] Sister Irene, used to sing, you better
[51:36] give God all you got.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; And I began to just moan and and sing
[51:41] that a little bit in my prayer. You got
[51:44] to give God all you got. God want people
[51:46] that's going to give them all they got.
[51:48] Right?
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Remember, he owns every cattle on the
[51:51] hill. One thing about it, why I can give
[51:54] God everything? Because I know that he
[51:57] he's great. He He's got every own
[51:59] everything, right?
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. He's able to do exceeding
[52:04] abundantly above what?
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can ask a thing. How many
[52:09] believe that this morning?
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing you reaching for,
[52:13] don't you know that's at the disposal of
[52:15] God?
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's the truth this morning,
[52:18] ain't it? Hallelujah. But we find that
[52:22] like I say, uh Abraham, come on. He had
[52:25] somewhere along the line. How many agree
[52:27] with that this morning?
[52:28] &gt;&gt; That he got to a crossover point, didn't
[52:30] he? Come on. Even though I I says many
[52:33] of times, you know, uh we find that that
[52:37] people come on. They they they haven't
[52:40] got to that point yet. Right? So God
[52:44] shows you and I that, don't we? Don't
[52:46] he? Many people in their heart, they
[52:49] say, "I'll follow God. I'll go with him
[52:50] all the way." Come on. But when those
[52:53] dark nights come, which they coming, how
[52:56] many believe that? But when they come,
[52:59] where is your faith? Hallelujah.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; I believe that Peter said, "Lord, if all
[53:05] forsake you, I won't." Hallelujah.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. And Peter made that statement.
[53:12] I believe after it was already revealed
[53:14] to him that Jesus was the Christ.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; When nobody else could see it.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Peter saw it, didn't he?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus told him a flesh and blood hadn't
[53:27] revealed this to you, right?
[53:29] &gt;&gt; But it's my father that's in heaven. You
[53:31] couldn't see it on your own, but God had
[53:34] to open your eyes.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Many times you want to see it. You want,
[53:38] but God's got to open your eyes.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe that this
[53:43] morning?
[53:44] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that God opened my eyes.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that God brought me out.
[53:50] Come on. If it had not been for Jesus,
[53:53] where would I be? Come on. How many
[53:56] believe that this morning?
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Come on. But he thought he
[54:01] thought that, didn't he? But then he
[54:03] began to He said, "I'll never I'll
[54:05] never." But when that dark night came,
[54:07] come on. In the midnight hour, what did
[54:10] he do? Come on. He He swore. He cursed.
[54:14] He denied that he even knew Jesus. Come
[54:18] on. Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Out of all the things that God uh worked
[54:22] among you, right?
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[54:26] When the when the ship was tossed and
[54:28] about to sink one or not, come on. Wind
[54:31] blowing hard. Here come Jesus walking
[54:34] out on the water.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; That's the man that you denied that you
[54:37] even knew. Hallelujah.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; But in your dark night, come on.
[54:44] When you was crying out for fear, you
[54:46] didn't deny him then, did you? You said,
[54:49] "Lord, if it's you, I know the wind and
[54:52] the storm, everything looking drastic.
[54:55] But if it's you in this storm, bid me
[54:59] come." Hallelujah.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; And Jesus bid him, didn't he? He got out
[55:03] the boat and began walking, right?
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; But we know the story of what happened
[55:08] when he began to look around. He got his
[55:10] eyes off of him, right? But remember
[55:13] that's the man that he denied, right?
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, so many testimonies he had, right?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; So many miracles that God had already
[55:23] worked, right?
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. In his heart, he wanted to
[55:27] stay, didn't he?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; He wanted to fight. He wanted to be
[55:31] there with him to the end. But Jesus
[55:34] knew it was going to take more.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Than what he had, right?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was going to take a Pentecost
[55:40] experience.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; It was going to take the Holy Ghost.
[55:43] Hallelujah.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. Like they say, I can't live
[55:48] right till you send it on down. How many
[55:50] believe that this morning?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. What I say is that what that's
[55:54] what it took. Come on. Before he come to
[55:56] that crossover point, right?
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; But either way, no matter what it takes,
[56:01] you got to come to that, don't you?
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. Trials, test, you got to come
[56:06] to that. But when he came to that place,
[56:08] right, he can be able to stand up. Maybe
[56:11] somebody could identify him that it
[56:13] wasn't long ago. You told us you didn't
[56:15] know him. Now you out here preaching in
[56:17] his name. Come on.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Few days ago, you say you didn't want
[56:22] nothing to do with him, but now you out
[56:25] here telling everybody how he died for
[56:27] their sins.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. Why? Because something new had
[56:31] happened in his life, right?
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. I got faith to stand
[56:37] now, right?
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't have faith then, but I got it
[56:40] now.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; I thought I knew then, but I know now.
[56:43] Hallelujah.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I knew now. Right.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; I thought I did, but now I know.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's living inside of me.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; And what's inside of me won't let me
[56:57] deny.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Won't let me not stop praising them.
[57:01] Won't let me not tell somebody about the
[57:03] goodness of Jesus. Hallelujah. I can't
[57:07] help but to testify.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. Is it burning in your heart
[57:12] like that?
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. I don't know about you, but
[57:15] it's burning in my heart that way.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. But what it is, come on. God
[57:20] loves us so much, don't he? I says, "And
[57:23] what it is, you know, uh uh you know,
[57:26] all these tests and trials, like we
[57:28] said, he says, now I know. I believe
[57:31] that like we said Abraham, you built up
[57:33] to that point and just as you and I
[57:36] building, right? Come on. God is God is
[57:40] taking us somewhere, ain't he? But what
[57:42] you got to do, as I was sharing with the
[57:44] church last Sunday, I says, sometimes
[57:47] you got to remind yourself of those dark
[57:50] nights.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. Sometimes you got to remind
[57:55] yourself, come on, of past trials. And
[57:59] don't dwell on the pain now. Come on.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; We ain't talking about dwelling on the
[58:03] pain. We talking about reminding
[58:06] yourself of those times and the victory
[58:10] that God wrought in your life.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Reminding yourself
[58:14] &gt;&gt; of that night you stayed up all night.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Didn't know what the outcome was going
[58:19] to be.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; But God, hallelujah.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; When you woke up, oh Jesus,
[58:25] &gt;&gt; his mercies were new. every day.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to remind yourself.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; I'm in my present storm, but I'm going
[58:38] to remind myself.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. Like the sister was singing,
[58:42] you got to encourage yourself. Nobody
[58:44] else ain't going to encourage you
[58:46] sometime.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They might discourage you,
[58:49] but you got to encourage what? Yourself.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; You got to stir yourself up in God
[58:55] sometime. Lord, I know what everybody's
[58:58] saying. I know what everybody else is
[59:00] doing. But God, I'm reminded what you
[59:02] did for me.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; I'm reminded what you promised me. I'm
[59:07] reminded how you brought me.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't by no ideology or trickery.
[59:12] But God, you came in my life and you
[59:14] shook me up one day.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; I'm reminded.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; And I don't believe you brought me this
[59:20] far to leave me.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. How many believe that this
[59:24] morning? But you got to stir herself up,
[59:27] right?
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Remind yourself. Don't revisit it
[59:30] because of the pain now,
[59:31] &gt;&gt; but revisit it because of how you
[59:34] shouldn't have made it out, but God gave
[59:36] you victory over it.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. You thought about little David.
[59:40] Hallelujah.
[59:42] And how he had to reminding
[59:46] himself like the guy was telling me the
[59:47] other night, don't quit telling your
[59:49] testimony, I can't, right? I can't. Come
[59:52] on. because it was the power of God in
[59:54] that
[59:55] &gt;&gt; and he's still doing stuff right now,
[59:58] ain't he? But I believe that like I say,
[1:00:01] you got to remind yourself. I believe
[1:00:03] David was reminding himself, wasn't he?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; When Goliath stood out that that there
[1:00:08] that day, right? When nobody else could
[1:00:11] reach back. Hallelujah. But David had
[1:00:14] some dark nights he could reach back to.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He had come to a crossover
[1:00:20] point, hadn't he? When Saul hadn't,
[1:00:23] hallelujah, when all the great warriors
[1:00:25] hadn't, but this young boy had come to a
[1:00:28] crossover point, he didn't look at
[1:00:30] Goliath for who he was, but he looked at
[1:00:32] him, hallelujah, as a promise that God
[1:00:35] made that thy seed shall possess the
[1:00:38] gates of his enemy.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. I ain't looking at
[1:00:43] how tall he is, how much he can fight.
[1:00:45] Come on. It don't matter. He ain't
[1:00:48] nothing but a devil. Come on. And God is
[1:00:51] still casting out devils.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; He's still defeating devils.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. But he's stir himself up,
[1:00:59] right? He got there in front of Saul and
[1:01:02] those didn't look like much. But what he
[1:01:05] was doing, he was testifying, wasn't he?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; He says, "Uh, come on. Don't you know
[1:01:12] who we serve?" Hallelujah.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Don't you know? Well, let me tell you if
[1:01:17] you don't know because now I know.
[1:01:19] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. I was back there
[1:01:24] sheep one day.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. And a lion came. See, he was
[1:01:27] revisiting those dark nights,
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; wasn't he? Oh, Jesus. Grabbed him. Would
[1:01:34] have killed the little lamb, right? But
[1:01:37] something rose up. Come on. Maybe he
[1:01:40] said, "I thought without acting." Come
[1:01:42] on. Oh, Jesus. But before you know it,
[1:01:45] he had killed that lion, didn't he? Oh,
[1:01:48] Jesus. a barricade and same thing. Come
[1:01:51] on. And I'm convinced that if God
[1:01:53] brought me through that, hallelujah,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; then he'll bring me through this.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced if he's God on them in the
[1:02:02] wilderness,
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; if he's God on the back side of the
[1:02:05] mountain,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; he's God right here, right now.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, somebody ought to get stirred
[1:02:11] this morning. Oh, how many believe that
[1:02:13] God is still the same yesterday, today,
[1:02:16] and forever? He did it once, he'll do it
[1:02:19] again.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe it.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. But he revisited those nights,
[1:02:24] didn't he?
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; I can see him walking. I was stirred. I
[1:02:30] said, I can see him walking. Come on. Up
[1:02:31] the up to Goliath. The Bible said he
[1:02:33] stopped by the brook and grabbed five
[1:02:35] smooth stones, didn't he? Come on. But I
[1:02:38] can see him walking just quoting to
[1:02:40] himself, "The Lord is my shepherd. I
[1:02:42] shall not want." Hallelujah. It worked
[1:02:45] in the wilderness, in the back of that
[1:02:46] mountain. It'll work now. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:02:49] Jesus. The Lord is my shepherd.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on. Is he the strength of
[1:02:56] your life this morning?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Then whom shall you be afraid of?
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Remind yourself. God, you are
[1:03:03] my strength then. I need you to be my
[1:03:06] strength now.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. I ain't trusting in my own
[1:03:09] ability, in my own self. God, I needed
[1:03:12] you then. I still need you now.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. Even now I need you.
[1:03:17] How many do believe that this morning?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. But he had walked right
[1:03:22] revisiting those dark nights. Like I
[1:03:24] said, David was testifying but not
[1:03:26] revisiting but because of any pain but
[1:03:29] revisiting the victories.
[1:03:31] Come on. Oh Jesus. The odds were against
[1:03:35] me but the victory that God brought. And
[1:03:38] I'm convinced now. God, you don't have
[1:03:41] to do nothing else. You already done
[1:03:43] enough. I'm convinced right now.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Because of the victories that
[1:03:49] you brought in my life. I'm convinced
[1:03:51] right now because of how you heal my
[1:03:54] body. I'm convinced right now.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Because of how you picked me up out of
[1:04:00] the muck and the miracle.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Now I know.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Do you feel that way this morning? Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; But it's a crossover, ain't it? Like I
[1:04:14] says, you don't you sometimes people
[1:04:16] look, but you don't get that way
[1:04:17] overnight, do you? Come on. But it's
[1:04:20] some things that that that God I believe
[1:04:22] he brings us through, right?
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. But I says that, you know, in
[1:04:28] those those hours, like I says, the test
[1:04:30] is coming, ain't it? Come on. And
[1:04:33] sometimes it looks like one test after
[1:04:35] another, don't it? One trial after
[1:04:38] another. Come on. But your eyes got to
[1:04:41] be single.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. To know that it started with
[1:04:46] God, it's going to end with him. Come
[1:04:48] on.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. He won't let your foot slip.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that. Come on.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; But what God does, like we says in
[1:04:57] Abraham, it was just a test. Now, God
[1:05:00] already knew what Abraham was going to
[1:05:01] do.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. By him being God, right? But he
[1:05:05] wanted to show not only him but the
[1:05:07] whole world, right?
[1:05:10] To the extent that if if you obey my
[1:05:12] voice, right? Come on. That if you trust
[1:05:16] me, come on. Like I said, the man that
[1:05:19] that trusted God, he said in blessing,
[1:05:21] I'll bless you. Sometimes you want a
[1:05:24] blessing. You try to bless yourself.
[1:05:26] That ain't a blessing that come from
[1:05:27] God.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that this
[1:05:30] morning?
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; God know how to open doors and make
[1:05:33] ways. the where it wasn't even supposed
[1:05:36] to happen that way.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; But when God got in it,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. When the master took over.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; You say, "How'd that happen?" Because
[1:05:47] God took over.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus stepped in.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that he stepped in.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Because if he hadn't, I don't know where
[1:05:56] I'd be at.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Somebody give the Lord praise
[1:06:00] this morning. Come on. God is good,
[1:06:02] ain't he? Come on. I says that what it
[1:06:05] is. Let's look at Hebrews 3 by the grace
[1:06:08] of God. Y'all feel all right this
[1:06:10] morning? Come on. I said the crossover.
[1:06:12] Amen. Hebrews 3. Let's look at Hebrews
[1:06:15] 11. Hebrew Hebrews 11. By the grace of
[1:06:17] God. Come on. You got to have that
[1:06:20] crossover point.
[1:06:23] I don't know about you, but I I I've
[1:06:25] come there this morning.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:06:28] that no matter what comes my way,
[1:06:32] let it say my life is in his hands.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that this
[1:06:37] morning?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Hebrews 11 and
[1:06:44] we'll begin at the
[1:06:46] the 19th verse.
[1:06:55] having trouble with this Bible in the
[1:06:57] pages. Hebrews 11:19. Y'all feel all
[1:07:00] right this morning?
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And it reads, "And God accounting that
[1:07:04] God was able to raise him up." Talking
[1:07:06] about Abraham now in his trials. God was
[1:07:10] able to raise him up from the even from
[1:07:12] the dead from whence also he received
[1:07:15] him in a figure. By faith Isaac blessed
[1:07:18] Jacob and Esau concerning these things
[1:07:20] to come. By faith, Jacob when he he was
[1:07:24] dying blessed both his both his sons and
[1:07:27] worship. I I think I need Hebrews 3.
[1:07:29] Hebrews 3.
[1:07:31] Hebrews 3.
[1:07:36] So we so we see then let's go up to the
[1:07:38] 16th verse. Hebrews 3:16
[1:07:42] says, "For some when they had heard did
[1:07:45] provoke, how be it not all that came out
[1:07:47] of Egypt by Moses
[1:07:50] by but with him who was he grieved 40
[1:07:53] years? Was it not with them that had
[1:07:55] sinned, whose carcass fell in the
[1:07:58] wilderness,
[1:08:00] and to whom swear he that they should
[1:08:03] not enter into his rest, but to them
[1:08:05] that believe not."
[1:08:08] So then, so we see that they could not
[1:08:11] enter in because of unbelief. Come on. I
[1:08:15] says what it is. Like I said, we talking
[1:08:17] about now I know in the crossover,
[1:08:20] right? Come on. Somewhere along the
[1:08:22] line, you know, it says God taking you
[1:08:24] through all that. But you must you've
[1:08:26] got to come as to some point to a
[1:08:27] crossover point. Right.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Now, what we're seeing here is a people
[1:08:32] that no matter what all God did for
[1:08:35] them, come on, they still never came to
[1:08:37] that crossover point.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. A people that when they were in
[1:08:42] bondage for all these years, right? Come
[1:08:46] on. You know, people don't appreciate
[1:08:48] sometime what God do for them.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; They say, "God, we know you did this,
[1:08:54] but we need you to do something else."
[1:08:56] Come on. I want to ask you this morning,
[1:08:58] what more does he have to do?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. He done come and died, didn't
[1:09:03] he?
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; He done laid the foundation. He done
[1:09:06] opened up the way for your heal and he
[1:09:09] was whipped.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. He went through a lot. What
[1:09:13] more do we got to take him through?
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. But sometimes people don't
[1:09:18] people don't appreciate what God is
[1:09:19] doing for them.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Say, God, you did this. I know, but
[1:09:22] Lord, I I know, but I need you to do
[1:09:24] something else. But God is faithful
[1:09:27] sometimes
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; because he loves you, right?
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; And he wants to draw you
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; into the nest.
[1:09:36] What did I say?
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Sometimes. Y'all catch me. Come on.
[1:09:44] God is good. Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; I hear everybody laughing at me. Come
[1:09:48] on. But God is good, ain't he?
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. I said he want to bring you in
[1:09:54] the nest, don't he?
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; But what it is, he wants you. That's why
[1:10:00] he say keep doing things because he
[1:10:02] loves you. You know, God goes to so many
[1:10:04] extent such extents sometime to get his
[1:10:07] people to love him.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. You think about even after he
[1:10:11] died and he rose and he began to show
[1:10:14] himself to people, he even told the
[1:10:16] disciples before that happened that this
[1:10:18] would happen, right? And everything came
[1:10:20] just like what he said. But even after
[1:10:23] that, they still didn't believe, right?
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that they believed not.
[1:10:28] But all of a sudden, he come walking
[1:10:30] through the door. Hallelujah.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; That looked like that should have been
[1:10:34] enough. Right?
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; But yet, you still have some that didn't
[1:10:37] believe. He said, "Give me bread. Give
[1:10:39] me fish."
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; I want to show you. I want you to
[1:10:43] believe me. I want you to trust me.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; That when I tell you something,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; come on. That it'll be just like I said.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Have I failed you yet?
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. God hadn't failed. How has he?
[1:11:00] Come on. Have I never not come through?
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm trying to get you to
[1:11:04] believe me. What else you want me to do?
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe Thomas said, "I I
[1:11:09] still won't believe unless I I touch the
[1:11:11] hand and in your side." Right?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Come on then." Right? I
[1:11:16] want you to believe me.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to see that I do what I
[1:11:21] said.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. I want you to trust me. Oh
[1:11:25] Jesus.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said I trust God this
[1:11:29] morning.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; I said, Lord, you don't have to do
[1:11:31] nothing else. Hallelujah. Bringing me
[1:11:33] out of the muck into my clay was
[1:11:36] impossible sometimes. It looked like by
[1:11:38] itself.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Hallelujah. You know, one
[1:11:42] thing I I was I was stirred about the
[1:11:44] other day. I was reading how David was
[1:11:46] saying he was saying I'd rather be a
[1:11:48] doorkeeper in the house of God than to
[1:11:50] dwell in the tents of the wicked. Come
[1:11:52] on. And I began to think about that. It
[1:11:55] it's it's greater in the house of God.
[1:11:58] Hallelujah. And in his presence
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; any day, ain't it?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. I I It's better I'll be a
[1:12:05] doorkeeper.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. And I'll be content with that.
[1:12:09] God, I just want to be where you are.
[1:12:11] Hallelujah.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. I just want to be in your
[1:12:15] presence, under your covering. Is that
[1:12:18] what you want this morning?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. But we find that like I says,
[1:12:23] sometimes no matter what God does,
[1:12:25] that's how people reaction is. But but
[1:12:27] he did what he said, didn't he? Come on.
[1:12:30] He did it. He told him after 400 years,
[1:12:34] right? I'm coming, right? And he came
[1:12:37] just like he said, didn't he? And when
[1:12:40] he came, it seemed to be unbelievable,
[1:12:43] right? Seen to be impossible.
[1:12:46] But God works in the impossible.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because all things are possible
[1:12:51] with him.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; But he begin to work in what looked like
[1:12:54] it was nothing. Right?
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And he begin to use that what looked
[1:12:58] like it wasn't nothing.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; But all of that was for the people to
[1:13:02] give God glory after it was over with.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. that they'll be able to look
[1:13:08] at that trial and know the only way I
[1:13:12] made it through it was because what God
[1:13:14] did.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; That's why God done it that way.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Right. I believe it was Gideon Gideon or
[1:13:22] those he told it when he was going to
[1:13:24] fight. He said, "You got too many. I
[1:13:25] don't want nobody else to get no glory."
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. Paraphrasing it, right? Come
[1:13:30] on. But all he does that for, he works
[1:13:33] in the impossible. He works with the the
[1:13:36] small. He works in the things. Come on.
[1:13:39] I share with people all the time. I says
[1:13:41] when it looks like all the doors are
[1:13:43] shut, when it looks like there's no way
[1:13:45] possible, that's just when God begins to
[1:13:47] work.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what you got to do, you
[1:13:52] got to turn your faith loose.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Because all of your other resources are
[1:13:56] exhausted.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. All your friends are gone.
[1:14:00] Everybody that will encourage you ain't
[1:14:02] there no more. That's where God begins
[1:14:05] to work right in that place. How many
[1:14:07] believe that this morning?
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. But he brought he he came, like
[1:14:10] I said, he did that. He worked miracles
[1:14:13] and signs and wonders right in Egypt.
[1:14:17] Brought them out. But one of the things,
[1:14:20] like I said, the whole time they were
[1:14:22] brought out, they had a problem with
[1:14:24] crossing over, right? Come on. whole
[1:14:28] time they were brought out from the very
[1:14:30] beginning at the Red Sea. What they say,
[1:14:34] "We told you you should have left us in
[1:14:35] Egypt. You brought us out here to die."
[1:14:38] Come on. But God heard him say that,
[1:14:41] didn't he? But God begin to show I like
[1:14:45] how God spoke through Moses. And Moses
[1:14:48] says, he says, "Fear ye not." Right?
[1:14:52] Come on. But stand still and see the
[1:14:54] salvation of the Lord.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. But this day, he said, "God
[1:14:58] going to fight for you."
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And the Egyptians, come on.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; That hurt you, that gave you pain all
[1:15:05] those years.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. The ones that had you bound
[1:15:09] after the day. Hallelujah. You won't
[1:15:11] have to worry about him no more.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. The Lord going to fight for
[1:15:15] you.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. After the day now. Come on.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; That should have been a crossover.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:26] God. He said, "I'll fight for you." Come
[1:15:28] on. Oh, Jesus. But still yet, that was a
[1:15:31] crossover for them, was it? Come on.
[1:15:34] Right. Look like on the red after the
[1:15:37] Red Sea and they dancing with the
[1:15:39] tambourines.
[1:15:41] Come on. The women singing.
[1:15:44] Come on. Look like then they would have
[1:15:47] said, "Now I know, right?" They didn't
[1:15:49] know, did they? Come on. They danced in,
[1:15:54] but another storm was coming, right?
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. They danced in, but another
[1:16:00] test was right around the corner, wasn't
[1:16:02] it?
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. And test after test, come on.
[1:16:07] God proved himself to be worthy.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Test after test, God proved himself to
[1:16:14] be still alive and well.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. Trial after trial, God showed
[1:16:20] up, didn't he?
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. But yet they still
[1:16:23] couldn't muster within themselves to
[1:16:26] come to a crossover point.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on. Good day. I said,
[1:16:31] "What else they got to do?" Come on.
[1:16:34] They get all the way to the land and
[1:16:36] what they go over and even to the
[1:16:39] description of what God told Moses the
[1:16:43] land would be back like, right?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; They went over in the land and they came
[1:16:47] back with the evidence of the
[1:16:49] description.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. They came back with the
[1:16:53] fruits of it, right? And they themselves
[1:16:56] testify that it's just like what God
[1:16:58] said it to be.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's just as good as God said
[1:17:02] it was, right?
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. But their eyes messed them up.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Didn't it? Because by then they hadn't
[1:17:13] learned faith yet. Come on.
[1:17:16] By then they had learned to stop looking
[1:17:20] at what your eyes see.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; They had learned then
[1:17:25] to stop hearing what your ears hear.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because if it's going against
[1:17:31] what God word say,
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; let every man be a lie, let God word be
[1:17:35] true.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. That's the truth.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; But it comes to that crossover, right?
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; They never got there. who when they got
[1:17:46] there, they says, "Oh, we can't go in.
[1:17:48] They're giants. We grasshoppers in our
[1:17:51] in our in our own sight." Come on. But
[1:17:54] God here, he says, "Since they murmur,
[1:17:56] they complain." Come on. Oh, Jesus.
[1:18:01] They wanted, I provided for them. They
[1:18:04] were sick, I healed them.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; When the enemy came, I fought for them.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. I did all that I could do, and
[1:18:12] yet they still don't believe me. Yes.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yet they still won't trust me
[1:18:20] like their forefathers did. Hallelujah.
[1:18:23] Come on. But it was two out of the
[1:18:25] bunch. Right.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. But the Bible says that they
[1:18:28] had another spirit, didn't they?
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. They weren't the same as
[1:18:33] everybody else in church.
[1:18:35] They were a little bit different.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah. They had Hallelujah. Come
[1:18:40] on. I said, "What it is?" Everybody
[1:18:44] ain't the same.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. When the dark night come, it'll
[1:18:49] show you that.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Come on. When trials and tribulations
[1:18:53] come, it'll show you that.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. I was praying. I said, "Lord,
[1:18:58] but when all my strength is gone, let me
[1:19:01] find my strength in you."
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What it is, we look for the
[1:19:06] Holy Ghost to rise up.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. We look for the guide to take
[1:19:09] over.
[1:19:10] Come on. Because without him, you ain't
[1:19:12] going to find your way.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; But in those times, that's when the
[1:19:16] guide take over. That's when he begins
[1:19:18] to order your footsteps. You don't know
[1:19:20] the direction you're going in. But you
[1:19:22] just keep walking. Hallelujah. You just
[1:19:25] keep pressing because now I know.
[1:19:28] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; But we find that like we said, two of
[1:19:32] them had a different spirit, didn't
[1:19:33] they? Come on. But what do they say? It
[1:19:36] says we are more than able.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. How' they How' they come to
[1:19:40] that conclusion?
[1:19:42] Come on.
[1:19:44] Somewhere somewhere they came to a
[1:19:47] crossover point. Do you believe that?
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Somewhere. Come on. They came to that
[1:19:52] place. He already done enough. Come on.
[1:19:57] I know what is in the land. But what's
[1:20:00] in the land can't defeat the promise
[1:20:02] that God made us.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The promise that God made us is
[1:20:07] greater than all the trials that's
[1:20:08] standing before us.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; What God did is greater than anything
[1:20:14] that could come upon us.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; So I know not only are we able, but
[1:20:19] we're more than able.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; We're more than conquerors through
[1:20:24] Christ that loves us and gives us what?
[1:20:26] Strength. How many believe that this
[1:20:28] morning? Somebody give God praise this
[1:20:30] morning?
[1:20:31] Come on.
[1:20:34] I say it's what it is. You know, you you
[1:20:37] find that like I said that you come to
[1:20:39] that you come to that place. You got to
[1:20:41] come to that place.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. That crossover
[1:20:45] life will change then. Come on.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Things will change because then you'll
[1:20:52] know. Come on. Like we said, now I know.
[1:20:55] Then you'll know, right?
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; That the God you serve, right? It's no
[1:21:00] test or trial that come on your life
[1:21:02] that he didn't already know about. They
[1:21:05] hit you hard sometime come and they
[1:21:07] might come like go knock you out because
[1:21:08] you wasn't really aware of it. But when
[1:21:10] you get down on your knees and you begin
[1:21:13] talking to the one that brought you and
[1:21:15] you said, "Lord, I knew you knew this
[1:21:17] day before it even came
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; and I didn't see it coming. Neither did
[1:21:20] you tell me. But Lord, what I'mma do
[1:21:22] right now, I'mma wait on you."
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because I know what you told
[1:21:26] me. Hallelujah. I wrestled long enough
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; and I know that you'll make a way for me
[1:21:32] somehow.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; And while I'm down here on my knees,
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; come on. All those that are around me,
[1:21:38] give them faith to believe God.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. And if they can't muster faith
[1:21:42] to believe, when you get done, let them
[1:21:46] see that you're the same yesterday,
[1:21:47] today, and forever.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; If you can use anything, Lord, use me.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; It's trial. If if it's for somebody
[1:21:55] else, help me to bear it.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. Don't you know
[1:22:00] sometimes God's sending you through so
[1:22:02] he might show the world through you that
[1:22:04] he's the same yesterday, today, today,
[1:22:05] and forever.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. That he can show the world
[1:22:08] through you, that if you trust me, if
[1:22:11] you live for me, if you believe in me,
[1:22:14] hallelujah, then I'll do for you what I
[1:22:16] did for them.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, you got to believe that this
[1:22:19] morning. Somebody believe that this
[1:22:21] morning.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] Oh Jesus. God is good, ain't he?
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the one thing I I was
[1:22:29] close with this one thing I says, you
[1:22:32] know, come to that crossover.
[1:22:35] It's something about, you know, I've
[1:22:37] been doing a lot of witnessing and stuff
[1:22:39] lately. And I was, like I sharing with
[1:22:41] one guy, I says, you need a gospel
[1:22:43] that's going to change you. Come on. You
[1:22:47] It can't just be intellectual knowledge.
[1:22:49] That's why you can't live right, you
[1:22:52] know? That's why you having these
[1:22:53] struggles. Come on. But you need
[1:22:55] something that's going to change you.
[1:22:57] Come on. I begin to say how often used
[1:23:00] to pray when the Lord saved me. I begin
[1:23:02] I often pray, Lord, I need you to do
[1:23:05] something. I need a double dip. I need
[1:23:08] to be filled up to the top. Let my cup
[1:23:10] run over because I said, "Lord, I'm
[1:23:12] afraid of myself. I don't know what I'm
[1:23:14] capable of. So God, I need you to come
[1:23:17] in. And I know when you come in and you
[1:23:19] sit on the throne of my heart, it'll be
[1:23:20] over with then. all of my struggles, all
[1:23:23] the temptations, the battle, all that
[1:23:24] will be over with then. So, I had to
[1:23:26] stay down on my knees long enough. Come
[1:23:29] on. But sometimes people don't never go
[1:23:31] there, right? They just satisfied with
[1:23:34] coming out. Come on. But that's what it
[1:23:36] says. Just like the children of Israel,
[1:23:37] they never came to that crossover point.
[1:23:40] But when you come to that crossover,
[1:23:42] hallelujah, that's where he wants you to
[1:23:44] get at, right? Then, uh, things will
[1:23:46] change. Like I say, you need a gospel
[1:23:48] that'll change you, right? One of my one
[1:23:50] of my friends, he he Muslim by faith,
[1:23:52] and he was saying, "You Christians," he
[1:23:55] was saying, "All y'all Christians." He
[1:23:57] said, "Y'all y'all only uh uh read or
[1:24:01] live by whatever y'all, you know, what's
[1:24:04] um applicable, not applicable, but
[1:24:06] whatever you want to pick and choose out
[1:24:08] of, you know." I said, "No real
[1:24:10] Christian to do that."
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; I said, he said, "All I" I said, "No
[1:24:14] real Christian." I said, "But a real
[1:24:16] Christian, he ain't going to live by
[1:24:18] bread alone, but by every word."
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; A real Christian in his heart, his
[1:24:23] desire is going to be to be pleasing to
[1:24:25] God in in all his ways.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And all that he got, what he wanted to
[1:24:30] do is is give it back to God, a real
[1:24:32] Christian, right?
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; But I began to share him with that. I
[1:24:35] says, "That's not that's not so." But
[1:24:38] you know, some things was talking about
[1:24:40] and it was another guy with us and we
[1:24:44] was talking. And I says, you know, one
[1:24:45] thing about it, I says that a lot of
[1:24:48] people, they they they profess God with
[1:24:51] their mouths, but their heart ain't in
[1:24:52] it. Come on. I said, well, well, did
[1:24:56] Isaiah prophesy of you, saying they
[1:24:58] honor me with their mouths, but yet
[1:25:00] their heart is far from me. There's a
[1:25:02] lot of people like that, ain't it? But
[1:25:04] what it is, you got somebody that's like
