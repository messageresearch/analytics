Um I want to appreciate uh Pastor Henry Simmons to give me this opportunity to come and uh speak before you. Amen. We appreciate the Lord for how we're being kept. We're being kept so nicely. Uh and we are enjoying our stay. We're also discussing with my wife. You're such a good people with such a good spirit people as who love the Lord. We are really enjoying the fellowship. Amen. Praise God. Uh like the pastor said, my name is uh brother Jimmy Kasha. Uh you may be seated for a while from uh Zambia. Uh most of you have heard about Zimbabwe but Zambia is the neighbor to Zimbabwe. So I come from Zambia and uh in the capital city Lusaka and uh church name is Bethlehem Tabernacle. Amen. Um just a little background about me. We came to the message when I was nine. Uh that was 1986 and uh my wife their family I think came two years later. So, we were Sunday schools together. Uh, and we grew up in the message. I could see her at Sunday school. I didn't know she would be my wife. Yeah. But I I knew this sister was just so committed. And um later by God's grace, we got married. We have uh three children, two girls and one boy. Amen. So, we appreciate the Lord. She's always stood by me like I was testifying the other places it was uh difficult to get a visa for her to join me. I've been to US three times now. First time was uh the last last year and the other year about the same period of April. So this third time I said I would love to go with my wife but it was difficult to get a visa because the time we applied for the visa um they were pushing interviews to 2026. So I prayed I said Lord if you've allowed me to go with my wife uh let the dates move. Amen. So we were planning to start out um early April or late March. So they moved the dates to April 2nd. I changed her appointment to that. But I said, "Lord, I needed to move a little further into February because we need enough time to buy the tickets cuz when it gets too close, they become expensive." So we I prayed over it. By the end of January, the Lord made a way. They opened them in February like the just a few days after end of uh January. So I appreciate the Lord. And when we went there, the interview just took about 2 minutes. Um I I I had a plan because I knew they would uh maybe give a hard time and you know your accent sometimes uh for us in Zambia it's difficult to hear. You got you got to do a lot of padon padon. So I didn't want her to have a hard time. So I told them um I need to interpret for her. So I I I was part of her interview and because I've been here already, it was easy for her to get the interview to get get the visa. So just a few questions, we were told your visa is approved. Amen. Praise God. And here she is ministering. Amen. She's a singer. She was avoiding to sing. I think brother Jeremiah we had to plead for her to sing. But you know uh pastor for for him he didn't ask me. He he just called her even in Malin's he just called her to sing and and that was good because for for for me we went negotiating we brought Jeremiah there to say can you please sing? Can you please sing? So, and and when I was about to call her, she was giving me eyes like don't don't don't. But the pastor in Merlin's just called her and and today he's just called her. So, that's good. That's good. Praise God. Amen. So, we we came by brother David and Sister Hannah in Florida. Yeah. Brother Charlie in introduced me to that family and just the first time we met, hey, it was love at first sight. They were so good people as well. So they uh uh gave us a lot of testimonies and we had a lot of experiences just right in their house. I could see God come down. One of the uh girls received the Holy Ghost right in their house when I was there. They came to visit and uh we started testimonies and testimonies and the Holy Ghost came down right in the house. Amen. And one of the sisters just got baptized of the Holy Ghost in the house. I was like, "Wow, these people, they're so much uh soaked in into the presence of God." And I I I really deemed it a privilege to know them and to interact with them. And uh one of the times when I was there, I think it's last year, then uh uh Daddy Simmons came over. So we met in that house there and and Caleb there. Yes. So that's when I knew him and uh from the time they opened their church, I I've been following a few of their services and I know I saw uh Daddy Simmons was preaching there. So I I followed uh the one life the the sermon that was uh the one life amen that you got to leave. So I enjoyed that. And uh in my interactions with uh uh sister Hana, I really discovered that she's so gifted. And uh one day when I was back home in Zambia, I wanted to call her. But then I thought I'll call her later or something. And then we had a program with her brother uh who has a prophetic gift to go and pray for a sister who had uh serious demons. He prayed for her in the church. But uh he said the battle is not yet done. We need to go to the house. So I went to pick him to take him to the house. I didn't tell him uh we I'll pick you this time. I just called him, "Oh, brother, now I'm coming to pick you up." And and he couldn't tell me. He wasn't ready spiritually. He hadn't prayed enough. He hadn't prepared. And being a prophet, obviously, he saw how big the battle is. So, he needed to be at a certain level in the spirit, but he didn't prepare. So, he then he failed to tell me he didn't prepare. So, I picked him up. And as we were driving towards that house, I told him, "Oh, I had a missed call. there's a certain sister in US but I'll call her later. Then he says something told him tell Jimmy to call that sister. So he told me can can you call that sister in US? I said oh okay let me call. And when I called the phone was on speaker. So the moment she says hello he he said wow this sister is anointed and he went in tonesues. So started speaking in tonesues. Then I had to apologize to sister Hannah. Sorry. Uh uh there's some noise here because somebody's speaking in tongues and and uh he says, "Oh, okay." She says, "Can can I greet him?" I says, "You can't. He's under anointing right now." And uh the brother was went on went on and when we reached uh where we were going, he now calmed down and they chatted with sister Hannah. And right there on the phone, he told her, "Hey, sister, I can see right in your car where you're driving, there's an angel seated with you." Wow. And I said, "Oh, that's beautiful." And then from then on, they they're more friends than I am friends with, sister. They communicate almost every week. And then uh when we went to the deliverance, it was done. It was a walk over. The demons surrendered and they went. And afterwards he told me, he said, "When you picked me up, I wasn't ready to handle those demons. But when I spoke on that phone call with that sister, I tapped anointing from her and my anointing was full enough to go and handle those demons." Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. So you can really get impartation and anointing just by association. Amen. That's why we come together in the house of God. Amen. And we come to influence one another. You bring your fire. I bring my fire. You bring your fire. It becomes one big fire. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. So the services that we came and uh uh attended there for them. I was preaching for them. Preached four services. The the the the anointing was going higher and higher per service. It was so beautiful until the last two services. Hey, hey, hey. We were just on top. God came down so much prophecies were happening. Tongues interpretation and one of the prophecy was about a brother who was supposed to preach and and God spoke to him to say it's your time. God has called you to preach. And the brother testified he had been praying for 2 weeks asking God, "What am I supposed to do in the kingdom of God? What am I supposed to do?" And right there in that service, God spoke and uh and do will you imagine? I was watching their services uh today. That brother was already given to preach I think yesterday and he preached first time like he's been a longtime preacher. It was so nice. I was I was calling her. I was like, "Wow, how I wish I was at that service. How I wish I was at that service." Praise God. But then after that, we went to uh uh Marian for brother uh Jeremiah there. We had a good time. Amen. My my my I couldn't even finish my little sermon. It was little but we I just cut it to littleler because the anointing was already moving and it was nice. And then strangely it's it's the pastor when he was introducing he says Lord may he see the supernatural. I was like, "Really?" Because you pray, "May the supernatural, may the preacher bring the supernatural." But he said, "May the preacher see the supernatural." And and when when when when I came there just before the them picking picking us up, I had a a little dream like very short dream like somebody's telling me, "I need to heal your eyes." And one of my eyes got dim in the dream. and and he he was looking this way and then he turned to look at me and by looking at me he was healing my eye and then he says as you open your eye will be clearer and and when I was opening my eyes I was waking up and then I checked it was time to prepare to go. So I wondered what is this? And when I reached there I spoke about it in the prayer. I said Lord that dream I had if there's anyone who has an eye problem you heal them. And then when the pastor was closing he asked did you say something about the eye? The eye is because I've had eye problem. I've been doing droplets uh in my eyes and I believe that's for me. And and sister the wife says oh even me and she didn't tell the brother. She says, "I had a problem with the right eye." So, Brother Jerma asked me, "Which eye was it?" I said, "It was the right eye." Wow. And I saw the supernatural among you people. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Yesterday, we went to Malins. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. It was fire upon fire and then we heard tongues and a prediction from Nathan. Praise God. You're such a good people. And I can feel the atmosphere here is already burning. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. May God bless you people. Bless the pastor and bless everyone, the instruments there. God bless every believer. We worship you, Lord. We thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. My my my. Sure. Praise God. Shall we stand as we go to the word? We're going to read Joel chapter 2 verse 25. Hallelujah. Praise God. Yes. Joel 22:5 or Joel 2:2. Yeah. The Bible says, "And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten." Amen. The conqueror and the caterpillar and the palmer, my great army. and I will uh that I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied. Amen. And uh and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed. And you shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and that I'm in I'm the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we've read the scripture. We pray that Lord, may you lead us through this service in Jesus' name. Lord, make these scriptures alive. Oh God, let the restoration be enforced, Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You may be seated. I usually like to sing a song. I I almost skipped it, but let me sing it. Amen. Create in me a clean heart, oh God. M and renew a right spirit within me. M create me a clean heart. Oh God. Yeah. Rein me. Oh, cast me away from thy presence. Oh Lord, take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of my [Music] salvation. My spirit within me create me God.

Oh, I renew my spirit with me. Hallelujah. Let's give him praise. Hallelujah. Jesus, you're worthy. You're worthy of worship. Oh God. Praise God. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. My little title this uh evening is enforcing a claim to be restored. Amen. Amen. Enforcing a claim to be restored. Amen. Praise God. Amen. From the scripture where we've read, the Lord is saying, I will restore. Amen. Praise God. Amen. I will restore all the years. that will stop the years that the locust, the caterpillar, the canoem, the palm has eaten. Hallelujah. And uh uh he goes on to say that and you shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel. Hallelujah. Praise God. Jesus. What is to restore? Restoration is to return to the former uh owner or to bring back to the former a state of condition. Amen. And we can enforce a restoration. We can enforce a claim of restoration. Praise God. And God in his own uh nature uh he's already always had has a nature to restore. Amen. Beginning just in the beginning when man fell when man seen the fellowship between God and man was disturbed. Praise God. Amen. And right there God went into action to restore the fellowship. Hallelujah. He went into action. He came down. He killed the lamb and provided the sacrifice so that the restor the the fellowship is restored. And throughout the ages, God is a restorer. God restores whatever goes wrong, he makes it right. Hallelujah. Praise God. I'm losing the volume. Praise God. Hallelujah. Uh God is a restorer. My my my whatever uh gets destroyed, he restores. Amen. It is in his nature. That's how God is. Hallelujah. He puts up something and if it gets disturbed, he comes back and restores. Praise God. Amen. throughout the ages, even when Israel, whenever they could fall out with God, maybe they seen and they're chased out of the land, God will do something to start bringing them back into restoration, he'll send a a a preacher, maybe a prophet to bring them back to God. Praise God. Amen. Even in the days of Elijah, when the people had gone away from God, God brings a restoration. Amen. They restored the altar. Praise God. Amen. He's a God of restoration. And we are here tonight to talk about it. Uh even in the natural, God has showed it. Even in nature, there is restoration. You cut down a tree, come there after some three uh weeks, you find it's raising again. Uh there's some resurrection happening. Praise God. Amen. Even when winter comes uh it's death. When uh uh the cold kills the things uh by its coldness uh somehow the sun comes back again summer uh spring comes back again and the sun restores whatever was killed. Praise God. Even in the spiritual it is the same. Amen. When the devil comes in praise God. Amen. When the devil comes and brings death uh through the denominational spirit uh and and he brings death praise God. Amen. God does a restoration. Praise God. Amen. He's there all the time to restore whatever the devil is destroying. Praise God. Amen. God is a restorer. Amen. And we are here tonight to enforce the restoration. We are here tonight uh to enforce the restoration. Hallelujah. The spirit of God is there to restore whatever the enemy destroys. Praise God. Amen. We see there was these four insects that came and destroyed and ate up the blessings of Israel and God says, "I will restore." Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. I don't care what the devil has done in your life. Amen. God is here tonight to say, "I will restore." That's why we are here in the house of God. We have the authority. We have the right uh to bring a restoration to bring enforcement of a restoration. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. The devil, that's John 10:10, comes to kill, to steal, and to destroy. Amen. I I was I was just thinking maybe uh uh it's looking three stages there where we read it was four stages but I I believe the fourth stage is the mixture of the three stages. The devil comes in these four stages three stages and a mixture of them. The devil comes to kill to steal and to destroy and he sent these four stages upon the the church. Amen. But God comes to restore. We find even in the early church when the church at Pentecost it has it was full of power. It was full of the reality. It was full of the supernatural. And the devil doesn't like it that way. When he sees the churches on fire when he saw they were on fire, the devil came in the form of a denominational spirit and came riding on the four horse riders. Hallelujah. the white horse, black horse, red host, and pale host over the ages to try to kill what Jesus began. Praise God. Amen. But God says, "I will restore." Hallelujah. And we see him down through the ages. He started the restoration. He started pulling the church back to the Holy Ghost. And by 1906 at Susa Revival, the Holy Ghost fell again. Hallelujah. God is a restorer. He's here to restore tonight. Uh we are here to enforce a restoration. We are here to enforce a restoration. Hallelujah. Anytime God moves, the devil also moves to destroy. But praise God, we don't care about the devil's destroying power because we know the God we save is a restoring God. Hallelujah. He's able to restore whatever the enemy destroys. Praise God. Amen. And when the message came, the church was on fire. The things were happening. The supernatural was moving. Praise God. Amen. But the devil wants to follow after the message church to try to kill the fire, to try to kill the the move of God by using quotations uh by using uh uh certain teachings uh trying to push out the Holy Ghost from the church. Praise God. Amen. But we appreciate the Lord. He when the devil comes in like a flood, he raises a standard. Praise God. Amen. And God has been raising standards. Uh men like brother Seans standing up for the gospel, standing up for the power, standing up for the church to be in the Holy Ghost. Uh that's the restoration power. The man is getting older, but we don't care. We know God is raising young men like us to come on the scene to keep preaching restoration, to keep enforcing the restoration. Whatever the devil destroys, we are here to push it back. Whatever the devil destroys using false teachings, we are here to preach the correct teachings so that we restore. We are here tonight to enforce a restoration. We are here tonight to enforce a restoration. Whatever the devil has destroyed, we are here to enforce. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. God is able to restore. But there's got to be a willingness on our part. There's something you and I have got to do about it. Because if we don't do anything about it, it's not going to happen. Somebody's got to rise up and enforce. We have the right to a lot of things. We have the right to the healing. We have a right to the power of God. We have a right to the gifts. We have a right to all that. Even Joshua, he was told. Hallelujah. Every place you shall step, I give it to you. But it wasn't easy. There were there were enemies there. There were demons. There were giants there. Praise God. Amen. He had to fight his way because it is his right. Praise God. Amen. Even even us, the devil wants to push away the things that are our privileges. One time uh uh uh uh uh one preacher said uh the the the church is living below their privileges, but you and I tonight we can come and enforce a restoration. Praise God. Amen. Because the devil is a squatter. Just like those who were staying in the promised land who Joshua came to drive out, the devil is a squatter. If you don't drive him out, he will take advantage of you. He'll take advantage of your children. He will take advantage of your your health. He will take advantage of your gift. Hallelujah. Until some of you, maybe you were seeing visions, but over the years he has eaten it away. Maybe some of you were prophesying, maybe you were speaking in tongues, maybe you were testifying, and the devil has been eating that away. But praise God, we are back tonight in the house of God. We are here to enforce a claim. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Restore us, oh God. Restore the church, oh God. Restore the believer, oh God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. We are here to enforce. The devil is a squatter. We got to send him sermons. And the Holy Ghost will enforce it. The Holy Ghost is a policeman who will come to this devil that is sitting on your property. He will come and say, "You devil, you got to get out." Hallelujah. I don't care what sickness that can be upon you. It is sitting on your health. And the devil is saying, "I'll sit here. I'm not going to go away." But devil, you are a squatter. You are just a squatter. We You don't have the legal right to stay upon the believers. You don't have a legal right to hold the gift of a believer. You don't have a legal right in the name of Jesus. As a servant of God, I command you, get out. Hallelujah. The devil's got to go. He's got to go. He has no place. He's been holding you, but he's in illegal. Amen. He's a squatter. We are here tonight to serve him sermons by the Holy Ghost. Satan, your time is up. You got to get out. Hallelujah. Maybe he's holding your children. They can't come to church. I'm here to tell you, we have the authority by the word of God to tell the devil, "Let go of my children. Let go of the children. Let go of the children in the name of Jesus. Satan, get out. You are a squatter. You got to go. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. There are some altars that are speaking against you. Altars of witches. They're saying she's not going to get married. She's not going to be prosperous in her business. But we are here tonight to serve them sermons in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh, such altars. Holy Ghost fire, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. The devil got to get out. We are here to enforce a restoration. God promised us it's our privilege and we are not going to be below our privilege. We are going to be above. We are going to enjoy our healing. We are going to enjoy our joy. We are going to enjoy our peace. We are going to enjoy the fire. Come on. Receive the fire. Receive the fire. Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive the power. Oh, I feel the power moving. I feel the power moving. I feel the power moving in the building. Oh, Jesus is passing by. Jesus is passing by. You can touch him like the woman with a blood issue. You can touch him and say, "Lord, hallelujah, pass me an [Applause] autog. May God restore your gift. May God restore your gift. Those eyes that stopped seeing visions, tonight we open them. Receive your visions. Receive your visions. those mouths that used to speak in tongues and the devil has eaten it away in the name of Jesus Christ as a servant of the living God. I open those mouths. I open those tongues. I open those prophecies. I open those miracles. Maybe you used to pray for the sick and they get healed but somehow the devil at it away. The Lord says, "I will restore." Praise God. Amen. Maybe you were on fire for God and God and the devil came and ate the fire away. We are back in the house of God. We are here to say fire, fire, fire, fire follow me. As on the day of Pentecost, fire fall on me. Hallelujah. Praise the man. Hallelujah. The message came to restore us to the faith of our fathers. And where are those who are restored? Here we are. Here we are. We are the restored believers to the fathers, the Pentecostals. Oh, God almighty. They were so anointed until the shadow of Peter could heal the sick. They were so anointed. Oh, until they could take clothes from Paul and lay it on the sick and the sick were healed. Oh, that's where we are being restored. That's where we are going. If we are not there yet, we are here to enforce. Hallelujah. We are here to enforce a restoration. Receive the power. Receive the fire. Receive the anointing. The super anointing. Receive it in the name of Jesus. He is already here. I already feel his presence. You can be restored. You say, "Preacher, I used to pray more hours, but now I've stopped." Don't you worry. There's power in the room right now to ignite that, to revive that. Receive your revival. Receive your revival. Receive the fire. Hallelujah. Praise. Hallelujah. Oh, be be restored, my brother. Let the fire burn more and more in your ministry. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. God is a restorer. He's saying, "I will restore." I don't care what the devil has done.
