may we bring your greeting from mueller's in jesus christ's name amen praise god it must turn to the book of genesis amen genesis the 7th chapter amen we're going to talk about the righteousness of god this morning genesis the seventh chapter and we're going to read the first verse amen praise god anybody got it amen and the lord said unto noah come thou in all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation let us pray lord god we are read your holy word and the actual blessings upon her for your glory in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated amen thee have i seen righteous in this generation it is a powerful statement for god to say at all that generation and days of noah when there were millions uh i don't want to say billions i don't know how many but it was millions of people on earth in that day god said to one man thee have i seen righteous i i seen only you righteous in this generation i know i lived in a wicked generation y'all know what the bible says by noah's time it was a wicked time an evil time men were doing all kinds of things let's read a little bit about that we understand what noah was facing what was going on on noah day but noah had a different testimony he was living so close to god that god said thee have i seen righteous before me now we're righteous mean that there's no sin he's sinless and that's a blessing for god to declare you righteous for you to be sinless i know you want to be sinless you can't see the law without sin the bible said the word to the sin is death so noah was sinless there by seeing righteous you look at the word righteous that means you to be declared sinless i don't see no sin in you noah and there's the evil age and the evil generation you live in you the only one that i have seen that is walking close walking with god or doing the will of god doing what god wants done see we need to do what we need to do what god wants done remember we weren't done we won't talk about that so we got to do what god wants done that's the only way god's going to see us righteous we want to be found righteous how many and only the righteous going to be saved only the righteous going to be delivered so you got to be sure by the grace of god that you will be found righteous in the sight of god i want to be found righteous not my righteousness i want his righteousness see we got our own righteousness sometimes we think we right this is the uh the age we live within is the call that they have they ought to see and we know let's see it mean people's right so everybody got a right to think they're right they're doing wrong but they think they're right see they'll be living everybody doing whatever they want to do and they think is right but we know according to the word of god is wrong see everybody got a right so we're living in an age when people think they're righteous regardless of their doing the will of god or not they think they're right and just as far from god's word as they can be see they think they're right because they're doing what they want to do just to be living in their odyssey of people's rather everybody doing what they want to do regardless of what the word of god said and it was the kind of day that noah was living in noble living in the dead where everybody did whatever they wanted to do see regardless of what god's word said it did whatever they wanted to do so god had a man in his hand that he was able to use and know the bible saying noah walk with god see noah walk with god not not god walk with noah now nor walk with god see if we we if god try to walk without we probably take god please you don't want to go see uh we go places that we shouldn't go but see noah walk with god that's very important right there it wasn't god walking with noah noah walked with god and that what god us to god want us to walk with him because how you walk with him by walking in his word we got to walk with god in this eye we can't walk what we want to walk that would have happened to the world and that know was that everybody was doing what they want to do but god had one man that was willing to walk with god walk with his word see stick with the word of god amen so no what day of evil time amen noah david was living in by the grace of god in the fathers of six and one the bible said the king the power of men began and multiplied upon the face of the earth and the dog were born to them that god saw the sons of god saw the daughters of men they were fair and they took them wise of all which they chose so amen they went out there doesn't live in any kind of way that we see people doing today man and giving him marriage just doing everything he can do and god said my spirit and always strive with man for he is flesh also yet as they should be in 120 years ago a number of men's days and see the giants in the earth uh back in that day how they did and all they did is took them women they did whatever they want to do that people are doing today they're doing whatever they want to do no regard for god's word how can it be god declare you righteous when you won't even walk in his word you're not gonna be declared righteous you're not walking god's word and hey that's why noah condemned the world the bible said we're gonna read that he condemned the world because noah was the only one that was walking with god according to what the bible say amen so god saw the wickedness of man the fifth verse that it was great in the earth and every imagination or thoughts that was hard was only evil continually and repented the lord he had made man and he grieved him at his heart so we see what's going on we see what kind of aid noah was living in nobody living in a real bad time but one thing noah did noah walk with god no walk with god god had to come and reveal himself to noah god had been talking to noah in order for noah to walk with god god to come and reveal himself to noah and noah took god's word and nor began to walk with god amen that we need to do in this generation we need to make sure we're walking with god not walking with your friend so much that's all right not walking with your neighbor that's all right but make sure you're walking with god walk with god amen that's how you're gonna get out of here the bibles we got another man to walk with god the bible says enoch walk with god that's right he walked with god and after a while they couldn't find a why because god took him that's right he went up in a rapture he was translated come on somebody he walked with god that we need to do walk with god you want to get out of here walk with god you want to get in the rapture walk with god you want to be kind of righteous walk with god walk with him how are you going to walk when the brother gives them by taking heed to his word amen living according to the word of god what's been revealed in this hour god always reveals his word see noah had a revelation god came to know and tell noah it's going to rain contrary to everything in that day he got a revelation from god that it was going to rain it never happened before and noah began to preach what god told him amen he preached for 120 years but nobody that what it was condemned see faith come by hearing him by what the word of god so noah preached the word of god to those people he preached the bible said 120 years no preach that same message was going to rain but these people didn't believe noah so they perished don't you know god doing the same thing today preaching to people that he's coming the lord is going to come get yourself ready the rapture is going to take place preaching the same thing that something's going to happen but people go on the same or whether they didn't know this they know the bible to eat they drank their mad wife and giving the mountain to the same day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and what destroyed them all nobody was saved but noah and those that got into the ark with him amen let's read the man to go to the book of peter ii peter so we see the day noah lived in it was a bad time or evil time don't you literally living in the same kind of time you saw the evil you got got to have somebody righteous got to be somebody living the word of god somebody believe in what god said somebody holding on to the word because god never left himself without a witness somebody is living right somebody is walking with the lord somebody is holding on to the word of god god got somebody yes okay how evil it is out there how he was in the school how evil it is in the churches however wherever you go however that god got somebody amen praise god god always gonna have a witness and that he will aid only had one noah oh lord the only one god could have find in that day declared him righteous save his soul and his house amen thank god he's chilling listen to him sometimes your children don't want to listen to you now is the time to listen chilling amen amen thank god the family listened to them and they got inside the ark god inside dog food was too late when a destruction been coming they got inside the ark people need to get inside the ark doctor there's christ you need to get in christ amen hallelujah so get in see his family a man listen to him his children uh his wife they listen to him all the people in that world in that time they refuse to hear noah why scientific education thank god for your other kids know they'll be over the word of god don't let me be educated and be with the word of god thank god you needed to live in this world to do things but don't let your education be over the word of god if god says something you take god's word over what they're teaching inside the schoolhouse amen all stuff they teach in the car change to the will of god oh lord we get a see what noah does see how they were teaching the noah day saw the people going on a noah day saying all the things they were doing was right they were writing their own eyes doing what they want to do here god got a word he got a standard amen he got a servant noah there no preaching the word of truth or righteous the first day and nobody wants to believe noah same thing going on today god preaching the word send the lord to soon to come get ready oh my come to church get filled with the holy ghost oh my people keep on going on the same way they're going jesus was there but one day one day it was too late noah got inside the hog amen and god shut the door and once god shut the door the bible said no man can open you better get a knock before the door closed god is going to shut the door and no man can open come on somebody get inside the ark before the door closed god's going to shut the door and nobody else can get in get sealed into christ get sealed in don't get sealed i'll get sealed in the old people know what they were sealed out they couldn't get in no matter how hard they knocked on the door they tried to try but remember noah priest told him to come inside the ark they didn't preach almighty they were banging on the door they were hauling and crying but it was too late they should have heard the word of god he said listen to that righteous man hallelujah they said listen to that righteous man you better listen to these holy people god got before you y'all be by listening to these holy people listen somebody hear the word of the lord amen amen that people are refused to hear noah's preaching but when the door closed to the ark and the rain started falling i guess it was something never it was so surprised by the water dropping out the sky that they had to stand up and look up and just look for a while because it never happened before so they had they were a little stunned when the first drops of water came but as it got heavier it got more strong you know i haven't seen that strong rain you got to stop your car way on the side of the road there's only one place they can go out for safety that was to the ark so they ran in hard as they could bang it all on the door oh they were trying to get in but noah couldn't do nothing anyway god shattered noah couldn't open it amen the preacher from peace the word to you he can't let you in god got to let you in hey man so the you better get in now while he got ahead today david hear my voice hiding out your heart that's right so they they they couldn't get in same way it's gonna be today oh lord have mercy let's go to peter ii peter hallelujah ii peter the second chapter amen praise god look at the fourth verse and if god spared enough the angels that sin would cast them down to hell and deliver them into chains of darkness to be preserved unto judgment and spare not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness no noah was a preacher of what righteousness so what is righteousness it's god's word wasn't that what noah was preaching he was preaching to them what god revealed to him that it was going to rain y'all come on inside doctor noah was a preacher of righteousness he believed what god told him and because he believed it he preached it he acted on what he heard amen begin to warn everybody around him it's going to rain god will pull down he's going to destroy this world come on into the ark and god said noah was a preacher of righteousness why because he believed the word amen he believed what god told them what god looked for somebody to do somebody believed the word i say it's true god didn't send a prophet this is going to be a rapture we are in the last days come on somebody you see what's going on around you everything is being fulfilled the time of that hand it may come on into the hockey man oh my noah amen a preacher of righteousness he believed what god said and began to preach it to those people the preacher they made 120 years but they didn't believe noah they made fun you know people make fun of you when they're trying to do what god words say you make fun of you or whatever it is you got long hair to make fun of that you got a long dress on it make fun of that if you go to church like you post it and make fun of that everything you do for god people want to make fun of it they got something to say about it somebody gonna criticize they're gonna know they see them building on the ark oh no y'all what's going on today know you still building that old boat ain't no rain coming noah don't you know they do the same thing today they'll criticize you because you're trying to live right they'll criticize you you're trying to do the will of god they will criticize you young people get criticized see they'll criticize you but don't do that criticism stop you amen you keep on coming you keep on doing no one never stop building it man he kept right on building it man he didn't let the criticism stop you can't let nothing stop you you have to press on through it all press your way through no had to press through all that unbelief all that stuff was going this day it meant he had to press through and he built up amen he built it you know let none of that stuff stop him noah a preacher of righteousness he preached the word of god god revealed to him that it was going to rain it meant something impossible for that day but nevertheless god said it and it was going to happen amen and noah became a righteous man because he believed what god's word said man let's go to hebrews 11. praise god we're talking about noah right now we've got some other people to talk to you about by the grace of god but noah a preacher righteousness preach the word of god for his day what god revealed to him did you know god had done the same thing but god has revealed something to us we got to preach the word for this day that's right we got to preach what god has given for our day this this is what god declared righteous you preached the word revealed for your dead again god will declare you righteous it's by faith amen and faith inside god's words a god will declare you righteous because you believe the word for your generation not another generation this is the last generation we look at we saw this wickedness going on there's another generation after this y'all know that right jesus said all these things shall come to pass upon this generation this is the last generation there's another generation after this this is the last generation there amen that would have that way the devil trying to destroy the young people as hard as he could he don't want y'all to have nothing you try to take everything away from you all you can the only thing you really got is church is the lord and he's trying to steal that from don't let him steal it from you the devil trying to steal it away from him he can think of not important so you know why we got to go all the time my oh my the devil trying to steal it from the young people he's trying to steal from some old people too the devil's trying to destroy everything that's of god don't want you to think god even real but i said this morning god is real i said he's alive amen because you're the same thing he did in old time he's here amen manifesting his word amen god is alive he's not dead we serve a living god amen that can do everything he promised he can do argue to have a little bit of faith be let's go to the book of amen our hebrews i think it's a little bit of faith praise god not much faith just a little bit of faith usually that faith is a grain of mustard it's a little bit of faith it means you hold on to it don't let nothing stop you from believing it hallelujah don't let nothing stop you from believing what god's word said you confess it in your sleep confess it when you wake up confess it when you walk on the street confess it inside your car confess it everywhere why because you're a believer and god will bring it to pass see when you ain't respecting it it comes to pass then that's how you know it's the lord god bringing it to prayer you didn't even miss me just confessing to what the words say and all of a sudden you just believe it and all of a sudden what you ask god for manifest it lord have mercy amen god manifested amen notice hebrews 11 and 7 by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet see it wasn't material yet never happened move of fear preparing an off to the saving of his house by to what she condemned the world why were they condemned jesus jesus this is the condemnation the light is coming to the world men love darkness rather than like or the deity what's the condemnation unbelief you condem because you don't believe therefore a high condemnation nor condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith so we become righteous by faith in jesus christ you believe the word that god send to you for your day not somebody else's day then god declares you righteous he declares you sinless in his sight now if god declares you sinners in his sight now he ain't gonna let you just keep on running around doing evil your life gonna have to change some kind of way noah was not there doing nothing wicked no trying to the bible he walked with god that's right so no i didn't do anything wicked god declared him righteous he was sinless but noah didn't go around trying to do no sin see if god's gonna declare you righteous then you're gonna stop sinning somewhere down the line you're gonna start doing what's right you're not gonna keep on doing the same old thing you've been doing something gonna happen in your life go out and go just say oh i'm gonna make you righteous you believe the word are you still doing the same thing you've been doing no that's not what god talking about god talked about something has happened in your life because the change doesn't come you believe the word did you know that bible say faith and when if you got true faith then something might happen a change will come the bible says fear with our works is what dead so if you believe god like the bible say then you'll do something nor believe god and you did what he build dark that's right that's sure you have faith to believe what god's saying god honored his faith and declared him righteous see so noah he condemned the world because of the unbelief didn't want to believe what noah was saying because it never happened in nowhere day amen praise god okay let's look at another script let's read look at the book of proverbs amen proverb the 30th chapter now notice that you've got to remember now this generation we live in is the evil generation jesus calling in an adulterous and sinful generation that's right jesus is an adulterous and sinful generation and we see a lot of that going on see this generation we live in is a real bad generation amen just know what days was and the book of proverbs lets us know uh what kind of generation this is we're living in young people you're living in a real bad generation it's real bad out there for children because you being taught to disrespect parents you're being taught a man different things they man they're making it bad everywhere in the schoolhouse and everywhere so they're being taught to do things that we wasn't taught to do when we grew up that's right we grew up oh hallelujah we can't do too michael we know we're getting we getting knocked you're getting knocked when you ain't even looking for it you can get knocked something flying from across the room you won't even know we're flying we're going to hit you see we grew up in a different time we couldn't do that but now in this generation right here the young people are being taught to be what disrespectful you said to be taught yes look at the little program you there to watch on the tv or the monitor you saw disrespectful the little programs is look at just spend a little time and look at one of those little programs and see how disrespectful they are on those little programs i tell a little girl she can't watch that stuff no no that thing is disrespectful and that was going on see they're teaching the children this generation had to be disrespectful that's why you get a lot of talk back they already get a lot of lip from children because to be taught that see but we know we couldn't do that those of us a little bit of age or not we could not do that we know better than that hey man we go we're going up we might walk way out the house but guess what they catch you before you get out the door the shoe fly behind you out the door you heard what you're saying in your head you say something even your eyes move wrong chilling today i can get all crossed up on you we don't do nothing sometimes why it's degeneration this is the last generation that's why it's so bad out there that's what god's trying to get people come on into the arcade man come on into the heart before you look at uh proverbs uh amen uh uh 30. now this generation isn't right amen praise god proverbs 30 and 11. this is this generation there's a generation that curses their father and don't not bless their mother lord have mercy india out there doing it come on somebody the children they're not appreciative don't even bless their mother sometimes you know labor and did everything for me then they woke up in the morning say good morning we had to say good morning we had to say yes ma'am and no ma'am we had to did y'all hear what i just said we had to we didn't do we know what was going to happen this generation right here they can do it and nobody says nothing why why you think that is it's the atmosphere it's the age it's the time we live in and that's why it's going on like it is and god the only way to get it right people got there to come and they cried you gotta hear the word you gotta believe the word of god amen so they don't bless and they curse their father don't bless their mother the bibles are generating as pure in their what on eyes and that we see it going on today everybody doing what they want to do and they think they're right they come to church when they want them they dress how they want her they do everything they want to do and still come before god so they are they they appear in their own eyes ain't nothing around me i need no help i'm coming to church though said the lord still do what i want to do okay that's the generation we're living in though there's generating a pure known eye yeah they're not washed from their filthiness ain't come coming ain't been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they ain't really repented ain't nothing changing about them so that way they keep on doing what they're doing see when you've been washed in the blood something happened that's right you've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and even baptized him and he wouldn't wash the bible get washed they may wash your sins away calling on the name of the lord see wash your filthiness away watch that stuff from about people ain't gonna wash it there's a generation over how lofty are the eyes the eyelids are lifted up lord have mercy the little house people got the lord gave it to you thank god for it whatever you got the little car you got god gave it to you thank the lord for it but this generation lord have mercy they get a name-brand car you can't tell them a thing they think they've arrived they think they are the lofty come on somebody y'all hear what i'm saying this morning they're lofty because of what they got don't realize who gave it to you the lord gave it to you without the lord you want to have nothing whether you say it unsaved everything you got god gave it to you god allowed you to have it so don't need to be high and lofty you need to humble yourself brother senator kim preach that man humble yourself no matter what you got humble yourself amen so this generating high and lofty eyelids lift it up think you got everything they ought to see a well we've got to have need of nothing increased with goods see yesterday we live in there it's the generation right there the generation whose teeth are not swords and their jaw teeth the niger the body pull off the earth and the needle among men help who you better get a job help who i ain't helping nobody they better get out there and what see that's that bad attitude help whoever you can the lord lead you amen don't don't look down remember some of them worship and we see our contemporary the people that we grew up with out there on the street and this and bad but guess what was the mercy of god that got you out of that but with mercy you'd be in the same ship i see it every day i thank god every day i was coming went to a place the other day a man asked me for some money i'd be out there sitting down and i don't i don't carry cash on me so i gave him what i had in my pocket so i don't carry cash i gave him what i had in my pocket i gave him something anyway my first intention was not to give him nothing then the spirit of god checked me and i said well i don't carry cash so he goes to god bless y'all just give him that whatever though i had but um lofty high high-minded i've been in that i would have been sitting down in that corner that i still wanted for the mercy of god i i would have been out there in that shape but wanted for the mercy of god you'd have been out in the same shape running for the mercy of god so you have to thank god every day and if you can help somebody help them in jesus christ's name amen god's gonna bless you for it if god put on your heart to do it amen a lot of schemers out there and you can't discern them but god can discern them and let god lead you to jesus christ's name but don't be the high and generated to be living and high-minded and all that stuff going on why it's the last days this is the last generation this is what's going on we see it happening before our eyes and sometimes we don't know what to do about what we need to do is pray pray for your children pray for them get them to the altar get them to god before it's too late because this generation is destroying them the generation destroying everything can destroy this the last time if only the righteous gonna escape get inside christ before it's too late hear the word and believe it god sent you a prophet amen believe the word amen in jesus christ's name let's go to amen um romans the 10th chapter amen praise god romans 10. amen so this is a bad generation that we living in you see the grace of god the bible says serve the lord and thy youth that's right in the early earlier you can get god in your life the more blessed you'll be should grow up in this world here because they get them early in jesus christ's name amen that's that's the key to life get god early amen before it's too late amen get them now lord have mercy amen and hold on to god amen because it's evil out there as evil time young people are going to scream doing things they shouldn't be doing amen praise god they out there living how they want to live they see people living like they got a lot so they want to follow that example so they try to get out there and do the same thing a lot of time that leads to death a man leads down the wrong road and about having plenty it's about serving the lord the bible said if you serve the lord he said he'll give you desires of your heart that's right so you serve god the bible says seek you for the kingdom of god and his writing he said all these things would be what it'll be added god to give them to you amen you give them to you freely the bible says freely given so god will give them to you freely you got to go out there and do the thing people are doing uh to get this stuff you guys have to serve god and god will do what he said he'll do amen praise god romans 10 and 1. my brother my heart desire and prayer to god for israel that they might be saved but i bear them wreck they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god you know you can be too churchy sometimes that what is your problem was they were so so churchy that again we hear what god was saying to him here god and sent them a savior jesus christ and it said we right we're gonna keep on doing what we're doing we all right we don't need you jesus and they crucified them so they didn't submit themselves to the righteousness of god they had their own righteousness you ain't got no righteousness where you get it from if you got it you ain't got nothing if you got him jesus the bible called him dirty rags so you ain't got no righteousness where you get you ain't got none you got to get his he's the only one righteous how you get his by believing the word amen we will have no righteousness no matter what you do that won't make you righteous giving a lot of money that won't make you righteous come into treasure all the time that's good that won't make you righteous you got to get his righteousness see we can have our own righteousness because we i got on a long dress i let my hair grow long i ain't cutting them no more i stopped that and all kinds of stuff so i'm righteous no that don't make you righteous nope that don't make you righteous either a lot of girls are they wear long dressed they ain't safe a lot of girls that got long hair they ain't saved see you're not righteous because of that oh i pay my tithes every sunday like i supposed to i don't that don't make you righteous that's self-righteousness come on somebody that's self-righteousness god ain't looking for that you're looking for us he wants you to humble yourself and just do what his words say and then he'll declare you righteous here's your problem was they wanted to work it out see work their own righteousness we look what we're doing we're bringing our offerings we're doing our sacrifice we're doing all this lord we're doing every look what we're doing well i don't want that see israel wanted to have their own righteousness and that's what a lot of people want today they want their own righteous they don't want god right they want they want righteousness look what i'm doing look what i got look where i look where i've been look at all the places i've been who i've been over here all that stuff that sounds good but that's not god righteousness you can't work your own righteousness you have to submit yourself the bible said and have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god he submit yourself to god righteousness but christ is the end of the law for writing everyone that believeth for moses describe it the righteousness of the law that the man which do those things shall live by them but the writings which is our faith speaketh on this why so is by faith amen so 11th verse amen sort uh for what the heart the man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession and made unto salvation so it's by faith that god declares you righteous not our own righteousness amen let's go to genesis 15. and maybe get ready to come to a close amen praise god i just want to be righteous that's all i want i want to be just like god so noah i want to be righteous in this generation it's the evil generation i know it is you ought to know too so the evil i want to be righteous lord how do i be righteous but to believe in your word for the day i'm living in amen believing that word and living by it a man walking with god and enoch did as a as a as nowhere did they walk with god see amen and god declared those men righteous god wants to do the same for us we got to believe god though amen genesis 15. amen y'all know the story abraham abraham believed god god told him he's gonna have a son and abraham believed god look at the fifth verse it's god the fourth verse of genesis 15 and behold the word of lord came unto him saying this shall not be not an ear but easier to come forth that our own bowels should be thou on earth everybody had those children hey man he came he approached god about that see lord what without giving me seeing i go childless and man he wanted to know why he was childish while he was going like this right here and then he was telling god i got these servants in my house and everything i've got i'ma give to them because i ain't got no seed and god brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said to him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he converted to him for righteousness just because he believed that god blessed them he believed god for the impossible something that never been done probably never be done again but he believed god and god honored his faith and god declared him righteous from that day abraham was declared righteous because he believed what god said that's all it is simple faith believing what god said believe in god for the impossible you believe god the bible says god imputed it to him for righteousness without works amen they'll go to romans 4. no works faith god won't put you righteous amen we know what kind of life abraham lived come on abraham walked with god to the bible he lived so close to god the god called abraham his friend that's right amen was called a friend of god amen wow he walked close with god amen he walked with god not god walking out we got to walk with god we might take god someplace he won't don't want to go we had to walk with him amen walk with the lord amen praise god let's go down romans the fourth chapter let's see what it says amen abraham believed god how many of y'all believed god this morning how many y'all believed god this morning all things are possible to them that what believe amen if you believe god god will impeach your righteousness he declares you righteous in his sight and not a man's side because man sees all our faults and you always got something to say about us but not god god don't see he sees his father remember when you be covered by the blood amen the lord don't see nothing but the bloody man amen when i see the blood i'll do what i'll pass over you here man so god don't see a man does oh hallelujah that way they get to criticize that ain't gonna get to say nothing bad about it so you can speak evil of no man go you never know what you might do one day man you might you might slip and fall man you you might do that same mistake you done talked about and said why did that just be best not to see them or do i pray see this is good not to say anything amen praise god so god god bless uh abraham amen believe god the bible say no no it works romans the fourth chapter amen he believed god for the impossible and god brought us the path because of his faith going on his faith did i say without it is about impossible to please who it's impossible to please god without faith so that we're looking for faith and what his word god came to know and speak a simple word that was going to rain noah believed it and began to build an ark and then god came to abraham so i'm going to give you a son do you ban or you're 90 years old but i'm a blessing he believed it god honor his faith and god declared the righteous amen god did that amen we can't declare ourselves righteous god got to declare us righteous in his sight that would man say man am i trying to declare you rocking you out there doing all kind of stuff but god he's gonna declare you right you're gonna make sure you're living right let me live right amen god ain't gonna put the writings upon a sinner gonna put a writing upon unbeliever god put the writings about something believe in somebody's life been chained they're going to live the word that abraham did bob said i know abraham that he will command his children after him that's right to keep the word of the lord to do justice and truth be god's i know abraham he's going to tell us children of truth he can make sure his children walk in the word see god knew abraham how many y'all telling you oh my god oh lord you got to tell your children the truth not hats but you got to tell them the truth oh lord have mercy you got to do it in the last thing if you're living in what oh man wrong with the full chapter don't be afraid tell them the truth you can't no you can't go there we don't want you to go there no no no can't go there i i just hate to say that when they they ain't being raised like you being right you're being raised to be a christian they they let them do anything and go anywhere do anything we raise you like that that way you can't go to them places well my why i can't go because i said so now that settles up with me caroline then when i say no that that's the end of it i don't change my mind no um when i say no that's boom it stop well why i can't go didn't i tell you no that's the end of it it's finished should be finished with you too should be the end of it no more conversation it's finished amen so that what it is it means wrong with the fourth chapter amen they don't understand what we as christians trying to achieve we're trying to achieve our children to live clean and holy that's i'm that's what we're trying to achieve and they don't understand that a lot of times because they see all their friends in the schoolhouse and different places doing certain things they don't understand what we're trying to accomplish as as christians come on somebody you're trying to accomplish something you want your daughter to deliver as clear as you can to the edge you ready to give that child away if that's right you're trying to do that that's you trying to you're trying to accomplish something you're trying to do that with a little boy that's saying we're trying to calm you're trying to raise them up they don't want to go out there and mess young girl's life up you're trying to accomplish something you're trying to raise them in the lord that's right but they don't understand that so that's what we got to hold that mercy we got to pray as hard we can and discipline your age lack discipline no not that right we don't talk about it they like what discipline we we scared to hit him for some reason i know what it is i ain't scared though mama don't let daddy hit me hand hard yep these hands are hard i had to lift steel with them see how it got hard and uh and i hear that she know i hit her because i i it hurts so we can't be afraid to discipline lord have mercy we can't be afraid to discipline without discipline the bible says spirit of wrongs for the child the child will go scream one day if you're on discipline how are you going to keep them scraped you don't discipline them you have to discipline them oh god and then oh lord roman the fourth chapter amen praise god amen well i know what it is amen praise the lord romans the fourth chapter let's see what god said here about abraham amen praise god what shall we say then that our father abraham had found as pertaining to the flesh as he had way of the glory but he said what not before god but what saith the scripture abraham believed god and was imputed to him for righteousness no works abraham believed god see none of him that workers reward not working of grace but of death but to him the worker not but believe it on him that justified the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even if they would also describe the blessing of the man whom god imputed righteousness without works saying blessed are there whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin he had a blessing lord hamlet let me be that man let me be that person lord you don't you don't sin too you don't want sin in punitive sweet descendants what death blessing is the man that god will not impute sin how did a blessing come because you believed the word you believe what god said about not when somebody else said you believe what god said amen abraham believed god come with his blessing then upon non-second upon the second decision only uh upon non-circumcision also if we say the fear of wrecking abraham for righteousness how would it then reckon when he was in circumcision or uncircumcision not in second decision but an unsecured i want you to listen to his part right here at the 11th verse real good and he received a sign of circumcision he received a sign and abraham did y'all know the second decision was that was a sign of his righteousness y'all know what the segregation is for us today how do you know what our circumcision is it's the holy ghost it's circumcised why would it come to circumcise your heart cut that stony heart on and put a god of flesh in it cut it out that heart had been stubborn against the word of god god cut that out and put a good heart inside there how do by the holy ghost the holy ghost come and change your heart you know oh hallelujah they don't come in the head the holy ghost comes to the heart that's right the bible says so the bible says the holy ghost the love of god and share the broad way and your hearts by the holy ghost we're just giving them not so the holy ghost comes to sacrifice that heart get their heart right it comes as a confirmation to confirm your faith abraham received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised so god gave him circumcision to seal his faith doesn't the holy ghost seal us come on somebody you feel by what the holy ghost what it does to come to feel you confirm you that god recognizes your faith that's what god do recognize somebody's faith this morning that's how you believe god got to recognize it gotta do something man he'll show you something you'll re he'll recognize your faith in abraham god recognize abraham's faith and give him the sign of circumcision it wasn't the truth thing god it was a type of the true baptism of the holy ghost that seals us into the kingdom of god to confirm our faith until you get the holy ghost you're not a christian i'll tell you y'all know that right you're just coming to church the bible said but one spirit we're all baptized into what one body that body is christ right so perhaps a person get uh get baptized with the holy ghost they're not a christian yeah you just come to church and that's keep on coming god made a promise you got to believe it and you confess it oh hallelujah amen so abraham amen god confirmed his faith gave him a sign of circumcision god confirms our faith he gives us the holy ghost literally proving that he know we are believers proving to know that we believe his word amen praise god he'll go to romans amen 9 and 30. amen praise god you want me you want god to confirm your faith i want god to confirm my faith i got the holy ghost you know what i still want to do more things from the lord so i want god to keep on confirming my faith i want him to show and to honor my faith amen that what i'm trusting and believing him for he's going to do it see i want him to confirm my faith that he did abraham he confirmed abraham faith amen hallelujah where we at romans the ninth chapter amen praise god amen 9 and 30. amen i got romans 9 and 30 down here i don't look what shall we say then that the gentile would follow not after writings have attained to the righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith see but israel will fall after the law of writing and have not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because it's sorted by the works thought not by faith but by as a word by the works of the law for they stumbled at their stumbling stone as it is written behold while they enzyme a stumbling stone a rock of offense whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so god justifies us by our faith see the gentiles that's us that's right amen look at another scripture look at the book of uh philippians talk about paul amen paul had to justify you know paul was a hard worker wasn't he saul working for the church doing everything he can for the church everything church tell him to do he did he was a good worker for the trip it wasn't working for god see you have to work for god don't work for man work for god a lot of people think that they work for man they're going to be saved but you won't gonna be saved because you're working man now you better make sure you're working for god you can work for man all you want to you better work for god paul was working for man everywhere the church sent him he did and he was doing evil at the same time he was killing god's people that's right but nevertheless he thought he was doing right but he was doing wrong so god had to turn them around god had to turn saul life around because the man was working too hard for the church then doing what god told him to do he was doing what the church wanted him to do sometimes we think we serving god can we do what a man tell us to do that don't mean we serving god amen we gotta do what god say do amen praise god if god tell you to do something do it amen praise god paul right here um was doing what the church wanted him to do and he thought he was right he thought he was he thought he was good he thought he would be saved but he wasn't he was lost to jesus came and got him that's right jesus came and got paul amen god called him a chosen vessel he had to go and get it he had to go and get him though see that god had to come and get us one day didn't god come and get you god came and got you god came and got me all right so god gotta do the same thing you always you gotta come and get us we don't start god god came and got us and god came and got saul amen paul and changed his life around paul with paul very religious very religious come on somebody very religious man can't you can't beat paul and religious you can't beat him in religion he had to be he told those pharisees i'm a pharisee of the pharisees uh uh um under the philippines he immediately he talks about it he knew what he had but all the things he said began the media i cut a loss for christ amen tonight uh philippians 3 and 9. amen praise god and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith see paul understood now that it wasn't by works he understood how he became righteous he understood one time he thought i was work doing whatever the church said do but now he came to a realization that is what christ believing the word of god that's what it's all about believing the word see that what makes you righteous amen let's say one more scripture hey man let's go to the book of peter the fourth chapter amen praise god how many i want to be righteous this morning i do i want to live righteous i want to be righteous hey man how am i doing by believing the word of god amen everything god words said we say amen that's right everything the word of god said we say amen we don't fuss about it we don't dispute it we just say amen amen because we want to guard the it to us amen praise god in due time amen first peter amen praise god first peter 4. in 18 episode 17 verse for the time has come that gentleman must begin at the house of god we need to get ourselves straight you know that it begin with us we need to

you mean i'm righteous i'm just going to be scarcely saved we're going to make it in by the grace of god i said we're going to make it in by the grace of god scarcely be saved wow that means we still need doing like we should be enough to be saved inside of god's side only be god mercy to get us in the only begotten mercy if you think we're doing so much sometimes for the lord and really when it comes down to the end it's only going to be by the mercy of god we're gonna be saved the righteous scarcely be gonna be saved scarcely now that means that you still ain't good enough i'm not good enough but god gonna have so much mercy on us he's gonna save us see the rights are scarcely going to be saved what do you think that my people out there ain't living right we're gonna be there
