[34:13] despisers of those that are good
[34:16] traitors he High high-m minded lovers of
[34:19] pleasure more than lovers of God having
[34:23] a form of godliness but denying the
[34:26] power thereof from such turn away for of
[34:30] this sort are they which creep in the
[34:33] houses and Lead captive silly women
[34:35] Laden with sins LED away with diverse
[34:38] lust ever learning and never able to
[34:42] come to the knowledge of the truth may
[34:44] God bless your reading of his word you
[34:46] may be
[34:47] seated by the grace of God tonight we
[34:50] just want to minister for short moment
[34:53] amen and I I entitled it the last days
[34:56] amen the last days how many believe we
[34:59] living in the last days amen amen we can
[35:02] see the signs of the time and you know
[35:04] looking at some of the things I I was
[35:06] praying the other day I was even when
[35:08] the storm was coming out of nowhere
[35:11] Sunday and I was praying I said Lord you
[35:13] know know that all these things got to
[35:15] hit the earth and they ain't going to
[35:17] stop but I said God just just watch over
[35:20] us don't let it be too bad and you know
[35:23] I was thanking God that it seemed to
[35:26] have you know it just passed over us but
[35:28] every little every little Victory you
[35:30] know God gives us you know as time go on
[35:33] and Christian Journey you learn to thank
[35:36] God for every little Victory amen and
[35:38] you also learn that that you can go to
[35:42] God for anything amen amen whether it
[35:45] seems to be out of your hands out of
[35:47] your um control or whatever it might be
[35:50] but you can go to God for anything and
[35:52] see that's what I believe that he wants
[35:54] to get us to to that place to where we
[35:57] can just lean on them and we see like we
[35:59] said the signs of the time things
[36:01] transpire taking place that that you
[36:04] don't have no control over right am but
[36:07] it's going to have to I believe what God
[36:09] is wanting to do is push us back into
[36:12] that Faith realm back to that place to
[36:15] where I was thinking the other day I was
[36:16] laying down I said Lord you know I'm
[36:18] just thinking about you know how far the
[36:21] the church world has gone and how far
[36:24] they've gotten away from what real
[36:26] Christianity is
[36:28] amen gotten away from the the the the
[36:31] power Hallelujah the signs and the
[36:34] Wonders got away from those things
[36:36] because the times going on and and in
[36:40] and
[36:41] uh not education but the technology and
[36:44] all going on and so what it is now
[36:47] people look more to those things than
[36:50] looking to God himself but no matter how
[36:53] much
[36:54] Advance this world gets
[36:57] Jesus is still the answer to all our
[36:59] problems amen come on do y'all believe
[37:02] that amen come on no matter
[37:04] how how much money you got amen no
[37:08] matter how much whatever it is you know
[37:10] I've been witnessing a lot at job lately
[37:13] and one of the guys he was telling me
[37:14] about his
[37:15] daughter in college and what she was
[37:17] going to be uh I forgot but his his
[37:20] other son is going to be a pilot and he
[37:22] was saying I hope I get to live to see
[37:23] him you know succeed and so we other guy
[37:27] I was picking at him we said you ought
[37:28] to speak positive you know he was like
[37:30] yeah but he said you know you can go any
[37:32] minute he said I can walk out this door
[37:34] right here and fall dead and we said
[37:37] that's true so I asked them I said well
[37:40] if that was the case if that's if that
[37:42] happens I said where's your soul I asked
[37:45] him that begin to talk to him about his
[37:48] I said are you ready to meet God then if
[37:50] you if you come to the grips of that are
[37:53] you ready to meet God and he sat there
[37:55] and he paused he says well I don't know
[37:58] and I said so you know that's the thing
[38:01] I said you understanding that life is so
[38:04] short right you understanding that
[38:08] things can turn friend of mine passed
[38:10] away the other day at 40 years old it
[38:13] hit me kind of hard but I said things
[38:16] can turn but being aware of that is one
[38:19] thing but if if God has allowed you to
[38:23] be aware of that what are you doing
[38:25] about your Soul's salvation come on so I
[38:29] begin to ask you know a lot of people I
[38:31] says you know you saved talk to them you
[38:34] know because I said that's the one more
[38:36] important the one most important thing
[38:39] out your Christian Journey you can sing
[38:41] you can play you can do all these other
[38:43] things you can do all but where is your
[38:45] soul with God come on you got to
[38:48] consider that Hallelujah and even we all
[38:52] we often I I said Lord you know what it
[38:54] is God always brings us back to that you
[38:57] know I I find out today I says you know
[39:00] just reading here we talking about the
[39:02] last days you know uh as Paul is writing
[39:05] the letter of Timothy and tell him about
[39:07] the things that we ought to look out for
[39:09] in the last days so many things he named
[39:12] you know we we a go over them all like
[39:14] we did the other other day but so many
[39:16] things he named that it's going to be in
[39:18] the last days we going to have to deal
[39:20] with but I says what the what the devil
[39:24] will will do he'll have you and I
[39:27] fighting one
[39:29] another and yet we still got all these
[39:31] things to contend with come on the Bible
[39:35] says they they'll hate you just cuz
[39:37] you're doing good you love the truth
[39:40] they'll hate you just for that right
[39:44] dealing with a world where the people
[39:46] they they love pleasure more than they
[39:49] love
[39:50] God come on love their own selves and
[39:53] pleasure more than they love God talk to
[39:56] I said you know I had a dream and in a
[39:57] dream uh Guys somebody was wanting to
[39:59] get baptized and I was talking to him
[40:01] and I says I says I ask you something I
[40:04] said you willing to give those
[40:05] cigarettes
[40:06] up and you know what they did they held
[40:10] on to those cigarettes and said they'd
[40:12] rather keep the cigarettes because that
[40:14] was more valuable to them than their
[40:18] than their soul
[40:20] Hallelujah but it it might not be
[40:23] cigarettes for you it might whatever it
[40:25] is I want to say what's more valueable
[40:27] to you tonight come on you got to
[40:29] consider that sometimes it could be
[40:33] children wife house car money what's
[40:35] valuable you see what it is when you
[40:37] come to God you get you go behind that
[40:41] Veil it's just you and God Alone come on
[40:43] your eyes got to be single whether you
[40:46] young or old it's just you and God Alone
[40:48] back there come on the world is shut out
[40:51] right but the problem is today people
[40:54] don't they don't never go to that
[40:56] experience do they
[40:57] come on they never go to that extreme
[41:00] because the the the church seems
[41:02] sometime just to adopt that you can just
[41:04] come in maybe cry some tears and and
[41:07] everything all right come on in get
[41:09] baptized but never uh uh preach or lead
[41:13] the people into a personal relationship
[41:16] with God and that's why they you know
[41:19] they say just confess your sins but you
[41:22] confess him and do it again confess him
[41:23] and do it again confess him and do it
[41:25] again that's because the heart never
[41:26] changed
[41:28] come on but you know one thing about God
[41:32] he won't force himself on you come on
[41:35] you got to be willing Hallelujah to open
[41:38] up and say God you know Save Me From
[41:41] Myself come in God and and and and do
[41:45] something in my heart come on cuz I want
[41:47] to change I'm looking at myself in the
[41:50] mirror of the word and I don't see the
[41:53] reflection of you I don't see Hallelujah
[41:56] that image you know one thing about it
[41:58] you know he says they be he High minded
[42:01] right ever learning but never coming
[42:03] into the knowledge of the truth I said
[42:06] one thing about you know that early
[42:08] church in which the the first and the
[42:11] last church should be the same one thing
[42:13] about that early church before they went
[42:16] out you know before they even went out
[42:19] to preach the gospel Jesus told him to
[42:21] go t in Jerusalem right to you be
[42:24] endured with power what was that power
[42:27] he was going to send back the Holy Ghost
[42:30] come on you can't be an effective
[42:32] witness without the Holy Ghost it come
[42:35] on Hallelujah you can't testify right
[42:39] without the Holy Ghost come on so they
[42:42] had to wait on it but today what happens
[42:44] today the church jump right past that
[42:47] don't they come on let's be real look at
[42:51] I said God what it is we want the
[42:54] anointing I don't know about you I said
[42:56] God I want the anointing
[42:57] am I want the the presence of God come
[43:00] on more than just to say oh you big walk
[43:03] no but you need it to live right you
[43:06] need it the demons and the Devils you
[43:09] and I got to contend with you going to
[43:10] need a supernatural God more than just
[43:13] what that's what it is I don't know
[43:15] what's in the minds of people sometimes
[43:17] maybe think that oh oh we we in the
[43:20] message or whatever they want to say it
[43:22] don't matter don't I says what it is
[43:25] where where is your soul come on
[43:27] Goliath coming one day amen come on
[43:30] what's the used to me all the Mysteries
[43:33] all those headed highed things just like
[43:36] Saul Head and Shoulders above everybody
[43:38] wasn't he but when Goliath showed up
[43:41] come on that didn't mean a thing did it
[43:45] Hallelujah but what meant the world was
[43:49] that they had a little boy David in the
[43:50] camp what he had different Hallelujah
[43:54] from the everybody else was he had Faith
[43:58] Amen to be able to take God at his word
[44:01] and say Lord this is what you promised
[44:03] now I'm going to get it hallelujah amen
[44:06] not trusting in the slingshot like they
[44:08] say even those stones but what he was
[44:12] trusting in he said how we let him defy
[44:15] the armies of the Living God come on God
[44:17] gave us promises we preached the
[44:20] promises but when the trial come why you
[44:23] ain't standing on them Hallelujah come
[44:25] on oh Jesus and it's the truth ain't it
[44:29] preach healing
[44:33] right preach Miracle signs and wonders
[44:36] laying hands on the sick but when your
[44:39] biggest trial come Hallelujah so many
[44:42] times people they don't know what to do
[44:45] do they Hallelujah because they missing
[44:49] that the the leadership of the Holy
[44:51] Ghost come on what it is I don't know
[44:54] about you but in my time when I when I
[44:56] didn't know what to do Hallelujah and it
[44:59] happens of you have times you don't know
[45:02] what to do the spirit comes and he leads
[45:04] you what to do amen amen he'll open the
[45:07] word that's what it is the the Holy
[45:10] Ghost he'll open the word to you come on
[45:13] Amen scriptures become real to you then
[45:16] amen you seeing it in a different light
[45:18] because now in your time of trouble he's
[45:21] giving you what it takes to overcome
[45:24] Hallelujah one thing I like what David
[45:26] told go he said after this day the whole
[45:28] world going to know that there's a God
[45:30] in Israel come on what it was what did
[45:33] he have different he had Faith didn't
[45:35] you you know I says they're ever
[45:37] learning but never coming into the
[45:39] knowledge of the truth amen come on what
[45:41] is
[45:42] truth hallelujah but what it is I said
[45:45] Lord It's
[45:46] 2025 how can many
[45:50] today just reach back and grab have
[45:53] simple Faith
[45:54] Hallelujah cuz so many things
[45:57] in their view Hallelujah so many things
[45:59] blocking Cloud their minds so much in
[46:02] their people view but how can they what
[46:05] it is God puts us in
[46:07] positions the way nothing else
[46:09] Hallelujah but a miracle we'll do amen
[46:12] he'll do that come on but even in those
[46:15] times people don't turn the right way do
[46:18] they come on but I says you know I was
[46:22] been doing a lot of witness and stuff
[46:23] lately and I said you know one of the
[46:25] guys at work he was saying uh he was he
[46:29] was pretty deep pretty
[46:31] intellectual and he was breaking down
[46:33] all kinds of things cuz he's reading so
[46:35] many books and he kept saying the Bible
[46:37] said this I said man show us in the
[46:39] Bible where that's at he said oh out s
[46:41] cuz he read he ended so much he get it
[46:44] all mixed
[46:45] up but just talking with him and um you
[46:49] know about all those things and I says
[46:51] you know one thing about it I said you
[46:55] can have all that knowledge Hallelujah I
[46:58] says but what about Crossing Jordan
[47:01] River come on Amen what about the life
[47:05] that's got to get you out the
[47:07] ground come on you know do you know
[47:10] where you stand with God out of all of
[47:12] that or do you still question even after
[47:14] all of that Hallelujah come on if
[47:17] anybody knew what the importance of the
[47:20] spirit
[47:21] was more than knowledge I believe it
[47:23] would have been Paul come on taught at
[47:26] the knew all those things but when he
[47:29] when he was knocked down come on and the
[47:32] light Shone about him then he said all
[47:35] those things that you know he thought he
[47:37] knew I like how Paul said when a man you
[47:40] know knowledge puff up he said when you
[47:41] think you know something you don't know
[47:43] nothing come
[47:45] on but he had to realize when he met
[47:48] that light come on that the spirit meant
[47:51] more than all that intellectual stuff
[47:54] come on what he thought he knew he had
[47:56] to forget about it didn't he now the
[47:59] Holy Ghost was going to teach him come
[48:02] on Amen in the word what come on you
[48:07] know I was I was I was looking at things
[48:10] about manmade Creeds and dogs come on
[48:13] and I was looking at the Apostles Creed
[48:15] and all those
[48:16] things and I was looking at so much
[48:19] doing a little bit of studying and stuff
[48:21] but I says the thing
[48:23] is it might have started with this a
[48:25] little bit started with a little bit now
[48:27] you way out there Hallelujah with
[48:29] beliefs that don't line no way near up
[48:32] to the Bible right come on can't bring
[48:35] it through the word and then want God to
[48:38] to uh uh acknowledge that or vindicate
[48:41] that God can't V what God vindicates is
[48:44] his word come on that's what the whole
[48:48] message was supposed to do bring you
[48:49] back to the word come on open the word
[48:52] to you
[48:53] Hallelujah where the life is come on not
[48:57] just saying this quote now go come on
[48:59] but no power bring you back to the life
[49:03] Hallelujah come on but you got to find
[49:06] it somewhere I believe down on your
[49:07] knees hallelujah amen you going you
[49:10] ain't going to just find it just
[49:11] anywhere God going to put you on your
[49:12] knees come on commune and fellowship
[49:16] with him but people don't want to spend
[49:17] time with God do they come on Hallelujah
[49:22] I'm stirred tonight come
[49:24] on I know it's sound like but I'm
[49:27] stirred because I says this guy the
[49:30] other day had all this stuff really and
[49:33] I I begin to say what what stirred my
[49:35] heart though he was saying all
[49:38] this and uh one of the guys in the room
[49:41] you wouldn't even
[49:43] expect he says he says man he says
[49:47] sometimes cuz the God told me he says
[49:49] well the Bible talks about angels and
[49:51] demons but nobody never saw
[49:54] one I said I hey he said about God I
[49:57] said I don't know about you but I see
[49:58] God every
[50:00] day but I begin to tell him about some
[50:02] experiences and stuff and he saids well
[50:05] I know lot so what it is and that's the
[50:08] way the people Minds me today come on
[50:10] they read a Bible they quote it they
[50:13] talk about it but to really have faith
[50:15] to believe in it they don't believe it
[50:18] they think maybe it's oh they saying
[50:20] everything but the days of the miracle
[50:22] has passed but that's what their action
[50:24] show but I was talking with the guy
[50:26] about that one of the guys at work
[50:29] unlikely person he says um you know he
[50:32] says man I'm going tell you something he
[50:35] told the other guy he says sometimes I
[50:38] just be riding down the in in the car he
[50:40] said I don't hardly ever go to church he
[50:42] says but I was raised in church he said
[50:44] but I'll be riding in the car
[50:46] sometimes and he said something will
[50:48] just come over
[50:49] me and he says I'll just out of my mouth
[50:52] I'll just start saying thank you Lord
[50:53] for blessing me he said he'll just start
[50:56] praising God in the car by itself you
[50:59] know he said cuz something then the guy
[51:00] said you say something come in the car
[51:02] what you mean
[51:04] right so he says I'm going to give you
[51:07] another example he said Ernest he says
[51:10] when I first met him he didn't tell me
[51:12] he was preacher Christian and all that
[51:15] he says but he come around me every time
[51:17] he came around me I felt something
[51:20] different and I was stirred just
[51:22] listening to him he says it's like he
[51:24] can walk in the room sometimes
[51:27] and it we could be going on but
[51:29] conversations changed he says and then
[51:31] after a while he said I always knew it
[51:33] was something different about Earnest
[51:35] because he bringing something with him
[51:37] right so I begin to talk to the guy
[51:40] thinking that it's something made up cuz
[51:42] he want to feel what what we talking
[51:44] about now he want to feel it and I begin
[51:46] to tell him I said see that's the
[51:49] presence of God we talking about I says
[51:52] you you know all this other
[51:54] things but yet you don't know the
[51:57] presence you know all those other things
[51:59] but yet you don't know what it feels
[52:01] like Hallelujah when the Shak kind of
[52:03] Glory come down you never been in that
[52:06] but the thing about it is God ain't
[52:08] withholding it from you he want to show
[52:10] you how to get there come on but it's
[52:13] going to be not head and high minded
[52:15] Hallelujah not you might not be out in
[52:18] the Forefront nobody can see you but
[52:20] you'll be in the closet somewhere
[52:21] praying in the Midnight Hour amen
[52:24] hallelujah you'll spend some long time
[52:27] with God shut in a hidden life with
[52:30] Christ come on Hallelujah but people
[52:34] want to all out in the front come on I
[52:35] don't know but I love that hidden life I
[52:38] love those Community I can talk to God
[52:41] about stuff I can't talk to nobody else
[52:43] about and he understands Hallelujah am
[52:46] comes down and comforts me in my time
[52:49] Hallelujah of
[52:51] need come on and he wants to do that for
[52:53] you too he wants to do that for the
[52:55] whole world
[52:57] but they got other avenues and other
[52:59] options that they run to come on but God
[53:01] is standing right there saying here I am
[53:04] cast your cares on me come on take my
[53:08] yoke upon you and learn them Hallelujah
[53:11] come
[53:12] onk what I say is uh God was talking
[53:15] like that and I was telling him I said
[53:16] that's what it is you know it it's it's
[53:19] it's the presence of God all of that and
[53:22] I begin to tell him he say so you mean
[53:24] all of this don't mean nothing
[53:27] I says it ain't is it relevant to your
[53:31] salvation come on might be good to know
[53:33] not say don't just be in the dark about
[53:35] things come on cuz God gave it to us for
[53:38] us to know it come on what I says don't
[53:42] miss it's like Paul was saying here you
[53:45] know he was saying one place I believe
[53:47] he saying you know to learn of
[53:50] him he was saying
[53:53] uh hear in the hear in the um
[53:57] in the ninth verse this this is the
[53:59] thing I said you can know all these
[54:02] things but come on it's the spirit you
[54:05] nothing can't take the place of the
[54:07] Spirit come on his presence the Holy
[54:10] Ghost got to bring life to the
[54:12] word if anybody knew that Paul knew that
[54:16] he had a Zeal for God didn't he killing
[54:18] the Church of God nobody couldn't live
[54:21] it just like how he was living how close
[54:23] he was but when he ran when God caught
[54:26] up with him one day come on he realized
[54:30] that was the most important thing come
[54:32] on Amen how many believe that tonight
[54:35] come on like I said Goliath coming y'all
[54:37] believe that amen come on the world wins
[54:40] all those things coming and it's going
[54:42] to try you you know God allows that
[54:44] that's how God got it set up right and
[54:47] the one that you think don't know
[54:50] nothing or the one you think he ain't on
[54:52] your level or she ain't on your level
[54:54] what she have or he have what it takes
[54:57] to make it through the storm Hallelujah
[54:59] I was telling my wife the other day it's
[55:01] it's a girl at
[55:03] work
[55:04] and when you look at her she looked
[55:08] like you know uh just
[55:11] somebody people I grew up
[55:14] around you know it look kind of rough
[55:16] like character
[55:17] maybe but she's got she was telling me
[55:21] about her children her five children and
[55:24] uh she was telling me about how her
[55:28] nieces and all those dress and how she
[55:30] saw them at the wedding and how she was
[55:33] she was going on about how these young
[55:35] girls put on all kind of
[55:37] clothes and presenting their self all in
[55:40] front of a man you know like a
[55:42] prostitute then he hand her a certain
[55:44] way to take it then people get upset she
[55:46] says but I'm telling them you throw it
[55:48] out there in front of them Hallelujah
[55:51] come on but I listened to her for a
[55:53] while and I said sometimes
[55:56] she look like she got more sense
[55:58] Hallelujah than the people that's
[56:00] supposed to know better right come on I
[56:04] was telling my wife that the other day
[56:06] but it's the truth
[56:09] right it's one thing to be able to see
[56:12] Hallelujah from the eyes naturalized but
[56:16] it's another thing when God open your
[56:17] spiritual eyes Hallelujah so might might
[56:21] look good come on it might look worth
[56:23] pleasant but it's death come on Amen God
[56:26] showed you that because he opened your
[56:28] eyes am I thank God for opening my eyes
[56:30] Hallelujah am come on I thank God for
[56:33] those times when I would have made great
[56:37] mistakes but he comes by through the
[56:40] word of God sometime just a simple
[56:43] sermon or whatever God send somebody by
[56:45] your way and you recognize that that's
[56:48] the that's God speaking to you and you
[56:51] better take heed come on but what it is
[56:53] you learn to be led by the spirit amen
[56:56] come on not by what you feel all the
[57:00] other things or what oh this hard to be
[57:02] got do it this way come on Hallelujah he
[57:06] ain't going to lead you outside his word
[57:07] but I said God I want to stand in your
[57:09] word at all cost come on Hallelujah but
[57:13] what it
[57:14] is I said you know just talking with the
[57:17] god I says this is this is the part here
[57:21] the the ninth verse he
[57:25] says but they shall proceed no further
[57:28] talking about the men of corrupt Minds
[57:30] repr probate concerning Faith but they
[57:31] shall proceed no further for their Folly

[1:04:42] Dark Hour
[1:04:44] [Applause]
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:50] [Applause]
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:04:54] amen praise God
[1:04:56] we're not just in the last days we at
[1:04:58] the end of the last
[1:05:00] days so by the grace of God we
[1:05:03] appreciate the word
[1:05:04] tonight you
[1:05:08] know I was thinking how God hides
[1:05:12] himself in
[1:05:13] Simplicity and reveals himself in the
[1:05:17] same God speaks so
[1:05:20] simple he's there even when we don't
[1:05:23] recognize that he he's there he's
[1:05:26] talking to us even though we're not
[1:05:28] listening
[1:05:30] sometimes sometimes God talked to us and
[1:05:34] speaks to us and and we think it's just
[1:05:39] our own thoughts or just something a
[1:05:45] coincidence I remember when God echoed
[1:05:48] his voice to me it it it was
[1:05:53] loud and I know it was the my time
[1:05:56] to come to
[1:05:59] him it's going to church
[1:06:03] and off and on and but when God speak to
[1:06:07] you you know that you come to the end of
[1:06:09] the
[1:06:11] road you know when you're in it's
[1:06:14] come talking to brother Nathan he
[1:06:18] said you often times tell when God spoke
[1:06:21] to him and come to the end of the
[1:06:24] road you can be young but when God speak
[1:06:27] to
[1:06:28] you things
[1:06:30] change when God spoke to Samuel things
[1:06:36] change you thought he was an Eli talking
[1:06:39] sometime we can get the voice of God
[1:06:43] confused it's St it's just something
[1:06:45] that God is leading us to but we think
[1:06:49] sometimes you
[1:06:51] know it's just something that it's
[1:06:54] happening
[1:06:56] and sometimes we don't know the leading
[1:06:58] of the
[1:06:59] Lord God leads us away from the things
[1:07:02] that we think we
[1:07:04] want things that we think we
[1:07:09] need and way he leads us is just like
[1:07:12] Abraham we're going on a journey but we
[1:07:14] don't know where we
[1:07:16] going but we know that God called
[1:07:19] us he speaks to our hearts he speaks to
[1:07:22] us amen and we know he's speaking to to
[1:07:25] us and we are Jour and we taking it step
[1:07:28] by step amen amen every step we
[1:07:34] take God I don't know how I'm going to
[1:07:36] make
[1:07:38] it but I know you lead me yes Lord
[1:07:42] Jesus sometimes we don't know we we
[1:07:45] don't have trust in our own ability our
[1:07:47] own self that we can make
[1:07:51] it as a Christian
[1:07:55] but God when he speaks to us all we got
[1:07:59] to do is
[1:08:01] yield and surrender to his
[1:08:04] voice and when we surrender God began to
[1:08:10] bless it's all about
[1:08:14] surrendering so tonight we thank God for
[1:08:16] the
[1:08:18] word I'm send surrender while you have a
[1:08:21] chance
[1:08:27] while we have a chance to
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:32] surrender we surrender to the voice of
[1:08:35] God amen
[1:08:38] amen I look
[1:08:40] at we the biggest mistake that you can
[1:08:44] make in
[1:08:48] life is when God call
[1:08:51] you you go the other direction
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:09:01] sometimes I look at different ones
[1:09:03] sometimes family
[1:09:06] members you can fast you can pray you
[1:09:10] can do everything you
[1:09:14] can sometime you don't even know what
[1:09:17] they
[1:09:18] just
[1:09:20] gone there's no
[1:09:22] return but you still there standing in
[1:09:25] the got with all you
[1:09:27] got still there praying seeking
[1:09:31] God y'all
[1:09:33] know this is serious
[1:09:36] business when we dealing with God it
[1:09:38] ain't going to
[1:09:39] be you just doing something I'm just
[1:09:42] doing what I feel led to do it's got to
[1:09:44] be
[1:09:46] God it's got to be God at the end you
[1:09:50] got to be certain it's
[1:09:52] God you just can't do it cuz I I just
[1:09:55] feel like I want to do this I want to do
[1:09:58] that when you're dealing with God it's
[1:10:00] got to be
[1:10:03] God you don't take a chance with your
[1:10:06] soul you don't
[1:10:09] play with your own soul you got to know
[1:10:14] it's
[1:10:18] God probably God talking about being
[1:10:21] certain of
[1:10:23] God you got to be certain
[1:10:29] I know we spend most of our
[1:10:31] lives and we just do what we want to do
[1:10:34] what we led to
[1:10:37] do but the Bible said whatsoever you do
[1:10:40] in words of deed do it all in the name
[1:10:42] of the
[1:10:43] Lord he said they that are led by the
[1:10:45] spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:10:50] God whatever we do we ought to ask God
[1:10:53] is it all right yes amen amen Lord if is
[1:10:58] it all right for me to do this or
[1:11:02] that praying the morning God lead me in
[1:11:06] the right direction amen Lord guide me
[1:11:09] and and and and and Lord watch over my
[1:11:13] steps that I'll do the right thing amen
[1:11:17] that I'll be led by your spirit amen God
[1:11:21] keep me in the way amen can't keep
[1:11:24] myself
[1:11:29] I asked the boys just before I came out
[1:11:32] I said y'all pray for
[1:11:35] me all of a sudden I was feeling so
[1:11:39] bad and uh I see y'all pray with me pray
[1:11:42] for
[1:11:43] me you know and I told him I said you
[1:11:46] know it's like this you could be here
[1:11:49] today and brother Ernie said that and
[1:11:52] you can be gone just like that boom
[1:11:56] gone and I thought about it I says I got
[1:11:59] to take this thing
[1:12:01] serious I got to start lining up things
[1:12:06] in
[1:12:07] life because I could be gone
[1:12:10] [Music]
[1:12:11] tomorrow and it not only and I told I
[1:12:14] told him simply it might have made shook
[1:12:16] him up a little bit but I said I could
[1:12:18] be
[1:12:19] gone I I said cuz what I'm dealing with
[1:12:22] right now I need y'all pray
[1:12:26] and the boys prayed with me then they
[1:12:28] went and told their
[1:12:33] mama daddy back that's
[1:12:37] sick she said you all right I said I'm
[1:12:40] all
[1:12:41] right she said you sure you all right I
[1:12:43] said I'm all right I know they had told
[1:12:47] her
[1:12:49] daddy but it it was serious because I
[1:12:53] thought on those moments
[1:12:55] you know you can come into some hard
[1:12:57] situations
[1:12:58] and I mean things that are happening to
[1:13:01] you you don't know what's going
[1:13:03] on and you say
[1:13:06] well I got to I I got to make get my
[1:13:10] business straight cuz in any
[1:13:14] time you can
[1:13:17] go and everybody
[1:13:20] that say oh brother Simmons is all right
[1:13:24] uh brother J's all right brother J we
[1:13:27] don't
[1:13:28] know one of those bad feelings could
[1:13:32] just we
[1:13:34] gone one of those moments where you know
[1:13:39] you're just tired and don't want to get
[1:13:41] up out of the bed
[1:13:44] sometimes and you one of those moments
[1:13:47] can I just sleep or rest a little while
[1:13:51] longer but you know you kids can't stand
[1:13:55] in the bed you got to get up it's it's
[1:14:00] 6:00 it's time to get up 6:00 in the
[1:14:03] morning well yeah been waiting get up at
[1:14:07] 7 this the
[1:14:08] [Music]
[1:14:10] morning oh then s
[1:14:13] come you can't take it you can't take it
[1:14:16] past s it's
[1:14:17] hard

[1:14:31] don't know about y'all but I got to get
[1:14:34] up I got to
[1:14:36] move but the days would come when you
[1:14:41] can't get
[1:14:43] up the hour come when you
[1:14:47] can't I was thinking about my brother
[1:14:49] Nathan and I
[1:14:52] remember when he was so weak when I
[1:14:55] would pray for him I feel his
[1:14:58] weakness and
[1:15:00] uh he couldn't even feed himself sister
[1:15:04] CA was feeding him and
[1:15:07] all and I was praying that God give him
[1:15:11] strength I just praying God strengthen
[1:15:14] him Lord God I saw how weak he was and
[1:15:17] sometime you know it might look like he
[1:15:19] was strong enough but he wasn't strong
[1:15:22] enough you know
[1:15:25] and I look at him now and I thank the
[1:15:28] Lord I said God you're a miracle worker
[1:15:31] amen amen but it could be any of us at
[1:15:35] any
[1:15:37] time go God has I mean it's
[1:15:43] simple so I'm saying the the walk that
[1:15:46] you walk as a Christian take it serious
[1:15:50] amen life that you're living take it
[1:15:53] serious
[1:15:55] because you only have one life to
[1:15:59] live and you got to be careful how you
[1:16:02] live this life amen because the god that
[1:16:05] gave you the life is going to call you
[1:16:08] in question about what he the life that
[1:16:11] he gave
[1:16:13] you as God servant say he'll call you in
[1:16:16] question the life that I gave you what
[1:16:18] did you do with it amen
[1:16:22] amen was it a life of play at you did
[1:16:25] you throw it away like the man throw the
[1:16:28] talent away said God I know you
[1:16:33] was what kind of person you was and and
[1:16:38] the man that had two talents he gained
[1:16:41] more one that had five and but the one
[1:16:45] that had
[1:16:47] one and some people respond like the man
[1:16:50] had
[1:16:51] one we waste it
[1:16:55] or we'll bury
[1:16:57] it and when he come back here here goes
[1:17:01] what you gave
[1:17:02] me but God is looking for
[1:17:05] us he told Adam and Eve he said be
[1:17:08] fruitful and what multip
[1:17:11] multiply God is looking for you to be
[1:17:15] fruitful and to
[1:17:17] multiply be fruitful and multiply amen
[1:17:21] amen he he's looking for when he came to
[1:17:24] the fct Tre and saw no F he cursed it be
[1:17:28] fruitful and
[1:17:31] multiply God wants to see fruit out of
[1:17:34] our Christian walk fruits out of our
[1:17:37] Christian experience God wants you to go
[1:17:41] forth and bring forth fruit amen praise
[1:17:45] God your life should be a testimony and
[1:17:48] a witness and a light that somebody
[1:17:50] would see it and they would be able to
[1:17:52] come to Jesus amen
[1:17:56] have you won one soul to
[1:18:00] Jesus have you led one soul to
[1:18:04] Jesus have you even uh had one soul to
[1:18:08] come to
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:12] church look around
[1:18:15] you think about
[1:18:17] it God hides himself in Simplicity the
[1:18:21] little that I God gave me can I use it
[1:18:26] or will I abuse
[1:18:28] it God wants you to
[1:18:32] use the little the gift that he gave us
[1:18:36] and not to abuse it
[1:18:39] amen use it to glorify God and don't
[1:18:43] abuse
[1:18:44] it
[1:18:46] because only that which is done for
