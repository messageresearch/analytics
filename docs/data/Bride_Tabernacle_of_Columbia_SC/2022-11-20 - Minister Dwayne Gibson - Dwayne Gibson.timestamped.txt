[36:19] Christ's name amen
[36:21] praise the Lord let you determined us
[36:23] Amen to the Book of Matthew
[36:28] The Book of Matthew
[36:35] the fourth chapter
[36:51] let me begin after 17 verse
[36:55] from that time
[36:57] Jesus began to preach and to say repent
[37:01] for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand let
[37:05] us pray
[37:05] Lord God we have read your holy word now
[37:08] Lord it's in your hands do what you want
[37:10] to do with it in Jesus Christ's name
[37:12] amen you may be seated
[37:15] amen a call to repentance
[37:19] a call to repentance sometime you want
[37:22] to go you call for a preacher amen you
[37:25] don't know what he's going to preach but
[37:26] he got the preach what the law give him
[37:27] that's right
[37:28] you got to preach what God give you for
[37:30] the people because someone needs it
[37:32] praise God so he call to repentance this
[37:35] morning and you know it's something that
[37:37] we live in an age that you don't hear
[37:39] much about repentance anymore
[37:42] people just come to church and they
[37:44] worship but no repentance is called for
[37:48] and I believe now more than ever is a
[37:51] time of repentance we need to come to
[37:53] repentance before God you said Brother
[37:55] Gibson why are you saying we need to
[37:58] come to repentance because we do a lot
[38:00] of wrong sometime and never repent
[38:03] I said we do a lot of raw sometime and
[38:06] never repent we go on like nothing
[38:08] happened but I said the time now the
[38:10] call for repentions
[38:14] and people come to church and never
[38:17] repent to the Lord and never feel sorry
[38:19] for the thing they have done the things
[38:21] they have said and the things that
[38:23] they're doing so they never feel sorry
[38:25] for that they come to church and there's
[38:27] no repentance and sometimes that's why
[38:29] we can't see the power of God because
[38:31] God knows there's no repentance
[38:33] there's no repentance what does that
[38:35] word repent mean the means to uh feel
[38:39] deeply sorry for or wrong that you have
[38:42] done
[38:43] deeply sorrow uh uh Contrition for a
[38:47] wrong that you have done some sin some
[38:50] wrongdoing you have done you you call
[38:53] you you realize that you did it and then
[38:55] you repent from you feel sorry that
[38:57] you've done that
[38:58] amen people on this day they can do all
[39:00] kind of evil and won't repent
[39:03] come to church like they never did
[39:05] nothing wrong but there's a call for
[39:07] repentance this morning
[39:09] amen come repent before the law not
[39:12] before me but before the law why you got
[39:14] to repent because you must make you want
[39:17] to make Heaven your home
[39:19] amen the first principle of Christianity
[39:21] is what repent
[39:23] at the first principle when you come to
[39:25] God if Jesus can't preach and repent why
[39:28] because the kingdom of God in their
[39:30] hands that was the first message that
[39:33] Jesus preached on that was his first
[39:34] coming his first message was what repent
[39:39] now he wasn't talking to Sinners he was
[39:41] talking to religious people he was
[39:43] talking to his own people remember he
[39:45] came under his owners under what
[39:46] received him not he was not talking to
[39:49] the center right there he was talking to
[39:51] Israel because all people that supposed
[39:53] to worship him they're supposed to know
[39:55] him his first message was what repent
[39:59] why cook the kingdom of God is at hand
[40:03] that was his first coming now what about
[40:05] his second coming
[40:07] I believe the message is saying the same
[40:09] thing repent why because the kingdom of
[40:12] heaven where is at hand
[40:15] man see you can't change the message the
[40:17] message is the same rhyme God came the
[40:19] first time in the first coming preaching
[40:21] repentance
[40:22] amen at the second coming he's preaching
[40:24] the same thing repentance get right with
[40:27] God before it's too late
[40:29] get right make sure you all you write
[40:32] with God don't just come to church
[40:34] Amendment make sure you're right
[40:37] Jesus came preaching repented to those
[40:39] Jews because you know what they wasn't
[40:40] right
[40:42] very religious though come on somebody
[40:45] very religious most religious people
[40:47] upon the face of the Earth but they
[40:49] needed repentance
[40:51] they need to repent why because it
[40:53] wasn't right there they were worshiping
[40:54] God Jesus Jesus said that they worship
[40:57] Him in vain
[40:59] because they were teaching for Doctrine
[41:01] the Commandments of men
[41:04] Jesus in vain you do worship me
[41:07] because they were teaching for doctrines
[41:09] to commandment of man so they worship
[41:10] wasn't even right in the sight of God
[41:13] what they was doing wasn't even right in
[41:16] the sight of God that was like Jesus
[41:17] came he came saying repent
[41:21] and people don't like to hear that word
[41:23] because a lot of people when you're
[41:24] telling repent the first thing with us
[41:27] they want to say I ain't did nothing
[41:30] I didn't do anything wrong what'd I do
[41:32] no you need to examine yourself amen
[41:34] praise God and see if he is doing
[41:36] something wrong no matter what it is
[41:37] Lord I want to repent
[41:40] I I want to come to repentance because I
[41:43] want my running to be invented I want to
[41:45] come to repentance amen amen and I want
[41:48] my repentance to be genuine
[41:51] a lot of people say to repent but
[41:52] there's no change
[41:54] John the Baptist can't preach and
[41:56] repentance he was the Forerunner of
[41:57] Christ he can't preach and repentance he
[42:00] said repent also know what you said
[42:02] bring forth fruits and meat for repent
[42:04] let me see something to show me that you
[42:06] repent
[42:07] let me see some fruit that you repent
[42:09] don't tell me you repent as doing the
[42:12] same thing let me see some fruits
[42:14] that you truly repented let me see you
[42:17] make a turn from what you're doing and
[42:19] do something else do something new do
[42:20] something God's way
[42:21] amen so John the Baptist came preaching
[42:24] repentance also
[42:27] he came with the baptism of repentance
[42:29] for that age to get the people ready to
[42:31] receive the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[42:33] right
[42:34] John was the first Forerunner of Christ
[42:36] he can't preach and repentance to that
[42:39] age getting the people ready for the
[42:41] Lord Jesus Christ to come
[42:44] amen hallelujah amen if God has done the
[42:47] same thing said a prophet amen sins and
[42:50] repent because the kingdom of God is in
[42:52] hand repent because the Lord is soon to
[42:55] come repent
[42:56] get ready to meet the Lord
[42:59] don't keep on doing the same things
[43:01] you're doing amen repent and get serious
[43:03] with God
[43:04] amen so as a call to repentance and I
[43:08] saw it and I just called a man the Lord

[44:47] bring you to repentance
[44:49] it'll cause you to repent when you got
[44:51] some love in your heart but if you don't

[45:25] of uh of saying that you are very sorry
[45:30] for something bad that you have done
[45:35] and that hurts sometimes but I'll tell
[45:36] you it's sometimes if you're not really
[45:38] humble it's hard to say that you're
[45:41] wrong because most of us want to be
[45:42] right
[45:43] it's hard sometimes to commit around the
[45:46] husband to the wife he got to confess he
[45:48] wrong sometime the wife got to confess
[45:50] to the husband I'm wrong sometime amen
[45:53] see but when you always want to be right
[45:55] you never can't say you're wrong you
[45:56] can't repent
[45:58] you can't paint from your wrong but you
[45:59] got to repent this morning amen amen

[46:18] God lord I repent for another anger to
[46:20] try to take control of me to make me say
[46:22] and do things are not right you need to
[46:24] repent from that anger this morning
[46:26] that I ain't gonna get there again and
[46:29] grab controlling you and begin to make
[46:31] you say things and do things that's not
[46:33] right
[46:35] you need to repent but not not just say

[46:43] inside your soul
[46:45] see repent from your anger
[46:48] there will do a lot of things to make us
[46:50] angry in the natural that we're going to
[46:52] have the spirit of Christ in you that
[46:54] today ain't going to overcome you you
[46:55] got to overcome the anger that's right

[46:59] to come and get inside us and get
[47:01] advantage of us
[47:03] it may get abandoned to make us so angry
[47:05] that we say wrong things say wrong
[47:07] things to the children
[47:08] say wrong things to the wife say Rob
[47:11] think you're the husband why I was angry
[47:15] I was mad
[47:17] you need to repent this morning from
[47:19] your angry and you're mad
[47:21] don't let it rule your life
[47:23] don't you think you need to repent this
[47:25] morning
[47:26] yeah you need to ask God to forgive you
[47:29] amen you can't go to heaven like that
[47:31] now you got to get rid of your anger
[47:32] before you get to God's kingdom you got
[47:33] to get rid of it
[47:35] you can't go on God's kingdom with no
[47:36] anger anger angry ain't getting in God's
[47:38] Kingdom
[47:39] amen amen now we got to repent of it is
[47:42] not a part of a Christian nature to get
[47:44] angry
[47:45] amen it's not a part of a Christian
[47:47] nature to get angry to Christian nature
[47:49] to say father forgive them they don't
[47:51] know what they do
[47:53] hitting on a part of a Christian to get
[47:55] angry
[47:56] they better take wrong than to get angry

[48:06] Lord there will try to get you angry to
[48:09] get your soul lost

[48:14] the Devil anyway he got mad because God
[48:16] was greater than him he wanted to be
[48:17] better than God
[48:18] and he got angry
[48:20] and rebelled against God
[48:23] yeah that would have started from all
[48:24] that stuff come from the Devil so he got
[48:27] angry because he wasn't being worshiped
[48:30] so he he got angry he didn't want to be
[48:32] in worship so he started fighting
[48:34] against God
[48:35] even got the angels to turn against God
[48:36] the Bible says he drew a third of the
[48:38] angels with them all because he got
[48:39] angry
[48:40] came down now he hates God
[48:42] knowing that he hate God he hates God's
[48:44] children come on somebody the devil
[48:46] don't love you he's angry with you
[48:48] mad with you because you're saved
[48:51] Hallelujah he don't like you but he
[48:53] won't save that same anger Us in him and
[48:55] he want to put it inside you
[48:58] don't you let the devil do you like that
[48:59] the Bible you're not ain't gonna hit his
[49:01] device if we didn't want no Angry Spirit

[52:35] Repent no he want to see genuine
[52:37] repentance
[52:39] with some fruits Amen in it amen good
[52:43] works Fallen Emmanuel repentance amen
[52:45] look at an example let's go to the book
[52:47] of Psalm 51. we talk about this all the
[52:50] time amen but we're going to read a
[52:52] little bit this morning by the grace of
[52:53] God Psalm 51
[52:57] Hallelujah
[53:03] you all know the story of David
[53:05] but here David also this morning is a
[53:08] good example of what repentance amen
[53:11] here go a good example of a real
[53:14] repentance
[53:15] he did wrong everybody know David did
[53:18] wrong y'all know the story of David
[53:21] how you took killed that man took that
[53:23] man's wife and all that bad stuff that
[53:25] he did
[53:27] he thought he got away
[53:29] but then God said who Nathan the prophet
[53:32] to remind him of his sin you know God is
[53:35] only about the mercy of God that God
[53:37] don't send somebody in your mind you
[53:38] your sin
[53:40] see God can call us out anytime you want
[53:42] to
[53:42] there's only the mercy of God remember
[53:44] that now if you don't press anything
[53:45] upon you this morning I want you to know
[53:47] about the grace of God remember this
[53:49] that God can call our sins out
[53:53] if he still choose to do so
[53:56] now the Bible said uh the chastening of
[53:59] the Lord is good for you you need to be
[54:01] chanced by the law so when God don't
[54:03] call it our sins is for our own benefit
[54:08] David thought he had got away how many
[54:10] y'all with me this morning
[54:12] did not David thought he had got away
[54:14] he thought he got away
[54:16] but it was the mercy of God that came
[54:19] and exposed his sin
[54:22] so you won't never want to sin and think
[54:24] you get away with it because you're not
[54:25] going to get away
[54:27] you need God to expose you now before
[54:29] it's too late
[54:31] you don't want it to go on like it
[54:32] nothing happened he said oh I got away
[54:34] nobody no but God does know now
[54:36] and God can't expose your sin and only
[54:39] the mercy of God that he does so thank
[54:41] God if my sins get exposed
[54:44] amen or it might look shameful it might
[54:46] look bad but it's Gonna Save My Soul
[54:49] see it's going to save your soul when
[54:51] God exposes you usually want to know you
[54:54] know who don't want to be exposed
[54:57] the Devil he's the only one that don't
[54:59] want to be exposed
[55:00] did y'all hear that
[55:02] the devil does not want to be exposed
[55:05] because when you're exposed the devil we
[55:07] can cast him out
[55:09] we can defeat him that's right
[55:11] so when you're covering hide your sins
[55:13] amen that means you're acting just like
[55:15] the devil
[55:16] see so thank God when he come and expose
[55:19] our sins so David's sin got exposed
[55:23] thou like the man come on somebody
[55:26] they're all like the man you the man
[55:27] that should die but here David in the
[55:29] book of Psalm begin to cry out to God
[55:33] a real repentance have mercy on me o God
[55:36] according to a loving kindness according
[55:37] to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies
[55:39] and blot out my transgressions
[55:42] brought up my wrong doing that I did
[55:44] Wash Me thoroughly for my iniquity and
[55:47] cleanse me from my sin oh he's crying
[55:49] out now he's confessing that thing in it
[55:51] confessing that wrong doing why he wants
[55:54] some repentance
[55:55] amen you want God to forgive him
[55:57] amen if I acknowledge my transgressions
[56:00] and my sin is ever before me see you got
[56:04] the knowledge of Ron doing you can't
[56:05] keep on doing wrong expect you're gonna
[56:08] get away with it see David did thought
[56:10] he got away
[56:11] he thought nobody else knew to accept
[56:13] the people that was privy with him and
[56:14] had them that help him deal with his sin
[56:17] he had different people helping him in
[56:19] his sin and he thought he's going to get
[56:21] away but thank God for Nathan God sent
[56:22] and Nathan the prophet Amen to get him
[56:25] straight
[56:26] see and now he comes to repentance
[56:29] amen he's repenting before God
[56:31] amen trying to get it right now before
[56:33] it's too late and God did forgive David
[56:36] his sin
[56:37] because I put away thy transcribe put
[56:40] away thy sin and may God forgave David
[56:43] David came to repentance and God forgave
[56:45] him see that's what God wants to do this
[56:47] morning amen God just want you to come
[56:49] to repentance for you to forgive you
[56:51] amen amen you can move on with the Lord
[56:54] so you don't don't stand don't confess
[56:56] it don't confess it and and let God
[56:58] forgive you amen be sincere about it cry
[57:01] if he got you I'm y'all we ain't crying
[57:03] in a long time you know I love that
[57:05] Mercy one time we used to cry you don't
[57:07] see too many crying no more people don't
[57:10] cry like to use
[57:16] with all sins but Iran's doing we don't
[57:18] see much of that no more
[57:19] hey man people just come to church you
[57:21] know thank God for that don't get me
[57:22] wrong thank God for that but it's a call
[57:24] to repentance we need to get right with
[57:26] God
[57:27] we need to do better than what we're
[57:29] doing
[57:30] praise God we need to amen so that
[57:32] repentance is important because it's a
[57:33] part of our Christian journey I mean the
[57:36] part of a man being a Christian amen is
[57:39] coming to repentance amen praise God
[57:41] look at another scripture I got them
[57:42] written all over the place there by the
[57:44] grace of God Amen let's go to the book
[57:45] of mouth first Peter
[57:48] amen praise God
[57:55] so David repented thank God he repented
[57:58] you know some people in the Bible read
[58:00] about didn't repent we're gonna read
[58:01] those to you so some people they're not
[58:03] going to repent
[58:07] they they won't repent though they hear
[58:09] the truth and Noah's right they still
[58:11] won't repent and we're gonna read that
[58:13] to you by the grace of God so you don't
[58:14] want to be in that state
[58:16] that you heard the truth but you don't
[58:19] want to repent don't be in that state
[58:20] because the people in that state they
[58:23] were like they wind up in a worse state
[58:26] see when God has exposed you that when
[58:29] the time you need to come to repentance
[58:30] right there see a lot of people they
[58:32] don't want knowledge that they need to
[58:34] repent so that they end up in worse
[58:36] shape than what they were before the uh
[58:39] that the word came see so you don't be
[58:41] in that stage you want to acknowledge
[58:42] your sin before the Lord realize amen
[58:45] that you need to repent amen amen what I
[58:47] said I said uh Peter first Peter 3.
[58:56] they might say first Peter remember uh
[58:59] II Peter excuse me
[59:01] I might get my scriptures wrong
[59:29] amen second Peter 3 and 9.
[59:33] so the Lord is not slack concerning his
[59:35] promises some men count slackness but
[59:38] his long-suffering to us Ward not
[59:40] willing to any what Perry but all
[59:43] should come to what repent at all now
[59:45] God long suffering
[59:47] some people get that confused
[59:50] go along suffering and really he ain't
[59:52] did nothing he'd punished you you know
[59:54] uh chastising you that's called long
[59:57] suffering he's giving you a chance to
[59:58] repent amen
[1:00:00] so I would say the Bible said not
[1:00:02] wondering any Superior the
[1:00:03] long-suffering of God he deals along
[1:00:06] with us God be Islam Without Even in our
[1:00:08] wrongdoing God Bears long with us why
[1:00:10] you think you're being so long with us
[1:00:12] give us a chance to repent yeah
[1:00:14] because there ain't nothing gonna happen
[1:00:15] to me everything's gonna be going smooth
[1:00:17] you're like always go smooth
[1:00:18] everything's gonna be all right ain't
[1:00:20] not gonna happen God's long suffering
[1:00:23] just waiting for you to do what come to
[1:00:26] repentance but one day the long
[1:00:27] suffering is going to run out
[1:00:29] see his long suffering he don't want
[1:00:31] anybody to perish God don't want nobody
[1:00:33] to be lost
[1:00:35] the devil wants you to be lost but not
[1:00:37] God God wants you to be saved amen but
[1:00:39] God so loved the world to give with only
[1:00:41] begotten the sons will believe in him
[1:00:42] should not pray but have what
[1:00:43] everlasting life God but the devil wants
[1:00:45] you to go to hell God wants you to go to
[1:00:47] heaven God wants you to be saved in
[1:00:49] order to be saved you must come to
[1:00:51] repentance God in this long suffering
[1:00:54] will wait long for us to get right
[1:00:58] here we're long on us to get right
[1:01:00] because he's not wanting us to perish
[1:01:02] but he's going to make us get right you
[1:01:04] got to want to get right
[1:01:06] you got to want to come to repentance
[1:01:09] Hallelujah when you hear the word of God
[1:01:11] that's God calling you you ought to want
[1:01:13] to come to repentance
[1:01:15] for God long-suffering will run out
[1:01:19] see his long-suffering amen amen is

[1:04:46] late he sold the law for 30 pieces of
[1:04:48] silver sold him out amen he cast it down
[1:04:51] you know what Judah went and did
[1:04:54] he wouldn't hung himself
[1:04:57] see
[1:04:58] all because he waited too late to come
[1:05:01] to repentance
[1:05:03] he waited too late
[1:05:05] to make it right
[1:05:07] really too late
[1:05:08] to do the right thing he waited too late

[1:05:30] to repent but couldn't
[1:05:33] did y'all hear that
[1:05:34] he wanted to repent but couldn't
[1:05:38] you don't want to be in that ship this
[1:05:40] morning
[1:05:41] you want to come to repent of what God
[1:05:42] is calling
[1:05:44] you want to come when he's calling to
[1:05:46] repent and look at another one by the
[1:05:47] grace of God they go to the book of
[1:05:49] Hebrews how many I remember the story
[1:05:50] Esau
[1:05:52] Hallelujah
[1:05:54] praise God
[1:06:00] Hebrews 12.
[1:06:02] foreign
[1:06:05] 16.
[1:06:09] so unless there be any foreign pregnant
[1:06:12] Esau who for one muscle of meat sold her
[1:06:15] Birthright and no Esau did he's uh when
[1:06:18] you read the story of that what he did
[1:06:20] it don't look so bad how many I ever
[1:06:22] read that story it's all good for me to
[1:06:24] read this
[1:06:32] the birthright is the most important
[1:06:34] thing during that age and it still is
[1:06:36] doing neighbor we don't do Birthright
[1:06:38] like that like they did it back then the
[1:06:40] the birthright is that the firstborn
[1:06:42] gets everything
[1:06:44] are the Lion's Share of everything and
[1:06:47] that was a great thing because that why
[1:06:49] that's why Jacob wanted it so bad
[1:06:51] wanted that Birthright real bad
[1:06:54] see and that why he uh he did what he
[1:06:56] did to Esau but Esau shouldn't have did
[1:06:59] that he should never sell his Birthright
[1:07:00] you know what your breast write this
[1:07:02] this morning what's your birth right
[1:07:03] this morning it's the Holy Ghost
[1:07:06] don't sell it out
[1:07:08] for the devil for a little bit of
[1:07:09] pleasure of the world don't sell your
[1:07:11] breath right out to the devil for the
[1:07:12] page of this world
[1:07:14] don't sell out here get you to sell it
[1:07:16] out now he'll get you to sell out God
[1:07:18] for what a little bit of muscle I mean a
[1:07:20] little bit of fun a little bit of
[1:07:22] deliver that don't you sell it out this
[1:07:23] morning
[1:07:24] I mean he saw after he sold his breath
[1:07:27] right you know what he wanted
[1:07:31] it was too late
[1:07:32] he done so now and Jacob wasn't going to
[1:07:34] give it back
[1:07:35] because Jacob wanted that breath right
[1:07:37] that's right come here he wanted that
[1:07:39] Breath Right he wanted a band that way
[1:07:41] he did what he did to his brother
[1:07:43] because he wanted that Breath Right
[1:07:45] see he wanted it back and only did Jacob
[1:07:47] get his breath right
[1:07:48] but Jacob also got his Blessing
[1:07:51] who gave it to him God did how did God
[1:07:54] give it to him through his mother
[1:07:56] come on somebody
[1:07:58] God uses mother
[1:07:59] to give him that give to give him amen
[1:08:02] the the uh the inherent the blessing put
[1:08:06] him in Esau by birth
[1:08:08] Allah by birth
[1:08:10] but God all of us got to take none of
[1:08:12] the Bible said then God said Esau uh
[1:08:15] Jacob have a love but he's all happy
[1:08:16] about what
[1:08:17] do you think God hated Esau
[1:08:19] because he thought was evil
[1:08:22] Esau never repented
[1:08:24] he did things on purpose to aggravate
[1:08:27] his mama and his daddy
[1:08:30] how many you ever read that in the Bible
[1:08:32] the Bible said because he know a
[1:08:34] displeasant mom and dad as you marry
[1:08:36] those worldly girls he wanted to marry
[1:08:38] them anyway
[1:08:39] yeah what Esau did see he did things
[1:08:41] intentionally to upset his parents
[1:08:44] he was wicked
[1:08:46] hoping you got no children like that
[1:08:47] this morning don't you you doing things
[1:08:49] intentionally to upset your parents you
[1:08:51] know your parents don't like you doing
[1:08:52] certain things you said you're gonna do
[1:08:54] it anyway
[1:08:56] but that's the way children are on this
[1:08:57] last day they do do what they want to do
[1:09:00] ain't children delinquency apparent
[1:09:02] delinquency we don't we don't do the rod
[1:09:04] enough
[1:09:07] we don't do the router now
[1:09:10] we we coming up we know about that
[1:09:13] about getting beatens your children this
[1:09:15] generation here you don't get beaten
[1:09:17] like we did they might get a yell at
[1:09:19] their parents didn't save a cuss at
[1:09:22] but no beating
[1:09:24] see we raise up in a generation Our
[1:09:26] Generation we got whipping for what we
[1:09:28] did
[1:09:28] but now in this generation children do
[1:09:30] anything say anything do we beat them
[1:09:32] like we supposed to no
[1:09:35] well watch out now you better go like
[1:09:37] God words say you spit around you
[1:09:40] spoiled a child you might might grow up
[1:09:41] to be a monster
[1:09:43] you don't want a monster on your hand
[1:09:45] you say why you say a monster by the
[1:09:46] given because children get out of
[1:09:47] control
[1:09:48] money got out of control was hard to
[1:09:50] contain them
[1:09:52] so you better contain them while you got
[1:09:54] a chance
[1:09:55] why you got them you had to contain them
[1:09:57] because once he got out of control
[1:09:59] they're out of control
[1:10:01] I'm gonna go and sit therefore they end
[1:10:03] up in jail they end up on drugs they end
[1:10:05] up in the street because when you had
[1:10:07] the opportunity to contain them and
[1:10:08] bring them into subjection you didn't do
[1:10:10] what the word of God said you let them
[1:10:11] go and do what they want to do say what
[1:10:12] they want to say and they're out of
[1:10:14] control now
[1:10:16] now you can't do nothing with them what
[1:10:18] you gonna do now you better stop praying
[1:10:20] better repent tell Lord I messed up come
[1:10:23] on somebody Lord I messed up Lord
[1:10:25] forgive me I didn't whip that child and
[1:10:28] do that child like I was opposed to Lord
[1:10:30] I'm sorry
[1:10:32] you think people gonna do that today no
[1:10:33] they think everything all right that's
[1:10:34] my child
[1:10:36] do what they want to do my child
[1:10:38] cutting them back to school that's my
[1:10:40] child they bet don't say nothing to my
[1:10:41] child child being bad kick out of school
[1:10:43] getting suspended that's my child
[1:10:47] all right
[1:10:49] you better get them under control though
[1:10:51] if it was too late
[1:10:53] why do we say all that because of Esau
[1:10:57] Esau
[1:10:59] did everything he could to Vex his
[1:11:02] parents
[1:11:04] that's why God said Jacob have I loved
[1:11:07] and he thought how about what I hate it
[1:11:10] God hated Esau because of what his ways
[1:11:14] what he was doing
[1:11:15] parent children obey your parents in the
[1:11:18] law for this is what this is right
[1:11:21] see obey your parent not only in the law
[1:11:23] but they ain't saying well babe too
[1:11:25] that's what you're supposed to do amen
[1:11:26] so Esau amen soul is birthright
[1:11:30] Disobedience to his parents and you know
[1:11:33] what he wanted he wanted repentance he
[1:11:35] wanted uh to come and get the blessing
[1:11:38] back he wanted but listen to the 17th
[1:11:40] verse for you know the how that
[1:11:42] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:11:44] the blessing he was rejected for he
[1:11:48] found no place of repentance though he
[1:11:50] started carefully with tears
[1:11:53] too late he cried and y'all read the
[1:11:56] Bible he cried before my father my
[1:11:58] father after I only
[1:12:03] cried
[1:12:04] but no repent he couldn't change that
[1:12:06] blessing that's already gave me Jacob
[1:12:07] Jacob said I blessed him and he will be
[1:12:10] blessed I have blessed them and he shall
[1:12:12] be blessed see can't take it back
[1:12:16] Esau
[1:12:17] couldn't find no repentance
[1:12:20] why he shouldn't have sold his breath
[1:12:22] right from the beginning
[1:12:25] he should not have sold it that was
[1:12:28] precious it still is don't say your
[1:12:30] Birthright
[1:12:31] don't sell out the Holy Ghost don't sell
[1:12:34] out God for a little bit of pleasure of
[1:12:36] the world
[1:12:37] you won't find repentance
[1:12:39] you're gonna find no place to repentance
[1:12:41] that's also in the book of Hebrews amen
[1:12:42] how there's no place of repentance
[1:12:45] amen let's read that real quick by the
[1:12:47] grace of God Hebrews the sixth chapter

[1:13:18] of the Heavenly gift and we may partake
[1:13:20] of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the
[1:13:22] good word of God and the powers of the
[1:13:25] world have come if they shall fall away
[1:13:27] to renew them again to repentance seeing
[1:13:30] they're crucified to themselves the Son
[1:13:32] of God afresh and have put them to an
[1:13:34] open shame
[1:13:35] don't sell your Birthright

[1:15:34] the
[1:15:35] uh Jezebel and y'all know a story
[1:15:38] Jezebel they have that's right
[1:15:40] did him on repent
[1:15:43] they knew Elijah was the prophet that
[1:15:45] age it still wouldn't come to repentance
[1:15:47] those two Jezebel and they have let's go
[1:15:50] to Revelation revelation 2.
[1:15:54] y'all know the story of Jezebel and they
[1:15:57] have
[1:15:59] they didn't want to repent and all that
[1:16:01] wickedness they've been doing you know
[1:16:02] what God is long-suffering giving chance

[1:16:20] himself a prophet that you're teaching
[1:16:21] introduce myself to commit fornication
[1:16:23] these things sacrificing the idol now
[1:16:25] let's do Testament Jezebel doing the
[1:16:27] same thing the Old Testament Jezebel did
[1:16:29] that's right
[1:16:30] she seduced God's uh servant to commit
[1:16:33] foreign
[1:16:38] I gave us spirits to repent of a
[1:16:41] fornication and what God said she
[1:16:43] repenteth not
[1:16:44] so God give us all space to repent no
[1:16:46] matter how Wicked you might be God
[1:16:48] always leave us space in there for you
[1:16:49] to repent you just got to walk in it

[1:17:05] shut off the word of the Lord y'all know
[1:17:07] how Wicked they were
[1:17:08] they're very Wicked people but God

[1:17:14] speech to repent here now in the last
[1:17:17] days the same Spirits are going on the
[1:17:19] spirit Spirit of Jezebel amen is coming
[1:17:21] and got the people messed up again and
[1:17:23] God gave our spirits to repent but she

[1:17:27] to people there's a lot of people who
[1:17:28] won't repent they won't come to
[1:17:30] repentance but God is calling this
[1:17:32] morning so jhab and Jezebel refused to
[1:17:34] repent refuse to
[1:17:37] make it right before God goes God said
[1:17:39] be whoever cast into a bed and then
[1:17:40] commit a doctor within the great tribal
[1:17:42] agency set to repent of their deeds and
