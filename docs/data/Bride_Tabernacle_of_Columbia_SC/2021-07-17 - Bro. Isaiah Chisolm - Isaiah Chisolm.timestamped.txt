[46:42] a royal lion now he's not a lion but
[46:45] he's similar to

[47:43] he said for we rats are not against what
[47:46] flesh
[47:47] and blood it's not your brother it's not
[47:48] your sister but we are wrestling
[47:50] against flesh and blood
[47:54] but against principalities against power
[47:57] against the rulers of darkness
[48:00] of this world against spiritual
[48:03] wickedness
[48:04] and high places wherefore take unto you
[48:07] the whole
[48:08] armor of god that you may be able
[48:12] to withstand in the evil
[48:15] day and haven't done all to stand
[48:19] stand there for having your lawns girl

[50:51] able to stand
[50:53] against the wild the trickery of the
[50:55] devil

[51:00] paul told us brothers and sisters he
[51:02] spoke to
[51:03] the church he says uh be strong
[51:07] in the lord so that's the first thing
[51:09] you need to be strong

[51:14] where in the lord and in the power of
[51:17] not your might
[51:18] amen but his might that's why paul
[51:21] said that we should lean to our own
[51:24] understanding that's what he said but he
[51:27] said in all
[51:28] our ways we shall what acknowledge him
[51:31] and he shall direct thy path i thank god
[51:35] amen for the armor amen in this last day
[51:38] so when we put on the armor of god
[51:41] paul said put on the whole armor just
[51:44] don't put on
[51:46] the shoes amen and you don't have on the
[51:48] helmet
[51:49] we're living in a time brother and
[51:50] sister we're we're in a serious
[51:53] seriously spiritual warfare
[51:57] and we realize that we're not wrestling
[52:00] with our
[52:00] precious brothers and sisters because we
[52:03] all
[52:04] is in this together amen we got to fight
[52:06] the good fight of faith
[52:08] and lay hold on eternal life amen i
[52:11] reminded when paul
[52:12] said many will run the race but only one
[52:14] would get the price amen
[52:16] i don't know about you tonight amen i
[52:18] got one thing on my mind
[52:20] i want to receive that trophy man it's
[52:23] no matter what somebody says about me
[52:25] it doesn't matter anymore i just want to
[52:27] get on the other side man
[52:29] i just want to have on the whole arm of
[52:32] god
[52:32] that i'll be able to stand against the
[52:35] wow
[52:36] and the trickery of the devil let me
[52:38] just read something here
[52:40] amen by the help of the lord for we just
[52:42] get carried away here by the heavenly
[52:44] lord
[52:45] the prophet of god says in the message
[52:47] in 1962 he's
[52:49] nine army when it's ready an army a
[52:52] nation is making ready to go against
[52:55] another another nation it shall first
[52:57] set down
[52:59] and figure what what's right and wrong
[53:02] and whether they'll be able to go
[53:04] against
[53:05] a nation a next nation or not
[53:08] jesus taught that and if people will
[53:12] do that if nations will sit down
[53:16] and stripe and think those things both
[53:19] sides
[53:20] we wouldn't have no war can the church
[53:23] say man
[53:24] and the prophet of god spoke on this
[53:26] general
[53:27] custody a man uh he was told not to
[53:31] go to this particular war but he took it
[53:33] with on
[53:34] he took it on himself and he went on to
[53:37] fight
[53:38] in this war amen and end up losing
[53:41] his life so we're living in a time now
[53:45] we have to put on the whole armor of god
[53:50] even when you come to church you got to
[53:52] have on the whole armor
[53:53] even when you lie down at night you got
[53:56] to have on the whole armor
[53:57] i remember about a week a few weeks ago
[54:00] brother simmers
[54:01] i was leaving got up 12 o'clock in the
[54:03] morning to go to work
[54:04] i got about living on the outside and
[54:07] leaving my wife
[54:08] a man in the kitchen and i walked on the
[54:10] on the porch and
[54:12] and in my spirit i could feel amen
[54:15] the gross darkness has covered the earth
[54:18] brother and sister
[54:19] we are living in a dark time we are
[54:22] living in a cold cold time
[54:25] and i'm reminded that our prophet told
[54:27] us in the church age
[54:29] he told us to guard ourselves towards
[54:32] what
[54:32] the last day spirit all lay out a seal
[54:36] he said so many are getting so cold
[54:39] because they haven't realized the effect
[54:43] of the last day spirit brother i will
[54:45] ask people all around
[54:47] how many you know we're living in the
[54:48] last day oh yes brother children
[54:50] certainly we're living in the last day
[54:52] well you know
[54:53] in the last day all the spirit people
[54:55] knows that
[54:56] but they don't know the effect of the
[54:58] last day
[54:59] and that's why you got to put on the
[55:01] hormone because the spirit of laodicea
[55:04] is so cold it's so formal amen
[55:08] we live it at a time now uh folks don't
[55:11] even
[55:11] love to go to church anymore you know uh
[55:15] and i don't understand you know and you
[55:17] know we are facing this thing together
[55:20] i remember when covet 19 saw it in that
[55:22] was one of the most
[55:24] miserable time of my life in this
[55:26] christian walk
[55:27] when we had to stay home and and listen
[55:30] that sermon
[55:32] uh sitting on the couch uh uh uh
[55:35] somebody
[55:35] drinking lemonade listening out a sermon
[55:39] but you know i got sick and tired of
[55:40] that some laying on a laser boy lying
[55:43] back
[55:43] listening at a sermon on a laser boy and
[55:46] some just going to sleep but you know
[55:48] what i did amen
[55:49] as soon as hey man they say we could get
[55:51] out brother i got out
[55:53] and i went down to the building got
[55:55] things together i said man i want to be
[55:57] in church
[55:57] amen i want to be in a place where i can
[56:00] worship god
[56:01] i want to be in a place where i can
[56:02] worship him and

[56:44] children of israel

[1:11:00] brother brandon talk about this lady uh
[1:11:03] she had to go to the clinic and she had
[1:11:06] cancer
[1:11:06] on the breast that's right and say it
[1:11:09] was real
[1:11:10] it was real messy real real you know it
[1:11:13] was
[1:11:14] terrible to work with and she would go
[1:11:16] to this clinic
[1:11:17] and if this clinic said this daughter
[1:11:19] said no no i don't want nothing to do
[1:11:21] with that
[1:11:21] so she'll go to this doctor and his
[1:11:23] daughter said no that's too messy
[1:11:25] i don't want nothing to do with that oh
[1:11:27] you're hearing me good so
[1:11:28] after a while this doctor say okay i
[1:11:31] would take the case
[1:11:32] but this mother's sitting there with
[1:11:34] blood everywhere
[1:11:35] and in the cancer all y'all hear me go
[1:11:37] the cancer ain't always through a breath
[1:11:40] in her ribs are you hearing me don't
[1:11:42] tell me jesus christ
[1:11:44] ain't the same yesterday today and
[1:11:46] forever are you hearing me
[1:11:48] and when they looked at her she had
[1:11:50] napkins at the napkins
[1:11:52] and blood amen and the and the nurse
[1:11:55] began to look at the case she walked
[1:11:58] over brother simmer
[1:11:59] and got all of her instruments and tools
[1:12:02] and things
[1:12:03] and her husband asked say can i just
[1:12:06] pray
[1:12:07] well the doctor didn't too much want him
[1:12:08] in there he said well i guess
[1:12:10] you could mine yourself and stay over
[1:12:12] there and he prayed
[1:12:13] and said when he prayed it said a
[1:12:15] rumbling noise
[1:12:17] folks don't believe those kinds of
[1:12:18] things happen anymore they think it just
[1:12:20] happened in the prophet day
[1:12:21] but let me tell you what jesus christ
[1:12:23] it's insane yesterday
[1:12:25] today and forever he was praying
[1:12:29] and all of a sudden they heard a rumbly
[1:12:31] noise came through that hospital
[1:12:34] and the nurse walked over and when she
[1:12:36] walked over
[1:12:37] she looked she moved the napkin and she
[1:12:40] moved another napkin
[1:12:42] and said where is that one moment she
[1:12:45] saw it

[1:12:48] gone

[1:18:30] what the joy of the lord is my strength
[1:18:32] somebody said brother children why are
[1:18:34] you so happy why i'm so happy
[1:18:36] i saw my name in the line book of life
[1:18:39] by revelation
[1:18:42] whoo god almighty
[1:18:45] the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:18:47] beast of the field
[1:18:49] and god told her nah nah nah nah
[1:18:52] now if you notice in 1962 brother
[1:18:55] browner
[1:18:55] he talked uh uh he talked on the uh
[1:18:59] the greatest battle ever fought he he
[1:19:02] talked on the uh
[1:19:03] uh what's the word uh the three
[1:19:05] triumphant
[1:19:07] and we know his body spirit and his soul
[1:19:10] now if you notice a man in 1962
[1:19:13] brother brown taught the body and he
[1:19:16] taught the inside
[1:19:17] with the soul and that's what he said
[1:19:19] then he went to the interim
[1:19:21] he said that was his spirit but after
[1:19:23] the opening of the seals
[1:19:24] when the mighty angel came and gave him
[1:19:27] a bella see brother brown had a
[1:19:28] progressive ministry
[1:19:30] oh you hear me that's all right i'm
[1:19:32] saying that brother samuel you see some
[1:19:34] people think
[1:19:34] that he was jesus christ no he was a man
[1:19:37] just like
[1:19:37] you and i paul was a man just like you
[1:19:40] and i
[1:19:41] so brother brownlee got a good
[1:19:42] revelation and he came back
[1:19:44] and he preached on do you have that give
[1:19:46] me ten minutes brother said we can
[1:19:48] do you have that up there the three
[1:19:50] realms of the spirit praise god
[1:19:52] oh praise god there you go praise god
[1:19:54] praise god
[1:19:55] and i'm not going to hold you alone my i
[1:19:57] can see it praise god
[1:19:58] amen and you see
[1:20:01] we are three triumphant i know we all
[1:20:03] know that right but it's good to talk
[1:20:05] about those things is that's right
[1:20:07] and we are what we are body we are
[1:20:09] spirit and we are soul
[1:20:10] that's the out of man that's right and
[1:20:13] god gave us
[1:20:14] five outlets are you hearing me
[1:20:17] god give us five outlets so we could
[1:20:20] contact
[1:20:20] the thing around us but the same way
[1:20:23] would i be out of order if i get down
[1:20:24] there
[1:20:25] hallelujah praise god i i'm sorry i'm at
[1:20:28] i'm at daddy's house amen
[1:20:29] and i just feel good i'm just gonna be
[1:20:31] at home amen
[1:20:33] so we realize we are made out of body
[1:20:36] spirit and soul every one of us
[1:20:38] we are body spirit and soul and god gave
[1:20:40] us
[1:20:41] five outlets to contact the things
[1:20:43] around us
[1:20:44] amen i'll see you could hear me
[1:20:47] you could feel your face you can hear
[1:20:50] god gave you the old eye list
[1:20:52] the contact the things around you but in
[1:20:54] the inside
[1:20:56] it's a spirit that's right it's your
[1:20:58] memory
[1:20:59] your affection your conscience
[1:21:03] i'm not going to get with all those but
[1:21:05] i just want to deal with
[1:21:07] one in particular and that's
[1:21:10] reasoning that's in the spirit reasoning
[1:21:13] and that's what the devil wants us to do

[1:36:49] god we
[1:36:50] thank the lord for them coming by us
[1:36:54] tonight
[1:36:56] while he was up speaking i thought about
[1:36:59] he was wasn't married very long maybe a
[1:37:02] few years
[1:37:03] and i thought about the time he came by
[1:37:05] the house i think i was able to stand
[1:37:07] with a brother named brother hicks
[1:37:10] and he came by he was working
[1:37:12] construction
[1:37:14] and he had a a hernia on his side
[1:37:19] and it was about the size of um orange
[1:37:22] or maybe a grapefruit
[1:37:24] and he pulled his shirt up and i knew he
[1:37:27] had a family and i knew he had to take
[1:37:29] care of the family
[1:37:30] time was a little hard back then
[1:37:33] i looked at it and i thought about the
[1:37:35] family
[1:37:37] and we prayed a simple prayer and we
[1:37:40] looked back
[1:37:42] and it was gone
[1:37:45] i said when he was up here i don't know
[1:37:47] something said
[1:37:49] say something about that i don't know
[1:37:52] and that's just to see god be god amen
[1:37:58] so many wonderful things so many
[1:38:00] testimonies then
[1:38:02] we can share how god done so many
[1:38:05] miracles so many
[1:38:06] supernatural things i remember when
[1:38:09] god was just bringing us into the word
[1:38:12] of the hour and
[1:38:15] there wasn't i remember sister gloria
[1:38:17] you said eloise those and
[1:38:18] power god was so great
[1:38:22] and they was excited because they saw
[1:38:24] the pill of fire
[1:38:27] and then one of the brothers that's been
[1:38:30] in the
[1:38:31] word for a while extra
[1:38:34] sister gloria what color was the light
[1:38:38] was it blue and then she was describing
[1:38:40] it
[1:38:41] and he knew it was the blue light it was
[1:38:45] the devil
[1:38:47] so that's why you had those blue lights
[1:38:50] in the gloves
[1:38:52] but she was selling about an amber color
[1:38:54] and so forth
[1:38:55] and she was all in the spirit telling it
[1:38:58] and i was just
[1:39:00] smiling because you know we're just
[1:39:02] coming into the revelation of the word
[1:39:05] and god was vindicating the word with
[1:39:07] pillars of fire and supernatural
[1:39:09] signs and oneness and the people
[1:39:12] were trying to get us off track trying
[1:39:16] to say that
