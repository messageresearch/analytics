God that are sick tonight remember our pastor Lord strengthen them and keep them oh God In The Name of Jesus Christ Lord have your will in your way tonight and bless Thy word father in Jesus name we pray amen and amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen you have your Bibles turned with me to the Book of Matthew the 22nd chapter Matthew 22 . and let's start at 34 through 40. Matthew 22 34. through 40. but when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second light until it thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law in the prophets let us pray father we thank you God for your word tonight we ask you God to bless it in Jesus name amen have you seated I want to read another scripture you'll be seated and we'll come back here to Matthew uh go with me if you will to the book of um First Corinthians and I want to kind of just get this in before I go past it we were kind of using this back the other night in Marion and I just felt to let us share a little bit of it here by God's grace uh First Corinthians 13. 3-8 never go back to Matthew 22. third verse Matthew excuse me First Corinthians 13 and 3. and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profited me nothing charity suffereth long in his kind charity intervieweth not charity borneth not itself is not puff up doeth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thank no evil Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth all things believeth all things hope all things endureth all things charity never failing but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there'll be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away amen let's go back to the Book of Matthew 20 22 I kind of want to use for a little thought tonight and something that we was kind of working with the other night at Marion and I entitled it A Love Affair a love of fear I like the way that Jesus described this and we know the different type of Love Philo in our God play and no matter who you meet these days if you ask people do they love God they say I love God well we know Jesus said if you love me then you'll keep my Commandments another place Jesus was telling the people because and I think very much parallel to this generation he said you love me with your mouth but your heart is far from me and that is so true in this hour especially when it comes to the religious Realm uh because everybody just believed because they know that they ought to love everybody but to really possess it is another thing uh because God love is not partial I like your highest describe it there you know First Corinthians 13 He said God love charity is it envious it's long it's enduring see uh it's not something you put on today and then tomorrow is gone like a many even I've been saying the other night you know that uh because we know that the word love is has been expressed uh in our terminology that you know that we love you we love you we love you but I believe the love that God really is talking about and it's something even when the prophet of God went over the other side he said nothing going to enter there but perfect love he didn't say none of the Mysteries he said number to deeply but he said nothing but perfect love we're into there it's not your knowledge are your gifts no matter how much money you give to the church give your body to be burned he said if charity no dare it Prophet should nothing so above anything that you can give or do which is good to do those things I believe out of the abundance of your heart if it's real love you will do these things but then because we're living in the end of impersonation and people can impersonate that they do this or to do that you see what I do but yet in the heart they can still not have the love of God there could people do things uh because of a reason I wrote down something I say you know uh fetal love is a flesh they love and that love we do things for people because of because you my cousin because you were this because but God love doesn't in spite of in spite of what we did God yet gave his life for us in spite of what we were and and how we were living yet God knew and his love was so genuine that he wasn't worried about what state we were in he had a bigger picture so he gave his life the Bible said for God so loved the world when he gave his life not just uh 20 uh 20 or whatever no before the foundation of the world the whole act God did it was because of the love that he had for us because we were lost we've lost total Fellowship we were uh away from God no way back but God grace in Mercy Made A Way to reconcile us back to him again that's why I'm understanding uh you know I thought that the servant of God said he said you know we ought to be the most happiest people there is on the Earth why but because of of of what he did for us and what it cost him he did it something that no other man would do and can do and you know he didn't send Angel to do it he came himself wrapped in a body to walk on the earth in the flesh to be tilted to be hated to be spit on to be ridiculed to be talked about to be called a devil oh my God and we worry sometimes that our little like persecution and we can't hardly take it but he took it and he didn't have to but because of the love that he had even for his own enemies but his Pharisee the religious people came to him tempted him you know just uh see what he gonna say to try to catch him in some type of a commandment you know that wasn't written but I like the way Jesus always referred them back to the scripture and they said what is the greatest commandment you know I thought about I said you know he could have said a lot of things are concerning the law and uh you know the the Commandments and all but he said the greatest of all he said the love the Lord God with all thy heart all thy mind see in other words to give God every fiber of you that's what he did you know parallel he was saying Ephesians and I'm not going to turn down five he said husband love your wife as Christ loved the church that this is a great mystery but I'm speaking unto the church so God is expecting the church his church now to be wrapped up in a love that's unconditional regardless of what goes on or regardless of what happens tomorrow I'll be with Paul saying what shall separate us from the love of God what will separate you from the love of God she had trials to persecution he said name all these things we're more than conquerors see love love conquers every situation if we really understood it and why things are gone along with to happen I was saying so many times that everything that I'm learning and I'm I'm reflecting back on things in my life that I'm seeing now coming back over a lot of things that I dealt with and had uh went through in life and I look at it now and I said you know God was using this just to prepare you just to prepare you for what he really wants you to do everything that happens in our life there's a purpose see we look at all they do no no no no no no I'll be I heard somebody saying God even gotten the devil working for you what is he doing he is bringing you to a place of perfection he's building a character now a Godly character how does he do it through suffering and that's something we don't like to do suffer we want to be always on the Mountaintop the sister and brother there's some days you're going to be in the valley but even in the valley you can still see God I like that's on this thing sometimes then he could have Let Me Drown yes sir he he can let us just you know but no God that's why I said is uh God knows exactly how big brother said he put no more on you than you can bear I know we think we can't have a bell and sometimes those things be really strenuous but we did at those times we must trust that God got it all under control how we don't know but God I'm going to trust them that God sees everything every move that we make he knows everything that's going on in our life even right now but God said do you trust me in other words do you believe that I just didn't save you the illusion I believe one place the scripture is said that I have engraved you in the palm of my hand amen you in the palm of God Hand and the devil can't do you no harm but the children to sing that song Amen yes he got you in the palm of his hand and you might wonder and you might fret but let me tell you something God is in through with us yet but I understand this that what are the reasons that people uh get discouraged and about what's going on in their life uh and they make uh bad choices of this um not want to serve God on anymore a day uh feel that God did them wrong it's because they did love for God Isn't in the right place I type it out a lot of times that man never really love his wife he don't want to do nothing to just please her other herder he understand that the vows that they made was to death do they part and one of the reason that they're vile they begin to repeat those vows do you Jeremiah take this woman then they go over there saying for health of sickness for better or worse for richer are poor see their stipulation and letting us know you're gonna have these times that they will get a little rough but if it's real love you begin to bind yourself closer to more the little spats and a little disagreements you know just the other day you know I've had our 33rd anniversary uh whatnot you know you look back over the years and look back from where you started from where you at now and I can also see it with a true heart you know I love her more now than I did back then because you don't grow and went through some times that where you understand no matter what you went through you stayed together it takes a coward to run out but it takes two people that really love God they're going to trust God regardless of regardless of how it is I'm going to stay under the blood of the children I'm going to stay under the love and protection of God see but too many times many people will run away I believe it was said in the uh uh in the church ages the Ephesus it says that uh one of the complaints about them that they left their first love what was their first love it was the word it was God first I believe that's what what I would first think we started out on fire you man couldn't wait as David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord we were glad to be able to be one in the number one more time we went down when I messed up because we scared that that is something God was going to do Supernatural fire in the love of God that was burning in our hearts you couldn't keep you from the Church of God but after a while things happen I believe Paul said wouldn't believe he said you did run well but what hindia and the servant of God said what happened what he said the cares of this life begin to choke the love of God out of us the cares of this world begin to give us a more materialistic things that we can gain amen and before we know it it happened to all of us but little by little it crept in now we got much much much much much more than we ever had our whole life but look at them spiritual um can't even hardly get a prayer through hard to get their people everywhere it's hard to get the people back you know to the place that where they love God more than they love anything brother you have the the big bucks on a fine cars or the fine house it doesn't matter because you understand those things are temporal don't get me wrong I believe it God bless you thank God for it and I believe you do right by God God will bless you but I'm not so hyped up on me because what I got here I need something up there I mean brother Jared made that song you know how I want to go down there I want to go up here he's still working on that record I believe his first song he made I don't want to go down there but I why because a little boy he knew there was something up there see now he probably can look at it and say Lord have mercy I got to go up there now because down here enough but chaos look what we got to do and look what we got to deal with every day of our life there's a battle the battle going on the demon power is a pressing us attacking our mind sucking the very life of God out of us making us get too comfortable here and making us think God don't care anymore I mean the Bible said what a place that because the Lord the lady is coming old thing continue as they were people now going backwards you know oh it's been a long time you know some even doubting whether the Lord is going to come in other words they'll die I say dollar because then let me tell you something if we really believe and understood you know or that is later that we think we be packing up ready to get out of here we'll be doing everything right now I could do I know how to do Lord I want to be ready I read the Bible saying Revelation said that his bride had made herself ready in other words each and every one of us you got to make yourself High by the word the very purpose God sent us this word in this hour was to give us the thing to prepare us for his second coming amen the word of God prepare us is coming I like it too because I thought about you know of many of the things that Jesus could have said to them you know in other words what will be the greatest thing in this hour what is what would be the greatest commandment of this hour what would be the main screen line of of uh us preparing ourself you know for God in this hour I'll be the servant of God so one of the initiative evidence of the Holy Ghost that is love event I want to read something another scripture find it Matthew 5. the love of God should have brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost I'm in Real Love Now not this stuff that people talking about um I love you today but come Monday I ain't like you anymore you know or we love people one of the saddest one of the saddest things that I've seen in lately is that uh people have this thing that they only love them those that in their Church they can't love outside the owner can love amongst these walls they can't love nobody out there because they ain't like us what does that does that mean like you you know in other words that uh as long as you're with me I love you but if you decided to go somewhere else and then I don't love you like that because you ain't identified with us come on is that what Jesus did I believe he went outside his box he went even out sometime he had to even send his own disciples somewhere else to go talk to this lady who had five husbands because they wouldn't understood the love that he had for the lowest of the lowest sea he never tried Somebody went to the news the church folks they just heard about Jesus but he went to know them without oh without the message of the hour he went to those who didn't even know nothing about um a prophetic Ministry if you know he went he went to them in that state and he wanted to try to help them to lift them up what did he presented to them he gave them the word because he was a Living Word see he knew what he had he knew what they needed and the people needed the word of God to get him out of this condition and that's what it gonna take Sinister it's not the Deep things that we're trying to get the people to see give him Jesus and he is the word amen but we're trying to be mystified you know we're trying to be intellectual Giants and we missing the little sheeps and the little lambs oh yeah we're getting the up any luck but we missing the real sheep see because Jesus said my sheep will hear my voice in a stranger they don't want to hear they won't hear so he's looking for sheeps it seems are vulnerable they did they have to have a leader they're easily to be persuaded without a shepherd that's why Jesus Christ is the bishop and The Shepherd of our soul it can't be that uh I believe you know that God uses vessels to deal with people but it's not so much the main figure it's the spirit of God in him and he understand that it takes a wise man to win souls see one planet one water God give the increase the people you may be talking to right now may not come but if they are predestined to see the god they'll fell up somewhere down the line I believe that you all know that we're really gleaning the fields now very hard very difficult very in a religious country as we're living in that everybody now got it and they just satisfied that I have arrived we have around that and even sometime even amongst people because they've heard a cried because they have heard to come out of her my people they can get satisfied but let me tell you something until Jesus come don't you get satisfied you can never get all that God has for you because there's just so much that God wants to bring to us I believe I like that story he said Falling In Love With Jesus it's the best thing I ever did falling in love again that's what I believe not following you well someone with the trip because it it's going to take the love of God to keep us in this hour because we're going to face obstacles you're gonna face some hardships and some hard things but yet and all of that Lord I know you love me you better understand everything now but something you understand it better by and by when the morning come let's go to Matthew 5. 43-46. he said you have heard that it has been said thou shall love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good instead of rain on the just and on the unjust but if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same in other words you know he said you know we love them that do good to us and we want to get do something good for them but how about the one that don't like you the one that despitefully talk about you scandalize you do you love them see it's easy to love them they love you and sometimes the one we think love us don't love us they love what you can do for them or what they can get from you see what the love you in spite of what you're dealing with are going through my love hasn't changed that's real love what makes a man want to run out on his wife his love isn't right his love is not for in his heart he don't really love her because he love her like God wants her to you want to do nothing to hurt your wife and the church won't do nothing to hurt God don't worry about hurting the church but you're sitting against God you don't want to bring no bad reproach upon the word because you love him see it I I love him that much the Lord whatever I need to do even I make a mistake Lord let me get it right see if love is corrective if you don't like to be corrected then you don't love the person you let those children do anything let everybody do anything it's all right no Your Love ain't right for that child so to have to correct the children they don't like you sometimes but they're understanding and it did me good look back in the days what we thought was hard no it might be even hard but what the world got out there oh my Lord let me tell you something the devil's not playing and he don't patch you either but I've been about to say the way of a transgressor is hard they always say if you make your bed harder you're gonna have to lay in it and there are some things that I've done in my life I wish I never would have did but because of not listening properly I had to suffer and it leaves some imprint on you to the rest of your life you always look about I wish I would I wish but that's water in the bridge what I'm gonna do with it now I'm gonna use it as a stuffing store I'm gonna learn from that and I'm going to tell my children I'm gonna tell somebody else don't go that way see your children young people the reason why we are telling you these things now because we know what road the devil has for you we'd have been down there and done those things it hasn't changed just a different little format you know now it does become a little more uh educational a way of doing the same evil putting good labels on evil doings of down there saying Tower letting the child uh decide what gender they are ain't that sick let them decide I also said the proof isn't important the evidence is they're already down you can say this and say that oh no no no you can't change that I don't care what you say happen oh I didn't mind this didn't happen that didn't happen still yet the proof the proof is right there can't be denied no matter what you say out of your mouth God didn't make no mistake when he made you he made you just like he made you you are what you are by the grace of God I don't care what Futures didn't maybe develop part and all of that that's all right you steal what what made you from the very beginning he made Adam and Eve he separated them he gave them a certain agenda in their bodies they were built a certain way they cannot erase that they couldn't change that but you see with the education of these trying to change the whole thing have a surgery to remove this and remove that oh my perversion see that's what the devil do but Jesus said he said uh you heard eye for eye in other words you do it to me I'ma Do it to you in other words I'm gonna get even with you no we don't do that as Christian but the love of God got to be like if you don't have it you'll be doing the eye for eye you know we do it in a little slick way you know very subtle not so much out out but cunningly to get them back but no leave that to God you just love them he said what this world really looking for is the love of God okay everybody just stay in love with their mouth everybody know them know it go beyond that I believe love has actions you know it's like uh people can love God on Sunday about Monday the love God gone ourselves in the barbershop then you are terribly upset but when you can get it you all cheers I believe this regardless of what we have to deal with and it's better said than done because we all have to deal with things in this life and sometimes it gets real home and God's going to allow it to come home to you because we got to be tried on what we say we got you're going to be proven to be one in a million oh you can't say no so I'm one in a million but we go to sleep could the testing time is going to come oh to all of us none of us can escape it that's why now we really need to get grounded and rooted in the love of God you know don't love people because if somebody else don't love them vice versa groups you know sometimes wanna you know don't love this one but love that one and that's partiality God in like that and you give to the door that can give back give them somebody that can't give back oh I ain't giving them I don't give them so much now they're like that's true but how do you know God in testing you I didn't say give him everything but you're gonna have some wisdom with because all the time it's not the material things you know I'm learning something this you can if if any parent just want to buy these children everything but I'm you trying to party love you can't buy they love see you got to show yourself respect but and they can feel that you love them or if you get the all these A's and nothing wrong with AIDS shall I like yeah that's good but they're still your child I'm learning parenting you have some children to do this to do that but regardless of at the end of it they steal your child and regardless of some of us that went way out the way but we still was God's child and God knew what it takes to reel us back why your love must be long sometime years one of the things I learned so much about the Simmons taught the word and talked to me a lot of times about a lot of things down and I've been wondering why he's telling me this and but now I see the Lord have mercy do I see now and let me tell you something you don't know what God's preparing you for something everyone already every one of it there's something God got for you to do I tell people back home God ain't never save us for nothing why would God save nothing to do nothing but God got something for you to do it maybe a one person you might have one person God wants you just to witness to one person something it's not your talking it's your living the best sermon we can preach mother Ernest is a life live before the people you are the best Thunder sermon let the love of God shed abroad in your heart just flow through you you'll bring more souls to the kingdom because believe it or not they're watching you you don't even think so even your enemy that one that cut up on the job that you and give you a hard time they're watching you as soon as you got to see me they'll say hey I thought you say you was a Christian you'll say it about us you know but but I understand that it's gonna take a revelation for us to understand that you tell but deep the love of God is deep and it's rich and it's powerful God no no gift no Dynamic message is greater no tongues no interpretation no prophecy but he said love all of these other gifts need to be surrounded with love to be effective that's why I enjoy listening to the spirit of God because he could go down on any any level and and reconcile the people no matter what they were in you know a lot of times he's talking to a woman preacher and he says sister you said you said a long call you he says go do what the Lord tell you to do wow we wouldn't do that in this the hill would we we're going to rebuke them sharply all right he dealt with all kind of people we have to learn we're gonna have to deal with all [Music] not say you're compromised but you just share the goodness of God let God do the drawing see you gotta get all that there you know sixth Dimension and all of this right here no just just come to the basic bring them to Jesus and close it on this brother Ernest testimony on the sea he said we're on a great tantrum a great dress tantrum is just like in fashion like the world he said love not the world nor the things of the world if you do the love of God is not even in you he said I don't care how much you speak in tongue jump up and down dance cut hair wear dresses like that your man you man permitted your own fruits tell where you were at that's exactly right no wonder we're in such a chaos as we are in The Winds of the Communists in The Winds of this catechism in the world of economical organization he says because of we love the world more we love God God is looking for a church that is so out completely to him how do we get there God fill us with your love real love that's not partial love that's not picky love that not um you know sideway but genuine love for even my enemies because they hate you you don't have to have the same Spirit they have show love toward them and keep showing love toward them it takes God to do that God bless you tonight brother Ernest [Applause] how many enjoy the word tonight amen the love of God Amen I was thinking about when he was ministering tonight I was sharing with some people some testimonies of my life and the mindset that I used to have before the Lord saved me but in all that I was thinking I said but nevertheless God loved me in spite of all of that and all that I was sharing with the boys you could you couldn't even believe it who not not earnest but we all born in sin we all came in this world with a certain mind frame but through election God knew that one day we hear his voice so I said even in all of what I was dealing with him and doing going through I said God loved me in spite of all that you know Satan the devil accused you and all that but his love he loves you in spite of all that because he knew that one day you'd come to him so I was thinking about that you know tonight and I says you know if God can love us in spite of how much more we can love one another I was sharing with him at work as some people across the street homeless one time I said you know because they was making some remarks I said but my heart won't let me say those certain things I said because I realized the condition I was in the only reason why I ain't over there homeless is because of the grace of God the only reason why I ain't over there and ain't over here is because that's just the way God God this was the Lord's doing not none of mine so you look at yourself I says that how can you can't look down on nobody how can you look down on somebody because God didn't look down on you did he he looked down and uncovered you uncovered your life it'd have been bad wouldn't it he just pulled a cut the light on just to show those dark those dark spots that nobody didn't know you had in your life those things in your in your spirit that's all messed up God cut the light on there and exposed it right but he don't do that he loved you in spite of y'all y'all thank God tonight amen let us stand amen appreciate the word amen I was just thinking about that though tonight I says God thank you because you love me in spite of spite of me amen well as I was just a pan sing that sing a little bit of that song um Falling In Love With Jesus you know what sing a little bit of
