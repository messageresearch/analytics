[41:43] which was a figure for the time then
[41:48] present in which were offered both gifts
[41:52] and sacrifices that could not make him
[41:56] that did the service perfect as
[41:58] pertaining to the conscious ten
[42:10] but Christ's been come and high Priests
[42:14] of good things to come by a greater and
[42:18] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[42:21] hand that is to say not of this building
[42:25] 12.
[42:37] for if the blood bulls and goats and the
[42:42] ashes of the help of spranking the
[42:44] unclean
[42:45] Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh
[42:49] 14.
[43:01] together for this cause he is the
[43:05] mediator of the New Testament that by
[43:08] means of death for the Redemption of the
[43:11] transgressions that were under the first
[43:13] testament they which are called might
[43:17] receive the promise of Eternal
[43:19] inheritance
[43:21] God bless you towards you may be seated
[43:25] there's power in the blood or the power
[43:29] of the blood of Jesus Amen
[43:32] that's Power in the Blood amen
[43:37] it's probably too loud a little time
[43:39] there's power in the blood amen
[43:43] so we thank God this morning because
[43:46] you know I I just praying and just
[43:49] brought tears to my eyes that
[43:52] there's so many things I said the
[43:54] prophet of God said we can bring the
[43:56] people to the church and we can bring
[43:58] them to a system or Wicked but he said
[44:01] I'm afraid that the people are not being
[44:03] bought to Jesus Christ
[44:06] and you know sometimes we bring them to
[44:08] the message we bring them to the church
[44:09] we bring them to that but the people are
[44:12] not being bought to Christ
[44:14] and um the reason why because there's
[44:17] only way one way we could be bought to
[44:19] Christ
[44:20] amen he said in Romans 5 by one man sent
[44:24] in it in the world and by one man amen
[44:29] God made a way that we can be come back
[44:32] to God and that's the man Jesus Christ
[44:36] do one man sin and do one man die
[44:39] God made a way that you you and I could
[44:42] come back
[44:43] be reconciled back to God
[44:47] if by
[44:52] one man can condemnation set in
[44:57] then one man is the free gift
[45:01] amen and that's the gift of eternal life
[45:05] and he talks about any in Eternal in the
[45:09] 15th verse he said the promise of an
[45:12] eternal inheritance
[45:15] that really struck me amen the Eternal
[45:19] inheritance
[45:21] and he said we have Redemption
[45:24] amen
[45:28] we have been redeemed
[45:31] so let me just I I was all excited I've
[45:34] been excited about
[45:37] the blood of Jesus Christ and been
[45:39] excited about
[45:40] because we we make the blood Sometimes
[45:43] some not effect because we esteem other
[45:47] things greater than the blood of Jesus
[45:50] and not seeing the pathway in which amen
[45:55] Jesus came to the Earth to make a way
[45:59] that we can get back to God
[46:03] and all in types and shadows that was
[46:06] showing from the beginning
[46:08] amen that through the blood of bulls and
[46:11] goats and Ash over the half heifer and
[46:13] the Tabernacle itself was saying this is
[46:16] the way back to God
[46:19] but in that Tabernacle that Moses built
[46:24] and it had you know
[46:26] the ark and so forth and different
[46:28] things that was in there the furnitures
[46:31] and all it was showing us the pathway
[46:36] and we know that through justification
[46:38] sanctification and the baptism of the
[46:40] Holy Ghost it was showing typing out
[46:44] but
[46:46] seeing that it took a blood sacrifice at
[46:48] the altar altar
[46:51] without the blood sacrifice that even
[46:54] God was not real please
[46:57] and when the high priest went into the
[46:59] holy of Holiness once a year into that
[47:02] Tabernacle he couldn't go in there
[47:04] without blood
[47:06] but he had to offer for himself and for
[47:09] the sins of the people
[47:11] he had to offer blood
[47:14] sacrifice of a lamb and that lamb had to
[47:17] be without spot
[47:20] oh
[47:22] it could not be or lane or whatever
[47:25] Hawk
[47:27] it had to be without spot it had to be
[47:29] perfect
[47:32] are you with me
[47:34] and it was for their sins
[47:38] to be covered
[47:40] but the conscious
[47:43] was still there the conscience of sin it
[47:46] could not take that nature away
[47:50] they still had the same desires
[47:55] they couldn't say well you know but I I
[47:57] don't I I don't desire that no more
[48:01] they were just covering in me
[48:04] it discovered the sins
[48:06] couldn't take away sins
[48:09] the conscious still was he still felt
[48:12] condemned
[48:15] unconscious
[48:17] still felt like a sinner
[48:21] and because you felt like a sinner in
[48:23] your conscience and you know some folks
[48:25] because they don't recognize what the
[48:27] blood of Jesus Christ has done a lot of
[48:29] folks come to church and and it's
[48:32] supposed to be Christians but they
[48:33] they're walking around in condemnation
[48:37] they feel condemned they're conscience
[48:41] because the devil is already always
[48:43] bringing out what you're doing
[48:47] and seemeth though people are not able
[48:51] to grasp their Deliverance
[48:54] they're not able to comprehend what the
[48:58] blood has achieved and accomplished for
[49:00] them
[49:02] so them not really recognizing the power
[49:06] of the blood
[49:09] and what Jesus died and what he did in
[49:13] that he died it wasn't just that he died
[49:16] it was the power
[49:19] in which God Amen the power of that
[49:23] blood the power of the death of Jesus
[49:27] Christ it was so powerful
[49:32] it did something
[49:35] not only did it do something about our
[49:38] sins but it did something amen about the
[49:42] conscience that we had
[49:44] the desire to sin when we could not
[49:47] overcome things
[49:53] see because we had to face the fight
[49:56] that do I come to church and do I feel
[49:59] like I'm a part of Brian Tabernacle of
[50:01] this church at that church have we come
[50:04] to uh recognize the power of the blood
[50:09] and what the blood has achieved and
[50:12] accomplished for you and I
[50:16] and sometimes I feel like we haven't
[50:19] fully uh comprehended that
[50:23] and because of a lack of understanding
[50:27] the devil will still have you bound
[50:30] twisted up tied up and Tangled Up
[50:34] mixed up in messed up
[50:39] but once you recognize the power of the
[50:44] blood and what the blood has achieved
[50:46] for you
[50:48] things would be different
[50:52] that's why Paul says there is there for
[50:56] now no condemnation to them that are
[51:01] what
[51:02] in Christ Jesus
[51:04] who walked not after the what
[51:08] oh God
[51:10] see you're gonna constantly feel
[51:13] condemned when you do not recognize your
[51:18] Eternal inheritance
[51:21] if you do not recognize the power of the
[51:26] blood and what he achieved and
[51:28] accomplished for you you will still walk
[51:32] with your head down
[51:35] you said I accept that Jesus Christ as
[51:37] my person the Savior yes but you don't
[51:40] really know what accepting Jesus Christ
[51:44] is savior what it really means what it
[51:47] really entails what does it really mean
[51:50] to accept Jesus Christ
[51:54] what is it what does it really mean to
[51:57] confess Jesus Christ with your mouth
[52:00] and believe in your heart that God
[52:02] raised him from the dead if you do not
[52:05] understand the magnitude of what has
[52:09] been achieved for you
[52:12] we merely can go through the motion and
[52:17] not get what we're supposed to get
[52:19] because we don't understand what has
[52:22] really transpired
[52:26] but when we recognize what transpired
[52:29] that day on Calvary
[52:34] praise God
[52:37] let's just go to Acts 2 for a moment uh
[52:41] to
[52:42] and 22.
[52:46] Peter talked about on the day of
[52:48] Pentecost standing up with 11 and

[52:56] was there were misunderst they didn't
[52:59] understand what this Holy Ghost was all
[53:01] about they thought it was new wine
[53:04] they met but Peter standing up says
[53:06] these men are not drunk as you suppose
[53:08] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[53:10] day but this is not which is spoken of
[53:12] by the prophet Joy that in the last days
[53:15] say to God I promise Spirit upon All
[53:18] Flesh

[53:25] a representation
[53:27] amen and it was Amen to signify and to
[53:33] demonstrate and to manifest that what
[53:37] Jesus has accomplished Amen on the cross

[53:45] been Vindicated
[53:47] amen your faith in him has been uh

[1:24:31] little bit of I don't know
[1:24:36] I don't know
[1:24:38] if I I thought
[1:24:41] I thought and it worked for a little
[1:24:43] while but some it didn't seem like it
[1:24:46] did enough for me it's not
[1:24:47] that the blood has lost its power
[1:24:51] it's not that Jesus got weak
[1:24:54] is that the devil started messing with
[1:24:57] your mind and making you up
[1:25:01] isn't that right
[1:25:02] when the devil gets you just to die to
[1:25:05] look what just said what
[1:25:07] just a little bit then he gets you to
[1:25:10] doubt a little bit that he got interest
[1:25:16] you can come in
[1:25:19] then you're back to your old tricks
[1:25:22] doing your old things
[1:25:25] your back line
[1:25:27] you're back fornicating
[1:25:29] you're back doing this and doing that
[1:25:31] why
[1:25:32] because you listen to his life
[1:25:36] isn't that right
[1:25:38] but you got to turn you got to turn
[1:25:39] around
[1:25:40] now let's just go to first John
[1:25:43] and I'm going to close here
[1:25:46] I I thought I was going to close a long
[1:25:48] time ago
[1:25:51] and I was I was already closing
[1:25:54] first John
[1:25:56] one and and six
[1:26:00] y'all all right this morning
[1:26:03] don't you know
[1:26:05] many of you gonna walk out here and
[1:26:07] still said I don't understand no I
[1:26:11] I don't understand
[1:26:15] I don't know how to believe
[1:26:18] the prophet of God said
[1:26:20] the hyssop that they took and put the
[1:26:23] blood on the doorpost in the lent he
[1:26:25] said that meant simple faith
[1:26:28] if you had enough Faith to get out put
[1:26:31] your clothes on this morning that same
[1:26:33] kind of faith
[1:26:35] you apply the blood like that
[1:26:38] it's nothing that you gotta imagine not
[1:26:40] super duper nothing it's just that I
[1:26:43] accepted
[1:26:44] simply are you with me
[1:26:47] I accept what Jesus died for my sins I
[1:26:50] accept that and the simple faith
[1:26:55] it'll work how long
[1:26:58] it has never lost its world
[1:27:01] it would never fail he would never fail
[1:27:04] you
[1:27:05] but the devil's job is to get you to
[1:27:09] doubt
[1:27:10] the power of the blood
[1:27:13] his job is to come to you and tell you
[1:27:18] like he told Lee
[1:27:21] you should not surely die get you to
[1:27:23] doubt what
[1:27:25] Dr word
[1:27:27] and right now he's trying to get you to
[1:27:29] doubt what Jesus died for your sins
[1:27:34] and if you believe that Jesus died for
[1:27:35] your sins then you don't have to be a
[1:27:38] sinner no longer
[1:27:40] are you with me
[1:27:42] but if the devil come and give you that
[1:27:44] little bit of doubt
[1:27:46] then what you do you start acting like a
[1:27:49] sinner
[1:27:50] because you don't believe that Jesus
[1:27:53] died for your sin but if you believe
[1:27:54] that you he died for your sin then
[1:27:57] you're going to accept your forgiveness
[1:27:59] and you're not a sinner anymore what are
[1:28:01] you your son or daughter God
[1:28:04] are you with me
[1:28:05] because you've accepted Jesus Christ
[1:28:08] now you said would that make me uh that
[1:28:11] I won't make mistakes no you you might
[1:28:13] stumble you might fall just like a baby
[1:28:15] crawling a baby crawl get back up but
[1:28:18] that don't take away the fact that you
[1:28:20] still
[1:28:21] a child of God

[1:29:30] have I really for my heart and do I
[1:29:33] really mean I've surrendered my life to
[1:29:35] Jesus do I really affirm that
[1:29:42] sometimes we have to check ourselves
[1:29:45] because God's word can't fail us
[1:29:49] okay I got a first John
[1:29:53] uh one and six
[1:29:56] if we say we have fellowship with him
[1:29:59] and walk in what
[1:30:02] Darkness we were
[1:30:08] are y'all with me
[1:30:10] did Brother Simmons say that
[1:30:12] the Bible said that isn't that right
[1:30:16] and do not the truth
[1:30:18] but if we walk what
[1:30:22] as he's into what
[1:30:25] we have what
[1:30:28] and what
[1:30:34] see what happens the blood cleanses a
[1:30:38] small sin then he says if we what
[1:30:42] if we say we have what
[1:30:45] we deceive our
[1:30:47] cells and what
[1:30:50] but if we what
[1:30:52] if we confess our sins he's what
[1:30:57] into what
[1:31:00] that we say we what
[1:31:05] we make him what
[1:31:07] and his word is what
[1:31:10] but he says in the second uh chapter
[1:31:13] first verse my little children
[1:31:15] are these things right eye unto you that
[1:31:19] you are
[1:31:20] that you sin not
[1:31:23] and if any man what
[1:31:25] he have an advocate with the father
[1:31:27] Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the
[1:31:30] propitiation for our sins and not for
[1:31:32] ours only but
[1:31:35] also for the sins of the world
[1:31:39] amen
[1:31:40] now God don't want you to make mistakes
[1:31:44] but if you do confess your sins for he's
[1:31:48] faithful and just to forgive you
[1:31:50] are you with me
[1:31:52] the blood works it don't matter
[1:31:54] who you are where you are is not the
[1:31:58] church it's the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:32:01] you purchase
[1:32:03] you've been purchased with the precious
[1:32:05] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:32:08] it's not what group of people you with
[1:32:11] is not the man that the prophet that
[1:32:15] died for your sins is not the church
[1:32:18] that did it it's not a group it's Jesus
[1:32:21] Christ he came in the flesh to die and
[1:32:24] take away the sins of the world
[1:32:26] you got to always remember that that's
[1:32:29] where you
[1:32:30] how you come to Christ by accepting the
[1:32:34] blood of Jesus Christ the death of the
[1:32:36] cross
[1:32:37] if you have not come to Jesus Christ
[1:32:39] that way you came another way
[1:32:42] if you not receive the atonement
[1:32:46] we thank God for
[1:32:47] the message we thank God for the prophet
[1:32:50] we thank God for his church but
[1:32:54] you got to come to Christ
[1:32:58] you got to come to Jesus Christ
[1:33:01] go to church assembly it says together
[1:33:05] that's the word
[1:33:07] God sent a prophet that's the word
[1:33:10] are you with me
[1:33:12] there's a message that God has given
[1:33:14] that's the word
[1:33:16] are you with me
[1:33:18] but to get
[1:33:21] your sins forgiven
[1:33:23] you got to come to Jesus Christ
[1:33:26] if you come
[1:33:28] to do all these other things and don't
[1:33:31] come in by the door
[1:33:34] brother and sister that's where the
[1:33:36] failure is
[1:33:38] that's where we make all our mistakes
[1:33:40] that's what we stumble because we never
[1:33:42] we don't have that relationship with
[1:33:44] Jesus Christ
[1:33:46] are you with me
[1:33:48] and sometimes see we can want the church
[1:33:52] to do certain things the preacher to do
[1:33:54] certain things the message but we got to
[1:33:56] know that Jesus Christ has done it all
[1:34:00] everything that we needed done Jesus
[1:34:03] Christ has paid the price for anything
[1:34:06] that we ever could do any mistake
[1:34:09] anything we need Jesus Christ has paid
[1:34:12] the price
[1:34:15] are you with me what he died on the
[1:34:17] cross the price has been paid
