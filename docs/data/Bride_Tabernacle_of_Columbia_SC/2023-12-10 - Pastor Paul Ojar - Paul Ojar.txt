love you so much Lord Lord I love you so much Jesus I love you so much I will never fail you now go God be the glory just my precious sister and my bestest friend here they drove all the way four hours to be with us brother Carl his and her husband we just want to share a short testimony I think it's about 7 years ago I was at my house in Fort Lauderdale and I was walking through the door and I heard a voice saying there there's a number on your telephone go and call it now and I was still walking and the voice said call the number now but I know the voice of the Lord I said yes Lord and I saw the number but it was a strange number because my phone was changed and I didn't know the number so I dialed the number and I said I was asked to call this number and brother car picked up the phone he said sister Hannah sister Hannah I didn't know it was him he said I'm not talking about you here they were in Georgia she and brother Carl were sitting around the table I think breakfast time yeah and they were having breakfast but she was in tears and she was burdened and she was crying and he is telling her I want you to meet this n sister I want you to talk to this n sister and she could pray for you take [Music] yeah so at that time um I was going through a real hard trial um my husband and I my husband had served 23 years in the military and um he had retired and he took it really hard so um we had also been in church most of our adult life um we came into the message we did not grow up in the message but um um we came into the message and my husband I think um we raised our kids in church but I think for the most part he was about 75% committed and then um when he retired from the military it sent him into a crisis um in a lot of ways and then the enemy just came right in and it almost tore our marriage apart and and our marriage was I would say for the most part we probably in the world's eyes had about 1% chance and that morning we had met with um brother Caesar he was trying to help us in every way that he could and we had met um at a restaurant and my husband had gotten so mad that morning he had got up from the table and left and he said said that's it he said I'm done we're through and I was sitting there devastated and brother Caesar started speaking about sister Hannah and I had never met her and he said you have to meet this sister because the Lord is with her and the Lord Works through her and I said because I had nobody in my life but brother Caesar and his wife and I really needed somebody and I was devastated and I said what am I going to do he's gone and I knew when my husband got up from that table I knew he meant what he said he was gone that was it about that time sister Hannah called like Al the blue she said who am I speaking to the Lord just told me to call this number and she said I lost all the phone numbers in my phone and who is this and and brother Caesar just laughed he said we were just speaking about you and um I explained my situation to her and she said well let's just pray and she she started to pray and she said Lord she said I ask you I just a real simple prayer and I forget exactly I can't quote it exactly I said holy spirit go and arrest him wherever he is and bring him back to this table and let them renew their vows like the old time and let them open the gap of communication what they don't have but I never knew that was a problem she just said she needed prayer and so we sat there and then sister Hannah started giving some testimonies about what God had been doing in in her local assembly and so we just sat there and a few minutes later my husband walked back through the door and he looks so defeated and he just sat there and sat down at the table and um sister Hannah kept giving testimonies a few more testimonies and she said well she said I need to go God bless you and she introduced herself to my husband and and that was that and I'm sitting there and I'm just smiling because he didn't know that sister Hannah had prayed for the Holy Spirit to arrest him and bring him back and he was sitting there and he looked a little confused but he said I don't know what happened but he said something just happened and I had to come back [Music] here so so it's been seven years and I have to tell you I have the best marriage my husband is now 100% committed and I have the best friend in the whole wide world that I could ever ask for so God can take a very isolated lonely person who is a living testimony of Grace a broken marriage a broken home and with one simple prayer restore everything yeah thank you God bless you all it's all about Jesus God bless you all amen praise the Lord praise the Lord we're going to have announcements at this time [Music] brother

remain standing just for a little moment I want to turn to the word of God lord richly bless each and every one of you I want to take from the book of St Mark chapter 11 it's a scripture that we're all familiar with Mark 11 and22 we' read on to verse 24 Hallelujah enjoy the testimonies so much please forgive me if I sometimes act like a little baby the Lord means so much to me he's done so much for me I just got to praise him from the depths of my heart amen Mark 11:22 and Jesus answered and said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sath shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever he desire when he pray believe that he receive them and he shall have them amen in Mark chapter 9 I'd read it verse 23 Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth we thank the Lord for his word today amen may he bless it to our hearts you may be seated and thank you very much thank you my brother so happy to see sister Carin amen and a husband brother James my and those from Florida I know you didn't come to hear me right you you wouldn't drive all that way to hear me it course I'm not much of a speaker thank you ver Simmons for being so good to us the last few days ver Simmons has played a special role in my life and in the family amen we know him since we were little kids he's been visiting with daddy and over the years and after Daddy went to be with the Lord that's 30 something years now where Simmons been Like a Rock Amen in our lives and such an encouragement to us a real father to us amen you know after daddy died and I'm I made it a little commitment in my life to be friends with his friends many of them have gone on now to be the Lord but we still got bro Simmons amen I thank the Lord for him and his family his wife and the children we really appreciate all of you amen this church Tabernacle over the years some have gone on since I've first visited and there's many of you all have grown up a little bit now I knew them as just little little ones amen I remember when I'd preached I'd stand at the door at the old church there and they come and say brother Paul I love how you You Preach I try to preach simple break it down to that the little ones with Hest I'm not too intellectual anyway amen I've got a a pretty big Bible I was wondering if to walk with a smaller Bible or my usual this is what I usually use now um you know getting on a little bit in age so you need to see the prince a little bigger so don't don't don't worry too much about it and this is just a little notebook it's just about two or three pages some little notes okay so I'll try not to be too long usually when you come from Trinidad while they're preaching some of the ministers we started around 10:00 10:30 and when it reached 1:00 2:00 they say well we're now moving on to the third poll we got to go an hour again right but I'm not one of d right some Churches they're like services will be about 6 hours so you know I re I guess you know Christians don't die right they sleep so by the 6th hour you're get in that sixth [Laughter] Dimension amen amen I think I'm going to get in trouble when I go back back to turn that I hope this sermon doesn't go around the world Amen the Lord Rich to bless you I've toally enjoyed myself and you know today I trust we'll just let the Holy Spirit have Liberty amen and freedom you know Friday some of you all just held back a little bit yeah especially at the end of the service you should have just let the Lord just flow and and and use you in whatever way and you know because there might be somebody depending on the power of God demonstrated in your life amen that might be the time of their Victory or their breakthrough that they so need and so desire so so don't hold back amen you feel the spirit and the presence among upon you you just let the Lord have his way and flow freely through you all amen that's what we spoke about on Friday amen come to that place where the Holy Spirit Will flow so freely through US amen it won't be us speaking it'll be the holy spirit amen it'll be him moving through you and I well as I told you on Friday I I'm not one very good with um naming a Ser because many of times I start with something I end up somewhere else so my sermon could have lots of names this morning possibly all things are Poss possible or when two omnipotents meet or perfect Faith amen amen but we just want the Lord to have his way amen you know the prophet said that m is omnipotent you believe that yes sir I want to read it to you a little bit amen would that be fine amen we we spoke about being redeemed back to all that Adam had lost and that fellowship and the fellowship that Adam had with God and he he lived in that presence constantly amen and and Adam had power to speak to that tree tree there and it said tree you be taken up and be planted over there it'll go amen it had to obey his word amen well when Adam fell that Fellowship that man had with God was broken but God had an objective behind all of that he had so much attributes within himself that he needed to display if there wasn't someone Fallen how would he we know what Redemption is all about if you're not sick how how are you going to know what it feels like to be really well how do you know something is good unless you ain't got the bad so there's a purpose in it all God had a purpose in it all amen and he wanted to express himself to the fullness amen well he's got a bride in this day and he wants to express himself in the fullness in his bride isn't that the truth amen not just a a a a defeated group of people just amen you know just going along with the flow sometime we feel good sometime we feel bad now that that's we do go through those times right but there's a purpose in it all amen we got mountains we got valleys but there's a purpose behind it all amen hey amen amen well after man had fallen and that connection was broken when the Lord Jesus Christ came He restored back that connection the prophet in the message the patma vision says he said every obstacle from human beings that might be connected like in the Garden of Eden he cut every obstacle amen I said he cut every obstacle so there's nothing to hinder us now from receiving the full blessings of the Lord he says no man I I was going to choke it that mean he was going to hold it back he wasn't going to say it but he he said but I'm going to say it he says man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God so not just a man as I said to you on S on Friday that he's calling us to that place of full surrender we where you know I said we got to be more sincere it's not that you're not sincere but you got to be more sincere now he's calling you to a higher level it's not that you're not a Christian or not a Believer yes you are it's not that you don't have the Holy Ghost you've got it but he wants to bring you now to another level isn't that the truth yes sir he says he says you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did he not say in Mark 11:22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart so it's not just what you say Amen you can't doubt in your heart that's faith without a doubt now amen he says and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you've said what happens when two omnipotents meet when God and man comes together two omnipotents imagine God and a man with perfect faith comes together oh Hallelujah what's going to happen when God comes on the scene and there's a man and with that perfect Faith something's got to take place the miraculous got to take place the supernatural's got to take place it's got to amen whatever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he stands isn't he wonderful that's what you've been restored back to amen now let let me read something to you here again let me see if I find it amen oh my I can't where did I write that down anyway you see I'm not very good at this right I'm depending on him thank you Lord Jesus God in the message fate 1961 God doesn't have little weak spots you know we got some muscles a little bit weaker and some really stronger muscles isn't that the truth you know physical being well God ain't like that little weak spots and a bit stronger heavier stronger spots go and got that he ain't got weak spots and big heavy spots that's powerful the least little touch of God is omnipotent I'm thankful to that so the least little touch you get from God today that's omnipotent come on he's made it so easy for us we just got to accept it we got to believe it accept it and and it come to pass in our lives now sometimes we we want it to take place immediately right but a trial of our faith work at patience we got to have patience amen and let patience have a perfect work in us right amen because God's Building A Perfect Bride bringing it into Perfection we've got to have these things in our lives because character without power without character is satanic you know sometimes the world likes everything the easy way but the Christian don't they know it's the harder way amen because thou has chosen chosen the hard the way which is my way amen well that's what we've done when we've chosen to follow the lord Jesus we've chosen the harder way it's his way we've chosen why did we do it is because of the love of God in our hearts you love him so much because of what he's done for you yeah whatever you ask whatever it is you're just willing amen he doesn't have powerful spots the least touch of God is omnipotent see the least touch of God he say you know I'm trying to get you in fate now you know that something has happened to you as a Christian you we all know something has happened to us as a Christian right do you know the congregation says amen you used to ride down here in the mck with all the mck and sin ining and gambling on things of the world well as soon as you believe that Christ forgave your sins you raised up above that stuff now you're riding up here see above all of it you were down there now you're up here amen now you're writing up here see above all of it why because that you believe that you are a Christian then when you accepted Christ and the Holy Spirit came to you then you have faith in the holy spirit that gives you power to ride above that kind of a life of sin that's why you live the life you live now amen well now the only thing you have to do is ride higher into healing and I'm here to tell you you can you see it's all finished at Calvary now if you come and say brother Paul pray for me that I'll be healed what I'm here to tell you is that it's already done I'm here to just get you to believe that it's already done at Calvary amen you need the Holy Ghost well he already poured it out it's unto you and to your children and to as many as the Lord Our God has called isn't that the truth so you can believe for your children it's already done and I'm here to accept what's already already finished Hallelujah yes sir thank you Jesus whatever you desire amen When you pray believe that you receive and you shall have it it's already finished at Calvary The Works been finished at [Music] Calvary amen amen hallelujah hallelujah you just we just asking Lord raise me up to a little bit higher faith today amen yes sir when I speak about perfect Faith we're asking him to take us up a little bit higher because it's required in this hour yes sir it's required in this hour because it's a perfect bride going to be married to a perfect groom yes it is and it's a perfect place that we're going to so we're being called to Perfection not your Perfection but his Perfection it is in him what he's already done for you and me hallelujah hallelujah why was that early church the way they were because they knew when he walked on the face of the Earth every devil that came against him was already defeated and the only thing that needed to be defeated was death and when they saw him resurrected on the third day Hallelujah then you it was all over now yes the in princible God the all powerful H the almighty Hallelujah that's what I'm here to tell you today it's already over it's finished Hallelujah you're just going to claim it Hallelujah believe it accept it it's over Hallelujah

a moment in the twinkling of an eye yes sir you are that one hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah I ain't here to point you myself I'm pointing you to what you are in the scripture yes sir yes sir I want to read something to you from the revelation of Jesus Christ Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts Amen in the true church we know there a true church and a false church amen well I'm speaking to the true church today I don't spend too much time on that false one anyhow amen amen Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan has Satan been exposed in this day yes sure he has been it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word but he can't do it they Tred to discredit this message but they can't do it to the True Believer to the true church they can't do it it's impossible to do it hallelujah amen hallelujah it exposes Satan amen he fights that yes sir discrediting God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire so he ain't going to stop and you know something as a time his time draws near and he knows his time is Drawing Near you know yes sir so he's going to fight harder than ever before you know he's been fighting a lot but there just seemed to be something just recently just something that seemed like a switch just flicked on in my life yeah yeah amen I said you know I've been living way too below my privileges for far too long excuse me amen amen right down to the time he's cting the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church yes sir he knows that if the people get the Revelation the true Revelation not just the Revelation but the true revelation of the true church and that and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works amen hallelujah woo Glory she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army Hallelujah that's me he's speaking about that's you he's speaking about Hallelujah something got to register deep down in our soul not our mind now no sir this got to register deep down like a as I said seem to be a little switch just flicked on Hallelujah glory to God and I see who I really am you can now get him in the corner and You' see the coward that he really is get your dirty hands off of her Satan get your dirty hands off of him Satan hallelujah hallelujah it's already been purchased for it's finished that word has already gone for it'll never return void amen it's an invincible Army coming forward amen Invincible he means all powerful yeah can never be defeated Oh Glory can never be defeated oh you may get me down now and then but that ain't the real me no sir the real me can never be defeated Hallelujah because I'm part of God even if I'm a tiny piece of him it's omnipotent that's what I'm here to tell you today if you got a little tiny piece of him within you amen hallelujah it's omnipotent hallelujah hallelujah Invincible can never be defeated oh that early church that true church they saw Satan defeated on every ground in every battle they saw Jesus defeated him isn't that the truth yes sir they saw even death defeated because they saw the resurrected Jesus Christ in flesh and then he said you know I got to go away now it needs be I got to go away you see there's more scriptures to be fulfilled woo Glory Hallelujah oh Hallelujah the work ain't done I'm going to do it through you Hallelujah I'm going to do it through you Hallelujah I'm coming back again I'm coming to dwell inside of you you lay your hands upon this sick and they shall recover Hallelujah even it's just a tiny bit of Jesus in me you lay your hand the power is there the almighty all conquering power of God hallelujah wo Glory Hallelujah I feel blessed you know I'm long over you for coming over here yeah Satan tried to stop me just the day when we were coming up little meter fell and burst mouth and lip and so much blood and all these things she wants to go back home I said you know I'm heading back home she told he got me he thought he got me he thought he could rob me of a blessing listen you see but what God has for you it is for you w Glory hallelujah hallelujah amen I know without a doubt sometime I tell him no Bring it on Bring it on there's a time I say oh no again no I said bring it on no I I'm not being stupid right amen but there's something within me no a kind of boldness and a confidence it's not me because if you knew the old Paul BR Simmons near the old Paul the old Paul would have been preaching with his eyes closed yet he can't watch nobody you remember that one and he's worried if he's going to fall over the edge there he's so bashful and shy amen hallelujah amen she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the true the two spirits sorry within the framework of the Christian Church yes within the framework of the Christian church but I told you on Friday Abraham being spiritual could discern lot yes sir yes you discern him and you being spiritual can discern the spirits yes and you withstand the Antichrist spirit and your soul yielded to the true spirit of God to the holy spirit amen by God's spirit look he say discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit not only discern him but you're able to withstand him just as Jesus with stood him because it's Jesus within you now amen now when the battle gets gets a little harder we want to see a little bit of a greater fate now amen it's not the truth well it's there for you actually perfect faith is there for you why would God preach that in this day and that that ain't for you no it's all for me yes sir Fai without a doubt not one word you're going to doubt whatever he says Amen to it isn't that the truth whatever he says to you he says that's yours Amen to it you don't doubt it anymore it's revealed no this is not this is not mind over matter that's the reason why many of people have fallen away you know they tried to figure out all these spiritual things mentally some of them want to see certain Supernatural things they and they try to manufacture things and and and and when they get disappointed they fall away no no no you've learned that it's by his grace it's all by his grace he does anything it's by his grace it's by his mercy and his grace in you and I whatever he wants to do let him do it I'm just a vessel in his hand I'm just y he's God I'm just I'm just a vessel yielded in his hand if he wants to speak through let him speak whatever he wants to do we've got to be so humble now that if you want to just put your as side here for a little while praise the Lord anyhow but you know some of us get disappointed with that no sir when you really love him when I first heard of Jesus amen and what he did for you at Calvary now you love him too much to fail him you he said stand still right there you just stand right there he tells you speak you speak amen Satan let's tell him this Satan will be powerless before her do you believe that's you he's speaking about the bride the true church well tell him you're powerless you're powerless in front of Jesus amen he was the fullness of the word and the word is abiding in me now who am I I'm a of my savior I'm that Revelation for the hour isn't that the truth we're to be that lived voice we to be that scripture being fulfilled in our day there's a portion of the word allotted for you and I but we've got a mighty message in this day yes sir yes sir and it's been Vindicated to be the truth was there a devil could have stood before that man that was so fully surrendered in the hands of God in our day God waved that before us he did it for a reason you know I grew up in a message Dad was a minister first message minister in Pastor in in the island of Trinidad he took the message many of places so I grew up in a m message hearing a message seeing how you live as a message believing person but that ain't going to save me I needed to know something know that I know that I know you know and i' played the message after Daddy had gone and they came out with the CDs and you could play one message after another after the tips you know for I knew it in the times of the big reals like that and then they got the little cassets and then they got the the the CDs so you'd play it all night some I'd fall asleep listening and one night I woke up and I hear that prayer line I just like something struck me that's nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ that's not a man there that's not my the Lord Jesus Christ in not man I'm begin to see that message in a different way now began to feed on this a little differently now then lately it seems as though it's become so new to me I've been in a message all my life but see God's taking us from another stage to another stage higher and higher closer and closer the Rapture is at hand some is beginning to take place and last year you know our little family group we we started studying the Holy Ghost series and after the Holy Ghost series I went onto the adoption series after the adoption series I went onto the church ages I me really studying this and after the church ages did both the church ages the sermons preached and the book amen together doing them together and then I went on to Daniel 70 weeks before Daniel 70 weeks sorry Revelation chapter 4 and 5 I started following you know how the prophet brought deeper truths you know little by little and it's the Holy Spirit was doing that you know in the prophet's life and these things it's for you and I so I want to get all that's for me and then I went on to Daniel 70 weeks and from there did some of those the sermons in 1962 and then I said I'm going on to the Seven Seals amen and just around the turn of the year I started it and and we started the first seal and we were going through one by one and I had a dream somewhere early part of the year I'm fascinated by by the solar system and all these things and I dreamt I had awoken at night and I now not all dreams are of the Lord right but I believe this was of him I dream I went out in the night of this and I looked up in the sky and I can see all the constellations drawn out when I looked up though there was an eagle I was seeing so I said you know when I got up in the morning I said I got to search that message and fin a because I know you know constellation with the eagle in it you know proph spoke about that mother Eagle up there and and I can't remember the exact quat anyway and everything was so real and so clear I began to see all these things and then I saw the moon and the moon was like so close right up I'm like so close to it but there was this great big black thing over it but I'm seeing beyond that and I'm seeing it it's all in its fullness when I awoke I said my you know some dreams when you're awake you feel the presence of the Lord there in that room just around that time briam dreamt he saw me hug the Lord Jesus and when I hugg the Lord Jesus the whole Bible Hallelujah became just open up to me and now as I study I I told you like just something just flicked on I couldn't do it you you thirsted for this all your life you're longed for this all your life it goes beyond intellect we we've understood it mentally the prophet says the greater part of faith we got is mental Faith but it's got to come down here it's got to become a divine revelation spiritual Revelation so when you hear I'm speaking about the omnipotent God it's not up here I'm speaking about I'm speaking about down here I know he's the omnipotent God and not only is he omnipotent but if I let him have his way with me let him have freedom and liberty to flow freely through me I'll see that man fully surrendered to God that omnipotent man you'd see it that that's what I'm here today to challenge your fate now now if you really believe it that Holy Spirit Will anoint that Faith you know yes if you believe it without a doubt because it's faith that pleases him and that's what he's looking for will I find fith when I come without faith it's impossible to please God remember when the prophet had that that experience with the squirrels there was that scripture that he was baffled all about so long and then he went out hunting you see there's a time and a season for everything that's why I believe we're in a special season you know brother Simmons was asking me he said did were you listening to my sermons the last month or so I said no but I think I just flipped through and I saw perfect Faith he was speaking on perfect Faith some time ago but I wasn't listening said man you you you you preached on Friday what I've been saying for the last month or so and I spoke to brother car last night he came over at the hotel to have some fellowship and he said brother he said what you were saying there he knew that's he said that's what God's been calling me to that's what God is calling all of us to it's required of us this bride won't fail I said this bride won't fail there's an anointing in this age that has come Hallelujah to lift you up to a high height we're Eagles friends an anointing has been poured out in this day oh Hallelujah and we got chch an anointed word it's for us to Simply see ourselves day when you really get to know who you really are and it strikes down deep down the the man on the inside that control tower not not the man on the outside the one that really is running the show yeah that one when it strikes deep down in there but you see I believe as a prophet said we got a it's a time for consecration a greater consecration you know I I forgot who you're speaking to and said it's not that he's not going to change the ministry but he's going to change the man for the ministry yeah so I believe there's got to be a change within us yes sir I'm under great expectation friends Hallelujah I know we're in his presence today just let go and let God have a wait don't hold back the Lord wants to use you you let him use you freely let him use you freely he's given you something he wants to use you he wants to do something with you and me yes sir I'm telling you he wants to do something with you and I let them use me freely Lord hallelujah Glory hallelujah hallelujah you can have whatsoever you desire you
