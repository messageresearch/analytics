um what we would call filthy towards almighty god let's put it bluntly but because his grace was an amazing type of grace he was able to push the devil off of your track place each and every one of your sins into what they call the sea of forgetfulness and it doesn't matter what the enemy tries to lay to your charge almighty god has said i've never seen it you've never done it in the first place

god that we serve amen amen appreciate the song leader of the golden age appreciate the musicians this morning hallelujah we're going to look in the book of john this morning go start dave chapter verse amen hallelujah how many trust in god this morning amen man i see brother ernest got one on the drums amen scripture say train up a child hallelujah praise the lord that's good to see put on the word gabe appreciate all of you this morning the gospel of john amen name chapter let's start the 14th verse we're going to skip around a little bit amen there's a lot that he's saying they've been in the eighth chapter of the gospel of john and if you want the background on the story this is when jesus went up to mount olive amen and he was actually in the process of preaching and teaching the people and while he's preaching to the people this is when the pharisees come storming in and they're dragging this woman along with them and said look we caught in the very act of adultery they interrupt the service that lord has gone on and they say you know this is the law of moses what should we do amen they thought they was going to trap him and of course we know the story he said leahy that is without sin let them cast the first stone and the scripture let us know that from the oldest all the way down to the youngest they turned and walked away and after they turned and walked away then all of a sudden jesus christ starts to preach a little bit more because this is an inspiring moment this is an inspiring situation because you see people trying to use the word of god deceitfully and in the 14 verses what jesus said amen he jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whether i go but you cannot tell whence i come and whether i go let's go down to the 23rd verse and he said unto him unto them you are from beneath he already setting up that there's going to be a distinct difference between the two of them you are from beneath i am from above you are of this world i want y'all to read this part with me this morning because this should be your testimony i am not of this world praise god hallelujah let's move over to the 42nd verse amen said unto them if god were your father you would love me if i proceeded forth and came from god neither came out of myself but he sent me how many glad to be sent by almighty god this morning why do you not understand my speech there's a lot of people out there that does not understand the speech almighty god even because you cannot hear my word you of your father the devil that's putting it bluntly and the lusts of your father you would do he was a murderer from the beginning and a bold not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speak of a lie he's speaking from his own for he is a liar and the father of it we're going to turn one most pl spot of scripture in the gospel of john to the 13th chapter third verse i'll just read it to you amen jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from god and he went to god amen we joined a lot of emphasis on where the lord said that he came from in the word the lord said that he was going back to and if we can get you to understand this morning where you came from and what you're going back to where you came from and what you're going back to it's going to even out everything else in the meantime maybe so so our title for this morning just for a few minutes of your time this morning it's going to be i know where i come from amen i know where i come from let's just buy our heads this morning heavenly father in the lovely name of jesus christ lord lord we know no other name that can do the things that you do there's no other name that could be our redeemer there's no other name that could give us strength for we need strength there is no other name lord that can settle us down father god when everything is breaking loose around us lord lord you've been our friend lord you've been our healer lord you've been our redeemer father god lord you've been our comforter lord when we needed confidence we thank you for that father god lord we thank you for the opportunity lord to come out as a body of believers this morning lord despite all that's going on all around us lord you have kept your people lord and you've given us another opportunity father god to lift up the name of jesus christ lord we never take that for granted we never take that lightly lord but we thank you lord lord we ask that lord your spirit will flow through our midst in the lovely name of jesus christ lord that no believer lord will leave this place lord the same way that they came in we think in the mighty name of jesus christ at the saints say amen amen you can be seated this morning hallelujah glory to god amen i used to preach to no quiet church so i i pray that y'all help me preach a little bit this morning but you know it's like to tell the people the ministry we don't come out to do nothing deep for you the only thing we come out to do is show you what the promised book of god has already said about you show you what the promised book of god has already said or what's going to take place in your life remind you who you are remind you of what you mean to almighty god amen and if we remind you of those things that should be able to give you great boldness in the face of the enemy in the sideways man see the word has expressed different things about you and it's expressed different things about your life amen it's shown us that we are different from the rest of the world and sometimes you know there might be a point in time in your life where you shy away from that and shy away of the aspect of being and shy away or the aspect that maybe god has called you to something higher but saints i trust by now that you are able to embrace those things that almighty god has called you to be different that almighty god has separated you amen just like he separated israel from the rest of the heathen nations all around them almighty god has separated out a bride of christ in this hour the bride is placed differently from the rest of the woman amen the bride is placed differently from the rest of the churches out there that's why you call bride tabernacle because jesus christ is your husband and your husband is holding you to a higher standard this morning so we can embrace being different hallelujah glory to god we can embrace having a different set of expectations hallelujah because the expectation for you as a body believer this morning is different from the expectation of the rest of the world amen you can embrace having a different quality because almighty god will have to call you for you to be able to walk in this way almighty god got to call you to it but the sin brother brother simmons he's a very good past amen he preached the word with conviction amen and he could teach that thing to you at the same time but if you just follow along amen because brother simmons said some good words to you amen you're gonna fall short you have to be called to it amen and the call of almighty god is not for everybody hallelujah i'm gonna say it again the calling of almighty god is not for everybody but the bible lets us know he that has a ear let him hear amen what the spirit is saying unto the people of god you know that call and found out to be something separate back in the time of samuel hey samuel was a young man and the bible lets us know he was laying in his bed one night and he kept hearing a voice that was calling his name say samuel samuel you know saying it'll be him being a good young man he get up and come running because the bible lets us know that the word of the lord was precious in those days what it meant was that that god wasn't speaking openly to the people at that point in time through his prophets as he generally did in the times past amen so the word of lord was very precious it was a rare thing so samuel did not recognize at that point in time that that was almighty god speaking to him he thought that was the priest he was with eli speaking to him amen he would go running to the priest i'm here brother amen he said i didn't call you i don't know why you're running to me so sam you go back to bed amen and y'all know the story happened again samuel come running he hear the voice amen and by then he lost us to perceive that it's almighty god calling him amen and his samuel was able to hear a word from almighty god because it was almighty god doing the calling amen and you understand that samuel wasn't just any type of young man coming on the scene but saying it was even born coming out of his mother's womb with a promise and a purpose already over his life when he had him to begin with amen it was certain promises that was promised unto samuel and now he was just stepping into the thing that was already promised for him you being a believer there are certain things that almighty god said about you and said about your life from before the foundation of the world even before you came out of your mother's womb and that's what allowed you to hear the call in the voice of almighty god because he gave you a different set of ears to be able to hear amen at a time where the word of the lord is precious god is allowing some people to fully hear and fully understand where he's going amen and where he's bringing us to him how many of the lord this morning hallelujah you know we talk about being a christian amen you have to understand that a christian is built different ain't no way around it now christian has to be built different christian has to have a different mindset amen i already told you a christian has a different calling and the word christian brother brandon taught us is that that word christian means to be christ-like glory to god because a lot of people talk about jesus and talk about god amen but how many are pushing to be christ-like amen see without calling to be christ-like that is a calling for us to reflect the things and reflect the nature of our heavenly father amen and it's a hot honor amen it's a high privilege for us to be able to to take upon the name of christ to take upon the aspects of being christ-like because a lot of people out there in the world i reflect in a totally opposite nation we read in the scripture this morning to hear jesus christ is on the scene and he wasn't talking to uh uh the drug dealers or the prostitutes the things that nature where he was saying this but he was talking to the pharisees he was talking to the people that that had the letter of the word amen but but their hearts was far from the word amen and what he told these preachers now this is what he telling the preachers that's not what he's telling the dog on the street he told the preachers that you were of your father the devil there were a lot of of hurtful things that you could say that somebody ain't gonna i think i told you before you can call somebody a rat or a car somebody a dog or a snake amen your daddy is no good your daddy is a deadbeat dad but to say that you of your father the devil that's a high-level insult and that's what he was telling the ministry at that point in time but if there was some that were there of that wicked one there had to be some that was made in the very image of god amen there would have to be something that shaped in the very likeness of god i mean there would have to be some amen that have a calling that could reflect that calling amen know exactly who they are where they came from and because they know exactly what they're going back to god called us in that calling amen it's why the brothers act like brothers this morning amen it was good to hear the brothers amen coming up here praying before almighty god this morning amen it caused the sisters to act like sisters and to dress like sisters amen and to wear their hair like sisters amen because you're reflecting that you are different you are reflecting your heavenly father you're reflecting the things that the word of god has told you to do come on now we carry ourselves differently when we go to work okay man hallelujah i hope we do not glory to god if you could tell every joke that everybody else telling amen and everybody else talking about how much alcohol they drunk over the weekend amen you right there with me now now you're not in this separate calling that i'm talking about it man but but hopefully amen somebody at the job can recognize that you conduct yourself differently man you act differently amen hopefully your family members that might not be in the masses they ca they can recognize something different about you amen because what we're doing saints we're representing and showing that we're not from here amen but that we got a different place all together that we are from and almighty god is allowing that to reflect through you as a believer in jesus christ this morning amen let's get the lord some praise hallelujah amen it's a different calling amen you know when others are doubting amen the believer keeps on believing amen when others are doubting that's when you're starting to manifest faith amen when other people are worried and crying and upset about the situation amen you being different you are here to show that god is in control hallelujah amen glory to god if god is in control everything is going to be all right it don't matter if other things and aspects of the situation are looking all out of control if god is in control he's going to see to it that you are taken care of hallelujah when those three hebrew boys got put in the fiery furnace by the king that was supposed to be their friend the average person would have said it looks like things are out of control hallelujah but the bible lets us know that it was a fourth man that showed up in the fight and the fourth man that showed up in the fire showed that he had everything under his control even down to the fire he could change the chemistry of the fire to when they came out not even their clothes had the smell of smoke on it because almighty god had everything under his control hallelujah man when everybody else is getting weak hey man getting weak in faith hey man and people have been out of church so long amen you know the longer you stay home the easier it is to keep staying home amen that's why i'm glad to see you out here this morning everything and if there's something that's out here listen amen and you don't got so comfortable staying home amen sometimes it's trying to come on out to the service again lord is blessed this amen he's kept this amen he gave us some wisdom and some protocols and places and everything has been all right man and the scripture lets us know we don't forsake the assembling of ourselves amen and i ain't afraid to tell you what the bible said this morning hallelujah court of god when people are getting weaker amen we are showing that we are feeding on the word of god and getting stronger in this hour when people can't see past the natural and can't see past natural situations and natural circumstances and natural things moving through the land with the politics and the silver unrest say man we can look past the natural to the spiritual man because god has made us different he's wild as different he's called us with a different calling amen how many love the lord this morning hallelujah amen now you know a lot of people in general they are proud to reflect where they are from even you know if somebody was maybe let's just say randley from texas or something they'd be proud to say i'm i'm from texas you know you might meet somebody from another country like germany maybe amen they proud to represent you know the fact that they're from a different country they're from a different place and even when i went down to college amen i started to recognize you know people started to to to really put an emphasis on recognizing where they were from and when i went down there down to florida i went to school in florida they were doing something that was unusual to me at the time they was representing where they were from even down to the county amen because i never heard anybody say you know i'm from columbia county uh richmond county are we from lexington county i never heard people talk like that when i got down to florida there was are we from dade county miami 305 we're from dade county huh are we from duval i mean jacksonville that's what you know i said why people are really glad to be from from that little county and what i started to realize is is it didn't matter where people were from even if you were from a little country holding the wall like green pond south carolina that's where i'm from and people are kind of proud to be able to identify where they're from people like to gravitate uh uh next to other people that that are from the same place that they're from even maybe when i was going to school in florida if i would meet somebody from south carolina we was instantly oh you're from south carolina yeah man i'm from south carolina too so man if they were from columbia greenville or whatever amen i had a lot of friends that was from south carolina because we could all be on one accord because we were from the same place but then every now and then you would meet somebody from the exact same town that you were from and what that would do if i met somebody from walterboro see that would bring it in even a little bit more closer amen because now we we are fully from the same place amen see will you from the same place you can identify with each other a lot better amen see without being believed is a like precious faith amen the faith that i hold precious is the same faith that you all precious and not everybody else holds that faith precious but if the both of us are holding that same thing precious now that means that it means a lot to us amen and i can tell by you being here this morning at the word of god it means a lot to you and the same word that means a lot to me means a lot to you you know what that means that i mean we're gonna have a good time in the lord this morning that means we can all be on one accord amen hallelujah even that song we were singing everywhere to worship on one accord it's hard to get the church going good and praising the lord if you got one half of the church maybe singing along and waving the hands and the other half of the church amen they got their arms folded like this amen but we want to get our praise on one accord amen we want to have our spirit on one accord we want to have a mindset on one accord and if we're all in one accord then that's when the almighty god steps in and when he takes over the impossible becomes possible amen when he takes over there's nothing that cannot happen in the service amen you know one reason why people like to reflect where they're from is because where you from kind of mold you in a way man some people that was raised in a tough environment that thing molded them in a way to make them tougher and give them a different mindset about things and see the place that we are from amen is molding us it's giving us a different mindset amen almighty jesus christ said i've come from god amen i'm going back to god amen and when we talk about our same and the bible lets us know that we were made in his image and we were made and his likeness amen i'm just here to remind you that you are made in the very image and likeness of almighty god that's your heritage that's where you're from amen and what the prophet of god said brother branham said amen you're being made in his image and made in his likeness amen and god is a spirit amen so what did he do amen he made your spirit to be like his amen we ain't talking so much about this flesh man that has his ups and downs and his doubts and his faults and his players and he make mistakes from time to time amen sure that man has his things that he do amen but there's a man on the inside of the inside and his reflection is exactly like that of his maker his reflection is exactly that of jesus christ that's what john said when we sin we'll be just like him can we see him as he is we'll see him through the word of god we wash him through the word of god we seeing him operate amen we seeing him bring things to pass that he said he would bring the passing we see him holding you when he said that he will hold him you know when you've manifested where you're from i mean there's a certain culture that you manifest where you're from amen there's a certain way that you walk there's a certain way that you talk amen your speech pattern is a giveaway where you from you know if i'm down in the low country and i start talking to some of the people like this and i say boy go and get some of that rice from over there man where people will start to identify what say much you must be uh get your boy like one of you boys from down there man that would identify me quickly where i'm from and if i don't want people to identify that that i'm from there i'll cover it up i'll talk a little bit more regularly when i start getting home and some of the other people around there they start talking like that a minute that i might get caught up but i might start talking like that cause we all from the same place see when we from the kingdom of god we speak a heavenly language amen we talk about the things that concern almighty god amen we we we we talk about us moving towards this kingdom almighty god has established amen we talk about the things of the spirit amen there's a lot of things in the flesh going on amen a lot of natural things going on lecture went on i mean that's fun to talk about sometimes amen super bowl today that's all right to talk about amen but you know somebody believe amen we like to talk about the things that god amen we like to manifest the things almighty god amen if he know if you know where you come from you know that you come from god you know that you're going back to god there's a lot of circumstances in the middle that we have to deal with in the meantime we know that all these things are going on around and same in civil unrest and the pandemic all those things amen but see because we know we come from and because we know we're going we got that great confidence in god in the meantime amen you know you find that this is a time and an age where people have placed their confidence and a lot of different things outside of jesus christ amen people have placed their confidence and a lot of different things outside of the word of god people have placed their confidence and whether trump would stay in or whether trump would get voted out amen and he saw the people that placed their confidence in trump amen their confidence was so broken that they they did something that seemed to be unthinkable that people were actually stoned the white house man a stone the capitol building rather than it's because they had their confidence placed in the wrong thing amen and then there's people they mean they have their confidence so heavily placed and joe biden amen not understanding it ain't but so much body can do for them he got his own agenda amen he got his own daddy that he got the answer to call pope to call the pope because he's a catholic this morning we ain't afraid to say that so when you start to put your confidence in other things what you end up finding is that those things are end up failing you and me there's a lot of people they put so much confidence in the vaccine that's coming out amen i thank god for the vaccine amen if you ask me if you want the older ones go and take the vaccine that man not wrong with taking the vaccine amen but that's not all of our confidence in it man because people say if we get this vaccine that we have this thing to feed it we can go back doing everything like we want to do everything's going to be all right i'm here to tell you this morning that there's always going to be a certain sense of fear amen that things are never going to fully be the same again because even if that vaccine wiped things out completely and the best one is working at 95 percent the next one coming out is that 85 percent of johnson johnson what am i even if if it weren't even to his fullest amen it's still at five percent it's still at fifteen percent amen there's still the next thing that can come on down the road there's still a brazilian mutation a south african mutation amen so you can put your confidence in those things only but up to a certain extent you know some people put their confidence in getting another stimulus check amen according to god amen but if we get one more check we're gonna be all right and boy we get that next check oh man i mean it's tina what we do we're doing good feeling good and we got that last stimulus checked and we moved it to an uh a a new house that we bought but she ain't like the flaws in that house amen so y'all know what he was able to do with that chat we was able to get my wife the flaws that she wanted and she was so happy about it i said wow if i know that she would have been to everybody we would have did a long time ago but what i'm saying about that stimulus check as quickly as you get it it's gone into something amen and now you hoping for the next check amen and then one time they say we'll send you a check every month and that's all right but you know what happened if they start sending us a check every month and your light bill gonna go up your grocer's gonna go up baby because there's a there's a check and balance to all of these things they meant so i thank god for my stimulus but all my confidence isn't fully in that that's what i'm getting at this morning my confidence is the one amen who who stimulates me with the word amen whatever i have need of he lifts me up amen he ain't gonna cut me off he's not gonna say i don't qualify for the benefit they can't vote in and vote out the plan to redeem me but i'm glad that this one he's stable he's sure he's secure and see if this mattress has been fully revealed to you nobody can take that away from you hallelujah it's a lot of people that was just going all along because mama went on along and daddy went all along and pats went on along and what we find out is that's not good enough it's got to be fully revealed to you personally as an individual and if it's been revealed to you amen you got full confidence in that thing amen hallelujah and that's why we can fight for the things of god like we do amen that's why we can fight against the devil like we do because whatever you got confidence in if you got enough confidence in it i mean to tell you this morning that you're willing to fight for it now you can't fight for anything that you don't fully believe in but if you fully believe in it you can dedicate yourself to it you're willing to turn yourself give yourself fully over to it because you got full confidence in the thing the bible lets us know it man there was a young man named david that came up on the scene and that same prophet samuel that i was telling you about at the beginning of the service here this prophet named samuel he had another purpose and calling in his life and that was to come and anoint david to be king and you know that annoying it was confusing to a lot of people at that point in time it was even confusing to david's own daddy david's own daddy said well out of all of my sons this is the one that they would want to be king but samuel was there to let them know that he wasn't a man that was just doing what the democrats said or just doing what the republicans said they mean sam was there to do a purpose of what almighty god said and if almighty god said anoint uh oh if if he would have told samuel to anoint a bullfrog to be king amen samuel would have did it amen because he knew that word came for the lord but nevertheless he anointed a little shepherd boy by the name of david to be king what happened as the story goes we know about goliath amen and after david slay goliath that that that that took the name of david from just being something people laughed at and snickered at so people started to sing songs about david people start the the whole david's name in high esteem because they they saw how the lord was with david and that great battle against goliath and what happened is the king that was there on the scene and there was already a king in place by the name assault and the bible lets us know that that saul got very jealous of david amen saul got very jealous of david a man these days caused david to have to run amen and hide him in and move from country to country and from place to place because saul was on david's track to try to kill david because maybe saul thought that he could do something to slow down the program almighty god but i'm here to tell you this morning if almighty god has called you to it there is not a devil in hell there's not a a virus there's not a pandemic there's not a social unrest amen that can keep you away from your promise if almighty god has anointed you for that promise hallelujah and david he kind of started out solo but as he went different places as you read through the story in samuel it was different men that recognized something david and they began to have confidence in david and say you know we're going to follow after him because i see something in him and it might have been unpopular at the time to a certain degree because saul had his army saul was trying to hunt them down like dogs amen but the more david went around the more the people started to link up with david amen the more that these men decided that if they were going to fight they were going to fight on the side of david's side they were going to fight for david it didn't matter what hockey was set up in place otherwise but they saw almighty god moving and they had confidence in that thing and because they had confidence in the call to david and they had confidence in the anointing of david they said you know what david we wanted to fight with you amen we will understand next to you you're not necessarily the king right now but we got a belief and confidence in you that you're coming into your throne that you coming in the power way man and david he didn't have an army he didn't have a crown he had all kind of equipment around him and all kind of soldiers just yet for them people to follow behind but one thing that david had was he had the anointing of almighty god and if you got the anointing of almighty god it don't matter what you do god you need to focus on what you do at the anointing the almighty god is able to cover amen it's able to be more than enough because god's anointing it never runs dry man it never falls short it's never not able to meet the challenge of the situation because it's his anointing i'm here to tell you this morning if almighty god has blessed you with his holy ghost simmons that is his anointing amen what did the prophet of god break down tell us what the holy ghost says that's you recognize the word for your day man that's you recognizing the word for your time period in the midst of 2021 those brothers they recognize the word for that data that was david we're going to follow behind it if you recognize the word for your day the revealed word of the hour that's the anointing of god amen and there's not a devil in hell that can stop the anointing of god amen i'm gonna love the lord this morning we ain't gonna keep you all morning hallelujah but the lord said it wasn't for everyone amen some people couldn't catch their mindset that they was going to be king they would still focus on saul how tall saul was how hams he was in the face amen how high his shoulders were was all nice and maybe that six pack he had amen they would still focus on the flat man maybe maybe saul was like uh march chestnut or sherman more of his time maybe they were still looking at the flesh we bringing up today michael b jordan of your time amen everybody looking at it oh man he looked like he needed to be king man he got had people uh with a specific anointing to be came and everybody couldn't catch that they were supposed to be king all they saw was a little ruddy boy that was running around amen and the lord in the scripture in the gospel of john he was telling us the same thing amen that he was from above but some are just from beneath amen they were reflecting where they fronted from beneath amen they were flooding their bloodline he said to them point blank you are of your father the devil that's a harsh thing to say but truth is truth truth is true and when you're dealing with people in this world amen and and you wonder why such and such did this thing like that and why would this person do that towards you why why would this person behave like that in this specific situation amen don't be confused with those things that man just had to understand that everybody is not a child of god they just reflect in their father where they came from and you can follow the devil as much as we like to preach and present presenting that it is for everybody at the end of the day sayings to be honest which is not for everybody even sometimes we witness the people and witness the people amen and even something as simple as water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ according to acts 2 38 you think that would be a simple thing repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus amen but still some people can't understand how that ties into these titles of the father son holy god man father is not a name amen son is not a name holy ghost is not a name amen you you know anybody with a reasonable understanding of the english language should be able to look and and see that what he was talking about in the name of the father son holy ghost said man that that name was lord jesus christ but everybody is not able to see it even and instead of you getting disappointed with their understanding man you got to understand it's not for everybody to understand man some things are not for everybody to understand brother brandon he uses john 8 when he's writing out the church age book and he's reading john 8 amen and and using that as an example and when he's talking about uh them being the father of the devil ave and and the lord being from above and then being from below amen but brahman said it's most evident from these scriptures that no man of himself can hear god amen that ability has to be given of god amen that's in the smyrna church agent you on your own can't hear god amen and that's not saying you on your own you can't hear god so you got to get the preacher you got to get the pope you got to get such-and-such no you on your own can't hear god unless almighty god tunes your ears for you to be able to hear almighty god amen just like in matthew 17 when he was talking to peter it said flesh and blood have not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this revelation tell you and brother brown he turns around and says that that we see in that that is only one very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age there's only one special group of people that group has to be of god because the group that cannot hear is not a god amen and those are the ones that are baptized into the body those are the ones that received the holy ghost say man because those are the ones that recognize where they're from amen and they recognize where they're going hallelujah glory to god musicians y'all can come on out we're gonna keep you all morning here the lord is on the scene in the flesh and he's preaching to the people he's ministering to the people and hear these pharisees they've been looking for a way to trap them for a long period of time because they felt like this jesus christ he was too forgiving they felt like this jesus christ he was associating with too many people of a low standard they felt like this jesus christ he was out there with the publicans and and with the wine bibles and with the prostitutes and they said we're going to catch them now we're going to get them back to the letter of the law lord we caught in the very act of adultery and him being a holy god he would never deny the word he never said that what she was doing was not wrong amen he just said for her punishment amen the one of you that is perfect let you start with the punishment and all that did was reveal to them that none of them were perfect amen and people think god is the god of jesus christ and somebody man it was just a law kind of wiggle room hey man he told he asked him where were your accusers she looked right i said and i hear lord amen he said neither do i accuse you but go and sin no more don't get caught back up in the same day that took you down i forgive you but that don't necessarily mean i want you to continue in that way hear the lord preaching to those pharisees amen after this situation and see what they were doing they were hearing what he had to say but they couldn't understand what he had to say that's why he said to them why do you not understand my speech it's because you cannot hear my word amen and why can you not hear my word because you got a different father and that's a heavy indictment but i'm here to tell you this morning say you can hear his speech if you can understand his word that's because he is your father amen that's because he he he's burger he's brought you into something that you always be able to walk in he's brought you into something that would never leave you or forsake you and all i'm here to do is remind you of that this morning to remind you that you came from someplace higher don't be trapped about it as well and by the things of the world you young sisters amen don't be disappointed because you got to dress different from the rest of the world almighty god made you different from the rest of the world embrace that because there's great blessing that comes with that there's great power that comes with that and whatever you do saints if you know where you're going if you know where you come from then act like you know where you come from act like you know where you're going amen act like you're marrying the king act like you reflect in the ways of the king hallelujah amen i'm gonna leave you with this amen bible tells us about esther man we know that esther amen she was called to be the queen esther had a natural beauty about her amen but the chamberlain still had to come in and teach her how to be the queen amen esther had a natural beauty but but she still had to learn how to conduct herself around the kingdom and as she learned those things and she learned how to carry herself a minute how to move with grace at the right time she knew how to say the right thing before the king man she reflected what she had been taught at man she reflected what she had been trained to do amen she reflected what her purpose and what her calling was you're here to reflect that you're a queen in this hour man you here to reflect that you come from a city whose building makers god we don't get caught up in all these political struggles amen we don't get caught up in in the spirit of racism that's moving all around the country amen because in this day and age i mean it's back and forth for me you got a lot of black people just as racist as a lot of those white folks out there that's racist man and that spirit is a can't say man because so many people have been done wrong for so long and what that does it allows a spirit and a root of bitterness to raise up in the people i mean because they've been done wrong amen and there's no denying that they've been done wrong and still getting done wrong but god is the god of grace it baby god is a god that shows that no matter how much wrong man has done you that he's still more than able to keep you he's still more than able to sustain you amen he has a place amen that he because you came from almighty god he gonna keep you while you're here on this natural journey amen all the way up until we go back to almighty god amen and because we came from we know we're going back jay man and we know who's keeping us in the meantime how many love the lord this morning hallelujah let's just buy our heads amen
