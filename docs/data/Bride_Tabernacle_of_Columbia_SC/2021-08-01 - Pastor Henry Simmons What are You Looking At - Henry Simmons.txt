pray amen number 13 praise it's god 13 we believe the report amen and they returned 20 25 13 25 and they returned from searching the land after 40 days and they went and came to moses and aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel and to the wilderness of peoria and kadesh and brought by the word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came into the land with it thou sinners and surely it flowed with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong they dwell in the land the cities are warm and very great and moreover we saw the children in it there so the giants and the the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jedi sites and the amorites dwell in the mountain and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stealed the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the man that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they bought up an evil report of the land which they search until the children will heal the saying the land through which we have gone to search is a land that eated up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the giant the son of enoch which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight may god bless the reach towards you we receded this morning and i'm just praying and seeking the lord just thinking so many people that we see him come to the end of their journey and as we look at the journey of life it's so many people i'm so grateful that the journey that god has given us and chose us to walk i don't look back and said i regret the journey because a lot of times people you know they choose the wrong path and a lot of times because people choose the wrong path they go through a lot of hardships and difficulties and even at the end of that journey a lot of times you look at folks and they lie in the hospital or they lie at the funeral home and you're grateful that god he came and got you out of the rut and out of the mess you were in the journey that we would have taken the choice that we would have made if god grace and mercy wouldn't have been with us we all would have made the wrong decision and gone down the wrong path but it's only by the grace of god that he changed our course i don't know about you but i i my mind wasn't known you know the lord you know we we it was too much the world had to offer and i'm saying this morning what are you looking at what are you looking at you know what see because a lot of times it's it's because our eyes are focused focusing on the wrong thing and when we will focus on the wrong thing we don't know that a lot of times the devil have things hidden it makes everything look good on the outside but as you go down in as you really get hooked and you get on the wrong path you find out you know i made a mistake i chose the wrong path because where is this path leading me and what do i have what did i achieve was it worth it see a lot of times we don't we don't take stock or we don't value the decisions that we make we don't know the price we have to pay until it's too late i've come around and sat down with many at their death bed and sometimes they were young sometimes they were old sometimes they were miller age the thing that they all had in common at the time of crossing over nothing in this life matters everything that matters don't matter now because my end have come so nothing didn't nothing nothing is of value nothing that i i've achieved nothing that i have it it it don't even matter right now but you look at the one that's a believable and getting ready to cross over and they're saying you know you know i'm ready you know i'm ready to go to a better place now because i know what's waiting on me i know it's waiting on me it's a better it's a better life oh god got something better for me so i don't mind crossing over now because i want to stay here because i want to be with my family and the different ones i want to do more but i don't mind crossing over now my time has come i'm i i i i gladly move on brother and sister i want to say to you what are you looking at what do you see do you see where you're going you might see where you want to go you might see what you want to be and what you want to have it may not include jesus it may exclude the word of god but one thing about it when you come to the end of that road you would wish that the choice i made wasn't my choice but it was his choice you know because somebody's controlling you one way or another if it's not god then it's the devil you're not amen the choices you make you're saying uh i'm gonna trust oh yeah we believe within ourselves that it's my decision i mean yes it's your decision but you've been influenced you've been influenced by spirits spirits and demons they're there influencing you telling you oh you've got to make go this way do this do that those spirits are there and they're influencing they're giving you advice they're telling you oh choose this path go this route it'll be all right nothing is going to happen to you you you you're gonna you're gonna be successful you're gonna be greek you're gonna make it i'm gonna tell you brother it's just all that influence and all that nudging and trying to inspire you to do the wrong thing you wish you would never listen now in numbers here i like the children signing the little song whose report will you believe amen and uh we find that joshua sent them out despite the land and they come back and they come back with the evil report but joshua and caleb i mean excuse me moses moses sent him about despite the land but joshua and caleb came back with a good report are you with me moses said about this the spider-man go check it out and see whether we're going from egypt from bondage we're going over to the promised land but i want y'all to go search the land and see where the line i want you to go inspired out they come back they say no it's just like god gives us decisions he let us look at it he said i know i'm gonna bless you you know i got so many blessings i'm gonna give to you amen but you know amen when you wake up in the morning you got your health you got your strength you got everything god gives you that and then he tells you you know if you seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things i'm going to add to you i'm going to give you god you can't be god-given amen god got so many blessings stored up for you reserved for you amen but the devil is so enticing that he can really oh i'm going to tell you something if the devil could actually deceive a third of the angels in heaven don't you know you know you're no match for the devil if he can make things look so s we're going to take over this place in other words amen heaven gonna be ours we're gonna take over and they believed that they was gonna take over and that the devil lucifer was gonna make things better for him are you with me and you know sometimes people don't believe lucifer exists uh they don't believe that amen that there are spirits that are influencing all they think is you know it's me it's all about me and i and they just think uh you know i'm in control wake up in the morning if you wanna well i can wake myself up in the morning oh i don't need no alarm clock i wake up if i want i'll tell you what you get your little pride and you're gonna wake up i ain't gonna set the alarm clock i am not gonna do that i can wake you i can wake up in the morning you might lose your job because i mean all you guys you just get the bragging on yourself oh man i can you know how many um star athletes that you know will really you know could run fast or can um play basketball football how many oh had confidence in himself all of a sudden they're sitting on the side with a broken leg you know what i'm saying it's so many times our success and what we think how great we are it don't take by the moment just to flip that switch and when the switch is flipped then you you realize how how frail you are and so by the grace of god let me just i don't want to i'm taking too long but here the lamb was just like god said it was but there was other obstacles there that they were looking at and i'm gonna say there are other obstacles that you might be looking at the things that you're looking at and i i wrote down a few things that folk would look at let me go to uh before i go there let me go to the first time you're 17 and um talked a little about that on friday night as caleb was speaking in 32. uh first samuel and uh seven 1732 and david said to saul let no man hard fail because of him god's servant will go out and fight the philistine now david probably was about five feet tall maybe you know and goliath stood up a big old giant nine feet nine tall about a toll almost reached the ceiling and you little okay this giant this giant was a train his name was goliath and just think how big his sword was probably taller than david was and this giant was uh uh uh all of israel they had helmets they had uh breastplates and they had shields and everything but this giant oh can you he had a weaver beam a big old steel ball i mean probably with spikes coming out of it and he said all right israel y'all i'll fight y'all if y'all beat me if
