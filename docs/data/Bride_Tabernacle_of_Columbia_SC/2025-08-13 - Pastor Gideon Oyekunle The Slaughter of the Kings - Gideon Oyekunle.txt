Most holy and righteous father, we are grateful for another opportunity that you have given unto us as sons and daughters of the king that we should gather ourselves together in your most holy name. Father, we appreciate, we bless, we worship and we adore thee. We lift up your great and thy mighty name on high tonight. Father, hear the sheep of your pasture. I've gathered to hear what the great shepherd we have to say. Oh God, may you please pass by this wave. Speak to our heart and encourage us. Take unbelief out of our heart. Give us, oh God, your holy spirit. Take possession. Let there be healing. Healing of the souls, healing of the bodies. Minister your blessings upon us together. Bless your servant. Oh God, Pastor Henry Simmons. Bless the family. Bless the elders of this church. Bless brothers and sisters. Bless the musician. Bless us together. Bless your word. Speak to us. Encourage us. We thank you, Father. We humbly request all these requests and petitions as we receive them by faith and thanksgiving in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. I I want to say good evening friends. It's a privilege. You may be seated. A privilege to be in the house of God again in this evening. Amen. I just want to say, you know, I'm happy and glad, you know, to be uh part of the service tonight. Amen. I want to, you know, appreciate, you know, the pastor, uh, a good friend, uh, pastor Henry Simmons, and also, you know, sister Simmons. I appreciate you know the love you have you know for me to you know bring me this way and to have some time of fellowship together with the saints purchase of the blood of our lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the and uh you know the blood of Jesus Christ is precious &gt;&gt; but the purchased of the blood is much more precious than the blood because when you want to purchase anything you have to look at the cost and then the reason why you pay for it is because what you are paying for is more precious than the price &gt;&gt; and that's why you give it up and tonight as we are here seated we are the purchased of the blood &gt;&gt; and we are much more precious in the sight of God you know than anything else your soul my soul worth more than 10,000 word that's why the scripture says what will a man give in exchange for his soul the price of the soul God paid blood, his own blood. The Bible says we were redeemed by God's own blood. &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be identified &gt;&gt; with you tonight. And I pray that the Lord will help me somehow to humble myself before you this evening and then you know that I will say nothing but what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I want to say I bring greetings from Nigeria from the best woman in the whole world. Amen. My wife send greetings to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My mom sent greetings. My children sent greetings.

God bless you all. I want to also you know recognize the presence of my good friend brother David Belton. God bless you brother. Good to see you under the service tonight. Amen. God bless you saints. We are happy to be here. So without taking time we shall read from the holy scripture the book of Hebrews in chapter 7 verses 1 to3. Hebrews 7:es 1 to3 as we stand in reference to God's word. Several servants of Jesus Christ in Nigeria send their greetings to you and also from the states. Amen. I read Hebrews 7. For this Misedc, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace, without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the son of God, abideth a priest continually. May the Lord bless the reading of his holy word. God bless you may be seated. Amen. Thank you so much. I appreciate you know the musician as well. God bless you all. So tonight for a couple of minutes that we have before us, we are speaking on the subject of the slaughter of the kings. The slaughter of the kings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you can take for meditations the book of Genesis chapter 14 which we are not going to read but I believe you know that we are going to quote you know some scriptures as we go. Now from the holy scriptures that we have read, we were seen or we are seen a picture before us today of a great man by the name Abraham. And the Abraham was the father of the faith. And we know by the scripture that Abraham was called to be an apostle because the word an apostle means a sent one is the same as missionary. The word apostle and missionary they are the same. So therefore you know Abraham was an apostle or a missionary for he was a sjourer and a pilgrim a stranger. Apostle actually means ones that sent out you know from a place. So Abraham was sent of God to a strange land. He was sent of God. &gt;&gt; If you go back to the beginning of the journey of Abraham, we find out that he was coming from the land of Kadia. You know in the city of all according to Genesis chapter 7 uh chapter 11 and chapter 12 we find out that God called him and he separated him you know from his people from all of his associate separated him away from his loved ones and sent him and Sarah his wife into a strange land &gt;&gt; and they were on their way going to be amongst strange people to become to Jonah. And I want to ask you this evening, aren't you happy tonight that you are a stranger? &gt;&gt; That you are a pilgrim that you a sojourer here on earth. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible made us to understand that this world is not our home. &gt;&gt; That's why we sing the song, we are pilgrims and we are strangers here. &gt;&gt; We are seeking for a city to come. &gt;&gt; The boat will soon come to gather the Jewish home. So we are happy tonight to know that we are pilgrims and we are strangers on this earth &gt;&gt; and there's nothing that can hold us back &gt;&gt; for God had a thought of us in his mind &gt;&gt; to spend eternity with him. &gt;&gt; We are object of eternity. &gt;&gt; We belong to eternity. &gt;&gt; We don't just only belong to time. We came from eternity and we step down into time to s John for a moment of time and then you know at the end of it all we go back to eternity. &gt;&gt; So we came from the mind of God &gt;&gt; and we are prim and we are strangers here on earth. So we are so jers here that's the reason why you know Christian we are not bothered you know by the things around us. We are not being influenced you know by the spirit of the day. We are not being influenced by politics. We are not influenced by religious politics, by worldly politics. We are not being influenced you know by economy of this world. Our economy is not determined you know by this world. Our economy is determined by heaven. &gt;&gt; Heaven knows you. &gt;&gt; Heaven knows me. Heaven is taking care of you. Heaven is taking care of men. We are ordained of God. The Bible said in the book of Ephesians chapter one &gt;&gt; that Jesus that that God ordained us. He elected us. Hallelujah. We were predestinated &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Predestination. Hallelujah. Oh, not because we are good. Not because we are perfect, but because God chose us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Abraham was not perfect. Abraham was not good. But God chose him. &gt;&gt; And tonight, you never sought God. I never sought God. But God sought you. God sought me. And God found you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why the Bible even told us in the book of Hebrews chapter 9, the Bible says that he purchased an eternal redemption for us. Hallelujah. Eternal redemption. Think about it, brothers and sisters. Our redemption is eternal. And the redemption means to buy back. And the Bible says eternal redemption. That shows that before you were lost, God has paid the price. &gt;&gt; He has found you already. Before you were lost, he saved you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before you were lost, he bought you. &gt;&gt; Eternal &gt;&gt; in the mind of God, the work has been finished. Hallelujah. That's the reason why there's no man that ever sought God. &gt;&gt; It's God that search for man. Amen. &gt;&gt; You go into the book of Genesis in chapter 3, we find out that when man lost, &gt;&gt; man was hiding away from the presence of God, but God was looking for man. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the voice of God is working. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Have you ever imagined that church of God? The walking voice of God. &gt;&gt; The voice of God, not even God, but God's voice &gt;&gt; is working. It's working, brother. &gt;&gt; It's working. Oh my God. God's voice is working. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. And tonight, brothers and sisters, the voice of God is working. &gt;&gt; It's working right here in Colombia. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's working everywhere. He's seeking for the predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For every sons and daughters of God, the voice of God. Hallelujah. Oh my. Look at Abraham. Though he was an idol from Babylon, he was worshiping idol. That was Abraham. But brothers, God called him &gt;&gt; to separate himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of Genesis 12:1, he said, "Now the Lord has said unto Abraham, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, and onto a land, that I will shield thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shall be a blessing, and I will bless them that bless thee, and cause him that cursed thee, and in thee shall all families of the world be blessed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I tell you tonight, friends, we are called to do the same thing. &gt;&gt; We are called to come out of her. &gt;&gt; We are come to come out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Abraham was coming out of Babylon. Hallelujah. The horse of the car. That was Babylon under Nimrod. &gt;&gt; And the God is calling people today out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; And the Babylon means confusion. And there's a lot of confusion on her today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you see women marrying women, confusion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Men marrying men, confusion. &gt;&gt; Confusion everywhere. &gt;&gt; You see men marrying their pets, confusion. &gt;&gt; It's confusion. Babylon everywhere. And the leaders of the world, they don't even know what to do because there's a confusion. &gt;&gt; It's too much. Confusion everywhere. &gt;&gt; But brother, in the midst of confusion, God is calling the predestinated. &gt;&gt; He's calling the people tonight &gt;&gt; out of confusion. Come out of her, my people. Revelation 18:4. Come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is the voice of God that is working on her today calling the people out of confusion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Come out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Come out of confusion. Don't stay there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So many confusions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You have no choice. You know to choose your gender. But you know every you can do that today. &gt;&gt; Confusion. &gt;&gt; Everywhere. &gt;&gt; You look out. You have confusion everywhere. &gt;&gt; And Abraham responded. to the call of God to come out of confusion. The Bible made us to understand how Abraham responded in the book of Hebrews in chapter 11 from verse 8 to 10. This is the response of Abraham. The Bible says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for inheritance obeyed &gt;&gt; and he went out not knowing whether he went &gt;&gt; by faith he s John in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with Isa Isaac and Jacob their ears with him of the same promise. For he looked for a city &gt;&gt; which at foundation &gt;&gt; whose builder and maker is God. Hallelujah. Aren't you happy? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy tonight. You know the pastor told me is Bible study and we are studying the Bible, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; This was the response of Abraham, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When God called him in Genesis 12, Apostle Paul said Abraham obeyed the voice of God that called him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he departed from Babylon. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Not knowing whether he was going. &gt;&gt; He was just only following the voice that called him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; when God called you, &gt;&gt; when God called me, &gt;&gt; we obey the voice of God. &gt;&gt; We don't have our mind. &gt;&gt; We don't have our to have our reasoning anymore. But brother, we obey the voice of God. &gt;&gt; And we become sojourers &gt;&gt; in the land of promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he became a sjoner, a stranger, a pilgrim in the land of promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? It was not yet time for him to possess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a promise &gt;&gt; that he has to wait for. &gt;&gt; And brothers, this earth is our land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everywhere belongs to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the land of promise. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5, our Lord Jesus Christ said that the meek shall inherit the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not going into heaven to live in heaven eternally. When we go in the rapture, we go in the rapture for a moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been the rapture for the mar of the lamb. We've been in the rapture to Christ Jesus. But brothers, after this world has been renovated &gt;&gt; and has been taken over and the wicked has been destroyed and the devil has been getting rid of, we shall return to this earth &gt;&gt; and we shall live eternally on this earth. &gt;&gt; It belongs to you and I. God made it for you and I before the ball of sin started rolling in Genesis chapter 3. &gt;&gt; And that's why God came down to redeem &gt;&gt; you and your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To redeem you and this earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the way he redeemed you is the way he redeemed the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; The where you redeem this earth, that's the way he redeems you in three stages. Water, blood, and the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And that's how he's going to get this word re redeemed. He's going to wash this world which he did in the days of Noah. Then Jesus Christ came. He cleans it by his blood. Then the next thing will be what? the baptism of fire. &gt;&gt; That's why you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the baptism of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fire of the Holy Spirit is in your &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are born of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and that's why the root of sin and every devils are taken away from you &gt;&gt; and they going to be taken away from this world and this world will be made a beautiful place to live in. And there'll be another garden of Eden again. And you and I, we shall inherit this earth and we shall live and reign with Jesus forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Just love him this evening, church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, listen church. Abraham obey. Oh, amen. because he was looking for a future home. So he became a pilgrim in the land of promise. He was looking for a future home for a future home. That was what he was looking for. And he became a pilgrim and a stranger in the land of promise. And brothers, we are pilgrims and strangers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are looking for our future home. &gt;&gt; It's a promise already &gt;&gt; and we are looking for it. And they listen just before we go, we saw that when God called Abraham over here in Genesis chapter 14 verse 13, the Bible said that Abraham became an Hebrew. Abraham became an Hebrew. You see that? after he has obeyed the voice of God. And there came one that had escaped and told Abraham the Hebrew. If you watch it, he was not Hebrew in Babylon. He was not Hebrew when he was in Kadier. He was not. But brothers, he became an Hebrew because he obeyed the voice of God. And then you know when God called him this was Babylon and there was a river called river Euphrates. If you take some study the Bible study there's a river called river Euphrates that ran the Bible says there were four rivers but out of those four rivers river Euphrates ran right before the throne in Babylon. And it has been that way from the inception of Babylon even till the days of Nebuchadnezzar. It went on that way. And that river is called river Euphrates. And when God called Abraham, Abraham crossed that river and he got to the other side of the river and then they call Abraham. Abraham the Hebrew. Hebrew means one that is from beyond. That is it was from beyond the river. And brothers, I tell you this morning for this evening, dear the land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever. We can only reach that shore by faith decree. For one by one we shall gain that p. You are to dwell with ye mothers. When the ring that God b for you and me brothers, we do not belong here. We belong to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are from beyond. &gt;&gt; We have crossed the river. We have heard the voice of God over other than the book of Gen Revelation. The Bible make us to understand that there are 200 million devils inside river Euphrates &gt;&gt; and the inside river ues those demons have been there from hedges to hes and the brothers is a difficult thing for you to cross that river because it's a Babylonian river that kept the people away from the promise. He kept them away from the promise. He wouldn't allow them to go. Denominational river, rivers of creed and dogmas, rivers of superstitions, rivers of unbelief, rivers of doubt and demons are living in there. But brothers, upon the call of God, upon your life and my life, we heard the voice of God and we cross the river to the other side and we become Gideon the Hebrew. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gideon from beyond. &gt;&gt; Gideon the Hebrew. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy? I'm so happy &gt;&gt; to know that I am an Hebrew in this evening. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Gideon the Hebrew. Now listen church. Upon the call of God upon I mean on our lives so we become the Hebrew. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now listen church. When Abraham become the Hebrew, he took some people along with him. He took his father. He took his nephew Lot. &gt;&gt; Then it wasn't too long the father died. It wasn't too long problem started. When God called you, God wants you to stand alone. &gt;&gt; Don't ever listen to what any other people are saying. God don't want you to take what your father will say about it, what your mother will say about it, what your friends will say about it. God want you to listen to his voice and obey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the many times you know when God call people, people want to seek the opinions of others. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's where we put ourselves into trouble. But brothers, thereafter then there came some problems. The Bible says that there were problems between Abraham esman and Lot Smen. And then they have to do what? Separate. And Abraham said to his brother Lot, he said, "Let's not fight. If you choose to go east, I will go west. If you choose to go west, I will go east. The land is before us." Abraham gave Lot benefit of choice. &gt;&gt; And brothers, that is what Christians should always do. We should always consider one another. &gt;&gt; The Bible say consider one another. Consider your brother. Consider your sister. Give them benefit of choice. Don't you never you know put yourself first. Put them first. &gt;&gt; Let them make their choosing. God has already promised. Let me tell you this friends. You know that the promise was not for Lot. The promise was for Abraham. And you are the one that have the promise. They don't have the promise. &gt;&gt; The promise is unto you &gt;&gt; and unto your children &gt;&gt; and unto them that are far off. And as many as our Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; Only those that God call has that promise. And if God call you, brother, you have the promise. If God don't call them, they don't have the promise. We have the promise tonight because God called us and we obey the voice of God and the full obedience to the word of God entitled us to the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Obey the voice &gt;&gt; and the blessing will be yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And Lord, &gt;&gt; he looked and he saw that the plains of Sodom was well watered &gt;&gt; and he chose to go down to Sodom. And when Lot went down to Sodom, then what happened? &gt;&gt; Abraham stayed and God said, Abraham, &gt;&gt; where are you standing? &gt;&gt; Amen. Look east, west, look north, south, &gt;&gt; everywhere &gt;&gt; belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Stand up &gt;&gt; and begin to walk. &gt;&gt; Walk in the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And brothers and sisters, when you separate yourself from every unbelief, from every doubt, from every fear, &gt;&gt; then the promise of God belongs to you at that time. And you can stand on your faith and you can exercise your faith and you can be walking &gt;&gt; for the land belongs to you. &gt;&gt; For the promises belong to you. &gt;&gt; Walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk. &gt;&gt; Footprint means possession. &gt;&gt; And the in as much as you can walk. &gt;&gt; Everywhere you are walking belongs to you. &gt;&gt; All the promises in the book is yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the promises in above are yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take it, brother. Take it, sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God told Abraham, "Your father," &gt;&gt; he said, "Stand up. Walk." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother, is the time to walk. &gt;&gt; Sister, is the time to walk in the land &gt;&gt; of promise to exercise our faith, &gt;&gt; to call it our own. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Abraham walked everywhere. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. And was claiming every inch of the land &gt;&gt; that the devil stole from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In God's name. Hallelujah. Tonight, our brothers, I want to tell you, blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; Blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All is well. &gt;&gt; All is well. All is well. All is well. All is well. All is well. You can stand brother by faith tonight and begin to walk every inch of the land that the devil has taken away from you and claim them back in Jesus name. Hallelujah. For whatsoever you desire when you pray, believe that you have receive it and you shall have it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is the promise of God. &gt;&gt; And you believe it, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; it will be yours. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Christian brothers and sisters, Abraham walked the land and he was taken every inch of the ground &gt;&gt; that the devil has stolen from him. But brothers, while Abraham was walking, Lord enter into trouble. He enter into problem. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And do you know what happened? The kings came. The Bible said, the kings came. Amen. &gt;&gt; Kings, they came. Principalities and powers came &gt;&gt; from different quarters and they confederated together. Evil spirit kings. They all came together and what did they do? They took Lot, his wife, his children and all the sodomites. took them away because the king of Sodom, the leader of Sodom, they don't have enough power to combat those kings. Those kings are too powerful. They are too strong. They are fierce, their hunger. Oh brothers, and I tell you tonight, if you don't stay under the blood, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; under the token, &gt;&gt; Amen. The king of demons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Demons of principalities and power will carry you away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Lord chose not to stay under the blood. &gt;&gt; He went eastward to Sodom. &gt;&gt; And brothers, that is a sign of backsliding. A sign of backsliding. Don't go eastward. For the sun rises in the east and goeth down in the west. So Saul I mean a lot was going against the sun. Instead of him to follow the son and stay in the presence of the son, he went against the sun backs leading. He was going backward instead of going forward. And brothers, he backslid and he stayed there. And the kings came and fought all those kings of Sodom and the and Gomorrah and the rest of them. Five kings and four kings were in the battle. The reason is because those kings that came, they were more powerful and more stronger &gt;&gt; than the king of Sodom and his group. And I tell you tonight, we have a lot of people today that they are relying upon kings of this earth, &gt;&gt; upon senator, upon governors, upon whatever. But brother, there are some other kings &gt;&gt; that are powerful &gt;&gt; and stronger than the king of Sodom. Lost evil spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you here? Amen. &gt;&gt; They are more powerful and more stronger. Let's quickly read Ephesians chapter 6. Ephesians chapter 6 from verse 10 to 18. See what the Bible says over there in Ephesians chapter 6. From verse 10 to 18. And we are going to stop shortly. The Bible says, "Finally, my brethren, &gt;&gt; be strong in the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the power of his might, &gt;&gt; put on the whole armor of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. that ye may be able to stand against the wise of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For we resto not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against rulershu &gt;&gt; of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We therefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day. and having done all to stand. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Stand therefore having your loins gathered about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet short with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Above all, taking the shield of faith, where we shall be able to quench all the fearing doubt of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. G &gt;&gt; praying always &gt;&gt; with all prayers and supplication in the spirit and watching their with all perseverance and supplications for all saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; These are the kinds of kings that came to Sodom. And I tell you tonight that the world is in sodom condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The world is in sodom condition. &gt;&gt; There are kings in Sodom tonight. presidents and governors and senators and reps and even preachers, churches in Sodom tonight and they don't know nothing. They just live the way they want to live carefree life. But brothers, there are some principalities and powers and the rulers of the dark places of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are spirits. They are falling angels, falling spirits, demon power. And they came from the kingdom of hell. And they were inspiring the people fighting and wrestling against the kings of Sodom. And that's why they were making all kinds of laws. And they can make a law allow women to marry women. It's not their wish. It's not their choice. It is a power that is beyond them. There's a power that is controlling all. Satan said, "This world is mine. He has conquered everywhere. He's fought and fought all those kings &gt;&gt; and he has taken over." Satan has conquered all the kings of this world. He has conquered presidents. He has conquered the governors. He has conquered the pastors, the preachers, churches have been conquered. &gt;&gt; The Oh, hallelujah. Is so close to the truth to deceive the very elected if it were possible. Matthew 24:4 says so. And the devil says, "This word is mine." And he wanted to conquer our Lord Jesus Christ. And he said, "Worship me and I will give it unto you." But brother, that was the great king, our Lord Jesus Christ. That was our Mechised. &gt;&gt; He was more powerful. He was more stronger than the devil &gt;&gt; than all the kings that came down to Sodom to fight them and to conquer them. And Jesus Christ is undefeable. &gt;&gt; He's unconquerable. He's impable. He's all powerful. He's omnipotent. He's great. I am that I am. He is our Lord. He is our king. Hallelujah. And we are the sons of the king. &gt;&gt; We are the children of the king. &gt;&gt; And we unbeatable brother. We undefeable brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because our king is undefeable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But all other kings, &gt;&gt; they have been conquered. They have been defeated and many people, our loved ones have been carried away by those kings that came against Sodom. And the way Abraham the Hebrew had he said, "No way. I will bring him back." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will bring him back. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of the king. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I have the sword of the king. &gt;&gt; And I have all that the king has. &gt;&gt; I will go and bring him back. &gt;&gt; For those kings, those demons, those principalities and powers, they cannot take away my brother. &gt;&gt; I will bring him back. &gt;&gt; I am a child of the king. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the king. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of Mechisedc. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will bring him back. And Abraham was untrained. He does not have the instrument of war. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has nothing. But brothers, he had 318 men that were born in his house. They were untrained. They don't know nothing about the systems of this world. They know nothing about mechanical system. They know nothing. Hallelujah. They were ignorant and unlearned men. But they have been with Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Brother Henry Simmons, you know, the first time we met several years ago, maybe around 10 years ago, he talked to me. He said, "Brother Gideon," he said, "I am ignorant and unlearned men." Hallelujah. And brother, I'm happy tonight to be identified with ignorant and unlearning men. That is what I am. That is what the apostles are. That is what the sons of God are. That was what Abraham was. And brother, we are all ignorant and unlearned men. Even though we may have our PhD, &gt;&gt; but we don't rely, we don't lean on our own understanding. &gt;&gt; We just get those books in order to for school. But brother, we don't rely on those things. We have the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The absolute is here. The power of life is here. We are ignorant and unlearned men. But brother, we have been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; That is a far better school. &gt;&gt; And brothers, Abraham called them together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought them together. He said, "Come on, let's form a band and we are going to pursue those kings. We'll fight for our brother. We'll bring him back." &gt;&gt; Amen. And Abraham brought those great men, amen, you know, together. And they form a band. And they went they form a band. Then they went from BBA to Dan. Hallelujah. Oh my God. My God. Oh my. He came along way from heaven. Hallelujah. Our Lord, our king came a long way from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came down and he went down to hell to seek for you and I &gt;&gt; from one corner of Palestine to the other. And brothers, today he has given us the same commission that this shall follow them that believe in my name. They shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; They will lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. And brother, we are anointed by the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. For him the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you. He will quicken your matter body by his spirit which dwelleth in you. And brother we have the authority tonight over the devil to cast him out. &gt;&gt; To say to Satan, get out of here. &gt;&gt; We must take our brothers back. &gt;&gt; We must take our sister back. They all belongs to us. Our sons and our daughters, we must bring them back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan, you can't hold them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; They must come back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses said we will not leave our little ones behind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't care, brothers. I don't care, sister. Wherever they be found tonight, we have the power. We have the authority to challenge the devil, to challenge principalities and power and to claim every one of them and to bring them back again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it works for you, it will work for your house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can go on your kne form a prayer band. Husband and wife, family, brother, sister, pastor, church, go on our knees and say, Lord Jesus Christ, we are sending the token that lives in us, the Holy Ghost that endures us to bring our brother back, to bring our sister back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We claim healing. &gt;&gt; We claim healing. &gt;&gt; We claim salvation. &gt;&gt; We claim redemption. &gt;&gt; We claim the Holy Ghost. We claim the blessing. We bring it back tonight. We claim it tonight. We claim it tonight. It is ours tonight. &gt;&gt; We claim it, brother. We claim it, sister. It is ours. There's nothing that the devil can do. It belongs to us. And we claim it tonight. We take it back in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We claim it tonight. &gt;&gt; Take it, brother. &gt;&gt; Take it, sister. It's yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Amen. Brothers, in closing, Abraham must be proud. I mean MelkiseDC must have been proud of Abraham his son &gt;&gt; after he slaughtered those kings. Abraham was going back home. Two kings met Abraham. Mechisedc the king of Salem and the king of Sudu. Two kings met him. The first king, he was proud of his son. Man, this is my son. Returning from the battlefield, returning from the slaughter of the king. And he met him on his way home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then what did they do? He brought out bread and wine &gt;&gt; and he give to Abraham, refresh yourself. Wow. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He refreshed himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He met the king. &gt;&gt; And he refreshed himself. &gt;&gt; And Abraham brought out tithe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he gave it to mec. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brothers, I'm here to tell you tonight, we're on our way home. &gt;&gt; We're on our way home. &gt;&gt; And we are not going to heaven defeated. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; We are not going to heaven defeated. &gt;&gt; We are going to heaven as a conqueror. &gt;&gt; As a conqueror, &gt;&gt; for we are the sons and daughters of Mechisel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are more than conqueror. &gt;&gt; We are more than victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're on our way to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. Is a victory match. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a victory match. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; don't be defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look down on yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look down on that little brother, that little sister that passed or went away from the Lord. It is your duty, &gt;&gt; your responsibility to bring them back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we must be proud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of fighting the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For our brothers, &gt;&gt; for our sisterh &gt;&gt; and we are assured &gt;&gt; of victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Victory belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is ours. &gt;&gt; Let's march to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Victory march. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as we are going to heaven, &gt;&gt; Mchisedc will walk out of the palace. In heaven, the Bible says we shall meet the Lord in the head &gt;&gt; in the air. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's going to be a meeting in the air, in the swam.

I have sworn that I don't fight this campaign because of money. I know how to make a denomination a super organization. I am not out to enrich myself to become a multi-millionaire.
