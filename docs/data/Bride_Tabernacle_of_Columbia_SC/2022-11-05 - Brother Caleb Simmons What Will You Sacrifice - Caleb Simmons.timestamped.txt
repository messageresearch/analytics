[33:36] tonight I'd ask that you turn to the
[33:38] Book of Mark
[33:47] Mark chapter 12.
[33:49] and we'll start at the 41st
[33:51] 41st verse
[34:08] March at the 12 and verse 41 when you
[34:10] got to say Amen
[34:12] amen and it reads and Jesus sat over
[34:15] against the treasury
[34:17] and beheld how the people cast money
[34:20] into the treasury
[34:21] and many that were Rich cast in much and
[34:25] there came a certain poor Widow and she
[34:28] threw in two mites
[34:30] which might make a farther
[34:32] which make a farthing and he called unto
[34:35] his disciples and saith unto them verily
[34:38] verily I say unto you that this poor
[34:41] Widow has cast more in than all they
[34:44] which have cast into the treasury for
[34:47] all they did cast into their of their
[34:50] abundance but she of her one that
[34:54] crashed in all that she had even all her
[34:57] living amen God bless her read another
[34:59] word you may be seated
[35:01] amen tonight I'd like to speak on a
[35:03] little topic called
[35:05] what will you sacrifice
[35:07] what will you sacrifice in this story in
[35:10] the Bible Jesus was standing there and
[35:11] he was seeing how they were taking up
[35:13] their offering and he saw many people
[35:16] pour in a lot of things and they pour in
[35:18] great things and God God said here he
[35:21] said
[35:22] that those were not much because they
[35:24] had plenty but this woman all she had
[35:27] she gave everything that she had and God
[35:30] knew that her sacrifice was more and I
[35:32] want to ask you what will you sacrifice
[35:34] there's many things in the Bible where
[35:37] we see there were many sacrifices and
[35:39] from the Old Testament to the new but I
[35:42] want to ask you I wrote down the
[35:44] question if the Lord asked you to give
[35:46] up all would you
[35:48] if the Lord asked you to give up
[35:50] everything would you in this story here
[35:52] you see that the woman she gave up
[35:53] everything she had she gave up her last
[35:56] pennies even though she didn't know
[35:58] where her necks would come from she gave
[36:00] it up because she knew that God was a
[36:02] provider
[36:03] so what will you sacrifice tonight amen
[36:06] go to let's turn to the Book of Genesis
[36:09] chapter 22.
[36:15] story here many may be familiar with it
[36:34] and many may know the story it's about
[36:36] Abraham and Isaac and many know that God
[36:39] promised Abraham a son and it took him
[36:42] over 25 years to get that son and then
[36:45] when he came later on God said I want
[36:47] you to do something for me and this
[36:49] where the Story begins in in verse 22
[36:52] and 1 it said and it came to pass after
[36:55] these sins that God detemt Abraham and
[36:57] said unto Abraham unto him Abraham he
[37:00] said behold here am I he said take now
[37:03] thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou
[37:06] love is and get thou into the land of
[37:08] Moriah and offer him therefore a burnt
[37:11] offering upon one of the mountains which
[37:13] I will tell thee and Abraham rose up
[37:15] early in the morning and saddled his ass
[37:18] and took two of his young men with him
[37:20] in Isaac his son Enclave the wood for
[37:23] the burnt offering and Rose up and went
[37:26] unto the place
[37:27] of which God had told him I want to
[37:29] bring attention here when God called
[37:32] Abraham he said Lord here am I he said
[37:35] behold here am I he didn't stutter he
[37:37] said Lord here am I and when the Lord
[37:39] told him what to do it didn't say that
[37:41] Abraham asked God questions it didn't
[37:44] say that Abraham was wondering what God
[37:46] wanted him to do he says he rose up
[37:48] early in the morning and he did exactly
[37:50] what the Lord told him to do he went on
[37:52] his journey
[37:53] he said what will you sacrifice and it
[37:56] reads on in verse 4 he said then on the
[37:58] third day Abram him lifted up his eyes
[38:00] and saw the place so far off
[38:02] and Abraham said unto his young men
[38:06] abide ye here with the ass and I in the
[38:09] lab will go up yonder and worship and
[38:11] come again unto you see Abraham have
[38:13] faith that even though God told him to
[38:16] take his son
[38:18] and offer him up he knew that he was
[38:20] coming back he understood that whatever
[38:23] God wanted him to do God promised me the
[38:26] son he promised me a great nation from
[38:28] this son so God has a plan above my plan
[38:31] but Abraham was willing to sacrifice him
[38:34] Abraham was willing to say Lord this is
[38:37] what you want and said in verse 6 and
[38:39] Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[38:41] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[38:43] and took the fire in his hand and knife
[38:47] and they went both of them together
[38:50] and Isaac said unto Abraham his father
[38:53] he's his father and said my father he
[38:56] said here in my son he said behold the
[38:59] fire in the wood but where is the Lamb
[39:01] for the burnt offering and Abraham said
[39:04] my son God will provide himself a lamb
[39:07] for the burnt offering so they both went
[39:09] up together see Abraham was trusting in
[39:12] not his ability but God's ability even
[39:15] if he had to sacrifice his son he knew
[39:17] that God was going to do something he
[39:19] knew that God was going to provide for
[39:22] that sacrifice he knew that God promised
[39:25] him and he held on to that promise and
[39:27] if you keep reading down it says in
[39:29] verse 9 and they came to the place where
[39:31] God had told of him and Abraham built an
[39:34] altar there and laid the wood in order
[39:36] and bound Isaac his son and laid him on
[39:40] the altar upon the wood and Abraham
[39:41] strep forth his hand and took the Knight
[39:44] to slay his son and the angel of the
[39:46] Lord called unto him out of heaven and
[39:48] said Abraham Abraham and he said here am
[39:51] I and he said lay not thine hand upon
[39:54] the lab neither do thou anything unto
[39:57] him for now I know that thou fearest God
[40:01] and seeing thou has not withheld thy son
[40:04] not only son from me see God got to the
[40:07] point he said I want to see what will
[40:09] you sacrifice I want to see what you are
[40:12] willing to give up I want to see what
[40:14] what what thing are you willing to give
[40:17] up will it be your most precious gift
[40:19] to Abraham his son was one of his most
[40:22] precious gifts he had gained the many
[40:25] things but his son he was his it was his
[40:27] only son by Sarah and and see he had
[40:30] gained a most precious gift and God said
[40:32] I want you to sacrifice him I want you
[40:35] to give up your only son and he said
[40:37] Lord here am I and he did exactly what
[40:40] God wanted him to but if you read down
[40:42] further you see that God provided a lamb
[40:45] in the bush he provided a ram in that
[40:47] bush where God said I just wanted to see
[40:50] what you were willing to sacrifice I
[40:52] wanted to see what you were willing to
[40:54] give up I wanted to see how far you
[40:57] would go how much could I trust you how
[41:00] much could I trust you with the gift
[41:01] that I want to give you because when you
[41:04] come to that certain point and you come
[41:05] to that area God want to see if I give
[41:07] you this will you give it up for me
[41:10] if I gave you the whole world would you
[41:12] give it up for me because it says in the
[41:15] scripture you don't want to gain the
[41:16] whole world and lose your soul you don't
[41:19] want to get gain all these things in
[41:21] this life and never make it into heaven
[41:23] and God may ask us sometimes what will
[41:26] you sacrifice
[41:27] will it be your job will it be your
[41:30] children he asked Abraham for his son
[41:33] but what would are you willing to
[41:35] sacrifice
[41:37] so there are many things and I think of
[41:39] the story of Jesus
[41:41] the ultimate sacrifice the one that came
[41:45] down for he didn't have to do what he
[41:47] did but he came down for us and he took
[41:50] upon all of our sins and he died on
[41:52] Calvary for our sins and he was whipped
[41:55] and persecuted for us that's what John
[41:57] 19 says and he was sacrificed for us how
[42:01] much more should we be willing to give
[42:03] up the small things in this life to gain
[42:06] eternal life how much more should we
[42:08] look at and say this is not worth much
[42:10] what it's worth is eternal life what is
[42:13] worth is me giving up a small thing in
[42:15] this life Paul said I Die daily why did
[42:18] he say that because he was willing to
[42:21] sacrifice daily for God he was willing
[42:23] to say Lord all the things that I have
[42:25] gained I counted as not all the things
[42:28] that I have achieved I counted as not
[42:30] because it's not worth anything if I
[42:32] don't make it in it's not worth anything
[42:34] Lord if I don't do what you want me to
[42:36] do with my life Lord I want to sacrifice
[42:39] everything for you I want to give up
[42:41] everything for you
[42:43] I said with everything in life when if
[42:46] your plate is full and you say yes to
[42:48] something else something has to come off
[42:51] something has to come off of that plate
[42:53] when your plate is full and you say yes
[42:56] to something else something has to come
[42:57] off I said if you say yes to Jesus
[43:00] you're saying no to the devil if you say
[43:03] yes to heaven then you're saying no to
[43:05] hell it's a choice that you're making
[43:07] but what will you sacrifice
[43:09] will you do you want pleasure for a
[43:11] season or do you want
[43:13] eternal life that's the way that you
[43:15] that you have to go and you have to ask
[43:17] yourself what am I willing to sacrifice
[43:19] what am I willing to give up for you
[43:22] because even though it may be pleasure
[43:24] for this life and on in this season it
[43:27] won't last for long it won't last for
[43:30] for an eternity but I want to get
[43:32] eternal life amen in in the Book of
[43:36] Matthew chapter 6 verse 24 it reads
[43:42] it reads it says
[43:46] it says that no man can serve two
[43:48] masters
[43:50] for either he will hate the one and love
[43:52] the other or else he will hold to the
[43:54] one and despise the other you cannot
[43:57] serve God and Mammon see there was a
[44:00] there was something that he had to
[44:01] sacrifice I remember reading the Young
[44:04] Rich ruler he came to the point and he
[44:06] had something that he had to sacrifice
[44:07] God asked him he said all he said I want
[44:11] you to keep the commanders he said all
[44:13] these things have I done for my youth
[44:15] and then God said give all that I have
[44:18] and give it unto the poor but because he
[44:21] was young he was rich and he thought
[44:22] that he knew everything and said I'm
[44:24] better off I'm better off with all the
[44:27] things that I have in this life he never
[44:29] counted his eternal destination he never
[44:32] looked towards where am I going to spend
[44:34] my future and say that yeah and the
[44:37] Bible says you can't serve God and man
[44:40] you can't serve two masters you got to
[44:42] make a choice what are you willing to
[44:45] sacrifice what are you willing to give
[44:47] up to gain eternal life what what
[44:50] friends are you willing to give up to
[44:52] gain eternal life what people are you
[44:54] willing to let go to gain eternal life
[44:57] I said I was reading one of one of the
[45:00] messages the prophet of gospel he said
[45:02] the Forsaken all
[45:04] and he said he said here he said Jesus
[45:06] said as the scripture says he that
[45:08] loveth the world or the things of the
[45:10] world the love of God is not in him
[45:13] see right it takes forsaken all it takes
[45:16] you giving up everything to reach
[45:19] eternal life
[45:23] he said there was another part of
[45:25] Abraham where he said now Abraham
[45:27] forsaken his people what did he get back
[45:30] out of it what comes besides that he
[45:34] becomes the father of many nations God
[45:37] made him the father of many nations what
[45:40] little he gave up then look what he
[45:43] become
[45:43] Jesus said he who will forsake me will
[45:47] have fathers mothers and so forth look
[45:49] what Abraham got by forsaking all and
[45:52] following him yes sir the father of many
[45:55] nations but first he had to separate
[45:57] himself from all unbelief even from his
[46:01] cold lukewarm and church member brother
[46:03] lot he had to forsake himself for that
[46:06] everything that's got unbelief in it you
[46:09] have to separate yourself everything
[46:11] that has unbelief in it you have to
[46:13] separate yourself anything if it's a
[46:15] Creed if it's if you're in church and
[46:17] that's all you're dependent on is a
[46:19] Creed and don't believe the word it's
[46:21] the word if the word is contrary to the
[46:24] Creed is contrary to the word you'll
[46:26] have to forsake that you'll have to
[46:28] forsake everything
[46:29] and listen he said and God never did
[46:32] bless Abraham until he totally obeyed
[46:35] him
[46:36] God never blessed Abraham until he
[46:39] totally obeyed him Abraham wanted to
[46:41] take his daddy along and the old man was
[46:44] a fly in anointment all the time finally
[46:46] he died
[46:48] and then a lot there was Strife in
[46:50] everything and then as soon as Abraham
[46:53] fully obeyed God and separated himself
[46:57] and let and let lot go down there to the
[47:00] good lands where he wanted to go down in
[47:04] Sodom then God appeared to Adam's
[47:06] Abraham and said lift up your eyes I
[47:09] give you I give the whole thing to you
[47:12] so what are you willing to sacrifice
[47:14] Abraham didn't want to sacrifice his
[47:16] father
[47:17] Abraham didn't want to sacrifice his
[47:20] neighbor his nephew but God had to
[47:22] remove them he had to sacrifice and let
[47:25] him go let him go their ways before he
[47:27] could get his Blessing
[47:29] before he could get the promise
[47:31] everything that God promised him said as
[47:34] soon as Abraham fully obeyed and
[47:36] separated himself God gave him
[47:39] everything that he told him he would
[47:40] give him so what are you willing to
[47:42] sacrifice what are you willing to put on
[47:45] the Altar and leave it there what are
[47:48] you willing to say Lord I'm going to put
[47:50] this in your hands and leave it there so
[47:52] that I can get everything that you want
[47:54] me to to have
[47:56] I said there were many things in the
[47:58] Bible where you look at there were many
[48:01] sacrifices you look at the story in
[48:03] Genesis 4 of Cain and Abel both two Cain
[48:07] made a sacrifice and Abel made a
[48:09] sacrifice but God only came down on one
[48:13] God only came down on Abel's sacrifices
[48:16] because it was the right sacrifice
[48:18] it was the right sacrifice that Abel did
[48:21] and Cain got jealous and that's why he
[48:23] killed his brother but he gave the right
[48:25] sacrifice what do you what will you
[48:27] sacrifice
[48:29] because many of times you come to the
[48:31] crossroads and you can't sacrifice
[48:32] something but God may be like that's not
[48:35] what I wanted
[48:36] that's not what I wanted you to
[48:38] sacrifice but but we think that it's
[48:40] okay because we sacrificed
[48:43] we think that it's okay because we gave
[48:45] God something
[48:47] I I like to say don't give God a mess
[48:49] give them your best
[48:51] because that's what God requires of her
[48:53] he gave his best for us he sent his only
[48:56] son down so why should we give God a
[48:58] mess why should we give God anything and
[49:01] expect him to accept it that's what Cain
[49:04] did and God said I don't want that
[49:07] sacrifice God said that that's not what
[49:09] I require he said I require the blood
[49:12] yeah I require the sacrifice of the Lamb
[49:15] the blood the Abel required and Cain God
[49:18] tell us but why do we expect God to to
[49:21] accept sacrifices that we give him when
[49:24] it's not our best
[49:25] why should we if God did Cain like that
[49:28] why why shouldn't he reject ours
[49:34] but what will you sacrifice tonight
[49:37] and there was a woman in the book of
[49:40] Kings
[49:41] she was a widow woman and she had a
[49:43] child and there was a famine in the lane
[49:44] in the land and many know the story this
[49:47] woman she got there and she was a widow
[49:49] and she said all I got is one meal left
[49:52] all I have is one meal left and me and
[49:55] my son are going to eat this meal and
[49:57] we're gonna die
[49:58] but she met somebody out there one day
[50:01] he said make me a meal first
[50:03] she didn't know who it was but she said
[50:05] okay I'll do it and she and she went
[50:08] ahead and and it was a Prophet Elijah he
[50:11] said if you make my meal first your oil
[50:14] will never run dry in your cup and your
[50:17] couple would never run bare see it was
[50:19] what she was willing to sacrifice it was
[50:22] she gave everything that she had because
[50:24] that was all she had she gave everything
[50:27] that she had because that was all that
[50:29] she had sometimes God said I want you to
[50:32] give me everything that you have I want
[50:34] you to give it all and he wants to see
[50:36] if you're going to do it with job he
[50:39] came and he took it all and he he took
[50:41] everything from job except for his life
[50:44] and because God knew what job possessed
[50:47] he knew what Joel was willing to
[50:49] sacrifice for him he knew what job was
[50:52] willing to put down for him and said I
[50:54] know job through all his struggle he
[50:56] said I know my redeemer lives he through
[50:59] all the things that God took for him and
[51:01] he and he sacrificed he knew that God
[51:04] was still able God was still able to
[51:06] bring him forth but what will you
[51:08] sacrifice
[51:10] what are you willing to give off for him
[51:12] because God requires us all to sacrifice
[51:15] something
[51:16] God requires us all to give up something
[51:18] God requires us no matter what it is and
[51:21] what you may have to give up may be
[51:23] different from me but he requires it
[51:25] from each and every one of us he asks us
[51:27] what will we sacrifice I think of the
[51:30] story of Peter Peter one time he came he
[51:33] came and he thought about it maybe he
[51:36] said
[51:38] said he said there
[51:46] Sarah Peter asked the Lord he said now
[51:49] we have forsaken all to follow you we
[51:52] have forsaken all look what we have done
[51:54] we left our homes we left our families
[51:57] we left our lands we left everything
[52:01] we had to follow him see Peter they gave
[52:04] it up all when Jesus called them off the
[52:07] ship they left their father in the ship
[52:09] and said we're going to follow this man
[52:10] because we know that who he is and they
[52:14] began to Dawn on him and maybe he had
[52:16] been carried so far away in the work
[52:18] watching Christ and so forth that he had
[52:21] never dawned on him that he had left his
[52:23] home he has left his family he had left
[52:26] his father and his mother he had left
[52:28] all that he had to follow Jesus
[52:31] sometimes Christ calls us to a life of
[52:33] separation and you wonder why why do I
[52:36] have to separate us but sometimes I
[52:38] think back and I said maybe that's what
[52:40] God wants me to do in order to make it
[52:43] maybe that's what I got to do to make it
[52:46] you question why you go through certain
[52:48] things but we never think of maybe God
[52:51] wanted me to sacrifice these things for
[52:54] me to make it but that's exactly what
[52:56] God requires forsake all and follow him
[52:59] that's God's requirement we've got to do
[53:01] it sometimes we got to forsake our very
[53:05] thoughts
[53:07] if our thoughts about anything is
[53:09] contrary to God's word we've got to
[53:12] forsake our own thinking to follow him
[53:15] and the only way we can follow him is
[53:18] follow his word obey it God requests and
[53:21] require and God's requirements that we
[53:24] forsake all and follow him and the only
[53:27] way we can follow him is through his
[53:29] word each and every day Lord send me a
[53:32] word that I may follow you Lord created
[53:35] me a clean heart O Lord and renew a
[53:37] right spirit in me that's what David
[53:39] said because he knew that he needed more
[53:41] to sacrifice he said Lord I got to give
[53:44] more to you I got to do more for you
[53:46] Lord Jesus I gotta Lord give up some
[53:49] more because Lord I want to see you
[53:51] working in my life I want to know that
[53:53] Lord when I go to play Lord you're with
[53:55] me not just in me you're with me as well
[53:58] Lord and Lord I Want Your Presence to be
[54:00] near
[54:01] that's why David said Lord created me a
[54:03] clean heart that's why Paul said Lord I
[54:06] Die daily because he wanted God's
[54:08] presence with him each and every day he
[54:11] knew there was a continual sacrifice
[54:13] there was a continual dying out to God
[54:16] there was a continual say Lord work on
[54:20] me Lord chiseled the things out of me
[54:21] that's not like you to take everything
[54:24] that's not like you out of me Lord that
[54:26] you may get the glory not my glory but
[54:28] your glory Lord not what I want but what
[54:31] you want me to do Lord I can forsake all
[54:34] I can sacrifice everything and know the
[54:37] Lord there was no one that you didn't
[54:38] provide more than I exceedingly
[54:41] abundantly more than we can ask a thing
[54:43] because that's who God is that's who God
[54:46] is he promised to be a provider he
[54:49] promised to be a Healer he promised that
[54:51] if you forsake it I will do I will do
[54:54] more than you can ever think
[54:57] and he said that if the devil is after
[54:59] you
[55:00] if the devil ain't after you he's got
[55:03] you
[55:04] that's all because as long as he's after
[55:07] you that's a sign he hasn't got you yet
[55:11] but if he isn't after you it's a sign
[55:13] that he's got you yeah so just remember
[55:16] as long as he's blasting at you you're a
[55:19] few jumps ahead of him yet just keep on
[55:21] going just keep on going and if you
[55:24] continue to sacrifice to the Lord the
[55:27] more he'll do
[55:29] the he'll do for you
[55:33] he says here he said if you forsake the
[55:36] things of the world in the world and the
[55:38] things of the girl God will repay you so
[55:41] many times
[55:42] God will repay you so many times I know
[55:45] we have many witnesses of what God can
[55:47] do if you sacrifice for him there's so
[55:50] many people sitting here that can say
[55:52] Lord you can see the works of what God
[55:54] has done in your life to see the works
[55:56] of what how far God has brought you by
[55:59] your sacrifice to him just sacrifice in
[56:02] your life to him and it's a testimony to
[56:05] see the ones that walk with God the ones
[56:08] that know that just sacrificing in your
[56:10] youth provides a life that God that you
[56:13] never thought you may have and when you
[56:15] look around for the people that were
[56:17] around you and see where the life end up
[56:19] and you see where yours is all you can
[56:21] do is say thank you Lord thank you Lord
[56:23] that I sacrifice when I did no matter
[56:26] when it was when you came and gave that
[56:28] sacrifice to him do you say Thank You
[56:30] Lord because I should have been here and
[56:32] I would have been there but God you kept
[56:35] me God you know from My Sacrifice Lord I
[56:38] might not have been perfect but God you
[56:40] accepted the Lord I want to present and
[56:42] blameless before you Lord I want to give
[56:45] you everything Lord that you continue to
[56:47] work you continue to go on you continue
[56:49] to move in my life Lord you continue to
[56:51] guide Lord I want to continue the
[56:54] sacrifice that we can see your work in
[56:56] my life I can see you moving I can see
[56:58] you living I can see you doing the
[57:00] mighty things of God because I want to
[57:02] put the right sacrifice on this altar I
[57:05] want to give you everything Lord because
[57:07] I know that you can do it I know I
[57:09] believe that you can do it Lord you said
[57:12] in your word that you would do it and
[57:13] I'm standing on that I'm resting on this
[57:16] Lord I'm standing on your promises I'm
[57:19] standing I'm believing that Lord you've
[57:21] never lost one I'm believing that God
[57:23] you are a Healer Lord I'm believing that
[57:26] you are a deliverer I'm believing that
[57:28] you're the only one that can provide
[57:30] Lord I'm believing that no matter how
[57:32] the world looks today you still got me
[57:35] you're still keeping me Lord and it's by
[57:37] My Sacrifice down on my knees praying
[57:40] Lord that you'll provide Lord are down
[57:43] on my knees saying Lord I Thank you for
[57:45] everything that you've done I thank you
[57:47] for keeping me I thank you see it's a
[57:49] sacrifice to pray it's a sacrifice to
[57:52] get before him and say Lord I need you
[57:54] it's a sacrifice to admit Lord I'm wrong
[57:57] it's a sacrifice to get down and say
[58:00] Lord I want you
[58:02] I want you to move in my life I want you
[58:05] to provide in my life Lord see people
[58:08] may look at you strange by the way you
[58:10] live in your life that's a sacrifice to
[58:13] not go against to go against the current
[58:15] that's a sacrifice but you never look at
[58:18] it like that and say I want to do this I
[58:19] want to do that it's a sacrifice not to
[58:22] do what everyone is doing it's a
[58:24] sacrifice to when people say we going
[58:26] here and you say no
[58:28] when you say no I'm not going to do this
[58:30] because this is not right I don't
[58:32] believe in doing this but that that's a
[58:35] sacrifice and God is expecting us to
[58:38] make the right sacrifice God is
[58:40] expecting us to bring the right
[58:41] sacrifice to him that he may get all the
[58:44] glory that he may get all the honorable
[58:46] what will you sacrifice have you come to
[58:49] that point that you willing to give a
[58:51] sacrifice give your sacrifice to him
[58:53] have you come to that point where you
[58:55] come to the altar where God calls and
[58:57] may knock like Abraham and say will you
[59:00] say Lord here am I and whatever God
[59:02] tells you to do you do it
[59:05] whatever he said you don't question it
[59:07] you do it like Abraham he didn't
[59:09] question God he did it
[59:12] God asked him for the one of the most
[59:14] precious gifts that he had given him
[59:16] he said will you give it back to me
[59:20] God may ask you will you give me what he
[59:23] has given you
[59:24] will you give him and you'll be like
[59:26] well God you gave it to me why would you
[59:28] ask for it back
[59:30] why would you ask for what you gave to
[59:34] me back
[59:36] or maybe it's a test maybe as God is one
[59:39] to see how far will you go
[59:42] how how far are you willing to give that
[59:45] sacrifice will you stop
[59:47] will you say that no I'm not going to do
[59:50] this I'm not willing to sacrifice this
[59:53] I'm not willing to sacrifice that but
[59:56] Abraham had to get to the point where
[59:58] everyone around him had to move away
[59:59] they had to get around so that he could
[1:00:02] get his true blessing he could get all
[1:00:04] the blessings that God promised him but
[1:00:07] what are you willing to sacrifice what
[1:00:10] are you willing to give to him to reach
[1:00:13] everything that God has for you
[1:00:18] foreign
[1:00:20] [Applause]
[1:00:32] you know these last couple days I've
[1:00:34] been telling a lot of people I said you
[1:00:37] know out of all the out of all the
[1:00:39] achievements in life
[1:00:41] or everything you seek out to do
[1:00:45] and the Lord might bless you to achieve
[1:00:47] it
[1:00:47] I says but when you leave in this world
[1:00:50] it's only one thing that's going to
[1:00:52] matter
[1:00:53] and whether or not your soul right with
[1:00:55] God or not
[1:00:57] so I said out of all the I've been
[1:00:58] telling people that for the last couple
[1:01:00] days out of all the achievements
[1:01:02] you remember now there's only one thing
[1:01:04] that's going to matter when you're
[1:01:05] leaving this world
[1:01:07] out of all your disappointments out all
[1:01:09] of your highs and all your lows
[1:01:12] when you leave in the world this world
[1:01:14] it's only one thing that's going to
[1:01:16] matter
[1:01:17] whether or not your soul right with God
[1:01:19] or not
[1:01:20] So I says
[1:01:23] just saying that to people and just
[1:01:25] thinking about that myself I says only
[1:01:28] things you do for God is what's going to
[1:01:30] last
[1:01:31] and that's what all our pressing is
[1:01:33] about and that's why we go the extra
[1:01:35] distance
[1:01:36] that's why we do the extra you know it's
[1:01:39] easy I was ministering the other day I
[1:01:42] was out of the Book of Malachi and how
[1:01:44] he was telling them you bring the
[1:01:47] polluted the lame the blind all these
[1:01:49] things and you offer them up to me
[1:01:51] and he began to say tell him you know
[1:01:54] you robbed me wherewith you robbed me
[1:01:56] through tithes and offerings he says you
[1:01:58] say that we ain't gonna do pretty much
[1:02:00] what we're supposed to do because we're
[1:02:02] doing it in vain
[1:02:04] and he says but I want you to prove me
[1:02:07] he says I want you to prove me he says
[1:02:10] return unto me
[1:02:11] and he says if you prove me he says and
[1:02:14] watch when I open the windows of heaven
[1:02:16] and pour you out blessings
[1:02:18] that you won't have room enough to
[1:02:19] receive I said a lot of times people
[1:02:22] stop short
[1:02:23] of doing all that they could or as I
[1:02:27] brought kids saying making that
[1:02:28] sacrifice because they say we're doing
[1:02:30] it in vain God ain't blessed us yet
[1:02:33] or God ain't blessing us but you can't
[1:02:36] gain as godliness
[1:02:38] but you forgot that the Bible says
[1:02:40] wherever you find yourself at remember
[1:02:41] to be content
[1:02:43] and you know that it ain't always uh
[1:02:47] Financial in those areas but God bless
[1:02:50] you with the gift of life
[1:02:53] we bless you with eyes to see legs to
[1:02:55] walk and all those things I said so you
[1:02:59] know in serving God it's not it's not
[1:03:02] hard
[1:03:03] when you love God
[1:03:06] when you when God God come really come
[1:03:09] into your life and you gave it all over
[1:03:11] to him because you was tired of the
[1:03:13] world
[1:03:14] you was tired of the devil beating you
[1:03:16] down it's not easy it's not hard I meant
[1:03:18] to serve God
[1:03:19] it becomes easy
[1:03:21] you know but
[1:03:23] as my brother Kenneth was saying tonight
[1:03:24] how God tries you a lot of times you
[1:03:27] give up a lot of stuff but you hold back
[1:03:30] a lot of stuff too
[1:03:32] and God comes after those things
[1:03:34] because he knows that you'll love those
[1:03:37] things more than him
[1:03:39] so he began pulling on him but I thank
[1:03:41] God because you know I only Prophet God
[1:03:44] was saying once that you know sometimes
[1:03:46] you have to uh just paraphrase and look
[1:03:49] look whatever something that's hold you
[1:03:51] hold dear to you in the face and turn
[1:03:53] around and walk away from it in order
[1:03:55] for your soul to be saved but I says in
[1:03:59] all our running I'll run a name in vain
[1:04:01] I was sharing with somebody the other
[1:04:03] night I says you know you already in
[1:04:06] your 40s and I'm right there at the door
[1:04:09] 40. I says no
[1:04:11] when we was teenagers I said we ain't we
[1:04:15] ain't never thought about this this day
[1:04:17] coming
[1:04:18] when I said time flying in it
[1:04:21] so you have time flying
[1:04:23] I said so there's a little bit of time
[1:04:25] that we got
[1:04:27] the little bit of time we got here come
[1:04:29] on this ain't nothing compared to
[1:04:31] Eternity
[1:04:32] not compared to eternal life you know
[1:04:35] and what we give up so I say what are
[1:04:38] you to sacrifice come on Jesus gave all
[1:04:40] what will you give
[1:04:42] you know I was reading that scripture
[1:04:44] the other day how when Peter and Jesus
[1:04:47] told him go out and cast your nets they
[1:04:49] went out and cast them and it says when
[1:04:51] they got back to the bank the Bible says
[1:04:52] they forsook all and followed him and
[1:04:55] they didn't look back neither did they
[1:04:57] but they went on with God so what will
[1:05:00] you give up tonight remember as I said I
[1:05:03] was saying all week
[1:05:06] out of all your achievements think about
[1:05:08] it all your plans
[1:05:10] or if you already achieved your plans
[1:05:12] everything you seeking after all your
[1:05:14] goals you know out of all your hardships
[1:05:17] the bad times the good times out of
[1:05:20] everything in this life that you've
[1:05:22] faced with or that you're reaching for
[1:05:24] you know it might not be outside of
[1:05:27] uh God's will or it might not be a sin
[1:05:30] or those things but keep somewhere in
[1:05:33] your heart
[1:05:35] on your mind
[1:05:36] that none of that ain't gonna matter
[1:05:39] when you leave in this world
[1:05:42] but only things you do for God is that's
[1:05:45] what's gonna last
[1:05:46] you know Jesus was talking about people
[1:05:48] that rich down here on Earth but they
[1:05:51] pour up there
[1:05:53] I said God I don't want to be that way
[1:05:55] if I have to be in rags and sometimes
[1:05:58] you say oh that's just a sin but God
[1:06:00] knows that's the truth I want my soul to
[1:06:03] be saved I want my house to be saved I
[1:06:06] want all around me to be saved because
[1:06:09] we can look back after it's all said and
[1:06:12] done and say what did it mean it didn't
[1:06:15] mean nothing that rich man when he woke
[1:06:17] up and lifted up his eyes in hell
[1:06:19] come on he realized then what matter
[1:06:23] what what really mattered didn't he
[1:06:26] he realized it then
[1:06:27] so I said at all achievements all the
[1:06:29] reaching all of what you striving to do
[1:06:33] remember when your eyes are closing
[1:06:35] maybe God should take you that way
[1:06:39] but when you leaving
[1:06:41] it ain't but one thing that's gonna
[1:06:43] matter
[1:06:44] where I'm work in the morning like they
[1:06:47] say when I Rise Give Me Jesus
[1:06:49] Lord I don't know about you but I think
[1:06:51] about that all the time where am I
[1:06:53] standing with you
[1:06:56] so I lay down tonight Lord where am I
[1:06:58] standing with you
[1:07:00] I get up go to off in my day because
[1:07:03] things can happen at any time
[1:07:06] anything can happen at any time but I
[1:07:09] said Lord where am I standing with you
[1:07:11] you know so many people went on about
[1:07:13] their daily business not even thinking
[1:07:15] about that and and God called for their
[1:07:18] life or he called for them
[1:07:20] and they had to be required of what did
[1:07:23] they do with the time that he gave them
[1:07:25] I told the people the other day some
[1:07:27] people I said God only obligated to call
[1:07:29] you once
[1:07:32] so today you hear his voice you need to
[1:07:34] take heed to his voice
[1:07:36] because it's the mercy of God that you
[1:07:38] can hear his voice I'm so glad I'm so
[1:07:41] glad today as I was sharing with the
[1:07:42] person the other day that you know while
[1:07:44] we were teenagers I'm glad that when I
[1:07:46] heard his voice I answered it
[1:07:49] it was tough you say it was tough and I
[1:07:52] say it wasn't
[1:07:53] really tough because it was something
[1:07:55] pulling on me
[1:07:57] it was something that was reaching out
[1:07:58] to me
[1:07:59] and I even said myself Lord I don't know
[1:08:01] how I'm gonna do it I'm gonna need your
[1:08:03] help
[1:08:04] and don't you know God help me because
[1:08:06] the desire was there
[1:08:09] and that's what God working with even
[1:08:11] tonight the desire no matter where you
[1:08:14] are in life position you find yourself
[1:08:16] God working with the desire do you have
[1:08:18] the desire to serve God
[1:08:20] do you have the desire do you do you
[1:08:23] want God
[1:08:24] I told somebody that I said you got to
[1:08:26] First make it up in your mind whether
[1:08:28] you want to serve God or not other than
[1:08:30] that we're just going through the motion
[1:08:32] you know you're gonna come and and just
[1:08:35] go through all emotion and still don't
[1:08:37] make it I says but do you do you want to
[1:08:40] serve God
[1:08:42] because if you do he made a way
[1:08:45] through a shed Blood on the cross you
[1:08:47] know he came down he did it just for you
[1:08:50] and I how rotten how filthy and all
[1:08:53] those things we were but remember what
[1:08:56] he did on the cross if you can receive
[1:08:58] that I know one thing when I received
[1:09:01] received it it did something for me when
[1:09:05] I when I looked to Calvary it lifted me
[1:09:07] up out of the place I was at I was in
[1:09:10] darkness
[1:09:12] I'm in real darkness
[1:09:14] but when I saw Calvary it did lift me up
[1:09:17] out of that place
[1:09:18] it made me a free man the way I could
[1:09:21] worship God freely
[1:09:23] I didn't have to come to the house of
[1:09:25] God and be bound and change them in
[1:09:27] those things anymore but God did
[1:09:29] something for my life you know a lot of
[1:09:31] people might have looked they say oh he
[1:09:33] pretending but none of that didn't
[1:09:34] matter
[1:09:35] because God did something for me
[1:09:38] God knows y'all love the Lord tonight
[1:09:40] come on what would you sacrifice
[1:09:42] remember all you reaching for and
[1:09:45] grabbing for
[1:09:46] and we all got goals that we reaching
[1:09:49] and trying to achieve but somewhere in
[1:09:52] your day somewhere when you go on alone
[1:09:55] having your mind Lord
[1:09:58] if you were to call me right now it's my
[1:10:00] soul right or or having your mind God
[1:10:03] where do I stand with you all the money

[1:10:07] your eyes are closing all the houses all
[1:10:10] the land all the popularity none of that

[1:10:13] closing you just another one got to

[1:10:33] knowing he ain't worthy come on
