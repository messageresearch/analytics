[12:26] realizing our help coming from the lord
[12:29] that made the heavens and earth
[12:31] father is not anything too hard for you
[12:33] to do
[12:34] now lord may you bless
[12:37] service this morning in jesus name
[12:40] amen
[12:43] and he answered him and said o
[12:46] faithfulness generation
[12:49] how long shall i be with you how long
[12:51] shall i suffer you
[12:53] bring him unto me
[12:55] and they bought him unto him and
[12:58] when he saw him straightway the spirit
[13:02] tapped him
[13:03] and he fell on the ground
[13:06] and wallowed
[13:07] forming
[13:09] and he asked his father
[13:12] how long is it a goal since this came
[13:17] unto him
[13:18] and he said of a child
[13:22] and of time it has cast him into the
[13:26] fire
[13:27] and into the water to destroy him
[13:31] but
[13:32] if thou can do anything
[13:35] have compassion on us
[13:38] and
[13:39] help us
[13:42] jesus said unto him
[13:45] if thou can believe
[13:48] all
[13:50] if thou can believe
[13:53] all things are possible to him that
[13:57] believeth
[13:58] god bless you in his word you may be
[14:00] seated
[14:01] if god can believe all things are
[14:04] possible
[14:06] amen
[14:08] now amen
[14:10] the man needed help
[14:14] and when you need help amen
[14:16] praise god you got to know
[14:19] where you can get some help from
[14:22] but david said in psalms 121 i will lift
[14:25] my eyes into the heels from whence
[14:27] coming to my help
[14:29] for he said my help cometh from the lord
[14:31] that made the heavens and earth
[14:35] there was another place it says is there
[14:38] anything too hard for god
[14:41] so with god all things are possible
[14:46] so here the man said lord if you can do
[14:49] anything
[14:52] if you can do anything it's not if god
[14:55] can god
[14:56] can they meant god can do all things
[15:02] and he said i can do all things through
[15:04] christ that strengthened me
[15:06] [Music]
[15:08] it's not if god can we know that god is
[15:11] more than able to do what the word said
[15:15] praise god we're not serving a god that
[15:17] cannot do we are serving a god that can
[15:20] do all things
[15:23] all things are possible
[15:27] amen the song says all things are
[15:29] possible only
[15:32] only believe all things are possible
[15:35] praise god we sin no
[15:38] the earth is shaking the world is
[15:40] they meant
[15:42] turned upside down the trauma is hitting
[15:45] the world from every angle
[15:49] as the power outage is going on and
[15:52] came to church this morning and
[15:54] amanda had power and then the power went
[15:57] out and then we said god if it's
[15:59] possible if
[16:01] if god willing amen he'll let the power
[16:04] come on and we'll be able to go alive
[16:07] this morning and so we thank god that he
[16:09] gives us a little grace this morning in
[16:12] space amen that we're able to have amen
[16:15] live service
[16:18] so by the grace of god here we are this
[16:20] morning all things are possible
[16:22] to them that believe amen
[16:24] but we find out that
[16:27] many times folks who believe but they
[16:29] believe only for a cease and they
[16:32] believe and sometimes they amen they
[16:36] come to places in their lives amen till
[16:39] they give up
[16:42] amen they don't keep on believing it
[16:44] comes to a
[16:45] place amen when folks
[16:48] tell you amen amen uh that
[16:51] it's no use in believing no it's too
[16:53] late
[16:56] now in john
[16:58] 11
[17:01] and 39
[17:03] 11 39
[17:06] jesus
[17:09] said
[17:11] take away the stone martha
[17:18] take away the stone martha
[17:21] the sister
[17:22] of him that was dead
[17:25] said unto him lord talking about ladders
[17:29] by this time he stinketh
[17:33] i said with god all things are possible
[17:37] ladders had been dead four days
[17:41] and uh amen
[17:45] and he had began to model
[17:49] mortify
[17:50] everything is gone
[17:53] skin worms eaten
[17:56] if you ever smelt somebody that
[17:59] they meant that
[18:01] is dead and rotten
[18:06] then it's a smell that
[18:08] you know it exceeds
[18:10] the smell sometimes of
[18:13] animal but when a human being is dead
[18:15] it's an awful smell
[18:19] and uh she didn't want the stone to be
[18:22] taken away because of the stink that
[18:25] they was gonna smell
[18:28] you know it looked like an impossible
[18:30] situation because it was too late
[18:35] and i said don't give up your faith
[18:38] for with god all things are possible
[18:42] amen don't look at the circumstance
[18:44] don't look at the condition don't look
[18:46] at what you're going through don't look
[18:48] at what you've been through but look at
[18:50] what the word said jesus said i am
[18:54] the resurrection in the life
[18:58] he that liveth and believing in me shall
[19:00] never die
[19:02] brother and sister there's no death
[19:05] in jesus
[19:07] amen praise god he said come to me
[19:10] amen and jesus wants to give you life
[19:14] and that you might have it more
[19:16] abundantly
[19:17] amen with jesus christ
[19:20] amen no matter how stink the situation
[19:23] is
[19:24] no matter how your sins are
[19:27] no matter what you've done
[19:30] or what you've been through
[19:32] our god is able
[19:36] all things are possible
[19:39] to them that would believe
[19:42] so
[19:45] i believe that martha was a believer
[19:49] amen i believe that she believed that
[19:52] jesus christ
[19:54] amen was the messiah and all that
[19:56] sometimes we we said we're christians
[19:59] and we believe
[20:01] she had enough confidence in him that if
[20:04] he had been there the brother would not
[20:07] have died
[20:09] amen but he's here now
[20:12] and your situation that seemed to be
[20:15] hopeless he's here now
[20:18] you might have thought that he showed up
[20:21] too late
[20:23] too late to change your situation
[20:27] but i said god amen still
[20:31] had
[20:32] control amen he can help you amen when
[20:37] it seems like it's too late
[20:41] somebody said he's an old time god
[20:44] oh yes he is
[20:47] so god is
[20:49] he's here right now
[20:52] this morning
[20:54] he's here now
[20:57] amen to give you
[20:59] praise god that oh god that if you did
[21:04] if you got enough faith not to give up
[21:08] if you got enough faith to believe that
[21:10] god
[21:11] in spite of all
[21:14] that is transpired in all that has
[21:17] happened
[21:18] if you have enough faith in god
[21:21] if you can only trust god this morning

[21:29] then god is able
[21:32] to give you victory this morning
[21:35] they give you amen that which you stand
[21:37] in need of this morning
[21:40] amen i believe that somebody they may
[21:43] have a need this morning
[21:45] and because you have a need this morning
[21:48] i believe that god is here this morning
[21:52] to give you amen praise god
[21:56] for
[21:56] deliverance
[21:58] victory
[22:00] in spite of how dark

[22:08] and he cannot fail you
[22:11] and he will not fail you
[22:14] he's not going to leave you in condition
[22:18] in that sad condition
[22:21] he saw the state of martha and mary and
[22:25] he saw the state amen the bible said
[22:28] jesus wept
[22:30] amen praise god but he he met praise god
[22:34] when he got there amen he knew amen that
[22:37] all things were possible
[22:40] he knew that he meant you don't have to
[22:44] stop believing now you don't have to
[22:46] give up right now
[22:49] amen because he's able
[22:53] to do the impossible
[22:56] i i wish somebody would trust god to go
[22:59] beyond amen what they can see what they
[23:02] can feel amen even what you can think
[23:07] amen just hold to god's unchanging
[23:10] hand
[23:12] because the word of god approved his own
[23:15] word
[23:16] he'll prove himself to be faithful
[23:20] to those that would only believe
[23:23] they'll find out that god will amen
[23:26] praise god give you
[23:28] amen and expect it in
[23:32] that god will do

[55:26] amen
[55:27] i love my pastor said right at the end
[55:29] of his sermon he said that we have to
[55:31] expect the unexpected amen and i think
[55:34] sometimes the problem with us and even
[55:36] including myself is that we try to take
[55:39] a supernatural god and try to make him
[55:43] natural amen but sometimes we have to
[55:45] expect that the supernatural god would
[55:48] do supernatural things
[55:50] in our lives amen situations may not
[55:53] turn out like how we want it to turn out
[55:55] but through a supernatural god god can
[55:57] take those natural things turn into
[56:00] supernatural things amen
