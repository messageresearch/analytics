[18:29] may god bless you read this word you may
[18:31] be seated
[18:35] god is good amen
[18:38] [Music]
[18:40] i said we're in perilous times when they
[19:52] in other words they have lost hope
[19:57] so when they lose hope they'll do they
[19:59] get in panic mode
[20:02] and when they get desperate they're
[20:04] doing
[20:06] reckless things
[20:10] and i believe that
[20:13] the world is getting ready to get
[20:18] reckless
[20:20] if something don't turn
[20:24] around with this pandemic
[20:29] they're talking about shutting down the
[20:30] country again
[20:35] brother and sister how much more
[20:39] can we stand
[20:43] how many more hurricanes how many more
[20:45] earthquakes how many more floods
[20:48] how much more can we stand
[20:54] can the economy yet stand
[20:59] with another shutdown
[21:03] can our bacon banking system can the
[21:05] hospitals
[21:07] take another crisis
[21:10] the emergency room
[21:15] the intensive care units
[21:19] can the first responders take much more
[21:22] than they're taking
[21:29] their part of the country is on fire
[21:36] we're suffering so many intensified
[21:40] blows
[21:43] so much is happening everywhere
[21:47] i said brothers and sisters time for us
[21:49] to get desperate
[21:54] we find that
[21:58] faith love is faith
[22:02] incentive
[22:08] without love amen
[22:13] faith amen cannot
[22:17] operate in its full capacity
[22:24] if you want god your faith to operate
[22:29] then you need god's love
[22:34] you need agape love
[22:39] and when you have love
[22:43] you can get your faith to act
[22:47] and to move
[22:51] but we find out because
[22:54] god's servant said it's not enough love
[23:02] we want god to do great things but they
[23:05] met the prophet god says is not enough
[23:07] love
[23:11] the people of god does not have enough
[23:14] love
[23:17] to get the faith to be moving
[23:22] brother and sister we need more love
[23:29] as i was praying and looking let's go to
[23:33] judges six
[23:34] for a moment we got to get desperate
[23:41] i believe gideon had come to a time that
[23:46] things was getting bad
[23:51] and he probably came to a place he
[23:53] didn't know
[23:54] how to deal with the situations
[23:58] brother and sister when we don't know
[24:01] what to do it's time
[24:03] to pray
[24:07] and he said the factual fervent
[24:10] prayer of a righteous man avail as much
[24:16] it's not enough to pray but the
[24:18] affection
[24:22] fearing prayer
[24:26] amen god is a god that can be touched by
[24:31] the feeling of our
[24:32] infirmities
[24:36] probably god oftentimes said when he
[24:38] praying for a sick person
[24:40] he has to feel sometimes he feels
[24:44] what a mother must be going through with
[24:47] the child is sick and
[24:49] dying
[24:52] and his compassion goes out
[25:00] that's him amen contacting
[25:05] the love for that child the love for
[25:08] that
[25:12] individual we don't pray
[25:14] like we ought to pray because we don't
[25:16] have the love
[25:18] for amen one another
[25:24] when you really love somebody amen
[25:27] you really stand in the gap
[25:32] the prophet said the love that we have
[25:35] for god that calls us
[25:37] amen to pray
[25:40] we'll pray for this nation we'll pray
[25:42] for this country
[25:43] we'll pray for one another
[25:47] if we got the love of god
[25:53] but we find ourselves void of praying
[25:57] especially affection forever you can't
[26:00] hardly get
[26:01] people to pray now
[26:05] oh yes they'll pray when it's too late
[26:09] their pray after the loved ones are gone
[26:15] but to get detriment now
[26:20] brother and sister what it's going to
[26:21] take for us to get desperate
[26:25] here let me just look at
[26:29] judges six here for a moment
[26:34] and the children are illegal did evil in
[26:36] the sight
[26:37] of the lord and the lord
[26:40] delivered them into the hands of
[26:43] millions
[26:44] seven years praise god
[26:52] the mid in and the hands of the midian
[26:55] prevailed against israel and because
[26:59] of the midianites the children of israel
[27:03] made them dens which
[27:06] are in the mountain and caves and
[27:09] strongholds
[27:12] praise god they were hiding they're
[27:14] scared
[27:16] brothers and sisters they were high and
[27:19] they were scared
[27:21] they were afraid
[27:26] and so it was when israel
[27:30] had sown that the million
[27:34] million knights came up and the
[27:37] amalekites
[27:38] and the children of the east even they
[27:42] came up against them
[27:44] and then count against them and
[27:47] destroyed the increase
[27:49] of the earth to thou come to gaza
[27:53] and left no substance for israel
[27:57] neither sheep nor ox nor ass
[28:01] for they came up with their cattle
[28:04] and their tents and they came
[28:07] as grasshoppers for multitudes
[28:12] for both they and their
[28:15] camels were without number and they were
[28:19] entered into the land to destroy it
[28:24] and israel was greatly impoverished
[28:28] because
[28:28] of the midianites and the children were
[28:32] illegal cried
[28:33] unto the lord and it came to pass
[28:37] when the children of ildra cried unto
[28:39] the lord
[28:40] because of dominion nights that the lord
[28:44] sent a prophet
[28:49] unto the children of israel which said
[28:51] unto them
[28:53] thus saith the lord god of israel
[28:56] i bought you up from egypt
[29:00] and brought you forth out of the house
[29:03] of bondage
[29:05] and i delivered you out of the hands of
[29:08] the egyptian
[29:10] and out of the hands of all that oppress
[29:14] you
[29:15] and raid them out before you
[29:18] and gave you their land
[29:22] and i say unto you i
[29:25] am the lord your god fear not
[29:28] the gods of the amorites and whose land
[29:32] ye dwell
[29:33] but ye have not obeyed my voice
[29:38] and there came an angel of the lord
[29:42] and set under the oak which was an
[29:46] offer that pertained it unto
[29:49] josh the
[29:53] azerite and the son of gideon
[29:58] and his son gideon thrust in wheat
[30:02] by the wine press to hide it from the
[30:05] midianites
[30:06] and the angel of the lord appeared to
[30:09] him
[30:10] said unto him the lord is with thee
[30:14] the mighty man of valor and gigan said
[30:18] unto him o my lord if the lord be with
[30:23] us why then is all this befall in
[30:26] us and where be all his
[30:30] miracles which our fathers told us
[30:33] of sin did not the lord bring
[30:37] us up from egypt
[30:41] but now the lord has forsaken us
[30:44] and delivered us into the hand of the
[30:48] midianites
[30:51] it's something to look at the condition
[30:54] of god's people
[30:57] god's people had come to a state
[31:01] that god had delivered them because they
[31:03] had done evil
[31:05] [Music]
[31:08] they had done evil in the sight of the
[31:10] lord
[31:12] and god had delivered him up into the
[31:15] hands of the midianites and the
[31:16] malachites and so
[31:18] forth children of the east
[31:23] sometimes we suffer because we have done
[31:27] evil
[31:27] in the sight of the lord
[31:31] some of our problems is not amen because
[31:34] we've been so
[31:35] good and because we have lived the way
[31:38] we ought to live
[31:42] sometimes we go through uh certain
[31:44] things because
[31:46] they meant the evil in which we've done
[31:52] but nevertheless god amen had given the
[31:56] they meant the uh million knights in the
[31:59] in the children of the east and a time
[32:03] period
[32:07] and i want to say when you began to cry
[32:11] to god
[32:13] and you began to lift up your voice in
[32:16] desperation and you began
[32:18] to get down to business with god
[32:21] and you began to talk it over with god
[32:24] god
[32:24] i need to get desperate
[32:30] i don't know about you but i'm not
[32:32] satisfied with my spiritual condition
[32:38] i believe that uh that i can get closer
[32:41] to
[32:42] god than i am
[32:46] see amen
[32:50] you look around and you can see what the
[32:52] media knights and the amalekites and
[32:55] the children of the east what they are
[32:56] doing to the children of israel
[33:01] i don't know amen if you have a
[33:06] million nights problems and amulet kites
[33:10] problems and amen i don't know if you
[33:12] have
[33:13] the children or the east amen that's
[33:15] trying to
[33:16] make you impoverished
[33:19] i don't know amen what kind uh uh
[33:22] of spirits amen because amen
[33:26] they dealt with the natural what we are
[33:28] dealing with spiritual things
[33:32] and i'm sure that those same demons that
[33:35] work on them and physical realm is
[33:38] working on the
[33:40] they met the church in the spirit
[33:43] those demons amen that you seem
[33:46] amen they meant to be afraid of
[33:50] and they seem to make you impoverished
[33:54] amen i want to tell you something
[33:56] brother
[33:57] a sister they meant that the million
[34:00] nights
[34:01] uh amen and not your problems
[34:06] the amalekites are not your problems
[34:11] the amalekites are not your problems
[34:14] and the children of east is not your
[34:16] problem
[34:18] but your main problem and your main
[34:21] enemy
[34:22] is yourself
[34:25] are you with me if you can recognize
[34:28] your real
[34:29] problem amen does not lie relax
[34:33] it's not from without it's from within
[34:39] many times we want to blame
[34:42] somebody else
[34:46] getting an even talked uh the angel
[34:49] called him a mighty man of ballard but
[34:53] he began to reply
[34:55] amen uh amen if uh god
[34:59] be with us then i want to know where
[35:02] is his miracles i want to know
[35:06] amen why are we going through
[35:09] what we're going through if god is with
[35:13] us then why amen are we
[35:17] impoverished amen i
[35:20] know amen that i believe in my heart
[35:25] that god has forsaken us
[35:28] i heard him say that look like god
[35:32] has forsook for sick forsaken us
[35:36] and forgot about us i believe
[35:39] sometimes people they may believe that
[35:42] god
[35:43] is gone somewhere
[35:46] when he promised that i'll never leave
[35:48] you
[35:49] and i never will forsake you
[35:52] amen but yet in his mind what he was
[35:56] confronted with he believed that god had
