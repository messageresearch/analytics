[25:14] all the glory the honor and the praise
[25:17] in jesus name we pray amen
[25:20] let us turn to look at exodus chapter 3.
[25:35] you gotta say man
[25:43] amen and it reads
[25:46] now moses he kept the flock of jephro
[25:50] his father-in-law the pre the priest of
[25:53] midian
[25:54] and he and he led the flock uh to the
[25:56] back side of the desert
[25:58] and came to the mountain of god even to
[26:00] horeb
[26:02] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[26:03] him in a flame of fire
[26:05] fire out of the midst of a bush and he
[26:08] looked and behold the bush burned with
[26:10] fire
[26:10] and the bush was not consumed and moses
[26:13] said i will now turn aside
[26:15] and see this great thing why the bush
[26:19] is not burnt and when the lord saw that
[26:22] he turned aside to see god called unto
[26:25] him out of the midst of the bush
[26:28] and said moses moses and he said here am
[26:31] i
[26:33] amen god had a blessing to the remnants
[26:36] of where it
[26:37] may be seated
[26:40] amen we'd like to speak on a little
[26:41] topic tonight
[26:44] of getting your attention
[26:48] amen in the scripture here in the book
[26:50] of exodus
[26:52] moses this is after the time and he had
[26:54] left
[26:55] run away from egypt left the king's
[26:57] palace
[26:58] and he got to the point in time he's on
[27:00] the back side of the
[27:01] desert heard and sheep
[27:05] all the time moses knew that he was a
[27:07] chosen vessel
[27:09] and that that the lord had called him to
[27:12] something special something great
[27:15] and he decided that one day he wanted to
[27:17] take it into his own hands
[27:20] and not and not follow god's plan
[27:24] so he got to the point he killed an
[27:26] egyptian so he had to run for his life
[27:29] he got on the back side of the desert
[27:31] and
[27:33] god said one day after after he had been
[27:35] through some trials and some tests in
[27:36] the desert
[27:37] he said i got to get his attention so he
[27:40] sent the burning bush but he didn't let
[27:42] it be consumed because he knew
[27:43] that's what he needed to get moses
[27:45] attention
[27:47] and moses turned aside and he said
[27:51] after the lord recognized that he he saw
[27:53] what was going on
[27:55] he said moses moses and moses answered
[27:57] here am i
[27:58] because he recognized that god was
[28:00] getting his attention
[28:01] all throughout the bible there are
[28:03] scriptures and stories about
[28:05] how god used different things to get
[28:07] people's attention
[28:09] and each person was different moses god
[28:12] knew that he needed to fight
[28:14] to show him that to get his attention
[28:18] let's turn to the um the book of first
[28:21] kings chapter 19.
[28:48] we'll start at the first nine
[28:58] at this time elijah he has
[29:02] jezebel is after elijah and it says in
[29:05] verse 9 he said he came
[29:07] he came through there into a cave and
[29:09] lodged there and behold
[29:11] the word of the lord came to him and he
[29:13] said unto elijah
[29:14] what dost thou hear elijah and he said
[29:18] i have been very jealous for the lord
[29:21] god of hosts
[29:22] for the children of israel have forsaken
[29:24] thy covenant thrown down on
[29:25] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[29:29] work with the sword
[29:31] and i even i only am left and they seek
[29:34] my life to take it away
[29:36] he said go forth and stand upon the
[29:38] mount before the lord
[29:40] and behold the lord passed by in a great
[29:42] and strong
[29:43] wind rent the mountain and break it
[29:47] in pieces the rocks before the lord but
[29:50] the lord was not in the wind
[29:52] and after the wind an earthquake but the
[29:55] lord was not in the earthquake
[29:56] and after the earthquake of fire but the
[29:59] lord was not in the fire
[30:01] and after a fire a still small voice
[30:04] and it was so when elijah heard it that
[30:06] he wrapped his face in his mantle and
[30:08] went out and stood in the entrance of
[30:10] the cave
[30:11] and behold there came a voice unto him
[30:13] and said
[30:14] what dost thou hear elijah now these are
[30:17] two different stories in the bible
[30:19] where god gets his servant's attention
[30:23] and the first one he used to use the
[30:25] burning bush
[30:26] and this one he used a small steel voice
[30:29] and in this one he test elijah
[30:31] he wanted to see if elijah was listening
[30:34] first he sent the wind then he sent the
[30:37] earthquake
[30:40] and then he said he sent the fire
[30:44] but god wasn't in those he was in a
[30:45] little small still voice
[30:48] and sometimes god does that even in our
[30:50] own lives to see whether we're paying
[30:52] attention
[30:54] and we ask the question some people ask
[30:55] the question how do you know it's the
[30:57] voice of god
[30:59] the answer to that question is that the
[31:02] message that you receive
[31:04] will be in line with the word of god you
[31:06] can always take it back to the word to
[31:08] fact check it as i say
[31:10] you can look back because the bible is
[31:11] your fact book it's your checkbook it's
[31:14] your guideline it's the thing that you
[31:15] can look back at
[31:16] and say let's just line up with the word
[31:19] of god
[31:20] the bible says try the spirit by the
[31:22] spirit amen
[31:24] amen so in here he uses
[31:27] he uses different things to grab their
[31:29] attention even in our own personal lives
[31:32] sometimes i tell people don't discredit
[31:35] the message because of the messenger
[31:37] so some of the best advice i got in my
[31:39] life one time
[31:40] came from a man that looked homeless he
[31:43] might not have been he could have been
[31:45] but he sent me a message that was a word
[31:48] that i knew was nothing but from god
[31:50] because he spoke into my life and he
[31:52] said he told me
[31:54] i was going through some things that he
[31:56] couldn't have known because i've never
[31:58] met him
[31:58] i've never seen him he wouldn't know
[32:00] what i was doing or what i was going
[32:02] through
[32:03] and he spoke a message and it was to get
[32:05] my attention
[32:06] now if i would have looked at him i
[32:08] never would have received
[32:09] or maybe even come to him to respond to
[32:12] him in the correct way
[32:14] because i'm looking on what i see not on
[32:16] what
[32:17] not on what he what the lord is trying
[32:19] to speak to me in this moment in this
[32:21] situation
[32:22] in this time god just recently took me
[32:25] through something and
[32:26] he used a child to send me a word
[32:30] he and i was looking at it and i was
[32:32] like now most people would have thought
[32:34] oh that's just a story or would have
[32:36] just passed it along
[32:38] but if you're listening to what god is
[32:40] trying to speak to you
[32:41] sometimes a children can speak a child
[32:44] can speak
[32:45] in the bible he is you have the yeah
[32:48] balaam in the donkey
[32:50] he used the donkey to speak to him it
[32:52] wasn't nothing great he used the animal
[32:54] and the prophet of god tells a story but
[32:57] in his life how opossum came to his
[32:59] house
[33:00] and he didn't know that god was trying
[33:03] the possum laid there for 24 hours sick
[33:06] and lame and he's god was trying to show
[33:08] that
[33:09] and show show others that it doesn't
[33:11] take something great
[33:13] it doesn't take like everybody doesn't
[33:15] have a paul experience on the road to
[33:17] damascus
[33:18] well lights shine from heaven everybody
[33:21] doesn't have what a donkey speaks to him
[33:23] but everyone god speaks to you in some
[33:25] way and he knows exactly how to get your
[33:27] attention
[33:28] he knows what it takes he knows how far
[33:31] to go
[33:32] and he always he said in his word he
[33:34] never put more on you
[33:35] than you could bear he always makes sure
[33:38] that in your time and in your season
[33:40] there's a word for you there's something
[33:42] there if you're going through trials and
[33:43] tribulation there's something
[33:45] a word of deliverance will come but you
[33:47] got to be expecting it
[33:49] you also got to be ready for each
[33:51] situation here
[33:53] god knew that moses was ready he had
[33:55] been through some trials he had been
[33:56] through some tests
[33:58] he had been through some tribulations
[33:59] but now he was ready
[34:02] he was prepared for the word that god
[34:04] was going to send him
[34:05] elijah he had run from jezebel he
[34:07] thought he was the only one
[34:09] lord i'm the only one left jesus but god
[34:12] showed him he had to speak to him and
[34:14] say
[34:14] no it's not you i got over 7 000
[34:17] that's still here serving me even in
[34:20] this time where
[34:21] we just stealing the pandemic and going
[34:23] through different things
[34:25] where they say the best way to defeat to
[34:28] to defeat an enemy
[34:29] is to the bottom is to separate them
[34:33] but if you're listening to what god is
[34:35] trying to
[34:36] say to you you'll never be off the word
[34:39] because god will just tell you what the
[34:40] word says
[34:41] he'll just send a message that it'll
[34:43] back it up with the scripture with the
[34:45] word
[34:46] so you can be in line and just if you
[34:49] have questions then you go back to the
[34:50] word and say lord
[34:52] i need you to show me because not
[34:53] everything is revealed to you
[34:55] straight off moses didn't know the plan
[34:57] that god had for his life
[34:59] he didn't know that god was gonna he was
[35:01] gonna have to
[35:02] sin run for his life go to the desert
[35:05] and then god was gonna bring him back as
[35:06] an old man to save god's people
[35:08] he thought while i'm young and strong
[35:10] i'd do this myself
[35:11] but he had to go through some things and
[35:14] go through some trials in life to end up
[35:17] to where he was able to save the
[35:18] children the children of israel
[35:21] god just used different things in life
[35:23] to get your attention
[35:25] if you were his child he said i've never
[35:27] lost one
[35:29] he never lose he'll never lose one so
[35:31] he'll always send things
[35:33] and you'll say lord why am i going
[35:35] through this
[35:36] lord why am i going through that and
[35:39] recently
[35:39] i had someone reach out to me and they
[35:41] said
[35:42] man why why do you think i
[35:46] you people go through certain things i
[35:48] said god sometimes
[35:49] takes you takes you through things
[35:53] to see what will your response be
[35:56] and sometimes he'll take you back
[35:58] through a similar situation
[36:00] to see have you learned your lesson yet
[36:03] he'll take you back around and say
[36:05] i guess you didn't have the right
[36:06] response yet he said
[36:09] brother branham spoke i suppose um told
[36:12] the story about sister hattie wright
[36:14] and he asked her what did you want what
[36:17] would you want and she said
[36:18] lord i want the salvation of my two sons
[36:21] he said that's the right answer
[36:24] he takes you through certain things to
[36:27] to see what your response will be
[36:28] because sometimes you think i made it
[36:30] over
[36:31] i've crossed over i shouldn't be dealing
[36:33] with this no more
[36:35] but then he'll bring it back and say let
[36:37] me see have you really overcome
[36:39] have you really gotten through and
[36:40] actually broke through or you just made
[36:42] it to the door
[36:43] and thought that you had made it and
[36:46] he uses different things to get your
[36:48] attention
[36:50] sometimes he says son daughter is trying
[36:52] to get closer to you
[36:53] let me let me do something to just you
[36:56] everything going well but let me do
[36:57] something to disturb it
[36:59] so that you can get closer to me he uses
[37:02] different things to get your attention
[37:05] as is many examples all throughout the
[37:08] bible
[37:09] where he just points out and he shows us
[37:12] that
[37:14] where he just even the story of david
[37:16] and bathsheba
[37:17] in the book of second samuel chapter 12
[37:20] he goes there and he says
[37:22] for this one to get david's attention he
[37:24] sent a prophet
[37:25] he sent nathan to tell him a story
[37:28] about the lamb the rich man who takes
[37:31] the poor man's
[37:32] he has plenty of sheep and everything
[37:34] and then he goes and he takes
[37:36] the lame man he takes his lamb the only
[37:39] thing that he has
[37:40] a and david gets upset and said say
[37:44] that man ought to be he needs to be
[37:47] punished
[37:49] and nathan turns around and says you are
[37:52] that man
[37:55] and david said he he is immediately
[37:58] sorrowful but it goes to point the bible
[38:02] says that david was a man after god's
[38:04] own heart
[38:05] and he still made mistakes he and he
[38:08] still was human
[38:10] even though he was a man after god's own
[38:12] heart god still had to use something he
[38:14] had to use his
[38:15] his servant to get his attention so we
[38:18] all
[38:19] but it's it's are you willing to
[38:21] recognize that god is speaking to you
[38:23] are you willing to recognize that
[38:27] first they said the only way to solve a
[38:29] problem first you got to admit that you
[38:31] have a problem
[38:32] you'll never solve a problem that you
[38:34] that you don't admit that that is there
[38:37] and so god uses different things to get
[38:40] your attention
[38:41] to send you a word in due season to tell
[38:44] you different things
[38:46] to speak to you he sends people he sends
[38:49] situations he sends circumstances in
[38:51] life
[38:52] that just point to you to show that
[38:54] sometimes you just need to get closer to
[38:56] him
[38:57] you just need to sometimes it's
[39:01] the message that you need to pray more
[39:03] you need to read your bible more
[39:05] i was listening to the prophet of god he
[39:06] said you can tell
[39:08] you can tell certain things about people
[39:11] by the things that they read
[39:13] and it he said i when i go to a house
[39:15] you can tell by the books that they have
[39:17] sitting
[39:18] on their bookshelf the different things
[39:21] about them
[39:22] he said i want to go by the person that
[39:23] has that has that bible right next to
[39:26] him
[39:26] that has the word of god that's you can
[39:28] tell that it's been read it's been worn
[39:31] pages are worn and it was just things
[39:34] that god was pointing out to me
[39:35] that sometimes he you he's using
[39:38] different things people in
[39:40] different situations to get my attention
[39:42] to speak to me to say
[39:44] this is time that we we all need to get
[39:46] closer to him
[39:48] because we because you never know what's
[39:50] coming what's on the path
[39:52] god is preparing you for a reason not
[39:54] just
[39:55] oh well i can wait why or
[39:58] i'm gonna have another chance because we
[40:00] don't know what if another pandemic hits
[40:03] and we not able to come together take
[40:06] advantage of the things that
[40:07] that god has given us in this space and
[40:09] time because you never know when you
[40:11] when the time is
[40:14] when your time is coming when things are
[40:16] coming
[40:18] that that time period the thing that god
[40:20] was trying to get your attention
[40:21] to prepare you for our opinion
[40:24] and you miss the opportunity god because
[40:27] before judgment god said he always sends
[40:29] a warning
[40:30] and he uses many things to get your
[40:33] attention
[40:33] whether it be people whether it be
[40:35] things where whatever it may be
[40:38] but you have to be ready and listen
[40:41] watching for the things that god says
[40:50] amen
[41:04] appreciate the word tonight getting your
[41:06] attention amen
[41:10] you know god is so good just sitting
[41:12] there thinking you know as he was
[41:13] ministering tonight
[41:15] you know he was saying some things that
[41:16] i was telling my wife
[41:18] before we came to service tonight i said
[41:20] you know uh
[41:22] like he was saying uh we can miss a lot
[41:24] of times what god is saying to us
[41:26] because of the messenger
[41:28] and i said a lot of times we do miss god
[41:30] we miss god all the time
[41:32] because god you know i was thinking i
[41:35] was telling my wife
[41:36] i says you know i was on my knees
[41:38] yesterday praying
[41:40] and i said lord you know because god can
[41:42] start showering you with blessings
[41:44] start doing all kinds of things in your
[41:46] life and
[41:48] spiritual things as well i was telling
[41:49] my wife some things i
[41:51] i said they'd be working with you all
[41:52] the time and i said but
[41:54] i was on my knees and i was praying i
[41:56] said lord
[41:58] i said no matter what happens in this
[41:59] life no matter what
[42:02] where i find myself no matter where you
[42:04] take me
[42:06] i said lord don't let me change but let
[42:08] me stay on my knees
[42:10] you know let me stay into the place to
[42:12] where i'm always
[42:14] depending on your grace i said no matter
[42:16] what happens because i was
[42:18] telling my wife i said you know a lot of
[42:20] people got destroyed
[42:22] because no doubt you know things started
[42:24] happening with them god maybe started
[42:26] blessing them
[42:27] but they were lifted up to their own
[42:28] destruction
[42:30] i says but you know one place i said
[42:33] lord no matter what happens
[42:35] i just want i want to stay to in a
[42:37] certain place of
[42:38] of all my needs and humility and
[42:41] reverence
[42:42] for god always understanding one thing
[42:45] that without him we ain't nothing you
[42:48] know that scripture came to my mind that
[42:50] i think it was psalm 8 he says when i
[42:52] consider the heavens
[42:54] and the work of thy hands what is a man
[42:57] that thou art mindful of him
[42:59] i said when we look around to what we
[43:00] got or what we can brag about
[43:02] i said consider the heavens and the work
[43:05] of god's hands and i said what is a man
[43:08] what are you capable of but nevertheless
[43:11] i says god is sovereign
[43:12] you know i was trying saying to myself i
[43:15] said lord you sovereign
[43:16] all by yourself you don't need no help
[43:19] when god want to bless you or god want
[43:20] to do things he don't need nobody's help
[43:23] he don't have to sit we get with counsel
[43:24] with nobody when god want to do
[43:26] something
[43:27] he can do it without no help come on
[43:30] i said god you sovereign i said we lo we
[43:33] we serve a sovereign god we serve a god
[43:36] that when he want to bless you can't
[43:38] nobody stop it you know i think about
[43:40] joseph and how
[43:42] you know god wanted to bless joseph
[43:44] nobody couldn't stop him
[43:45] put him in a pit put him here put him in
[43:47] jail come on but nevertheless god was
[43:49] gonna make room for him
[43:51] and i thank god i said all the time
[43:54] where are we at
[43:54] in life where are we we're god making
[43:57] room for us
[43:58] in the midst of the pandemic a lot of
[44:00] people lost their jobs
[44:02] a lot of people sick a lot of people
[44:03] lost a lot of things but god made room
[44:06] for us
[44:06] and i thank god for making room for us
[44:08] come on i thank god don't you thank god
[44:11] for making a way for you
[44:12] for opening doors for you doing things
[44:14] for you that you say lord
[44:16] i'm not even worthy of your blessings
[44:18] i'm not even worthy lord of what you
[44:20] or what you what you've given me and
[44:22] what you're doing in my life i ain't
[44:23] worthy of it lord
[44:25] i believe like jacob said lord i ain't
[44:27] worthy of the least of your mercies
[44:29] but nevertheless god is still pouring
[44:31] out his grace and his blessing
[44:33] i said lord don't let me change but let
[44:35] me stay on my knees let me stay
[44:36] worshiping you let me stay giving you
[44:38] glory
[44:39] stay given you praise god why because
[44:41] i'm here to do one thing and that's to
[44:43] worship you
[44:44] hallelujah you know i was ministering on
[44:48] sunday
[44:49] about what faith does and i was saying
[44:51] you know
[44:52] the lord made a statement he says and in
[44:55] the scriptures the bible says that
[44:57] when i return shall i find faith will he
[44:59] find faith when he returned
[45:01] because he knew that that would be the
[45:03] one thing
[45:04] that the people would lose he didn't say
[45:07] what i find big churches or or what i
[45:10] find
[45:11] faithful members and all that he says
[45:13] but when i find will i find faith when i
[45:15] return
[45:16] because you know i said as i was sharing
[45:18] with the church on sunday
[45:20] i said the thing is i says when a person
[45:23] is faithful going to church
[45:25] or faithful panic tithes or faithful in
[45:27] that aspect
[45:28] we say oh they're a believer but that's
[45:31] not what jesus said a believer was
[45:34] that that's the the misconception of
[45:37] what a believer is
[45:38] because they wear long dresses that's
[45:40] not a believer
[45:41] but he said that these signs shall
[45:44] follow them that believe
[45:46] he said in my name they'll cast out
[45:48] devils they'll speak with new tongues
[45:50] they'll take up serpents they'll do
[45:52] these things
[45:52] he said these signs shall follow them
[45:54] that believe i said that's a believer
[45:57] not just being an outward member like
[45:59] that i said but come on these signs are
[46:01] following
[46:01] the believers so i asked the question
[46:04] even sunday i said so are you a believer
[46:06] come on do you believe that jesus christ
[46:09] is the same yesterday today and forever
[46:11] do you believe the holy ghost is still
[46:13] real you believe god is still healing
[46:15] and delivering all this thing as time go
[46:17] on
[46:17] what happens what's happening as time go
[46:20] on people losing their faith
[46:22] people losing their their because they
[46:24] their concept of god was all messed up
[46:27] and so they losing that as time go on as
[46:31] time go on people like to say losing
[46:32] their religion all these things but what
[46:34] it is
[46:35] that just the more impossible it seemed
[46:38] that's the more that we starting to see
[46:40] god
[46:40] to do what he promised that he'll do
[46:42] come on how many believe that tonight
[46:44] i says you know you know god getting
[46:47] your attention
[46:48] thank the lord i said you know because
[46:50] what it is like a lot of times like i
[46:51] said we miss god
[46:52] we may god god do a lot of things but we
[46:55] miss it he speak to a lot of people but
[46:57] we miss it
[46:58] like brother caleb was saying tonight
[47:00] he's speaking through children
[47:01] he do it all the time and we miss it he
[47:03] speak to a homeless man and we miss it
[47:05] come on
[47:06] god uh veil coming back to to do
[47:09] something for
[47:10] us and and if we could only if we can
[47:12] only receive
[47:13] no matter where it comes from if we can
[47:15] only receive
[47:16] a word don't you don't you know how
[47:18] powerful a word from god is
[47:20] he said i sent my word and it's going to
[47:23] do what it accomplished
[47:24] he says i sent my i sent my word and it
[47:27] healed him come on you know how much
[47:28] power is in a word from god
[47:30] no matter who it came from if it's a
[47:32] word from god
[47:34] to receive that word it has the power to
[47:36] transform it has the power to create
[47:39] it has the power to heal it's going to
[47:41] accomplish the whatever god sent
[47:43] it to do no matter where it comes from
[47:45] if it's a word from the lord
[47:47] it's power in that word come on but if
[47:50] we allow the word just to sit dormant
[47:52] and don't take it come on and don't uh
[47:54] like mary
[47:55] pondered all these things in your heart
[47:57] then it won't do nothing for you
[47:58] come on it'll sit there you know you say
[48:01] a lot of people
[48:02] they believed and they didn't get healed
[48:04] they died come on that did not
[48:06] take away from god's word that did not
[48:08] take away god
[48:09] came to do a job he says uh the spirit
[48:12] of the lord
[48:13] is upon me because he hath anointed me
[48:16] to preach the gospel come on
[48:18] to the poor to heal the sick the broken
[48:20] heart and all he said they kept it free
[48:22] god he came to do a purpose and he
[48:24] didn't leave without accomplishing what
[48:26] he came to do
[48:27] it's still real no matter how many
[48:29] critics around it no matter how many
[48:30] people saying it ain't real it's still
[48:32] real come on
[48:33] god is still doing the same things he's
[48:35] been doing and we're still
[48:36] looking and depending on him as time
[48:38] goes on for him to still be real
[48:41] how many depending on him tonight i says
[48:43] but what it is a lot of times
[48:45] he's challenging your faith it's what
[48:47] he's doing
[48:48] you know i was thinking i said uh in in
[48:51] saint john 5 how
[48:52] the bible says that when the water was a
[48:54] certain season the water got troubled
[48:56] an angel would come down they believed
[48:59] that those people didn't have scripture
[49:01] on it
[49:01] but they believed that when the water
[49:04] was troubled you say why the water had
[49:05] to be troubled
[49:06] you think about you know the water
[49:08] you're rushing or whatever just trouble
[49:10] water look like if you sick or an
[49:12] ailment
[49:12] you wouldn't get in trouble water you
[49:14] wouldn't get in water like
[49:16] that but when you got faith come on when
[49:19] you when or when let's say when you
[49:20] desperate
[49:21] you'll do whatever to get your healing
[49:24] you know when you desperate like uh
[49:25] brother caleb was saying tonight god put
[49:27] us in places sometimes
[49:29] you know that like he did moses he put
[49:31] us in places sometime to get our
[49:33] attention
[49:33] or he backs us in a corner to where we
[49:36] have no other uh
[49:37] hope or salvation but him come on so i
[49:40] said that when that water was troubled
[49:41] no matter what ailment there was they
[49:43] was trying to get in
[49:44] because they believe that if i can just
[49:46] get in that water and i'm worried about
[49:48] whether i'm a swim drown
[49:49] all that but if i can get in that water
[49:52] come on my faith telling me that god is
[49:54] going to do something
[49:55] supernatural if i can get in that water
[49:56] come on and i says what it is your faith
[49:59] god you got it's something in you that
[50:02] you got to know
[50:03] that when you when you believe god you
[50:06] got to know that when you take hold to
[50:07] the word
[50:08] you got to know that when all that fails
[50:10] you holding on to the word
[50:12] it's your faith got to tell you that god
[50:14] he's still god he's going he going to
[50:16] handle the situation
[50:17] how many believe that tonight i said god
[50:19] will handle it for you if you only if
[50:21] you're only allowed
[50:22] that's that's my my uh challenge tonight
[50:26] is allow allow god to move in your life
[50:30] step back and let god be god
[50:33] step back and say god you i'ma let you
[50:36] come on
[50:37] i'm just here to worship you lord i'm
[50:39] i'm just gonna worship you
[50:41] i'm just gonna lift my hands you mind
[50:42] lifting your hands tonight say lord

[50:46] thank you for your grace lord and thank
[50:48] you for your mercy
[50:49] you said you're trying to work something
[50:51] up come on but ain't nobody trying to
[50:52] work nothing up
[50:53] come on it's something about god he
[50:55] comes down and he dwells in that
[50:57] when you worship the lord when you tell
[50:59] the lord thank you come on
[51:00] blessings will be outpoured you'll
[51:02] shower out his blessing his spirit

[54:47] understand the kingdom of god
[54:48] he cannot see it it takes
[54:52] the holy ghost to open your
[54:53] understanding to the kingdom of god
[54:58] there are some things that i was writing
[55:01] down today as i was praying
[55:04] and um
[55:08] and i was listening to the prophet today
[55:10] and he was saying
[55:12] some things and scripture tells us it
[55:14] reigns on the just
[55:15] and unjust reigns on the jets and unjust
[55:21] so the spirit of god when it comes down
[55:24] he said
[55:25] i'm gonna give those people that's
[55:28] believers i'm gonna
[55:29] let the rain fall in the church but it's
[55:32] only gonna fall on the believers
[55:35] but the rain falls on the just and the
[55:38] unjust
[55:40] when the rain falls on your naval garden
[55:45] you'll fall on and he'll fall on the
[55:48] wicket as well as
[55:51] god didn't sit in rain he said i'm just
[55:53] going to
[55:55] shower my reign on the good
[56:00] on the righteous but i'm gonna just end
[56:03] the unjust
[56:05] so many people that the anointing of god
[56:09] would be on their life
[56:14] but down in their soul they got to be
[56:17] seen
[56:21] sometimes people can have the anointing
[56:25] and have
[56:25] gifts and have gifts of healing miracles
[56:31] yet down in their soul they're wicked
[56:38] sometimes they're living in sin but yet
[56:40] they've got the gift
[56:41] of god the gifts and calling to god
[56:46] without repentance
[56:49] sometimes we're secured in what we have
[56:54] we're so secure in what we got
[56:59] and then we think we had his shoulder
[57:01] above everybody else
[57:05] but saul was head and shoulder above
[57:08] everybody
[57:09] in in israel but yeah
[57:13] it took david a little ruddy fella to
[57:16] face goliath
[57:20] brother ernest said uh caleb said
[57:24] david was a man after god's own heart
[57:27] it's what's in your heart
[57:30] what's in your heart and what
[57:34] god sometimes he's building us by giving
[57:37] us one experience after another
[57:39] experience
[57:41] your faith is growing your faith is
[57:43] built
[57:46] if god did this then he can do that
[57:50] amen and god can keep on moving
[57:54] if you just keep on believing
[57:57] the way god stop moving when you start
[58:00] doubting
[58:04] as we said on the other day faith knows
[58:06] no hindrance
[58:09] amen so if you've got faith in god
