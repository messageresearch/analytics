exalt who am also an elbow and a witness of the suffering of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed to neither as being large over God's heritage but being examples to the flock for likewise you're younger submit yourselves into the elders yea all of you of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resists the proud and giveth grace to the humble six cast all your cares upon Him for he cares for you amen whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same Affliction are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world ten together but God of all Grace who has called us into eternal glory by Christ Jesus after ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish you strengthen you and settle you God bless the research you may be seated thank God he sits but the God of all Grace who has called us amen the God of all Grace who has called us I'm so glad he called us how about you brother and sister you know I I I'm going through an exciting time in my life because his grace means so much to me you know and uh just to encourage you this morning because we all seem to be in this hour amen that we're going through different tests and different trials and tribulation but he says here after you've suffered a while after you've suffered a while praise God Hallelujah I believe it's very relevant to us today amen that we can identify with suffering I mean from every aspect I mean from one thing to another look like we're going through battles and things that amen just come our way we didn't accept hard to come and you didn't desire to come but he said after you suffered a while amen you know I I was thanking the lord for that fourth verse he said when the chief Shepherd shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory that faded not away uh I got all excited I guess I got to wanting to Run and Jump into everything because you know I wasn't looking at my suffering you know my mind wasn't on what I was going through my mind was on that Crown of Glory amen the Crown of Glory that faded not away amen see that's the Christian amen perspective of things they're looking at the Crown of Glory you know I I believe amen no matter how hard the taskmasters was over in Egypt I believe that the children of Israel had a promise from God and that promise was echoed for hundreds of years amen but it kept on echoing amen but it was one time that the promise of uh of God was drawn nine amen God promised that they would go sojourn in a Strange Land but after 400 years God was going to bring them out and it's going to take them back to the land that he promised to Abraham amen we call it the promised land amen they were under expectation but they had to suffer amen they had to go through some hard suffering brother and sisters for this Third Exodus before we leave here Amen on this Third Exodus he said after you've suffered a while amen God gonna amen we're going through some stuff but while we're going through some things here in this earth praise God hallelujah it's not compared to the glory that shall be revealed in US amen things are going on in our lives things are going on that we don't that are distasteful that we don't want to go on but they're going on but after you've suffered a while you know in second Peter 3 you know I like this it was one of my favorite scriptures uh when I was a young preacher and it still is amen he says in a second Peter 3 and 9 it says the Lord is not slight concerning his promises that some uh some men count slightness but his long-suffering to us who are not willing and then should perish but it all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements should melt with the fervent Heat and the Earth also in the works that are therein shall be burnt up amen men you know they're worrying about this Earth and worrying about this world but it's going to be burnt up praise God and a lot of times our suffering Amen in this life is is because of carnal and everything things but you got to get your mind off of these effortless things because amen you're gonna amen that's what caused a lot of other problems because our minds and our attention it's fashioned after the things of the Earth amen but you got to admit set your affection on things above amen you got to get your mind on Heaven I've got to leave this old Earthly house amen this whole world of trouble and sorrow praise God but he said it's going to be burnt up isn't that right these things go it's gonna be burnt up so why why get all uh just grinding you know somebody worried about amen this kind of money this that the other all kind of things that doesn't matter anyway what is getting ready to burn are you with me praise God hey you know look it's just the race of God and the mercy of God that he holding back the wrath of God oh you will be so I want you to understand that amen that you're suffering it's but uh uh for a moment it's just a little while after you've suffered a while amen but I don't want you to take your time to dwell on what you're going through and your problems in the situation I want you to take the time to you to look beyond what you're going through see job had to glip Beyond his conditioner amen he had to he had to look beyond what he was suffering in his flesh and he had to look amen now Jesus had not come in but he said I know that my redeemer live see what happens was he he had a promise in his heart that the Redeemer lived praise God now if he can look amen before Jesus had come amen and died on the cross and he said I know my redeem will live he had something that he could hold too he had a tadpoles an absolute
