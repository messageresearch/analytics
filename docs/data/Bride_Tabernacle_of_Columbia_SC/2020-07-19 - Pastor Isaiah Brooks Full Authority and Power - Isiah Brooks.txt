phone all you do is talk about the scripture in the Word of God and I told her where that's my life it's what I live with live by and live from and Jesus Christ is my champion this morning for those who are listening and you have not made Jesus Christ your choice the greatest thing you can do in this life does not make a million dollars or business the best choice that a man can make in this life

be here by the grace of God I want to be used by the Lord in any way he chooses to use me I'm nothing of myself everything that I am is because of the Lord Jesus we appreciate our pastor reeling in you're Simmons for allowing us to be here to entrust us to stand at the pulpit this morning we realize by God's grace I'm not worthy to stand before the desk but God has made me worthy not prolonging the time we want to get right into the Word of God I trusted them all will bless you this morning I know we're living in a crucial time we're living at a time where fear has gripped the hearts of many believers as well as non-believers but I hope some way and somehow that the Lord will bless you as we stand we going to ask you to turn with us amen to revelations to fifth chapter if you had a place where you can't stand you ought to stand in honor of the word as I when I'm at home I'll tell the people that no matter where you are you ought to be in church churches are a particular place like a local building but churches actually in your heart and wherever you are it ought to be a place of church but Christ could come and minister by God's grace and if you don't mind I'm just gonna take this jacket off being that it is outside and it's quite warm I trust that it's okay with you by God's grace you love the Lord amen coming from revelations to the fifth chapter we'll begin at the sixth verse and we'll read down to the eighth verse and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the to the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints amen one more scripture coming from revelations 10 we're living in a time as you turn we're living there at a time when God is doing some great things and I am so glad to be part of this drama amen the reason why I say it like that because I know the way the story ends amen revelations 10 beginning at the eighth verse and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went unto the angel and said unto Him give me a little book and he said to me take it and eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in that mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the right out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said it to be thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings one more scripture please if you don't mind turn with me quickly to Romans 8 we read the twenty ninth first twenty nine to the thirtieth for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate and he to be conformed to the image of the of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover who he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified let us pray Heavenly Father we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy you are our protector Lord we have no fear because perfect love has cast out the fear we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love divine we just pray father God that you have preeminence here this morning speak to our our heart speak to our lips give us Lord everything that the listener need hallelujah need to hear this morning anoint yoga so Lord through and through from the soul through the spirit to the flesh have thine own way have complete control this morning and will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated and those who are you cause you me by God's grace return into your house if you like we want to minister this morning the message full authority and power one thing I know is that God is a God of War he knows how to put us in a place where we must battle this battle that we're talking about is something that began before time we understand that Lucifer raised up against Christ in the beginning of time and we understand by God's grace that Micah Amen thought and overcame the dragon and right now we're living in a time where we are now coming to the culmination we're coming to the peak of this great event God against Satan intellectualism against faith we realize this morning that faith has always been the victory faith can move mountains faith can change situations that scientists say cannot be changed faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen faith is real faith is more real than sight it's more real than touch it's more real than any of our physical senses but only a few people knows how to exercise this faith when we talk about full authority that means that God has restored mankind this is what Calvary was all about you and I must realize by God's grace that there's something in a man that cries out and allows him to know that he's not what he desire to be there's something about him that he knows that he's not supposed to be in bondage he's not supposed to be enslaved he is supposed to be a ruler God made Adam a ruler he ruled the garden he he was lord over the garden but after he fell we felt fell we have now fallen into this horrifying state no real man enjoy being a sinner no real man a woman enjoy being controlled by something a man that he cannot control himself we love freedom and you and I must understand that God is doing something great we look at the coronavirus and everything that is going on and we understand how people are afraid and we understand how things are happening and people are dying but people die every day and we realize they men that there's something that God is trying to do father believer God never brings a challenge to a believer and not take the challenge when we're talking about people we must understand and I love to preach but I realize I'm limited for time and but but there is a covenant people there's a people here today that is protected by God we understand something that others don't understand I was thinking about the book of Revelation and I understand that there are so many different interpretations of Revelation men of intellectual minds have truly messed it up because everybody is looking for these great beasts and these great monsters to come and they fail to see that will not just in the book of Revelation but we're almost at the end of it many things have already occurred hallelujah people talk about the mark of the beast and the mark of the beast have been going on for thousands of years people talking about these great things that are happening but they fail to see amen we're in between the second woe and the third woe the first war was the world war one hallelujah the second woe was world war two we're right in between the second row and the third row in other words would you believe what you're saying right in between in other words we are at the time of a rapture but you and I must understand it is it is at the time when people will relax is when God comes you know I have never seen it like this before where the whole world has been shut down by what we call virus I'm recalling the time amen when all the leads that was shut down by plagues and viruses but during that time instead of being covered by a facemask they had to make sure they were covered by the blood because jesus said when I see the blood I pass over you and the blood still lives the life of the blood which is Jesus Christ himself we're at a time it meant that this time has given unto you the pride of Jesus Christ to make sure that the blood the token life has been applied to your life hallelujah I rest in the name of Jesus Christ what we need to do is learn how to turn on your faith button can I say it like that God pushes you into a corner he makes you fight hallelujah even when you don't want to fight God will make you fight because he wants to bring out the warrior that's in you you and I Amen don't remember but when Lucifer came to a place to overthrow Christ we were with Christ then and we'll with Christ now you and I must understand that will not just natural beings but with supernatural beings hallelujah with a supernatural faith hallelujah with the supernatural God and God if he's supernatural he was supernatural yesterday he's supernatural today hallelujah and he will ever be supernatural y'all believe that I asked my question I asked my church I said which one would you rather stand and fight would you rather be like Daniel in the lion's den or would you rather be Amen like the Hebrew boys in the fiery furnace or would you rather span in Nero's chopping block or would you rather face Pharaoh and his army which one of these that you would fear hallelujah which one of these man that you were run from the challenge I want to tell you there are men of God there are women of God who stands for God who fights for God and they become victorious when the enemy comes in like a flood the Bible says that the Lord will lift up a standard against the devil I don't know about you but God has made me a standard oh by the grace of God I wear my mask when I need to but let me say it like this my mask is not protecting me it's the blood of Jesus it's my faith in God that's what protects me hallelujah we're at a time a meant that God is calling names who will fight for me if we must understand that we're in a great battle let me move on because I've got a jump you and I know that by God's grace that the very seals of God a revelation has already been open and when those seals were open in this day we realized that it gave man complete authority it brought him back to the full authority that Adam once had before the fall amen and God is looking for somebody whose faith can be quick so much so that they realize that it's not in other words it's not him that will it know he that run it but God who shows mercy he understands him and that God amen has placed him in this particular time and age to testify that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's not an organization he's not a denomination hallelujah but he is a manifested son and daughter of God you and I must understand Amen that if God be for us who can be against us hallelujah I must say that again we must realize that if God be for us who can be against us hallelujah the Bible said no evil so can i that dwelling place I'm just a fool to believe that no evil shall come nigh magged well in place is that right the Bible said that the angel of the Lord in kappa by those that fear him Oh glory to God hallelujah is that Alright that same Word of God said that there is a fire that encompassed me I've got a wall of fire about me somebody told me said don't you go over there to Arizona it's a hot spot don't you go down to South Carolina because there's a hot spot hallelujah but I told the devil understand this devil I'm a hot spot hallelujah ha ha because I've got eternal fire only inside hallelujah I've seen the eyes of the blind open I've seen the dead raise I've seen cancer healed I'm a victim I was a victim of cancer and God healed me hallelujah I've seen God deliver from high blood pressure I've seen God delivered from the by diabetes I've seen and do it and that same God lives today and I'm here to tell you the same God that lives today has given me the Holy Ghost and the Bible said after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you you shall receive power that power is Authority God has given us authority over the devil God listen let me say like this we've had several people not in my particular church but have been caught with Corona hallelujah and we prayed hallelujah and God delivered oh yes I'm a witness that God can defeat Corona hallelujah call it call it nineteen whatever you want to call it but there is no demon in hell that is able to overcome Jesus hallelujah because when God God's for your sins in my sins and when he wrote the decision and go with it to hell realize the day Corona was there hallelujah and my god car a Concord Corona Kovac and whatever else the devil is sending this way God is a vicar we are not to fear hallelujah we have the authority but we need to learn how to turn on faith and open up our mouth hallelujah the sword of God is in your mouth not just in your head the sword of God is in your mouth hallelujah is that right the Bible says you can say to a mountain be thou move and it shall be done I don't know about you but I'm not afraid of the darkness let me say like that again I'm not afraid of the darkness why because I know a man who could turn on the light hallelujah I know someone a man who could take the darkness and disperse it in a moment's time you see I'm not like Moses Moses forgot just in a moment time what God was doing and when the enemy came in under him like a flood y'all better hear me this morning because some of us ought to be a shame of ourselves hallelujah i'ma say it again some of us ought to be ashamed of ourselves some of us haven't even come to church in a long time since Coby came because you're afraid you ought to be ashamed of yourself and call yourself Christian oh god I hope I'm knocking on your door this morning hallelujah you ought to be ashamed of yourself God is God and how you'll never how will you ever know he's real if you don't see God work in your life do you know faith need the experience hallelujah somebody help me faith need the challenge hallelujah you'll never know what you got until your challenge David played his harp day by day but when the lion came he was challenged hallelujah David knew that himself he could not defeat the lion but he knew the God who could and the lion was delivered in his hands he continued to play and a bear came his way David a boy even knew he could not defeat the bear on your own you can't couldn't defeat Corona but we know the God who can hallelujah they said they're coming another way that's the way come because I've been told by the prophet of God that every wave I will crash I'll know by God's grace that I am born a victor I know by God's grace I've been born a conqueror even so that Paul said we're more than conquerors through Christ Jesus somebody help me here you see we're not afraid we're the Church of the Living God onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before hallelujah I've got the cross of Jesus in the front of me I've got the cross of Jesus in back of me he's my buckler he's my sword he's my shield he's my helmet hallelujah he's my all and all hallelujah god shoot up stand up he wants us amen to be bold and brave hallelujah y'all hear me he wants us to be bold and brave I'm not saying I'm not fighting in my flesh people I'm fighting in my spirit and in my soul hallelujah I don't take vaccinations hallelujah they got a one coming and I before I knew all of these things God told me whatever you do don't take it don't take the fascination I don't know what it has all in it but that's what God told me before they even talked about a vasa nation before they even said anything about being the first wave or secondly God Himself spoke to me in my prayer and said this is the first wave and there's coming another hallelujah but there's some people that same God is my protection he's my sword he's my shield hallelujah somebody help me here but a lot of us amen we're afraid of things but Paul said I am persuaded neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus I know that many of us are fearful otherwise God wouldn't be preaching this I can almost feel it coming my way you are insane brother Brooks I guess I am hallelujah but this is the way I preach at my church and by God's grace not one person in our church has ever had it that we know of you understand me we're moving to perfection now a lot of times people perfect people think that perfection a man is not doing anything wrong perfect perfection is when you willing to give God your perfect will he you make his will your perfect will you understand me Abraham was considered perfect because he was willing to give his perfect his will to God's perfect will that's what makes you perfect not your dues and your don'ts it's his will that you are interested in more than anything y'all hear what I'm saying let me hear let me say that again a lot of us think well if I just walk in a straight jacket I'm gonna be all right with God that's not it that's why Jesus said that in the garden of God sibling he said Lord not my will but thine be done what was it yield and your will to his will is what makes you perfect hallelujah God be helpless help me Lord God has always been supernatural might say that again I'm saying these things because you and I must understand we're rapturing material you must be tried you must be tested I remember the other day let me say it like that I had a situation that came upon me and I remember the scripture says perfect love casts out fear and I remember the fear coming upon me but all of a sudden it disappeared because I prayed I don't know whether I told that testimony or not but I was on the plane and the plane was losing pressure it was getting ready to crash the stewardess had flight attendants they were afraid and I said to the Lord Lord you didn't tell me I was going to die today but I wasn't you know for a moment I really I really I was so afraid I I couldn't even catch my breath and I heard something say perfect love casts out fear and all of a sudden fear left but the thing that I noticed was that I wasn't the one that cast it out it was perfect love it was God himself on the scene he got rid of the fear for me y'all hear what I'm saying it's just like the bees and in the bone it was God who got rid of the fear when God gets rid of fear faith and love steps here hallelujah you know what I'm saying Amen Daniel Amen didn't get rid of his fear it was God who got rid of Daniels fear Daniel would not have been able to face the lion Shadrach Meshach and Abednego would not have been able to face the fiery furnace hallelujah y'all understand me even David would not have been able to face Goliath on his own but we have a God and this God is perfect love who is Jesus Christ it is God who came to his rescue that ride it was God who stepped into the fiery furnace it was God the envelop of God that we worship today he always comes on the scene hallelujah you don't have to worry about nothing telling somebody I said what's going to happen just build a place there and our homeless got saved and I was telling brother we don't know maybe we'll come to that for it's all over but I don't fear it why because I have a word that my god supplies all my knees God would supply all your knees y'all hear me he surprised the children of Israel water in the desert he supplied the children of Israel with bread and meat in the desert he's the same God hallelujah he's a pride a man Elijah with fish with bread meat and bread hallelujah and if God can do that then he can do it now somebody help me he's the same God that turned water into wine hallelujah he's the same God that walked on the waters hallelujah he's the same God that raises men and women from the dead he's a saying today hallelujah we have full authority is that right he said after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power if you got the Holy Ghost you need to cut on your faith button hallelujah turn on your supernatural know what you possess hallelujah this ain't no runnin time is fighting time y'all hear what I'm sayin it's not running time is fighting time I'll do it I won't cop - no I told somebody said you know myself I just want to hear well done hallelujah he put me in this layer to see an age he put me in a time when he news this is Corona and everything else was gonna come my way hallelujah oh come on somebody who's Oh God scientists oh Jesus Christ it's science amen is that ruling the world right now but I want you to understand my God can heal man here here a man if he's got no education he doesn't have to be a doctor to forgot to hear his prayer he could be the most simplest man in the world but God I hear on his heart he are here a sincere prayer hallelujah I believe that with all my heart you need to put together and put together some other things wanted to minister but anyway we must understand by God's grace if I can remind you of one thing is that if you got the Holy Ghost you got Authority hallelujah I'm not saying that some of you will get touched by this devil because many of us we catch a flu we don't think it's so cursor thing when the flu come some catch measles mumps whatever demons but all alone we battle with those demons we cast those demons off that's why we come to church people come with headaches we cast those demons out people come with flus and colds we cast those demons out hallelujah understand the same thing with this devil that's a plague in the country you can cast him out yonder stoutheart have mercy yonder said what did this world do before this corona is so bad what did it do Satan in his smart schemes put such a fear on everybody it gripped the world not just the United States it gripped the world cuz a lot of to all of you catch that you're going to die that's been alive from the beginning it all depends on who you are Oh somebody help me here you and I must realize that I tell you what I can feel that hardness that you have I can't convince you if the world if the Word of God can't convince you of God ain't real in your solar I'm sorry I I'm sorry that he's not real in your soul that you feel like God can't whip the corona hallelujah you said what some saints died from it some saints have died from the flu some saints died from the heart attack was it the curse then hallelujah you're gonna die somehow Oh somebody help me here you and I must realize hey men that's one thing I know if I don't know nothing else I know that Jesus Christ is God and he's never lost his power the blood of Jesus had never lost his power and we're always I'm telling you what I'm looking for Reviver I'm looking for God to do something with these people this is our this is our our and this is the day of full authority this is the day that God gonna use his people to show the devil who's boss hallelujah and I am so glad to be in the number you love the Lord I can continue but I'm not I just want to drop a word of encouragement to you this morning I want you to understand the law you know it who where's the real church where is the real church where is the real Bride of Christ where is she hallelujah we want to see the real Bride of Christ stand up come out of a closet come out we are the time that the devil is say oh he's laughing at you like Goliath did the children of Israel see if your old faith is intellectual like theirs was a man you gonna bunch up in a crowd of fear hallelujah but there was a young boy by the name of David said ah I've had some tests I've got some testimonies I know God is real hallelujah like God we destroyed that cancer demon in me when he destroyed the high blood pressure demon in me when God destroyed the diabetes demons I mean he can destroy any other demon as well he's still God hallelujah yes people are afraid and you know what I went out on the street and I went witness and the Lord brought one soul to the Lord I mean the man was not only praising God he called me yesterday last night and he was crying when it came to the Lord I told the pastor where I was I said I hadn't seen that in a long time where a man or a woman was repenting and crying before the Lord I haven't seen it in years if I could say it can't even get the believers to cry and break down in front of God but he was a man who broke down in front of God sayings of God I don't know where you are people of God sent a man whoever you are I want you to understand today that God is more than able but you need a place of refuge that's right Noah had a place of refuge and that was in the ark Moses them had a place of refuge and that was under the blood the people today has place of refuge and that refuge is in the name of Jesus Christ baptized in his name filled with His Holy Ghost hallelujah that is the only hiding place it's gonna catch the whole world and everything that's coming that has not yet come if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's coming and it's going to knock on your door I pray that you would flee to safety find yourself in Jesus Christ and then God will fill you with this Holy Ghost and then you will no longer be a coward but you have the authority of God working in you you love the Lord without God I could be nothing without God I surely without God [Music] like the scene with a horse a without God I be nothing Oh without God Hatchin [Applause] [Music] oh just like a scene with I see
