by the power of the Holy Ghost and father I pray that you move upon your word today Hallelujah that you meet every need in Jesus name amen amen we're in Philippians 4 and 5 Philippians 4 and 5 as we were talking about uh death and life is in the power of the tongue we want to talk uh this morning about the Battleground this week we were just you know meditating upon that the Battleground as the prophet of God says in message the greatest battle ever fought is fought in our minds amen so we're dealing with the Battleground Philippians 4 and 5 he said let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is what at hand at hand be be careful for nothing but in everything by what pray and with Thanksgiving let your God be known to God amen Amen Let the Peace of God which passes what all understanding shall what keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus said it'll keep your what hearts and Minds it'll keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus amen right amen okay he says finally my brethren whatsoever things are what true and whatsoever things are what honest and whatsoever things are just and whatsoever things pure and whatsoever things are what lovely and whatsoever things are what good report if there be any what virtue if there be any what praise praise what think on these things Shake somebody hand and tell them think on these [Music] things amen when you're thinking on these things he says those things which ye have both learned and receive and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be what with you he'll be with you God bless you you may be seated and the God of Peace shall be with you amen amen amen the brigh of ground think on these things amen amen because we're dealing with now you might say what is the Battleground we understand that the Battle Ground has changed it used to be that uh people will fight battles in the jungles or somewhat in a in no man's land where people didn't dwell and uh the different uh enemies would come and their fight and sometimes they they would have you know back in the Bible Babylon would build a wall and maybe they have water and everything and there it be fortified Behind the Walls and so forth and now we find that uh the modern day uh battles we had Wars in Vietnam and different places and look like they fought in the jungles and so forth and sometimes they went to The Villages and all of that but now we having what we call Urban Warfare and uh we find over in Ukraine and the you know in different places the hospitals are being bombed the cities are being bombed neighborhoods are being bombed and everywhere so the Ware has taking a different route people have to battle the enemy and they have to go from house to house and so forth like that so the Battleground has changed there's no set place where the batt is going to be in a r remember when David was facing a Goliath they they met in the valley and uh the Philistines was on other side and the israels was on one side and they fought to fight the battle they had a a Battle Ground to fight on Fight to go to war in and um we tried to keep it out of the people that wasn't fighting but now you know the Battleground the people may not be uh soldiers or may not be fighting but the war is taken into the city okay so by the grace of God the Battleground that we're talking about is the Mind amen the mind we were saying in Mullins the other night uh we were still dealing with uh death and life is in the power of the tongue and I said to them you got the what you got the power are you with me you have the what power death and life is in the power of the tongue amen now you can speak what you can speak life or you can speak death you got the power death and life is in the power of what tongue you got the power are you with me you have the power amen Shake somebody hand and tell them you got the power you got the power amen what you say if you would say to the mountain if you would say it you got the power are you with me you have the power to speak it amen and to have what you say Amen but you got the power amen you got to believe what you say Amen and then you speak it but if you don't believe it you won't say it you got the power tell somebody again you have the power you have the power amen you have the power yes Amen to speak to word amen spoken word is the orig the seed brother friended you have the power amen so the Battleground we're talking about is in the mind and the greatest battle ever fought it's going to be fought in your mind especially in this age amen especially in this age so um Proverbs 23 and7 you know I I was I was thinking the Lord as I was uh meditating and studying and uh sometimes you you know you run and and get your commentary and I would just send thank you Lord because he was saying this scripture is here and this scripture is there and this scripture is here I said Thank You Lord because so sometime you think you're getting a little old and you're slipping you know you can't quite catch it and I said I was enjoying the Lord because he was saying here it is and then I turned there I said okay uh 23 and 7 it says uh for as he what think in his heart so is he isn't that right so uh sometimes you know you your thoughts mean something because it's your mind now we're talking about control tower let's let us just say control tower control tower now your control tower is your mind the mind is going to control the rest of you are you with me amen control tower okay so if they're fighting for control of your mind now who's fighting the forces from beneath and the forces from above God and Satan are fighting amen good and evil are fighting amen and they're fighting for control of your mind are you with me amen so who's going to win the battle who's going to win the battle this morning is it going to be God or is it going to be Satan who's going to win amen so he says as a man what heart think it in his heart so is he now remember I said you got the what power you have the power you have the power death in life is in the power of the what don't you know you cannot speak it until you can get it in your thought pattern amen amen you have to think it before you speak it because if you're speaking and don't think it amen it's got to come from somewhere amen amen a word before it becomes a word is a what thought a thought so you got to think it before no matter how fast it comes amen amen you it's got to be a thought before it becomes a word amen and remember that you and I was thoughts in the mind of God before the foundation of the world he it in seed form in germ seed form you were thought in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and God saw you by full knowledge he was seeing the end from the beginning because he's God Amen and he forew you yes amen he knew what you were going to go through before you ever went through it but God has made a way of Escape for you that he forne amen amen are you with me amen so you must know that God has it all in control amen not a control towel now the devil is trying with all his imps and all his demon power to come and bombard you you know sometimes we say the children they they it it it it's got so much coming at them that the children uh uh don't know how to handle it everything is moving so quick and so fast and the mind just can't get it together and sometimes people are are wondering why amen the children are acting like they're acting because they it's so much pressure on them amen amen because we're competing against the whole world so it's it's test after test and this because you God is giving each and every one of you a measure amen amen amen some of us it doesn't we go to our capacity then we still couldn't be but a see student and some of us can go to our capacity and as the world look at it we'll be failures at our best we'll still be a failure but in God's sight amen you might look like a failure God has uh hid it from the wise and The Prudent but reveals himself to babes amen amen in God's sight the world can put you on a certain level and put you in a certain place but God can have you at another whole place because he he don't judge amen he said your ways are not my ways and your thoughts are not my thoughts amen and how man Jud St God don't look at that amen God look at your heart are you with me man CH the outward appearance amen those that man call intelligent God might call him dumb God are you with me he said God has made foolishness the wisdom of the what world so the things that God would call a man would call ohoo she's intelligent oh he uhuh so God might call that foolishness amen and the things that foolish God might call it wise amen are you with me see because uh a man looks at things different the way God looks at things so don't you as you think as a man think it in his heart you sometimes you condemn your own self and you speak words that defeat your own purpose amen and you live defeated life because of what you speak but before you spoken you receive in your mind a thought amen and in your mind you receive a demon of defeat the Devil will never cause you Amen to uh praise and to lift up God and to than good thoughts amen the devil intention you remember we said in the in in Genesis in the days of no every imagination and thought of man's heart was continently what evil evil is't that right so their imagination the way they thought was evil the whole world was like that amen and the Bible tells us as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of lot thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen so at this particular Age We Come Back back to that kind of time amen that our Battleground every imagination and thought of men's Hearts amen so let let us look at ourselves what kind of world we're living in we're living in a world that promotes everything that's ungodly am and the prophet of God said this is Satan eating we're living in a world that Satan has amen not that he he he could create but he has perverted amen amen he has perverted everything amen and as we were doing the Sunday school this morning he said the man has taken the iron out the Earth he taken the the Brad everything that that would hold this uh Earth together man has uh uh made cities and bridges and buildings and taken all the the structure stuff that's going to hold the Earth together man has went in there and take it took it all out now the world is falling what part now we got all these earthquakes we got the S we got everything is going and even the ocean itself is being stripped of all this resources are you with me so we so what is what is it we we on sinking sand the Earth don't have nothing to hold it up amen and now what has happened to man man has been so corrupted by the intelligence of Satan and Satan eeden man has been so corrupted by Satan that amen it's become so wicked some people said if we vote this way we're voting for our rights to do what we want with our body amen but the Bible tells us that our body is the Temple of the what Holy Ghost Holy Ghost ain't that right now it's was not what are we believing as a man thinketh in his heart now what are what are we what are we allow to control us is he said that the words of my mouth and what meditation the meditation of my heart be acceptable and what thy sight oh Lord I want God thoughts amen yes Lord Philippians 2 said let this mind what be be in you that was also in who Christ Jesus so I want the mind of Jesus Christ the Battleground we in a war we are fighting a war the battle amen and I'm saying amen you can't lose not with ran I stuff he used Reverend Ike y some of y'all children don't know who Reverend ik is he said you can't lose with the stuff I use but you can't lose with the word of God Amen because you are more than what conquers in him that what love you amen we ain't using no stuff it's the word of God amen amen and the word of God is powerful amen amen I I was reading this morning he said forever oh Lord Thy word is settled in heaven amen amen are you with me amen we got a word amen we got a sure Foundation we got a word that we can stand on and we know that we'll win us we know that we're more than conquer we know that we'll win this battle oh God hallelujah oh yes there's no temptation taking you but such is common to man but God will with the Temptation make a way of escap of Escape amen praise God hallelujah amen but he said how should we escape and we nect so great a Salvation amen this salvation was was oh hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah don't let this thing slip amen don't let the word of God slip amen praise God don't you let the word of God slip amen hold fast to the word amen amen the world can do what they want say what they want take what they want but I'm holding on to God's unchanging hand the words is going to stand having it out to pass away but God wor to be there amen hold to God's unchanging hand ain't God good hallelujah amen the book as a man think it in his heart Jeremiah 17:9 Jeremiah 17 and9 the Lord is good amen amen his Mercy is Everlasting amen amen as he think it the Battleground he said the hard is what don't you know you can't trust your own heart amen if your heart is think something contrary to the word then you let that thought go amen amen if your heart say well I I I I know what the Bible say but I I don't believe it in my heart your heart is deceitful amen amen you can't go but as a man think it in his heart if Satan can sow seeds of unbelief in the in the ground amen you remember uh Jesus said a soul went forth to so seed and some fell upon thy ground some found about good gr and so forth but another thing he says amen he he he saw that uh wheat in a field and then he saw tears in the field amen and when uh wheat and tears grew up together he said where did the ter come from he only sold good seed he said the enemy sewn that seed so when you see Terrors come up in your life don't you think that God sold that seed amen he said the enemy sold that seed amen sometime we blame God for what God didn't do the devil did that amen amen when it's evil it didn't come from God Amen when it's a lie it come from the Devil he's the father of Lies amen amen where did he get it from he got it from s amen are you with me amen so what happens the enemy so I God s the kingdom of God and and his angels went forth and it so good seed but the devil come behind and he so what you remember most of the time amen when the good thought come to you the evil thought Falls amen amen amen and you say well uh and then you get it h what where am I the good thought usually amen is the first thought the next thought is the evil thought and then you better which one I'm going to choose amen amen your action shows which one and what you speak amen amen what you surrender to amen he said to whom you yield your members to amen that's who you're going to be servants to obey amen what you going to yield them to God Amen into righteousness or you going to yield it to the devil amen the control tower he's trying to control your mind am amen praise God he's trying to get possession of your mind where he can get your body to do what he wants and he use your body amen for his the devil amen when he cast out he said hey if you going to cast us out suff us to go into the swine I need a body to go into amen and and Jesus said go amen and he ran he got in the swine and he run and the swine went crazy amen they went ran and and drowned themselves a't that right are you with me so that just shows you if the devil can possess the man that was bound in chain and had lost his mind amen the Devils amen said he said Jesus said what's your name he said my name is Legion because we are what many many I often times tell a story about the young man uh I think he was probably a teenager and was no biger and then uh Moses and the Moses Center amen but he was picking up people like little Tony stand up but he could pick he can pick he can pick them the demons hide him he can pick them up they try to hold him down he'll pick him up and he was in church and he was full of the devil and when we said pray he went to calling on Lucifer and all you can see is the foing out of his mouth and his eyes had been turned white and I we probably had double the many people we got here in the church full love with people because the church was smaller and I said I looked at him and I said just he was calling on Lucifer wide open and loud and he wasn't too much older than you Moses and your size but those construction workers couldn't hold him you know how many of you anybody here was there can she you was there I don't know but anyway he was picking them up and I said y'all go in the back cuz we had back y'all y'all take those children in the back amen and when I said take the children in the back you know what happened everybody was taking their children in the back they didn't have no children everybody was running the whole church is running I said y'all get back in here and get on that then start praying and then we had to door on the side like I said open that door and when I said open that door and we I walk down there and we pray and I put usually you put your hand on the people head and something I don't know something said put your hand on his stomach it's like a rock and I told the devil to get out amen and the devil left him amen am amen are you with me amen and when the devil left him uh I told the people to come on back and he was when they come back he was lifting his hand and praising the Lord and uh everybody saw that and the young lady she was there and she had bought her two sons and she had a nightclub and she said she's going to her car and she turn around and she say I saw God and I saw the devil tonight she said will you baptize me in Jesus Christ name I serve the [Music] Lord and and that's what you know God that is a devil people saying ain't no God that's a devil ain't it amen if there a devil there must be a god somewhere are you with me amen so oh Lord but anyway uh we want to look at the picture the heart is decea above all things and desperately wicked am man I just doing what is in my heart come on Amen except you were born again that's it except you were born again amen your heart is going to deceive you he said be not deceive so whatsoever Man soul that shall he re reap isn't that right so if you're not born again if you don't have the Holy Spirit you don't have the Holy Ghost you will be deceived amen the Bible talks about the a mark of the beast he said he receiveth all that dwell upon the Earth rich and poor born and free to receive a mark in their forehead are in their hand they receive the mark of the beast is't that right so by uh uh I'm getting too I'm I'm giving too much let me just close and shorten it brother we we're fighting battles every one of us are fighting battles in our mind there not one individual in here is not fighting a battle in their mind the devil would have you to think that you have a a serious problem that nobody else got it but you everybody got the same problem amen amen amen it's that you have to recognize that we are in a battle and the devil is trying to control Our Lives amen are you with me amen but ain't nobody going through what I'm going through nobody know you got your individual battle but we got the something to fight the devil with amen amen amen amen for for we said the weapons of our Warfare go go go there 2 Corinthians uh 10 and know that we are fighting a battle isn't that right amen amen but he said think on these things if you want Victory you better to think right stop letting your mind Wonder Amen in no man's land amen but take on these things amen amen amen you got to know what you suppos to be thinking amen follow my brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever Things Are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good report and whatsoever amen if they'll being a virtue if they're being in Praise what think on these things think on these things ain't that right amen see we thinking on the wrong stuff and that's the results we're getting because of the stuff that we allow ourselves to be thinking on Amen you

it's it it's glory that God wants to reveal it's blessings that God wants you to receive but you got to get your mind condition for it amen I was telling the Sunday school class back when in the 50s uh you know uh I'm probably about 3 years old and my mama was saying I we was going across town and catching the bus and I went to sit down in the front that probably about 55 so yall said I would even think about being born at 55 I sat down in the front of the bus and uh they said mama said get up boy cuz he couldn't set in the front of the bus you had to go to the bike the back of the bus I said I never could get it out my mind why Mama wouldn't let me sit and I see it in the front of the bus cuz that that got to me in my mind at 3 years old wow couldn't set nothing that was for the white people the black people had to set in the bik are you with me so I it's the condition we were conditioned to to to to think a certain way to conduct our lives a certain way because Society has
