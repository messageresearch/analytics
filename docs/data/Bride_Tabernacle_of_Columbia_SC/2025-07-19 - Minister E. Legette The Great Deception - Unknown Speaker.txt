Heavenly Father, Lord, we come to you this evening, Lord, as humble as we know how. Oh God, we know that the times, oh God, are hard and weary, Lord, so much, oh God, bereavement in the land. But God, I pray, oh Lord, that you would comfort those that are in bereavement today. And oh God, that you would give faith and wisdom. Lord, I just thank you for blessing us to be able to come to your house tonight, Lord. and God to be able to look to you, Lord, and call upon your name, God. You know, sometimes the flesh is weak, Lord, but we know the spirit is willing, God, we just pray you continue to bless your children. Bless those that are here, Lord. Bless those that desire to come but couldn't make it. Father, Lord, I pray, oh God, you bless those that are listening in, Lord. And, oh God, your people all over the world. Surely, God, we need a word from you, Lord. We need leadership and direction. Oh God, we need your spirit, God, that it'll give us confidence and boldness, oh God, to meet the challenge of the hour. For I know you will, Lord, because you said that when the enemy come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against them. And God, we thank you tonight for lifting up the standard. Thank you, God, for giving us that extra auction, oh God, to be able to press our way through. Father, we thank you, Lord, and we love you. We appreciate you with all our hearts. We ask if you said we said any done anything that ain't like you. I pray God you forgive us tonight. And oh God that you would help us oh Lord to be reconciled to you and be better better Christians Lord. Lord we just thank you Lord tonight. Bless your children. Move in a mighty way. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. We want to look at the book of Matthew by the grace of God. Matthew 3. Matthew 3 and we'll be at the first verse. If you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is he that was spoke that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his path straight." And the same John had his raignment of camel&lt;unk&gt;s hair and a leather gird about his loins and his meat was locust and wild honey. Then went out to him Jerusalem went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around Jordan and were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and the scribes come to his baptism, he said unto them, "Oh generation of vipers, who have warned you to flee the from the wrath to come, bring forth therefore fruits meat uh for repentance? And think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our father. For I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which bringeth uh not forth good fruit is heuned down and cast into the fire. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. But he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. May God bless the reading of his word. Tonight, just for a moment, by the grace of God, I want to minister on the great deception. Amen. on the great deception here, you know, uh reading in the scriptures. I was this just came to my heart uh the other week and I says, you know, John, John himself here, he had to set the record straight. Amen. He had to set the record straight and telling the people that especially the Pharisees and the scribes when they came out, he began to ask them, "Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" But he says, you know, because he knew what was in their hearts. He knew that their attitude and their their their pious ways, I guess, and he began to say to them, you know, is just paraphrasing it, don't take comfort in saying that we have Abraham our father because that that's that alone ain't going to save you or that alone ain't getting you into the kingdom. Can I say it that way? He says, "So don't take no comfort in that." He says, but he says you got to bring forth fruits meat of repentance. Right? And so John, like it says, he set the record straight even to as then as I believe the Holy Ghost wants to set the record straight even in the hour that we live in that it's a great deception going out. And I call it the great deception because many times people believe that just because you affiliated with a certain organization or you're affiliated with a certain group or your your daddy is is the pastor or the preacher or whatever it might be that that gives you some type of entitlement. But that's a great deception. You know, you got to come by the way of the cross. You got to come by the way of repentance just like everybody else did. I mean, just like everybody else has, you know, like one thing the prophet of God was bringing out about Mary and and how, you know, the Bible saying when they went in the upper room and Mary, the mother of Jesus, was with him, right? Because she wasn't even exempt from a born again experience just by her saying that, you know, I'm the mother of I had Jesus, all that, that wasn't enough. She still had God still had to come down and fill her with the Holy Ghost. So, it's a great deception going out and people are satisfied just being affiliated with a church or satisfied just being affiliated with a group, right? But like I said, that's a great deception. It doesn't when you when it's when it's uh when you come to God, it's you and God alone. &gt;&gt; It's not you and mom and daddy or you and friends or you and the pastor or you and whoever, whatever great man you tied to. You got to see Christ for yourself. &gt;&gt; Come on. And you got to But what it is I says that you know uh uh John here preaching and the thing is John knew that his ministry was to only get the people ready for the Messiah when he come. So he be to tell them you know yes but his his message was repentance. It's he says repent right even to the Pharisees and the sto those he told him the ashes laid where at the root of the tree come on God don't got no respect of person but his message to them was to repent because the kingdom of heaven is at hand but he also begin to let them know you know uh just just looking at it from a broad perspective you know he he he says he he he set the record he says that um it's one coming after me I'm just baptizing you the water, right? He says, "I'm just getting your hearts prepared, but the one that's coming after me, that's the one that you need to to get to." Not not me. He says, "So, you know, you had many that even after that that time would still follow John, but John clearly told him, I'm just baptizing you with water. I'm just getting your hearts ready." But when he come, he says, "I'm not I'm not even worthy to un loosen his shoes, the latch on his shoes." He says, "And he's the one that's going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire." But even though people might have had great respect for John, and even Jesus said himself that there was no greater man born of a woman than John the Baptist, but what John saw himself as is as I'm not even worthy. Come on. He says when when Jesus come, he says, "You come unto me, but I need to be baptized of you." But Jesus told him, "But it cometh to fulfill all righteousness." But what it is, you know, and that's like I said from John himself, it it it's he had to set the record straight. It's me. It's everybody. It's no matter who it is, you got to meet Christ. You got to go to Christ for yourself. &gt;&gt; How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; But it's a great deception. I said that because you know uh uh in the first the first when you the road to eternal life, when you first get on that road, that's that's the road of repentance. You can't even start the journey without repenting. Come on. Many people think they can start the journey. They just come and oh, just join church. That's what I was talking about the other day. I was talking about some ideology and things. I was saying, you know, cuz I was talking to brother Damon is who it was. And I and we were talking about some situations and I said, "See, you know, you know why we can uh we can uh love God the way we do or we can depend on trust God the way we do because it was God that brought us out." Because we realized that the shape that we were in, it was nothing. Nobody talked to you and conformed you and tried to say, "Hey, you just need to come or you just need it was nothing. Hey, man, you might as well just come on to church." No, none of that. It was that you came to a place in your life &gt;&gt; to where God opened your eyes &gt;&gt; to let you know what kind of shape you were in. &gt;&gt; You might have thought I ain't bad as this next man, but when God opened your eyes and let you see that sin is sin. &gt;&gt; Come on. No big sin, little sin. We know some things is abomination and all and but sin is sin, right? &gt;&gt; And you come in the world that way. So God got to open your eyes and and and show you. And I said, "That's what it was. God opened our eyes, showed us how filthy we were." So it wasn't that you were coming to church cuz you just wanted to felt safety in the comfort of the church because you never could feel that. You had to know that God did something in your life that even if they close the church doors down today, I'm all right because God is living in my soul. Come on. &gt;&gt; And that's where the people have missed it at. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's where people miss it from the young to the old might got gifts of the spirit might have this and that and they think oh affiliated with the message of the hour or whatever they might say or whatever organization of church but as I was saying on Sunday the scriptures he declared he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? Not when you believed. Yes you can believe. Many believed and came out and got baptized of John. But John let them know this ain't where it stops at. &gt;&gt; Come on. After this one coming that's going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost, right? In fire. &gt;&gt; And that fire going to come to burn all the sin out your life. That fire going to come to burn all the desires out your life. That fire going to come to take away your will. And then you'll be to the place to where you say, "Lord, I I'm not even worried about my own motives and objectives. I just want to do whatever you ask me to do, God." And you got to be willing to do that. Right? And the thing is, you might trick the preacher. You might trick others, but you can't trick God because God is going to try you. If you say, "God, I'll go all the way." He going to try you on those bases. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He'll try you on those bases. But I thank God that he does because all the trying and all of my failures, God just let me know I got to get that much deeper in them. God let you know through your failures, hey, that you ain't there yet. You got to go a little bit deeper. Come on. I got to do a little more in your life. And that's what it's about. But what it is, people want they they want salvation without change. Right? They think they get in the kingdom without without a born again experience. But when even Nicodemus, Jesus told him, he said, "You must be born again." &gt;&gt; Come on. It don't matter who you've been taught under. Don't matter how how how schooled and wellchooled you is, how perfect and righteous you might think you are, you must be born again. &gt;&gt; Come on. He gave Peter the keys. But he told Peter also, he he he says that um Peter, I prayed for you. Yeah. That your faith fail you not. He says, "But when you when you convert it, right? Not when you shout, not when you whatever you wanted to say, but when you converted, then you'll better strengthen your brothers. You can't get nobody strength when you ain't converted." Come on. Cuz you still need strength yourself. But I found I says, you know, one thing about Peter, I believe that when when Jesus was telling him that night, this will be the last time I eat and drink with you. He says, he says, cuz I'm going to be struck and she going to be scattered and all and everybody said, "We won't leave you." And but Peter began to say, "Lord, I will never deny you. I'll never leave you." Right? And I believe that he meant that in his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that. He meant it in his heart. He said, "If I forsake you, I won't go." Right? But Jesus Jesus told him before the uh crow uh three times tonight, he said, "You'll deny that you even know me." Right? Why did he deny him? Because he didn't have the power to help him get through that trial. &gt;&gt; Come on. And know you might mean it in your heart, but if if the spirit of God ain't in your life, when that trial come, one of those hard trials, you'll turn around. &gt;&gt; Come on. And I believe that Peter even felt bad because the Bible says he ran out and wept bitterly after that, didn't he? But he couldn't help but to deny him. He couldn't help but in fear to turn around because he didn't have that boldness of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He didn't have what it took. &gt;&gt; And that's what it is. But after the day of Pentecost, he had what it took, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. After that upper room experience, then he can stand. They say, "Peter, didn't you deny him?" Yeah, I might have denied him because I was afraid. I didn't have what I got now. Hallelujah. He says, "But you know this is that which was spoken of by the prophets." Come on. And then he began to speak boldly and all. And then throughout all his life, he would, you know, him and especially Paul would talk about how I'm a prisoner of the Lord, how I'm the least of all brethren, how I ain't nothing without God. Right? So what it is, you know, that's that's the that's when you know a man has gotten in contact with God when he sees himself as nothing. But you find people that that still walk think, oh, they they with a false humility, walking saying this and that. But you can tell by their speech. They speech betray them. That they ain't been in that presence yet. Come on. But once you go in the presence of God like Moses, he went in that presence. Hallelujah. And God to tell them, I'mma send you. But Moses said, Lord, who am I? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh? I can't. He saw himself so as insufficient. But it was the truth because he was 80 years old. He was weak now. Right? So he saw himself as that. And that's what God see when God comes in your life when real conviction set in. Come on. You'll see yourself as God. I ain't nothing. I don't matter how smart I am, how well-dressed I am, who my family is. God, I need your help. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need you to save me. &gt;&gt; And I don't need to just come to church, but God, I need the Holy Ghost. I need the quickening power because there's going to be some storms that come, some trials that come, and I'm afraid of them. &gt;&gt; Come on. Like Jacob, he knew that he had to meet Esau that next day. &gt;&gt; So what he did when he knew he had to meet Esau, he wasn't just satisfied. Come on, with nothing. But he said, "I ain't going to let you go till you bless me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I got a trial tomorrow. I got a hard trial tomorrow. And I'm afraid of Esau. I don't know what he going to do. But God, I know I need a blessing. &gt;&gt; Come on. And I ain't going to let you go. I'mma rustle. My hip get out of joint, I'm still going to wrestle. If my arm broke, I'mma still rustle. No matter how tired I am, I'mma rustle. When I can't wrestle no more, I'mma hold on to your garment. You can kick me, try to shake me off, but I ain't going to let go until you bless me, &gt;&gt; Until I get what I need from you. &gt;&gt; We need people like that today. Hallelujah. that ain't satisfied with just coming to church, but they said, "God, I want change in my life. Lord, I need help because I know that if you don't help me, I might have turned the leaf, but tomorrow I'll be right back where I came from or the next year or the next year." But God when God comes in your soul and he's sitting on a throne of your heart, come what may, mama leave, daddy leave, children, husband, wife, whatever might go. Job failure, you out there all alone. &gt;&gt; And the devil even might tell you that God ain't ain't with you. And look at how you doing for God and he done left you. But when he's sitting on the throne of your heart, something will rise up and say that he'll never leave you nor forsake me. He's still here right now. Devil, I don't care what you say. I don't care what you putting on my life. It don't matter. I'mma wait until my change come. I'm going wait until God show up because I know he'll show up. How I know he'll show up because he promised in his word that he would. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And that's what we need today. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what's missing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Just good church. happy, playing, singing. Where is the change? &gt;&gt; Come on. We need change. Hallelujah. We need sinners to come to repentance. &gt;&gt; It was like John the Baptist when he came out, he had a message from God. And his message was God was repent because the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Whether you're a Pharisee, whether you're a scribe, whether you're a Sadducee, don't think yourself, oh, I'm in this church. I go, come on. that God can take these stones up. &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't think the church running just because you here, you leave tomorrow, God will fill it right back up. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because he don't got no respective person. God used whoever he want to use. But I'm glad tonight that God thought about using me. Hallelujah. Oh, a person that wasn't nobody. Person that wasn't nothing. But I'm so glad that God thought about me. Hallelujah. And I want to walk before God. Whether it's just holding the door, whether it's just praying for the sick, whether it's just standing in the gap, whatever it is, it's a great thing to be in the kingdom of God. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. But it's a great deception. Come on. &gt;&gt; Today, come on. It's a great deception. But the thing about it is people will find out one day that what they had didn't work. You'll find out one day. Right. Samson depended on his strength most of the time cuz he gave God his strength, but he gave the lil his heart, didn't he? Come on. &gt;&gt; He depended on just because I'm a Nazarite, just because I'm this and it it might have been true, right? But he was playing with the devil, wasn't he? when he was up there. I always think about how the scripture says he was when he was up there with Delilah, she had men in the chamber lying in wait at at the time that she called him to come bind him. He up there playing around, but it's devils waiting to come get you. And that's what people think today. I'm a Nazerite. I go to church. I'm That's So, but you playing around. Come on. It's only the grace of God that nothing ain't bad ain't happen yet. It's only the grace of God that you ain't fall off yet. Right? But while you playing around, the devil got demons in reserve. All he's waiting on is the God to move his hand off your life. All he's waiting on is the grace to leave. And then he'll come bind you up. He'll take you to depths that you thought you'll never go. He'll take your mind. Come on. He'll take your body. &gt;&gt; He'll destroy your whole life, put you on drugs because the devil don't care nothing about you. All he come to do is kill, &gt;&gt; steal, and destroy. That's all. &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord. &gt;&gt; But Samson went out and say, "I shake myself as other times." But he ain't know that God wasn't with him, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. He wasn't ready for the challenge at that hour, was he? &gt;&gt; Come on. But to get back to it, what did he have to do? Find his way down that lonely road of repentance. &gt;&gt; Come on. He had to find his way down that lonely road. Said, "How's a lonely road?" Cuz I ain't even got my eyes this time. Come on. I'm a man weak. Can't get around. They had a little little lad leading them around. Right. Come on. But even though he had his eyes, I believe he still had tears flowing some kind of way because what got him was the memories, right, of the anointing. the memories of how God used to use them, right? And that ought to get somebody today. If you ever been in the presence of God and the power, the memories ought to get you. &gt;&gt; When you when you just get relaxed and cold, the memories out to do something to you to shake you and say, "Lord, I once more strengthen me again. Come on. Once more send your anointing, Lord. I don't want to just be a regular person. God, a regular church. Just paraphrasing. I don't want to be that. But God is is no, he just a regular church. But what made the difference was when the anointing was there &gt;&gt; when he can reach back and fill those locks &gt;&gt; and God would confirm the covenant that he made with him. Hallelujah. And the anointing come and nothing couldn't stand before him. Right? And that's how it is today. He said, "Upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't stand against her." Reason why things are going on. Come on. You got to What are you standing on? What are you built on? &gt;&gt; Come on. What What's your rock? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What's your rock? &gt;&gt; I believe Brother K was preaching on a rock. I listened to him the other day. What's your rock? &gt;&gt; What are you standing on? Come on. And that's the truth. What are you standing on? Because if it's anything else besides the word of God, it's shifting sand. &gt;&gt; If you building on anything else outside of the word of God, come on. We was preaching the other week. He says the rains came, the winds blew, the floods descended. You might make it through the rains. You might make it through the winds. You might make it through the floods, but when the earthquake come, come on. I want something that that'll take me through everything. &gt;&gt; Come on. I want something that's going to take me through all the storms. Might see that storm coming. Hallelujah. Might feel like I all the storm is coming. I wish it wouldn't come. But nevertheless, that's what God raised us up for. Hallelujah. That's why he prepared us for that's why we've been in prayer. That's why we've been consecrating for times like these. Hallelujah. That's why we got oil in our in our lamp and in our vessel because in the midnight hour for time we we we do that for the midnight hour. Hallelujah. So when you got to go out and fight, you can see your way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can see my way through this trial. I can see my way through this situation. I can see my way through this crisis. Come on. Because of the oil. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on. But I say it's a great great deception. you know that we find today I says but what it is and that's the thing uh uh uh Jesus like was saying even when Jesus came and his message was he says the spirit of the lord is upon me cuz he anointed me to preach the gospel but then after that he says repent because the kingdom of heaven is at hand right John the baptist not John the Baptist but Peter on the day of Pentecost they said men and brethren what shall we do what was his first message repent right come on and be baptized in the name of the Lord of Jesus Christ for remissioning your sins and then it didn't stop there though. People think that's where it stopped. That's not where it stopped. That's not the resting place. Come on. But but he said you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not nothing that you got to work for, but it's a promise that God gave you. Hallelujah. It's a promise, ain't it? Come on. But it's a great deception. People thinking that if I work to work, they might not say it from their lips, but their very action, the way they move in their life, they think they got some entitlement. Come on. But that ain't works like that ain't going to entitle you. You got to have representation by predestination anyway. Come on. But what it is, the Holy Ghost got to come down and strike the seed. That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Something got to click in your heart. Something got to change on the inside. &gt;&gt; You got to hear the voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say, did you hear it? Nobody heard. I heard a voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it said, "Come out of her." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. But what it is, because we my wife was telling me the other day about something and I says, you know, when it dealing with the church, right? I said, you know, all these Protestant churches and things, they came out of the of the Catholic church, right? At some point, you know, we was talking about mystery Babylon a little bit and and and the great the mother. Come on. She's the mother, right? The mother of harlot. She had daughters, right? And those harlots is going to do the same thing their mama did, right? From the very beginning. They might not, but just like after had to do the same thing her mama did, right? Because that's she did the same thing her mama did. Went after and and ba worship and all those things, right? Persecuting the people of God. And even though the the churches might have came out even uh I I can't say say it the way I want to say it but they come out do all the right things but I want to say one thing about it. It's still the spirit lingering around there. Come on. And if you don't watch it you can't help it. They can't help it but to set themselves up right and to do the same thing that the mama did. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; They got You see that? And the thing about it is I was I was telling Charlotte when we was talking about something I said we can see it so clear, right? Only reason why is cuz God opened our eyes. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's people that's affiliated with the same word and they can't see it. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's not that you understand it intellectually, but God, you know, the Pharisees and all that, they had the scrolls, the scribe, I mean, uh, the scrolls, they had the, they knew the prophecies of old. They knew what was to come, right? But when they asked John, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness." He was the word made flesh at that time, standing before him, say, "How was he the word made flesh?" Cuz he was the living word. He was the He was the scriptures that come alive standing before them. the prophecy that was to come. But even though they had the scrolls, even though they might have preached it, even though they might have quoted it when it stood before them, they still couldn't see it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it came exactly how the Bible said it would have came, &gt;&gt; right? And it's the same thing today. Right. That woman at the well, she saw more than all the Pharisees did. Right? Because she knew the scriptures. We know when the Messiah come, he'll do these things, right? He told her how he because they were she were looking for something. But then her eyes was open, wasn't it? Those on the way to Emmas, Jesus was talking, walking with them, they didn't know who he was, did they? But but but it was something about what he was preaching to them. Hallelujah. It was something about what he was teaching them that caused a burning in their hearts. Right? They said, "Did not our hearts do what?" burn in us. The word when it's preached effectively, it ought to burn in somebody's heart. It ought to cause somebody to be searching theirelves and say, "Lord, I need it. God, I want it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. It ought to burn in their hearts. But it says, "Didn't our hearts burn within us?" But the thing is, even though they they were they knew the scriptures and all that, but still took God opening their eyes, right? When they got in the house, he asked for bread. He did something. And the Bible says, "And when they eyes were open, right? Come on. People can be affiliated with the church, but your eyes got to be opened." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Your eyes got to be open. &gt;&gt; Come on. He that has an ear, let him hear. Right? If you got eyes, you need to see. But the only thing that's going to give you the ability to hear is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Nothing else. &gt;&gt; I don't care how smart you is intellectual, you can't hear without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that tonight? It's the truth. What does when the Holy Ghost come in, he is a lifecher. &gt;&gt; Come on. You ain't got to worry about that person no more. He cleaning them up. &gt;&gt; You preach the word conviction setting in. They conforming to what they hear. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Holy Ghost inside of them. &gt;&gt; He's changing me from glory to glory. He's changing me. He's working on me in the morning. He's working on me every day. Hallelujah. I thank God for working on us. Chip away, God. Shape me, God. Make me, God. Mold me. Change me to what you want me to be. Is that what you want tonight? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I was talking, brother Damon. I was talking about some things. I said, man, you know, is is it hurt your heart because uh see a person or whatever been doing that same thing for 30 years, right? They still come to church faithfully, still do this, that faithfully, but could have been 30 years, right? Something or But what it is, come on. Change got to come. &gt;&gt; But if you're sold to an ideology, you think you're all right. All have seen it come short of the glory. That's your comfort zone, right? I don't want to settle with that. Hallelujah. I want to settle with God. You said, "Be ye perfect as your father in heaven is also perfect." Right? Come on. I know we've all sinned, but God, I'm on my knees asking you to help me. &gt;&gt; Change me. &gt;&gt; Fill me again. &gt;&gt; Set me on fire again. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If I'm drifting, send something out there to bring me back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That ought to be your cry from the pull pit to the back. No, &gt;&gt; that's the truth. &gt;&gt; From the top to the bottom. &gt;&gt; But when you're sold to some ideology, your soul this is all right. You don't need Come on. Jesus told them by your traditions, you made the word of God effect to the people. &gt;&gt; Come on. You robbed the power from the people. You took away from the people the thing that was going to clean them up. &gt;&gt; You took away the hope from the people by your traditions. &gt;&gt; Come on. Who bewitched you? Hallelujah. But the Holy Ghost come back to give us hope. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. When he shines the light, you see the darkness then or you see exactly the condition you in. That's what we need today. How many believe that tonight? Come on. But it's a great deception, right? I says what it is. You know, God God's calling. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; But I know one thing. Like the scripture says, "Straight is the gate and narrowest way." Right? I was talking with a friend of mine last night and and uh he been he been going through some things at work for a couple last couple days and uh a certain situation, but he's real he's real religious, right? and real religious. But I told him I says that situation I says you know what that person want to make peace with you. that person want to make peace with you because they came and they acknowledge their faults but they can't approach you but they come to me and say hey cuz I helped them resolve some issues before and I talked to the person I said now you're the religious one I shouldn't have to talk to you about forgiveness right shouldn't have to talk to you about it don't matter if they did you wrong I shouldn't have to talk to you about forgiveness, right? Or about love or making things right. I said, "You go home and pray. Pray about it today and we'll talk tomorrow." But he came back the next day with a worse attitude than they need the first day. And I said, "See, that's what it is." You know, a lot of people in church are the same way. They'll jump. They'll shout. They profess the Lord, profess their Holy Ghost fil, but they'll hold something. They don't want nothing to do with people. They want nothing to do with them like that. Well, I want to say you can't get in the kingdom of God that way. &gt;&gt; Come on. Cuz if you don't forgive, you won't be forgiven. &gt;&gt; But you don't know how they did me. They ain't did you no worse than they did Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They ain't did you no worse than that. Come on. But if the Holy Ghost is in you, that's what it is. If you if it's just regular church for you, you can do that. But I don't know. I says I says, you know, that's what it is. He's got to something's got to change you. You know, you've got to be changed and then it won't be a struggle, right? Things might catch you unaware, but the Holy Ghost inside you, he knows how to calm you on down. &gt;&gt; Come on. He knows how to bring you back to reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost knows how to humble you down &gt;&gt; and then let you know, look, you out of place. &gt;&gt; Come on. You need to repent. &gt;&gt; You need to say, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; You need to make it right. Quit blaming everybody else. The Holy Ghost know how to do that. &gt;&gt; Come on. But you got to listen. You You got to listen. You I don't Come on. But I was I was saying me and another friend of mine was talking. I said the thing about it is when when you hold stuff like that, you got high blood pressure, you got heart issues, you really a sick individual, right? But look at the stuff you holding. You let that stuff go and live in the liberty of God. You might feel better. &gt;&gt; Come on. I know you will feel better. &gt;&gt; I know you will. But long as you've got that there, you get you you left a gate open for the enemy to come in. Right. And I I was saying, you know, uh in closing, I was saying uh uh Joshua knows they they can look back at all the great victories they won and the power they knew that that God was all powerful. And the blessed thing was when Moses was gone, the scriptures, God come to Joshua and said, "Moses, my servant is dead." But God ain't dead. He's still here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He used Moses in a mighty way. &gt;&gt; But he told him Moses is what? Dead. Right. He says, "But as I was with Moses," come on. So I'm going to be with who? You. Come on. But I want you to walk in my ways. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you do," he said, "It won't be a man to be able to stand before you. Every place the soul of your foot uh tread upon, I'mma give to you. It's yours." Right? But when they got the the the a uh AI right and they flew they flee before the Lord. I mean, flee before the people, right? I see Joshua and them going and crying and praying, Lord, what's going on? Cuz I know you all powerful. All the victories you won and we come against this small group. That's why we didn't send but a few people out there and they chased us. God, what's wrong? But God, it was nothing wrong with him. Right? I was just paraphrasing it. He said, "You left the gate open, didn't you? and the enemy come in and and they can't both sit on the throne at the same time. So I I I I I'll be right here waiting for you to get in repentance. I'll be right here waiting on you, right, to go make that ride. Search the camp. Come on. Search your heart tonight. Search your life. Search your home. Come on. Search it out and watch what God do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] [Applause] I'll be all right. I'll be all You know that one.
