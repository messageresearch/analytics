Lord, we ask you to forgive us. Anything we've said, done, or thought hasn't been pleasing in your sight. Father, we are down to treacherous time, evil times, and trouble times, Father. But Lord God, in the midst of all these troubles and all these things that are going on in the land, even the hurricanes or the out in the ocean, God, and look like it's heading this way, but God in wrath, remember mercy. And God, I pray God that you'll look upon the needs of your people, Father. I pray that you'll meet every need tonight, Lord. Look upon those on this prayer list, Lord. And may you help each and every individual, Lord. May you touch bodies, touch hearts, touch lives. Oh God, may you restore the backslider, and may you meet every need. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. [Music] James 4 and 6. James 4 and 6. But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he said, God resists the proud and giveth grace to the humble. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he would flee from you. Draw nigh to God and he would draw nigh to you. Clean your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded. Be afflicted and moan and weep. Let your laughter be turned into morning and your joy into heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of God, and he shall what? &gt;&gt; He will lift you up. God bless the reader's word. You may be seated. It's very important that we humble ourselves. That was a requirement. That's what God uh first Peter uh 5 and five and I'll read the fourth verse while you're turning. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Oh, you're looking forward to it, brother, sister. sheep shepherd shall appear. Wherefore likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder. And yay all of you be subject one to another and clothed with what? &gt;&gt; Humility. &gt;&gt; Humility. For God what? &gt;&gt; Resists the proud. &gt;&gt; He resists the proud but giveth what? &gt;&gt; Praise to the humble. Then he says here in the sixth verse, humble who &gt;&gt; yourself &gt;&gt; therefore under the what? &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; that he may what? &gt;&gt; Exalt you. &gt;&gt; Cast all your cares where? &gt;&gt; Upon him. &gt;&gt; For he what? &gt;&gt; Cares for you. &gt;&gt; He says be soful, be viligent because your what? as a roaring lion is not one but he as one walketh about seeking whom he may what &gt;&gt; whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but God but the God of all grace who has called us unto his eternal glory. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus. The after that ye have what? &gt;&gt; It's very difficult to understand that God has a way of strengthening us. God's blessing sometimes is in our suffering. He says, "But after you've suffered a while, make you what?" &gt;&gt; Perfect. The captain of our salvation made perfect through what? &gt;&gt; Suffering. After you suffered a while, sometimes people run because they don't want to go through nothing. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. That's right. &gt;&gt; But we consider the adversary the devil. The devil will be around to come against you and cause things to happen cause you might look at one another and and might be thinking that your problem is in one another. But the problem is that the devil will Amen. get inside of anybody at any time. If you have a door open, a gate open in your spirit. &gt;&gt; But you must be not ignorant of Satan devices. You must be wise enough to understand that the devil is just Amen. God is allowing the devil to do certain things, to say certain things. Amen. Just Amen. for you to be an overcomer and be victorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that all things will work together to the good &gt;&gt; to them that love the Lord. &gt;&gt; And because you love him, Amen. that there's no temptation taking you. But such is common to man. &gt;&gt; But God will with the temptation make a way of escape. &gt;&gt; So you must understand that, Amen. that God wants you to humble yourself. Amen. that he might exalt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's difficult for to be exalted. Amen. Because God resistes the proud, but he gives grace to the humble. &gt;&gt; The prophet God was talking about real power. Amen. Is not so much as the gifts and the healings and miracles and stuff, but a real power is to be able to humble yourself. Be able to humble yourself. That's real power. If you want to see real power, humble yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the mighty hand of God and let God exalt you. That's real power. Being humble. &gt;&gt; It says God make you perfect. After he makes you perfect, he establish you. Some people are unstable. But if you humble yourself, God will and allow yourself to suffer something, to go through some things. And we don't know how to take when when when God taking us uh through certain trials and tribulation, we don't know how to take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God wants us to humble ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He make you perfect. He establish you. Then after he established you, he'll what? &gt;&gt; He'll strengthen you. And after he strengthen you, he'll what? &gt;&gt; Settle you. See, God got a way of doing things if we allow God to do. Amen. After you suffered a while. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then this is where God is bringing you into the stature of a perfect man where God is working on you, bringing you into maturity after you suffered a while. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then God makes you perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. And then he says, "To him be glory and dominion forever and ever." Okay. So by the grace of God uh let go back to the sixth verse. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may what? &gt;&gt; Exalt &gt;&gt; exalt you and &gt;&gt; it's coming. As long as you stay humble, he he come. &gt;&gt; Hum yourselves is simply sometimes just waiting on God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Waiting on him and uh a a and knowing that God hadn't forgotten about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very real to see uh somebody going through a trial and how they cannot be patient enough to wait and see the Lord deliverance. But instead of waiting, they get impatient. But God is doing something in your trial, in your test. He resistes the proud, but give grace to the humble. If you can just say, Lord, oh, you know, God just working on you, beating. I mean, in other words, he he he's beating all the all the pride out you, all the self-confidence, all your ability, all your Oh, you just want to take matters in your own hand. Oh, can you see Jesus? Oh, I got power to call 12 legion of angels. I I y'all don't have to take this. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he knew that, Amen. that he's the captain of our salvation. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew I'm going through this. Amen. That others might Amen. might be have the ability and have the strength to be able to overcome the trials and testes of life. &gt;&gt; So I I I'm taking it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He beared our sins and our sicknesses in his own body. He went through for us. Okay. Let's go to Romans uh I mean excuse me Philippians 2 Philippians 2 and five it says let this mind be in you let this mind be in you. See sometimes we got to see whether or not I we have the mind of Christ or not. He says, you know, be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is that good and acceptable and what? &gt;&gt; Perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the mind of Christ, Amen. He said in the world you going to have you going to go through some stuff. It's it's impossible that offense will not come. So you gonna go through some stuff. It's how you handle it. &gt;&gt; Whether you take things in your own hand or whether you allow God to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I fix it? Can I I I'mma do something about it. I'll show you who I am. We don't want to see you. &gt;&gt; We want to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus, what? How do I handle this situation, God? If I don't know what I'm doing, then let me get out the way and let you do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; See, because often times I didn't know I I I come up with solutions and I try to handle situations sometime, but sometimes humbling yourself and realizing that you don't know what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A and if you Amen. just do something because you know often times you know it's all in protection and protecting our image. Amen. Making us feel I'm a man, I'm a this and you know how we getting macho. Amen. Ain't nobody going to do me like this. You know what I'm saying? Sometimes Amen. parents have to prove to the children I'm daddy here. Mama, you going you you going to respect me. Sometimes, you know, when they get up to an age of teenager, they going to show out. They going they going to do some stuff and say some stuff that you like to. But you got to pray. You got to pray hard, don't you? Yes. Lord have mercy. And don't just don't just be fussing. Get some wisdom. God, I it's some fasting and praying going to take me because I can't beat it out of them cuz it ain't coming out that way. So, I'm going to have to pray. I'm going have to seek God. I'm going to say, "Lord, they in your hand. Give me wisdom to deal with these situations." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Often times we need wisdom and we have to pray for wisdom. Sometime God gives us wisdom when we can handle God ain't going to release us the wisdom until we actually take our suffering &gt;&gt; until we go through some things. Then God releases to us. Amen. His perfection and he shows us how to handle situation because you're in the way. Amen. You're in the way. God can't do nothing until you get out the way. Amen. As long as you in the way. Amen. God cannot bless you because you in the way of the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us die to ourselves. Let us resist the devil and he will flee from us. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes, Amen. Amen. We're not resisting the devil. Amen. We actually being like the devil. But we got to resist the devil and he'll flee for from us. We say what we know we shouldn't have said and do what we know we shouldn't have done. Amen. And what happened? Then you real now who we didn't resist the devil. Amen. The resisted devil. Humble yourself. Resist the devil here. What? &gt;&gt; Flee. &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil ain't going nowhere when you in the way. Amen. Because you you you you're no match for the devil. Amen. But God bringing us to the statue of a perfect man. So we got to have temperance. We got to have patience, right? Because that's what God is bringing us into. Amen. But we we lack temperance. We lack patience because in all of that experience working patient and oh goodness we going to have to experience certain things. We have to go through certain things. But we don't wait. We just got to I got to be patient. I got to be patient. Talking it ain't going to get no. You just got to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And how do you do it? Resist the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How you resist the devil? The devil trying to get keep you from being patient. &gt;&gt; The devil trying to keep you from being tempered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your temper, you start shaking and you're trying to hold back, but you got to resist the devil that you don't have to shake no more because Amen. God doesn't give you victory, overcoming power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what? Why? Amen. You're humbling yourself. Said that's all the devil want to do. Get me upset and get my pressure up and do this and that and get me all worked up and say something that I shouldn't have said. Do something. Well, you didn't resist the devil. You let the devil have his way. But let us not do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Jesus, you know, he was tempted to all just like we were. Five, he said, "Let this mind be also in you that was in Christ, which is in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be what? &gt;&gt; But made of himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a what? &gt;&gt; Servant." &gt;&gt; Servant. and was made in the likeness of men. Mhm. Sometimes God God want us to be bold. He wants us to use the rod of correction and in that but God wants you to use it with wisdom. Don't use it and that that you use it like the flesh would use it. God gives you more wisdom, give you more grace. He gives us more grace. And if God gives you grace, you got to be able to uh uh you give grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God gives you more grace, you give grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he says, "He thought it not robbery to be equal with God and made of himself no reputation." Right? And being found in the likeness of men, I mean, and was made in the likeness of men. Amen. And being found in the fashion of a man, he what? &gt;&gt; Humbled himself. And I said, "If he humbled himself, you and I got to what?" &gt;&gt; H ourselves. &gt;&gt; Humble ourselves. We got to He said, "Well, Lord, I'm doing the best I can." And each time you overcome one thing, then there's another test up ahead. &gt;&gt; And when you overcome that test, there's another one. Why? You climbing the l Jacob's ladder. every round go. &gt;&gt; But but if you don't never climb the the first step ladder, the first step, you'll never get to the top. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you start off with patience. Amen. And then you go to virtue. But if you don't climb the ladder, you you still ain't got faith. And then you ain't got virtue. Amen. and you keep climbing. &gt;&gt; Amen. God gives you knowledge, gives you temperance, give you patience. A he comes up to brotherly kindness and then he comes up to charity. Amen. Godliness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants you to be like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But uh it it takes something. It takes a round by round. God letting different things come into your life because he knows what it's going to take to for you to come into maturity cuz God allows certain different things, certain different tests, different trials, different temptations. God allows those things to come against you and to come at you and then you Amen. how you handle that then that uh whether you passed the test or not. And then if you fail then you say why did I fail? Because I failed to be patient. I failed to be temperance. &gt;&gt; I failed to be godly. &gt;&gt; I should have handled in a godly type of way. &gt;&gt; But because I didn't humble myself, God, I didn't handle it with godliness. But I handled it as I was handling it like the flesh. I Amen. Because even my words were not with grace seasoned with salt. My words were in the flesh words. You see what I'm saying? So what happens? Godliness is he he brings you into a a very kindness. Amen. where it's gentle. Oh, you said, "Well, that's what how how do God handle uh uh sheep? How do you you know, how do how do God handle the shepherd handle the sheep? The sheep shepherd when he appears, how does the chief shepherd handle the sheep? And and sometimes we have to see how the chief shepherd handles sheep. And we got to handle Amen. situations as the sheep shepherd handles the bride. Amen. Y'all know I got trouble with saying it, chief. But I got taking my time to say it. might not sound so right, but the best I can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let him, you know, be careful that the mind that was in Christ, let it be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You said, "What? Well, how do I know uh I'm humbling myself that, you know, whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord." And what is that saying? How would h how would Jesus handle this situation? Do you think Jesus will handle it like I'm handling it? If he's not handling it like I'm handling it, then God, I I want to humble myself and I want to handle this situation like you would handle it. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; It's it it's it's very needful that we pray that God would give us wisdom. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we come to maturity. Like I say, he ain't coming back for babies. We got to come to maturity, right? &gt;&gt; And then in the fashion of a man, he humbled himself and became obedient. Humb himself and became obedient to what? &gt;&gt; That's what Paul says. I'm crucified with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, I'm crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet I not I but Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes dying out. Amen. We got to die to ourselves. And and if we die to ourselves, then Christ can be magnified in our bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want Christ to be magnified and to be glorified. We want to see the power of the love of God and the wisdom of God. And Amen. We want God to establish us. He want us to We want him to make us perfect, establish, strengthen us, and settled us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I'm Praise God. I God has done this work in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want him to do a a complete work. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want him to finish what he started. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he when he wanted a bride, he wanted a masterpiece. And when he wanted a masterpiece, he he had to keep chipping at it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is chipping. Amen. To make a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Praise God. When he can say speak, &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you have the spoken word now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The masterpiece is coming to the fullness. Amen. So by the grace of God even the death of the cross. Amen. Wherefore wherefore in the ninth verse wherefore God also has what? You know that's a you know the people that have overcome and gone through something and the bride talk about taking off in the rapture. Those folk was taken off in the rapture. But I wonder what those folks to uh walk in humility and humbleness and all of them looking for the rapture on the 23rd or the 24th. The day is the what? &gt;&gt; 25th. &gt;&gt; 26. Oh, okay. Well, they was they supposed to have been gone by now. But by the grace of God, there nothing wrong because a lot of people get caught up under the thrill. And hopefully by the grace of God, this helps us to because one day it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; One day it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I don't think it's going to be broadcast on the internet and all of that. I believe it's going to be like a thief in the night. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God going to come and uh and I'm going to tell you something. Before Christ came the first time, there's a lot of forerunners. It's been a lot of forerunners of the rapture. But one day, the rapture is going to take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it ain't everybody in the church that cuz I, you know, I'm in bride tabernacle. I'm in the message that I I'm going. Uh everybody looking to go, but uh are we ready? Are we really are we really being molded? Are we really letting the potter have control of the clay? Amen.
