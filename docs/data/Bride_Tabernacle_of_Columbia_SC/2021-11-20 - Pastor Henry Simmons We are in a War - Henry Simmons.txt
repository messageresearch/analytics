brother's sister showers and you know brother showers grandchildren and the daughters you know got murdered the other day and just wanna pray for his daughter that god would really touch her and she's really going through it's probably pretty difficult in the family i just pray god help them through their same man father in jesus name we thank you this night lord and lord god that you afforded this opportunity to come in in your house lord i ask you god to look upon your word tonight the lord as we think about our our sister's brother showers and the family lord and the daughter lord that's lost two of her children lord so father god asks you o god the confidence strengthen the lord and have mercy lord father i pray that you bless the service tonight bless your word lord help us o god in jesus christ's name we pray amen the book of romans 7 chapter romans 7 and 1 romans 7 and 1. it says know you're not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over man so long as long as he liveth for the woman which has husband is bound by the law to the hearts man so long as he live it but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if why her husband liveth and she and be she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if a husband be dead she is free from the law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit under god may god bless you reader's word you may be seated down a little farther we want to talk about we're in a war or we're in a battle amen sometimes we we talk about a war and we talk about a battle you can be in a lot of battles in in the war you can lose battles but you can win the war so we're in a war we're battling in in a battle amen so he's got plenty battles but one day it'll be the final battle the battle of armageddon that'll be the last battle amen and then the world are coming to his final battle and you and i amen we have plenty of battles through our lives plenty of battles but one day it will come to the final battle praise god where this life here will come to its completion but by the grace of god the world itself will have his final battle amen and we'll see that that battle of armageddon but by the grace of god we know that god has already pronounced victory in the last battle amen just like he said the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death so your last the last enemy amen when death and hell is stowed into the lake of fire and it's no more death no more dying no more crying and he meant it all to be over with then amen i was just sharing some of these things in mullins last night and i don't know how you know it'll come out to tonight because i had brother dwayne reading from me praise god maybe caleb will pick up a mic help me out um seven and fifteen it says for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that i do if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my what in my flesh dwelleth what no good thing you know when we talk about we are no good we got the meaning we got to have a revelation i was saying you know probably god talk about the greatest battle ever fought fought within our minds right so we all have mind battles but i was talking about how can you defeat an enemy that you don't see how can you how can you beat the enemy when you don't sin and that's what a lot of times people are losing the battle because they don't see the enemy amen but you got to be able to see your enemy amen and when you're able to see your enemy you can defeat your enemy if you can see it but a lot of times folks see other they're actually seeing what they think with their eyes and their visible amen because and when when they can see it they think that that's my enemy you know people don't really see their you know their enemy they think hey hey i i see what you're doing i heard what you're doing see what i'm saying but i'm talking about really seeing your enemy see most times people miss their enemy and and they think they're so spiritual so holy and so uh godly and all but most most people amen they can't see their enemy and that's why they do so much damage that's why you have so much friendly fire are you with me it's friendly fire they panic and they begin to have friendly fire and they begin to kill those that's on their side so oftentimes in the battle in afghanistan and vietnam and different battles world war one were a lot of times their own [Music] soldiers killed one another and they call it now friendly fire amen and then and you see what has happened out there amen so we got a lot of friendly fire in the church friendly fire your brothers and sisters shooting one another killing one another amen friendly they call it friendly fire but somebody's dead because of friendly fire somebody's crippled because of failing fire somebody's paralyzed because of friendly fire so it's because amen people panic and amen and and they think that they meant the one that's on their side they think that's the enemy so the people amen are not able to see their enemy and because if they can't see the enemy they end up killing one another why because in their mind they they burn it they think that's my enemy and they go far okay so i'm hoping that we'll get there uh i got a little further up the road in mullins but a lot of friendly fire amen we're in a war amen and we're constantly but we got to know our enemy we got to know our enemy because but oftentimes i think that we become so spiritual and so miscritified till we so so far up there till we think we understand and all the time amen we actually don't know we ought to just come down to attack it then come down to god said god here help me because what i think i know i don't know see paul was uh dealing with he said when i decided to do good evil is present with me so i find that the law going on he said when i when i think i'm going i'm doing good then i i'm doing the wrong thing see what i'm saying so paul of an apostle and a great man of god he said man i see something working here amen i see i i see i'm in contact with something working here and that's what happens amen paul realized it meant that it's something what's going on but you know you you can't get no help if you don't think you need no help and you can't get nowhere with god thinking that you already got all you need and know all you know amen you know i i said you know people get intellectual knowing the message intellectually understanding because they're smart people you got a lot of intellectual smart people that think that they have revelation because they intellectual smart people they know how to read and write and they can understand pretty good and if they go to school they'd probably be a b or a student or whatever they'll they'll be above average amen but those people usually don't have revelation they're just smart those preachers that the super teachers and super preachers a lot of times people look at them ah because they're showing their intelligence if they were in school the people would say wow they'll be the professor there'll be doctors so and so on see what i'm saying but people are getting confused intellectual knowledge with revelation amen praise god now it is a revelation to somebody like you know me you know you know because if you're on that level and i'm not on this level even in the natural you know i i couldn't understand how some people couldn't get the you know the problems right some folks go through school and don't know the timetables you said seven seven times seven nine times nine you got it right marion mary you ain't got it that quick see you had to learn that by the time you was in second grade third grade you had that back in our day and some people just couldn't get it now you don't have to think like that we had to they said boom boom and we got it square root of the square root of that boom boom boom you got it some people what is the scrap root i don't know but then the other people could spell these big words and i'm looking at huh you know teacher give them give me a little word there there there they there i don't know which one the day or day i might put down that date and they said there i said oh i'm all confused so but with math it was clicking you see what i'm saying but if something comes there to you that you can flow in a certain area and god the prophet god said the devil has one area one spot he can get you in are you with me so we all got a a place where the devil could really but if you don't ever find out what your weakness is with that spot if you don't never find it out you think you're all right cause you ain't got that spot i'm gonna tell you something your family members a lot of times tell you where that spot is because using this it runs down through the genes and you can you can look at a family member you say oh yeah that's that spot that usually is certain traits that you have amen that are natural treats that ain't good and ain't helpful for you and then and through the spiritual genes of god is the divine nature of god and it has its characteristics are you a man and god is identified by his own characteristics are you are you look man i'm getting off on some things but we must understand because you got to know your enemy you amen a lot of us are not con we don't we're not understanding our own self we don't understand why we go through certain things and why we are battling in certain areas we don't understand if we could only uh you know settle down i was talking to a sister the other day and she was telling me about but but by the child or whatever and then i i started telling her you know i said this is so and so on and this and so and so on i says you know i learned a lot of stuff from my daughter rachel because she teach special ed and so rachel would tell me daddy you got certain things that we learned in school you already got them you know i said well i didn't learn he said she said i know you don't know it in school but you the lord bless you like that but but i learned a lot from her just talking to her you know what i'm saying so by the grace of god a lot of times you know nobody diagnoses your case so lord you know just let me i said let me tell you this about your daughter i mean i don't know her i said so and so and so and so on she said i said she needed help when she was a little small she needed help she needed this and she needed that she said ah how come nobody told us you see what i'm saying see a lot of things if you can catch before it get big amen but a lot of times we we we we we got to pray and be keen and god open sometimes god even if you saw it sometimes you can't help because sometimes people patterns of their life they have to go certain ways it has to go somewhere you can't change destiny you can't change what's ordained amen even though you see it but it's good that you know when you can see and you can try to deal with it and try to help if you can see and a lot of folk can't see because they can't help you because they can't see what you need help but the reason why most folks don't get help because they don't think they need help it don't matter how much a wife try to help a husband husband hard-headed thing he pulled to be the balls he pulled to be the head and she can try to help her uh or vice versa and in the marriage always a chaos and confusion because one one won't listen to the other instead of let one help the other because you know if anybody gonna see you it'll be your husband or your wife you know what i'm saying they'll see one another folks but if we got to hum ourselves down i have to listen to renee and she has to listen to me and sometimes i'm still going to be hard-headed you see what i'm saying but there is a communication and she's always trying to help me amen and that but i got to be open i got to pray and i got to humble myself to get help are you with me and a lot of times it sometimes we don't even listen so how we gonna get help if we don't even listen because we figure well i already heard that already if you're here then you don't do no better are you with me so by the grace of god god oh let me get off of that i don't know but by the grace of god there's a wall there's a battle going on you got to know your enemies now now you know the the worst enemy you got is you yourself isn't that right now the worst enemy but most of the time you are so worried about some outside force to you not really seeing yourself you know what we spent our time worrying about uh what other folk are doing or what other folks are going through what other folks did or what other and we always just running off our mouths and worrying about this and worrying about god talking about this and talking about that and when we invite shape ourselves we need help ourselves instead of looking at god show me myself and uh you know it it it it it gets to me sometimes because the wall let me let me get me killed well i'll stop here i got to read this before i get too far gone where i can get my scripture content it's like 18 18 read it again now for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwell is no good thing for to will is present with me okay for the will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not okay i you know you all of us as christians we want to do right but how to perform it you know how to perform it we want to do it that's why a lot a lot of times people say well so-and-so didn't say they didn't mean to do that that's why the prophet said when the man was saying all kind of stuff about the prophet he said he didn't mean to do it because the prophet look at it you know anybody look at the person said i don't know he don't mean that you know what i'm saying oh but they try to convince the prophet that yeah yeah yeah oh he said he didn't mean that i forgive him he said that was a trial named before the foundation of the world that he had to go through see what i'm saying but if you look at it instead of you looking at it as your enemy the prophet of god said you know i forgive him he didn't mean it are you a friend he didn't have a brother you said something something about me i'm gonna go tell you a piece of mama he didn't mean it it did not mean it so he didn't worry about it just let it go isn't that right sometimes the things that hurt us the most amen is because we're selfish we're always thinking about our world our feelings you know self so your worst enemy is yourself jesus took something for you and i he went through some agony some pain he went through things see if he went through things for you and i we got to go through things for oh you want me but we're not willing to reverse the thing amen praise god it's all right jesus carry his cross but what about mine are you but we don't want no crowds the suffering goes with raining amen if we want to rain we going to suffer and and the suffering of our present time is not compared to be the glory that shall be revealed where in us god is doing something in us in me that is in my flesh now not nothing not in not in the spirit not in the holy ghost but in my flesh dwell is what that's two men amen the white dog in the black goal amen which one winning the one we what one we feed the most amen that's the the there's there's the call on nature amen and there's a spiritual there's a natural man and there's a spiritual man there's a first adam and there's the last adam isn't that right now long as you married to the first adam amen so in adam all what died so as long as you're married to the first adam the the flesh amen praise god you'll die amen for the wages of what sin is what yeah so you know you know but oh lord but the last adam amen praise god you got to amen you got to die this first adam got to die that we can be married to the last adam are you a man which is christ jesus amen okay so brother and sister are y'all with me amen we're going somewhere the greatest battle ever fought default where amen we're in a battle amen we're in a war amen and the weapon of our warfare are not what but they're mighty through god to the pulling out of what let's get some strongholds more down tonight y'all ready let's get some strongholds more now things that's been strong and powerful have built up and fortified themselves in your life but they got to come down tonight they meant the holy ghost to bring them down they meant your faith to bring it down they meant to got to come down tonight praise god i'm not in bondage no more praise god i refuse to be bound in bondage amen whom the son is set free is free indeed hallelujah praise god hallelujah things that has had us in bondage bondage she meant by the first adam of varnish by sin amen sin should not have dominion over you amen [Music] go ahead on brother caleb for the good that i would i do not for the good that i would i do not see it it's something paul was looking at things and he said the good that i would i do not that's a lot of things you know when you think about what am i doing what am i doing what kind of good uh the good that i would i do not see a lot of times we we're really not doing nothing we just sat around and i i tell you and the things that we do that we think that we're doing good because it's outside show it's whether or not who's going to pat us on the back who's going where we're going to get you know some glory or some great you know we always want somebody to say this say that and i appreciate this but those things that you know may not never be known amen brother joe a lot of things you do nobody might not never recognize nothing i never said thank you brother gerald roger thank you for all that you doing in briar tabernacle see man i never know i i mean i never said that you said well brother simmer you you never told me thank you i forgot but it don't mean i'm not thankful for you are you with me i appreciate you amen but if i go around and say i got to remember thank the lord for uh sister chapel because she's there you know if i got to call everybody's name i'm gonna miss somebody and then they're gonna say well he called brother jerry calls his chopping what about me i'm ending all right look at you know look at him i may call angelica and then i forget about calling grace lord have mercy happen to jesus you know you miss one name or one family or what and lord it's all chaotic isn't that right so a lot of times y'all i i'm not built that way some preachers are built that way they can just compliment compliment i ain't built that way i if i tried i'm gonna make a mess of it and i have everybody upset let's just let me go and preach my brother nathan he he he's pretty good at that but me boy y'all might think i don't even appreciate y'all are you with me but i do i appreciate y'all and i thank you for everything you do are you with me so but but let me go on now cause y'all gonna mess me up trying to you know apologize for all my weakness y'all just pray for me know that i i might mean it but i you know that's my weakness okay god bless you go ahead home but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me so so who who doing it saying that dwelleth in me it's not hard to do it you know as a christian that's why uh the prophet said he didn't mean to do that but it was sin that dwelleth in me and what we all doing we got to die what daily amen and it's a continuation i crucify i modify the members upon the earth it's always a dying out we're always in a constant battle battling with this flesh there's a a constant wall going on we're always trying to improve we're pressing towards the mark of the prize as brother ernie said of the high calling of god that's in christ amen we got to forget those things which are behind and press forward are you up man brother and sister that's what we we we're on a journey we're going somewhere the devil don't like where we're going i'm on the way to heaven and i'm enjoying the trip that sister had it saying hallelujah oh that's brother kenneth jackson uh uh grandma i'm on my way to heaven enjoying the trip amen and i'm on my way to heaven enjoying the trip amen and you got to you got to fight for every instagram amen every inch of ground that you get you got to fight for amen that's why he give you the holy ghost that's why he gives you the end time joshua the baptism of the holy ghost to take you and that you defeated every devil amen praise god god give you what it takes to defeat the devil so you got to go out and oh lord he gave you it gave you the land it's yours praise god god give you the victory amen sin that dwelleth in me go ahead on i find in a law that when i would do good evil is present with me go ahead but i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members you know affection memory conscience all of that that that stuff will mess you up but down in your soul you got to have what faith you got to believe you got to believe you got to have faith you got to be anchored down in the soul the holy ghost baptism on your flesh in the spirit but down in the soul that's where the gene seed is praise god how you man that's where the life is amen that's where you got an ankle amen ankle in the soul amen my soul has been anchored praise god that's where amen faith takes amen and it dominates amen and it begins to work and bring all of these in subjection they meant it brings the spirit it brings the flesh into objection they meant praise god because faith is there faith in what faith in the word of god amen praise god i'm holding to the word hallelujah the devil amen he can't do nothing with you praise god when you know who you are amen but what happens you so many times folks are blind amen go ahead and read i got to get rid of the wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin okay so so by the grace of god it's something about the the prophet of god says you're you're trying to tell god what to do you know a lot of folks are trying to tell god what to do they try to tell god god this is what i want you to do and you know you you'll try to tell god what to do okay sometimes people try to tell a pastor what to do sometimes people try to you know tell their parents what to do we sometimes i i tell the children thank you daddy you know you know you have to tell them thank you you got to because they telling you how to do it what to do isn't that right tell them thank you and they know what you mean thank you you know children will try to tell you what to do and it might be fine but it's just sometimes they find out they ain't just telling you what to do they're almost telling they're not asking you what to do they're telling you what to do are you with me so yeah holy man and holy minute you got the shoe on the wrong foot are you with me y'all understand what i'm talking about you got to shoot on the wrong foot some of y'all young people okay and that's old-timey talking ain't that brother fred they don't know what to shoot on the wrong foot i got to break that down y'all got it young people okay so here we are we we we we we we're in a place where we need to understand amen that you can't you you're not telling god what to do like you guard boss that's what the church has done it's a woman trying to be over the man it's the church trying to be over god are you with me and that's what jezebel was over ahab he was the king she was supposed to be the queen but she was telling ahab what to do but you won't have that not with god god said he'd give us space to repent of her fornication she repented not isn't that right so what happens amen we can't tell god how to run his church are you with me that things got to be done decently and in order okay so he says telling god what to do and how to do it you're trying to tell god what to do prayer should be lord changed me to fit your word are y'all with me lord change me to fit your word not change your word to fit what i want to do but change me to fit your word not change let let me change your mind changing god's mind you change my mind you know ask god lord you change my mind don't try to change god mind you ask god to change what change your mind a lot of oh lord see you change my mind to your will change my mind to your will you're what god's servant said change my mind to your will is not right do you want god to do that to change your mind that it would be god's will is anything wrong with that okay and your will is written here in the book god's will is written right here in the bible oh you look man it's a word lord don't let me go till you got my mind set just like your mind are you with me we need to be praying and crying out to god until we get the mind of god not i got the mind of god you know you ain't got it you ain't humble enough to have it when you got the mind of god amen you're going to suffer some things you're going to be willing to suffer something when you've got the mind of god you're going to go through some things the capital of our salvation was made perfect through what suffering folks i ain't got to take it yes you do you're gonna have to take more than this and that you're gonna take a whole lot if you're gonna make it are you with me and then when my mind is set like your mind then i'll believe every word you wrote i believe every word you wrote amen and you say in there you make everything work together for good to them that what that love you are you with me god a word i mean if you love god god will make everything work together till you're good see god ain't gonna put no put you in a situation and put you out there amen and god ain't gonna take care of you amen you might have to go through you might have to go to the lion then but god gonna be there you might have to go in the fire but god will be there praise god you might have to amen go through some stuff in life but god will never leave you he'll never forsake you god will be there for you it's going to work to your good i don't care how look joseph had to go to part of his house he had to go in into the prison he had to go through certain things but god worked it out job had some troubles in life he went through a lot of things but god worked it out amen god will work it out for you but you got to know your enemy now the reason why folk trying to fight the devil and can't see him because the bible said and
