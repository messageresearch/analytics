[38:07] 18 and one it says and after these
[38:12] things I saw another Angel come down
[38:15] from heaven having great power and the
[38:18] Earth was lightened with his
[38:21] glory and he cried mightily with a
[38:24] strong
[38:25] voice s Babylon the great is
[38:28] Fallen it's fallen and has become the
[38:31] habitation of
[38:33] devils and the
[38:35] whole of every foul spirit in the
[38:39] cage of every unclean and hateful
[38:43] birds for all nations have drunk of the
[38:47] wine of the rra of her
[38:49] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[38:52] have committed fornication with her and
[38:55] the merchant of the earth of watches
[38:58] Rich through the abundancy of her
[39:02] delicacy and I
[39:04] heard another voice from
[39:07] Heaven s come out of
[39:11] her my
[39:13] people that ye be not that ye be not
[39:18] partakers of her
[39:20] sins and that you receive not of her
[39:24] plagues God bless you read word you may
[39:26] be
[39:30] seated subject this morning is come out
[39:32] of
[39:34] her come out of
[39:37] her we're familiar with mysty of babon
[39:40] in Revelation 17 and we know that she's
[39:43] the mother of hara Revelation 17 and5
[39:46] and he said upon her forehead was a name
[39:49] written mystery she's a mystery but to
[39:52] us she's no longer a
[39:54] mystery amen
[39:57] for God has opened up and revealed to us
[40:00] who she is she's not a mystery Babylon
[40:03] is not a mystery to
[40:06] us we know that Rome sets on Seven
[40:09] Mountains Seven
[40:11] Hills and we know that
[40:14] inhered the mother of Hollows which is
[40:18] Catholicism are you with me amen and we
[40:21] know that the Protestant church was
[40:23] birthed out of the Roman Catholic Church
[40:26] becomes the
[40:28] daughters so the first organized
[40:31] religion is Roman
[40:34] Catholicism and everybody that followed
[40:37] that system became the daughters of the
[40:41] mother and the Bible teaches us that
[40:44] denominationalism and organized
[40:48] religion is Mystery babon the
[40:52] great folks are just not going to church
[40:55] and thinking that they're worshiping God
[40:57] the Bible says he'll be the temple of
[40:59] God showing themselves that he is God
[41:01] and that they actually
[41:04] worshiping the devil in the
[41:07] church and they don't even know
[41:09] it are you with me the Bible said if it
[41:13] was possible he would deceive even the
[41:15] very
[41:16] elect are you with me but God shorten
[41:20] the days that the elect could be
[41:22] saved are you with me so let's look look
[41:26] at it brothers sisters amen there's it's
[41:29] it's a mystery to those that cannot see
[41:32] but to us God has made amen he's
[41:36] revealed to us who she
[41:38] is so we're not ignorant of Satan
[41:42] devises are you with
[41:44] me so brother and sister God calls us
[41:47] out we have come out with all types of
[41:49] denominational
[41:51] systems amen we come out amen it doesn't
[41:55] a lot of people say well we we're not
[41:56] we're not a denomination we're not a
[41:59] organized religion but we see the
[42:01] hierarchy
[42:04] system how you have the Pope the
[42:07] Cardinal the archbishops and all the
[42:10] down a lot of churches got the apostles
[42:14] bard of Bishop this that got their
[42:16] hierarchy system pyramid
[42:19] system what it is to conquer the Ley
[42:23] liula and
[42:25] spirit
[42:26] are you with
[42:28] me but you look at the church in the
[42:31] Bible we saw no s
[42:33] system what happened was the Catholic

[45:24] preacher in any man but you can't find
[45:27] no fault in Jesus am are you with
[45:32] me praise God so you're responsible of
[45:36] keeping the
[45:37] word people can exalt me they can exalt
[45:40] the prophet but we don't want to exalt
[45:43] nobody but
[45:45] Jesus are you up man exalt Jesus Christ
[45:50] that's who we exal am we thank God for
[45:54] the preachers we thank God for the for

[46:03] amen but it's Jesus
[46:05] Christ amen he's the head of the
[46:08] church amen and he is the word amen yes
[46:13] so the opening of the word amen is for
[46:16] you and I in this hour that we live
[46:19] in amen we got to respect to God's
[46:24] word not the word

[47:54] taking away from somebody well you
[47:56] taking away from the pastor you're
[47:57] taking away from the prophet no no no no
[47:59] no it need to be
[48:02] said because sometime you go to church
[48:04] and you think the people worshiping man
[48:06] instead of the worshiping
[48:08] God are you up me amen but they said no
[48:12] no no you got to have a revelation I got
[48:13] to have a revelation to worship the
[48:17] man are you with
[48:19] me you don't understand oh no no no no
[48:23] you worship God the angel that showed us
[48:27] these things he saids see th doeth not
[48:29] I'm on your fellow servants the prophets
[48:31] worship God don't bow down to
[48:35] me
[48:38] Amen Let let's let's go ahead uh did I
[48:42] read um Revelation 175 and upon her
[48:45] forehead was a name written mystery of
[48:47] Babylon the great uh the mother hollers
[48:50] and Abomination of the Earth Mother when
[48:52] you're a mother that means you got every
[48:54] woman ain't a mother
[48:56] cuz every woman ain't got no
[48:59] children right well we know Jezebel had
[49:02] a daughter named
[49:04] aaliah isn't that
[49:06] right Jezebel was in Israel with Ahab
[49:09] and aaliah was in
[49:11] Judah are you with me her
[49:14] daughter as that was Shadow and types
[49:16] and shadows amen then it comes the
[49:19] reality form in our day isn't that right
[49:23] so we see what we have come in contact
[49:25] with we it's an adultery system that
[49:28] we're dealing with and it's been exposed
[49:31] by the opening of the
[49:33] word are you with me well we go to
[49:36] church clap our hand long as we shout
[49:38] and dancing we don't need to know
[49:40] nothing all we need to do is come to
[49:42] church shout and dance Hallelujah
[49:44] everybody going to heaven no no no no
[49:47] the Bible say you should know the
[49:49] truth if Jesus would not come the
[49:52] Pharisees would go on and say we right
[49:54] the Sadducees say you right but one day
[49:58] amen the voice of one cry in the
[49:59] wilderness came out and he said
[50:03] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[50:05] hand that was John the Baptist he was he
[50:08] had the spirit of Elijah come telling
[50:10] the people to repent are you with me did
[50:13] the people repent
[50:16] no amen no and when John pointed out
[50:20] Jesus the lamb to take away the sins of
[50:23] the world they killed him
[50:26] but it was all it it was all right
[50:29] because that's what they were supposed
[50:30] to do they were supposed to reject him
[50:32] and kill them ain't that right cuz the
[50:35] word said he was wounded for our
[50:36] transgression he was bruised for our
[50:38] iniquities and the chastising of our
[50:40] peace was upon him with the stripes we
[50:42] were healed if we if he didn't die we
[50:45] wouldn't be
[50:46] healed if he didn't die our sin wouldn't
[50:49] be forgiven but because he died our sins
[50:53] could be
[50:54] forgiven because he he died amen we
[50:56] could be
[50:58] healed thank you Jesus oh I'm excited
[51:02] about God being so good to me amen I
[51:05] told him in Sunday school it's good to
[51:07] know amen how much he loves you how much
[51:10] he cares for us to open our eyes we
[51:13] could have been blind like the rest of
[51:15] the world but God let us see amen that
[51:19] is not just going to church it's the
[51:22] word amen yes Lord Jes it's not just
[51:26] shouting and dancing but it's the
[51:32] word we don't want to get into Pacific
[51:35] but by the grace of God let's go to uh 2
[51:39] Corinthians 6 come out of her amen my
[51:43] people God called his people the church
