[33:56] there's no sub sub
[33:58] itute are you with
[34:01] me and there's no substitute for
[34:06] you praise God because you were in the
[34:09] mind of God before the foundation of the
[34:13] world
[34:15] Amen the prophet I was reading the
[34:17] prophet
[34:18] says he was talking about um the seed of
[34:21] the serpent he was talking about Cain
[34:24] and he said that uh people were having
[34:27] trouble
[34:29] with Genesis said I gotten a man from
[34:31] the
[34:32] Lord and He was saying
[34:35] that there
[34:37] was you know Eve didn't get
[34:41] a a man from the Lord cuz God was not
[34:46] kain's
[34:47] father are you with me the Lord
[34:51] wasn't but all
[34:54] life that comes in The World God Only
[34:57] life could come through God are y'all
[35:00] with
[35:01] me but he was saying
[35:04] that when it comes down
[35:08] to the life that's
[35:12] in Adam and in Eve because they were a
[35:15] son and daughters of
[35:17] God then he says where did Cain get his
[35:20] nature
[35:23] from Cain had to get his nature from
[35:26] somewhere else
[35:28] because
[35:30] Eve and
[35:32] Adam was the son and daughter of
[35:36] God but the Bible says Cain was of that
[35:39] Wicked one he killed he murdered are you
[35:43] with me he
[35:45] lied are you with
[35:47] me so we thank God
[35:50] that and he said what about
[35:53] Judas he said Judas was born the son of
[36:00] prediction even before he got in the
[36:02] world he was born that way to do what he
[36:06] did he was ordained before the
[36:09] foundation he was going to do it when he
[36:11] was born he was born the son of
[36:14] predition so brothers and sister I said
[36:17] all of that to say this you were
[36:21] born when you're born again the Holy
[36:24] Ghost is a witness the holy ghost
[36:27] witness that you are Sons and Daughters
[36:30] of
[36:31] God only through the baptism of the Holy
[36:34] Ghost do you have that witness that you
[36:36] are a son or daughter of
[36:40] God the Holy Ghost let you know and give
[36:43] you that Assurance without the baptism
[36:45] of the Holy Ghost you have doubt you
[36:47] have fear you can think and you
[36:50] can believe it all you want but the Holy
[36:53] Ghost is a
[36:55] witness and except we receive re the
[36:57] baptism of the Holy
[36:59] Ghost will never be Sons and Daughters
[37:02] of
[37:03] God because the Holy Ghost is a witness
[37:07] that you are Sons and Daughters of God
[37:10] are you with me so the Holy Ghost is
[37:12] very important that you receive the
[37:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost how you get it
[37:17] praise God he
[37:20] said Jacob didn't care how he got it he
[37:23] wanted the
[37:24] birthright you got to want it so bad to
[37:27] God I got to have it because it's the
[37:31] birthright and I got to have the baptism
[37:34] of the Holy Ghost I got to have
[37:36] God that
[37:38] Assurance I got to have that seal I got
[37:42] to have the Holy Ghost so I ain't going
[37:44] to get in way but I already did right
[37:48] God bless you thank God for you
[37:52] so we going to sing that little song as
[37:55] we have dedication of the baby

[44:00] obtained promises stopped the mouth of
[44:03] lions quenched the violence of fire
[44:05] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[44:07] weakness were made strong wax violent
[44:10] and fight and turned to the flight the
[44:13] armies of aliens women received their

[44:21] that they may obtain a better
[44:23] Resurrection may God bless bless the
[44:25] reading of his word tonight
[44:28] by the grace of God I just I just want
[44:30] to minister just for a moment on out of
[44:34] weakness Amen on out of weakness you
[44:37] know I like how the Bible here you know
[44:40] talks about you know he says time would
[44:43] failed you know to tell everybody
[44:45] testimony right because you know it's
[44:48] something that what God you know I was
[44:51] looking at something the prophet of God
[44:52] was talking saying that you know of what
[44:55] God's kingdom is going to be made up of
[44:58] people that been through something of
[45:00] the outcast the rejected the ones that
[45:03] suffered a while but God makes his
[45:06] kingdom up of those of those kind of
[45:08] people but we find that I says you know
[45:10] out of weakness you know out of weakness
[45:13] made strong you know I was thinking I
[45:15] said it's hard it's hard for a man or
[45:19] it's hard for God to be the strength of
[45:20] a man when he think when he thinks he's
[45:23] at his height it's hard for God to be
[45:26] the strength of a man when he thinks
[45:28] he's at his height you know I was
[45:30] thinking of something the other night
[45:32] the other morning rather and I said you
[45:34] know sometimes people they they they say
[45:38] they can't they can't pray or they on
[45:40] the fire the time to pray right but
[45:42] God's got a way of driving you to your
[45:46] knees he's got a way of doing that don't
[45:48] he and he knows what it takes to get
[45:51] each and every one of us down on our
[45:52] knees again thought it was something uh
[45:55] you know brother Fred was talking the
[45:58] other night was on the way to sh and he
[45:59] was saying about how you know the about
[46:02] the Halo and the pillar of fire you know
[46:05] being in the churches and how God he was
[46:08] hearing of how you know God was moving
[46:11] at a time and he was saying I wonder
[46:13] what happened cuz God didn't change and
[46:16] then brother Brooks was saying the same
[46:18] thing the other night I thought that was
[46:19] something that cuz God never changed
[46:22] right but God's got a way of getting us
[46:24] where we need to be at and I thank God
[46:27] for that but I says you know it's hard
[46:29] for God to get a man you know uh uh to
[46:32] that place when he's when he's thinks
[46:34] he's already in a certain spot right I
[46:38] thought about Nebuchadnezzar and all and
[46:40] I say you know you know even after God
[46:43] warned him in a dream to pretty much you
[46:46] know watch yourself right don't think
[46:49] you too higher than what you are but
[46:51] even after being warned in the dream he
[46:54] his flesh he couldn't help but to be
[46:56] lifted up up in it right but in that
[47:00] time God you know as he begin to say all
[47:02] the things he done and the Bible said a
[47:04] voice fell from heaven didn't it but and
[47:08] caused them you know to go out into the
[47:10] field we know the story but at the end
[47:13] of all of that you know I like how the
[47:15] Bible says you know he lifted up his
[47:18] voice and he blessed the Lord Praise You
[47:22] Know came out of all of that he he
[47:24] learned how to praise he learned learned
[47:27] how to give God let's say Glory out of
[47:29] all of that didn't he after all of that
[47:32] but what it was that wasn't just uh uh
[47:35] done just to be done but you know God
[47:37] was showing us something there and a lot
[47:39] of times we look at it as you can't you
[47:42] can't force a
[47:44] humility a humility you can't it's
[47:46] something that you can't make up but
[47:49] it's something that God does for you in
[47:51] your life it's a place that where you
[47:53] being you and yourself wouldn't have
[47:56] went but God took took you there but
[47:58] from then you learned how to bless God
[48:02] from then you learned you always
[48:04] conscience then of of you giving God the
[48:07] glory in all things and you know I was
[48:10] thinking I says you know was looking at
[48:12] I says you know a lot of
[48:14] times you know you know people I I says
[48:18] most of the most of the strongest men I
[48:20] was thinking about Jesus in his even in
[48:22] his uh time you know of of guest enemy
[48:26] and he was was praying and how the Bible
[48:28] you know he's kept saying Lord if it be
[48:29] your will let this cup pass I mean let
[48:32] the cup pass but then he kept going back
[48:34] and praying but in agony the Bible says
[48:36] that he was praying and all these things
[48:38] but I like how the Bible says that you
[48:40] know in the Book of Luke that an angel
[48:42] came and strengthened him you know but
[48:45] even at that time I says you know God
[48:48] gets us uh uh to a place you know at at
[48:52] your at your weakness we as we say even
[48:55] at your at out of weak made strong you
[48:58] know it's situations and I thought about
[49:00] you know a lot of this because I was I
[49:03] was been doing a lot of witnessing
[49:04] lately or you know talking about Lord on
[49:07] the job but I was saying you know one of
[49:10] the guys he told me he says uh Ernest
[49:12] this a guy named Ryan he says he says
[49:14] man I think they walk my friend out
[49:16] today and and uh it's a guy he grew up
[49:20] with on the job but he says um I mean he
[49:23] grew up with him in Greenville but the
[49:25] guy had been working at the job for
[49:26] about a week and he didn't even know who
[49:29] he was and they're only I think 36 years
[49:31] old but he says I didn't I couldn't even
[49:34] recognize him said he recognized me but
[49:36] I couldn't recognize him and he says you
[49:40] know when I finally recognized him he
[49:42] said I stared there and looked at him
[49:44] for a moment he says it broke my heart
[49:46] Earnest to see him he said I said to him
[49:50] uh uh pudding that he called him by his
[49:52] nickname he said is that you he said
[49:55] yeah he says he says man man he says I
[49:58] wanted to ask him so bad he says but I
[50:00] asked him you all right say he wanted to
[50:03] ask him so bad what happened to him cuz
[50:05] he's only 36 years old he wasn't even
[50:08] recognizable but he said he asked him
[50:11] are you all right he said the guy
[50:13] response to him was life did this to
[50:16] me and I and then he he's coming to work
[50:19] I guess drunk and then so they walked
[50:21] him out but I told Ryan I says you know
[50:25] that something happened to him something
[50:27] in life broke
[50:28] him you know I said something in life
[50:32] got him to his weakest
[50:34] point and it broke him and you know what
[50:36] happens I said a lot of a lot of people
[50:38] today they they walking around like they
[50:41] normal but they ain't but they done lost
[50:44] it something broke them they walking
[50:48] around like they normal but they're not
[50:50] really themselves and what happens some
[50:54] someday something will happen and and it
[50:57] and and it'll just blow over Edge and
[50:59] you say I didn't know that was but they
[51:01] always they broke something broke them
[51:03] long time
[51:05] ago but you didn't know it we were
[51:08] saying like how somebody spilled some
[51:10] somebody got some some soda or something
[51:13] spilled on their shoes and they killed
[51:16] two people I said that ain't
[51:19] normal they walked around I said I
[51:21] didn't know they had that they lost it
[51:23] they've been you know but I says what it
[51:26] is only
[51:28] God can help us through those times you
[51:31] know at those breaking points what
[51:33] happens a lot of times it says
[51:36] individuals out of weakness made strong
[51:39] individuals at their weakest times right
[51:42] they turn to everything but
[51:45] Jesus at the times when you when they
[51:48] need him the most or or when only he can
[51:51] help them they turn everywhere else but
[51:53] him right but I says the thing
[51:57] is that's that's the time you know when
[52:00] you try to introduce people to Christ
[52:03] and let them know that it doesn't matter
[52:05] what you been through what you're going
[52:06] through at your Breaking Point God can
[52:09] do something at your Breaking Point come
[52:11] on at the point where everybody turned
[52:14] around turned turned you away nobody
[52:17] seem can help you and all those things
[52:19] it's somebody that been there before
[52:22] come on somebody's got a testimony and
[52:25] I'm one of them that can tell tell you
[52:26] that God will take up time with you come
[52:30] on at your weakest point that God will
[52:32] be your strength come on I I was saying
[52:35] to myself a little saying I was thinking
[52:38] about some you know some situations I've
[52:40] been praying praying for and I said
[52:43] you've been strong for too long come on
[52:46] now it's time to let God handle it you
[52:49] know you can you can try to handle that
[52:51] situation for so long and it break you
[52:55] but learn turn it over to Jesus come on
[52:59] God want to help you in that
[53:01] situation but many of times we find
[53:04] individuals don't do that do they we
[53:07] find that but I say it's what it is out
[53:09] of weakness God will take that that that
[53:12] weakest moment come on we call it we
[53:15] looking here at the Christian side of it
[53:18] but a lot of times even for God to get a
[53:20] person's attention he brings them to
[53:22] that place come on he brings you and and
[53:26] and to do that to let you know that he
[53:28] loves you come on he sometimes whether
[53:31] it's sickness whether it's just the
[53:33] trials of Life all these things God want
[53:35] to get Glory out of that situation come
[53:38] on you got to let God get Glory out of
[53:41] it I don't believe it was one person
[53:43] that ever cried out to God and really
[53:45] meant it from the bottom of their heart
[53:46] that he didn't come and see about them
[53:49] no matter the name no matter the family
[53:51] the church whatever when a person cried
[53:54] out for God open as I was saying the
[53:56] other other Sunday at church what it is
[53:59] you in we invite God in but he already
[54:02] know that you just want the torment to
[54:04] be gone you don't want him to be ruled
[54:06] over your life come on but God I said
[54:10] not only let God come in he going to
[54:12] deal with the torment but he wants to
[54:13] rule in your life come on what happens
[54:17] it's so hard to surrender it's so hard
[54:20] to let go come on but after the devil
[54:23] done beat you up after the devil done
[54:25] torment at your mind after the devil
[54:28] down had you cry all your tears out here
[54:30] come Jesus walking in come on they want
[54:33] to pick you up out of that place where
[54:35] you are and all the glory of God it is
[54:38] that's where he gets his glory at when
[54:40] the devil down walked all over you come
[54:43] on when the devil down beat you took
[54:47] your body through all kinds of things
[54:49] and the doctors can't find out what's
[54:50] wrong with you that's when God gets the
[54:52] glory I was talking with somebody the
[54:54] other day and they doing all doing a lot
[54:57] of talking and pouring their heart and
[54:59] soul out you know and saying and I was I
[55:02] was trying to tell them I said that's
[55:03] the thing you've been trying to handle
[55:05] it you got to let go and let God handle
[55:08] it come on I said you can't even praise
[55:11] you can't even God can't even get the
[55:13] praise out of your life as you are
[55:15] because you sitting there trying to deal
[55:16] with that situation I says but what it
[55:19] is I can't let that situation break me
[55:21] come on I can't let nothing stop my
[55:24] praise nothing stop my growth in God God
[55:26] come on whatever it is I said Lord no
[55:28] matter what I'm still going to praise
[55:30] you the end goal is to make Heaven my
[55:33] home come
[55:34] on when it's all said and done that's
[55:37] what the kingdom of go uh of God is made
[55:40] up of come on those kind of people that
[55:43] was when they was at their ends with
[55:45] they found somehow to still press their
[55:48] way through
[55:50] Hallelujah but we find that I says out
[55:52] of weakness what happens you know in in
[55:55] in the weak weaknesses come on don't
[55:57] forget to turn to
[55:59] God in the weaknesses don't forget that
[56:02] God is all powerful come on in your
[56:06] weakness don't forget that God he is the
[56:08] creator of Heaven and Earth you know I
[56:11] was thinking about some things the other
[56:13] day and just the massiveness we can't
[56:15] even uh uh comprehend come on the mass
[56:19] of of what God is but what the devil's
[56:21] job is to do is to keep you believing
[56:23] that God don't care about you and your
[56:25] situation
[56:27] come on but God not only does he cares
[56:30] he knows he already knew the thing that
[56:32] would stump you the thing that would
[56:33] come your way but what he wants you to
[56:35] do is let him come in and deal with the
[56:38] situation oh Jesus you know I was I was
[56:41] sharing with the a guy the day at work I
[56:43] know I got off work after 5:00 but I was
[56:45] sitting there talking to guy at work and
[56:47] he was saying man I didn't know you was
[56:49] from Mullins he said my wife's from
[56:50] Mullin we got to talking and you know we
[56:53] know a lot of the same people and things
[56:55] and he was just talking about you know
[56:58] um how it is in Mullins and how they
[57:00] don't have jobs down there and how you
[57:02] know you know the uh the situation is
[57:05] and how and you know the how dire the
[57:08] situation is going on and and the things
[57:10] he was just talking I says but I says
[57:13] the thing is I begin to tell them I says
[57:15] you know and how the Lord saved me at an
[57:18] early age in life I said the thing is
[57:21] out of all that we can talk about in all
[57:24] those things and and all of you know
[57:27] what transpired in my life even up to
[57:29] now the greatest thing that I could ever
[57:31] have done was to give Jesus my heart
[57:35] come on at an early age I says and you
[57:38] know what when in that moment from from
[57:41] that moment I haven't turned around I
[57:43] haven't turned to look back come on
[57:46] that's what it is you know sometimes we
[57:49] talk about the past but if you don't be
[57:51] careful the devil will have you looking
[57:53] back come on but there's nothing to look
[57:55] back to
[57:56] Hallelujah I said I can only look
[57:58] forward to what God has in store for me
[58:01] you know I was sharing with some I said
[58:03] the thing is you know I was talking
[58:05] another guy at work and he was uh he was
[58:07] breaking to us down about the uh the the
[58:10] law of physics and he was talking about
[58:12] certain things and then he got to
[58:14] talking about the Bible then he says
[58:16] that you know uh about Witchcraft and
[58:19] how he says that they they say
[58:21] witchcraft is bad that's just because
[58:23] they don't want to uh let us uh uh they
[58:26] they don't want us to tap into it
[58:27] because it'll be tapping into your inner
[58:30] power and stuff he's going on and on
[58:32] teaching us all you think he was like 26
[58:35] years old but then he started saying
[58:38] even Jesus used witchcraft he started
[58:41] talking like that and that that might
[58:43] have got my attention right there so I
[58:46] got to tell him I said no ho ho and then
[58:48] he then he began to say um he don't
[58:51] understand how people believe the Bible
[58:54] when it's got so many contradictions in
[58:56] it and I said show me one contradiction
[59:00] in the scriptures and then he says well
[59:03] okay he says for one he says the Bible
[59:04] says you shouldn't ask God for anything
[59:07] or ask him any questions I said show me
[59:10] that in the
[59:11] Bible I said uh I was
[59:15] always taught you know that you have not
[59:18] because you ask not come on I started
[59:20] quoting those scriptures and he says
[59:22] I'll show you I said well show us I said
[59:24] it that could be proven
[59:26] so then after a while then he began to
[59:28] saying you know how you your Grandmama
[59:30] use witchcraft when she he said you
[59:33] remember when you got sick and and and
[59:36] your grandma laid you on the bed and
[59:38] he's real young you Grandma laid you on
[59:40] the bed and put incense all around and
[59:42] made all kind of I said my grandma
[59:44] didn't do
[59:45] that I said when I got sick my Grandma
[59:48] and Mama laid hands on you just like the
[59:50] Bible says come on so then uh he was
[59:54] talking but he he was really you can
[59:56] tell he's really really in well
[59:58] intelligent but sometimes you know we
[1:00:01] can be so so deep right cuz we let him
[1:00:03] teach us for about half an hour but
[1:00:06] going on with that and then um after a
[1:00:10] while he followed me outside to the car
[1:00:13] and he says Ernest I want to apologize
[1:00:15] to you well he caught up with me he says
[1:00:19] I couldn't find that in the Bible where
[1:00:21] it says don't ask God for nothing these
[1:00:23] things so I says he says I don't know
[1:00:26] why he says but that's always what I've
[1:00:28] been told I says a lot of problem is
[1:00:32] people don't read the Bible for their s
[1:00:35] i says they've been told and and they a
[1:00:39] lot of people go to church don't read
[1:00:40] the Bible for their s so they don't know
[1:00:43] what's in there I said I'm going tell
[1:00:44] you something I says I says the Lord
[1:00:47] saved me at an early age I says but I
[1:00:50] don't want I I would I wouldn't be
[1:00:52] telling the truth if I told you I
[1:00:55] understood everything right I says but I
[1:00:59] can't say that I found any
[1:01:00] contradictions in it and I said I I I
[1:01:03] know one thing I know the Bible to be
[1:01:05] true I says that everything that God
[1:01:08] ever promised me came to pass I said
[1:01:10] everything that God ever I ever asked
[1:01:13] God of come on in faith believing God
[1:01:16] did exactly what he said he'll do
[1:01:18] whether it come to Healing blessings or
[1:01:20] whatever I said I said but I begin to
[1:01:22] talk to him about being saved but I felt
[1:01:25] the presence of God come because now it
[1:01:28] wasn't just it wasn't the crowd wasn't
[1:01:30] there it's just me and him talking
[1:01:34] so he was saying when I began to talk to
[1:01:37] him about being saved he says I ain't
[1:01:40] never been saved
[1:01:41] before so I was telling charlet I said
[1:01:45] you know the thing about it is I believe
[1:01:48] if I had just a little bit more time
[1:01:50] he'd have been wanting to get baptized
[1:01:52] right then but I said all that say this
[1:01:56] I said you know sometimes you know in
[1:01:58] times past we might have did a little
[1:02:00] handle it a little different but I said
[1:02:04] God the young young man I believe he's
[1:02:08] hungering for something but when you
[1:02:10] don't you can't satisfy what that hunger
[1:02:13] is a Hungry Man a Hungry Man will eat
[1:02:15] anything come on but I believe that
[1:02:19] inside of there is still a candidate
[1:02:22] come on for Christ to save inside of but
[1:02:26] I want to say sometimes stuff happen to
[1:02:28] people and that's why they are the way
[1:02:31] they are but I thank God that it don't
[1:02:34] have to be sometimes all this deep and
[1:02:36] drastic things but when his presence
[1:02:38] comes it's just a simple word comes in
[1:02:42] but it changes things in the people life
[1:02:45] to they want more Hallelujah come on and
[1:02:48] he wants to give you more if you open
[1:02:50] the door and let them in y'all believe
[1:02:52] that tonight Hallelujah but I says out
[1:02:55] of weakness come on out of weakness the
[1:02:58] the the those situations I was thinking
[1:03:00] about a couple more testimonies I had
[1:03:02] but I don't want to be long tonight
[1:03:04] situations I said look like God just
[1:03:06] been bringing people to me telling me
[1:03:09] about situations and I can see how this
[1:03:12] one is alcoholic because of this this
[1:03:15] one on drugs because of this and we look
[1:03:17] at but not knowing their story sometimes
[1:03:19] come on but what it was when in that
[1:03:22] place they went to the wrong he come on
[1:03:26] they went to the wrong channel to try to
[1:03:29] soothe the pain that they were going
[1:03:31] through they went to the wrong channel
[1:03:34] to try to to try to get peace for the uh
[1:03:37] uh the calm the storm that they were in
[1:03:40] come on but if they were to only know or
[1:03:42] if somebody would have been there able
[1:03:45] come on to lead them to the right place
[1:03:48] come on in that place I believe God
[1:03:51] could have did something and I believe
[1:03:52] God can still do something now in their
[1:03:55] lives you believe that tonight God is
[1:03:57] good y'all feel all right tonight I said
[1:04:00] God is good amen you know I said some
[1:04:03] strange things
[1:04:05] happening but I thank God for them
[1:04:08] anyhow you know Lord I believe is doing
[1:04:11] some things little by little too come on
[1:04:15] I believe little by little but what it
[1:04:17] is you got to start opening your mouth
[1:04:20] God bring people to you don't shy to be
[1:04:22] talk to them about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:25] and to tell what God has done for you
[1:04:28] because it might do something for them
[1:04:30] to help them in the situation that
[1:04:32] they're in to let them know that come on
[1:04:35] you might be at your weakness but that's
[1:04:37] the place where God used people at come
