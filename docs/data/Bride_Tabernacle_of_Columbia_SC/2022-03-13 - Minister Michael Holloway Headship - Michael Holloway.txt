be here with you again fellowship this morning amen we're going to kind of continue on a similar line of thought we started on friday night for god's grace i pray it'll be a help to each one of us present myself included amen amen i'm invite you if you have your bibles determine the book of colossians chapter 1 verse 12. colossians chapter 1 verse 12. the other night i was just kind of laying a little bit of a foundation thought to recognize that god has been so gracious to us in this age to bring us back to the the true word of god there's a lot of presumptions about what this bible means and what this book means and why god wrote it the way he wrote it but in this last day we've been told that god has opened up the seven seals to make known us the hidden mysteries of this book and now we see it a little bit differently we see it differently than we were taught by parents we see it differently than we thought for our own selves at one point in time and now we got a vindicated message to let us know exactly what this book is all about so so friday night we were just dealing with the fact that we've been brought back and restored back to that word and so we can look at things not based upon what we see them to be but what god had for ordained and told us they would be and as we're watching these events unfold we see exactly the word of god coming to pass in front of our eyes and so this morning i want to deal with a little bit different aspect of the night i was dealing more in terms of us seeing the world condition now i want to deal with it and seeing our condition let's look at colossians chapter 1 verse 12 before we do let's bow our heads for a word of prayer dear heavenly father lord we want to thank you for your grace this morning thank you for your favor lord thank you and we ask once again your forgiveness of sins lord as we yield ourselves to you this morning lord we just want to step aside i just want to use i yield i give to you lord you created it you placed it in us you ordained it god i just ask that you give us favor this morning lord may you use it lord speak to the hearts of those present let me put aside my own thoughts and previous ideas god made the holy spirit now have liberty to speak according to your divine will may the word be received lord may it bring forth according to what it is to do we act in jesus christ's name amen colossians chapter 1 verse 12 says giving thanks unto the father which has made us meek to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin who was the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth even visible and invisible whether it be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were made all things were created by him and for him now i want you to notice all things created have a purpose for which they were created they weren't just created to be created for naught they had a purpose but he had a reason for why he created what he created and why he created it that way let's keep reading and he is before all things and by him all things consists and that word consists there means have his position so he created all things for a purpose and everything he created has a position has a reason why it was put where it was placed and he is the head of the body and i notice when he starts to talk about his position he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning of the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile listen all things unto himself by him i say whether there be things in earth or things in heaven this is by our heads dear heavenly father lord i want to give you thanks for your grace and for your mercy lord we just ask this morning that you help us happy to see one of us lord let us open our eyes to see may your holy spirit anoint us plainly lord that we might be able to recognize not only our living in but god more than ever lord may we see our place in it lord i commit this service into your hands ask your divine grace in jesus christ's name may you bless your bride worldwide whether she's gathering whether she's kneeling down in prayer whatever she might be doing lord may be pleasing in your sight may you speak to her heart wherever she might be in jesus christ's name amen may be seated i want to give us a title my thought for this morning is headship friday night we dealt with leadership tonight i want to deal with headship but it's more i want to do with headship and i'm using the same subtopic because it's the same continuation of thought correctly dedicated to the word we talked about how a person can be dedicated to something but then there's a correct way to be dedicated also so even a person might say well i'm dedicated to the word the pharisees were dedicated to the word but they weren't correctly dedicated to the word and when the correction came in the form of jesus christ it revealed where they were not correctly dedicated but instead of being able to change a line up with the word that was being revealed something in them constrained them to want to hold to their previous ideas or concepts so you follow me so when god sends his word he sends his word and vindicates that word he sins for a reason because he's trying to change our mind from where we once saw things that we might see things the way god sees things because the bible says that my thoughts are not your thoughts my way is not your way said the lord because the way that he sees things is quite different than what we see as man so we actually need somebody to help us to get in line in the right way and in order to get in line the right way that's what i want to deal with this morning is headship we got to have somebody that has a higher position or a higher authority that has the right to make a decision to say i think you should go this way or i think you should go that way and in order to be able to do that you got to be willing to come under that kind of authority and that authority is called headship headship is a form of leadership it's a leadership that's determined by position not necessarily the person is smarter not necessarily the person is stronger are you following me but headship is a position and it's a position that comes by god's divine order and if you look at first corinthians chapter 11 i'd like to read to you from the scriptures what that divine order is watch god's divine order of headship paul says first corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 he said i would i would have you know that the head of every man listen is christ so the first order of headship we have to understand is man is created and man comes under the headship of what christ who is christ christ is the word and the head of the woman listen is the man so now the headship is texas is condescending we've got christ is one order over man now we've got the man over the woman but watch this and the head of christ is god so even jesus christ himself guess what he had a headship christ came to earth as a man but he didn't come to a man that the earth did it wasn't a man that came to earth that could do what he wanted to do he was a man that came to earth for a purpose and he had to fulfill the purpose of one to send him to earth or you follow me so the woman was given to the man for a purpose and christ was given to god for a purpose christ was god's body for god to use and man is christ's body for christ to use and the woman is the woman's body for the man to use for what for the purpose according to paul said for childbearing because that's the purpose for which she was given to man god created man to bring forth sons and daughters of god but man couldn't do it alone so he gave him a health meet in order for that woman to guess what be a part of that man and the purpose for which god created while you follow me so there's an order of headship and this headship comes from scripture and the scripture is for the purpose of fulfilling the program of god brother brandon said in the spoken word's original seed he said god's vision for this earth was to have a world filled with sons and daughters of god or you follow me and so there was a provided way that god had to fill this earth and that provided a way came in garden of genesis when god told adam to multiply and replenish to earth turn that with me for a minute i'd like to read that to you genesis chapter genesis chapter 1. let's read that in the scripture genesis chapter 1 verse 25 god had a vision and his vision was to have an earth full of sons and daughters and these sons and daughters guess what we're going to be like him and who is he he is the word watch what it says in genesis 1 25 and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth after this kind and god saw that it was good and god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over and over over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created him male and female created them now i want you to notice this even though god was making this man in which god was going to be head over the man this man was given supreme complete authority over the earth in which he was placed under over or you follow me brother branham described it like this he said man on earth was an amateur god whatever that man said he could speak he named the animals he could speak to the wind he could speak to the creation he could tell the wind which way to blow adam had complete complete supreme authority on earth but get this even though he had full authority he was still under a headship that authority was not to be used for adam to do what adam wanted to do that authority was to be used by the one that gave him authority and it was to do what god wanted to do or you follow me so i want you to watch this watch verse 28 and god blessed them and god created them and said be fruitful and multiply listen and replenish the earth and subdue it so right here we see god giving adam the commission i want you to bring forth not just one son you're one son of god i want you to fill a whole earth with sons and daughters of god just like you i created you by my word to live by my word and i want an earth full of sons and daughters of god that are everyone living by the word of god because the word of god is a thing that places everything and has headship over all things or you follow me so god created man for that purpose to replenish to earth but watch what man did he say repentance earth and subdue it and have dominion on the fish of the sea and over the following air and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so adam has supreme power over the earth yet with all this authority i want to point out god still had one that was high to him and that was the god that placed them there because god had placed them there for a purpose now adam didn't know all things god placed adam on earth and all adam knew was he had a commission and his commission was to subdue the earth and bring forth sons and daughters of god but in the back part of god's mind god had the whole plan laid out from genesis to revelations he knew exactly what was to take place and all adam was to do was to walk by faith in the word as god revealed the word and the thing that god gave adam and first thing in genesis was don't eat of that tree that was the first part of the word that was revealed to adam and adam failed to keep even the very first part of the word that came forth from god in order for adam to be a real son he had to be willing listen to come under the headship of the father you've given me all this all this is under my control but lord what do you want me to do with it lord you give me my life you give me my strength lord it's mine but what do you want me to do with it are you following me god gives us these things but he gives them to you for a purpose brother mike i've given you a gift to preach lord thank you for the gift but lord what do you want me to do with it are you following me i'm giving you brother uh brother gordon they get to sing but lord what do you want me to do with it he could have took that voice and maybe he could have cut a record for hollywood and made millions of dollars we don't know but he choose to use it in his pulpit what to sing praises unto the glory of god he gives you something but you have to ask him father what do you want me to do with it that's identifying your willingness to come under his headship it's yours but what does he want done with it adam had the world under control but the question was what was he going to do with it now let's watch this let's go on down a little further let's go to genesis chapter 2. and watch where adam made his mistake he had everything under control but he forfeited it watch genesis 2 15 and lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden address it and to keep it and the lord god commanded a man saying of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat thereof eat of it for the day thou eateth thereof thou shall surely die there's a reward to headship but there's also a penalty for disobeying headship we find adam was the first son of god and the natural type the bible said sparta rod spoiled a child what god is saying god is not saying abuse a child he's saying this but a child needs to have guidance he needs to have headship he needs to have somebody to train him what's the right way to do things and rest the wrong way to do things and what god was doing god gave adam the word said adam this is the right way to do things if you're going to replenish to earth you've got to do it my way and the first rule in the garden is don't touch that tree don't touch that tree but i want you to watch this look at genesis let's turn over to chapter chapter uh uh three and i want to read to you what happens when man disobeyed that scripture that word that god laid out in genesis because in ephesians chapter six it says this children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor thy father and mother listen which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou may have lived long upon the earth see when children come under headship god is saying this there's a reward for being headship but the same way there's a reward for being headship guess what there is a penalty for disobeying headship when a child disobeys their parents it's their parents responsibility to say child get back in line don't spoil the rock get back in line why you're not doing it because you're mad at a child brother brown say you're doing it because you love the child and you want to make sure that child learns the right way to walk in life so what god does by his word is he chases us not to put us under law but to begin to teach us what's the right way to work in life in other words if i put you here for my purpose don't you want to know what that purpose is if i put you here to fulfill my will don't you want to know what that will is so incumbent the headship is not as coming under a law but there's a heart that desires lord i want to know what your will is so jesus put it this way if you love me then seek my headship and keep my commandments if you love me and ask i'll tell you what i put you here for i reveal to you why you're here that you might live upon this earth and your days might be long to fulfill the will of god let me keep going now why is genesis here why is genesis genesis chapter 2 verse 15. and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden address it and to keep it and the lord god commanded a man saying of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat but the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat thereof eat of it for the day thou heat the rail now to surely die now watch chapter 3 chapter 3 verse 9. and the lord god called him to adam now this is his son now remember my tyler's headship i'm just going over some scriptures like some foundation to show you where headship came from it first began in the eden headship of father over son didn't start in deuteronomy headship of father of a son started in genesis when god created his first son he put him there for a purpose and god was dealing with his son he gave him authority but brother brown said power what without characters what satanic this first son actually compromised on what god gave him or you follow me for the desire of his wife which was a very good desire but that desire for his wife caused him to compromise on what god gave him and the position god had put him in so adam compromised on the word on behalf of his wife now watch what god says here in genesis 3 9 and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard the voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that i was naked had thou eaten of the tree well i commanded that thou shall not eat thereof and the man said the one whom thou givet to be with me she gave me of the treat and i did eat adam made his first mistake brother brown said when he hearken to the voice of his wife over listen the word of god we're never to leave the word of god for anything whatever the word says we stay with that the bible says children obey your parents how in the lord why according to the word wives obey your husband how in the lord according to the word even though there's a handship over you your headship line stops when they go outside the word so adam had an obligation to take care of his wife but whenever she left the word that obligation should have stopped or you follow me but he went beyond the word in order to please his wife and that's where the church makes stuff when people try to please the church when they try to please a ministry when they try to please each other and they go outside the word to do that we'll never do that because the word is the headship above all things the bible said obey them they have rule over you what who has spoken unto you the word of god even when it comes to the ministry if a ministry ever leaves you or anything outside of the word you're no longer obligated to that ministry the bride is obligated to one thing that's her headship and her headship is christ now i want you to watch this genesis 3 17 and adam said because thou has hearken and unto adam excuse me god said because thou was hearken to the voice of thy wife and has eaten the tree which i commanded he's saying thou shall not eat thereof or eat of it curses the ground for thy sake and sorrow thou shalt eat all the days of thy life thorns also and thistle shall bring forth to thee and thou shall eat of the herb of the field and in the sweat of thou and in the sweat of thy face thou shall leave bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it thou was taken thus thou art another dust thou shall return that was not god's original praying amen adam was never to return to the dust adam was to live eternally in the form in which god had created him so because man fell in his form god had to provide another way to bring man out of that condition where man can live on the earth eternally or you follow me now that brings us now to the second adam the second adam was christ just as the first adam had dominion over all the earth and with all his power he had he still had to come under headship we find that when the second adam came jesus christ guess what he still had to come under the same headship jesus christ as the second adam had to prove that god was able to achieve in man what the first animal failed to do he had a man that didn't live by part of the word but he finally had a man that would live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god this man christ came back under the headship of god let me keep on reading let me keep on reading first corinthians chapter 15 verse 44 still laying the foundation first corinthians 15 44. the bible says it was sown a natural body it has raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so is it written the first man adam was made a living soul listen but the last adam was made a quickening spirit christ came as the second adam the first adam was a spoken word creation by god then the second adam was the same thing he was a spoken word creation of god but when god took that spoken word of creation and put that word in the body in the book of genesis in that body man was given what was called free moral agency as long as he was a spirit he could only live as he was and that was spirit but the bible said when god put him in a body of flesh then he became a living soul brother brown said what is the soul your soul is your ability to choose he said why do you have the ability to build a house why can man build a car he said the animals never build cars they never build houses why he said they only stay in the order in which god gave them the beginning why he said they have no soul they have no ability to choose they can't think like you think they have instinct that leads them here and leaves them there but they had no soul to make a choice god gave you a soul why he wanted man to have the ability to make a choice god wanted headship but he wanted to be your choice listen to live under that headship is not looking for a people that he's gonna beat and bruise and bind to do his will god wants the people that loves him the way he loves them and they want to do his will you'll make your mistakes you'll do things wrong but when god convicts you that you say lord i'm sorry for what i've done wrong but in this headship it's based upon two points there's one that has the authority but there has to be one that's willing to submit listen unto that authority i want you to watch this it has sown a natural body it has raised a spiritual body so there's a natural body in the spiritual body as it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the second adam was made a quickening spirit that second adam came to fulfill what the first adam failed to do amen adam failed to fulfill listen the perfect will of god amen adam had sons and daughters but they were not in god's image adam had children that feel the earth but they were not in god's image god wanted sons and daughters of god that would just like his image and what was his image that was the word now watch this second adam when he comes to earth watch the mind that this second adam has hebrews chapter 10 verse 1. hebrews chapter 10 verse 1. i'm talking about headship god created adam for a purpose adam broke that purpose so god created his second adam christ and christ had just as much purpose for coming as the first adam did but watch christ's mind when he came to earth hebrews 10 verse 1 for the law having the shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices listen which they offer year by year continually make the comet of their own two perfect god was the one that established sacrifice but paul is saying this but that was not god's perfect will god never really wanted us to be in sin to begin with and when man sin animal blood because it had no soul could never help man out are you following me but watch what the word says for then what they have not ceased to be offered because the words for one's prayer should have no more conscious of sin but in those sacrifices there is remembrance again made of sins year after year listen for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins therefore when he cometh into the world now he's talking about christ now when christ come into the world he said watch his revelation as a son under full obedience he knows why he's there adam in the garden knew why he was there are you follow me in order to be obedient to headship you got to know the vision of the headship why does god want man to be ahead of his household brother brown said that man should have a vision for how he wants that house to operate before he chooses a wife he should have a vision what kind of home do i want what kind of atmosphere do i want what kind of children do i want and he chooses a woman to help fulfill that vision or you follow me and so when god gave adam eve he gave him the right kind of woman to fulfill the vision but the woman got off the word and that broke the vision and then adam got off the word and then all things fall on the scene are you following me but when christ came he came with the revelation he knew that sacrifice of animals was not satisfying to god so when he came with this revelation what was it my purpose of coming is to be the correct sacrifice because i'm the one that's going to provide god what he's been looking for ever since the fall in the garden he knew what his coming was for and he knew that god sent it for a reason and he was determined to be obedient to that headship until he fulfilled the purpose in which he came i pray god raises up a bride today that has the revelation of why were you put here and you determine your heart i'm going to fulfill the reason i was put here now watch adam the second adam and bern offers the sacrifice for sin thou has no pleasure then he said i this is christ lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o lord watch this he knew that the way to find out the mind of god the will of god it was already written in the book so when christ came to fulfill god's will it wasn't where is the will or what is the will he knew it was in the book but the only way to know his part in the book was he can only do it as god revealed it i do nothing until the father shows me what first every step of the righteous must be ordered by the lord or you follow me that's our headship so christ came the bible said as the fullness of god had bodily yet being the fullness of god he still had to bring all that power under headship are you following me watch his mind said then like come in the volume of the book it is written on me to do thy will oh god above he's saying sacrifice and offers and burning officers for sins thou would have no have no pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he christ lo i come to do thy will o god so he taketh away the first that he might establish the second by the which will listen we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once and for all now i want you to see what's happening here headship is now shifting god placed the first headship under adam multiply and replenish to earth and subdue it then god took from adam a wife listen and place her in a garden now this wife actually has an authority her job now is adam was god's agency upon earth to fulfill the word now the woman listen comes forth from the man as his agency to fulfill the word so now eve has to obey the same word that adam had to obey because the two are going to be one to fulfill the same commission what's the commission to fill the earth with sons and daughters of god so when christ came he fulfilled the first half of the crown what did he do he offered his blood to sanctify church now by that blood he's redeemed himself to a church the same way that first adam had an eve now the second adam guess what he's got now there's a second eve there's a woman on earth that was pre-ordestinated from the bosom of god to come forth out of christ for what purpose to bring forth more sons and daughters of god and on the day of pentecost what did she birth she brought broken sons and daughters of god so full of power they were speaking in unknown tongues so full of the power of god their shadow heal the sick that was god's image of sons and daughters of god upon the earth but he had to have a bride that would same way that adam was obedient to god the second animal was obedient to god now there's got to be a bride that's a beating to her handship which is christ now we're not talking about the son of god so much the son represented adam he fulfilled his part now there's a bride coming but the bride as the son was under headship so is the woman under headship as the man was under headship so must the woman be under headship and when the church misses the revelation they just see scriptures about adam and eve and about bone of my bone and flesh my flesh but what he said is you have to be what i am in order for us to be won so in order for the church of christ to be won she's got to be bold of his bone flesh of his flesh word of his word what he is she must become and she don't know what that is and the only way she can do it is by headship as he leads her into his word she sees what god has put her here for amen god brought luther out of catholicism because catholicism was wrong and luther fulfilled the word of god but when wesley came god wasn't calling him to be a lutheran he had to depend upon the mind of god to show him what's the word for your age wesley got so bogged down his ideas of what the church was all about that they formed an organization called a methodist church and brother bram said god moved out of that but then god raised up a new group of sons listen that was willing to take his word and fulfill pentecost all over again with the outpouring of pentecost of the baptism of the holy ghost brother brown said that was another work of grace god was fulfilling in his bride she wasn't dependent upon what the church said the church should be she was finding the mind of god for her age because you see headship deals with the mind what's in the mind the ability to make decisions so when you come under another man's headship what you're saying is his headship or his decision is greater than my decision i might have my ideas but i'll surrender my ideas to the one that's greater than i am or you follow me i want you to see what jesus christ said even though he was the fullness of the godhead bodily watch what christ said about his own self in saint john 14 28 he said ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again unto you if you love me you rejoice because i said i go unto the father for the father listen is greater than i i thought it was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was but listen in the form of a man i want you to get this in the form of a man all of that power of the godhead became subject to the holy ghost which was his father so the headship wasn't because god and christ were different the headship because the father was one office and the son was another office but yet the two were one brother brown said if only they would have caught that when he said i the son of man he said they didn't know they would christ the mystery he said they didn't know he was talking about what was it he was the same god only get this church come to earth in another form and in that form he made himself subject to everything you and i are subject to he could take sickness he could taste well he could taste temptation he could taste everything you and i taste yet he could do it without seeing why because he's staying under the guidance of his headship and this bride is going to be tempted in every way but how do we overcome sin by our headship amen amen don't lean to your thinking amen don't lean to your understanding but in everything listen church the bride now has the mind of christ she's following him let me give you another scripture turn the book of colossians turn the book of colossians i want you to turn it with me for a minute colossians uh no excuse me philippians philippians chapter 2 philippians chapter 2. now i want you to follow me on the start for a minute because see what i'm trying to bring out to you this morning is a very simple thought headship started in garden it started with one man under god it ended up with one man still under god but not a woman under that man but when he left the garden both the man and the woman had fallen so god's plan of redemption was to bring back a son listen now that could feel what the first son of adam didn't do by obeying every word and then give that son a wife listen now that would be fully obedient to their son that their son and their wife working together by the same word to feel god's plan was to fill this earth with sons and daughters of god amen so our coming is not to be christ as a son in that body but our coming is to be the bride of christ in this body which is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone just like the first eve was you're the second eve but this evil man said it's not like that first eve you're not going to be tempted and in guay for some ism you were called and ordained to fulfill the order of true headship by full obedience to every word of god just as the husband did so must the wife do now watch this watch philippians chapter 2 verse 5. let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought and not robbery to be equal with god so now i want you to watch this christ's mind his thinking is to be in you how is his thinking in you by his word when you can receive his word you're receiving his thinking and his thinking is his headship you're not going by your thoughts on things you're going by what he thinks about it if you take the natural type a child might decide he wants to paint his room yellow i want a yellow bedroom he's got an allowance listen he's got an allowance maybe let's say this look let's say this little boy here does or maybe he has a hobby he makes a few dollars whatever it might be he saved up his coins it don't cost by the 30 to some dollars get a can of paint he got 30 bucks he go down to lowe's he get a can of paint and all of a sudden he goes in his room and starts painting the whole room yellow he gets paint on the carpet he gets paint on the bed but when he's finished his room is yellow then mama comes in the room she said what have you done he said mama it's my room but it's my house mama it's my room but it's my house wait the father gets home now she's taking it to a higher office husband gets home honey you're gonna see what junior did he painted room yellow and got paint everywhere then the father goes in to see if the report is correct and it is that he looks at junior said but daddy is my room daddy says the same thing mama said she's only saying well god the same thing to follow it's your room but it's our house you can you don't have you're not wrong for desiring to paint your room but you don't move in this room without giving us getting the permission of the one who owns the house god gave us this earth but we don't move on this earth without getting permission from the one who gave us this earth you see how hardship works there's nothing wrong with having a desire there's nothing wrong with having a question but you got to realize who you're under the authority of and when christ came to earth he didn't want to go to calvary he said father is another way there was no sin and desire in another way but when god said there is no way my will is the only way he said then nevertheless not my will but thy will be done if adam and eve would have done the same thing the desire wasn't wrong but it was acted on the desire without consulting with your headship if even went back to adam it had been no problem if adam would know that god that had been no problem but both acted according to their own will instead of bringing everything back to the will of god amen so where we are now this world is full of denominations brother branham called them blasphemous names one called baptist one called methodist one called pentecostal one called jehovah witness what is it every church instead of being named by one name the name of christ they've taken on their own name which shows listen they're under a different headship why do we need a message to bring us out of that confusion to bring us back to one headship with one revelation with one message and that message is the mind of god and by the bride seeing that word vindicated she knows her master's voice it's the word of god vindicated in the age in which you live in noah's day he was the voice of god in that generation and his family knew if you say oh they got an art because that was their husband and that was their daddy and that was their father-in-law no sir they got in the ark because they recognized there was something different about this man his message was hard we got to build a boat for animals that don't even live in this part of the world father where are they coming from i don't know but god told me if i'll build it he said he'll bring them brother brown said he had the same problem he told his baptist church he said god ordained me with a message he said i'm going to preach around the world he said his pastor told him you had no education a seventh graders can't go preach around the world he said who's gonna listen to you he said if god gave me a message there's somebody out there that's gonna listen to it amen that's why we're here today something in you when you heard it you said that's nothing but the truth it don't mean you understand it it don't mean you can explain it but something and you recognize that's my headship that's what my heart's been hungry for that's what my life is needed i need somebody to guide me because what i don't know how to guide myself brother brown i'm saying the message of breach he said what is it he said when a man is really born again by the holy ghost he said he no longer desires his own thinking he no longer desires his own leadership and he don't want nobody to talk him into where he should go or what he should do he now is in the hand of his maker and he wants to be led by his maker wife that's his headshield the same holy ghost that led the bridegroom is the same holy ghost now leading the bride she's under a headship let me keep going philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you which is also in christ jesus what was in christ the mind of god how did the mind get there by the holy ghost i do nothing but the father shows me you see the key to this headship is not coming under rules and regulations that's called the law the key to this headship is god that created you wants to be in you and from the inside he wants to control your thinking from the inside he wants to control your thinking that's why jesus told nicodemus nicodemus you must be born again but how can i understand these things because you're not born again he is born again the only way to know the mind of god or the secret of the kingdom is first you must be born again why because god has to put his mind in you then it's no longer your thinking but now the holy ghost's in you he's doing the thinking and when you have a thought to do this something on the inside no no no no don't do that why not no no no no no we don't want to do that and if you sense it to that spirit you listen to it and it leads and guides you where into all truth but without that holy ghost you say i'm gonna try to follow this the best i can your thinking will never do it you've got to have the mind of christ literally come into you christ could have never fulfilled that part of scripture except the father was in him it's not me that do with the works but the father that dwelleth in me he's making his word live and the bride will never make this message live by trying to follow do's and don'ts it literally takes christ in you by the baptism of the holy ghost to make the world live [Music] the holy ghost brought him under headship and the holy ghost brings the bride under headship or you follow me a new nature in you now i used to want to be this way i don't want to be that way anymore i used to want to do that listen not that i think it's a bad idea i don't even want to do it anymore amen because he has once purged have no more conscience brother that word should be desire of sin i like our brother's testimony tonight he's a young brother don't despise his youth he's got a powerful testimony what was taken from him is a work of sanctification it means to be clean and set aside man in one night can't break the habit of drugs man in one night can't drink to break the habit of alcohol man in one night don't even have the ability to make that decision but if that man makes this decision god i need you and if you will help me i'll serve you if he can make that decision god has the power to break that hole of alcohol god has that power to break that hole of drugs and the same with you and i if there's something in this world holding you back you can't break it on your own self but if you can make that decision god today i'm willing to accept your headshift if you'll show me what to do father i'll follow it all the way to the end but what's missing in the church is that dedication to headship samson had to have that dedication brother bam says samson gave god his body but he wouldn't give sam god his heart his heart he gave to the world that's laodicea they come to church with their lips and say i love you but their hearts far from me it's a lukewarm condition church i don't want to be lukewarm i want to love him with my lips i want to live with my body i'm going to live in my heart and my soul i want all that i am to be given to his headship brother brown said it's going to make you unpopular people say he's a fanatic she's a fanatic you ain't got to do all that but if you love him you'll do whatever the word asks you to do you're under a different headship you're going to look strange people say why you got to be that way because that's what he's leading me to christ the disciples told christ you're strange you ain't got to go to calvary don't lord don't don't talk like that you're talking like a foolish man but the word said he was going to calvary he had to go to carry i don't care what the disciples said paul had the same problem the holy ghost said you're going to jerusalem i mean excuse me jerome to be bound and be crucified be be be uh you're going to be decapitated that's what the dust said the lord came by against my wife correct me tonight i kept saying paul was baptized by agabus he was baptized by ananias but agaves was the one that prophesied the death he was going to take in rome and when adam was prophesied watch this the believers said not so they they had a hard time accepting the will of god they love paul they didn't want to let paul go but if god said paul is departing nothing is going to stop it or you follow me and that's when real obedience to headship comes in you love the man but now you got to let him go you follow me the bride is coming to that place abraham was so committed to headship when the thing that he loved the most was his son god said offer him as much as that troubled abraham he was willing amen to let him go you see what's missing in the church is real headship that spirit of christ in a person's heart that can really reveal to that individual not the church now this is not a group revelation reveal to the individual what is god's will concerning you at this time not by the pastor's teaching not by brother mike's teaching not by no certain not even by brother branham's teaching but the holy spirit speaking to you by his word whether it's from brother brown whether from your pastor or the front brother mike you don't hear it as a man you're hearing this god's voice speaking to you and whatever god's voice is saying to you you know the voice of your headship and you say nevertheless not my will but that will be done and you will submit to whatever it takes in order to find god's perfect will and do that perfect will because wide as that male body came to sacrifice his life to fulfill the will now the bride body was created for jesus that in christ jesus he might come in you to fulfill his will [Music] let's turn to romans for a minute romans chapter 12. and i'm gonna try to read a couple of scriptures and let you go romans 12. i hope you're catching my point amen you see there was first a man under god then there was the woman under the man in genesis that was the natural but now we're dealing with the spiritual we've seen the man come back under god but now god is building a bride body that's also willing to come back under the man full headship as the man fulfill the word by god in the man now the bride the bride must fulfill the word by christ and the bride or you follow me chapter 12 romans 12 1. paul says i beseech you therefore brother and by the mercies of god watch this that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice as christ had to sacrifice his own desire to fulfill the word now by sacrificing our desires we fulfill the word listen a living sacrifice he sacrificed himself unto death you and i don't sacrifice ourselves so much to death you sacrifice yourself unto death to self amen the bible said he that's willing to lose his life shall find it so take up your cross daily you see the sacrifice daily and do what follow me whenever your desire says go this way and the word says go that way you sacrifice your desire in order to fulfill his desire because you come under his headship it don't mean y'all always going to agree christ and god didn't always agree but christ was willing to put aside his own thinking that he might agree with the decision of the father i could imagine listen to our church when christ was on earth and he was sitting there in that city i believe i forgot what city was in and here was lazarus was sick and they said word of jesus said our brother lazarus was sick come pray for him before he dies i imagine jesus wanted to get up right there and say my friend last was sick i'll go pray for him but the holy ghost said sit down amen amen and christ sat back down the holy ghost said sit one day sit two days now he's dead now you may arise and go why because the father didn't want to heal lazarus the father wanted to resurrect but it took the holy ghost to get a son that was obedient not to act upon his will but the way that god showed him what his will was what was greater for god to demonstrate he was a healer or god to demonstrate he could raise a man that was dead four days and bring him back to life what was radar are you following me brother brandon said when he went down to the gate to the pool of shalom he said there was many impotent folks sitting around thousands of them waited for the trouble underwater he said god told christ heal one man and get out of there christ went down into multitudes thousands of people sick you don't think he was on his heart he saw a mama with a sick baby that could die any day now you don't think he would heal that baby he said but god said heal one man every year when the angel came how many did angel heal one christ was not to break what god had established he was only to fulfill what god had established heal one man that's my promise to that pool and then after you heal that one man leave and all those sick people he could have commanded one word all of you get up and go home and they could have done it but in obedience to the father one man amen and god said i'm going to show you which man to heal and he had to find that one man said will thou be made whole today he said how can i and you know the story from there but christ fulfilled the will of the father every time or you follow me i beseech you therefore brother by the mercy of god that he presents your body as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is listen you're a reasonable service why is it your reasonable service listen as god brother branham said redeemed christ's body do you know he said that he said he was the first one redeemed and he said by redeeming that body god was going to use the blood of that body to redeem another body called the bride are you following me as that son was the first one redeemed that came back listen to what adam had now there's got to be a bride redeemed to come back to what eve should have had if she had not fallen or you follow me now i want you to watch this present your body a living sacrifice which is a reasonable service why because ye have been brought with a price listen and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god now let me go back to my scripture in in uh philippians and i'm a close philippians the renewing of your mind that you might prove the will of god the renewing of your mind is not teaching it's not sitting down and comparing scripture with scripture i deal with an idea renewal of your mind is revealed in philippians 2 verse 5 let the mind that was in christ jesus being you amen who being in the form of god thought it not robber to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him a form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found and fashioned as a man watched this headship now the head she put a son he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross that's gossipity wherefore god has highly exalted him now watch this obedience under headship means that god can trust the man i want you to get this now i'm closing god could trust a man to give him more once obedient has been vindicated once obedient has been identified god sees by that man's obedience listen i could trust him more amen god gave christ the holy ghost at the baptism of john but in the book of matthew 17 he didn't give him the baptism of the holy ghost he gave him an adoption what was the adoption it showed that he had been the right kind of son to fulfill the father's will to do his business and so god said i can trust that son to give him more or you follow me and then when he was willing to go to calvary god said i can trust him because he gave everything he had when he rose up from the dead he said now all power is given to me i can give him more he can be trusted and when the child in the natural shows a mom and dad they can be trusted the dad said son i want you to do this son i want to do that and when the sun shouldn't be trusted one day the sun said dad can i borrow your car he said sure son why i trust you but that's child ability and responsible that child acting crazy that's their father can't have you boy i ain't judging my car how much i pay for that car no you'll be calling me say come get me i don't run onto a bridge or hit a pole or something why he know the boy's reckless but the boy was the right kind of son when he comes a certain age the father said i can trust that boy now the church has come through seven church ages she's a mature woman what is god looking for in this age he's looking for a bride that he can marry not a second eve a woman he can look eye to eye and say that's my wife i can trust her with everything i can make her equal with me in the kingdom brother brown said all that god was he poured into christ and in this age all that christ is he sees a bride i'm gonna pour it into her i'm gonna give her the third poor wife i can trust that woman she won't do nothing with it then i wouldn't approve of first headship why do you see that pill of a clown come down like a form of a head nobody just ahead god has to have a body that that head can work through but she's got to be willing to put aside her thoughts long enough that the mind of christ can come into her let me finish reading wherefore god has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name don't you realize that when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost you take on the same name amen you carry the name of christ jesus christ wherever you go the same devils that bowed at that christ the same devil's about to his bride that bears his same name let me finish reading that at the name of jesus christ every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father now that same christ in the bride this world is going to confess she's his bride to the glory of the son god told christ i've glorified my name and conjunction i will glorify it again amen amen that name was glorified two thousand years ago in that manny are you following me now is being glorified in the woman amen same christ or you follow me as he was obedient under headship to the father we're now obedient and headship unto our husband which is the same god the father was in office listen i'm closing the sun was in office the bride the holy spirit in this age is in office same god amen same god different dispensation i'm going to read a quote to you and let you go on this quote i'm going to read this quote to you and i'm going to let you go it comes with a message standing in the gap i want you to understand how immediate this head important headship is once you watch the brother bam says and stand in the gap there's a man sitting here on the corner he said that's correct i've got a wrote down here he said it's french way back in the back blonde headed handsome looking fellow now for those that might not be for me what i'm about to read brother branham preached i believe was a businessman's breakfast and there was a young man who was a baptist that really didn't know anything about the meeting but he had to be walking by on the outside and heard music playing and he knew it was a church service and he said i'd like to go in just to be a part of the service he didn't know if there's going to be baptists in there with pentecost so he didn't know he just heard music and his name was danny henry and he came into the service and he sat down and listened to brother branham preach being the baptist knowing nothing about the supernatural and the pentecostal just hearing the word for that hour being preached by god's servant he came to brother bran after the message and said brother branham he said what you preach could have very well been the 23rd chapter of revelations he said that ain't nothing but the truth and brother baby said when he spoke those words it's so pleased the holy ghost the holy ghost came upon a man who had never spoken in tongues a day in his life and he began to prophesy about speaking in tongues are you following me he said prophesy yes brother man said tongues interpret is prophecy so he began he began the process by speaking in tongues but then the interpreters came forth with the word to interpret what he had just spoken and that's why i'm picking up the quote now i want you to watch this quote and run my title today headship and then there was a man sitting on the corner he said that's correct i've got wrote down he said it's french way back in the back of a blonde headed handsome looking fellow standing up against the wall come forward and compared notes he was interpreter the u.n for frank for french and the man over there victor luke and arne vic he said and and this is what it says listen he said victor leduc of the uh arnie vic church out there and wrote down and i've got the interpretation of it listen to it as i read it i victor leduc and a full-blooded frenchman he said born-again christian filled with the holy spirit my address is 809 north king road los angeles 46. i attend the temple the bethel temple pastor arnie vic pastor a true translation i proclaimed of the prophecy said over brother branham given by danny henry in french february 11 1961 at the full gospel businessmen's breakfast a true translation of the prophecy here is what it said now he's about to read the prophecy because thou listen has chosen the narrow path the harder way thou has walked in thy own choosing now what was a narrow way what was the heart of path it was the word of god he had to be willing of his own freeborn agency to come under that headship god never forced him god never made him as a man he had to be willing to come subject to god's headship now watch this brother man i said now i can see that moses had to make his choice too how thou now go he's going back to the prophecy how thou has picked the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way you see what he brought himself under god revealed to him what he wanted done and brother branham was willing to forsake whatever he had previously been taught to come under god's headship when god came to me as a baptist he came out of baptism so you follow me when god came into pentecostal he didn't he didn't accept the pentecostal teacher he only stayed with what god was revealing to him as the word came see under true headship god ain't obligated to reveal us the whole thing in one time but we walk in the light as he reveals the light and then we have fellowship with god or you follow me and that's exactly how the prophet did and i want you to watch this my way understand he said underline my way the holy spirit is speaking back because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee now i want you to watch this because of his decision to come on the obedience of headship he was going to be rewarded listen for his obedience christ was rewarded for his ability you're following me the bride is going to be rewarded for her obedience you will be not obeying him for reward you abandoned because you love him but because you demonstrated that love by obedience god's going to honor that with a reward so if you're doing it for the reward that's the wrong reason you do it because he's in you and you love him but because he's in you and you love him and you obeying his word at the end of the road there's a reward for all those that are obedient to him now i want you to watch this because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits you what a glorious decision brother madison listen close what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will make come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine you notice it's the verb before the adverb see the french now the u.n interpreter interpreted that now the boy knows not one word never heard never heard such thing as speaking in tongues he was a baptist just happened to drop in there heard the music and said i come up and stand up there and listen to me preach he said now in the love divine brother brown said which is divine love how can it be divine love if it isn't the holy spirit for the holy spirit is divine love by coming under headship he was actually now in a position where god could trust him amen and because god can trust him he's now about to give you a huge portion of heaven brother brown said when the prophecy first came forward he thought when i get to heaven am i going to have a big piece of property and i have a big the piece of land and god going to give me he said no the holy ghost came back and gave me revelation it's not some piece of land he said a huge portion of heaven he said what was it it was going to be a greater portion or a refilling amendment of the baptism of the holy ghost when christ received his adoption his approval of the father he didn't give him he didn't he didn't he wasn't born again but god placed authority in his hand don't hear me now hear my son i can trust him with my word what did god do that prophet so lived a life dedicated to god that when he was able to prove what god's will by the word was for this age god was so pleased with him that he actually allowed that prophet to have access what to the same sword that god had he put in his hand the spoken word this bride ain't going to get back by taking her own interpretations by having her own ideas there's only one way back to that that's by being born again by his spirit letting that spirit bring you back to his word and by that word you live in a life dedicated correctly to the word of god and when god sees that obedience living in you he said there's another one of my sons i'm ready to elevate them give them the authority of that word this is the age of full maturity luther's message won't do it's good to say i'm saved that's great it's good to say i'm sanctified that's great it's good to see i've been anointed with the gifts that cast out devils that's great but what the bride really needs is a life so sold out to god that nothing matters but what he reveals to her nothing matters if i got to lose friends let him go if i gotta lose family let him go he's not willing to lose father mother brother sister everything is not worthy of me the bride has come to the age where she's selling out everything listen i'm closing why is she selling everything it's time to go if it's time to go brother gordon what i want to hold on to if it's time to go for the friend what do i want to hold on to let go everything find a secret place where you can get along with god amen and settle in your heart lord if there's anything in my life that stands between me and full surrender to your headship reveal that to me amen david said if there'd be any we can think in my heart reveal it to me i want my life to be so dedicated not by my little dudes and don'ts my little laws little things i can do my flesh that prove to please some man and say oh look at brother mike brother mike dressed so nice and dressed so so clean the way he dressed and he treated his wife so nicely bowed to and opened the door for you can get your whole witness that can do that but when my life can testify what this book promised that the bride in this age would be that's when the father nods his head and said that's another one amen that's another one are you following me let's buy hitch the lord i want to give you thanks for your grace i want to thank you first for your love that you've given to us your word that you've given to us the word of this age to show us exactly what a son of god is supposed to be what it means to be a bride of christ what does it mean to follow leadership what does it mean to follow headship it's not laws it's not do's and don'ts it's not regulations but it's a recognition i don't know what i need to know i can't see what i need to see but if there's one that knows and one guy can see and can reveal it to me and i recognize it's the voice of god that i can hear i can recognize and under full obedience of headship i'll act on it god i want to confess my fault before to you and before his church today for not being all that i should be for not surrendering myself in the way that i should but lord i'm hoping this morning it'll be some here this morning that wants to dedicate their life to you god i'm rededicating my life to you asking that you look upon your unworthy servant and lord may you get out of me what you created me for amen may you manifest yourself in this age not just as a church member not as one that follows the message the law down to my honor to follow your message but god i so much want to live this message that when they look at me they can say there goes a message on two feet amen if you want to know what that prophet preached there it is a living epistle knowing the red of every man amen if there's any here this morning i want to dedicate your life to christ either the first time or rededication just raise your hand to god i said lord i want to dedicate my life to you i want you to have your way in me lord that you can manifest whatever your word for this age is promised let it be made manifest god bless each one of you lord my hand went up you saw the hands in his church god you saw the hands in the hearts lord that wanted to go up god i pray that you receive each one and i'm asking lord by your grace may the revelation of this word be their special portion lord we commit this church and all their present under the sound of my voice and in your hands may today they find grace in your sight we accident jesus christ's amen you know

the other night i understand she had had a seizure i just felt led to pray for her again let's everybody buy his i want to say this the word gave us a promise if we lay hands upon the sick they recover sickness comes from spirits not necessarily nothing that girl did wrong but a spirit would try to attack her even though it's a child it had nothing to do with it they brought a child of christ one time that had seizures and he laid hands upon him and prayed and cast that spirit out i want you to stand by scripture we're gonna lay hands on her and we're gonna believe that by god's grace this morning whatever that spirit is that's tormenting that child by god's grace he's going to deliver her listen by your head you believe jesus christ can heal you amen that's a good answer let's buy his lord i'm just laying my hands on her as an unworthy servant for one that's coming in your name this morning god we come against the spirit that's tried to torment this child i don't know how often is her occurred but one is one too many lord i'm committing earning your hands may this day this young child be free from that to a man and be free in the name of jesus christ lord never to come upon her again we ask this in jesus christ's name amen amen in jesus name go be well amen if there's any desire prayer for anything i want to say this these are rare opportunities why do you say red brother mike we're not going to have much longer i don't know how long we're not going to have much longer but when we're in his presence and he comes out in the service that's the time to draw from him brother braham said recognize his presence when he comes when he's present that's the time to make your request and let god answer according to his grace i'm not trying to force anybody to an altar i just want you to know when he's present there's something that you can receive just come before him expected yes my brother thank you lord we lay our hands upon our brother lord as he's bringing his body to you as a yielded vessel he just wants you to lead him and to guide him lord i'm asking this morning the name of jesus christ we come against every spirit lord that will try to confuse every spirit that we try to deceive and lord may you anoint his eyes without save that he might be able to see that he might be able to recognize what you called him for recognize what the promise of the age is and lord that may he have it find it may you find in him a willing heart to receive all that your word is revealed to him god anoint our brother by your spirit that he might be able to go in your grace and lord and be able to live a life worthy of this gospel we accident jesus christ's name amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to
