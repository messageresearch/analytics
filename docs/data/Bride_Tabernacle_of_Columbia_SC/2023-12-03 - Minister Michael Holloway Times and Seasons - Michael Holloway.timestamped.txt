[36:26] to bless our service here this morning
[36:28] if you have your Bibles I'm going invite
[36:30] you to turn me the book of Ecclesiastes
[36:31] the third
[36:33] chapter Ecclesiastes the third chapter
[36:35] we're just going to read one
[36:37] verse and I'll try not to be too long
[36:40] this morning a little bit different
[36:41] Ministry than your pastor so uh I'm not
[36:46] here to hear him preach so I don't know
[36:47] how long he preached but I got a feeling
[36:48] from knowing him it's probably not not
[36:51] very long but um and I don't typically
[36:55] preach very long either but but it might
[36:57] be just a little bit longer than you
[36:59] accustomed to so if it is just bear with
[37:01] me Ecclesiastes chapter 3:1 and before
[37:04] we read let's bow for a word of prayer
[37:07] dear heavenly father Lord I Want to
[37:08] Thank You for Your Grace this morning
[37:11] thank you for all that you've done for
[37:13] us Lord thank you for the Amazing Grace
[37:15] Lord not only to save us Lord but to
[37:18] your longsuffering to bear with us oh
[37:20] God as you work with us and work on us
[37:22] to get out of us what you created us for
[37:25] and Lord I believe we're coming to that
[37:26] hour Lord that you're looking down oh
[37:28] God and you're seeing a bride come to
[37:30] maturity oh God and it's a thing that
[37:32] you long for Lord since the foundation
[37:34] of the world lord it's right here at
[37:35] hand God help us this morning Lord to
[37:38] see our place in it just open our eyes
[37:40] by your grace we ask it in Jesus
[37:42] Christ's name amen amen Ecclesiastes
[37:45] chapter 3 just one
[37:49] verse to everything there is a
[37:52] season I really want us to catch that to
[37:56] everything thing there is a
[37:59] season and a time to every purpose under
[38:04] the heaven let's B our heads again dear
[38:06] Lord I want to thank you for the reading
[38:07] of your
[38:08] word Lord that's all we can do as a man
[38:11] I ask sincerely Lord you help us to step
[38:13] aside you know the people that are
[38:15] standing before me Lord I don't you know
[38:17] the need a very Heart Lord I pray that
[38:20] you address them Lord so I commit the
[38:22] gift in your hands we ask it in Jesus
[38:25] Christ's name May the church say amen
[38:28] amen you may be
[38:30] seated I want to take for a title this
[38:33] morning take for a
[38:36] title times and
[38:39] Seasons times and
[38:44] Seasons being humans we're creatures of
[38:47] time you know we were born in
[38:50] time each one of us if we have a birth
[38:52] certificate there's a date on it there's
[38:55] usually a Time that you were born it
[38:58] seems like everything we do in this
[39:00] world is managed by
[39:02] time as more as mortal beings we manage
[39:05] our days and our life by time and we
[39:09] understand many things in our life by
[39:11] time that doesn't make us sinful that
[39:13] just means that we're
[39:15] human but as morals we tend to plan all
[39:17] of activities around time church starts
[39:20] at a certain time church starts on a
[39:22] certain date we worry about when things
[39:25] are going to start and we get there
[39:26] we're about how long is it going to
[39:28] last this it going to be a short service
[39:30] this going to be a long service
[39:32] everything we do seems to be effective
[39:34] by
[39:35] time but if we look back at the
[39:37] scripture that Solomon is talking about
[39:39] here he's not talking about time just in
[39:41] the sense of Quantified hours and
[39:44] minutes and days he's talking about time
[39:47] in a little bit different context a
[39:49] little bit deeper thought and he's
[39:51] talking about it in terms of the purpose
[39:53] of how things relate in the junction of
[39:55] time and when they happen in time and
[39:59] that it don't just happen by
[40:01] chance these things happen at a
[40:03] certainty at a certain time by God's
[40:08] timing if you go back to Ecclesiastes
[40:10] chapter 3 again verse one I want you to
[40:13] notice here he says to everything there
[40:16] is a
[40:17] season and I want you to get this and a
[40:20] time so there's a
[40:23] season and then there Comes A Time
[40:25] listen now in that season we're going to
[40:27] get with that in a minute to every
[40:30] purpose under heaven so everything
[40:33] that's happening in these seasons and at
[40:35] certain times there's a purpose behind
[40:38] it now watch what he say these things
[40:40] and events are Salon refers to them as
[40:43] purpose and Solomon is about to give us
[40:45] some examples of what he calls seasons
[40:47] and what he refers to as
[40:50] purpose he said there's a time to be
[40:53] born Birth has a Time listen now
[40:56] birth serves a
[40:58] purpose God told Noah go forth and
[41:02] replenish the Earth the way he did it
[41:05] was what mankind has to give
[41:08] birth we're not in this time frame to
[41:11] live here forever if nobody gave birth
[41:14] guess what the human race would cease to
[41:16] exist so even in birth listen there's a
[41:18] time for it and there is a purpose for
[41:22] it are you follow me now I want you to
[41:24] watch this so there's a season for time
[41:27] and in time and there's a season for
[41:29] things to be be born if you look at
[41:31] where we are right now we in we're in
[41:33] winter but when you talk about
[41:35] Springtime what is that Springtime is a
[41:37] time for things to come forth the trees
[41:39] begin to give life and and the Animals
[41:41] begin to reproduce are you follow me
[41:43] what is it there's a certain season and
[41:45] that season is when things begin to give
[41:46] life it's a time of birth are you follow
[41:48] me so even Birth has a season and it
[41:51] serves a purpose but I want you to watch
[41:53] this spring is the season to bring new
[41:55] life but there's also also according to
[41:56] Solomon there's a time to what time to
[41:59] die we're in a season right now where
[42:02] there's certain things now that are
[42:03] dying what if you look at your flower
[42:05] beds if you women that have flower beds
[42:06] in your yard guess what there's probably
[42:08] not a whole lot of flowers in it right
[42:09] now and if there's is there's not much
[42:10] life left to it why it's a season and in
[42:13] this season we expect what to take place
[42:15] certain things to what die it's a season
[42:18] for it couple of months ago I got stung
[42:20] up in my yard doing some yard work by
[42:22] some yellow jackets in the ground that I
[42:23] didn't know were there I count felt
[42:26] sorry for the fellas when when they
[42:27] stung me I made up my mind that day I
[42:29] said I'm going to get rid of these guys
[42:30] and I went they pour me some G gas in
[42:32] the cup and I was going to finish him
[42:33] off and I felt little convient aside
[42:35] said you know what don't pour the gas on
[42:36] them I said they they were just
[42:37] protecting their nest I didn't know they
[42:39] were there if I didn't know they were
[42:40] there I'd went around them so I didn't
[42:42] kill him but guess what I said come the
[42:45] winter
[42:46] time there's a season brother Simmons I
[42:49] ain't got lay hand on them but in winter
[42:51] time because the season guess what they
[42:53] can't handle the cold so it's a time for
[42:55] them to what die but in the springtime
[42:58] The Nest that they got on their own
[42:59] guess what there'll be new life come up
[43:01] again are you f me there's a time and
[43:03] season for everything is the point I'm
[43:04] trying to make to you so winter is a
[43:06] time when we begin to see death come
[43:08] forth because there's a season where
[43:11] death serves a
[43:12] purpose when our Lord came to Earth as
[43:15] wonderful as that life
[43:17] was there was a
[43:19] season he had preached the gospel he had
[43:21] healed the sick he had confirmed the
[43:23] word but there came a season what was
[43:25] that season it was time for him to what
[43:28] die so even death serves a purpose he
[43:33] didn't die in vain he died that you and
[43:35] I might have life are you follow me so
[43:40] there's a certain purpose for
[43:42] everything and if you look at St John
[43:44] chapter 12 there was a great purpose in
[43:46] his death it says verse 24 verily verily
[43:49] I say unto you except the corn of wheat
[43:51] fall on the ground and die it abideth
[43:55] alone but if it die it bringeth forth
[43:59] what much fruit so his death was not in
[44:01] vain there was a season for it and there
[44:04] was a purpose for it that you and I
[44:06] might be here today we're the fruit of
[44:08] that death I want you to watch this now
[44:10] not only did he die death serve a
[44:13] spiritual purpose but our death listen
[44:16] now serves a purpose as well if you look
[44:19] at Romans chap 6:3 it says know ye not
[44:23] that so many of us that were baptized
[44:24] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[44:27] death therefore we are buried with him
[44:30] by baptism into death that like as
[44:33] Christ was raised from the dead by the
[44:34] glory of the father even so also we
[44:36] should walk in the newness of Life by
[44:39] his death came a birth and by our death
[44:42] comes a new birth are you following me
[44:44] there's a season for these things and
[44:47] there's a purpose for these things now
[44:49] we might not always understand what God
[44:51] is doing but I'm just trying to give you
[44:53] some samples or some examples to go by
[44:55] as I begin to to build a platform we
[44:57] might not always understand God's season
[44:59] and God's purpose but I'm hoping this
[45:01] morning that this message will help us
[45:02] to understand a little bit better the
[45:03] season you in right now but every action
[45:06] under Heaven Solomon says has a purpose
[45:10] now let's not limit this thought to our
[45:12] purpose because the scripture is not
[45:14] emphasizing our purpose if you read it
[45:16] carefully Solomon is emphasizing God's
[45:20] purpose if you look at Ecclesiastes chap
[45:22] 3:1 I want to read that to you because I
[45:25] want you to understand we talking
[45:26] purpose I'm not talking about our
[45:27] purpose I'm not talking about your
[45:29] purpose I'm talking about God's purpose
[45:31] if you look at chapter 3: 11 Solomon
[45:33] says he has made everything beautiful in
[45:37] listen his
[45:39] time so this season and his times and
[45:42] his purpose is not our season it's not
[45:45] our time it's his season and his time
[45:47] and it's also his purpose cuz Paul said
[45:51] ye are called according to his purpose
[45:54] not your purpose I want us to get there
[45:56] now watch this notice the next word in
[45:59] his time he had made everything
[46:01] beautiful in his time also he has set
[46:04] the world in their heart that's speaking
[46:05] of you and I that's mankind he set the
[46:08] world in our heart so that no man can
[46:10] find out the work that God maketh from
[46:12] the beginning to the end so even though
[46:14] he has a time and he has a season and he
[46:17] has a purpose he so arranged this thing
[46:20] Solomon said that you and I will never
[46:22] figure out what his time is you'll never
[46:24] figure out what his purpose is but the
[46:27] only way to know brother Simmons is by
[46:28] his grace he's got to reveal it to you
[46:31] because we'll never by our human
[46:33] thinking figur out his time his season
[46:36] or his purpose but now watch this I want
[46:39] to get into his purpose this morning so
[46:42] every work that is to serve his purpose
[46:45] but his true purpose is a mystery to
[46:47] mankind although we listen play a part
[46:50] in it Although our natural ease will see
[46:53] our eyes will see it as it's coming in
[46:55] the pass I walked in this morning I
[46:57] appreciate hearing your pastor as he was
[46:59] dealing with the Sunday school and he
[47:00] was trying to tie in as he Springs me
[47:02] the back Daniel 70 weeks and some things
[47:04] that the prophet said and this morning I
[47:06] heard him come I came in I heard him
[47:07] talk about Israel and what was happening
[47:09] over there right now in this war do you
[47:11] realize this is in scripture what's
[47:14] taking place over there is not just the
[47:15] world looks at as a national event how
[47:17] can we have peace talks this is not
[47:19] about peace talks there'll be no peace
[47:21] until shallow come what we're seeing is
[47:23] scripturally fulfilled but guess what
[47:25] it's a season that Israel's got to enter
[47:27] this battle because why it's the season
[47:30] for it and it was in the scripture foret
[47:32] told that it was coming now watch this
[47:35] we can see what's happening a lot of
[47:37] times but can we really discern what
[47:39] we're looking at I want to take my time
[47:43] we can see it but can we discern really
[47:46] what we're looking at look at
[47:48] Ecclesiastes again verse chapter 3 verse
[47:49] 11 and he has set the world in their
[47:52] heart speaking of man so that no man can
[47:54] find out the work that God maketh from
[47:56] the beginning to the end God has so
[47:58] arranged a thing that man cannot figure
[48:00] out what he is doing yet God has
[48:03] foretold every major event in time that
[48:06] he has predestinated for man and he
[48:09] placed it listen right here in the word
[48:13] so what God is doing is not something
[48:16] that's so much hidden in the corner he's
[48:18] placed it in plain sight in his word but
[48:20] it will take the Holy Spirit to anoint
[48:22] your eyes it'll take the Holy Spirit to
[48:24] anoint my eyes to recognize what's in
[48:26] the world in the word and then look at
[48:28] the world around us and be able to place
[48:30] what we're seeing right back in the word
[48:33] and then when you can see it by the word
[48:35] then and only then can you really
[48:37] recognize what God is doing people can
[48:41] try to surmise what they think he's
[48:42] doing they can try to pontificate on
[48:44] what he's doing but they'll never really
[48:46] know what he's doing until God himself
[48:49] takes it back and reveals it by the word
[48:51] now I want you to watch this so he
[48:53] placed it here in the word and all we
[48:54] got to do is ask for for God to open our
[48:56] eyes to show us the time that we're
[48:58] living in let me show what I mean by
[49:00] this many young kids recognize the days
[49:03] of
[49:04] Noah what was that season you'll ask
[49:08] them oh that's when the flood came and
[49:10] everything died the little child could
[49:12] tell you that it was a season of death
[49:16] now listen to me now the little church
[49:18] could tell you that from Sunday school
[49:20] you can ask some same little kids what
[49:22] about Moses oh Moses was the deliverer
[49:25] they can recognize there was a time that
[49:28] the prophet told us a nation was being
[49:30] born out of a Nation it was a time of
[49:32] birth but they might not looked at his
[49:34] birth but when they came out God said
[49:36] that was my son God saw his son not just
[49:39] the people his son being born out of a
[49:42] Nation or you follow me it was a time to
[49:44] be born but yet when little kids look at
[49:46] the Bible they can tell you the story
[49:48] but they can't understand what God was
[49:50] doing but that was for another age you
[49:53] and I don't want to just know what God
[49:54] did in that age the same way there was a
[49:56] purpose in what he was doing there right
[49:58] now where you're sitting and living
[50:00] there's a purpose to what God is doing
[50:03] now let me go a little
[50:05] further when they came out of Egypt it
[50:07] was a season of time to be born because
[50:10] why everything that was happening at
[50:12] that time listen was pre-planned
[50:14] God told Abraham 400 and something years
[50:18] before they came out of that Nation he
[50:20] said this is what I'm going to do and he
[50:23] revealed them by his word to Abraham and
[50:25] yet they knew by the word certain events
[50:27] was supposed to happen but when they
[50:28] were happening they didn't recognize
[50:30] them and they thought Moses came as a
[50:32] troublemaker but Moses was not a
[50:34] troublemaker he was actually the man God
[50:36] was using to fulfill his word but to the
[50:39] people he was a troublemaker and when
[50:41] John the Baptist came it was a season
[50:44] but what did the church think they
[50:45] thought he was a troublemaker he was not
[50:47] a troublemaker he was the man God was
[50:49] using to fulfill the word in this season
[50:53] and in our age there something happening
[50:55] God is is not stiring trouble to be
[50:56] stiring trouble but what is it doing
[50:58] bringing a division because this is the
[50:59] age where the righteous and unrighteous
[51:01] is going to be divided let me keep going
[51:04] let me keep going everything that's
[51:06] happening listen now is pre-planned
[51:09] get that now just like those ages were
[51:13] pre-planned
[51:14] this age you're living in Sister it was
[51:18] pre-planned and I want you to understand
[51:20] something you were pre-planned with
[51:23] it Moses didn't show up by chance he was
[51:27] planned to be there Israel wasn't a
[51:30] nation by chance God planned it to be
[51:32] there John didn't have them a chance God
[51:34] planned them to be there the Pharisees
[51:36] weren't there by chance God planned them
[51:38] to be
[51:40] there but Jesus said if you only
[51:42] recognized your season you wouldn't act
[51:45] the way you were acting are you follow
[51:47] me but those that recognized it were
[51:50] blessed when they recognize their
[51:52] season what are you get the holway
[51:55] I want you to recognize your
[51:58] season I want you to be a part of that
[52:00] blessed group that recognize your season
[52:04] now watch
[52:05] this all things were pre-planned they
[52:09] were clearly foretold by God but yet
[52:11] there were a mystery in his promised
[52:14] word he said when there would be and he
[52:17] said what would happen when the season
[52:18] came and he said what the Believers
[52:20] would do when that time came so there is
[52:23] a time and a season for everything and
[52:25] there was a time and a season for me to
[52:27] be born and there's a purpose for
[52:29] Michael Hollow to be born and not just
[52:31] be born but there's a purpose for
[52:32] Michael Hollow to be born at this time
[52:35] remember now not my purpose to be born
[52:39] his purpose for me to be born you
[52:42] understand now watch
[52:44] this God had a spiritual purpose in my
[52:47] birth and so did he have one in yours
[52:51] those little girls sitting in front of
[52:52] me they might have a mom and daddy in
[52:55] this church church right now they're
[52:57] here cuz they're here with
[52:58] parents but there's a purpose in them
[53:00] sitting there you said brother H explain
[53:02] it to me I can't brother Simmons might
[53:05] not be able to explain it but listen
[53:07] there's a purpose in them being there
[53:08] now watch this brother Brown said this
[53:10] in a message things ought to
[53:12] be he said you were all pre-planned by
[53:17] God put yourself in that you are all
[53:21] pre-planned by God nothing happens by
[53:23] chance they're not didn't here by chance
[53:26] you say they here because their mama's
[53:27] here that might be our thinking but God
[53:29] might be thinking something different
[53:31] one of them two ladies might be the Lexi
[53:33] that's about to have a body change and
[53:36] God wanted to put them under the opice
[53:37] of the word that they might hear
[53:39] something that could literally change
[53:41] their
[53:43] bodies they're not hanging out with Mama
[53:45] they're here for a
[53:47] purpose listen nothing happens by chance
[53:50] with God he know it all about it it's
[53:53] all pre-planned plann before many
[53:55] generations back so that you could be
[53:57] here tonight you're here right now
[54:00] because God pre-planned it you're not in
[54:02] this church by accident I'm not in my
[54:04] home Church by accident we come to
[54:06] places of Fellowship because you might
[54:07] think I'm here because of so and so I'm
[54:09] here because of it is but brother Brown
[54:11] said no sir if you're a seed of God God
[54:13] pre-planned it watch
[54:16] this he said did you know that the
[54:19] congregation
[54:20] amen this mystery of his time and season
[54:24] was purpose by him and God has hid those
[54:27] things in the word but he has also
[54:29] revealed them in types and shadows in
[54:32] nature let's go back to Solomon again
[54:34] let's go back to Ecclesiastes 3 I'm
[54:35] laying a foundation because I want you
[54:36] to understand something there's times
[54:38] and there's seasons and there's
[54:39] relevance to times and seasons and if
[54:41] you don't know your time and season you
[54:43] can be walking right past something and
[54:45] don't even realize what you're walking
[54:46] right past but if you can recognize your
[54:48] time and season listen you begin to look
[54:50] for
[54:52] things you know I got these flowers that
[54:54] come my yard but every year I didn't
[54:56] plant those flowers when I bought my
[54:57] house 20 years ago the people that owned
[54:59] my house before I got there they knew a
[55:01] whole lot more about Garden than I do
[55:03] because they that was a pretty pretty
[55:04] landscape when I bought it ain't as
[55:06] pretty as it used to be CU I don't know
[55:08] how to keep it like they kept it but 20
[55:09] years later brother Simmons it's still
[55:11] producing why cuz they knew what they
[55:13] were doing but I understand certain
[55:15] Seasons now because when certain times
[55:17] come around certain things in my yard
[55:19] begin to bloom and when the season
[55:21] changes I begin to expect it because I
[55:24] know the season and I know the potential
[55:26] of what them people 20 years ago planted
[55:28] in my yard if you can understand what
[55:31] God planted before the foundation of the
[55:33] world and recognize your season you
[55:35] begin to expect certain things because
[55:38] it's the
[55:41] season
[55:43] listen Ecclesiastes 2 a time to be born
[55:46] and a time to die a time to plant and
[55:49] the time to pluck up that which is
[55:51] planted now listen this is nature
[55:54] Solomon is looking looking at and God
[55:56] hides himself listen in nature watch
[56:01] what the prophet said about nature God
[56:02] accepted his provider we're at the end
[56:03] time let me take something in nature
[56:07] because nature listen what he says was
[56:09] my first Bible not the King
[56:14] James
[56:15] nature nature was my first Bible I know
[56:19] God is a Creator and he created nature
[56:22] and he lives in his Creation in nature
[56:25] natur the prophet said my first Bible
[56:27] was nature and the reason it was a Bible
[56:30] because nature can reveal
[56:34] God you said brother holl where you get
[56:36] that from look at what Paul said you
[56:38] believe Paul's writing let's go to
[56:39] Romans chapter 1 watch what Paul said in
[56:41] Romans 1 Romans 1:18 Paul says for the
[56:45] wrath of God is revealed from Heaven
[56:47] against all unrighteous ungodliness of
[56:49] men who hold a truth in unrighteousness
[56:52] because that which may be known of God
[56:54] is manifest best King James says in them
[56:57] but the right translation is to them God
[57:00] has showed it to them when I watch how
[57:02] God showed it to him for the invisible
[57:04] things of him that's God from the
[57:07] creation of the world are clearly seen
[57:09] being understood by things that are made
[57:12] that's his creation if you want to
[57:14] understand God Paul is saying you can
[57:16] see him in his creation if you know what
[57:18] you're looking at do you understand so
[57:21] the prophet said he didn't first see God
[57:23] in the Bible he first saw in his
[57:25] creation and Paul said even a mystery of
[57:27] the godhead can be understood by simply
[57:30] looking at
[57:33] nature now I want to show you if you
[57:35] want of those little times of season
[57:37] learn nature cuz all of nature that we
[57:39] know about is governed by what
[57:42] times and Seasons now watch this watch
[57:47] this even God's deepest Mysteries can be
[57:50] understood by nature and we can begin to
[57:53] understand his purpose in it
[57:55] if you look at brother Bram said the
[57:56] message the Harvest time he said now
[57:59] that's how we find God sometime listen
[58:02] is to look into
[58:04] nature now the reason I'm taking my time
[58:06] and showing you Paul I'm taking my time
[58:08] and show what this Prophet said is
[58:10] because I'm going to talk a little bit
[58:11] today a lot today about nature and I
[58:13] want you to understand why I'm focused
[58:15] on nature because the prophet said it
[58:16] and Paul said it sometimes if you want
[58:19] to know God's Mysteries both prophets
[58:21] pointed us Back To Nature
[58:25] brother B said now that's how we find
[58:27] God sometime is to look in nature
[58:30] seasons rotating around proves God
[58:32] that's where I first found it now these
[58:36] prophets use nature look at John the
[58:38] Baptist Matthew chap 3:9 when John was
[58:41] preaching his message John used nature
[58:44] to reveal the Revelation that he had
[58:46] watch how John did it St Matthew chapter
[58:49] 3:9 and think not to say within
[58:51] yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father
[58:54] for I say unto you that God is able of
[58:56] these stones to raise up children PR
[58:58] what did he do he's now pointing Back To
[59:00] Nature watch this and now also the ax is
[59:03] laid to the root of the trees wherefore
[59:06] every tree that bringeth forth not good
[59:07] fruit is hooed down and cast where Into
[59:10] the Fire what is he doing he's preaching
[59:12] a message and you might just say it's a
[59:14] parable but it's more than a parable he
[59:16] had a revelation and to help them
[59:18] understand that where did he take him
[59:19] back to brother he took him back brother
[59:21] Gordon to Nature now watch this
[59:25] John was preaching the revelation of yah
[59:26] but he did it using nature now I want
[59:28] you to look at Jesus Jesus preached his
[59:31] message and what did he use nature look
[59:34] at St John chap 15 verse 5 he says I am
[59:37] the vine ye are the branches he that
[59:40] abideth in me and I in him the same
[59:42] bringeth forth much fruit but without me
[59:45] listen ye can do nothing now he's
[59:49] talking about Vines and branches I want
[59:51] to know about the word brother Simmons I
[59:52] don't want to know about Vines and
[59:53] branches but what he was doing he was
[59:55] using Vines and branches to reveal the
[59:58] word what was he preaching the mystery
[1:00:00] of Pentecost and that was the promise of
[1:00:03] that
[1:00:04] age but how was he revealing it through
[1:00:07] nature now watch this Jesus used nature
[1:00:10] to reveal Pentecost look at Acts chapter
[1:00:12] 1 and watch the Fulfillment of what he's
[1:00:14] talking about acts chap 1 verse4 and
[1:00:17] being assembled together with them
[1:00:19] commanding them they should not depart
[1:00:21] from Jerusalem but wait for the promise
[1:00:23] of the Father which you said ye have
[1:00:25] heard of me for John truly baptized with
[1:00:27] water but you should be baptized with
[1:00:29] the Holy Ghost not many days hence you
[1:00:32] can't do nothing without me you stay
[1:00:34] here till you get the Holy Ghost cuz
[1:00:35] it's the life of the vine that's got to
[1:00:37] work through the branches he was
[1:00:39] preaching a
[1:00:41] Pentecost but to the carnal mind they
[1:00:43] say oh he's talking about nature he
[1:00:45] ain't talking about nature he was
[1:00:46] revealing the hour by the nature that he
[1:00:48] was living or
[1:00:50] seeing that's what I'm getting I want to
[1:00:52] take you into nature this morning but I
[1:00:54] want to show you brother Hollow ain't
[1:00:56] some limb bringing some crazy typology
[1:00:58] the prophets use nature John use nature
[1:01:01] Solomon preach nature Jesus preached
[1:01:03] nature and our own Prophet preached
[1:01:05] nature I want to deal with nature CU I
[1:01:08] want you to see your
[1:01:10] time in your
[1:01:12] season you see we can coast
[1:01:15] along and say I'm in the
[1:01:17] message and and mean that I'm not
[1:01:19] talking about
[1:01:20] hypocrites sincere hearted people my
[1:01:23] brother believe it
[1:01:26] but you're in the message the message
[1:01:28] came in a certain
[1:01:29] season but now what time are you in that
[1:01:33] season you understand me you can say I'm
[1:01:36] in the summertime what as the beginning
[1:01:38] of
[1:01:39] summertime and then there's the fading
[1:01:41] out of
[1:01:42] summertime where are you in
[1:01:44] summertime do you understand I want to
[1:01:47] know that I'm in the
[1:01:48] message but I want to see my season cuz
[1:01:52] if I know my season then I know what to
[1:01:54] expect listen in that season because you
[1:01:58] could be in the season and be looking
[1:01:59] for the wrong thing let's look at the
[1:02:01] scriptures and the types of Nature and
[1:02:04] see our season let me go a little
[1:02:06] further you see God is in his
[1:02:09] message and he's using nature to express
[1:02:12] it so our Prophet did the same thing he
[1:02:16] used nature to bring out certain things
[1:02:19] even our time and our season and the age
[1:02:22] in which we living and what God has
[1:02:24] doing right now in that age if you look
[1:02:27] at the message trying to do God of
[1:02:28] service without being his will brother
[1:02:30] BR says even nature itself tells us
[1:02:33] today as we see the Nations breaking the
[1:02:37] Earth sinking in the
[1:02:40] handwriting is on the wall how do you
[1:02:44] know it brother Adam looking at the
[1:02:46] Nations I'm looking at the Nations but
[1:02:49] then I take National events Back To
[1:02:53] Nature
[1:02:55] well what's happening how does National
[1:02:56] events have anything to do with nature
[1:02:58] the Bible said there's a time to be
[1:03:02] born what did Brother Brown say National
[1:03:04] events was revealing he said as I begin
[1:03:06] to see these nations rise up and I begin
[1:03:08] these wars rising up he said what is it
[1:03:11] he said this world is going through a
[1:03:13] birth
[1:03:14] pain he said the first world war he said
[1:03:17] was a birth pain he said the second
[1:03:20] world war was a birth pain and when he
[1:03:23] began to see the tension rise up he said
[1:03:25] what is it leading to he said it's
[1:03:26] leading us to another world war he said
[1:03:28] to the final birth plane before A New
[1:03:31] Earth comes forth he saw the birth of a
[1:03:34] new Earth what is that birth it's called
[1:03:36] the Millennium this Kingdom won't be
[1:03:38] about ruled by man it'll be ruled by
[1:03:40] Jesus Christ but before that kingdom
[1:03:42] comes in and gives birth there's got to
[1:03:44] be a bride that leaves here before a
[1:03:46] millennium sets
[1:03:48] in so he's looking at natural event
[1:03:51] headlines and he's taking it back to
[1:03:53] Nature
[1:03:55] because before that birth comes forth
[1:03:57] somebody else has got to go now watch
[1:03:59] this cuz when he comes back to give the
[1:04:01] New Kingdom guess who comes back with
[1:04:04] him so we got to go before he comes back
[1:04:07] so when he comes back we could be with
[1:04:08] him when he comes now watch
[1:04:10] this he was looking at world events by
[1:04:13] nature and he could recognize this world
[1:04:14] was falling apart and he recognized that
[1:04:17] in order for the New Kingdom to come in
[1:04:19] that this Old Kingdom has to die away he
[1:04:21] was revealing Nature by prophecy now
[1:04:23] watch the rest of this statement even
[1:04:25] nature itself tells us today that we see
[1:04:26] Nations breaking the Earth is sinking in
[1:04:28] the handwriting is on the wall we see
[1:04:31] the church and the state it's in we see
[1:04:34] the bride listen and the state she's in
[1:04:38] this is what I want to deal with the
[1:04:40] state that the church is in and the
[1:04:44] state that the bride is in watch this
[1:04:47] and We Know by Nature look at what he
[1:04:49] looking at that the church is getting
[1:04:51] ready to leave here if you can see the
[1:04:55] condition the church is in and if you
[1:04:57] can see the condition the bride is in
[1:05:00] then you know what happens in that
[1:05:01] season and it changes your expectation
[1:05:04] and what did it do for the prophet when
[1:05:06] he could place those things by nature
[1:05:09] and by the word he said I see something
[1:05:11] the bride is getting ready to leave here
[1:05:15] let me keep going what a glorious time
[1:05:18] it's a time that all the prophets have
[1:05:19] longed to see now watch this why could
[1:05:22] he be so sure the church was leaving but
[1:05:24] because the final birth pain which was
[1:05:25] World War I he could see that that war
[1:05:28] was at the door and according to
[1:05:30] scripture this bride was going to be
[1:05:31] going before it happens now watch this
[1:05:34] how did he know God's church was getting
[1:05:35] ready to leave the Earth he saw it in
[1:05:37] nature and nature themed up with the
[1:05:40] written word of God so the prophet could
[1:05:43] see the coming of the Lord by watching
[1:05:44] nature and scripture look at St Luke 21:
[1:05:48] 29 and he spake to them a parable behold
[1:05:52] the Fig Tree and all the trees
[1:05:54] now what is he doing he's going back
[1:05:56] where nature now I'm going to take my
[1:05:59] time on this little part here what does
[1:06:01] he using nature to do he's using nature
[1:06:04] to show the coming of the Lord where did
[1:06:08] he get that idea from Jesus used nature
[1:06:12] to show his
[1:06:15] coming are you following me now watch
[1:06:18] this and he spake to them a parable
[1:06:20] Behold a fig tree and all the other
[1:06:22] trees and when they shoot forth listen
[1:06:25] ye know of your own self that summer is
[1:06:27] not at hand so Jesus saying when you see
[1:06:30] certain things take place it's a sign
[1:06:32] you're in a changing season and when the
[1:06:35] season is coming you should know what
[1:06:37] happens next in that season now watch
[1:06:39] this so likewise when you see these
[1:06:41] things come to pass know ye that the
[1:06:44] kingdom of God is what not at hand if
[1:06:49] you can see the season and you can see
[1:06:50] the signs you know what's happening next
[1:06:53] now whates watch what he's doing this
[1:06:55] Prophet I'm speaking of he's revealing
[1:06:57] prophecy by using nature to reveal what
[1:07:00] God had hidden inside his heart Matthew
[1:07:02] Chapter 13 Verse 24 another Parable put
[1:07:06] he forth saying unto them the Kingdom of
[1:07:07] Heaven is like unto a man which sold
[1:07:09] good seed in the field but while men
[1:07:11] slept his enemy came in and S tears
[1:07:14] using nature Amongst the Wheat and went
[1:07:18] his way and when he Blaze was sprung up
[1:07:20] he brought forth fruit then appeared
[1:07:22] tears also so the servant of the
[1:07:24] household came and said unto him s did
[1:07:26] thou not sow good seed in thy field from
[1:07:29] whence has it tears and he said unto
[1:07:30] them the enemy has done this the servant
[1:07:32] said unto him will thou that we go and
[1:07:34] gather them up but he said nay least
[1:07:37] while you gather up the tears you root
[1:07:38] up also the wheat with them let them
[1:07:40] both grow together listen until the
[1:07:42] Harvest brother Hol what are you talking
[1:07:44] about I'm talking about the Rapture
[1:07:47] Christ is using Parables of nature to
[1:07:50] hide the mystery of his coming now to
[1:07:53] some people people had to bypass that
[1:07:55] and say oh it's a parable oh it's nature
[1:07:57] you're bypassing the very thing that God
[1:08:00] hid himself in but for the elect they
[1:08:02] see it and recognize the season now
[1:08:05] watch this he's talking about the
[1:08:07] Rapture and he's hiding the mystery in
[1:08:09] nature and in the time of the Harvest
[1:08:11] watch what he says I will say to the
[1:08:12] Reapers gather you together first the
[1:08:14] tears and bind the bundles for them to
[1:08:16] be and bind the the bundles to burn but
[1:08:19] gather you the weed in the BN what is he
[1:08:21] saying at the time of the Rapture
[1:08:22] there's going to be a separate ation
[1:08:24] there's going to be two Gatherings first
[1:08:26] is going to gather the bundles of the of
[1:08:28] of the tears then the weed is gathered
[1:08:31] to the barn brother man said what was
[1:08:34] that first Gathering it was the World
[1:08:36] Council of churches coming together but
[1:08:39] as they came together he said what was
[1:08:40] to happen next the bride was to get
[1:08:42] ready to get out of here and we've
[1:08:44] already seen the Gathering of the World
[1:08:46] Council what season over here the bride
[1:08:49] should be expecting it's time to get out
[1:08:51] of
[1:08:52] here but we we getting comfortable in
[1:08:54] churches I'm not speaking of this church
[1:08:56] I'm talking around the message that ho
[1:08:58] my church we get comfortable with church
[1:09:01] we think that next Sunday we'll be here
[1:09:02] for the next service we think that next
[1:09:04] year we'll be here for the next New
[1:09:05] Year's everything is always time time
[1:09:07] look into the future but there's going
[1:09:08] to come a time when time ceases and God
[1:09:11] takes her home but for those that
[1:09:12] recognize the season they were looking
[1:09:14] for
[1:09:16] it cuz they're recognize their
[1:09:18] season when it came time for Jesus to go
[1:09:21] to Calvary did it take him by surprise
[1:09:25] he saw a
[1:09:26] season when Paul was going home did he
[1:09:28] take him by surprise he saw a season
[1:09:32] when the flood came to take Noah by
[1:09:34] surprise he start a season are you
[1:09:37] follow me these people knew how to
[1:09:40] recognize their season and what God was
[1:09:43] about to do how much more the elect
[1:09:46] bride of Jesus Christ she's gone beyond
[1:09:49] just church she knows that there's a
[1:09:52] season she was born in
[1:09:54] and there was a purpose for That season
[1:09:57] and she's looking for her life listen to
[1:09:59] manifest that purpose that God put her
[1:10:02] here for in this season let me go a
[1:10:05] little bit further so Jesus Christ was
[1:10:08] preaching the the mystery of his coming
[1:10:10] by dealing with the the the the the the
[1:10:13] parable of the wheat and the wheat being
[1:10:15] gathered was speaking of the Harvest
[1:10:17] Time and the Harvest Time speaks of the
[1:10:19] Rapture which is the time listen I'm
[1:10:21] going to get ahead of myself which is
[1:10:22] the time you and I are in now now we're
[1:10:24] not in the time where the seed was
[1:10:27] sewn seed sewing is
[1:10:30] over you're in the time that the wheat
[1:10:34] is now about to be gathered into the
[1:10:38] barn we're late in the stage we're late
[1:10:41] in the game and I want to make sure if
[1:10:44] I'm in that season where the reach spot
[1:10:45] to go home I want to make sure I'm weat
[1:10:48] ready to go
[1:10:50] home now watch this one group be taken
[1:10:54] another group is going to be left
[1:10:55] because that's the season we in because
[1:10:58] God uses his Harvest to represent the
[1:11:02] Rapture let me go a little bit further
[1:11:04] James chapter 5: 7 how many still with
[1:11:07] me I'm only using nature to show your
[1:11:10] season and I'm STI I'm trying my best to
[1:11:12] stick with scripture and stick with the
[1:11:14] message to show you that we're supposed
[1:11:16] to by the scripture and by Nature see
[1:11:19] God watch the James says James chapter 5
[1:11:22] I'm going to give you another apost
[1:11:24] James 5:7 be patient therefore Brethren
[1:11:27] unto the what come to the Lord back to
[1:11:30] the Rapture again notice a
[1:11:33] parallel behold the husband man waiteth
[1:11:36] for the precious
[1:11:38] what we Back To Nature again when you
[1:11:41] start talking about raptures when you
[1:11:43] start talking about this mystery of his
[1:11:44] coming there's something about nature
[1:11:46] that God says if you'll just catch
[1:11:49] it it's your coming it's my coming it's
[1:11:53] your going home and it's right there in
[1:11:57] front of you in nature watch this Behold
[1:12:01] a husband man waited for the precious
[1:12:03] fruit of the earth he has long patience
[1:12:05] for it
[1:12:10] listen until he receive the early and
[1:12:12] the latter rain be patient and establish
[1:12:16] your hearts listen this is what I want
[1:12:18] to get to this is my message brother BR
[1:12:20] taught on this establish your hearts for
[1:12:22] the coming
[1:12:24] of the Lord draw
[1:12:27] nigh he didn't
[1:12:29] say brother get
[1:12:31] saved he said establish your
[1:12:34] hearts to the believer who's looking is
[1:12:37] now time to if you ever was a time you
[1:12:40] turn your head to Christ listen this is
[1:12:43] that time if there was every time you
[1:12:46] sought the Lord to understand what he's
[1:12:48] doing and who you are and why you here
[1:12:49] this is that time it's time for us to
[1:12:51] turn our attention not part of the world
[1:12:53] world not part of Christ but it's time
[1:12:55] for the real believer to turn his heart
[1:12:57] holy to what the thing that's drawing
[1:12:59] him because body life has one thing to
[1:13:02] draw it is not the water it's not the
[1:13:04] dirt what draws the body life the
[1:13:07] sun my wife is not a farm over she'll
[1:13:10] tell you from growing little plants in
[1:13:11] her house if you take a plant and sit in
[1:13:13] the corner it could be leaning to the
[1:13:15] right but if the sun rises on the left
[1:13:17] that PL in a day or two or do what it'll
[1:13:19] turn completely around why cuz the sun
[1:13:21] draws the life and if you got life in
[1:13:24] you the sun right now is drawing on that
[1:13:30] life pulling you to himself now watch
[1:13:36] this they talking about Harvest Time so
[1:13:39] the prophet saw the time in which we was
[1:13:41] living in and he compared it with two
[1:13:43] things the prophet saw it in the word
[1:13:46] but he also saw it in nature now watch
[1:13:49] what it says in the
[1:13:50] Masterpiece because I want you this now
[1:13:52] this is where I'm going to turn the
[1:13:53] corner a little bit Watch what it says
[1:13:54] his Masterpiece notice it started out as
[1:13:57] the original this is Pentecost as Jesus
[1:14:00] said the word of God is a seed that the
[1:14:02] SE sow and he was the so and the seed
[1:14:06] was the word now I want you to watch
[1:14:08] this this is where many theologians miss
[1:14:11] it the seed was the word and notice any
[1:14:15] seed that abides alone never does
[1:14:18] nothing it's got to fall into the ground
[1:14:21] to bring forth its productive again so
[1:14:24] now Christ is telling us that no seed
[1:14:26] that abides alone if you take that seed
[1:14:29] and you put it up here on this pull pit
[1:14:31] and I don't care how much sunlight you
[1:14:32] or how much light you have shine on it
[1:14:34] it'll never produce a plant why it needs
[1:14:36] to go into the ground it's got to get
[1:14:38] into the ground where the dirt actually
[1:14:40] breaks down the outside around it and
[1:14:42] then the life that's hidden that seed
[1:14:44] has a chance to grow and establish roots
[1:14:46] and it can't do it on the pull pit it's
[1:14:47] got to die and go into the ground to do
[1:14:50] it now watch
[1:14:52] this and the seed that perfect Church
[1:14:55] fell into the ground at n Rome now watch
[1:14:58] this whenever Jesus Christ said except
[1:15:01] the corn of wheat falling to the ground
[1:15:03] it abideth alone every Theologian
[1:15:06] brother Simons appointed that to Jesus
[1:15:08] Christ and guess what he was the seed
[1:15:12] and he did go into a ground but it took
[1:15:14] a message to tell us that the scripture
[1:15:16] has a calm pound meaning many times when
[1:15:19] God speaks a word it doesn't speak to
[1:15:21] just one generation that same scripture
[1:15:23] can guess what apply to more than one
[1:15:26] generation but it takes a prophet to
[1:15:28] bring out how to apply that seed to your
[1:15:30] generation it's not for me to figure out
[1:15:32] what God had in his mind or what his
[1:15:33] purpose was but it was right there in
[1:15:35] the scripture but it took a prophet to
[1:15:37] tell us what did that scripture really
[1:15:38] mean to the church Christ went to the
[1:15:40] ground but he said also the church had
[1:15:43] to go into the ground why she was the
[1:15:45] seed of Christ manifested in that first
[1:15:48] age now let me go a little further watch
[1:15:50] this the church became the seed and just
[1:15:53] as Jesus had to go on the ground and die
[1:15:55] so did the crop at Pentecost watch what
[1:15:57] Jesus said in St John 16:7 nevertheless
[1:16:00] I tell you the truth it is expedient for
[1:16:03] me that I go away for if I go not away
[1:16:05] the coving will not come unto you but if
[1:16:08] I depart I will send them unto you what
[1:16:10] is he saying I've got to die and go into
[1:16:12] the ground listen that life can come
[1:16:14] forth
[1:16:16] again I've got to die and going into the
[1:16:19] ground that the Holy Ghost that's in me
[1:16:21] can come forth
[1:16:23] again so when the church listen of that
[1:16:27] early age died and went to the ground
[1:16:29] why did it go into the ground brother
[1:16:30] Gordon so life could come forth listen
[1:16:34] again brother Bram said cuz every seed
[1:16:36] has to go on the ground to bring back
[1:16:38] another production of itself so what
[1:16:41] kind of church is God looking for in his
[1:16:43] last days in this season if the seed
[1:16:45] went in the ground in the Dark Ages when
[1:16:48] it came forth he wasn't coming for a
[1:16:49] tassel he wasn't coming for a stalk he
[1:16:51] wasn't coming for pollen what was he
[1:16:53] coming for it's got to come back to the
[1:16:55] original production cuz that's what
[1:16:57] God's looking for you've got to see what
[1:16:59] he's doing by
[1:17:01] nature and if you see that Original Seed
[1:17:03] brother Simmons you know you're looking
[1:17:05] the time is at
[1:17:07] hand do you understand let me go a
[1:17:09] little further he had to die but so did
[1:17:13] this church have to die if she became
[1:17:15] the seed and I don't have time to go
[1:17:17] into it but but Jesus Christ taught in
[1:17:19] Matthew Chapter 13 if you want to go
[1:17:20] back and read it that the church will
[1:17:22] become the seed she's called the seed of
[1:17:24] God or the children of God's Kingdom
[1:17:26] right there in this Parable You and I by
[1:17:28] the word become the
[1:17:30] seed but that church seed had to die now
[1:17:33] watch this and in her appointed season
[1:17:36] she had to die and the theologians
[1:17:39] missed that prophecy but watch what the
[1:17:41] prophet said in the message Masterpiece
[1:17:44] you know I read a book here not long ago
[1:17:47] sometime wrote a book said the silent
[1:17:49] God you might have read it he said I
[1:17:52] forgot where I got it he said he said
[1:17:54] but I I got a copy of it back there on
[1:17:55] my shelf he said the silent God God
[1:17:58] through thousands of Dark Ages listen
[1:18:00] set still and never moved a hand he
[1:18:03] watched faithful mortars go to the
[1:18:05] Lion's pit and burnt and and the burnt
[1:18:07] by the Romans assassinated of all kinds
[1:18:11] women dipped in their clothes listen set
[1:18:12] on fire their long hair and with tar and
[1:18:15] burn remember short hair first began at
[1:18:17] Rome and the women of Christians had
[1:18:19] long hair so they dipped their hair in
[1:18:22] tar and set them on fire and burned them
[1:18:25] and they were and then they stripped
[1:18:26] them naked and fed them to the Lions and
[1:18:28] this writer goes on to say where is that
[1:18:31] God he says oh the blindness of man
[1:18:34] sometimes do you not know that that seed
[1:18:37] had to
[1:18:38] die when the church went through the
[1:18:40] persecutions most people that know
[1:18:42] church history know that millions of
[1:18:44] Christians were mortared but do you
[1:18:46] realize there was a purpose for that
[1:18:49] death there's a time and season for
[1:18:51] everything and a purpose purpose and a
[1:18:53] time for every purpose under Heaven
[1:18:55] There is a time
[1:18:58] to that church had come to its time
[1:19:02] where it had to
[1:19:05] die oh brother holay but that was for
[1:19:07] Jesus a prophet brought out and said
[1:19:09] that was also for the church let me go a
[1:19:12] little
[1:19:14] further he never tried to deliver them
[1:19:16] speaking of God they went down in
[1:19:19] Victory they went down bleeding and
[1:19:21] dying giving their lives why it was a
[1:19:23] seed it had to fall into the ground as 1
[1:19:26] John 12 tells us a corn of wheat if it
[1:19:29] got to fall into the ground and there
[1:19:31] die and not only die but rot but little
[1:19:35] did the denomination know that that life
[1:19:37] was still there though the church itself
[1:19:41] died listen God they couldn't take the
[1:19:44] Holy Ghost life out of the earth they
[1:19:45] killed the bodies of the people just
[1:19:48] like they killed Christ body at Calvary
[1:19:50] but did they kill the life no the life
[1:19:53] was still there and what it do it came
[1:19:55] back at Pentecost and when they killed
[1:19:57] those real Pentecost Believers in the
[1:19:59] Dark Ages did they sto the life no it
[1:20:02] came right back in marttin Luther and
[1:20:04] what did it say it said God still here
[1:20:06] and the just shall live by
[1:20:08] faith nature was showing you can destroy
[1:20:11] the the shell but you could not destroy
[1:20:14] the
[1:20:17] life but what was God showing he was
[1:20:19] showing nature now the plan came forth
[1:20:23] said but what was it he said that little
[1:20:24] stalk that came up by Mont Luther
[1:20:26] screaming a Jud should live by faith he
[1:20:28] said that's not the fullness of what
[1:20:29] Paul preached it was part of his message
[1:20:32] but it wasn't all of his
[1:20:34] message but God couldn't come for a
[1:20:36] bride church until the same seed that
[1:20:38] went the ground no Farmer harvest when
[1:20:41] he sees a stock the farmer can't Harvest
[1:20:44] until he sees the seed
[1:20:47] again so there was no Rapture going to
[1:20:49] happen his age cuz it wasn't the season
[1:20:53] but yet it was the life of God so
[1:20:55] brother don't put him down cuz that was
[1:20:58] true Holy Ghost life it was just in a
[1:21:00] carrier
[1:21:01] stage carriers change seeds never change
[1:21:07] the same seed that goes in the ground is
[1:21:09] the same seed you get at Harvest but the
[1:21:11] plant changes it's just a carrier on the
[1:21:15] way back to the original Crop you see
[1:21:18] what I'm getting
[1:21:20] at then the next thing after Luther was
[1:21:23] Wesley they got brother said oh you had
[1:21:26] Baptist shoots you had Presbyterian
[1:21:28] shoots you had Lutheran shoots he said
[1:21:29] but when Wesley came he said now we're
[1:21:31] back to
[1:21:32] tsel that's what pollen is pollen can
[1:21:35] move where the other plant part of Plant
[1:21:37] can't move pollen can be blown by the
[1:21:39] wind that was the missionary age he said
[1:21:42] but that still wasn't
[1:21:44] seed so then came the Pentecostals now
[1:21:47] listen what happens in the Pentecostal
[1:21:49] age he said now you got well looks like
[1:21:53] seed coming back on the plant he said
[1:21:56] but it wasn't real seed what was it it
[1:21:58] was shook it was something that looked
[1:22:01] almost like seed but it didn't have the
[1:22:03] same life or the same strength that that
[1:22:06] first seed had because it wasn't a seed
[1:22:08] it was only a coding that was to protect
[1:22:10] the seed and where did our messenger
[1:22:13] come from where did he preach many of
[1:22:15] those sermons that you and I listen to
[1:22:16] where did they come from they came out
[1:22:18] of Pentecostal churches out of a
[1:22:20] Pentecostal age where that Prophet was
[1:22:21] saying as a p Pentecostal messenger
[1:22:24] sewing the seed for the last day and
[1:22:26] where was it growing right there in the
[1:22:28] Pentecostal reals but when the fool word
[1:22:31] came
[1:22:32] listen it wasn't just part of the truth
[1:22:36] but when God opened those Seven Seals
[1:22:38] what was he doing he was taking the
[1:22:40] church back to the fullness of the word
[1:22:42] we had a messenger that preached the
[1:22:44] same thing that Paul preached what was
[1:22:46] it doing bringing a bride back to full
[1:22:50] seed and it said what happened when that
[1:22:52] seed opened up the Pentecost was pulled
[1:22:55] away why it was shook are you following
[1:22:58] me it wasn't attached to the seed it was
[1:23:01] just carrier life but it pulled back and
[1:23:04] exposed the seed well brother Holloway
[1:23:06] where does that put us brother BR said
[1:23:08] now with the open word we're back to the
[1:23:10] seed
[1:23:12] age man this what I want to get you to
[1:23:15] when the seed was revealed brother Brown
[1:23:17] said but this is the deal it was
[1:23:20] green did you know that
[1:23:24] it was
[1:23:25] green you don't
[1:23:27] Harvest Green
[1:23:30] Seed it might me do it might rot you
[1:23:35] don't Harvest Green Seed watch what this
[1:23:38] Prophet said bear with me for a minute
[1:23:42] watch what he
[1:23:43] said in Christ revealing his own word
[1:23:46] the thing that do was to matter with
[1:23:48] this message now watch this today is
[1:23:51] those who obtain an in their hearts now
[1:23:53] remember what James said establish your
[1:23:57] what Hearts those that obtained in their
[1:24:00] hearts must lay in the presence of the
[1:24:03] son to get
[1:24:05] ripened you see we're not in seeds to an
[1:24:08] age anymore are you following me we're
[1:24:10] in ripening
[1:24:13] stage not a time to be am I sure I'm in
[1:24:16] the church am I sure I'm saved am I sure
[1:24:18] I believe his message am I sure brother
[1:24:20] Sim is my pastor yes see we got to move
[1:24:23] past being shaken tossed to and fro
[1:24:25] we're at a stage now where God is
[1:24:27] getting the real Believers ready by
[1:24:29] ripening
[1:24:31] them you know I watched a little video
[1:24:33] because I want to understand by Nature I
[1:24:34] said I know I'm teaching nature I said I
[1:24:35] know what the prophet said I read a
[1:24:37] little bit I want to see some more about
[1:24:38] real wheat razors real wheat Farmers so
[1:24:41] I went and watch one video on wheat
[1:24:42] farming just to get a little bit more
[1:24:44] understanding about wheat he said in
[1:24:46] weed farm and he said when it's in this
[1:24:47] green stage he said it looks like seed
[1:24:50] it's not the Chuck no more it's actually
[1:24:52] real seed he said but if you pluck that
[1:24:54] seed off the plant and squeeze it
[1:24:56] brother Simmons you know what you get
[1:24:58] you get a little milk come out it's a
[1:25:00] little milk come out you can't do
[1:25:02] nothing with a seed full of milk he said
[1:25:05] but if you let it stay in the field a
[1:25:06] little bit longer you see that Prophet
[1:25:09] brought back the seed but why didn't the
[1:25:11] Rapture come God had to leave you and I
[1:25:13] here a little bit longer why the seed
[1:25:15] had to
[1:25:18] ripen yes we got the word the seed is
[1:25:21] here but the seed has got to
[1:25:25] ripen he said leave it to feel a little
[1:25:27] bit longer he said what is it doing he
[1:25:29] said the more the sun bakes on it the
[1:25:31] more the sun bakes on it he said that
[1:25:33] little milk on inside begins to firm up
[1:25:36] and get harder and get more dense and
[1:25:38] get harder and what does it do it gets
[1:25:40] heavier and when it does that what
[1:25:42] happens that weed begins to bow it
[1:25:43] begins to bow it be what brother Brown
[1:25:45] said what does it doing is humbling
[1:25:47] itself before the sun that's calling
[1:25:51] it and and it's changing from Green it's
[1:25:54] literally changing on the outside
[1:25:55] Brother s you can see the change on the
[1:25:57] inside manifested on the
[1:25:59] outside this bride's got to have such a
[1:26:02] life such a character such a personality
[1:26:04] of Christ she ain't just changed out
[1:26:06] here but you can see it on the
[1:26:08] outside she's more
[1:26:11] humble and she ain't green no more she's
[1:26:14] turning golden
[1:26:18] brown do you understand you can identify
[1:26:21] her now now her character is showing it
[1:26:25] why she's laying in the presence of the
[1:26:28] son and is calling her
[1:26:32] home she knows what season she's
[1:26:35] in the heavier she
[1:26:37] gets the more dense that that seed on
[1:26:40] the inside grows gets harder and harder
[1:26:41] not hard against the world but it's
[1:26:44] getting solid on what it believes his
[1:26:46] faith is becoming anchored it's becoming
[1:26:48] a real Rock a real Revelation to her
[1:26:54] do you understand what I'm getting at
[1:26:55] you've got to look in nature to know
[1:26:58] your
[1:26:59] season and when you can see your season
[1:27:03] you know what's happening
[1:27:06] next when is it coming I don't know we
[1:27:08] don't know day or the
[1:27:10] hour the prophet said you might not know
[1:27:12] the day the hour but there's no reason
[1:27:14] why you can't know the
[1:27:18] season I can't tell you what day my
[1:27:22] tomato is going to be
[1:27:23] picked but I can tell you when the
[1:27:25] season's
[1:27:27] coming you take a
[1:27:29] woman that's pregnant I can't tell you
[1:27:33] what day she going have a baby well the
[1:27:34] doctor said November 22nd that's what
[1:27:36] the doctor said how many times the
[1:27:37] doctor's wrong about her pregnancy
[1:27:39] November 22nd I can't tell you what day
[1:27:42] she going to be
[1:27:43] born but when she start wobbling a
[1:27:45] little bit
[1:27:46] more she start breathing a little bit
[1:27:48] harder she
[1:27:50] oh oh
[1:27:52] something's changing I can't tell you
[1:27:55] today but I know brother Samons we
[1:27:56] entered into something the outside is
[1:27:59] testifying what she's entered into what
[1:28:01] is it birth pains are starting and when
[1:28:04] those birth pains are starting what is
[1:28:05] it doing it's testifying we might not
[1:28:07] know the hour but we know the day and
[1:28:08] the season that we're not living in what
[1:28:10] because her body's changing this bride
[1:28:12] is
[1:28:13] changing and if you can't recognize it
[1:28:15] now we're in a certain season now we're
[1:28:18] in a Time inside of that season it's
[1:28:21] time for this bride to go home let me go
[1:28:25] a little bit
[1:28:26] further brother Bram said those who
[1:28:29] obtain it in their hearts must lay in
[1:28:30] the presence of the sun to get ripened
[1:28:34] see you pick up the message and then let
[1:28:37] the son listen now bake all of the
[1:28:39] greenness out of you making you mature
[1:28:42] Christians do you see what I mean God is
[1:28:45] coming soon to receive his church and we
[1:28:48] must have that type of Christian for him
[1:28:51] to receive wheat has got to get ripe all
[1:28:54] right he wasn't coming for Green Seed he
[1:28:58] was coming for mature ripe seed The
[1:29:01] Prophet's going off the scene after he
[1:29:03] has swn the Green Seed but the seed is
[1:29:06] no not green anymore it's becoming flesh
[1:29:10] and that seed flesh bride has got to be
[1:29:13] a ripened seed let me go a little
[1:29:16] further I'll let you go how many
[1:29:18] understand I'm getting
[1:29:20] that we're in a
[1:29:23] season it's not seed sewing
[1:29:26] season it's not stock season it's not
[1:29:29] tassel season it's not shuck season and
[1:29:33] I want to make it real plain it's not
[1:29:35] Green Seed
[1:29:38] season so much we got the word we got
[1:29:41] the word we got the word the word is a
[1:29:44] seed but has that word matured in you
[1:29:48] listen has it become real to you has you
[1:29:52] and that word become one and the same
[1:29:55] that's mature
[1:29:58] seed that's what brother Holloway is
[1:30:01] hungering for Lord I want you to bake so
[1:30:03] much of the greenness out of me till
[1:30:05] there's nothing left but
[1:30:08] Christ brother bramman let the light
[1:30:11] turn on 1964 turn on the light it's
[1:30:15] coming Harvest is ripen the grain shall
[1:30:18] mature with the light but the thing of
[1:30:21] it is today the church grain don't want
[1:30:23] to mature it wants to stay like it was
[1:30:26] back in Moody's times sankis fny Knox
[1:30:29] Calvin they were all right they were the
[1:30:32] light of the hour but this is another
[1:30:34] hour it's another day it's the
[1:30:37] advancement of the Gospel is coming to
[1:30:40] maturity our age and our season now that
[1:30:43] we have the seed
[1:30:45] restored is the coming of maturity
[1:30:49] listen so we can't live in what Luther
[1:30:52] said Wesley said or some other the rest
[1:30:53] of them said we're living in a light
[1:30:56] that's predicted for this day what the
[1:30:58] word said about this season we're in the
[1:31:00] seventh Church age not the third fourth
[1:31:02] Church Age The Grain should be able to
[1:31:05] receive it if it doesn't it falls off
[1:31:08] and it means nothing to it but the grain
[1:31:11] is matured with the light if it goes
[1:31:14] ahead with the light we have to stay
[1:31:18] under the light of this age in order for
[1:31:21] the grain to be ripened by the light of
[1:31:24] this age I'm going to say this in
[1:31:27] closing and I told the pastor I really
[1:31:29] appreciate on his his teaching when I
[1:31:31] came in I kind of wish I felt like I
[1:31:33] needed to get back there and get quiet
[1:31:35] before I came out here this morning but
[1:31:36] I sure would have liked to sit out here
[1:31:37] and listen on what he was teaching he
[1:31:39] said he was working on Danel 70 weeks I
[1:31:41] said I'll be honest I ain't never taught
[1:31:42] on Danel 70 weeks I've studied it but I
[1:31:44] ain't never taught on it but I like
[1:31:45] hearing it t because it's part of the
[1:31:47] light of this age that we need to know
[1:31:48] to recognize where we
[1:31:50] at but I planted some Garden this past
[1:31:54] year and again I'm learning from nature
[1:31:57] I'm not a farmer naturally
[1:31:59] speaking but I want to be a better
[1:32:01] farmer because I like eating
[1:32:03] healthy I'm getting a little older
[1:32:06] now and I find that certain foods my
[1:32:08] body can do better with so I'm trying to
[1:32:11] eat healthier and I'm trying to grow my
[1:32:13] own
[1:32:14] crop and so when I planted certain
[1:32:16] produce or actually I didn't plant it we
[1:32:18] bought certain produce from the
[1:32:20] store wife and I realize the best
[1:32:22] fertilizer you can put on your garden is
[1:32:24] compost I didn't have much compost this
[1:32:27] past year so I said next year I'm I'm
[1:32:28] going plant me about five or six big
[1:32:30] compost piles and when I start my
[1:32:31] farming next spring I'm going have
[1:32:32] plenty of compost to mature that
[1:32:35] crop and so the way we make compost is
[1:32:37] we take food scraps not no meats and
[1:32:39] nothing like that just vegetables off
[1:32:41] the table and vegetables you got left
[1:32:42] over rice grains anything like that just
[1:32:45] throw it in the pile with some leaves
[1:32:46] and man that makes some of the best
[1:32:48] compost that's the best fertilizer you
[1:32:50] can come up with so as I'm putting my
[1:32:52] food scraps in this compost pile but the
[1:32:55] Simons I come out there one day in order
[1:32:56] to make compost you got to turn it you
[1:32:58] just going to throw it out there and
[1:32:58] walk away you got to work it you got to
[1:33:00] work it you follow me I came out one day
[1:33:03] to work my compost pile and I looked and
[1:33:05] I had three or four plants growing in my
[1:33:06] compost pile I said I ain't planting
[1:33:08] nothing in that compost what in the
[1:33:09] world is this I watched it and I could
[1:33:11] tell about a leaf I said it looks like a
[1:33:13] zucchini or squash or
[1:33:16] something so I took it out the compost I
[1:33:19] had to turn it and I put it in a flower
[1:33:21] pot
[1:33:22] I said I'm going to watch it just to see
[1:33:23] what happens with it and it began to
[1:33:25] grow and it begin to grow the vine got B
[1:33:27] by as far as me that that almost as far
[1:33:29] as me to that Pew right there and began
[1:33:32] to put the prettiest
[1:33:33] flowers and all of a sudden those
[1:33:35] flowers began to turn into produce and I
[1:33:37] saw something coming there about the
[1:33:38] size of my thumb I said honey I think we
[1:33:40] got
[1:33:42] zucchini I said but one problem brother
[1:33:44] Simmons it came out of
[1:33:46] season listen now in order for it to
[1:33:50] produce it came out of
[1:33:53] season if it had only came at the right
[1:33:56] time I could have had
[1:33:58] zucchini but just when it really began
[1:34:01] to take form and make zucchini guess
[1:34:04] what happened the frost
[1:34:07] came you see it tried to come forth at
[1:34:09] the wrong time if it had come forth
[1:34:12] about two months earlier it would have
[1:34:14] produced the mature
[1:34:16] crop but it missed its
[1:34:20] season yet it was the right
[1:34:24] seed do you
[1:34:27] understand we don't want to miss our
[1:34:30] season let's be sincere as James said
[1:34:34] turn our hearts towards God say Lord
[1:34:38] mature this
[1:34:40] seed whatever I'm lacking bake that out
[1:34:43] now while the sunlight still
[1:34:45] shining but there coming a day real soon
[1:34:49] people are going to want this light and
[1:34:51] it's not going to be here and the bride
[1:34:55] that followed the word and sat under
[1:34:57] that light she have come to mature seed
[1:35:01] ripen seed and the husband man has taken
[1:35:04] her from the
[1:35:05] earth let's just lay in the presence of
[1:35:07] the son and be real sincere about it and
[1:35:12] say God reveal yourself to me let me see
[1:35:15] who I am let me see this word of this
[1:35:18] age and let me see my place in it cuz
[1:35:21] this is my season and I don't want to
[1:35:23] miss it musicians come let's bow our
[1:35:26] heads let's bow our
[1:35:30] heads dear heavenly
[1:35:33] father I want to thank you for your
[1:35:39] grace thank you for giving us eyes to
[1:35:43] see giving us ears to
[1:35:46] hear to recognize this the hand of God
[1:35:50] moving upon the Earth and in this age as
[1:35:53] you have in every age there's not been
[1:35:56] an age Lord where you have had not your
[1:35:58] work being done in the earth men might
[1:36:01] not see it they might not recognize it
[1:36:04] but that doesn't mean you're not here
[1:36:07] working so many look back and say God
[1:36:09] sent a prophet and I believe that Lord
[1:36:11] or I wouldn't have quoted him
[1:36:13] today many look ahead and said there
[1:36:15] coming of rapture that's coming to
[1:36:17] Millennium I believe that and Lord I'm
[1:36:19] looking for it also
[1:36:21] but God I know that there's something
[1:36:23] happening right now the holy spirit is
[1:36:25] moving right
