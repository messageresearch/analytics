[39:46] possession
[39:48] your position amen
[39:50] praise god the opening of the word
[39:52] praise god amen brought you over amen
[39:55] into your possession now the placing of
[39:58] sons is your adoption amen
[40:01] so by the grace of god i hope you
[40:03] understand
[40:04] that amen as
[40:06] joshua was the book of joshua was to the
[40:09] children of israel so the book of
[40:11] ephesians is to you and i
[40:14] are you with me
[40:15] joshua talked about a jordan river and
[40:18] crossing over into the promised land
[40:21] are you with me
[40:23] we're talking about
[40:24] amen not only are crossing over into the
[40:27] promised land what we're talking about
[40:30] positionally place in your promise
[40:33] you know it's not enough to taste
[40:36] of the fruits of the land because amen
[40:38] when he sent the spies out they came
[40:40] back and they they bought back the
[40:42] fruits
[40:43] amen but they said there wasn't evil
[40:46] they meant to possess it the land
[40:49] praise god but joshua and caleb had
[40:51] another spirit and they said we're more
[40:52] than able
[40:54] are you with me
[40:55] and i believe that we have some joshuas
[40:58] and caleb's in here this morning
[41:00] and then and those that are listening in
[41:02] we have some joshua and caleb that said
[41:04] we well able
[41:06] praise god i don't look at the
[41:08] circumstances of the condition i'm
[41:10] talking about your conviction amen
[41:12] greater is he that's in you
[41:15] amen the glory that shall be revealed
[41:17] we're not looking at emit the sufferings
[41:20] and the things that we go through in
[41:21] this world amen praise god hallelujah
[41:27] but
[41:28] the manifestation or the manifested sons
[41:31] of god
[41:33] amen
[41:35] let me let me just
[41:37] look again at this 18th verse in romans
[41:40] it says
[41:43] i reckon
[41:45] that the sufferings of this present time
[41:47] are not what
[41:49] they're not what
[41:52] come on i mean the devil could tell you
[41:54] about what's going on what you've been
[41:56] through what you're going through and i
[41:58] want to let you know
[42:00] all that the devil is all the lies of
[42:03] the devil amen it won't hinder you
[42:06] and it won't happen to me
[42:09] all that the devil is
[42:11] all the afflictions all the troubles and
[42:14] all the problems and all the conditions
[42:17] you know some folks are not able to face
[42:20] the enemy
[42:21] they're not able to stand up amen before
[42:24] the adversary and amen with all kind of
[42:27] problems and all kind of acquisitions
[42:30] all kind of accusing the brethren amen
[42:33] some people when they look at the
[42:35] accusation and accuse and and all of
[42:38] that they said we can't take the land
[42:40] praise god we can't we can't cross over
[42:44] brother brother and sister that was a
[42:46] they met uh uh joshua and caleb in the
[42:48] bunch amen praise god that was he meant
[42:52] the holy ghost joshua and that was he
[42:55] meant a believer caleb amen that's
[42:58] saying we can't take it
[43:00] amen let us cross over this jordan and
[43:03] brother sister jordan is a
[43:05] representation of death amen in the
[43:08] promised land amen praise god is the
[43:10] type of the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:13] amen and god has promised joshua and
[43:16] caleb the true believer amen are
[43:18] crossing over jordan amen and the
[43:21] crossing over jordan and saying to you
[43:23] and i that we pass from death to life
[43:27] are you with me
[43:29] so you're crossing over amen as a
[43:31] believer amen that you pass from death
[43:35] to life
[43:36] amen praise god this is what god
[43:38] promised you amen across and over amen
[43:42] and the book of joshua speaks of a cross
[43:46] in jordan amen into your promised land a
[43:49] natural land but the book of faith
[43:52] ephesians talks about a crossing over
[43:55] coming out of the world and dying to the
[43:58] things of the flesh and crossing over
[44:00] into the promise of the baptism of the
[44:02] holy ghost into a spiritual land
[44:06] are you with me
[44:08] are y'all following me
[44:10] amen so you're crossing over
[44:13] he said so we know the suffering of this
[44:16] present time we're not compared to be uh
[44:19] uh not worried to be compared with the
[44:21] glory which shall it talks about future
[44:24] which shall be revealed it must be a
[44:27] time when we were talking about future
[44:29] tense we'll talk about present tense
[44:32] amen so when they were talking 2 000
[44:35] years ago and paul writing this he said
[44:37] it shall that means it was a promise to
[44:40] you and i it meant that there shall be a
[44:43] people that would not say shall amen but
[44:45] a people that would manifest what shall
[44:48] be
[44:49] they meant things that ought to be amen
[44:52] they are right now
[44:54] praise god so god has brought you over
[44:58] into your inheritance
[45:00] praise god
[45:03] he says shall be revealed in us
[45:06] it's something about the opening of the
[45:08] word and opening up the seals and the
[45:10] opening of the book amen it actually
[45:13] showed you your inheritance showed you
[45:15] your position it brought you into your
[45:18] placing
[45:20] are you with me
[45:22] once you can recognize your position
[45:25] amen
[45:26] so
[45:27] the revealing
[45:30] revealed in us now amen
[45:33] he said for the earnest 19th verse for
[45:36] the earnest expectation
[45:38] see amen
[45:40] it has to be an earnest desire
[45:43] amen that

[53:26] expectation
[53:28] without any experience you're not
[53:29] looking for anything or expecting
[53:31] nothing that's why people live all kind
[53:33] of ways
[53:35] they don't have nothing to live for
[53:38] they do any kind of crazy i mean
[53:40] anything they ain't got nothing to live

[1:01:25] not only is it with me he's in me
[1:01:28] amen and i come in the last day as the
[1:01:31] invincible army of god
[1:01:33] praise god showing forth that we are
[1:01:36] victorious
[1:01:37] in christ
[1:01:39] praise god by faith i claim it
[1:01:42] by faith i i manifest that which is
[1:01:46] written of me
[1:01:50] oh lord
[1:01:53] but some just
[1:01:55] keep waiting
[1:01:57] i believe there'll be many that just
[1:01:59] they meant looking for
[1:02:01] that to take place when it already took
[1:02:04] place
[1:02:05] they'll be sitting around still waiting
[1:02:07] on him
[1:02:08] he said the rapture passed right through
[1:02:10] you
[1:02:12] he said
[1:02:14] and they're saying i thought the rapture
[1:02:16] would take place
[1:02:18] before the great tribulation come
[1:02:22] those two prophets appeared over there
[1:02:24] moses and elijah and israel
[1:02:26] and they are
[1:02:27] at the feast of atonement
[1:02:30] and you said
[1:02:32] i thought the two prophets of revelation
[1:02:34] 11
[1:02:35] i thought
[1:02:36] the rapture would take place before that
[1:02:40] not knowing that you missed the rapture
[1:02:43] failing to understand what god was doing
[1:02:47] this present tense hour
[1:02:49] brother and sister i'm telling you
[1:02:50] brother and sister it's something that
[1:02:52] needs
[1:02:53] we need to wake up
[1:02:55] we need to wake up
[1:02:57] and recognize that everything that we
[1:02:59] need is here
[1:03:00] now but god is doing the work right now
[1:03:04] in the midst of us
[1:03:05] but if we don't recognize it it's not
[1:03:07] going to do us any good
[1:03:10] just reading about it talking about the
[1:03:12] intellectual knowledge won't give it to
[1:03:14] us
[1:03:15] it's got to come by revelation
[1:03:18] christ revealing himself to us by
[1:03:20] revelation
[1:03:21] are you with me
[1:03:23] but to say we believe and not be able to
[1:03:26] manifest what we believe amen if we say
[1:03:29] it and cannot do live it then we'll not
[1:03:32] praise god
[1:03:33] we don't believe it
[1:03:35] but when we truly believe it then it
[1:03:37] comes amen a manifestation a duel of the
[1:03:40] word not just a hear but a duel
[1:03:44] praise god you are obligated by god to
[1:03:49] call god
