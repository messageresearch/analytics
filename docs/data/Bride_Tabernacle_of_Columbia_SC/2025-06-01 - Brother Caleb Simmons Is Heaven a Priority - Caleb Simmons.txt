Let us all [Music] [Laughter] bow. Lord Jesus, we thank you for letting us be in your house one more time this morning. Lord, a songwriter wrote, "Lord, it's me. is me, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer. And Lord, we need your help this morning. Lord, we need your guidance, your direction. And Lord, we need your Holy Ghost to come down and take complete control. Lord, move us all the way out of the way. Lord, meet all the needs, all the heart's desires, those that are spoken, those that are unspoken. Lord, touch the families that are in bereavement at this time. Touch all the prayer requests, Lord Jesus. Oh, we ask that you continue to move and touch every need in this service this morning. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles this morning, we're going to turn to the book of Philippians, chapter 3. Philippians chapter 3. And when you got it, say amen. Amen. And it reads, "Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord to write the same thing to you. To me indeed is not grievious, but for you it is it is a safe. It is safe. Beware of dogs. Beware of evil workers. Beware of concision. For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. Though I might also have confidence in the flesh, if any man thinkketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law, a Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the righteous, which is which is in the law blameless. But what things were gained of me? Those I counted lost for Christ. Amen. Yay. Doubtless. And I count all things but lost for the excellence excellency of the knowledge suffered of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For whom I have suffered the loss of all things and to count them but dung that I may win Christ. Amen. But I but be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith, that I may know him the power of and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his suffering, being made conformable unto his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead, Not as though I have already obtained either were already perfect, but I follow after if that I might apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myselves to have apprehended, but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Amen. God bless word. You may be seated. Amen. And I like to speak on a little topic that I entitled, is heaven a priority? Is heaven a priority? And I started to think about this. I had a couple different things that initially I was going to entitled is heaven your goal? But I realized sometimes in life, you can have goals that aren't priorities. Amen. You can have you can have a goal that you set. This is a goal I want to achieve, but it's a far off. So right now it's not a priority. So I wanted to bring it closer and said is heaven a priority because sometimes when you organizing your goals you put them in what's the nearest thing possible that I can achieve or what do I want to achieve right now. That's right. So when you go to achie you you you set these goals up you have to prioritize your goals. Amen. You have to set them in order and say no this is what's my priority number one right now. My priority number two right now and it doesn't matter what it is in life, we always are looking at achieving something. No matter where you go and what you do, you always are trying to achieve something. If it's working on a job, you always trying to see, okay, how can I get more money? That that's some people's goal. That's all they don't want to switch jobs. They just want more money. Some people, it's about status. So, they're trying to achieve another level. They're trying to become a manager, a supervisor, or something else cuz that's their goal. And so they'll say within two years, especially in this day and age, they said within two years, you don't move up, you switch jobs. That's the new mentality. There's no more you work a job for 40 years and the company going to take care of you. So when you start to thinking about it, it's not about what are your goals, but what is your priority? Amen. Amen. And and what are you prioritizing in this time? And is even having a priority on your list? Some people got long list of priorities, but God is way way way down on the list. Even if he even shows up on the list, Jesus cuz you said all these things. This what I can achieve here and I can achieve this and I'll do this and I'll do this and somewhere on the list, God ain't even on it. There's no, hey, I want to grow closer to God. Hey, I want to do this to grow closer to God. There's no strategic thinking about how can I get closer to God. There's a list of priorities of how I can do better at work, how I can do better at school, how I can do better at doing this, how can I get a car that I want, how can I and you're setting aside all these things. Not only that, you're planning for it. You're planning for it. Hey, if I got to if I want to buy a car in the next year, I want to save up this much money now. I want to put this much in an account. I want to have my ducks in a row. But we don't do God the same way. We don't look at God and say, "Hey, I'm looking that." Cuz sometimes we come to God and think that everything's supposed to be instantaneous. When we come to God, we don't think that hey, that Lord, I was supposed to be preparing for what you were going to send me. That's right. It's just that God was going to send it to me and then we initially and then we call it a blessing. Cuz when God does what we ask him to, then we say, "Oh, it was a great blessing." But we didn't realize that, hey, hey, it took some it took some work to get it. Like he said, faith without works is dead. So, you had to prepare for it. Even though you didn't realize it, there was some times that you was praying for it that while you was asking, you was in the midst of praying for it. You was seeking after it. You had a sole focus on what you wanted God to do. Amen. And when you got that soul focused, God realized how serious you were. God realized, hey, they got a priority. They want me to do this. And while they want me to do this, they praying for it. They asking for it. They seeking me for it. They reading scriptures about it, having more faith, and increasing everything. When you want God to do something for you, and it's a what you call a blessing. You you see people sending you scriptures on faith. You ain't even got to go look for them no more. and see it's encouraging you. But the same way that we look at God and say, "Lord, I need you to move in this situation." Are we looking at it and saying, "I got this much focus on going to heaven." Amen. I got that much focus on going to heaven. I'm aligning everything in my life so that Lord, when you come, I'm going back with you. Amen. Amen. Amen. But are is it a priority for us even on our on our things? And I know it's easy to to get caught up in life because you get caught up on doing this and doing that and doing this and doing that. It's not that you forget God is that you always you seeing God move in your life, but you're not setting it as something that's in the forefront of my life. Everything you know happens by the way of God and you know God does everything. He works it all to the good. But are you setting it down as a priority of setting your relationship with God as something that you truly focus on? Amen. Like you know God is moving and you see him doing all the works, but are you focused on having that relationship with him? Are you doing the small things every day that can have a continual communion with God that each and every day that you can speak to him, talk to him and he talks back to you? See, we we see the God do the big things, but what about in the small things? Said said, I think about Elijah when when the spirit of God and he was there and they sent him. It was in the fire. It was in the wind and it was and through the storm and these different things, but it wasn't until he heard that small still voice. He said that that that I know that's God right there. That's small. See, he was able to recognize the voice of God because he knew what it sounded like. He wasn't looking for the big thing. He wasn't looking for the grand thing. Even though he knew God was doing those things, he saw it and he knew that these are only acts of God. But but he he got down and he recognized the voice of God that was speaking to him because he had that personal relationship with God that Lord, I know your voice. As he said, my sheep, they know my voice. So, so when when you know God and God knows you, you recognize when he's speaking to you. You recognize when he he's trying to make you turn left when you want to go right and he's trying to make you go right when you want to go left and and and you're more susceptible to listening when you have that relationship. You ever had someone walk up to you and tell you to do something and you didn't know them? Yeah. So that you didn't know them and and and you and and they might have looked like they was um they was a little out of it. Now some people they get to when they meet somebody random like that, they go ahead and dismiss the message because of how the person looked or how they seem to be acting in that moment. Now, no matter whether that message was true or not, you you didn't think about the message. You just discounted it because of where it came from. But you ever had someone close to you tell you it's the same thing. Sometimes it can have a different weight. It can have a different effect. And the same thing is with God. It's different when you hear from God every blue moon versus when you talk to him every day. Amen. It's different. Those relationships are different. But you see, God has a way of working out of the stranger as he does out of the person that's close to you. He has a working of working every day. And sometimes he does the great things for you. He allows you to see that. Hey, listen. If you put me first, all these things will be added to you. Whether it's big or small, all these things will be added to you. And so he allows you to see that, hey, if you put this as a priority, all the things that you're trying to reach and achieve will come along with the package. Amen. It's a package service that you didn't realize all these things was included in the package. Amen. But also in the package was trials and tribulations. Amen. Amen. But you have that that comes along with the package. But after every trial and after every tribulation, there's a reward. Amen. See, the devil just take you through trials and tribulations and that's it. There ain't no reward to it. But when God takes you through, it's something to build up your character. It's something to make you a better person, to make you stronger in him, to allow you to grow, for you to see that, hey, all things do work together to the good. Amen. I don't have to understand it to believe that God is doing it. Amen. and say when you put go put it as a priority, you you start to realize uh how how how different your relationship with God can be. Yes. How different your relationship with God can be and and realizing that that he said in John 14:6 say he said I am the way, the truth and the life. No man cometh under the father but by me. See see these are things that I thought about it. And I said, "Sometimes you got to take it as like running a race." And when you're running the race, sometimes when you running a long long long distance race, not a short race, a long distance race, a marathon, a triathlon, one of those. Many of times, they'll provide things on the side for you. If you running a long distance, I think of triathlon. This guy, he he had packed snacks along the way to run this race. He he there were stops along the way for you to grab water and grab these things because you needed the energy to keep going. That's right. You needed the energy to keep going. And I said, when when you set things as a priority, it's not that everything else doesn't matter. It's that you have a renewed focus on what's important. Amen. And and during the race, sometimes you have to get these energy boosts to have a renewed focus on what's what's important, what matters, and what actually am I doing while I'm running this race? Am I just running aimlessly in circles? Or do I have a goal? Is there something that I'm trying to strive for? Is there something that I'm trying to achieve here while I'm running this race? Yeah. Many of times some people they on the endless tread on the treadmill and they just running. They don't even know why they running and they wonder why they struggling with what they going through because they just running and they have no goal in mind. Hey, I want to hit a mile in this much time or hey, I want to I want to run this run this 5K or something like that. When you have a goal in mind, it's easier to work towards that goal. Cuz today I might not hit that 3.1 miles, but even if I hit a half a mile running it straight, hey, I I've done something towards my goal. Amen. And it's the same way with God each and every day. Like you don't have to expect, oh my God, I'm going to have visions tomorrow. Now if God gives it to you, hey there, that's different. But you know sometimes and that might not be even the gift that God want to give you. But there's something that he has for each and every last one of us. There's something that he wants each and every last one of us to do. And sometimes he's waiting for you to elevate to a level that he can put you in position for you to do it. He's waiting for you to get in position for you to say, "Lord, Lord, I have surrendered it all and I truly have given you everything. Lord, I put everything to the side. I've done like Paul. I set aside everything and I've counted all that I've gained to be lost." Amen. Amen. And I realized that Lord, the only thing that matters is me is me going to heaven. I realize the only thing that matters is me making this a priority in my life. Is me setting aside everything else and say even though if I achieve these things, that's great, but it's not the most important thing. Even if I do these things and they might not be wrong, it just might be a part of the journey, but it's not the ultimate end of my journey. It's not where I want to end up. It's just a stop on where I'm going. Amen. See, some people they get to points and this is all that they wanted to achieve and that's it. And they get there and they say, you know what, I'm good. I'm satisfied. But I I said don't get satis. That's why I asked where is heaven on your priority list? I is it somewhere deep down the list? I want to achieve all these things before I start prioritizing going to heaven. or is it something that you know it's towards the top but it ain't on the top. See sometimes it can be towards the top but not on the top and realizing that the things of God are so important that they should be in this day and time it should be right there as a number one priority. Amen. It should be there's so many things and so many signs of the time if you read and you study you realize that hey we might not have that much more time to be here. Amen. Amen. Amen. And even if we do, that doesn't mean it's any less important. Amen. Even if we got another 50 to 100 years, which we don't know, but it could be. I mean, 50 or 100 years ago, they wasn't saying that we would last to this time. So, I mean, so we don't know that God only knows the timing that we have. But even if it's not, if it's if it's if it is to be, that doesn't make heaven less of a priority. That doesn't mean that God ain't coming back tomorrow. That doesn't mean that he can't take us out of here cuz everybody has a time and a season. So you never know that. Yeah, this could be your last moment. Might not be anybody, but it could be your last moment. And where is heaven on your priority list? See, it's an individual thing that you got to ask yourself. Amen. Amen. That you got to come to and and and I wrote something down. I said, "How are you prep uh like how are you preparing to get there? How are you preparing to achieve this priority? How what steps have you laid out that you put in the row and say this is what I'm going to do to work to work on my relationship with God? This is what I'm going to do to get stronger in the Lord. This is what I'm going to do to focus on me becoming closer to God." Amen. Amen. Have you asked those questions to yourself? Amen. Cuz those are something that each and every last one of us have to ask ourselves. Amen. Now, the prophet of God said, "You want to grow closer to God, he said, read your Bible and pray every day." And I think if you start, that's where you can start. But once you start there, you you you start to build up a habit and and it'll get so good to you. You'll start to read deeper and you'll start to trying to understand things and asking God for wisdom and understanding to break down his word to you. Amen. It doesn't always take the preacher. It's something that you got to do yourself. And that God allowed the men of God and to place them there that they can break it down in ways that you can understand it. That's why you come to them and ask them questions and and God placed them there that they may have wisdom and understanding to break it down so you can get a deeper knowledge and a deeper understanding of it. Amen. Amen. Yes. So, so and and I started I started thinking about it and understanding that hey, listen, it takes you it takes you examining your own self cuz I can't tell you what's on your priority list. I can't tell you the goals that you want to achieve, but I promise you, if you put this if you put this as the number one priority, all the other ones will work out. Amen. Amen. All the other ones will fall into place. Cuz I guarantee you, you got goals on there that you don't even know how they going to uh work out. You don't even know if they're the right goals that I should be striving for. Cuz sometimes you'll write something down. If you ever look back over your life, you might have had a goal. And once you live long enough, you can look back and about five or 10 years ago, 15 years ago, for some people longer. And they might have said by this time I want to achieve this. And if you look back, you realize the pathway of you achieving if you achieved it. That's if it the pathway that you might have that God took you on to allow you to achieve what you said you wanted to achieve by this was totally different than how you thought or how you imagine I was stacking all this stuff up to achieve it. And so when when when God has a way of taking you through this that and the other to lead you to where he wants you to be. Amen. And he has, excuse me, he has a way of allowing us that when he takes us through, it prepares us for what for for for for what's coming and what may come down the line. But it's all in what where where have you put your priorities. Where have you set your pathway for? And what are you trying what are you trying to achieve? Many people don't think about what am I trying to achieve. That's right. They just go do a thing. Amen. And then they look at and then then they're always in a reaction mode because they did this thing that it had a consequence and they did this thing and it had a consequence. They never think before they go do the thing, why am I doing this? Amen. Amen. And I think sometimes we don't think about it because we don't want to think about it. We don't want to consider the consequences of what might happen and like if we go and do this thing bless we don't want to think about it cuz you know that's too much negativity you know that just put me in a bad space you know be and that's the way we get but sometimes that can be a trap of the enemy that can be something the devil allows us to use and he's and then you notice it becomes a habit to you just start doing stuff. Amen. And then you say, "I deal with it later. I deal with it later." Well, when is later going to come cuz you you done st stockpile so much up eventually you you in front of later and it's there and now and now you got to deal with a whole lot of stuff that you could have dealt with individually here there and it wouldn't seem so overwhelming when you got there. But you see you you didn't set out, hey, why am I doing this? What is my priority? And why why am I what am I trying to achieve when I do this? Amen. What am I trying to gain? What will I gain if I do this? Cuz some things when you look at it, you'll be like, "This is a net zero. I'm doing this thing and it's a it's causing me to do this and cause me to do that and I end up in the loss." And after enough of those, you got to say, "Hey, why in the world am I doing this? I'm making this." Like they said, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over and expecting a different result. But sometimes we get to we'll say that we did it differently cuz we think that it was a it's a different version of the same issue. But we never sat down to think about it and be like, you know, that's the same issue. Just a different version. You know, that's the same issue. Just a different personalities in the issue. That's right. You know, that's the same issue. The same issue I had with mama is the same issue I had my boss. It's the same one I had with this person in the thought. Oh, I didn't realize I had issue with listening to people. Lord, Jesus, cuz I I never sat down and cuz I never wanted to sit down and think about it. Amen. But if you thought about it and prayed about it, maybe somebody you hear somebody say, "Hey, you need to you need to do something about this." Somebody that cared about you and say, "Hey, son, you need to work on your anger. Mhm. Mhm. Uh-huh. And when you And when you think about it, sometimes it's a hard thing to sit down and say, you know what, this is something I need to take to God. Amen. This is something that I don't think might not be an issue, but you know, you can't see yourself better than somebody sitting outside of you. And sometimes God is trying to work on you and mold you for the next stages and phases of your life. Amen. And God is trying to tell you, "Hey, there's a little bit more chiseling I need to do on you. There's a little bit more work I need to do on you. There's a little bit more I need to knock out of you." Amen. Like, you come this far and you done. You done all right. Yeah, you got some priorities, right? But some things you need to rearrange. Some things you need to redesign. Some things you need to figure out how to maneuver and change differently. Like, yeah, you got some things in order, but you need to work on it and put some more focus on this area. put some more eyes on this thing and hey, become more self-aware of what's going on. See, but God allows us sometimes he uses others to point out things in you and sometimes that's the most time that you get the most defensive. Because you see yourself differently than others see you. That's right. But that doesn't mean that what they're seeing isn't true. That's right. Amen. That doesn't mean that what they're seeing isn't something that you don't you don't need to work on. That doesn't mean that hey, they can see some they can see some of your list by how you react. They can see what you prioritizing by the actions that you take. They can see what you are doing by they can almost they they might not can tell everything, but they'll realize, hey, hey, listen. Something something ain't right with your [Music] list. and and whether whether you want to admit it or not, it can be true. Mhm. It's just because when you when certain things are priorities on your list, you're going to act a certain way. Amen. You're going to do certain things and certain things are going to be important to you above all else. Amen. When God when God is the head of your list, certain things you gonna try to do if you if you ain't helping, you gonna try to make it to church. Amen. You're gonna try to be in service. You going to try You going to try to be around the things of God. You going to try to not be in certain places. Amen. Amen. Because it's a priority about being in the right space and right relationship with God. You going to try to not do certain things. Even if that's your struggle and your battle, you going to try everything within you to fight that because it's a priority with you being right with God. Amen. Amen. When it slips on the priority list, things start to slip in there. Amen. And you wonder what happened. Amen. Well, check out your list. Check out and see, hey, where's your priorities? Check out and see, hey, is it still a pri is God still the number one priority? Is making it to heaven still the number one priority? If it is, then I then something done slipped up in here. I done let something come on the list and I moved up too high and it's too important to me that it shouldn't be. Amen. See, sometimes sometimes you don't realize it, but you've gotten almost to the place where God is the 1A and you got a 1B instead of just God being number one. Amen. And and and it it it becomes a real thing. But you have to examine it. You have to sit down and say, "Lord, have I gotten to that place? Lord, have have I gotten to a place that this isn't a number one priority? It's not that I don't believe in you. It's not that I don't see that you moving. It's not that I don't see that you doing wonderful things with Lord. Where do I have you on my list? Amen. Where do I have you moving in my and being a priority for me? I want to read something. He said, "And as Paul said, now there's one thing that I want to make sure of. While I can in my right mind, I want to make sure that I know him in the power of his resurrection. No matter what else takes place, if I die a popper and they bury me in a potter's field or my grave shall be in the bottom of the river or the sea, wherever it may be, I want to know one thing. I want to know him. That's all that counts. Now, that's right, to know him and the power of his resurrection. For I know this, there's a great big door set out in front of me, and it's called death. And it's for each one of us. And every time one heart beats, we're one beat closer to that door. It won't beat that beat again. We're one beat closer. And one of these days, we're coming up to that door. It's called death. And each one of us is going to meet it. And when I get there, I sure don't want to go in there like a coward. I want to go in there with my robes wrapped around me and his grace knowing this one thing that when he calls I'll come out of there someday. I said that's what I live for today is to do that to know him and to serve him. See I ask on when you when you examine and you look at your life where is he on your priority list? Where is where where where where is God when you go to think about it and say, "Lord, I where is he? Is he on the list?" Because that that's a that's a whole another question that I can't answer for you. I can't get you closer to God than you want to be with him. We can have Bible study every day, service every night. That don't mean that you going to grow closer to God. Amen. We can have prayer service every night and deliverance service. That don't mean that you going to grow closer to God. It's when you decide in your individual self, Lord, I want you to work in me. Lord, I want you to do something in my life. Lord, I want you to change my life. Lord, I want to completely surrender to you. Lord, I want you to put you first in everything. Lord, I want to make you the number one priority in my life. That's when things are changing your life. That's when things have become the best thing in your life. That's when that's when they talk about and said Jesus was the best thing that I've ever done. That's what they mean when they say that. Amen. Is when you set him as the number one priority. And you said, Lord, take complete control over my life. Lord, not my will but thy will be done. And Jesus had to come to that point. So do you and I. So do you and I. We have to come to him and say, "Lord, I want to put you as the number one priority in my life. Lord, I realize that my priority list has gotten changed up and mixed up and I've evaluated and put some things higher, but now today, today is my opportunity to make the best decision and make the best choice." Amen. Today is your opportunity this morning. Amen. Let us bow. Lord Jesus, we thank you for allowing us to come into your house.
