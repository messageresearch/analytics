[32:50] make it I just pray about God by the
[32:53] holy spirit that you might go by and see
[32:55] about him Lord for we thank you Lord we
[32:58] love you in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[33:00] amen
[33:02] God is good amen we want to look at the
[33:05] Book of Genesis by God's grace Genesis 1
[33:08] and we'll begin at the 24th verse
[33:25] God is good amen
[33:28] Genesis 1 and 24.
[33:33] we got to say Amen
[33:35] and it reads and God said let the Earth
[33:39] bring forth the living creature after
[33:41] his kind cattle and creeping thing and
[33:43] beast of the earth after his kind and it
[33:46] was so and God made the beasts of the
[33:48] earth after his kind and cattle after
[33:50] their kind and every creeping thing that
[33:52] creepeth upon the Earth after his kind
[33:55] and God saw that it was good and God
[33:58] said let us make man in our own image
[34:00] after our likeness and let them have
[34:03] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[34:05] over the fall of the air and over the
[34:08] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[34:10] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[34:12] the Earth so God created man in his own
[34:15] image in the image of God created he him
[34:18] male and female he created he them and
[34:21] God blessed them and God said unto them
[34:22] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[34:25] the Earth and subdue it and have
[34:26] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[34:28] over the father of the air and over to
[34:29] every living thing that moveth upon the
[34:32] Earth may God have bless the reading of
[34:34] his words you may be seated tonight
[34:37] by the grace of God just for a moment I
[34:39] just want to minister on a little
[34:41] something don't tend to be long tonight
[34:43] just on a little something that I've
[34:46] been ministering on the last couple of
[34:47] weeks and and I entitled it in His image
[34:51] and likeness Amen in His image and
[34:54] likeness so we see here you know in the
[34:57] setting of The Scriptures you know we
[34:59] know about the whole creation and how
[35:01] God you know spoke things into existence
[35:04] and you know everything we see is a
[35:06] product of the spoken word of God and
[35:08] you know just how powerful it was God's
[35:11] voice in creating all these things but
[35:13] you know and and when God created
[35:15] everything you know the Bible said and
[35:17] he saw it and it was good so God created
[35:21] everything everything God created was
[35:22] good it was nothing bad about it so you
[35:25] know we find that you know in the
[35:27] creation you know and God created this
[35:30] place you know sometimes we think about
[35:32] that place and you know they're in Eden
[35:35] and how you know we can see Perfection
[35:37] sometimes like we said at its best we
[35:40] see a place of no violence no sickness
[35:43] no pain no tiredness no worriation or
[35:46] none of these things indeed and it was a
[35:48] perfect place because that was a place
[35:51] that God had created and it was good
[35:53] wasn't it so we saw that you know and I
[35:55] says that you know we find today that
[35:58] you know he says what happened to to
[36:01] that place because sometimes when you
[36:04] talk about that place it's just some
[36:06] place of Mythology in in uh the human
[36:09] mind today because they can't even
[36:11] conceive that there is is even a place
[36:14] of perfection like that but God created
[36:18] a place and he created you and I to be
[36:20] in that place but through the fall
[36:22] that's why we see it when we look at
[36:25] today what's going on we look at the
[36:27] world in a fallen state we look at the
[36:29] condition of the people what it is
[36:31] they're in a fallen State you know I
[36:34] believe the Bible says that whole earth
[36:35] was grown and in travail waiting on the
[36:38] manifestations of the sons of God why is
[36:40] the earth grown and because it knows
[36:43] that there is a place of perfection it
[36:45] knows that there is a place where
[36:47] there's no death where there's no
[36:48] violence and all these things where
[36:50] there's they know that everything is out
[36:53] of cater come on so it's waiting on you
[36:55] and I it's grown and you know in travail
[36:57] until now waiting on you and I because
[37:00] it desires itself to get back to that
[37:02] place y'all believe that tonight so we
[37:05] see that that you know everything is
[37:07] everything is out of care because of the
[37:09] Fall everything is out of catered thrown
[37:11] all out away right you see that you say
[37:14] it's so bad out of cater that that that
[37:16] now we look at it in his entirety that
[37:19] the wrong is right
[37:21] and the riot is wrong and we look at
[37:23] that's just the state of man today
[37:26] because while he's at his Fallen State
[37:28] we look at it that you know we talk
[37:30] about it many of times that you know
[37:32] they're they're in a reprobate state
[37:35] in the mind frame to where they know
[37:37] that these things are wrong but you know
[37:39] one thing about even in being in that
[37:41] reprobate state that I always look at
[37:43] that the Bible says that when they knew
[37:46] God they glorified him not come on
[37:49] they'd rather worship the creature the
[37:52] Creator the creature more than the
[37:53] Creator
[37:54] the Bible talked about you know it ain't
[37:57] that they that they never knew they
[37:58] didn't know no better but when they knew
[38:00] God they didn't want him
[38:02] they they became vain in their own
[38:04] imaginations they wanted the things that
[38:07] were evil and they kicked up against God
[38:09] they they this
[38:11] you know you know uh kicked them out or
[38:13] they didn't want them in their
[38:14] imaginations they didn't want to retain
[38:15] God in their knowledge so in all these
[38:18] things what did God do he turned them
[38:20] over to that reprobate State you didn't
[38:22] want God so now I'ma turn you over to
[38:25] that thing you know that those things
[38:26] you're doing are bad those things you
[38:28] deserve that people are dying that I
[38:30] destroyed people for them right but you
[38:32] want to do them anyway so since you
[38:34] desire and that's what's in your heart
[38:36] I'm gonna give it to you and I'm gonna
[38:37] let you have pleasure in while you're
[38:38] doing them and in the end I'm gonna
[38:40] judge you by it ain't that what God said
[38:42] come on so I says that you know what it
[38:45] is that's because that's what was in
[38:46] their heart the whole time wasn't it you
[38:49] know that's why we asked God all the
[38:50] time lord search my heart
[38:52] and try my range don't you know God
[38:54] knows everything that's in your heart I
[38:56] was sharing with somebody the other day
[38:58] I said no matter what you do you might
[39:00] can put on a good show in front of man
[39:03] put on a good uh outfit and and disguise
[39:06] and nobody know who you are
[39:08] right but there's one thing about it God
[39:10] knows exactly who you are he notices
[39:12] that he knows exactly where you're
[39:14] sitting at amen everything is naked and
[39:16] laid out before
[39:18] ain't nothing here before God and that's
[39:21] where we in ourselves in our minds
[39:23] sometimes make the biggest mistake is we
[39:26] think that we're getting away from man
[39:27] we hiding but guess what God looking at
[39:30] it the whole time come on and God is a
[39:32] righteous God he's a just God too the
[39:35] only only reason why you know he
[39:37] tolerate us sometime because it's still
[39:39] Blood On The Mercy Seat but you know the
[39:41] only difference between the mercy and
[39:43] the Judgment seat is the blood once that
[39:45] blood is taken away that same Mercy Seat
[39:48] that same place that same Throne where
[39:50] you could have came to and got Mercy you
[39:52] come before nine it's going to be
[39:53] judgment right come on but I don't know
[39:56] about you but I want the mercy of God
[39:57] every morning I wake up I say God I need
[40:00] your mercy God I need your grace I was
[40:02] praying in the car the other day I said
[40:04] Lord I Thank you for being rich in Mercy
[40:06] thank you for being rich in Grace you
[40:09] know I could have been cut off and gone
[40:10] long time ago but Lord I Thank You for
[40:12] Your Mercy help me to stand your way
[40:15] Lord come on search my heart let my
[40:18] heart be on the things of God lord I
[40:21] want you and I want more of you
[40:25] because without you I perish
[40:27] come on do you feel that way tonight
[40:29] I said the mother the darker this world
[40:31] get that's the more I feel that God

[41:31] asking of you looking at all these
[41:33] things tomorrow ain't even promised is
[41:35] it come on like that song say I give my
[41:37] life tomorrow come on but tomorrow ain't
[41:40] promised
[41:41] things turn quickly don't they
[41:43] situations turn bad real quick
[41:47] Hallelujah but it's one thing about it
[41:49] when you know you've done the best you
[41:51] can do and you're in the Master's hands
[41:53] you ain't worried about situations
[41:54] turning and changing because you know
[41:57] that no matter what come your way
[41:59] come on many are they that rise up
[42:01] against you and say that of your soul
[42:03] there ain't no help for you Hallelujah
[42:05] but it's something about you you say
[42:07] that oh Lord You're sure for me you're
[42:10] my glory and the lifter of my head
[42:13] devil saying all these things wolfing
[42:15] doing all these things shooting all kind
[42:17] of fiery darts at you come on but God
[42:20] give us weapons to fight with and that's
[42:22] what I'm putting on the whole armor of
[42:23] God you shouldn't Miss not one piece
[42:26] don't you know that little piece that
[42:27] you leave off that's the Gateway for the
[42:29] devil to get in don't miss not one piece
[42:32] but put on a whole armor come on use all
[42:35] the weapons that God gave you to fight
[42:37] with Hallelujah
[42:39] oh Jesus come on y'all believe that
[42:41] tonight come on but I says that you know
[42:44] in His image and likeness you know God
[42:47] made you and I to be in His image in his
[42:50] likeness he didn't made you to be in
[42:52] that Fallen state
[42:53] come on but the reason why men got men
[42:57] got in that Fallen state is because of
[42:59] what because of sin right
[43:01] come on sin you know in that like we
[43:04] talked about that perfect place and even
[43:06] in that perfect place when you think
[43:08] about that perfect place don't you know
[43:10] that the devil infiltrated and got in
[43:12] that perfect place
[43:14] even in that place the devil found a way
[43:16] to get into that perfect place
[43:19] into that place but even though he found
[43:21] a way you know through the serpent to
[43:23] enter into that place he still couldn't
[43:25] do nothing to Adam and Eve
[43:27] even in that place because as long as
[43:30] they stay with what the word of God said
[43:31] as long as they stay with God even
[43:34] though he might have infiltrated in that
[43:36] place all he can do is talk
[43:38] all he can do is Bluff but they were
[43:40] fortified behind that word nothing that
[43:42] he could throw at him nothing no
[43:44] physical nothing that he can do to him
[43:46] long as they kept that word
[43:48] but what it is he tricked them he
[43:50] tricked Eve you know that she was to see
[43:52] the Bible says the woman was in
[43:53] transgression not the man come on but
[43:56] the thing is he's deceived her to do
[43:58] what come from behind that word right
[44:00] talk to her into believing that oh God
[44:05] was hiding something from them he had
[44:08] something better he didn't give him his
[44:10] best
[44:11] ain't that what he told her come on just
[44:14] in a paraphrase way God ain't give you
[44:16] his best he hiding something from you
[44:18] come on he know that if you you do this
[44:21] then you you'll know more come on you
[44:23] you'll be more but then the Bible says
[44:26] she saw that the tree was the desire was
[44:28] good her eyes deceived or didn't he but
[44:31] God gave them a commandment not only you
[44:33] can't eat of it but don't touch it
[44:35] it's a dangerous thing to even touch it
[44:38] come on because the day you do that's
[44:40] the day you're gonna die but the devil
[44:43] had a way of of of deceiving of
[44:46] captivating her mind you know the
[44:48] prophet of God talked about greatest
[44:49] mistake uh uh she made was when she
[44:52] stopped to even listened to him
[44:54] because he walked right into her mind
[44:56] now I got her all confused the lusting
[44:59] at the things come on ain't that what it
[45:02] is the lust at the things thinking that
[45:04] that that oh yeah he's just trying to he
[45:06] just trying to hold you back for
[45:07] something you know I was I was look
[45:09] ministering not ministering but
[45:10] meditating on that and I was thinking I
[45:12] said you know that's what the devil does
[45:14] mostly to our young people right not
[45:17] just only to them but to the old people
[45:19] too but to the young he'll get them to
[45:21] think oh you know they you've been held
[45:25] back from something
[45:26] you know the devil got something God no
[45:29] he didn't know you're gonna have a good
[45:30] time no you're gonna have fun they don't
[45:32] want you they had they fun now you can
[45:34] go have yours
[45:36] come on
[45:37] but what it is I thought about that I
[45:40] said yes God was holding them back from
[45:42] something
[45:42] from all the pain that they was gonna
[45:44] have to go through
[45:46] he was holding them back from that
[45:48] from all the hardships
[45:51] from those Lonely Nights come on from
[45:54] the Heartbreak in the sorrow God was
[45:56] holding them back from it he was
[45:59] Sheltering them from that what
[46:01] come on
[46:02] he was
[46:03] but they thought that God was holding
[46:06] some back from him but what it is it was
[46:09] a world yes the devil talked to her
[46:11] about another world beyond that world
[46:14] that she was living in
[46:16] talk to her about another world it's a
[46:18] world Beyond this world and it was but
[46:21] in that world it was ruled by different
[46:23] laws in that world
[46:25] in that world it was an eye for an eye
[46:27] come on in that world you couldn't come
[46:30] to that lion and pet that lion no more
[46:32] he eat you up now
[46:35] in that world you didn't have dominion
[46:38] anymore Hallelujah in that world
[46:40] sickness applied in that world
[46:43] Hallelujah despair everything else
[46:46] applied to you in that world
[46:49] but if you would have stayed with God
[46:51] stay with his word you were governed by
[46:54] different laws
[46:55] you were governed by laws where he said
[46:58] I'm the Lord thy God that healeth thee
[47:01] come on you were governed by laws
[47:03] Hallelujah where sickness didn't affect
[47:05] you
[47:06] where you live by one law and that was
[47:09] faith
[47:12] that all things were possible to you in
[47:14] that place hallelujah oh Jesus come on
[47:19] buddy talked to them about another world
[47:21] didn't he and they were now after you
[47:24] know they uh committed the ACT you know
[47:26] they were about to experience all that
[47:28] right now you know they experience it
[47:32] but what it is I thank God that even
[47:34] that in that place when they did that
[47:36] you know God still had a plan to get
[47:39] them back from that Fallen State didn't
[47:40] it come on he had a plan to resurrect
[47:44] them from that place
[47:46] you know and it was going to be through
[47:48] what through his shed blood
[47:50] through the grace of God Amen
[47:52] amen that you and I wasn't even worthy
[47:55] of it come on
[47:57] but the way we came out was wrong
[47:59] but God had a way to get us back to that
[48:01] perfect place
[48:03] and that's what our hearts are longing
[48:05] for that's what all our our president is
[48:08] for all our fighting all our all our
[48:10] digging in prayer is for to do what
[48:14] because something inside of you is
[48:16] saying God didn't create me to be this
[48:18] way come on something inside you is
[48:21] telling you it's Perfection out there
[48:24] it's a place that you press into
[48:26] Hallelujah
[48:28] that's that's been seen to be the
[48:30] mythical to the rest of the world in the
[48:32] science room
[48:33] but to you and I that place ain't
[48:35] mythical
[48:36] but that place is real
[48:39] it's more realer than where we're living
[48:40] at now hallelujah it's all we long for
[48:44] because every day in this body we dying
[48:47] Hallelujah getting weaker ain't you come
[48:50] on every time you turn around bad news
[48:53] heartache and pain
[48:55] but something beside you is longing for
[48:57] that place
[48:58] of perfection
[49:00] God get me out of this state I'm in
[49:02] Hallelujah lift me up into that place to
[49:06] where you are don't you know God want to
[49:08] lift you up tonight Hallelujah
[49:10] [Music]
[49:11] but the devil want to do what keep you
[49:13] in that that mind frame there keep you
[49:16] in that state where you are
[49:17] come on but God is calling you to come
[49:20] on up
[49:21] I want you to come on up to this place
[49:23] hallelujah amen amen the world is dark
[49:25] Holly my my glory is lifting off the
[49:28] Earth come on let me catch you up to
[49:31] this place to where I am
[49:33] but the problem is today it's hard for
[49:35] us to let go of these carnal things
[49:37] hard for us to let go of those things
[49:40] that we so much lusting after
[49:42] come on those things that you keep
[49:44] holding on to them one day they gonna
[49:47] drag you down to the pits hell sometimes
[49:51] you say don't you say that but it's the
[49:53] truth anyhow ain't it come on
[49:56] those things that we hold on too long to
[49:59] dear I was telling somebody the other
[50:01] day I said what you love come on it'll
[50:04] show itself sooner or later
[50:07] you say you love God it'll show up
[50:09] sooner or later
[50:11] oh Jesus y'all believe that tonight
[50:13] let's look at James one
[50:16] glory to God
[50:18] God is good amen In His Image and
[50:21] likeness come on
[50:23] God created you and that's what it is
[50:26] you know I believe it even though God
[50:28] know all things I believe it hurt God
[50:30] the seed him in that Fallen state
[50:34] come on
[50:36] and I believe it it hurts God to see his
[50:39] children in a fallen state
[50:40] come on
[50:42] in a state
[50:44] you know I'll jump all over myself I was
[50:46] thinking about so many characters
[50:48] I thought about Samson
[50:51] and him being in his Fallen state
[50:54] come on
[50:55] God created him for one thing didn't he
[50:58] to be a a deliverer a judge and deliver
[51:01] for the people of Israel
[51:03] right gave him a gift
[51:07] that he was to use come on
[51:11] to be a blessing to the people of God
[51:13] as long as he kept what God Said and
[51:16] kept in a way then no matter what came
[51:19] about
[51:20] the anointing was on Samson
[51:23] Hallelujah and Samson could go out and
[51:26] run thousands couldn't he
[51:28] man he's cornered one time enemies all
[51:31] around him but when he woke up in the
[51:33] presence of God came home
[51:35] no matter who was out there or how they
[51:37] had a corner he picked the whole gates
[51:40] up didn't he out of the ground and
[51:42] carrying them up the hill and sat on
[51:45] he had something about him that that it
[51:48] was a gift that God gave him come on but
[51:51] what it is
[51:53] and and the enemy couldn't do nothing
[51:55] with that gift
[51:56] but what they had to do they had to get
[51:59] in there and get them to get off them
[52:01] to get out of the way of the word get
[52:03] out of the way of what God asked him
[52:05] they had to do something to get him out
[52:07] of that way didn't he
[52:08] but when they when he got out of that
[52:10] way he became just like any other man
[52:13] now Samson Mighty didn't know nothing
[52:16] about that world or what it was like to
[52:18] be weak
[52:19] but when he disobeyed God he was going
[52:22] to find out it was another world out
[52:23] there
[52:24] that what you operated in in the first
[52:26] realm it don't work in that Realm
[52:29] come on because now you came from behind
[52:32] the thing that was covering you
[52:34] you came from behind the thing that was
[52:36] Sheltering you the thing that protected
[52:38] you you're from behind that now
[52:40] so now you open game to the enemy
[52:44] he didn't know that come on
[52:46] you know I like the little illustration
[52:48] of prophet God's talking about and how
[52:51] he said the thing that hurts Samson
[52:53] wasn't memories
[52:54] come on he didn't have eyes anymore but
[52:56] in his mind he can go back
[52:59] in his memory Hallelujah and remember
[53:02] how God used to use him
[53:04] remember how you can reach back and feel
[53:07] those locks as long as he had those
[53:10] locks he knew that the enemy couldn't do
[53:12] nothing to him presence of God was on
[53:15] them because God made a covenant with
[53:17] him
[53:18] Hallelujah and he was fortified behind
[53:21] that
[53:22] but what it is you know the devil same
[53:26] way he did Eve came on come on he's he
[53:30] he took that you know that's one thing
[53:32] about gifts that God give you you know
[53:35] the devil can't create he can only
[53:37] pervert what God has created
[53:39] so what the devil does he'll take that
[53:41] gift that God gave you come on and each
[53:44] and every one of us have one you got to
[53:46] find out God didn't just put you here
[53:48] for nothing but you got to give
[53:50] but you got to find out what gift God
[53:52] has given you
[53:54] and once you find out and operating that
[53:56] gift
[53:57] the power of God will be on your life
[53:59] demons are flavor for you because you
[54:02] know what your gift is hallelujah oh
[54:05] Jesus
[54:06] come on
[54:08] y'all believe that tonight come on but
[54:12] what it is he gave it all up didn't he
[54:14] for a woman
[54:16] didn't he
[54:17] he didn't realize that you know by
[54:20] telling breaking that Covenant with God
[54:22] he didn't realize now he was going to be
[54:25] introduced to another world
[54:27] you know and the thing is you know when
[54:29] you're looking at no we don't have time
[54:30] but when you're looking at us thinking I
[54:32] says that you know the whole time when
[54:35] Delilah was playing around with Samson
[54:37] she tied up Samson the Philistines upon
[54:40] me
[54:41] and she had men the whole time down
[54:44] there in the chamber lying and wait
[54:46] about the coming bind them he up there
[54:48] playing around with the devil Hallelujah
[54:50] not knowing that as soon as that he got
[54:54] the enemy down in the chamber lying and
[54:56] wait lying waiting on a chance
[54:58] to come up and destroy you waiting on a
[55:01] chance
[55:02] to bind you up and pull your eyes out
[55:05] don't you know the devil is doing that
[55:06] today
[55:07] come on only reason why he hadn't come
[55:10] up and pull your eyes out yet because
[55:12] God had been having Grace on you God
[55:15] Mercy been there as a brother saying the
[55:18] song tonight somebody praying for you

[55:22] mercy on them Hallelujah we play around

[55:32] happened you know and it got to that
[55:34] place the way he he came and you know
[55:37] it
[55:38] told his secret
[55:40] broke his Covenant with God didn't he
[55:43] now he he about to experience something
[55:47] he never experienced before in a bad way
[55:50] wasn't he

[59:32] His image and likeness come on you know
[59:35] James 1 and 13. we got to say Amen
[59:38] and it reads let no man say
[59:41] when he is tempted I am tempted of God
[59:44] for God cannot be tempted with evil
[59:47] neither tempted he any man but every man
[59:51] is tempted when he is drawn away with
[59:54] his own what lust and entice then when
[59:58] lust hath conceived it bringeth forth
[1:00:01] sin and sin when it finished bringeth
[1:00:04] forth death do not error my beloved
[1:00:07] brother
[1:00:08] you know I said man in this Fallen State
[1:00:10] you know the reason why the whole fall
[1:00:14] and all those things we know God had a
[1:00:16] plan and all these things but lust
[1:00:18] brought that about didn't it come on
[1:00:20] lustin
[1:00:21] from for more lusting for more of what
[1:00:24] something Desiring for the eyes good to
[1:00:26] the eyes all that's you know the Bible
[1:00:27] talked about all the things of life
[1:00:29] right the lust of the flesh the uh the
[1:00:32] lust of the eyes of the pride of life
[1:00:33] lust and all those things what it says
[1:00:35] that you know that all these things when
[1:00:38] Lusty said when you say you tempted it
[1:00:40] don't say you tempted of God but you're
[1:00:42] tempted because of your own lust right
[1:00:44] the devil know what you like and he
[1:00:46] tempted you with it come on and you fell
[1:00:49] because of those things but he said
[1:00:51] remember when you do all those things
[1:00:52] and said that's him when lust you know
[1:00:54] the brain for sin and with sin and when
[1:00:56] it's done it's going to bring forth
[1:00:57] death come on it's a downhill spiral
[1:01:00] ain't it and there's no getting around
[1:01:02] that sometimes people say well I don't
[1:01:04] go too far I ain't gonna no it's a
[1:01:05] downhill spiral
[1:01:07] come on and in the end what is it going
[1:01:09] to bring about death
[1:01:10] but it takes the spirit of God
[1:01:13] come on God has sent his word but will
[1:01:15] you hear his word you know I was in
[1:01:17] prayer today and and something just came
[1:01:19] to me and said you know you know you
[1:01:21] think about hard-headed people says and
[1:01:24] just says that you know people are hard
[1:01:26] of hearing
[1:01:27] they can't hear they can't hear God's
[1:01:30] word
[1:01:31] they hear it naturally but it's
[1:01:33] something about he said he that happened
[1:01:35] ear let them hear Jesus was speaking
[1:01:38] right but people couldn't hear what he
[1:01:40] was saying
[1:01:41] and don't you know it's that same way
[1:01:43] today people they can hear you speaking
[1:01:46] they can hear the word being preached
[1:01:48] but they can't hear what you're saying
[1:01:50] he said he that happened ear what does
[1:01:52] it take for you to have an ear the Holy
[1:01:54] Ghost
[1:01:55] we've got to take the Holy Ghost to give
[1:01:57] you that ear to hear that the word ain't
[1:02:00] just a letter or or some good something
[1:02:03] you heard but when you hear it through
[1:02:05] those channels it goes down into the
[1:02:07] realm of the Soul
[1:02:09] and it exposes you it shows you where
[1:02:11] you are Hallelujah
[1:02:13] shows you where you where you at what
[1:02:15] you need a little more of
[1:02:17] God I need a little more of you come on
[1:02:20] buddy just came to me today I said you
[1:02:22] know people are hard here and they've
[1:02:24] heard of understanding come on as I was
[1:02:27] sharing I believe it was uh a brother
[1:02:29] Damon the other day we were talking
[1:02:31] about some things and you know about
[1:02:33] just about false Doctrine and all and I
[1:02:36] was saying he was saying that you know
[1:02:37] he was saying he told me like this said
[1:02:40] I remember because he was he was real
[1:02:42] smart so he's studied a lot a little
[1:02:44] studying a lot of things and he said but
[1:02:46] I remember you telling me that don't
[1:02:49] worry about all those other names don't
[1:02:50] worry about all those other things but
[1:02:52] there's no power like that in the name
[1:02:53] of Jesus
[1:02:54] there's no power he says I don't
[1:02:57] remember telling him but he says you
[1:02:58] told me that you know that name Jesus
[1:03:00] that's the name you need to call on
[1:03:02] don't worry about all this that name
[1:03:03] Jesus he said I found out that is
[1:03:05] something different in that name
[1:03:08] he said that name he says it does
[1:03:10] something for me that name he said
[1:03:11] that's the only name that ever did
[1:03:13] something for me
[1:03:14] and I thank God but I began to tell you
[1:03:17] know my friend brother Damon I was
[1:03:18] telling him I said you know the thing
[1:03:19] about it is we're talking about how can
[1:03:21] this one be deceived how can that one
[1:03:23] the doctrine and all that thing I said
[1:03:25] because I says that you know the only
[1:03:27] reason why we can hear and see in in act
[1:03:30] and move is because God is is because of
[1:03:34] by-election
[1:03:35] I say this election election by Grace
[1:03:38] nothing you've done nothing you chose
[1:03:40] nothing none of that come on but before
[1:03:42] the foundation of the world when God had
[1:03:45] us in his mind come on he can write our
[1:03:48] names on the Lambs with a life right
[1:03:49] there Hallelujah because no matter what
[1:03:52] where you were born at what family
[1:03:54] what place the uh Darkness you were in
[1:03:57] no matter where you were at Hallelujah
[1:03:59] God knew that one day when he called you
[1:04:01] you'd hear his voice
[1:04:04] and all the Demons of hell would have to
[1:04:06] Turn You Loose no matter what Walk of
[1:04:09] Life Family you came from
[1:04:12] God wrote you know his thoughts
[1:04:14] concerning you wrote your name there
[1:04:17] and the devil was gonna have to let you
[1:04:19] go that's what we're rejoicing about
[1:04:22] not that the devil's a subject but that
[1:04:24] because our name is written there
[1:04:26] Hallelujah
[1:04:28] and the only reason why we see is
[1:04:30] because election thank God for his grace
[1:04:33] nothing I've done nothing you done but
[1:04:36] it's a grace of God
[1:04:38] thank God he give us eyes to see thank
[1:04:41] God he gave us ears to hear
[1:04:43] Hallelujah
[1:04:45] oh Jesus the devil give us give you so
[1:04:48] many things that seem like that that'll
[1:04:51] change the whole world give you this to
[1:04:53] give you that but you realize Hallelujah
[1:04:56] that it's more riches in Christ
[1:05:00] then all the world got off
[1:05:03] all the money they can throw before

[1:05:08] oh you can have this or that more money
[1:05:11] they tell you that all the time come on
[1:05:14] but there's one thing about it I don't
[1:05:16] need money when I got God

[1:05:21] but with God I got all things

[1:05:52] devil had me bound
[1:05:54] when I doing things I ain't had no
[1:05:56] control of where was all of it then I
[1:05:58] know where God was right there waiting

[1:07:05] but I say it's what it is being made in
[1:07:08] this image come on in likeness God made
[1:07:10] us in His image
[1:07:11] come on but man has found himself where
[1:07:14] in that Fallen state right
[1:07:17] come on but drawing away from their with
[1:07:20] their own lust right he said and you
[1:07:22] know one thing I was sharing with the
[1:07:23] Bible study I don't want to be long
[1:07:25] let's share the Bible study the other
[1:07:27] night says you know me and Charlotte was
[1:07:30] talking one night and said a lot of
[1:07:31] times people are say uh
[1:07:35] you know they always bring up David was
[1:07:38] a man after God's Own Heart look at what
[1:07:41] he did
[1:07:42] David was this and that but you know
[1:07:44] what time you know what it is
[1:07:46] sometimes people will use that
[1:07:49] because they want to cover for their own
[1:07:50] sins or make an excuse for the reason
[1:07:53] why they act the way they act or they do
[1:07:54] the things they do come on but it's one
[1:07:57] characteristic that David had that a lot
[1:07:59] of people don't have he was quick to
[1:08:01] repent wasn't he
[1:08:04] he was real with it wasn't he
[1:08:06] he did it wrong he said Lord come on
[1:08:09] creating me a clean heart and renew the
[1:08:12] right Spirit In Me
[1:08:14] come on cast me not away from thy
[1:08:16] presence wasn't just a song Daddy's song
[1:08:19] but it was something down in his heart
[1:08:21] he was always quick to repent not only
[1:08:24] that I said you can pay yourself to
[1:08:26] David but do you want to go through what
[1:08:29] he went through
[1:08:30] he went through some terrible times
[1:08:33] didn't he
[1:08:34] one child killed the other lost a baby
[1:08:38] one son raped the daughter not the same
[1:08:41] son that killed the other tried to take
[1:08:43] the kingdom
[1:08:44] did all kinds he suffered all kind of
[1:08:47] things for that didn't he
[1:08:49] come on
[1:08:51] but he was quick to repent
[1:08:53] but we don't use those things come on
[1:08:56] you draw away with your own lust and all
[1:08:59] those things that's not come on I said
[1:09:00] at any time a man's got an excuse for
[1:09:04] the way he is the way he is that isn't
[1:09:06] real repentance
[1:09:09] real repentance come from within
[1:09:11] where you see yourself naked out before
[1:09:14] God
[1:09:15] Lord it ain't nobody fault but my own
[1:09:19] God I am the way that I am I'm sorry
[1:09:21] Lord I need your help
[1:09:23] creating me a clean heart
[1:09:26] here I am naked before you
[1:09:29] I'm the man I'm the reason while I am
[1:09:32] the way I am God will look down on a
[1:09:34] person like that come on and I believe
[1:09:36] you'll have mercy on them do you believe
[1:09:38] that tonight come on I know we just all
[1:09:41] over the place I said In His Image and
[1:09:43] likeness God didn't create you to be
[1:09:45] this way come on God didn't create you
[1:09:48] just to be that's just who I am God
[1:09:50] didn't treat you like that
[1:09:52] but he created you in His image didn't
[1:09:54] he his likeness
[1:09:56] he you you should be like to say when we
[1:09:58] see him we'll be like him
[1:10:00] he created you to be like him

[1:10:18] his likeness how was he walking didn't
[1:10:21] have a the the foxes had a hole the
[1:10:24] birds had nests he ain't had a place to
[1:10:25] lay his head did he walking with dirty
[1:10:28] feet he came to his own his own received
[1:10:31] him not come on he didn't walk with his
[1:10:34] head up proud but the Bible says we

[1:10:37] Afflicted come on when we seen him
[1:10:40] there's no beauty that we shouldn't
[1:10:42] desire them but we hear this and we're
[1:10:43] our faces from them

[1:10:46] come on but God come on gave him a
[1:10:50] portion with the great didn't he said

[1:18:04] but I have another chance
[1:18:06] to tell God I appreciate you
[1:18:09] amen
[1:18:12] the things I just thought of I I keep
[1:18:15] thinking about it you know
[1:18:17] I was listening to
[1:18:19] sturgeon in different ones and Smith
[1:18:21] with the words and all those different
[1:18:24] people and I said well yeah people
[1:18:28] and one thing I think sturgeon said if
[1:18:31] we're not having
[1:18:34] pledging in serving the lord if we're
[1:18:36] not happy people
[1:18:37] we just don't understand what God done
[1:18:39] for us
[1:18:41] then I was looking at the prophet to God
[1:18:43] and Christ's mystery of God revealed and
[1:18:47] he said you know something he said God
[1:18:50] predestinated us and chose us in him
[1:18:52] before the foundation of the world and
[1:18:55] he was going back to Ephesians 1 and
[1:18:57] saying that he said you know
[1:18:59] God had a purpose in his mind
[1:19:02] and he knew that Eve would fall because
[1:19:06] the lamb was slain in the mind of God
[1:19:08] before the foundation of the world and
[1:19:10] we were in him
[1:19:12] then
[1:19:13] are you with me
[1:19:15] we were in him then and because you were
[1:19:19] in him then you're here now
[1:19:21] amen and you're saying what
[1:19:25] is the land
[1:19:27] Hallelujah
[1:19:29] we can sing a new song
[1:19:31] why did the lamb that was
[1:19:35] Hallelujah
[1:19:37] and God knows we mean it from our heart
[1:19:39] we're not just singing a song because it
