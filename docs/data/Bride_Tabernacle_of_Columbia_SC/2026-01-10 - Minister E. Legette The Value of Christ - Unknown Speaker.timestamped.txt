[38:08] children. Bless those that are here.
[38:10] Bless those that had a desire to come
[38:11] but couldn't make it at night. Oh God, I
[38:14] pray you continue touching lives and
[38:15] bodies. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[38:17] pray. Let the church say, "Amen."
[38:21] God is good. Amen.
[38:23] We want to look at the book of of uh St.
[38:26] John by the grace of God 19 and St. John
[38:31] 1. Amen. St. John 1 and 19. They kind of
[38:34] deviate just a little bit from faith.
[38:37] Amen.
[38:38] It's something that was going over with
[38:41] the children the other night in Bible
[38:42] study that kind of got me stirred a
[38:44] little bit. Amen.
[38:47] St. John 1
[38:49] and 19. If you got it, say amen. And it
[38:54] reads, "And this is the record of John
[38:56] when the Jews sent priests and Levites
[38:59] from Jerusalem to ask him, who art
[39:01] thou?"
[39:05] I might need the screen. I don't
[39:10] Let's see.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; And he confessed and denied not not but
[39:17] confessed, I am not the Christ. And they
[39:20] asked him, what then art thou Elias? And
[39:24] he said, I am not. Art thou not the
[39:27] prophet? And he answered, no. Then said
[39:30] they unto him, Who art thou? that we may
[39:34] give an answer to them that sent us.
[39:37] What says thou of thyself? You may be
[39:39] seated. I'm going to read down a little
[39:40] further. He said, I am the voice of one
[39:45] crying in the wilderness, make straight
[39:47] the way of the Lord, as said the prophet
[39:49] Isaiah, and they which were sent were of
[39:53] the Pharisees. And they asked him and
[39:55] said unto him, Why baptize thou then if
[39:58] thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, nor
[40:02] that prophet? John answered them,
[40:05] saying, I baptize with water, but there
[40:08] standeth one among you, when whom ye
[40:12] know not, he it is who who cometh after
[40:17] me is preferred before me, whose shoes
[40:20] latched, I'm not worthy to unloose.
[40:23] These things were done in the besta
[40:27] beyond Jordan, where John was baptized.
[40:30] The next day John seeth Jesus cometh
[40:33] unto coming unto him and says behold the
[40:37] lamb of God who take away the sins of
[40:40] the world. This is he of whom I said
[40:43] after me cometh a man which is preferred
[40:47] before me. For he was before me and I
[40:50] knew him not but that he should be made
[40:53] manifest to Israel. Therefore I am come
[40:56] baptized with water. And John bear
[41:00] record saying I saw the spirit descended
[41:02] from heaven like a dove and it abode
[41:05] upon him. We can stop right there. I
[41:08] just tonight by the grace of God for
[41:11] just for a moment I want to talk about
[41:13] the value of Christ. Amen. The value of
[41:16] Christ. You know John here. One thing
[41:20] about John. John knew how important
[41:24] Christ would be when he come. Amen.
[41:27] You know, and when I say the value of
[41:29] him, you know, you know, John, when they
[41:32] was asking John who he was and what was
[41:35] his role, I guess, to play and he was
[41:37] saying, "I'm not the one." He says, "But
[41:40] he said there's one coming." He says,
[41:42] you know, among you now, he says that
[41:44] I'm not even worthy to un loose the
[41:46] latchet of his shoes off his feet.
[41:48] Right? So John knew that when he was
[41:52] pointed out, all the attention should be
[41:54] on him. Right? But we find today that
[41:58] people they want to put attention
[42:00] everywhere else but on Christ, right?
[42:02] But the importance of Christ, he he's
[42:05] more valuable. As I was saying to the
[42:08] children the other night, I says one day
[42:10] people will realize that Jesus Christ
[42:14] was more important to them than anything
[42:16] in this world.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, just think about that. And
[42:21] something kind of got in my spirit and I
[42:24] was telling people, you know, I was
[42:25] praying for people this week and I says,
[42:27] you know, I was telling everybody I was
[42:29] talking to, I said, you know, one thing
[42:31] I says, one day you're going to realize
[42:34] everything else out of all the things
[42:36] you you chase after in life and all your
[42:39] achievements and all of your goals,
[42:42] right? Which we have to do things to
[42:43] live on this earth, right? I says, but
[42:45] you're going to realize one day and I
[42:48] hope you on the right side, right? that
[42:51] he was more important than all that,
[42:53] right? He was more important. How many
[42:55] believe that tonight?
[42:57] &gt;&gt; John when he saw him, you know, like I
[43:00] says, all the importance was on him,
[43:02] John says, I ain't even worthy to loose
[43:04] your shoes, Lazar, right? I ain't even
[43:06] worthy. He says, he says when he come,
[43:08] right, he says, but when he saw him, he
[43:10] says, behold the lamb of God, right?
[43:13] This is the one that I've been talking
[43:14] to y'all about. I come to baptize only
[43:17] just to prepare the way for him. He says
[43:20] but but now he's here right and he says
[43:23] in one place he says I must I must
[43:25] decrease right and he got to increase
[43:28] but all the focus right I could see it
[43:31] even when they said that the the
[43:33] salutation reached Elizabeth's dear
[43:35] before John was born she said the babe
[43:37] in her womb leapt for joy right because
[43:39] it was all about him right don't you
[43:42] know that I says all of our our makeup
[43:45] all of our being all the things you know
[43:47] is thinking about in this life. Hey, I
[43:49] just been meditating on this this week.
[43:51] I said, all of that, you know, I was
[43:53] searching seem like for and all of that
[43:55] you say you can achieve and all this,
[43:57] but all of that, don't you know that
[43:59] after after it's all said and done, it
[44:01] won't be one stone left upon another,
[44:03] right? All of that that you you bu all
[44:06] that you're trying to get, all you're
[44:07] trying to achieve, all you're building,
[44:09] which God blesses us, right? blesses us
[44:11] with you know like he says one place the
[44:15] scripture says the heavens or heavens
[44:17] cannot contain thee right says heaven is
[44:19] is his throne earth is his foottool what
[44:21] house will you build me all these things
[44:24] don't you know he feels all in all
[44:26] hallelujah so to make him the main focus
[44:29] of your life right I said how important
[44:32] how is the values how important is he
[44:35] don't you know he's like we always say
[44:38] uh shar my my friend he says that he was
[44:40] he he was a man. I say he was more than
[44:42] a man. He was he was everything. Right?
[44:45] Not only was he everything, he still is
[44:48] everything.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. How valuable is he to me? He's
[44:51] my healer. Hallelujah.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; He's my savior. Right. He's my provider.
[44:56] Everything that I need. I don't got to
[44:58] go to nobody else. He's got it all that
[45:00] I need. Hallelujah.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's how valuable he is.
[45:04] Right. So, I was playing with the
[45:06] children. Not playing with them. God
[45:08] knows. We was talking to him the other
[45:09] night in Bible study, right? And I says,
[45:12] "What we going to do? We going to make
[45:14] like this judgment day, right?" I says,
[45:17] "What we'll do?" And I explained to them
[45:19] how we being judged now that we don't
[45:20] have to be judged later because judgment
[45:22] begins at the house of God, right? I
[45:25] says, "But I'm going to say, come on." I
[45:27] said, Josiah, I says, "You have to stand
[45:30] before the throne of judgment, right?" I
[45:33] says, "Why shouldn't God let you in?"
[45:35] Right? Is it because of how good you
[45:38] been? You can't say, right? Is it
[45:41] because of your mama? Because of your
[45:42] daddy? Because your uncle Ernest a
[45:44] preacher? I said, everybody else might
[45:47] be good, might have did good, might have
[45:49] lived good, right? I said, but don't you
[45:51] know, not one of us can take your place
[45:52] on that day?
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; I said, a lot of people don't don't they
[45:57] don't grasp that in their mind. They
[45:59] they might look at my mama, my daddy,
[46:02] right? And and though we might be
[46:03] sitting on you might be sitting on the
[46:05] other side and say, "Yeah, but one thing
[46:07] about it, when you stand before God, you
[46:10] got to answer for yourself."
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? Can somebody say
[46:15] amen? Hallelujah.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; That's the truth, ain't it? You got to
[46:19] stand by yourself, right? And you got to
[46:21] answer. And I says one thing about it,
[46:24] we I said, "Come on, plead your case."
[46:26] Right? And the thing about it is I said,
[46:28] "But you know one thing on that day you
[46:30] going to have no case to plead." Right?
[46:33] I says, "Because what it is," I was
[46:34] telling him, I said, "Play back the
[46:35] tape." Every service that you sat in,
[46:39] right? The man of God preached the word,
[46:41] didn't he? Called out, called you to
[46:44] give your life to God. Give your heart
[46:46] to God. Try to tell you that Jesus was
[46:48] the best thing that you can decision you
[46:50] could ever make. Called out to you.
[46:52] Right? I says, "Play back the tape. What
[46:54] did you do? Did you move or did you just
[46:55] sit still? Right. Come on. Let's play
[46:58] back the tape. So, we were going and I
[47:00] saw that. I says, "Lord," I says, "But
[47:02] what it is, this is going to be real
[47:04] now, ain't it?"
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Come on. I says, "But when before you
[47:07] leave here, I believe you already know
[47:09] where you where you're going at." Come
[47:11] on. Because of what it is, I said God
[47:13] won't have to judge you, right? You'll
[47:15] judge yourself by the decisions that you
[47:17] made, right?
[47:18] &gt;&gt; I says, "But one thing that you'll
[47:20] realize on that day, right?" I says even
[47:23] even with you and I as Christians,
[47:26] right? I look at and I was going over
[47:28] that scripture. I believe it's Isaiah
[47:30] Isaiah 60 or 61 or so or 63 somewhere
[47:33] somewhere in there. It says, "But all
[47:34] your righteousness, right, is as what?
[47:37] Filthy rags, ain't it?" I said, even I
[47:40] can't say, "Lord, I won't let me in. I
[47:42] did this. I did that." Come on. None of
[47:44] that ain't going to matter. All of that
[47:45] is as filthy rags. Right? Why? Because I
[47:48] can only do for God because God allowed
[47:50] me. Right? If God hadn't come, it's all
[47:53] about him. See, the value is all on him
[47:55] now, right?
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Because remember, if he hadn't have
[47:58] chose you, you'd have been lost just
[47:59] like everybody else.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; If he hadn't have known you, right?
[48:03] Hallelujah. From the beginning and wrote
[48:05] your name there, you'd have been lost
[48:07] like everybody else, wouldn't you? Come
[48:08] on. It wasn't about you. He says,
[48:11] "Before you was formed in your mother's
[48:13] womb, I already knew you, right? I chose
[48:15] you. You didn't chose choose me."
[48:17] Hallelujah. So what all the focus is on
[48:20] to him that makes us say Lord thank you
[48:22] for choosing me. Hallelujah. Oh God out
[48:25] of all that you could have chose. I'm so
[48:27] glad that you chose me. Right. COME ON.
[48:30] OH GOD THAT'S HOW much valuable you are.
[48:32] Cuz all of the good that I THINK I I
[48:34] DONE IN LIFE DON'T MEAN NOTHING. THIS
[48:36] HAS FILTHY RAGS. RIGHT.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; John says I I might be John might could
[48:40] have says I'm voiceing one crying IN THE
[48:43] WILDERNESS. BUT I'mma tell you, even all
[48:45] that I'm doing, I ain't even worthy to
[48:48] loose the latch on the shoe. Right?
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; I ain't even worthy that. But one thing
[48:54] about it, he was the lamb. Hallelujah.
[48:56] When I need when you need somebody in
[48:58] that day, I said you're going to realize
[49:00] how important Jesus was. Hallelujah.
[49:03] That I can't say speak of none of the
[49:05] good that I done, but it's all of what
[49:07] he's done for me. Hallelujah. I can see
[49:09] Jesus saying, "You stood for me. Now I'm
[49:12] going to stand for you." Hallelujah. I
[49:14] ain't look the father. I ain't looking
[49:15] at what they done, but I'm looking at
[49:17] the blood and the lamb that was slain.
[49:19] Hallelujah. So, how important will we be
[49:21] then? Come on. Oh, Jesus. Come on. ALL
[49:25] THE MONEY YOU HAVE. I says one thing
[49:27] about it. I was looking looking once at
[49:30] a at a video and they had they had uh
[49:33] Michael Jackson, right?
[49:36] He dropped out of the ceiling
[49:39] and he come out the ceiling and by the
[49:42] time he got to the stage with them
[49:44] lowering them on the thing probably
[49:47] 5,000 people done passed out.
[49:51] Come on. And he stood there
[49:54] for about 10 minutes. Then he moved his
[49:57] arm to his glasses. Another 5,000
[50:00] probably passed out. Come on. He pulled
[50:03] them glasses down. in the first 20
[50:05] minutes he ain't done nothing and I
[50:06] don't know how many people they done
[50:08] ambulance coming to get him they were so
[50:10] excited about seeing Michael Jackson
[50:13] come on BUT ONE THING ABOUT MICHAEL
[50:15] Jackson on that day how much fame how
[50:18] much money no matter what he going to
[50:20] need he going to need the lamb right
[50:23] &gt;&gt; come on somebody say amen with me
[50:26] &gt;&gt; come on now is it true
[50:28] &gt;&gt; it's true AIN'T IT
[50:30] &gt;&gt; THE VALUE of them right I SAYS WHEN YOUR
[50:32] EYES CLOSE NOBODY NOBODY CAN'T TALK FOR
[50:34] YOU. Come on.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; That's why they said, "Let the words you
[50:37] done speak for you." Right? But I'm
[50:39] going TO SAY IT LIKE THIS. Even your
[50:40] works is as filthy rags, AIN'T IT? I
[50:43] WANT THE LAMB TO SPEAK for me.
[50:44] Hallelujah. I want the lamb to say when
[50:46] they say, "Play back the tape."
[50:48] HALLELUJAH. HE MIGHT HAVE HAD HIS FAULTS
[50:50] as ups AND DOWNS. BUT ONE THING ABOUT
[50:52] IT, IN HIS HEART, THAT'S WHERE I CAME
[50:54] IN. HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE PREACHER CALLED
[50:56] OR WHEN I CALLED FOR HIM, HE ANSWERED.
[50:59] HALLELUJAH. AND I CAME INTO HIS HEART.
[51:01] AND IT WASN'T ALL AT ONCE SOMETIME, BUT
[51:03] LITTLE BY LITTLE, HE ALLOWED ME TO MAKE
[51:05] CHANGES. HALLELUJAH.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; WENT FROM ONE ROOM TO THE NEXT, SWEEPING
[51:09] IT OUT.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; OH, that makes me feel all right.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; One room to the next. Come on.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; I says you got to when you think GOD
[51:19] FINISHED WITH YOU, God open another
[51:21] door. A little another hidden door.

[51:29] HE OPENED THAT DOOR. YOU JUST as proud
[51:30] as everybody else, right? Let me go in
[51:32] there and sweep that room out.
[51:34] Hallelujah.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that God cleans us up.
[51:37] Right?
[51:38] &gt;&gt; I said judgment begins at the HOUSE OF
[51:40] GOD. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DON'T PREACH
[51:42] NO HARD. DON'T SAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT
[51:43] TO BE JUDGED NOW. WE BE JUDGED THEN.
[51:45] RIGHT? BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, I'LL SAY,
[51:47] "GOD, JUDGE ME NOW.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; EXPOSE MY LIFE. OPEN UP EVERY DOOR,
[51:51] EVERY ROOM. LET ME SEE WHERE I AM, GOD."
[51:54] HALLELUJAH. IT MIGHT HURT MY FEELINGS,
[51:56] BUT LET ME SEE WHERE I'M AT. LET ME BE
[51:58] HUMBLE ENOUGH TO SAY, "LORD, I'M THE
[52:01] MAN." HALLELUJAH. CLEAN ME UP.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; COME ON. HOW MANY want to be cleaned up
[52:06] tonight?
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. And when you think you
[52:09] cleaned up, God said, "I got to clean
[52:10] you up some more." Hallelujah.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; What it is, God let stuff happen to show
[52:14] you you got to come a little bit
[52:16] further, right?
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe that. Right.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. We glory not in our faults, but
[52:23] we glory and God loves us enough to show
[52:25] us where we wrong at. Right. Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; To show us where the pride, the sin of
[52:29] pride is in your life.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; You thank you somebody, right?
[52:34] &gt;&gt; You think you it is. SO GOD SOMETIMES
[52:36] HUMBLE YOU DOWN, BREAK YOU DOWN, RIGHT?
[52:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody the other day, we
[52:40] was talking about some individuals and
[52:42] individuals out there that we know at
[52:44] work. And I says, you know, one thing
[52:45] about it. I says, if you was in that
[52:47] person's position, that would be rock
[52:50] bottom for me. It would have been rock
[52:51] bottom, right? I says, "But what it is,
[52:54] everybody bottom ain't the same." Come
[52:57] on. They can have nothing
[53:00] and still walk around thinking that they
[53:02] don't talk to me. Don't tell me I I I
[53:04] got it all. You know what I'm saying?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE LIKE THAT, ain't there?
[53:09] &gt;&gt; CUZ EVERYBODY BOTTOM, BUT IT'S SOMETHING
[53:11] ABOUT IT. I SAID, "GOD, I'm so glad that
[53:13] you open my eyes and let me see."
[53:15] Hallelujah.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Right. When you think you hear, God say,
[53:19] "Hey, he show you." Right? But what it
[53:22] is, I SAYS ON THAT DAY, WE GOING WE
[53:24] GOING TO HAVE TO REALIZE what the value
[53:26] of it is, right? I was sharing with the
[53:28] children. This was some time ago now. I
[53:30] says, "Let me show you how all the you
[53:32] think you doing good, all the righteous
[53:33] and all that. So, let me show you what
[53:35] it's like." And I I I pretend like I
[53:38] took a a a rag and take it in the
[53:41] toilet, right? Wet it. It's nasty,
[53:45] right? Spray something on it. Smell real
[53:47] bad. This is what it's like, right? Come
[53:50] on. I said there's one thing you got to
[53:52] realize. You got to learn how to let go,
[53:55] right?
[53:56] &gt;&gt; And let God come on. It ain't what I can
[53:59] do, but it's what he's done for me.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's why I said John, he put
[54:03] all the attention on on on Christ,
[54:05] right? Come on. I'm not the one. NO, I'M
[54:08] NOT. NO, NO. HE SAYS, BUT HE IS. AND
[54:10] THAT'S why when I you see him say, "Hey,
[54:12] behold the lamb of God." Right there he
[54:15] is. That's who I'm trying to POINT YOU
[54:16] TO. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU
[54:18] RIGHT THERE. THAT IN THE END THAT'S the
[54:20] one you GONNA NEED, RIGHT? MAMA CAN'T
[54:22] STAND FOR YOU, DADDY, BROTHER, SISTER,
[54:24] COUSIN. I DON'T IT DON'T MATTER HOW
[54:26] GREAT OF A PERSON, WHATEVER THEY WERE.
[54:28] COME ON. YOU NEED THE LAMB. HALLELUJAH.
[54:30] YOU GOING TO HAVE TO KNOW HIM FOR
[54:32] YOURSELF. COME ON. AND ON THAT DAY,
[54:35] THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ONE YOU WANT TO
[54:36] SAY, COME ON, YOU STOOD for me.
[54:38] HALLELUJAH. COME ON. WELL DONE, MY GOOD
[54:41] AND FAITHFUL SERVANT. I can see those
[54:43] where Jesus is making the parable. He
[54:45] says, come says the the the one that
[54:47] says, "Haven't we done great works in
[54:49] your name?" He said, "Depart from me,
[54:51] you that work iniquity, I ain't never
[54:52] knew who you was." Come on. He says,
[54:55] "But the other one, he going to say,
[54:56] come on." IT SAYS, "WHEN I WAS SICK, YOU
[54:58] visited me." Hallelujah. When I was
[55:00] lonely, you come and comfort ME.
[55:02] HALLELUJAH. WHEN I WAS IN JAIL, you
[55:04] know, HE SAY, HE SAYS, THEY SAID, "LORD,
[55:06] WHEN WHEN DID WE DO THIS?" COME ON.
[55:08] BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T, THEY DIDN'T SEE
[55:09] THEMSELVES AS DOING IT, RIGHT?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; COME ON. THEY DIDN'T SEE THEMSELVES AS
[55:13] NOTHING. BUT HE SAYS WHEN YOU DID IT to
[55:15] the least of my brethren, hallelujah,
[55:16] you done it also unto ME. THAT'S WHAT
[55:18] IT'S ABOUT. HALLELUJAH. NOT GOING TO GOD
[55:21] SAYING WHAT I DONE OR OR WHAT YOU GOT
[55:23] SOME RIGHTS. ONLY RIGHTS YOU GOT IS THE
[55:25] ONES THAT GOD GAVE YOU ORDAINED FROM THE
[55:28] BEGINNING OF TIME. HALLELUJAH. And
[55:30] that's because he put your name there.
[55:31] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Somebody give God
[55:34] praise tonight. I SAID THE VALUE. Come
[55:37] on. The value. I was told somebody the
[55:39] other day. I said you know one thing. I
[55:42] said time gone. And I says one we
[55:44] looking at now as war look like boom
[55:48] pray. You know what's going on. We don't
[55:50] have to even talk about that tonight.
[55:52] But I says one thing about it. It's a
[55:54] praying time ain't it?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; I says you're going to realize one day
[55:58] that Jesus meant more than all
[56:01] everything else, didn't it? You know, I
[56:03] was listening to the monks the other day
[56:06] that's walking through. I said one thing
[56:08] about it. I listen to them a little bit.
[56:11] They weren't promoting Buddhism. look
[56:12] like, you know, for the most part. But
[56:15] he, one thing he was saying, one of the
[56:18] monks said, he said, he says, "A lot of
[56:20] us got partners at home, but we got
[56:22] lovers that we spend more time with." He
[56:25] said, "Physical." And then everybody's
[56:27] laughing. He said, "But I'm going to
[56:28] tell you something." He started breaking
[56:29] something down. He said like pretty much
[56:32] people at home. He said, "You got a
[56:33] partner at home." He says, "But you
[56:34] spend more time with your cell phone."
[56:37] Come on. He said, "You work all day
[56:39] long, then you at home on your cell
[56:41] phone more time than you spend with your
[56:43] your partner at home." Then he started
[56:45] talking about pretty much what I was
[56:46] saying. Well, he saying we got a lot of
[56:48] wasted time that don't mean nothing.
[56:51] Come on.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Lot of you do a lot of He said, "You he
[56:54] said a lot." He said, "You you spend
[56:55] more TIME WITH THIS THAN YOU DO WITH
[56:57] YOUR NATURAL PARTNER." Come on. And
[56:59] wonder why the communication broke down.
[57:01] WONDER WHY THIS COME ON. I I WAS
[57:03] LISTENING TO HIM. I SAID, "MAN, we ought
[57:04] to let him come preach at some of these
[57:06] churches."
[57:08] Cuz what he was saying was basic, BUT IT
[57:10] WAS REAL THOUGH, WASN'T IT? I SAID,
[57:12] "NOW, ALL THOSE THINGS THE M JUST
[57:14] TALKING ABOUT THE CELL PHONE, STUFF LIKE
[57:15] THAT." AND WHAT WE SAID DON'T MATTER. Do
[57:17] it in the end. What's going to matter?

[57:21] matter, right? COME ON. YOU YOU DON'T WE

[57:31] this?
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[57:34] &gt;&gt; Don't get mad with me now.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Is it the truth? I SAID, "GOD, CLEAN US
[57:39] UP."
[57:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; DID IT TAKE A MONTH TO tell us that?
[57:43] Come on. But it's the truth though,
[57:44] ain't it?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; I said, Lord, come on. We got to start
[57:48] like like they be saying you in the
[57:49] book, you got to start getting in the
[57:51] book, right? Get not only that, but

[58:03] BE SHUT THEN, RIGHT?" BUT COME ON, WHILE
[58:06] THE DOOR IS OPEN, WHILE GOD IS CALLING,

[1:01:25] ain't it? So many people out of work
[1:01:27] because they had tragedies around the
[1:01:29] holiday time."
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But I says, "How do we need God?"
[1:01:33] Hallelujah.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Every day we need him. Right?

[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I never forget I I want to be
[1:02:24] long tonight. I was telling the
[1:02:25] testimony about brother Gordon if you
[1:02:27] don't mind. I was telling them down in
[1:02:29] SA and uh I said brother Gordon remember
[1:02:33] that he he was saying that song.
[1:02:36] Remember that song bless me indeed.
[1:02:38] Bless me. Enlarge my territory. I
[1:02:41] remember brother Gordon saying that's
[1:02:42] one of the most selfish songs he ever
[1:02:44] heard.
[1:02:45] He says, "But then when I was laid off
[1:02:48] and they ain't had a job for what,
[1:02:49] almost two years or something, I
[1:02:51] remember him telling the testimony and
[1:02:53] he sung that song one Sunday morning was
[1:02:55] in the old building and I said the
[1:02:57] anointing came down and he said, "Lord,
[1:03:00] what it is, it ain't selfish. Lord, I
[1:03:02] need a blessing." Hallelujah.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Bless me indeed. Right?
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; I was sharing that with the church and
[1:03:08] something, but that's the truth. see
[1:03:09] what it is. I hope you don't mind,
[1:03:11] brother Gordon. But I said what it is
[1:03:14] when it's more than just see to me. I
[1:03:17] was telling them I'm going to sing me a
[1:03:18] song one Sunday
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; or one one night. It be might be a
[1:03:22] while.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; But I said long if you got to sing what
[1:03:27] you been through. Hallelujah.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Or what you dealing with. See, you just
[1:03:30] singing a song don't don't matter,
[1:03:32] right? But when you singing it from the
[1:03:34] heart because you said, "Lord, come on.
[1:03:37] Bless me indeed." Hallelujah. Enlarge my
[1:03:40] territory. Not because I'm just want to
[1:03:42] be greedy, but God, I need you to bless
[1:03:43] me. You promise that if I be faithful,
[1:03:46] God, that you'll bless me, Lord. Come
[1:03:48] on. You singing a song about healing,
[1:03:50] about deliverance, whatever it is. It's
[1:03:52] that that's that's where you at right
[1:03:53] now. Hallelujah. Come on. And you living
[1:03:55] the life. Not not you ain't living the
[1:03:57] life now, but you living the life,
[1:03:58] right? And you saying God and God said,
[1:04:00] "I would have blessed you the whole
[1:04:01] time, but you have not because you asked
[1:04:03] not. Now that you're asking, I'm going
[1:04:05] to bless you abundantly." Come on.
[1:04:07] exceedingly abundantly all that you can
[1:04:09] ask or think. Hallelujah.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. For he said, "What profit a man to
[1:04:36] gain the whole world and to lose his
[1:04:39] soul?"
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; But Jesus, Amen.
[1:04:43] He died
[1:04:45] that our souls could be saved.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; And that we could spend eternity with
[1:04:51] him.
[1:04:52] So he's very valuable to us that believe
[1:04:57] and has received
[1:05:00] eternal life.
[1:05:02] So we thank God for eternal life. I was
[1:05:06] just
[1:05:07] working on a sermon eating of the

[1:05:35] But those cherubims was blocking that
[1:05:37] tree. They're not blocking you from
[1:05:40] coming and eating.
[1:05:43] Jesus said, "I am the bread that came
[1:05:45] down from heaven. If a man eat thereof,
[1:05:48] he'll never die." What he said. Amen.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] He said, "I'm the water. If you drink
[1:05:54] it, you'll never thirst again."
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; So, by the grace of God, you can eat,
[1:06:02] you can drink.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you can live
[1:06:07] for eternity.

[1:06:26] you now.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; I need it." Amen. I need your spirit. I
[1:06:30] need your power. I need the life of God
