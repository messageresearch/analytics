[49:20] church it's getting ready to leave here
[49:22] we can't stay here on this earth much
[49:24] longer you said brother children i have
[49:25] been hearing that for a long time but
[49:27] that's all right the more you hear it
[49:29] the more it builds my uh uh uh build me
[49:32] to have me more encouraging the lord can
[49:35] the church say amen
[49:37] i just want to deal with amen
[49:40] uh amen the manifestation
[49:42] of the moon
[49:44] and the absence of the sun can you say
[49:47] amen
[49:48] you know the word the the
[49:51] the
[49:51] the moon
[49:53] uh give full strength in the absence of
[49:56] the sun
[49:57] can you say amen
[49:59] amen now
[50:01] i wrote here amen
[50:04] the sun and the moon in genesis 1 and
[50:07] 16.
[50:09] when god began to create the different
[50:12] planet god spoke
[50:14] and he had a thought first of all god
[50:17] had a thought
[50:18] god is just not someone that just speak
[50:20] things has hazardly amen so he know that
[50:24] he's god and he's he controlled
[50:26] everything so god spoke amen and the
[50:30] bible let us know and when god spoke
[50:33] that the bible let us know it was total
[50:35] darkness amen but everything was out a
[50:39] shape form avoid are you with me this
[50:41] morning amen i'm going to preach this
[50:43] morning i feel the presence of the lord
[50:45] y'all got to stay with me now but when
[50:47] god looked out there god said let there
[50:50] be and there was amen now first of all
[50:54] god had confidence in his word
[50:57] now you can't speak something and look
[50:59] for it to come to pass and you don't
[51:01] have confidence in it you say what you
[51:03] talking about brother children when you
[51:05] speak something you need to know that
[51:07] the mind of god
[51:09] somebody say man i give you for instance
[51:11] i don't want to leave off my thoughts
[51:13] amen but when moses went down to egypt
[51:16] egypt was a type of the world and this
[51:19] has never happened before moses said let
[51:22] there be flies
[51:24] flies never have come on the earth like
[51:26] that but what happened
[51:29] flies and fleas and frogs everywhere
[51:33] you know why because that was god
[51:36] thought
[51:37] that was god's mind when god spoke amen
[51:42] moses tapped into the very thought of
[51:44] god now what if moses would have said
[51:47] let there come fly
[51:49] and there wasn't no flies that wasn't
[51:52] god's thought
[51:53] so this morning the bride of jesus
[51:56] christ have to have the mind of god in
[52:00] this last in evil day can the church say
[52:03] amen i don't see my wife where's my wife

[1:12:20] it full
[1:12:22] strength
[1:12:24] are you hearing me

[1:12:31] it would be miserable
[1:12:32] i thank god for it the way he made
[1:12:35] everything
[1:12:36] how he made the planets
[1:12:38] and you know when you look at the moon i
[1:12:41] you know i've been looking at the moon
[1:12:43] way back in the days as a little boy i
[1:12:45] seen the moon look like it got them
[1:12:46] different spots on it and i was a little
[1:12:49] boy it looked like the moon face were
[1:12:50] changing and you know and and the
[1:12:53] prophet of god said what is what has
[1:12:55] happened what you see is the reflecting
[1:12:57] of that sun that's shining on that moon
[1:13:01] and causing it to look like mountains
[1:13:04] and things like that how many you think
[1:13:06] god
[1:13:07] amen the moon began to shine
[1:13:10] in the absence of the sun and what has
[1:13:12] happened is
[1:13:13] the sun
[1:13:15] is so large you know i just realized and
[1:13:17] i'm not ashamed to say i didn't realize
[1:13:20] how large how large the sun was to the
[1:13:24] earth how small the little earth is how
[1:13:27] do you know that i didn't realize that
[1:13:29] brother gordon i did i know there was a

[1:13:34] that huge
[1:13:38] it hangs out there and it give light and
[1:13:40] a little tiny little earth
[1:13:43] and god let that sun come over the earth
[1:13:46] and cause botany life cause things to
[1:13:49] grow how do you think god shine his
[1:13:52] light on you
[1:13:53] cause you to grow amen and one thing
[1:13:55] about the sun when it shines it burns up
[1:13:58] things also

[1:14:02] season of the of the weather it causes
[1:14:05] the grass to burn and just wither away
