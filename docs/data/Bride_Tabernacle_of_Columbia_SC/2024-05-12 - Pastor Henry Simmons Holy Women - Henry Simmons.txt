also May without the word be one by the conversation of the wife too who ad Dawning let it not be the outward awning of the platting of the hair or the wind of gold or the putting on of a par for for after this matter in the old time holy women women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection to their own husband together even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid of the god BL this word holy women we're living in a Time in a season that we're saying Mother's Day I had a it's sort of like a subtopic is Mother Nature Mother Nature so the subject this morning is Holy Women the nature of the mother the mother mother nature amen see because something about uh the nature that God gives a mother and when we talk about Mother Nature we are talking about let's just go to Romans one Romans one mother nature we're living in this last hour and the last days well holy women holy women it's a it's a scarce amount of people that women that are holy but to them that are holy thought about proverbs maybe I I let let me just maybe I come back to Romans let's just go to Proverbs somebody just prayed hard that I didn't do that Proverbs 3110 Proverbs 3110 holy women which is a a round Bunch almost in holy women and holy men and but we're not talking about men this morning we're talking about holy women are y'all all right everybody feel all right praise God God is good amen don't be sad this is time to Rejoice amen you're not glad brother Frank good to see you brother thank you Jesus God is good amen amen Proverbs when we talk about um the natural types the spiritual we're talking about holy women when you talk about holy you you you really think think about people that's Sanctified for God said be holy for I'm holy you're talking about a a person that has been set apart not like the rest of the women we're talking about holy women amen we're saying Mother's Day amen we realize that every everybody that has children is not a mother that's why I said we're talking about mother nature and when we talk about Mother's nature we're talking about not made by man the natural of the nature a natural you're not trying to make something that ain't there there so by the grace of God we talking about something that you don't have to uh work up on you know you got natural plants that natural trees and then you got artificial flowers are you with me something that amen look real but it ain't real are you with me so we have artificial Christians and we have real Christians we got people that claim to be a mother but the nature is not there I was coming to church this morning and as I was coming I listened to the radio and preacher was saying and I didn't know how it would fit he said that uh there was a man had raised uh I guess sheep and he had one that always somehow stray away from the rest of the sheep always getting in trouble and I mean just getting just just won't stay with the rest of the flock and just always uh giving a whole lot of problem so he said he built a little thing to put him in and he put put him in there somehow the way he digged out and and get out of that so no kind of way he could keep the the sheep in the in the fold just give trouble all the time but he say something happened to that sheep some of y'all know the story said the Sheep got pregnant and when the Sheep got pregnant you know it probably had to hold up a little while but when she had the what you call the Sheep they had Lambs or what he didn't say that but we had a baby or whatever and uh but after that after having the CH the baby still couldn't keep the Sheep still running all on still going all about wow guess what happened he said the man couldn't handle the sheep and the Sheep wouldn't make a good mother got what he decided to do kill it she even e it so he said it just won't make no mother and it's a bag on the rest of them see what I'm saying now we have many stories but if we talking about holy women talking about a mother a mother that here says here in uh Proverbs 31-10 said who can find a what for her price is what oh Lord have mercy you know I'm going tell you so the Bible say whosoever finded a wife finded a what good thing but it it's special to those of whom I'm speaking of holy women those that virtuous women for her price tell you Brothers young men I got two sons but whoever find it a what whoever find it a why find a good thing but he I want you to know find it a virtuous a virtuous woman her price it's far above rubies are you with me uh a virtuous holy women holy women you ain't got no problem you you you you you can you can put your trust in her this this what he says her price is for brother ruin and I I just realized that amen the the the price of somebody amen uh I mean it's some folk you can give all you want but a holy woman a virtuous woman amen you can't uh you can't it's hard to find it's difficult when you find somebody's virtues holy women you know when it's talks about holy women it talks about amen Women of Faith and it it it it even in Hebrews it talks about Rahab which was a hollow but God talks about her amen a as being in the faith Hall of Fame God didn't look at her path and holding Helen against us I believe she would be style as one of those holy women somebody said I remember RAB I remember she was a h but God talked about amen Rahab the har in the Hall of Fame who can find a virtuous woman God can change your whole life amen God can turn you all around amen amen hallelujah amen to be classified and identified amen as one of God's holy women amen how would you like for God to look at you amen when I talk about this morning a virtuous woman who can find one like that praise God you mothers that I'm going tell you something when I think about holy women I think about praying with me I look at my mom and I I said we miss her and I think I was sitting out with one of my aunts on my uh daddy's side and and she said to me he said your your Grandmama was a Praying Grandmama on my daddy's side then on my mama's side I my aunt sat down and she talked about your Grandmama she was stressing I said oh goodness it's going on down the line on Daddy's side on Mama's side out of the sisters or whatever they talked about Grandmama on both sides was praying so we're here because amen not only Mama Prayed but Grandmama prayed amen holy women amen amen so so when we look back at our it's people that stood in the C before you ever got here amen amen that God amen with all of their PR am amen and I thank God I I I I you know I just thank God I a look good here you know I I thought oh I hear Aunt on Daddy's side aunt on Mama side they I mean they were giving honor to those how would you like that to happen amen the people can look at you amen and they can honor you from being a holy woman see I know sometime you know that's one of the greatest Honors that anybody can give you to call you that's a holy woman but sometimes people don't want ah don't don't call me holy I don't want to be but you know young young sisters they said that uh age women teach to young women how to love their husband amen I'm talking about Mother's Day I'm talking about real mothers teach you how to love your husband amen we don't have to have a missionary boy to do that we don't have to have special occasion to do that just train up a child the way they should go you know I asked the question in the in the Sunday school or in the Bible study I said who was Unice and Lis holy women they were the one that was giv credit from teaching Timothy the scriptures that was mama and Grandmama that taught Timothy Paul amen didn't have to teach timoth to the scriptures because uh Lois and Unice had already did it thank God for Lois Lois and Unis had taught timy to the scripture holy women teaches the children the wi teach them how to conduct their lives that they might not end up in trouble in life they have somewhere to turn they have somebody they can lean on somebody they can pin on Amen that they can look to the Lord amen in the time of their distress and in the time of their trouble because my taught us how to pray amen amen praise God my prayed Somebody Prayed For Me amen had me on their mind took the time and prayed for me am and I'm so glad they prayed amen amen I'm glad they prayed for me amen praise God hallelujah and I'm going to tell you something if we can we are beneficial from amen mama and Grandmama godly people that took the time to pray for us cuz I wasn't good all the time didn't do the right thing didn't live the right kind of way but it's something about knowing that somebody was standing in the gap for you I'm going to tell you something about a holy woman it said the heart of her husband does safely what trust her you ain't got to worry about coming home worry about was or not she going to have a some food oh I guess that's old style religion that's old style religion you know we got the new religion but that's all right amen a husband safely trust her are you with me oh you you telling us about the old time stuff H you want something to eat you better go buy some ordered from McDonald's or whatever are you with me it's nothing wrong with it holy women amen nothing wrong with it the husband safely trusted in her a't that right ain't that all right the husband can trust you oh I don't know whether I can trust her or not a Godly woman you ain't worried about her amen a Godly woman somebody say you know fell talking to your wife I me talk all you want oh you worried about no I ain't worried about it if he FLIR with her she can take care of herself are you with me that man a she know how to do it amen you trust her she can handle herself amen I'm I'm check out no no don't talk to my wife don't get up my wife face no you can safely trust her you know if you don't trust her don't marry her amen but a holy woman you can trust why because the Holy Ghost is in her that's what makes her a holy woman she's filled with the spirit husband can trust her without the Holy Ghost we can't trust him amen but with the Holy Ghost you can put your trust in her amen I'm so glad for Holy Women amen praise God hallelujah what makes us holy because it's the holy spirit that makes the difference in her than the rest of the women holy women a mama that filled with the spirit makes a difference a mother that loves the LA and then put God first makes the difference amen praise God Brothers if you're looking for a wife amen get holy woman amen make sure she wants to be holy make sure that she has the spirit make sure that she'll make a good mother it talks about a certain man was buying cows or whatever and praise God Amen I think one went out the other one come in man had cows praise God and uh he was buying cows and he looked in he went up to the cow and he was looking in the face of the cow looking at and ask the question why you looking at that cow like that he said staring at the Cow he said you see that cow look at his eyes look at her eyes is she got those wild stares and wild eyes say she'll never you don't want that one because she'll never make a mother are you with me because you know and that's what happens who can find a virtuous woman somebody that can ra your children somebody amen

God for Holy sister this morning I I said Happy Mother's Day thank God for sisters that amen was willing to give their life to Jesus and live for God Amen amen who can find a virtuous woman on another occasion it tell me about men was out hunting and certain man had a certain little instrument that he could call and make it look like he's whistle can blow like a a baby deer that's in trouble so they were hunting deers and the man [Music] would beep beep and the mother deer heard looked like the baby was in trouble and they were out hunting and they waited for that deer to come out in the open and that mother could not resist coming to look for that because in her was a mother and Instinct began to pull her to see about that baby crying and the hunter that didn't believe in God was getting ready to blow the deer hard out but guess what happened instead of doing that he saw God in that and he couldn't do it because he saw the nature of of a mother and he said even though he had created an instrument that he could call the deer out but he saw he saw something that was original the love that the that deer had for a baby that's in trouble praise God somebody said the prophet nobody could actually intercede amen like a mother can for her child a mother love is something that a man just can't founding a have like that a mother amen she has that attachment praise God because
