we're going to the word of the Lord amen thank the Lord for you in Jesus Christ's name let's go to the Book of Mark the 8th chapter Mark 8 and 35-37 and we go to Matthew 16 you got to say amen amen praise the Lord let us read for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels to say shall save it for what shall it profit a man or a woman Bo a girl he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul what it going to profit you let's go to the Book of Matthew Matthew 16 these two passages of scriptures are saying the same thing and I read I'm reading both passages in order to let it be firmly settled on your mind the Bible said they there be established in the mouth of two or more witnesses that's right so we want to get this firmly established in your mind Matthew 16 and 24 then said Jesus un his disciples If any man come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me whoever sh will save his life shall lose it whoever lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited the Bible say what shall luk Mark said what shall a profit a man Matthew said what does a man profited if he shall gain the whole world everything you desire that you want that you've been dreaming of you got all of that but remember it's a cost to go with it what shall a profit a man he gain the whole world and lose his soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul amen let us pray gracious kind Heavenly Father once again we thank you for allowing us to be here this morning Lord for the pastor Lord you put upon his heart to invite us here to minister your word pray you bless him Lord in his absence him and his family I pray God you just bless your people that come out this morning to hear your word but something is said to give them Grace and strength in the days we living in when we commit this service inside your hands we ask you to have your way in Jesus Christ's name amen may be seated we want to just take a a topic from that the big gamble the big gamble we living in an age where gambling is prevalent it's all over the place everything now it's about gambling they make it so easy the people to G gamble now young people old people people gamble all the time and we know what today is people come to church but the Mind probably is on Super Bowl Sunday and a lot of people have gambled today they wagered on this game and other parts of this game they have gambled because it's so easy now to gamble a lot of people gamble and they don't know when you you gamble you are going to lose am you can't win by gambling we going to read some things to you by the grace of God but want to establish in your mind is the age of gambling they on to advertisement they advertising for you to gamble they make it so convenient now they even put the apps on your telephone that you can gamble by your telephone making bets on just about anything now you can just gamble anything you can gamble you can gamble how much time the gambling on Taylor Swift now how many times you can do this or that you can gamble how many times some going to catch the football how many times so going to make it so you going to gamble by anything that make it so easy for the gamble here but here we talking about now the biggest gamble you can gamble with is your soul see a lot of people gamble and don't know they gambling so gambling is out there and people gamble every day making decisions that not knowing that there's a price to pay I'm coming from that see so gambling is prevalent you said brother I don't gamble a lot of people gamble I hope Christians don't do it but people do gamble even people that go to church they gamble amen praise God we know they they gamble out there and um Christians shouldn't do it if you're a Christian you do not gamble Christians don't gamble they don't they don't play Lottery church people do though a lot of religious people go to church and they you seem you know they go to church and they'll stop out or the store the gas station and they right before you taking their time trying to buy a lottery ticket scratching and everything gam no they shouldn't do it but they do it anyway why because they just church goers I'm trying to not trying to knock people down nothing like that but real Christians don't gamble we don't believe in taking chances I'm not taking a chance with My Soul it's too pressure my soul I want my soul to be secure and it is secure L I stay in Christ see we don't take chances we don't do games of chance we don't don't play lotteries we don't play Raffles yes amen all that is Chance taking a chance they want you to buy a raffle ticket don't you know if you buy a raffle ticket you taking a chance you just gam you said I'm trying to be nice well I give you a donation but I don't gamble amen don't take chances why because you going to lose amen they tell you what the odds are you will not win but you took the chance anyway you say I'm being ni but Christians don't gamble why don't Christian gamble because we have an absolute we have an absolute so we don't need to gamble cuz our absolute itself take care everything we have need of Amen yes I Absolut see we got an absolute but everything we do in life as a Christian now I'm not talking about people that go to church and they haven't fully given their life to God and that's why they do the things they do that way they can still Gamble and play Lottery have raffle tickets play Bingo for money and stuff like that they so they gambling but a real true Christian amen they have an absolute and everything they do they're sure they're sure about why because they're basing it on the word of God something that can't fail see everything we do is based on what the word our absolute is the word of God and everything we do is supposed to be based on that word can I say y'all say amen amen everything we do as Christians now you're not supposed to do anything unless you pray to God about it how many y'all can agree with that amen how you're not supposed to do anything unless you seek the Lord first why cuz he's your absolute that why we don't take chance with anything even this a job you a chrisan you praying Lord should I take this job Lord should I do this Lord why because we have an absolute our absolute leads us guides us tell us which way to go and what to do it supplies everything thing we have need of our absolute the absolute is the word our absolute is the what the word of God Amen that's our absolute it's perfect in itself it's complete and it can't fail am I wrote down some scriptures here about an absolute I got wrote down a definition here on the back amen it says uh H it's free from imperfections amen no flaws in it God ain't got no flaws how many got God ain't got no flaws amen uh uh uh say I find no fault in the man that's right but I find no fault see no no imperfection and it's complete it don't need nothing else all absolute see and also it's perfect amen it's that's God isn't that God no imperfections it's complete and it's perfect that's God that's the that's the word to us that what God is he's are absolute were Christians they're settled they don't go around from place to place and run from here to there KN they settled because they settled upon their absolute and that absolute is the word of God we are settled on the word amen it has are settled we don't have to run from here to Yonder do all the here we are settled because we are on our absolute the absolute is the word of God all as the word of God Be Your absolute you have nothing to worry about you got to take chances you got to gamble you got to take chance when I I'm I'm going play the lottery I'm I'm going to buy me a lottery ticket I'm going see if I can win somebody know you're going to lose you're going to lose amen amen the devil got a set up for you to lose espe you know you're a Christian he got a set up for people that play their Christian to lose every time you're not going to win he going to make sure you lose he going to take your money your money you're hard working money you work hard for that your family need for food for clothes and whatever else the devil will trick you to take that money and gamble with with it did you know a lot of people going to take their hard earned money today and gamble with it they going to bet on that game some going pay take their light bill money some going to take their bill money some going to take the money the chilling in they going to gamble they're going to take a chance on something they're not even sure they don't even know the come out of a deck the devil going to have them gambling they spend all they money in their time hoping and praying now that they team win and they team might lose where your money going then all that money you took and gambled on the game some of you probably gambled on it this morning you done place your bet hoping it's going to come out right hoping your team going to win but see the devil man has to reive you cuz he's the first one to gamble did you know the devil's the first one to ever gamble yeah he was the first one to gamble because he thought he could beat God he gambled the devil gambled yes he did he's a he's the first one to gamble he's the first one to do everything wrong the first one to tell a lie first one to everything first is on the devil he gamble that he can beat God it came into his mind that I want I want to be God I want to be God so he he got a plan in his mind that I'mma take over God's kingdom I'mma take over over what God has established because I believe I can do it so he gambled and guess what he lost he lost his gamble he lost his Bard he thought he could do it but he got kicked out of heaven all the angels with him those that believed his lies so the devil's crafty and smooth you know I thought about that had been a real powerful lie uh we were persuasive lie the devil to tell those angels to make them go with him to overthrow God think about it now these angels that live in heaven have been up there with God and the devil got in his mind that he can take God on he can beat God I'mma I'mma take over I'm I'mma take it all and he persuaded angels to come after him all had been a pretty persuasive lie you know pretty powerful persuasive lie for angels to leave their place and join up with a devil the de wasn't always a devil he was Lucifer the son of the morning that's right amen uh the the anointed cheriff that coverthe his place in heaven but remember when people start lifting you up and boasting you up you better be careful to trying to get you out your place amen that what happened to Lucifer the Bible say he can sing he had instrument can sing and can play he was bright and he got to his head and he began to get lift it up and say you know what I can I can be like God I I can take God's place and he did he tried it and he lost he gambled why would you gamble like that take a risk that you can beat the almighty God Amen the one that created him the one that made him he thought that he can beat God and God didn't even come down God sent us he sent one of his most Mighty Angels Michael amen the Archangel came and defeated Satan kick them out of Heaven let's read some scriptures here by the grace of God let's go to Ezekiel 28 now the devil's the first want to gamble now that why people got that gambling Spirit on them today they're not really saved but that Spirit come from Satan to gamble to take a chance see you taking a chance with your soul the dev that's the biggest gamble the dev want you to do is take a chance with your soul he wants you to put off salvation as long as he can make you think that you got time not to make that decision to give your life to Christ he he make you think you got plenty of time amen he make you think in that mind I'm I'm too young I haven't got everything I I want in life yeah and he make you think that okay I got time but time is not on your side time is not on nobody's side the day when you hear his voice hard not your heart the day the Lord come knocking you need to make a decision that I'm going to serve the Lord see cuz time is not on your side amen yes amen you don't know when your name going to be called you don't know when you're going to leave this place called Earth you don't know when you going to leave but one day your name will be called amen amen well we pray God that you made the right decision you didn't gamble you didn't wait too long that when they they stand over you and put them in that grave you know what we we tried to get them to serve the Lord we tried to get them to get saved but they wouldn't do it many have said those words we tried to get them to serve the Lord but they would just kept on doing the same old thing they've been doing don't let them word be said over you see while the Lord is knocking what the Lord is calling don't gamble give yourself to the Lord amen serve the Lord in your youth why you got a chance amen amen so the devil amen Ezekiel 28 so the devil he knows about all this thing being in heaven amen he took a gamble he gambled now you say brother how can you say get that out of that cuz that's what he did he gambled that he can beat God and he lost he lost everything lost his position everything lost he lost it all on a gamble see people going to lose it all the day on a gamble lose it all the day because of a game what that game got to do with you whatever they doing out there then people don't know you they don't even know you whoever you is they don't know you I'm they a't thinking about you but they have will gamble on these people just to try to make some money trying to bring income in their pocket don't you know the most dangerous thing you can do is take a gamble you lose that way you don't gam that why we we say you stick with your absolute that's the word amen stick with your absolute because the absolute is complete in itself and it got everything you need and side of it if you just stick with it you got everything that why we don't do the things that the world do good we got an absolute absolute said I'll supply all your needs yes amen that's our absolute amen that we don't play G as a chance we relying on our absolute amen it promise it will do it I'm resting on it in Jesus Christ's name and I have to play a lottery I don't have to uh go gamble or anything I going to play Bingo whatever the people do I buy raffle tickets to win a TV to go on a trip wherever they raffle they raffle off anything now they can think of y'all know we telling the truth they ra off anything they can think of to get you to buy a raffle ticket and you Christian why you buying that raffle ticket for you scared of telling people you don't gamble tell them you don't I don't take chance I don't I don't play games a chance I'm a Christian I will give you donation if you like have a donation but I won't go buy I'm not can buy your raffle ticket why I don't gamble amen my God supplies all my needs amen he's applies every one of them he Ain fail yet see he's applies every one of my needs I so I resting on my absolute amen it ain't fill me yet but I'm Ezekiel 28 praise the Lord I'm resting on my absolute amen amen praise God it done exactly what it has said so I don't have to worry about what other things people are doing morning going on around me amen CU my absolute is sure amen praise the Lord it is sure it's it don't waver it stays the same yesterday and today and forever amen it it's the same it never change what it did back in y to days it can do the same thing today why it's an absolute praise the Lord that what Christians rest on Amen we don't uh take chances we don't do nothing by chance amen praise the Lord amen Ezekiel 28 tell you a little bit not me the holy spirit let us know who who Satan was the whole the word of God reveals who Satan is and what he was and what he had and what he did the word of God reveals them out to us see so you an know anything by Satan you look in the word the word of God will tell you exactly all about him notice look at the third verse behold thou are wiser than Daniel there's no secret that they can hide from the so the devil's is craft he's a wise old bird the prophet he a wise old bird why he been here a long time so he knows exactly how to scheme you though you don't recognize it I know a lot of young people that they're smarter than the devil but the devil's way smarter than you he way smarter then all of us sitting here together the only thing we got to defeat him is the word of God you can't defeat the devil on on intellectual knowledge how smart you is he'll beat you every time only way defeat him is you got to steal with your absolute that's the word of God y'all hear that young people you cannot all smart him he's too smart he's wiser than Daniel and Daniel was Wise by the Holy Spirit that's right so you can't out Fe out defeat him like that it man you got to rest on the word all right let's going to down now by the grace of God 13th verse th has been an Eden the Garden of God every precious storm of thy covering the sworders the torped and the diamond the Barrel the onx and the Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the Caron and the gold and the workmanship of thy taets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created no just he can he can sing he the Bible say he's the anointed cheriff so the devil can sing so you want no Marvel all these religious people they can sing and live like the devil in no Marvel ain't no marel they can sing like angels and live like devils ain't no Marvel see cu the devil can sing but he can't keep the word see there ain't no Marvel and all people out there are anointed to and they can sing but it can't live right see that's the thing with you're singing have some living with it keep live what you're singing though th anointed cherub that cover it I have set the so th upon the holy mountain of God that walk up and down the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect and all in thy way from the de th was created till what iniquity was found in thee he was perfect God made him but something was in his heart he got puffed up lifted up because of his Beauty because of his gifts and it come into his heart I can be like God not only can I be like God I can be God I can take over this thing then he tell Jesus all this will I give the thou would do what Fall Down and Worship me he told Jesus just worship me see so de the devil wants to be worshiped he wants to take the place of God that's what his whole game plan is still today he still have though he was cast out of heaven and though he has been defeated by God his plan still today is to be worshiped as God he has not changed his plan he not changed what he purposed to do he's still on that same path though he's already been defeated did y'all hear that he been kicked out of heaven he been cast down to the Earth but he's still doing the same thing knowing he's been defeated by God God defeated him God sent Michael the Archangel amen cast him out of Heaven not Gods he battle but against God but God used one of his chief angels to defeat him Michael the Archangel amen Michael gonna stand up once again in the last days Michael shall stand up the Archangel going to stand up just he did back then then he going to do it again he going to stand up in the last days Amen to defeat the enemy once again praise the Lord let's move on by the grace of God let's go to Revelation let's go to Isaiah first Isaiah 14 amen so the devil amen he not lost his ambition what he purposed to do the Bible says in Revelation the 13th chapter that all the world shall wander after the Beast and worship him he's going to accomplish that which he purposed to do but guess what we won't be here we Christians we be gone in the rapture we won't be among them that could be worshiping the devil Amen on the last days God has made a way for us to get out of here see everybody left behind they going be worshiping think they worshiping God but they're going to be worshiping the devil see he had not lost his ambition he not lost what he purposed to do he's still on the same path though he's been defeated by God see Isaiah 14 he is not lost

cursed thing for Aon the son of Cari the son of zabot the son of Zer the tribe of Judah took up their cursed thing and the Lord's anger was kindled against the children of Israel and now they begin to lose the battle but God done told them all the battles they going to win every battle amen sixth verse and Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the Earth upon his feet for the Ark of the Lord until the even tide he and the Elders of Israel put dust upon the head because they're not supposed to be losing you're not supposed to lose either long as you stand in the word of God and Joshua said El Li oh Lord God wherefore th and all those brought all those people with Jordan to deliver to the hand of the amorites to destroy us would the God we have been content and dwell on outside of Jordan oh Lord what shall I say when Israel turth his back before the enemies 10 verse and the Lord said to Joshua get up wherefore L thou thus upon thy face Israel has sinned they have also committed also trespass by Covenant which I commanded them with even taken up their cursed thing and have also stolen and disassembled also and they put it even among their own stuff see the uh one man can cause the death of many people he took a gamble he lost he lost 20th verse and a could answered Joshua said I indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel and thus and thus have I done when I saw a mountain the SPs a goodly Babylonia garment and 200 shekels of silver and a wage of gold of 50 shkel weight I covered them and took them and behold they hidden the Earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it all the Babylonian clothes people wear today you don't need them kind of clothes you need Christian clothes come on somebody the Babylonian garment the 200 shekel of silver and the wage of gold all that stuff look good but they ain't going to profit you nothing in the end man he took an a hit him in his tents Joshua sent messeng the get know this this this a part right here we want to want to get to you the 25th verse but let's look at the 24th verse and Joshua and all Israel with them took Ain the son of Zer and the silver and the garments and the wage of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and brought them un the valley of eor one man greed caused the destruction of his whole family he gambled didn't he
