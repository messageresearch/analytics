[38:04] [Music]
[38:05] amen tonight if your Bibles The Book of
[38:11] [Music]
[38:19] Matthew
[38:21] 22 I believe yes Matthew 22
[38:43] before before brother Nathan had went to
[38:46] the hospital we was kind of doing a
[38:49] little series
[38:52] upon the very area that he had upon his
[38:56] heart and
[38:59] so we want to just try to share a little
[39:01] bit of those those that Amen in Jesus
[39:04] Christ's
[39:05] name Matthew
[39:11] 22 let's start at verse 26 excuse me
[39:16] 36 22 and
[39:23] 36 here we have the Pharisees then one
[39:26] of the lawyer coming asking Jesus for a
[39:29] questing tempting him and he said
[39:32] [Music]
[39:33] Master which is the great commandment in
[39:37] the
[39:38] law Jesus said unto him thou shallal
[39:42] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[39:47] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[39:51] mind this is the first and great
[39:55] commandment
[39:58] amen and the second is like until it
[40:02] thou shallal love thy neighbor as
[40:06] thyself on these two
[40:10] Commandments hang all the law and the
[40:15] prophets father bless th word Lord
[40:19] sanctify it Quicken it in Jesus name
[40:23] amen be seated
[40:36] here this
[40:39] lawyer you notice the religious people
[40:42] always brought Jesus questing just to
[40:45] see his
[40:47] respond tempting him in other words
[40:50] trying to
[40:51] bring some type of false
[40:55] acquisition against against his
[40:59] teaching but if you notice he stayed
[41:02] right in the
[41:05] scripture that's it
[41:08] amen here and I believe even so today
[41:13] there the question
[41:17] sometimes you know with us as we call
[41:20] ourselves message
[41:24] Believers no doubt if Jesus was actually
[41:27] is question what is the great
[41:30] commandment
[41:33] today seeing we have the open revelation
[41:38] of the
[41:40] word that God had brought to his people
[41:43] in this
[41:45] hour made known the Mysteries and
[41:49] reveal all the hidden things that were
[41:54] laying there in the Bible but no one
[41:58] could exactly put it in the right
[42:02] place and God by his Sovereign Grace his
[42:07] Mercy ordained that in the last days
[42:11] that he would sent us in
[42:17] Elijah that's going to expound
[42:21] and uh his ministry was going to be a
[42:25] Ministry the for on the second coming of
[42:30] Christ but more than
[42:33] that in his very life we saw the very
[42:38] expression of the love of
[42:44] God and that love that he showed because
[42:48] that was the same thing Jesus
[42:52] showed I believe the Bible say there
[42:54] that for God so loved the the
[42:58] world that he
[43:00] gave his only begotten son what did it
[43:05] it was the love of
[43:08] God the love constrained him to laid
[43:13] down his
[43:18] life something that had never ever had
[43:22] tooken Place taken place before
[43:27] that a man lay down his life for his
[43:33] friends I'm understanding and now I'm
[43:36] seeing plainly that if the people ever
[43:40] can receive that love of God in their
[43:47] hearts I believe all the isms and things
[43:51] will just fade away amen true
[43:55] amen but it has to be the real love of
[44:01] God Jesus said if you love
[44:04] [Music]
[44:05] me he didn't say
[44:12] shout he didn't say use the gifts but if
[44:15] you love me he said keep my what
[44:20] Commandments in other words keep my
[44:25] word this is shown that this love of God
[44:29] that I'm going be talking about tonight
[44:31] can only be expressed expressed through
[44:34] the Holy
[44:38] Ghost you don't know how to love right
[44:40] until you have been born
[44:42] again come on now amen you know how to
[44:46] love fleshly
[44:49] amen and that love sometime gets
[44:54] sour it fades away you turn it off off
[44:57] and you turn it
[45:00] on but it's not really a love it more of
[45:06] affection that love is
[45:11] cruel it's really is really not even
[45:17] real especially as we see it today that
[45:21] that word is used so much lightly a lot
[45:26] of times to be
[45:32] deceptive mostly every young man know
[45:35] that if a young girl ever get told she
[45:38] love them she just her heart just
[45:45] fluttered everybody wants to be
[45:47] [Music]
[45:49] loved but love is something you can't
[45:52] buy amen
[45:54] amen so many people tried to buy
[45:59] it and when it's bought it can be sold
[46:06] am but God paid a
[46:10] price that nobody else could ever pay am
[46:17] and he didn't do it
[46:20] selfishly he didn't do it for any kind
[46:22] of glorification to uh to get some great
[46:26] honor
[46:27] but he did this because he loved
[46:34] us I thought about that so there's no
[46:36] greater
[46:42] love
[46:45] God be the Ser of God say Jesus was God
[46:49] love
[46:52] token he came to
[46:55] express that that
[46:59] love that God had for us
[47:03] am so many time I use the thought I say
[47:06] a lot of times people look for love all
[47:09] in the wrong
[47:12] places what we call cute and what we
[47:15] call this and God said that's
[47:20] foolishness cuz see real love won't do
[47:23] anything to harm you amen amen amen amen
[47:28] young sisters young Brothers when you
[47:31] ever hear that word about I love you it
[47:33] won't do nothing to harm you or to mess
[47:37] you up to take advantage of you amen
[47:42] amen real love won't do
[47:49] that Serv God said love is the greatest
[47:53] Force there ever is real love
[47:57] he said nothing can take the place of
[48:02] that so if you're looking for
[48:05] love call on Jesus amen
[48:09] amen he knows how to love
[48:13] you I thought about that woman in the in
[48:16] the Bible the woman at the well that had
[48:18] the five husband and she was with the
[48:21] sixth man she was looking for
[48:24] love that's why she married married five
[48:30] times she was looking for it all in the
[48:33] wrong
[48:36] places so because of her understanding
[48:40] of love she thought that hey maybe this
[48:43] is the
[48:45] one but look what she went through to
[48:48] try to get to the point five marriages
[48:51] and then decide to live with the Sixth
[48:54] Man
[48:57] so when she met Jesus at that well she
[49:01] said here's another
[49:05] man but this man did not come looking
[49:08] for anything from her he came to give
[49:11] her something amen amen amen amen and
[49:15] that's what Jesus even doing today he's
[49:18] coming to give you
[49:21] something something that can hold you
[49:24] and can keep you even when you you can't
[49:27] keep your own
[49:29] self when you weak he gets
[49:35] stronger
[49:37] amen I believe the bible say that God is
[49:40] able to keep that which you commit to
[49:42] him amen amen and when you fre commit
[49:47] yourself to God God will keep you young
[49:51] people
[49:53] amen so many times that's what the times
[49:57] that guess the young
[50:00] people you know run to the
[50:04] world because they're looking for
[50:07] love they want somebody just to be able
[50:10] to show them some kind of affection that
[50:15] they you love
[50:18] me but then because they don't fully
[50:22] understand the real meaning of
[50:24] it and what this world done with that
[50:28] word
[50:30] love made it more of a
[50:34] commercial feeling you have for someone
[50:38] that you are physically attractive
[50:42] to but there is no Beauty to be desired
[50:46] in
[50:49] him oh my and what God has for
[50:52] you young and old people nobody on this
[50:55] Earth can ever
[50:57] give you the things that God can give
[50:58] you amen every one of us want life we
[51:02] want a more prosperous and blessed life
[51:05] if you want that seek God amen
[51:09] amen the great commandment we call
[51:15] it no doubt if
[51:17] we our little terminologist when it
[51:21] comes to the things of the word and uh
[51:24] the message of the hour especially we
[51:27] ceriz what we call
[51:29] Great the opening of the seals and the
[51:33] Thunders and all of those things but no
[51:38] all those things must be governed by
[51:41] love if love is not the
[51:45] center because God is love
[51:51] amen and love that is not puffed up
[51:56] love is kind it's
[52:01] longsuffering and love is not partial
[52:06] go let me go to another
[52:10] scripture
[52:14] Matthew
[52:17] five we talking to brother Nathan and I
[52:19] was just sitting listening to him I
[52:22] didn't even interrupt
[52:24] him what he was saying I just want
[52:26] wanted to get more on what he was saying
[52:28] cuz I know that Lord had already had me
[52:30] to start dealing with this at the church
[52:34] Maran trying to get the people to real
[52:38] genuine love of God in their hearts amen
[52:42] cuz see it has to get in the people's
[52:46] heart and only through the Holy
[52:52] Ghost love will cover a multitude to of
[52:59] sins not that we pity sin but love
[53:02] covers
[53:04] it that's what Jesus did for everyone
[53:07] here tonight
[53:09] amen in the Old Testament you know they
[53:12] never could get rid of their sins they
[53:15] it was only covered up through the
[53:17] animals and you know the sheeps and
[53:19] things of that nature only a type but
[53:22] when Jesus
[53:24] came he didn't come to cover up amen
[53:27] come on now he come
[53:30] to take it away
[53:35] amen no more yearly sacrifice once and
[53:39] for
[53:40] all he settled the sin
[53:45] problem what did it it was the love of
[53:48] God that he had for us
[53:55] amen lot time people want something deep
[53:58] brother when I saw that this is
[54:03] deep cuz it's something can't be
[54:05] imitated amen amen come on now amen you
[54:09] know when it's real love amen
[54:13] amen in the natural when a young man and
[54:16] young woman get attracted to one another
[54:19] you know they may have never even
[54:21] known I ain't going to use I thought
[54:23] about brother
[54:25] Mack love at first
[54:28] sight it wasn't no
[54:32] question and is
[54:35] proof after all these
[54:38] years he's still right
[54:42] there see love binds you
[54:49] together it's not so much of a physical
[54:51] attraction young people please get that
[54:54] out of your head
[54:56] don't little pretty eyes and pretty hair
[54:58] and all of that pretty stuff going to be
[55:03] gone and when you look over there it
[55:06] better be
[55:10] love lover cause you to go through
[55:15] things together

[55:37] too frustrated I'm
[55:42] gone but real love you understand that
[55:46] the vows that you took was before God to
[55:53] death now PA One play what shall
[55:56] separate us from the love of
[56:01] God
[56:03] disagreements
[56:06] money this and that no no no Paul saying
[56:09] all these things we are more than
[56:12] conquerors through Christ that loved
[56:17] us oh
[56:20] my that real love really knits you I'm
[56:24] talking about your love for God tonight
[56:27] tonight I believe I heard the servant of
[56:29] God say if I don't have one gift in the
[56:31] church just let love be in the church
[56:34] amen amen amen love will produce gifts
[56:38] he said love will cause a miracle to
[56:42] happen he said love cast out
[56:48] Devils I understand that before you can
[56:51] help people in this hour they got to
[56:53] know you care about them that you love
[56:56] them them not love the church and love
[56:58] the rules and love this no no love them
[57:02] amen amen amen and that mean loving them
[57:05] in spite of whatever situation they may
[57:09] be in you can let them know that the
[57:12] love of God still is able to take you
[57:15] out of that situation amen
[57:22] amen oh
[57:24] my what we need in our churches what we
[57:27] need around this great M of the hour is
[57:29] the love of
[57:31] God but we are so focus upon
[57:35] the
[57:37] quotations and the Deep things they we
[57:40] call it deep the high you
[57:43] know uh but I I understand that Jesus
[57:45] said it's the little
[57:48] foxes that spoil of f not not the great
[57:52] thing we we can pretty much well
[57:53] remember that but we can't produce that
[57:56] love of God in our hearts see can that
[57:59] come through the Holy
[58:02] Ghost and a lot of time what is the real
[58:04] problem is the people have not been born
[58:07] again
[58:09] yet you can't tell me Holy Ghost Born

[1:00:13] remember that when we had Church plus 7
[1:00:16] time did not
[1:00:19] matter why because the people were in
[1:00:21] love with God school work didn't care
[1:00:26] why because their love was so real for
[1:00:29] God they were stirred about God and God
[1:00:33] came down and met needs and Pillar of
[1:00:36] Fire the
[1:00:38] supernatural because the people love
[1:00:41] God if only we can get the people back
[1:00:45] to that kind of frame of mind that well
[1:00:47] they not worried about
[1:00:49] work and making money but they concerned

[1:05:36] ungodliness
[1:05:40] amen we love people because of material
[1:05:46] things Matthew 5 I'm closing
[1:06:01] 43 through
[1:06:03] 46 ye have
[1:06:06] heard that it had been
[1:06:08] said thou shallal love thy
[1:06:11] neighbor and hate thy
[1:06:14] enemy but I say unto
[1:06:18] you love your
[1:06:22] enemies bless them that do what
[1:06:27] do good to them that what hate you and
[1:06:30] do what pray for them thatp use you and
[1:06:34] persecute you Lord have mercy amen how
[1:06:37] are we going to do that how are you
[1:06:40] humanly going to love them that
[1:06:45] despitefully use you and say all manner
[1:06:48] of evil against
[1:06:52] you can I read y'all something
[1:06:57] this is in a
[1:07:06] footnote here it is by loving your
[1:07:10] enemies loving your enemies is one of
[1:07:13] the greatest statements Jesus ever
[1:07:16] made the love en joying In this passage
[1:07:20] is love that originate from God himself
[1:07:26] other words you will not be able to
[1:07:29] accomplish this kind of love except
[1:07:32] God dwells in
[1:07:36] you because to love somebody that do you
[1:07:39] wrong it don't make you feel
[1:07:42] good and you know they
[1:07:46] deliberately did it to
[1:07:48] you and here Jesus said love them
[1:07:53] anyhow do good good to
[1:07:59] him I'm going tell I believe that this
[1:08:02] is to me you talk a great if we could
[1:08:04] ever get the people of God with this
[1:08:06] message to learn that you know that we
[1:08:09] shouldn't hate no
[1:08:13] one though you may disagree with them
[1:08:16] that's all
[1:08:17] right but you know how we get this
[1:08:19] little funny
[1:08:21] feeling and somebody done done something
[1:08:23] and we cross the street when we see
[1:08:26] him or we turn our our back like we
[1:08:28] don't see
[1:08:29] him that's the time you ought to go
[1:08:32] speak to him
[1:08:35] personally why cuz you will kill that
[1:08:38] spirit amen
[1:08:40] amen amen you will kill that spirit
[1:08:44] because if you get anointed with that
[1:08:46] little you know discomfort spirit and
[1:08:50] you ain't did nothing
[1:08:52] wrong but then what you running from
[1:08:54] them from amen amen
[1:08:56] amen why are you dodging if you are to
[1:08:59] praise the Lord
[1:09:06] sister Ser God say how to be such a love
[1:09:09] amongst us because nobody can love like
[1:09:11] this except the Holy Ghost is in
[1:09:14] them
[1:09:16] amen we are confessing the Holy
[1:09:19] Ghost I mean the real Holy
[1:09:21] Ghost Ser God said what are the evidence
[1:09:24] of the Holy Ghost is love
[1:09:28] amen let me finish that passage cuz it's
[1:09:34] more love your en do good to the pr okay
[1:09:36] 4 to five that ye may be the children of
[1:09:39] your father which is in heaven for he
[1:09:43] maketh the son to rise on the evil and
[1:09:45] on the good and S to rain on the just
[1:09:47] and on the unjust for if you love them
[1:09:51] which love you that this is way we get
[1:09:54] in problem
[1:09:56] if you love them which love you what
[1:09:58] reward have ye do not even the publicans
[1:10:03] the
[1:10:05] same see it's easy to love them that
[1:10:08] love
[1:10:08] you are that ACC company accompany
[1:10:11] himself with you as a
[1:10:15] friend but that's not what God is
[1:10:17] talking about here we must learn how to
[1:10:20] love the
[1:10:23] unlovable the servant of God said you
[1:10:25] can should be able to bitterly disagree
[1:10:28] with a
[1:10:29] person but yet be able to love them
[1:10:32] before you even had a disagreement the
[1:10:35] same you should be able to throw your
[1:10:37] arms around that sister and brother
[1:10:40] don't you disagree with it it's okay to
[1:10:44] disagree but we're not told to
[1:10:47] hate most of the time we disagree
[1:10:50] because there's something we know that
[1:10:51] is wrong about what a person is doing
[1:10:54] Amen in love is correction amen amen but
[1:10:59] you it's hard to correct grown folks in
[1:11:01] this hours amen Christian
[1:11:05] folks you know they'll leave
[1:11:10] church try to correct
[1:11:15] me the Bible say if you can't take
[1:11:20] correction every one of us God has to
[1:11:24] correct us
[1:11:27] and a man say he don't never do nothing
[1:11:29] wrong you better
[1:11:31] run run
[1:11:35] fast it's like the man of God say they
[1:11:38] had that racer went into a job and he
[1:11:41] didn't had no R race on his he said sir
[1:11:44] said your pencil don't have uh no Ras he
[1:11:47] said why don't you he said everybody he
[1:11:49] said because I don't make no mistakes he
[1:11:52] said you won't be doing nothing you got
[1:11:53] to get out of here I can't use
[1:11:57] you we going to make mistakes amen we
[1:12:01] going to fall short but God's grace amen
[1:12:06] amen is able to pick that
[1:12:10] up even in your
[1:12:13] faults your
[1:12:15] shortcoming that don't Cast Away God
[1:12:17] love for you it let us know we need God
[1:12:22] no more amen amen amen there there
[1:12:26] hour that Christians need God no
[1:12:31] more I've never see it now on the
[1:12:36] scale that people so
[1:12:40] unstable you know why because the love
[1:12:42] of
[1:12:44] God the love of God shared abroad in
[1:12:47] your hearts by the Holy
[1:12:49] Ghost the Holy Ghost want to teach you
[1:12:52] how to love them that don't love you
[1:12:54] amen amen
[1:12:57] amen disagree this all right but you
[1:13:00] still loving them amen
[1:13:05] amen but it's so easy for us to get the
[1:13:08] wrong
[1:13:10] interpretation oh brother you love me
[1:13:12] don't you say nothing about what I'm
[1:13:13] doing
[1:13:14] wrong
[1:13:17] no that is not correct if I'm your
[1:13:20] brother if I'm your sister we all
[1:13:23] sometime need to just have to correct
[1:13:26] one another Amen in a loving way amen
[1:13:31] not
[1:13:32] arrogant in time pass let me tell you
[1:13:34] what we done we almost throw them into
[1:13:37] the Lake of
[1:13:40] Fire and we'll call them serpent seed
[1:13:43] and all kind of
[1:13:44] foolishness because they're not up to
[1:13:47] your
[1:13:50] expectations but if you look close
[1:13:52] enough you'll find out you're not up
[1:13:54] there either
[1:13:57] cuz if you had the right Spirit on you
[1:14:00] you would know how to go to your brother
[1:14:02] in meekness amen
[1:14:06] amen and then the Bible say those who
[1:14:09] are spiritual there do
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:13] what yes I had a scripture
[1:14:18] go you spiritually you should be able to
[1:14:20] go to the
[1:14:21] weak the strong are to Bear the
[1:14:25] infirmities of the weak
[1:14:29] amen why because that we understand that
[1:14:32] we were like that one
[1:14:34] time you wasn't always where you at now
[1:14:39] amen that's why you ever now to lend a
[1:14:42] helping hand to somebody that's falling
[1:14:46] down or falling
[1:14:48] away you know how to go to them with
[1:14:50] love and say sister it's going to be all
[1:14:53] right amen amen amen just don't stay
[1:14:57] there amen amen give them your right
[1:15:00] hand and bring them back into the F
[1:15:03] don't let them just well I know she
[1:15:05] should have never did that
[1:15:08] anyhow you worse off than she
[1:15:13] is you know we got so many super duper
[1:15:16] duper spiritual people around this
[1:15:18] message I'm a little afraid of
[1:15:22] them they're so spiritual
[1:15:26] intellectually but when it come to
[1:15:28] producing the very literary life of
[1:15:32] God and letting love through fall
[1:15:34] through their
[1:15:36] heart can't do
[1:15:40] it I didn't even get to first um 1
[1:15:43] Corinthians
[1:15:46] 13 Paul said you can know all Mysteries
[1:15:49] have your body to be
[1:15:51] burned he said if you have not charity
[1:15:55] he said it profit you nothing you can
[1:15:57] know all the
[1:15:59] Mysteries Lord have mercy and don't we
[1:16:02] know the
[1:16:03] Mysteries but have not charity amen
[1:16:08] which is the bond of
[1:16:12] perfection
[1:16:15] love oh
[1:16:17] my Ser God say even the worst sinner
[1:16:20] know when you love them amen amen they
[1:16:27] know well they can feel
[1:16:30] that he said even animals know when you
[1:16:33] love
[1:16:37] them sometime we you know as people
[1:16:41] human beings you know our nature when
[1:16:43] things come about especially when
[1:16:44] animals all we be we get scared
[1:16:49] first and don't you know an animal can
[1:16:51] pick up your
[1:16:53] sphere and that that's why he
[1:16:57] bites Serv God said he stood there
[1:16:59] before lions and and different animals
[1:17:02] he said he was so close he said they
[1:17:04] could have actually killed me but he
[1:17:06] said but they knew I love
[1:17:11] them I wish that we can love one another
[1:17:14] so much that in spite of what one
[1:17:17] another might do or what might happen to
[1:17:19] them that we can still say you still my
[1:17:22] sister and I want to help you if I can
[1:17:25] maybe I can pray with
[1:17:28] you to
[1:17:31] encourage there one scripture I'm not

[1:17:47] yourself I told one brother I said you
[1:17:49] know we you want to help this one I said
[1:17:51] first you got to get
[1:17:53] help and when we can get this love of
[1:17:56] God so in our hearts then we can share
[1:18:00] that we can spread that love of
[1:18:08] God in Ephesians 3:17 said Christ the
[1:18:11] Welling our heart said Let It Be rooted
[1:18:14] in
[1:18:16] love let the Holy Ghost Let It Be
[1:18:21] rooted in Love Inside of us ought to be
[1:18:26] love so rooted for God

[1:20:52] cause us to examine ourselves and see
[1:20:54] whether we be be in the faith amen so by
[1:20:57] the grace of God we thank God for
[1:20:59] brother Palmer and appreciate the
[1:21:03] word I want you to know that we on high
[1:21:10] alert it's a very serious time I don't
[1:21:14] know whether you've
[1:21:17] seen the Ukraine going into
[1:21:22] Russia if you hadn't you know don't know
[1:21:25] about it then the prophet
[1:21:27] had seven Visions in
[1:21:33] 1933 the sixth Vision we saw a woman
[1:21:36] even to be president or vice
[1:21:42] president and he saw the Catholic Church
[1:21:45] rising up in
[1:21:48] America so it's it's
[1:21:51] twofold we got to already got a woman
[1:21:54] Vice President we on the verge we might
[1:21:57] have a
[1:21:58] woman
[1:22:01] president the seven Vision was he
[1:22:04] saw the Russia blowed up
[1:22:10] America and the soldiers was was
[1:22:14] ravaging the
[1:22:18] women now this invasion in the Ukraine
[1:22:22] they're saying
[1:22:27] that America and its allies are all
[1:22:31] behind
[1:22:36] that and he was talking
[1:22:39] about
[1:22:41] nuclear
[1:22:44] war
[1:22:45] Putin at one
[1:22:48] time it's kind of quiet and it's
[1:22:52] breaking out we in the serious
[1:22:57] hour the earthquake that hit Japan and
[1:23:00] then came on hit Cal Los Angeles 4.4 or
[1:23:04] something shaking Cal Lo Los Angeles up
[1:23:08] Prophet said he saw Los Angeles
[1:23:13] going and you know if he saw an Invision
[1:23:16] form and never
[1:23:20] fail so I'm saying where are
[1:23:23] we it's going to be a test those that
[1:23:26] don't believe that God sent a true
[1:23:28] prophet in this age it's going to be
[1:23:31] tested will they wake up when it's too
[1:23:35] late or will you be
[1:23:39] serious and realize that God
[1:23:42] has sent a prophet to warn us of the
[1:23:46] oncoming
[1:23:48] storm but yet we are not taking it
[1:23:51] serious
[1:23:53] true coming to church going in and
[1:23:57] out if you know at any time the bombs
[1:24:01] could
[1:24:04] fall you know I I I don't know do you
[1:24:07] think Russia ever thought Ukraine would
[1:24:09] do
[1:24:13] that and you think do you think within
[1:24:18] yourself that there's not going to be
[1:24:22] retaliation and if it is is where do you
[1:24:25] stand
[1:24:28] tonight if they retaliate where do you
[1:24:32] stand with
[1:24:36] God are you
[1:24:38] ready for the
[1:24:45] consequences you know we can lift our
[1:24:47] head up and jeriah said the Babylon the
[1:24:49] king of Babylon is coming is coming he
[1:24:52] was smacked they slapped him
[1:24:55] nothing going to
[1:24:57] happen are you with me yes
[1:25:00] sir and we got a message to tell us
[1:25:03] what's going to
[1:25:05] happen but if we say you got to get
[1:25:09] serious with God
[1:25:13] people why because we we think we so
[1:25:17] secure because we a message Believers or
[1:25:20] we got a pro it ain't about that it's
[1:25:23] whether or not you're taking it serious
[1:25:26] what's the purpose of it that you get
[1:25:28] serious with God and realize you can get
[1:25:30] ready warning before what Jud judgment
[1:25:35] we've been
[1:25:36] warn now when judgment hit you and say
[1:25:39] well I I had all in my
[1:25:43] vessel and then you left here with all

[1:26:04] Y y'all just didn't tell us right y'all
[1:26:06] should have told us that that's the
[1:26:09] purpose of God sent the prophet to warn
[1:26:11] us but but why y'all didn't put no more
[1:26:15] emphasis on
