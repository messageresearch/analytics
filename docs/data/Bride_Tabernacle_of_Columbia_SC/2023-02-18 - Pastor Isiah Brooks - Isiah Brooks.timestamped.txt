[40:28] 14th verse
[40:31] you know this is a pretty good crowd for
[40:32] Wednesday night oh this Friday isn't it

[40:38] days are all mixed up but nevertheless
[40:40] we appreciate you all being here
[40:43] Philippians the third chapter 14 verses
[40:47] I press toward the mock
[40:50] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[40:54] in Christ Jesus
[40:57] then we ask that you turn with us to
[40:59] Joshua the first chapter
[41:08] Moses my servant is dead beginning at
[41:11] the second verse
[41:13] now therefore arise go over this Jordan
[41:17] thou and all this people
[41:20] unto the land which I do give to them
[41:23] even to the children of Israel
[41:27] every place that the soul of your foot
[41:30] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[41:34] you as I said unto Moses let us pray
[41:41] father God we come before you Lord as
[41:43] humbly as we know how
[41:45] we thank you for being so good to us
[41:49] and father you've been better to us than
[41:51] we have been to ourselves
[41:53] and Lord I use that phrase in my uh
[41:56] prayer all the time because it's so true
[41:59] it will always be true
[42:01] father you take care of us
[42:04] even when we're not as faithful as we
[42:06] should be
[42:07] you have held your faithfulness and we
[42:11] realize this night oh God that great is
[42:14] thy faithfulness unto us and we thank
[42:17] you Lord Jesus
[42:19] for you are the only true and living God
[42:23] that is not by hearing of someone else's
[42:26] words but it's a revelation that you
[42:29] have given unto us
[42:31] there's none like you there's none that
[42:33] will come before you or even after you
[42:35] and father we praise you tonight we give
[42:38] you the praise we give you the glory we
[42:40] give the honor and father you're worthy
[42:43] of all praise thank you our Lord and
[42:46] Savior Jesus Christ for being the savior
[42:49] of the world for being my lord for being
[42:52] my savior for being my Revelation in
[42:56] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[42:59] be seated
[43:03] I'm going to preach a message that uh
[43:05] I preached in my own church
[43:09] so if I say anything that will pinch you
[43:13] uh know that you're not the first to be
[43:15] pinched
[43:17] We Believe by God's grace that the
[43:21] problem of problems that we've had uh in
[43:26] this message or around the message it's
[43:29] because we have not been to sincere
[43:32] enough or consecrated enough
[43:35] and and I believe that's the hour in
[43:37] which we're living in
[43:40] um here the scripture tells us that
[43:42] there is a Mark that we must press
[43:45] and I want to ask a question which you
[43:47] don't have to answer but in your spirit
[43:49] uh uh you will know you you can answer
[43:52] yay or nay the truth of the matter is I
[43:55] want to say like this how many of us
[43:58] have been truly pressing
[44:02] now we see by the grace of God the
[44:05] scripture tells us that Joshua in Joshua
[44:08] Moses is dead and we're not going to
[44:10] work so much with Moses but we're going
[44:13] to work with Joshua uh because we
[44:16] realize that you know Moses amen is has
[44:19] done his uh uh uh uh uh purpose on Earth
[44:23] and and now the ministry is moving uh on
[44:27] uh to a Joshua Ministry but the Bible
[44:30] tells us in in the Book of Joshua that
[44:33] uh Joshua has no word of his own but he
[44:37] has to follow the words that Moses had
[44:40] spoken and so we realize amen that it is
[44:44] important a man that we know what's been
[44:46] said and what's been laid down for us we
[44:50] understand I understand this is my faith
[44:52] and this is the way I believe that when
[44:55] God opened the word and opened the seals
[44:57] uh God gave us a new a new message it
[45:01] wasn't the message of just of just
[45:03] Pentecost but it was that plus it was an
[45:06] addition to what God wanted us to know
[45:09] and what he wanted us to understand why
[45:12] because the word of God according to
[45:14] revelation 3 here Jesus Christ was put
[45:17] out of the church but in that time God
[45:20] was drawing and pulling a people from
[45:23] every denomination in in every
[45:26] organization to form a bride and and so
[45:30] we realize amen that when the word was
[45:32] opened it was it was like what happened
[45:35] Amen in the days of John when John
[45:38] pointed to Jesus he told his disciples
[45:41] this is the one that's greater than than
[45:44] I am and whose shoes I'm not worthy to
[45:47] loose we find out that in uh in that uh
[45:51] uh setting that everybody that followed
[45:55] John didn't leave John but they stayed
[45:58] with John and and they went all and only
[46:01] a two if I got it right according to the
[46:03] prophet only two of them followed Jesus
[46:07] and we see that same setting we've seen
[46:11] that same thing happen with us it's not
[46:15] about Malachi 4 anymore in that sense we
[46:19] understand what he's done we understand
[46:22] his position and there was a time in
[46:25] history that was needed to know we
[46:27] needed to know that we we needed that
[46:29] Foundation we needed to know everything
[46:32] that God had done through him in order
[46:34] to know what God was willing to do
[46:36] through us
[46:38] and so we must understand by the grace
[46:41] of God Amen all of the things that the
[46:43] brothers and I don't criticize anybody
[46:46] because they were anointed to do what
[46:48] they were supposed to do
[46:51] but I saw a little
[46:54] uh reading the other day
[46:57] and it says
[46:59] the bend in the road
[47:03] is not the end of the road
[47:06] except you make the turn
[47:10] and that's what happened in our day many
[47:13] people
[47:15] fail to take the turn
[47:17] and We Know by the grace of God Amen we
[47:21] are not in building a building it's not
[47:24] straight walls
[47:25] but there are turns that all of us must
[47:28] make
[47:29] and we understand that Malachi 4 taught
[47:31] us that we must make a turn this is what
[47:34] he was talking about it's time to turn
[47:38] and we fail to turn
[47:40] and because we failed to turn
[47:43] we had a shipwreck
[47:46] but there are those now who the word of
[47:49] God is being quickened they're beginning
[47:52] to see and then what the message is all
[47:55] about
[47:56] and the message is not all about a
[47:59] Malachi 4 anymore
[48:01] but it's about Revelation 8 all the way
[48:04] through 11 a bride
[48:06] a people that will prophesy again
[48:10] and you and I must understand that what
[48:13] this message is doing to us if it's not
[48:16] changing you
[48:17] you don't have the revelation
[48:21] that you're supposed to have
[48:23] because this message
[48:25] is to bring about a change the word of
[48:29] God that we are now feasting on wasn't
[48:31] just shoe brand
[48:33] but it was the bread from out of the uh
[48:36] the Veil Amen in everything within the
[48:40] Veil amen no matter what it was it was
[48:43] sanctified
[48:45] it was consecrated with the blood of
[48:48] Jesus Christ had been applied
[48:50] Hallelujah it had a purpose and
[48:54] therefore amen the Shekinah Glory was
[48:57] able to to show its fullness
[49:01] in that place
[49:03] Hallelujah that's where we are tonight
[49:07] Hallelujah and to look back would be the
[49:11] same thing that every Church age has
[49:13] done
[49:15] come on somebody you see it was the
[49:17] unveiling of God when God unveiled
[49:21] himself he was showing it was no not a
[49:24] man it's never been a man it has always
[49:28] been Christ
[49:30] Jesus amen moving through the human
[49:33] vessel and then proving that he's the
[49:36] same yesterday today and forever it's
[49:39] the Revelation the power of this
[49:42] Revelation if it ever sets in your heart
[49:46] you will never be the same
[49:49] Hallelujah
[49:51] Jesus himself
[49:53] had to come to know who he was by the
[49:57] scripture
[49:58] and how can you preach a message without
[50:00] the Bible
[50:02] Hallelujah you could never accurately
[50:06] preach this message without the Bible
[50:10] hello somebody you got to understand
[50:14] Hallelujah that the message itself never
[50:17] did come to contradict it it came to
[50:21] unveil it it came to give this this the
[50:25] letter of the word new meaning and a
[50:29] deeper revelation
[50:30] is that right let me say it like this it
[50:34] came to magnify
[50:37] what was already written
[50:39] is that what Jesus did he came to
[50:42] magnify he said listen your law says if
[50:46] a man or woman be caught in a in the act
[50:50] of adultery they are adulterers
[50:53] but he says let me magnify it
[50:57] if you look upon a woman
[50:59] and and lust in your heart you've
[51:02] already committed adultery hello
[51:05] somebody you see this message came to to
[51:09] do what magnify
[51:11] how I how can I say it the the the
[51:15] New Testament
[51:17] was the revelation of the Old Testament
[51:22] and the message
[51:23] is a revelation of the Old and New
[51:26] Testament
[51:28] Hallelujah it brings it to a full book
[51:32] a full word and a full Revelation why
[51:36] because it's come to produce a Perfect
[51:39] Bride
[51:41] Hallelujah
[51:42] and listen we're all learning but we
[51:46] must move forward and the only way we're
[51:49] going to move forward we've got to be
[51:51] better more consecrated we've got to be
[51:54] more sincere there is no way you are
[51:58] consider yourself bride and you take in
[52:02] your life and dragging it through the
[52:04] mud
[52:05] Hallelujah you can't look at these
[52:08] things of the world be a part of the
[52:10] world act like the world and call
[52:13] yourself bride you are deceiving
[52:16] yourself
[52:19] Hallelujah
[52:21] it is God who sanctifies us
[52:24] Hallelujah is that right even the
[52:27] prophet of God had to come to know who
[52:30] he was is that right at the first he
[52:33] didn't he was Malachi 4 and God unveiled
[52:36] that to him it didn't stop there it kept
[52:40] going little by little year by year and
[52:44] every move he made
[52:46] he grew in the knowledge of his calling
[52:49] and who he was in the scripture and each
[52:54] step he made forward meant more death to
[52:58] self
[52:59] and more consecration so is it with the
[53:02] bride of Jesus Christ
[53:04] she must understand the closer we get to
[53:07] God the more you must die to yourself
[53:11] Hallelujah is that the right is that
[53:14] right Paul listen this is a powerful
[53:16] revelation Paul said listen
[53:19] it's not I that lives I want you to
[53:22] think about that he said it's not I that
[53:25] lives but it's Christ who lives in me
[53:30] Hallelujah in other words God had moved
[53:34] Paul into a position there was no more
[53:36] Paul
[53:39] Hallelujah
[53:40] Paul had no more attitude
[53:43] it was all Jesus Christ
[53:46] so you can understand God is not wanting
[53:49] your body to share it with you but you
[53:52] must die and rot to all of your behavior
[53:56] all of your thoughts all of your desires
[53:59] everything that you was born into this
[54:01] world with Must Die
[54:05] Hallelujah
[54:09] the problem
[54:12] even with most preachers
[54:14] they're not dead
[54:19] Hallelujah
[54:21] is that true
[54:23] Paul said I didn't come to preach myself
[54:27] he said I didn't come to preach myself
[54:30] I come to preach Jesus
[54:32] and him crucified
[54:34] Paul said I don't know nothing
[54:36] everything I've ever learned he said I
[54:39] counted as dumb
[54:41] that I might learn that I might know him
[54:44] in the power of his resurrection
[54:46] Hallelujah that I might even know him in
[54:49] his suffering somebody help me here
[54:52] tonight you see we've got to realize
[54:54] that this calling is a high calling
[54:58] Hallelujah do you know what that means
[55:01] you weren't called by a bishop you
[55:04] wasn't called by a preacher you weren't
[55:06] called by uh uh
[55:08] any kind of Presbyterian but you were
[55:12] called
[55:13] Hallelujah from a high calling above
[55:18] this Earth above this realm your calling
[55:22] came from eternity
[55:24] Hallelujah and because it is a high
[55:28] calling we must treat it as a high
[55:30] calling
[55:35] Hallelujah the problem is
[55:38] we've been treating it like it's just
[55:39] religion
[55:41] and there's so many people in this
[55:43] message
[55:44] who's not even saved
[55:47] oh lordy
[55:49] think about it
[55:50] everybody people who could quote brother
[55:52] Branham quote Paul and Peter and John
[55:56] and never was truly born again
[55:59] they learn
[56:02] the systematic way of worship
[56:05] oh come on somebody they knew all the
[56:08] [Music]
[56:09] other and they were pretty good
[56:11] like the Rich Young Ruler he knew the
[56:14] system
[56:15] knew the do's and don'ts he knew the
[56:18] touch not taste not had or not but that
[56:21] wasn't it Hallelujah and Jesus said
[56:25] accept your righteousness
[56:29] exceeds the righteousness of the
[56:32] Pharisees and the Sadducees you will in
[56:35] no eyes enter in
[56:37] Hallelujah this is why the word of God
[56:40] says it's not by power
[56:43] is not by might
[56:45] but it's by my Holy Spirit
[56:47] Hallelujah and let me tell you something
[56:50] the truth of the matter is
[56:52] we're failing to see it
[56:54] that we've been called to be Miss Jesus
[56:56] Christ
[56:59] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[57:02] we've been called to be Miss Jesus
[57:04] Christ
[57:05] but we find people say well I'm in the
[57:07] message
[57:08] that ain't even it
[57:11] we made it a denomination
[57:14] we've made it some kind of way of system
[57:16] I'm in the message what is that that's
[57:19] like I'm Pentecostal I'm Apostolic you
[57:23] know I'm this I'm that Hallelujah we
[57:26] have been called to be the word and in
[57:29] order to be the word you must die
[57:33] and write to yourself
[57:36] into your ideas
[57:38] oh it's true people get all angry and
[57:41] carry on like they ain't got no sense
[57:43] and you think that's going in the
[57:46] rapture
[57:47] hello that has to die
[57:51] hallelujah look look even those are
[57:54] Friday night the church should be filled
[57:58] but where are they
[58:00] you understand what I'm saying it's not
[58:03] based on that but when you love Jesus
[58:06] and you love worship and you you love to
[58:10] be in the house of God you don't care if
[58:13] it's snowing you don't care if it's
[58:15] raining Hallelujah you don't care what
[58:19] kind of weather goes on you talk to the
[58:22] Lord
[58:23] he says Lord is it your will for me to
[58:24] go to the church
[58:26] and if he says yes you go
[58:29] y'all hear what I'm saying see a lot of
[58:32] times we we're so oh my but I guarantee
[58:36] you
[58:37] it don't stop the people from going to
[58:39] the restaurants in the rain
[58:42] in the cold
[58:44] they're gonna go
[58:46] they'll feed the Natural Body and they
[58:49] forget the spiritual
[58:50] people I'm not trying to fuss but I am
[58:53] so sick and tired
[58:56] of what I see as a systematic worship
[58:59] God hates it and so do I
[59:03] Hallelujah if you can't get stirred
[59:06] until the music goes up
[59:09] something's wrong with you
[59:11] check your experience
[59:13] Hallelujah because you're supposed to
[59:16] enter into this place Hallelujah with
[59:18] Thanksgiving you're supposed to be fired
[59:21] up already listen you know I'm tired
[59:25] in my physical body but my soul is
[59:29] what's controlling now
[59:33] because when your soul
[59:39] Hallelujah you hear what I'm saying
[59:42] don't let this thing become so common to
[59:45] you well you have nothing to offer the
[59:48] children that's coming on after you
[59:53] your nature must be changed
[59:57] you know the problem is we don't pray
[59:59] we don't pray
[1:00:01] you know you know what they tell me and
[1:00:04] my wife pointed this out to me the other
[1:00:05] day it was on a little clipping I don't
[1:00:07] know whether YouTube or whatever it was
[1:00:09] they said the Jews prayed three times a
[1:00:13] day
[1:00:14] and the Muslim systematically prays five
[1:00:18] times a day and the Christian prayed one
[1:00:21] time a day or might pray one time a day
[1:00:24] and they figured that's going to keep it
[1:00:27] going
[1:00:28] shame on us
[1:00:30] even when it comes Amen to Daniel
[1:00:34] he knew
[1:00:36] he need to talk to God three times a day
[1:00:39] how many of us still read our Bible
[1:00:42] how many of us study it and and look at
[1:00:45] it and and you know what I'm not looking
[1:00:47] for how I can memorize it I'm looking to
[1:00:51] see how it can be applied
[1:00:54] I want to change I want to change people
[1:00:58] and that's what I look for I look for
[1:01:01] change
[1:01:05] a change in nature
[1:01:07] brings about a change of name
[1:01:12] and a change of name
[1:01:14] brings about a change in authority
[1:01:19] huh Jacob was a shyster
[1:01:23] but Jacob had a change of nature
[1:01:27] and therefore when he had a change of
[1:01:29] nature he had a name change and that
[1:01:33] name changed Israel brought in authority
[1:01:37] y'all hear what I'm saying you said well
[1:01:40] brother Brooks I'm the bride well you
[1:01:42] are if your Nature has been changed
[1:01:49] Jacob
[1:01:50] could not his name could never be
[1:01:53] changed that's why you see Christians
[1:01:55] still being shysters
[1:01:59] because their nature hasn't been changed
[1:02:02] but somewhere you've got to do like
[1:02:05] Jacob you got a wrestle with the angel
[1:02:08] but most of us don't want to pray
[1:02:10] we don't want to get down on our knees
[1:02:13] sometimes we get down on our knees amen
[1:02:16] and we think an hour has gone by
[1:02:19] and we look up and it's only 10 minutes
[1:02:23] see it shows that you you rush to you
[1:02:26] you Out Of Tune you're not connected
[1:02:29] but when you get connected
[1:02:32] time matters not
[1:02:34] Hallelujah you can talk to God and he'll
[1:02:37] talk back to you now I don't know about
[1:02:39] I don't know whether he talks to you but
[1:02:42] my God talks back to me I learned to
[1:02:46] talk to him and I wait till he speaks
[1:02:49] back to me
[1:02:50] Hallelujah is that the truth
[1:02:53] when Jesus Jesus had to overcome death
[1:02:56] hell in the grave but you know what he
[1:02:58] did first he prayed
[1:03:02] hello he had to cut overcome the natural
[1:03:07] man
[1:03:08] the natural man didn't want to go to
[1:03:10] Calvary
[1:03:11] Hallelujah and most of us don't want to
[1:03:15] die but you in order to live you've got
[1:03:18] to die
[1:03:20] Hallelujah and you got to get down on
[1:03:23] your knees wherever in your closet in
[1:03:26] your car in your no matter where it's at
[1:03:29] but wherever you know you can make a
[1:03:32] contact
[1:03:33] Hallelujah
[1:03:35] that's where you go
[1:03:37] Hallelujah you got to forget about your
[1:03:39] neighbor you got to forget about your
[1:03:41] friend you got to forget about your
[1:03:43] husband and your wife this is between
[1:03:46] you and God
[1:03:48] Hallelujah and you've got to go all the
[1:03:51] way because this is a higher calling yes
[1:03:54] sir there was a time we could shout we
[1:03:58] could dance and we thought that was the
[1:03:59] ultimate
[1:04:01] but then we found out
[1:04:03] that was just the beginning
[1:04:05] Hallelujah Miriam shouted on the Red Sea
[1:04:09] Shore but that was just the beginning
[1:04:12] she still had a journey to make
[1:04:15] Hallelujah and though she criticize the
[1:04:18] prophet God smitten her with leprosy
[1:04:22] glory to God y'all understand what I'm
[1:04:24] saying and leprosy is a sin is unbelief
[1:04:27] Hallelujah but it didn't stop
[1:04:30] God kept on moving now if God called 2
[1:04:34] million
[1:04:35] let's say 2 million out of Egypt
[1:04:39] think about it
[1:04:40] each one of those persons were judged by
[1:04:45] the word and they didn't even know it
[1:04:49] and you know what they did they failed
[1:04:52] to go all the way
[1:04:54] they failed to see it wasn't never a man
[1:04:58] it was God in a man
[1:05:01] Hallelujah to them they weren't just
[1:05:04] looking at Moses they was looking behind
[1:05:07] that Veil
[1:05:08] and because they saw what was behind the
[1:05:11] veil come on anybody in their right mind
[1:05:13] know that no man can heal another man
[1:05:18] only Jesus Christ
[1:05:20] he is the Healer and if he's in you
[1:05:24] then you can do what he says do
[1:05:26] is that right
[1:05:28] oh come on somebody how many years we've
[1:05:32] gone through and heard that the people
[1:05:33] said well the prophet of God did this
[1:05:35] and the prophet of God did that and the
[1:05:37] prophet of God did this and then the
[1:05:39] prophet God said I didn't do nothing
[1:05:43] never did anything
[1:05:45] he never healed anybody
[1:05:47] he never saved anybody
[1:05:51] Hallelujah it was never him it was the
[1:05:56] Christ
[1:05:57] Jesus Christ that told him what to do
[1:06:01] Hallelujah it wasn't his own words and
[1:06:03] his own thoughts
[1:06:05] just like it is now
[1:06:08] they that are led by the spirit of God
[1:06:11] they are the sons of God
[1:06:14] that relationship wasn't just given to a
[1:06:17] prophet
[1:06:18] that relationship was given to his bride
[1:06:21] Hallelujah come on somebody I believe
[1:06:23] with all my heart this is a higher
[1:06:25] calling and the only way you're going to
[1:06:27] get there is that you got to make up in
[1:06:29] your mind to stop all of this
[1:06:31] foolishness
[1:06:34] Hallelujah because I can't see you
[1:06:37] doesn't mean God can't
[1:06:40] Hallelujah
[1:06:41] come on somebody's the truth
[1:06:44] Hallelujah you can always tell
[1:06:46] what's really in a person when they
[1:06:48] under pressure
[1:06:49] the real you come out
[1:06:51] Hallelujah but you see we want that real
[1:06:54] you to stop
[1:06:56] it has to come to a stop
[1:06:58] it has to die and it has to rot
[1:07:02] come on somebody let me before I get any
[1:07:05] further with this because I can almost
[1:07:06] feel it
[1:07:08] you can't do one thing
[1:07:11] no man can add one Cuba to his statue
[1:07:16] it takes the maker
[1:07:19] it takes the potterer
[1:07:21] the man who created you
[1:07:24] he's the only one that can fashion
[1:07:26] inform you he's the only one that can
[1:07:29] shape you
[1:07:30] but the only way he can do it is that
[1:07:33] you humble yourself
[1:07:35] and say Lord not my will
[1:07:37] but thine be done
[1:07:40] Hallelujah you love the Lord let's move
[1:07:43] on sincerity this is what I'm working
[1:07:45] with
[1:07:46] because you know I have been so alarmed
[1:07:50] you know by people
[1:07:53] in the message and some of the things
[1:07:54] they do
[1:07:56] and you know this is what gets me
[1:07:58] because if you're not careful the
[1:08:02] anointing of somebody else will anoint
[1:08:04] you
[1:08:07] that's the truth
[1:08:08] you have to keep yourself separated
[1:08:11] every day
[1:08:13] by prayer amen
[1:08:17] sincerity
[1:08:18] it is the quality of being free
[1:08:22] from pretense
[1:08:24] and deceit
[1:08:25] or hypocrisy
[1:08:28] amen hallelujah oh it's amazing people
[1:08:31] come up shake your hand love you brother
[1:08:32] and you know they don't
[1:08:35] it's hypocrisy
[1:08:37] hallelujah it's the seed
[1:08:41] come on somebody but isn't it a
[1:08:44] wonderful thing when P when somebody can
[1:08:45] say about a brother and sister you know
[1:08:48] the sincerity of his or her belief is
[1:08:51] unquestionable
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:54] why because we don't play the
[1:08:56] foolishness anymore we're tired of being
[1:08:58] children we've got to grow up into
[1:09:01] Christ
[1:09:03] Hallelujah
[1:09:05] some people they come to church
[1:09:08] and if if everybody's not shouting and
[1:09:10] dancing and running you know they say
[1:09:12] the church is getting dead but what is
[1:09:15] the church
[1:09:18] huh
[1:09:19] when you say that it's the church is
[1:09:21] getting dead
[1:09:23] you're getting dead too
[1:09:27] you see I don't care if if 90 of the
[1:09:31] people in this place is not responding
[1:09:34] to the word you
[1:09:37] if you have a true revelation of Who You
[1:09:40] Are
[1:09:40] you will never let the church stop you
[1:09:45] from worship and praise
[1:09:49] I don't care sisters if all of the women
[1:09:52] start wearing their dresses above their
[1:09:54] knee
[1:09:56] you have a revelation
[1:09:59] what God requires for you
[1:10:02] and you don't care if they persecute you
[1:10:05] come on somebody because Jacob
[1:10:09] Hallelujah he shall always persecuted
[1:10:12] Jacob
[1:10:13] but when you're born again
[1:10:15] you shut your eyes to that nonsense
[1:10:18] you don't care about what people say
[1:10:20] about you
[1:10:21] do ya well she said that what who came
[1:10:26] if you dared you didn't hear it
[1:10:31] huh
[1:10:32] glory to God that's what sincerity you
[1:10:35] see the problem is y'all remember when
[1:10:37] we first came to the message we put all
[1:10:41] all of our heart into it
[1:10:43] and we were so sincere
[1:10:45] y'all hear what I'm saying but something
[1:10:48] how
[1:10:50] we allowed
[1:10:52] what we saw in other places to affect us
[1:10:57] and so we got into the systematic
[1:11:00] worship too
[1:11:01] Hallelujah you know you don't praise God
[1:11:05] until somebody else does
[1:11:07] you know I mean you don't shout
[1:11:10] hallelujah till somebody else does
[1:11:13] I mean come on you you you you you look
[1:11:16] around and God wants you to dance and
[1:11:18] you won't even dance because nobody else
[1:11:20] is dancing
[1:11:21] Hallelujah but I'm gonna tell you
[1:11:23] something no that's wrong
[1:11:25] why why should I live right if everybody
[1:11:28] else is not
[1:11:29] because everybody else is not me
[1:11:33] Hallelujah I've been born again
[1:11:36] Hallelujah yes is that young to me I got
[1:11:39] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost got me
[1:11:43] Hallelujah
[1:11:45] Hallelujah who are you following
[1:11:49] you following Christ
[1:11:51] or a man
[1:11:53] yeah boy y'all really thinking hard on
[1:11:56] that one
[1:11:59] they that are led by the spirit
[1:12:01] they are the sons of God not they that
[1:12:04] are led by the man
[1:12:06] y'all understand me
[1:12:08] those who are Holy Ghost filled are led
[1:12:11] by the spirit
[1:12:12] now I don't I'm not taken away from the
[1:12:15] pastor because he's Holy Ghost Field too
[1:12:17] and you've got to honor him
[1:12:23] Hallelujah some people say well I'm so
[1:12:26] free that's what we did
[1:12:28] oh he gonna be a nicolaitan
[1:12:32] no
[1:12:33] he has the authority
[1:12:35] and a lot of times people don't want to
[1:12:37] I don't know why I'm here he didn't
[1:12:39] nobody talk to me I don't but I'm gonna
[1:12:41] say it anyway because we got to realize
[1:12:44] God has set authorities places and
[1:12:47] positions
[1:12:48] and in order to honor God you've got to
[1:12:50] honor those positions
[1:12:53] y'all hear what I'm saying now if the
[1:12:55] preacher wrong that's a different story
[1:12:57] but if he's right
[1:12:59] that means you got to follow it
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:03] is that right let me give you a
[1:13:04] scripture Paul said follow me as I
[1:13:07] follow Christ
[1:13:08] you love the Lord
[1:13:10] the pride of Jesus Christ will be she is
[1:13:13] Miss Jesus Christ
[1:13:16] what qualifies her she's baptized in the
[1:13:19] spirit in his name right
[1:13:22] not father Son and Holy Ghost in his
[1:13:25] name filled with his power
[1:13:28] robed in his righteousness I didn't say
[1:13:31] mine
[1:13:32] I said his
[1:13:34] Hallelujah you can't even be Sanctified
[1:13:37] unless you Sanctified in his
[1:13:39] sanctification
[1:13:41] Hallelujah you could never get it all
[1:13:44] right the
[1:13:45] fact that we needed a savior
[1:13:48] that's why we need Jesus Hallelujah
[1:13:52] is that right like I said you got to put
[1:13:54] all your heart into it
[1:13:58] Hallelujah y'all know this is so true
[1:14:01] when it comes down to the word of God
[1:14:03] when it comes down to Jesus somehow we
[1:14:05] want to put him on the sideline like you
[1:14:07] know Simon did in you know what I mean
[1:14:10] you come to church and he's in the
[1:14:11] corner there that needs and nobody's
[1:14:13] attending to him but we have been
[1:14:16] ordained to entertain him
[1:14:19] did you all know that
[1:14:21] we come to entertain Jesus
[1:14:24] I would never come back to your house
[1:14:27] if you come to if you're supposed to
[1:14:29] entertain me and I come in there and you
[1:14:32] don't even give me a glass of water
[1:14:35] huh you won't even welcome me and then
[1:14:38] you got this big cake on the table
[1:14:41] you got some ham or some chicken or
[1:14:43] whatever and all the fragrances in the
[1:14:45] house and you won't even offer me any
[1:14:49] entertain me
[1:14:53] y'all understand me and that's the way
[1:14:56] it's supposed to be when you come to God
[1:14:58] when you come to this listen whether you
[1:15:01] come here or not but when you come to
[1:15:03] the house of God you're supposed to
[1:15:05] entertain him
[1:15:07] how with your lips praise at him with
[1:15:10] your hands clapping and worshiping him
[1:15:13] with your dance that's what you're
[1:15:15] supposed to do we used to be on fire
[1:15:22] huh
[1:15:23] I did that turn like brother Simmons I
[1:15:25] must have caught something right there
[1:15:28] I felt brother Simmons when I did that
[1:15:32] Hallelujah
[1:15:34] so you gotta understand by the grace of
[1:15:36] God you and I must emotions say Lord
[1:15:39] help me sincerity brings us back to the
[1:15:42] word sacred
[1:15:46] and you've been summons
[1:15:49] by the Holy Spirit
[1:15:51] Hallelujah
[1:15:53] and right now you say well I want the
[1:15:56] Holy Ghost but God ain't gonna give you
[1:15:57] the Holy Ghost if you still living
[1:15:58] filthy
[1:16:03] and filthy doesn't mean you're out there
[1:16:06] doing it
[1:16:07] but the Bible said even if you are
[1:16:08] entertained
[1:16:10] by those people that are doing it
[1:16:13] there's your TV
[1:16:15] he said you are just as guilty as the
[1:16:19] ones that that's entertaining you
[1:16:22] do you realize what you're doing
[1:16:25] I'm not going to be long
[1:16:27] oh Lord
[1:16:29] it's something about pursue you know you
[1:16:33] pursue something when you really want
[1:16:35] something you pursue like the woman with
[1:16:37] the issue of blood
[1:16:38] right uh she was you know she was
[1:16:41] unclean so she couldn't allow the crowd
[1:16:43] to know she was there but she saw Jesus
[1:16:46] she broke all the laws and the rules
[1:16:52] to find Jesus you understand me and she
[1:16:56] saw him and in within herself she said
[1:16:59] if I could just touch
[1:17:00] the hymn of this comment I'll be made
[1:17:02] whole
[1:17:03] now I'm preaching something
[1:17:06] that should have been how can I say it
[1:17:11] is overdue
[1:17:14] this is overdue
[1:17:16] if we had only seen and understood the
[1:17:20] calling
[1:17:21] but as we grow and mature we see okay
[1:17:25] there are things I must get rid of
[1:17:26] that's not even sinful
[1:17:28] but I've got to be sacred
[1:17:31] I got to be holy
[1:17:33] I got to be dedicated to this calling
[1:17:36] y'all hear what I'm saying I can't do
[1:17:38] what everybody else is doing
[1:17:40] oh come on somebody if I gotta goal by
[1:17:43] myself we sing that song Lord let me go
[1:17:46] by myself
[1:17:48] Hallelujah
[1:17:50] right so when Jesus in our day and I'm
[1:17:53] coming now
[1:17:54] turn the corner
[1:17:58] the devil was right there
[1:18:01] when those seals were opened people
[1:18:03] wanted to disbelieve it
[1:18:05] they want to say something was wrong
[1:18:08] with it
[1:18:09] but let me tell you something
[1:18:11] is living in me
[1:18:13] and the more I read this word and that
[1:18:15] message I put that I don't look for to
[1:18:18] see
[1:18:19] some type of brother Branham forgive me
[1:18:21] for say like this you know what I look
[1:18:23] for me
[1:18:26] I'm looking for me
[1:18:29] this is an invisible Union
[1:18:32] the word comes to unite with you
[1:18:35] it comes to your night with me so when
[1:18:37] I'm reading it I'm looking in it for me
[1:18:41] I need to know what I'm supposed to do
[1:18:44] for my day
[1:18:46] somebody help me here
[1:18:48] and looking back is not going to help me
[1:18:52] let me say it like this the preview of
[1:18:54] the Bride she was on with Christian
[1:18:56] Soldier marching as the wall in other
[1:18:59] words she was in a battle
[1:19:03] but she was marching to what the tune of
[1:19:05] the word
[1:19:06] and as she marched forward guess what
[1:19:09] she began to step higher
[1:19:12] translation began to happen somebody
[1:19:15] help me she was being she was literally
[1:19:18] being pulled from this Dimension to the
[1:19:21] next
[1:19:22] just because she was following the word
[1:19:26] but listen what she was following
[1:19:29] Calvary the crucified oh my God the
[1:19:33] blood
[1:19:35] marching onto wall with the cross of
[1:19:38] Jesus going on before
[1:19:41] is that right is that right the prophet
[1:19:45] God said listen
[1:19:46] I've taken you as far as I could take
[1:19:48] you
[1:19:49] I can't take you no further
[1:19:58] but he says see those bloody footprints
[1:20:01] you follow those bloody footprints
[1:20:04] they'll take you all away
[1:20:07] Prince the blood and
[1:20:10] bloody of the son of man
[1:20:12] the word of the hour will take you if
[1:20:15] you don't have to worry about it
[1:20:17] changing you it will change you
[1:20:20] if you are truly elect chosen of God it
[1:20:24] will change you
[1:20:29] Hallelujah
[1:20:32] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:20:34] how did he call to be consecrated
[1:20:37] he said wherefore
[1:20:38] holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly
[1:20:41] calling consider the Apostle and high
[1:20:43] priest of our profession Christ Jesus
[1:20:46] huh a Heavenly calling a calling that
[1:20:49] Celestial calling
[1:20:52] listen it's the truth even when I was a
[1:20:54] boy I knew I was different
[1:20:57] wasn't even saved
[1:21:00] or the revelation of it anyway
[1:21:03] but I knew I was different
[1:21:05] I was the black sheep of my family
[1:21:08] but I knew God was real
[1:21:11] I knew the name of the Lord was the Lord
[1:21:13] Jesus Christ
[1:21:15] I knew that there was one God and not
[1:21:16] three
[1:21:18] no Seminary taught me that
[1:21:21] it was God
[1:21:23] I heard his voice when I was being
[1:21:25] baptized even in the Baptist Church
[1:21:28] when Reverend fail said I baptized you
[1:21:30] the name of the father and of the Son
[1:21:31] and the Holy Ghost when I came up out of
[1:21:34] the water I heard God's voice for the
[1:21:36] first time he said and what is the name
[1:21:41] and I carried that question in my heart
[1:21:43] for years because I didn't understand it
[1:21:47] Hallelujah but one day I was up at
[1:21:51] Progressive I had she didn't mean to
[1:21:53] call that name but anyway Hallelujah
[1:21:59] I had already promised some people I was
[1:22:01] coming back to the service
[1:22:02] and while I was coming let me back it up
[1:22:05] because I sang with a group out there in
[1:22:07] the world a gospel group we were just
[1:22:09] Hypocrites so it's what we would do we
[1:22:11] would sing and we'd get on the radio and
[1:22:13] you know how they had on the television
[1:22:14] the gospel program and we'll do that on
[1:22:17] a Friday night and after the Friday
[1:22:18] night we go to the fountain blue
[1:22:22] the club yeah yes
[1:22:25] I would feel convicted
[1:22:28] everybody else carrying their little
[1:22:30] mini bottles but I'm just saying
[1:22:33] and I used to sing this song Thank God
[1:22:35] I've been saved thank God I've been
[1:22:38] saved
[1:22:39] yeah and I'm like
[1:22:42] right I felt so so hip hip hypocritical
[1:22:47] because I didn't know what saved meant
[1:22:52] but there was a young lady and I won't
[1:22:54] call her name that I knew was a sinner
[1:22:56] but I saw her walking down the street
[1:22:58] with a long dress on and long sleeves
[1:23:00] and and she says oh come on up to the
[1:23:03] church on the hill
[1:23:06] my mama told me about that church my
[1:23:09] mama told me I would be saved there
[1:23:12] because y'all don't know the background
[1:23:13] of it the week before I got saved
[1:23:16] I drank myself almost to death
[1:23:19] and death came in that room
[1:23:21] and I promised God if you saved me from
[1:23:24] this
[1:23:25] anybody know what I'm talking about when
[1:23:28] death comes out you know it's death
[1:23:31] and I said Lord if you if you would if
[1:23:33] you'd not let me die right now I promise
[1:23:35] you I'll be saying next week
[1:23:40] people thought I hadn't lost my mind
[1:23:42] Hallelujah
[1:23:44] because when I went up there and I
[1:23:46] walked through that yard I heard that
[1:23:47] voice that spoke to me when I was a boy
[1:23:49] at 12 he says be commandment be thou
[1:23:53] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:55] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:23:57] and I said yes Lord I went down in the
[1:24:01] back a bottom part brother Simmons I
[1:24:04] don't think he remembered this part but
[1:24:06] I remember it because when I saw brother
[1:24:09] Simmons man I thought this guy was
[1:24:11] wicked
[1:24:13] dressing in white suits and them shiny
[1:24:16] shoes and you know them big hats
[1:24:19] and every time I look around he had
[1:24:21] women around him
[1:24:25] that's when I would see you
[1:24:30] I just I'm telling you I really thought
[1:24:32] he was pushing something you know
[1:24:36] and I saw brother Simmons and I said if
[1:24:38] God can save you
[1:24:40] I know he could save me
[1:24:46] it's the truth
[1:24:48] that's my experience and he was standing
[1:24:51] there and the Poo was already open and
[1:24:54] everything I don't know how all that
[1:24:56] came to pass but I told him I want to be
[1:24:58] baptized he said you understand it I
[1:25:00] said yes sir
[1:25:02] and when they baptized me in the name of
[1:25:04] the Lord Jesus Christ you don't have to
[1:25:06] believe this but this is my witness this
[1:25:08] is what I believe this is what I saw
[1:25:09] when I came up out of the water I felt
[1:25:12] squeaky clean I felt light as a feather
[1:25:14] but just like life almost like this but
[1:25:16] if it's far more many far more of them
[1:25:19] all on the walls and I'm screaming look
[1:25:22] at those lies look at those lights now I
[1:25:25] don't know whether they heard me
[1:25:27] screaming but I know I was screaming it
[1:25:29] I don't know whether it was all
[1:25:31] Supernatural what but I know what was
[1:25:33] happening to me
[1:25:34] and when I came home everybody thought I
[1:25:37] was crazy
[1:25:39] this guy
[1:25:41] Who Loved To Party
[1:25:43] who love to drink and all that I never
[1:25:45] was a smoker but you know
[1:25:48] and they saw I had done change
[1:25:51] and my brother-in-law said oh he ain't
[1:25:53] changed
[1:25:54] and one day after service he came he had
[1:25:56] a and I've got to get back to the
[1:25:58] message but anyway after service he had
[1:26:00] a big a Colt 45 I hope this is all right
[1:26:02] Lord but I want you to understand
[1:26:04] because that was one of my favorites
[1:26:07] so he thought he was going to tempt me
[1:26:09] and here it was the can was sweating
[1:26:11] y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:26:15] Hallelujah
[1:26:19] there was no temptation at all
[1:26:24] when God took it from me he took it from
[1:26:27] me
[1:26:28] that's the kind of holy ghost that lives
[1:26:31] today God knows how to sanctify you and
[1:26:36] God knows how to fill you with the Holy
[1:26:38] Ghost
[1:26:38] but you got to have a made-up mind
[1:26:42] Hallelujah
[1:26:44] Hallelujah I know this is Wednesday
[1:26:46] night so I've got to hurry just call to
[1:26:49] be consecrated
[1:26:50] the calling of the Lord is not based on
[1:26:54] on on uh
[1:26:56] anybody calling you
[1:26:59] you know it's based upon his calling you
[1:27:01] right
[1:27:02] and you know he uses the unlikely person
[1:27:06] a person who who in the world don't even
[1:27:09] want
[1:27:11] those are the kind of people God loved
[1:27:13] to work with
[1:27:15] Hallelujah is that right
[1:27:18] it doesn't matter what others think of
[1:27:20] you the calling is not Earthly it is
[1:27:23] Heavenly
[1:27:25] the call of Jeremiah the call of Josiah
[1:27:28] the woman at the well though he was a
[1:27:31] man it was a different calling
[1:27:34] she's her she had her had her no man we
[1:27:37] don't know how many times she had me and
[1:27:39] calling her but this man had a different
[1:27:41] call Hallelujah and this call took the
[1:27:45] filth out of her life and brought in
[1:27:48] purity
[1:27:49] brought in holiness
[1:27:51] it was the Turning of a Life by a voice
[1:27:56] y'all hear what I'm saying it was the
[1:27:58] change it was the Turning of a Life by a
[1:28:01] voice now you say well brother was wild
[1:28:03] did you use the term or use the
[1:28:05] scripture Moses is dead
[1:28:08] because when the scriptures were open
[1:28:10] when the Sears were open
[1:28:12] it put us back in the time of the Garden
[1:28:14] of Eden
[1:28:16] and all Adam and Eve ever had was The
[1:28:19] Voice
[1:28:24] the voice of God walked in the cool of
[1:28:28] the evening
[1:28:29] y'all hear what I'm saying now we're
[1:28:31] back to the voice of God
[1:28:34] Hallelujah and if we are he's the
[1:28:38] shepherd and we're the Sheep he leads us
[1:28:41] he guides us
[1:28:44] Hallelujah
[1:28:45] even David said no yea though I walk
[1:28:48] through the valley the shadow of death I
[1:28:50] will fear no evil that's a powerful
[1:28:52] scripture Psalms 30 or 23 is powerful he
[1:28:57] prepares the table before me in the
[1:28:59] presence of my enemy God purposely does
[1:29:02] it
[1:29:03] while he's building your character oh
[1:29:06] don't you ever say Lord I want to be
[1:29:07] just like you if you
[1:29:10] I didn't really mean it prepare
[1:29:13] Hallelujah because he's going to do just
[1:29:16] what you ask him to do and trials are
[1:29:18] going to come tests are going to come
[1:29:21] everything is going to come your way but
[1:29:23] you know what he's looking for Out of
[1:29:25] You Lord not my will but thine be done
[1:29:28] he want praise
[1:29:31] even when you're going through trials
[1:29:33] even when you're going through tests
[1:29:36] Hallelujah let me say it like this and
[1:29:39] I'm gonna close in just a bit
[1:29:42] time of the higher calling
[1:29:43] Mary and Martha had seen so many things
[1:29:46] Jesus had done
[1:29:49] and they knew
[1:29:51] he could raise Lazarus from the dead
[1:29:54] and Jesus knew God knew that but see God
[1:29:56] put them in a
[1:29:58] terrible place
[1:30:00] this is what I say terrible
[1:30:02] because now he's asking them to believe
[1:30:04] something
[1:30:06] that never ever has been done throughout
[1:30:08] history
[1:30:10] he's literally puts them in a position
[1:30:13] that either faith is going to kick in
[1:30:16] our faith is not
[1:30:18] and you've got to understand amen the
[1:30:20] voice of God traveled from Mary to
[1:30:23] Martha come see Jesus is here Hallelujah
[1:30:27] and what happened
[1:30:29] let me ask you a question
[1:30:32] because this is what God shared to
[1:30:33] shared with me
[1:30:35] to a True Believer no circumstance
[1:30:39] become hopeless
[1:30:44] I'm gonna say it again to a True
[1:30:46] Believer
[1:30:47] no circumstance become hopeless
[1:30:52] he proved it
[1:30:54] he took Mary and Martha here is a man
[1:30:57] dead for four days
[1:31:01] and he said if you believe it
[1:31:03] you'll see that I am the resurrection
[1:31:07] Hallelujah you understand me roll away
[1:31:12] the stone whatever unbelief you have
[1:31:15] roll it away
[1:31:17] there's something you've got to do
[1:31:20] to get to that place to have the kind of
[1:31:22] faith Hallelujah that even Mary and
[1:31:25] Martha had can you imagine a man dead
[1:31:28] and rotten and stinking and God said
[1:31:30] he's going to live
[1:31:33] and we look at situations in our lives
[1:31:36] that's not even near as bad
[1:31:38] and we struggle
[1:31:41] God help us
[1:31:42] you hear what I'm saying God took Mary
[1:31:45] and Martha to what I call the ultimate
[1:31:49] the ultimate of life where man has been
[1:31:53] dead everybody know he's dead
[1:31:56] full of worms
[1:32:01] but God had something there
[1:32:04] because God could have said open up the
[1:32:06] open it up I'm gonna let you see him no
[1:32:09] no no the focus
[1:32:11] was not on Lazarus
[1:32:13] the focus was on Jesus
[1:32:16] I am
[1:32:18] the resurrection
[1:32:19] if you believe on me
[1:32:22] you will see y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:32:24] it wasn't on his sickness
[1:32:27] it wasn't on his condition
[1:32:29] y'all hear what I'm saying it was on
[1:32:32] Jesus
[1:32:33] who do you say this son of man am
[1:32:38] and what we need to stop doing is
[1:32:41] focusing
[1:32:43] oh conditions
[1:32:45] and focus on the promise if God says so
[1:32:49] that's exactly what he means Hallelujah
[1:32:52] he didn't say how long we must wait but
[1:32:55] I'm like Joe I'm going to wait till my
[1:32:58] change come I'm not going to interfere
[1:33:01] with God's program I'm going to believe
[1:33:03] God
[1:33:07] the calling is high
[1:33:10] and I'm gonna come to this
[1:33:15] trust in the Lord
[1:33:18] with all your heart
[1:33:21] and lean not to your own understanding
[1:33:25] in all your ways
[1:33:27] acknowledge Him
[1:33:29] and he shall direct yeah
[1:33:34] right
[1:33:35] it is God who's doing the building
[1:33:38] he is the part and we are the clay
[1:33:41] you know it's like we have things happen
[1:33:43] to us and we're like oh my God why me
[1:33:46] think about it you you thinking in the
[1:33:49] wrong way
[1:33:50] God has chosen you
[1:33:57] he chose job
[1:34:01] he chooses you
[1:34:03] for certain circumstances and certain
[1:34:06] trials
[1:34:08] but we need to do to adapt the job
[1:34:11] attitude
[1:34:12] the lord giveth
[1:34:14] you see because we've got to stop the
[1:34:16] devil for having any kind of leave way
[1:34:20] we can't give him nothing
[1:34:22] don't give him just not even a speck of
[1:34:24] unbelief
[1:34:26] block him
[1:34:27] and how do you block him by praising God
[1:34:31] thanking God for the condition thanking
[1:34:34] God for everything he's doing right now
[1:34:36] because you know he's God
[1:34:41] that's what I've learned
[1:34:45] I learned that everything I suffer is is
[1:34:47] a reason there's a purpose everything I
[1:34:49] go through is a purpose there's a reason
[1:34:52] and whether I see all of the purpose or
[1:34:54] see all all of his reasons I don't no no
[1:34:57] no but I'm here to worship
[1:35:00] I'm here to praise him in every
[1:35:02] condition you know up on the mountain
[1:35:04] down in the valley Jerusalem is my home
[1:35:06] that's what I'm talking about
[1:35:09] we need to stop allowing Satan to to
[1:35:12] move us like we're out in the outer
[1:35:14] Court you know what I mean are we out
[1:35:16] there with the rain and everything the
[1:35:18] weather is going to affect my faith it
[1:35:20] ain't affecting me
[1:35:22] because that's not where I'm living
[1:35:24] he said if you abide in me and my word
[1:35:26] abide in you he said you could ask
[1:35:28] whatever you will the pro see the word
[1:35:31] can't lie
[1:35:32] the problem is we need to abide abide
[1:35:35] abide abide in it stay in the word
[1:35:40] how do we used to sing that song we
[1:35:41] understand the word till Jesus come
[1:35:44] stay there stay there
[1:35:47] then Jesus come y'all know how we should
[1:35:49] say
[1:35:53] get in the word and stay there that's it
[1:35:55] be ready when Jesus come oh we used to
[1:35:57] tear that one up
[1:36:00] I'm almost done
[1:36:02] I keep saying that but this is my last
[1:36:03] scripture
[1:36:05] second Timothy
[1:36:07] one
[1:36:10] and nine I'll close on this
[1:36:15] who have saved us
[1:36:18] and called us
[1:36:21] with the Holy calling
[1:36:24] not according to our works
[1:36:27] but according to his own purpose and
[1:36:29] Grace
[1:36:30] kick the devil out of your mind
[1:36:33] Lord not according to our works
[1:36:37] he ain't looking at your works
[1:36:40] he want to see your faith in him
[1:36:43] according to his purpose huh let me read
[1:36:47] that again
[1:36:48] who have saved us and called us with a
[1:36:52] holy calling
[1:36:54] the only Holy One is God
[1:36:57] calling not according to our words
[1:37:00] but according to his own purpose and
[1:37:02] Grace it will always be that
[1:37:06] always be that
[1:37:09] always be that
[1:37:11] Peter denied him three times
[1:37:14] but it's God's purpose
[1:37:16] God saw that and God Peter was still the
[1:37:19] spokesman on the day of Pentecost
[1:37:21] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:37:25] Abraham look what all he did
[1:37:27] and he still was the father of Nations
[1:37:31] think about it
[1:37:32] Peter murder in his mind in his heart he
[1:37:35] was until God saved him until he got the
[1:37:38] Holy Ghost
[1:37:39] he tried to kill that Soldier
[1:37:42] hey somebody come on but God had a plan
[1:37:46] for him
[1:37:48] did God take all of that evil mean stuff
[1:37:51] out of Peter absolutely
[1:37:54] so much so Peter was able to write about
[1:37:56] the divine nature of God
[1:37:59] oh God is good amen
[1:38:02] I call it on purpose which was given us
[1:38:05] in Christ Jesus what before the world
[1:38:09] began and that's where you get the devil
[1:38:12] you got to tell him this ain't no new
[1:38:14] thing
[1:38:15] what God has done for me was done for me
[1:38:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:20] and he made me Victorious
[1:38:23] Hallelujah yeah is that right Paul said
[1:38:26] he causes us to Triumph
[1:38:29] I love that scripture because the devil
[1:38:32] don't want you to quote that to him he
[1:38:34] wants you to make you make you feel like
[1:38:35] you're the loser right no as long as
[1:38:39] you're in Christ
[1:38:41] you could never be the loser
[1:38:43] but people of God in closing
[1:38:46] ask God lord how can I be more
[1:38:48] consecrated
[1:38:51] Lord increase my prayer life increase my
[1:38:54] way of studying
[1:38:56] and Lord don't let me read the Bible
[1:38:58] like a a newspaper
[1:39:01] but I want you to speak to me through
[1:39:03] that word
[1:39:04] talk to me personally Lord you are alive
[1:39:08] and I want I want I want to have that
[1:39:10] kind of relationship that fellowship
[1:39:12] with you Lord
[1:39:14] on a daily basis not every week but on a
[1:39:17] daily basis throughout the day and
[1:39:19] whenever you put on my heart to pray
[1:39:21] give me Grace to bow my knees give me
[1:39:25] Grace to pray or wherever I might be
[1:39:27] Lord help me Jesus
[1:39:30] I've learned one thing to
[1:39:32] inquire of the Lord whenever I'm asked
[1:39:35] to do something sometimes I do forget
[1:39:38] even when it came to the funeral
[1:39:41] I didn't ask God but then the Holy
[1:39:43] Spirit brought to my attention you
[1:39:45] didn't you didn't ask
[1:39:46] I asked the Lord for forgiveness
[1:39:49] I'm in training
[1:39:51] he's teaching me
[1:39:53] to acknowledge Him in all my ways
[1:39:56] I want him to direct my path
[1:39:59] you see I don't want to leave me I don't
[1:40:01] want to leave myself I need his Shepherd
[1:40:03] you I need him to guide me to teach me I
[1:40:06] need him to take me where you know what
[1:40:09] one thing I do not question on whether
[1:40:11] I'm bride or not somebody said you'll
[1:40:14] never know where the Bible said make
[1:40:15] your calling an election sure
[1:40:18] you can know that
[1:40:20] and when you know that you know that you
[1:40:23] become invincible
[1:40:25] you may be a child like David but you
[1:40:28] steal a giant slayer
[1:40:30] even in your youth
[1:40:32] so understand by the grace of God the
[1:40:34] power that God has invested in us he
[1:40:37] wants to see it used he wants to see it
[1:40:40] on display let's stand
