[28:07] with brother andy brother thaddeus and
[28:09] different ones
[28:11] burgess family they sent their regards
[28:14] so by the grace of god we were there in

[28:51] brother gordon was actually a high
[28:53] disservice where the early sex man had a
[28:54] service you know
[28:56] i just thought i'd go and just
[28:59] not let anybody know i was coming
[29:02] and i just slept in sunday morning
[29:05] and i brother andy
[29:07] preached that sunday morning and asked
[29:08] me will i
[29:09] do the afternoon service
[29:11] so we were able to minister that
[29:13] afternoon i hadn't ministered there in
[29:15] years
[29:16] nevertheless he asked me to preach
[29:18] easter meeting for them
[29:20] and i couldn't do it so much too much
[29:22] was going on here
[29:24] so i told him i couldn't come
[29:26] so i thought i don't have to go by there
[29:29] just when you're asking me to preach
[29:32] but you know i like to go visit people
[29:35] even if i'm not ministering let me just
[29:38] go
[29:38] and
[29:39] see your friends see your fellow
[29:41] brothers
[29:42] and sisters amen
[29:45] so by the grace of god
[29:46] anyway we ministered that sunday night
[29:49] and
[29:51] the presence of god came down in
[29:54] in in a supernatural way and
[29:56] the people were
[29:58] you know it was just
[29:59] they couldn't leave out the presence
[30:02] it they just sat and
[30:05] they were daddies came up to lead songs
[30:08] and the musicians everybody got spelled
[30:10] by and the holy ghost was
[30:12] just all over the church
[30:14] tongues interpretation
[30:16] and just the presence of god which is
[30:20] i was putting it close to the level that
[30:23] when we're in
[30:24] south africa and how the presidency got
[30:27] just settled
[30:28] in the place
[30:30] and um so
[30:32] we
[30:33] it's so much they were telling me so
[30:35] many so much supernatural took place
[30:38] till i just
[30:39] sat down and just i was just listening
[30:41] and they would
[30:42] well can you do money tuesday wednesday
[30:45] no no no no no no
[30:47] i just i just take a little break a
[30:50] little break but can you come back can
[30:52] you come back and run run revive what
[30:54] can you do i said well the lord knows
[30:58] just let me let me just come down for a
[31:00] little bit but
[31:01] ask you to continue
[31:03] pray for us and pray for them
[31:06] and um just try to give you just a
[31:08] little synopsis a little report but by
[31:12] the grace of god let's just keep praying
[31:14] the same god is
[31:15] everywhere
[31:16] god is moving god is blessing so
[31:20] um
[31:22] i told him just a little simple message
[31:24] we shared on friday here
[31:27] i was on that same line
[31:30] but something supernatural happened
[31:32] saturday night while i was in the hotel
[31:34] and i got up that morning
[31:36] and i was telling caleb about it
[31:39] and then
[31:40] and showing off
[31:42] what i was telling him about
[31:44] i was i was listening to a conversation
[31:49] and there was some ministers and i was
[31:52] listening to them talk
[31:53] every now and then that happened to me
[31:56] and i said
[31:57] caleb
[31:59] you know what happened
[32:00] some hours before i got up i said
[32:05] i'm so i'm here
[32:07] laying down listening to
[32:09] people talk about me
[32:12] i said and i'm hearing him clear
[32:16] i say oh okay
[32:18] and she'll know her father
[32:21] that you said
[32:22] brother simmons
[32:24] it's just what you heard i said exactly
[32:30] he said somebody was talking about you
[32:33] i said
[32:35] and i kind of shared that with them
[32:38] that i was to listen
[32:40] and every now and then those type things
[32:42] happen
[32:43] and sometimes sometimes they happen
[32:46] often sometimes you just
[32:48] don't have so that was
[32:51] one thing that was
[32:52] so amazing and so supernatural
[32:55] and that
[32:57] he knew he knew immediately when i said
[33:00] that i heard
[33:02] some ministers and it was
[33:05] satan and i heard what they were saying
[33:09] and you know it's striking how
[33:12] god could come on the scene and do
[33:14] things
[33:15] in the midst of people
[33:18] and um
[33:19] god bless you now i better get out the
[33:21] way i might talk too much ernie's got a
[33:23] minister tonight but god is good let's
[33:25] just keep praying keep trusting god
[33:28] and i said god will
[33:31] it's nothing that god would not do for
[33:33] you
[33:34] and i and i believe that i'm waiting to
[33:37] hear further testimonies from what god
[33:40] did in that kind of presence because
[33:43] in the presence when god's presence come
[33:46] down
[33:47] anything can happen
[33:48] healings miracles that people don't even
[33:51] know about two days later they didn't
[33:53] well god did this for me
[33:56] you know god did that for me
[33:59] it was something about the sermon some
[34:00] things i said a sister was saying to her
[34:05] daddy just said
[34:06] her and her hug she was saying for
[34:08] weeks and months almost the lord had put
[34:12] some of those things and her husband was
[34:14] just talking about it she was telling
[34:16] the lord was dealing with me on that
[34:19] particular
[34:20] sermon and that's the words that i was
[34:23] saying
[34:24] and
[34:25] and it just
[34:27] it just caused people just to know that
[34:29] god was dealing with them too
[34:31] and know that god is speaking to them
[34:33] may god bless you let us sing that song

[37:29] we want to look at the book of saint
[37:31] john by god's grace
[37:33] saint john 10.
[37:49] try not to hold you alone
[37:52] saint john 10 and
[37:54] we'll begin at the first verse
[37:56] you got to say amen
[37:58] and it reads
[38:00] verily verily i say unto you he that
[38:02] enter
[38:03] not by the door into the sheepfold but
[38:06] climbeth up some other way the same as a
[38:08] thief and a robber but he that entereth
[38:11] into in by the door
[38:13] is the shepherd of the sheep
[38:16] to him the porter openeth
[38:18] and the sheep hear his voice and he
[38:21] called his own sheep by name
[38:24] and leadeth them out and when he put
[38:26] forth his own sheep he goes before them
[38:30] and the sheep follow him for they know
[38:32] his voice and a stranger they will not
[38:34] follow but will flee from him for they
[38:37] know
[38:38] not the voice of strangers may god has
[38:41] blessed to the reading of his word you
[38:42] may be seated
[38:44] tonight by god's grace just for a moment
[38:47] i want to minister to you on a little
[38:49] topic and you know i ministered on it
[38:51] about a week or so ago
[38:53] and i i entitled it the voice amen
[38:57] the voice
[38:58] you know
[38:59] here you know the scriptures declaring
[39:01] that jesus was declaring here he says
[39:04] you know
[39:05] the shepherd he entered he entered then
[39:08] by the porter and the porter opened up
[39:09] to him and he said in his sheep hear his
[39:11] voice and he called us his own sheep by
[39:14] name
[39:15] and he leaded them out you know it's
[39:17] something about
[39:19] you know the voice of god
[39:21] and and the call
[39:23] like he says he called them by name
[39:25] it's something about you know so
[39:29] sometimes you don't understand
[39:31] where you're going at or where you was
[39:32] where you're moving or what particularly
[39:35] drew you but
[39:37] one it had to be a certain point in your
[39:39] life to where you hear that voice and
[39:42] what did that voice do that voice begin
[39:44] to draw you
[39:46] i like how it says here he says at the
[39:48] shepherd he says he knows his sheep by
[39:50] name come on
[39:52] god knows your name
[39:54] says he called them not only does he
[39:56] call them but the bible here declares
[39:58] that he leadeth them out
[40:00] you know god when god calls a man he
[40:04] don't just call him and just leave him
[40:06] out there like that but he leads that
[40:08] man come on and sometimes you don't
[40:11] understand like it says you don't
[40:13] understand where you're going but
[40:15] nevertheless that voice that same voice
[40:17] that calls you is the same voice that's
[40:19] going to lead you
[40:21] and actually like it says here in the
[40:22] scriptures that the sheep he says that
[40:25] they they follow the shepherd come on he
[40:27] says they know his voice and a stranger
[40:29] they will not follow
[40:31] so what do we find you know even today i
[40:34] says that all over the land
[40:36] what's happening is the voice of god is
[40:39] going out come on through the ministry
[40:42] through whatever the lord uh intends to
[40:44] use but nevertheless the voice of god is
[40:47] going out and what is it is we we don't
[40:50] look many times as to say as calling
[40:52] groups
[40:53] but it's calling individuals
[40:55] it's calling those by name and we saw
[40:59] that on many cases or many uh uh uh
[41:02] circumstances
[41:04] that god he never lost one come on
[41:07] but he knows the bible says them that
[41:09] are his
[41:11] so in in knowing that resting assurance
[41:14] of that that hey he never lost one
[41:17] and he showed us that
[41:19] over and over again that no matter where
[41:22] that individual were no matter where
[41:25] where what kind of condition they were
[41:27] in or what had them bound when he called
[41:30] their name they had to come forth
[41:33] look at even in the natural
[41:35] lazarus being locked up in the tomb amen
[41:38] but when god called his name what
[41:40] happened not even the chains of death
[41:42] could hold him could it
[41:44] you know he even says in one place i
[41:46] like how it stirred me up how he says
[41:49] lose some and let him go come on
[41:51] i says what it is we look at so many
[41:54] times in individuals how the devil had
[41:58] had individuals lives abound and had
[42:02] shackles or grips and strongholds on
[42:04] people but there's no grip and i'm a
[42:07] firm believer of that there's no grill
[42:09] there's no stronghold that the devil can
[42:12] have on your life tonight
[42:14] that when that voice of god begins to
[42:16] call you
[42:17] that it won't it won't have no other
[42:19] choice but to let go
[42:21] all it takes is you hearing that voice
[42:24] i was praying i said lord uh give us
[42:26] ears to hear lord to hear what you're
[42:29] saying you know we're living in the
[42:30] darkest hour ever known right
[42:33] says in in this age all it wouldn't be
[42:36] no light it would be a total darkness
[42:39] right
[42:40] and in the midst of that total darkness
[42:42] you know when you look when you think
[42:43] about darkness you can't see your way
[42:46] i got up even last night and in the room
[42:48] and walking and you know you just
[42:50] couldn't couldn't see and i was thinking
[42:52] about that walking and tripping over
[42:54] everything about the fall just to go a
[42:56] few feet
[42:57] why because you couldn't see
[42:59] and you think about in the hour that we
[43:01] live in the darkness i said it's so dark
[43:04] you can't even go a few feet without him
[43:06] leading you you can't make it nowhere
[43:09] without god leading you come on and what
[43:11] it is you says what am i following i'm
[43:13] following that voice
[43:15] that which is calling me come on i'm
[43:18] heeding the call i said he knows you by
[43:20] name come on
[43:21] he called you he said that's that
[43:23] shepherd he know he i know my sheep by
[43:26] name
[43:27] and i call him and i'm gonna lead him
[43:29] out come on i said how are you gonna
[43:31] make it out of this hour how are you
[43:32] gonna make it out of the condition of
[43:34] the world today god is gonna have to
[43:36] lead you out i find myself even now all
[43:40] the time praying saying lord lead me
[43:43] lead me lord come on and i'll follow
[43:46] why because god i don't know where i'm
[43:48] going i asked the lord even when it
[43:50] comes down to raising children i was on
[43:52] my knees yesterday i said god i don't
[43:54] know how to handle situations i don't
[43:57] know what to do god and you see
[43:59] sometimes them growing up and going on i
[44:01] said lord i need your leadership
[44:04] i said god lead me
[44:06] because you can't get it all figured out
[44:08] you can't protect them you can't put a
[44:10] bubble around them come on and all those
[44:12] things but if the blood is applied come
[44:14] on
[44:16] and that's what we're depending on come
[44:17] on
[44:18] the blood of jesus christ
[44:20] to cover them come on and i said lord
[44:23] lead me how many want the lord to lead
[44:25] them tonight
[44:26] but i said what it is it's the voice
[44:28] come on i like that and i'll just just
[44:31] just dwell dwell on that so much he says
[44:34] you know in in many scriptures
[44:36] especially i think the psalms 29 talking
[44:38] about the voice of the lord and how
[44:41] powerful the voice of the lord is and
[44:43] how it breaks cedars and how it breaks
[44:45] come on i said the voice of the lord it
[44:47] breaks yokes
[44:49] it breaks strongholds come on what do we
[44:52] need tonight we need the voice of god
[44:54] what do we need in our homes we need the
[44:56] voice of god what do we need in our
[44:58] everyday lives we need the voice of the
[45:00] lord come on to do what lead us out
[45:03] hallelujah do you believe that tonight
[45:06] i says what it is his voice is something
[45:09] about the voice of god the voice of god
[45:12] has drawn abilities
[45:14] you know i was thinking about a friend
[45:15] of mine and the lord just recently saved
[45:18] him and how
[45:19] you know was talking with him and it's
[45:22] something about how encouraging it is to
[45:25] talk to him because he's sharing things
[45:28] with me encouraging me of what the lord
[45:30] has been doing for him and i says what
[45:32] it is i could have witnessed to him all
[45:34] with every breath that's in me but it
[45:36] wouldn't have did no good sometimes
[45:39] but all it took is the voice of the lord
[45:41] to be again calling them he might can't
[45:43] explain to you what happened to him but
[45:45] all he know is one day his heart began
[45:48] to turn
[45:49] and that's what i pray even here tonight
[45:51] come on sometimes we we struggle and do
[45:54] all our best to try to win people but i
[45:56] said lord let their heart begin to turn
[45:59] do something in their spirit and their
[46:01] heart begin to turn and when their heart
[46:04] begins to turn you watch god in those
[46:06] drawing abilities
[46:07] all we do is do what preach the gospel
[46:10] live the life let that voice go out
[46:13] hallelujah and i believe that voice will
[46:15] draw them they might not even know
[46:17] what's taking place even on the inside
[46:19] of them but they know that they're
[46:21] coming forth hallelujah
[46:23] oh jesus but i believe that in order for
[46:26] them to hear that voice come on they had
[46:29] to be predestinated and ordained of god
[46:32] and god began calling on them hallelujah
[46:35] but somewhere in their heart i believe
[46:37] they always had a desire
[46:39] just to be saved and a desire to live
[46:42] for god but situations sometimes hands
[46:46] are life and the way they were born
[46:48] sometimes had them bound but
[46:51] nevertheless that didn't stop the
[46:53] election of god
[46:54] hallelujah how could he write their name
[46:57] there how could he write your name there
[46:59] because he already knew what was in you
[47:02] he knew the seed that he planted inside
[47:04] of you so wherever you were hallelujah
[47:07] god sought you out
[47:09] he began to call you where art thou
[47:11] hallelujah
[47:12] oh jesus
[47:14] and you heard that voice didn't you come
[47:16] on i believe that how many believe that
[47:18] tonight let's look at romans 8 by god's
[47:21] grace
[47:22] i said the voice come on the voice it
[47:25] has
[47:26] eight and 28 it has drawn abilities and
[47:29] i said abilities and that's no matter
[47:31] what uh condition that person is in you
[47:34] know it's something about it's just
[47:36] those little things i i begin to look
[47:39] over you know as a deep call to the deep
[47:42] come on
[47:43] it's something down in the deep
[47:47] uh uh
[47:48] behind be a ponder beyond all of the
[47:51] darkness
[47:52] beyond all of the other noise
[47:55] and the clutter
[47:57] that might be around your life
[47:59] nevertheless when that deep began to
[48:01] call
[48:02] it's got abilities to reach beyond all
[48:04] that clutter come on
[48:06] reach beyond you and you know how that
[48:09] deep call does i think about moses
[48:11] though you know he might have been next
[48:13] in line to be pharaoh but there's
[48:15] something about it the bible says he
[48:17] refused to be called the son of
[48:19] pharaoh's daughter didn't he come on
[48:21] but he chose rather to suffer the
[48:23] affliction of god rather to enjoy the
[48:26] bible says the pleasures of sin for a
[48:28] season what can make moses give it up
[48:32] come on
[48:33] what would make him
[48:35] turn around and forsake all
[48:37] and fall after christ
[48:39] the voice hallelujah something on the
[48:42] inside it was a deep calling
[48:45] he was yearning for something better
[48:47] than what this life had to offer and i
[48:49] said even tonight what do we have to do
[48:52] it's something inside of us
[48:54] yearning
[48:55] for something better than what this life
[48:57] got to offer you know many times what
[48:59] the devil does he put all kind of things
[49:01] before you don't he
[49:03] all kind of opportunities
[49:05] like they say come on
[49:07] things and ways to make more money and
[49:09] get more gain in this life
[49:12] but that deep call come on
[49:14] something is calling out people look at
[49:16] you sometimes and say you crazy and all
[49:18] these things and you passing away
[49:20] passing up but you've given these things
[49:23] up because you know that there's a
[49:25] better something out there come on
[49:27] there's something else calling you
[49:30] drawing you out how many believe that
[49:32] tonight what it is it's the voice of god
[49:35] when you begin to hear that voice you
[49:37] say here i am lord speak
[49:39] let me know what you want out of my life
[49:41] all i want to do god is your will how
[49:44] many want the will of god tonight
[49:46] but i said that voice come on
[49:48] what it is
[49:50] calling i believe that you know i'm so
[49:52] stirred that's why it says no matter
[49:54] we've seen that proven many times no
[49:56] matter what condition a person was in
[49:58] come on
[50:00] god god had a way of going by and
[50:02] getting those that are his
[50:04] god had a way of swooping like he says
[50:07] he had need to go by that way
[50:09] god god saw a need why he saw his seed
[50:12] and he wasn't going to lose not one so
[50:14] he had a need in his eye he had to go by
[50:17] that way hallelujah he had to deviate
[50:20] sometimes they looked like from the path
[50:22] they was on i got to go by that way why
[50:24] because there's one over there i got to
[50:25] get hallelujah
[50:27] oh jesus i'm so glad he deviated to come
[50:30] get me
[50:31] how many believe that tonight aren't you
[50:33] glad that god saw need one day to come
[50:35] by and see about you
[50:38] in your condition when you might ain't
[50:40] even been thinking about him but he
[50:42] heard your hearts cry hallelujah he saw
[50:44] a seed there god recognized you oh jesus
[50:49] when he saw you he recognized you i'm
[50:51] glad god recognized me oh jesus
[50:55] hallelujah i'm so glad that god knew my
[50:58] name
[50:59] and called me and i heard that voice
[51:01] say how did you come forth i heard that
[51:03] voice
[51:04] i heard him call me one day hallelujah
[51:07] and that's when i was able to come forth
[51:09] how are you able to come forth tonight
[51:11] god calls you come on
[51:13] he called you by name
[51:15] how'd you get where you are he led you
[51:17] out how you gonna get to where he wants
[51:19] you to be he gonna lead you there
[51:21] hallelujah how many believe that tonight
[51:24] oh jesus
[51:26] divorce come on
[51:28] that says here in romans eight like i
[51:30] said you know it doesn't matter what it
[51:32] doesn't matter what condition
[51:34] uh
[51:35] the seat of god find themselves in come
[51:38] on it's something about god is going to
[51:40] get you where you need to be at
[51:43] and once we realize that
[51:45] that the battle that we're faced with
[51:48] come on you are already victorious
[51:50] he said uh you know you overcome the
[51:53] world because he already overcame it
[51:55] the battle that you fought that you
[51:57] fighting he already won for you come on
[52:00] all we do all we're doing we going
[52:02] through this life and we know that but
[52:04] we know that god has already won the
[52:06] battle
[52:07] for us so what are we doing we're
[52:09] praising god on our way how many how
[52:11] many believe that said romans 8 and 28
[52:15] is very familiar he says and we know
[52:18] come on
[52:19] that all things
[52:20] work together for what
[52:22] for the good to them that what love god
[52:26] and them that and them who are what
[52:28] called come on
[52:30] i said did you hear his voice
[52:33] come on
[52:35] once you hear that voice
[52:36] he said we know come on i can see paul
[52:40] uh here trying to encourage them because
[52:42] we got so many clouds of witnesses
[52:46] letting you know come on this ain't
[52:48] something that we hoping but we know
[52:50] hallelujah that all things is going to
[52:52] work together
[52:54] for the good of them that love god
[52:56] come on do we have to share that
[52:58] testimony
[52:59] come on we got so many of them we know
[53:01] that all things are going to work
[53:02] together
[53:03] god never failed not one time and he
[53:06] ain't gonna fail now
[53:08] when the odds was against them when it
[53:10] looks like all hope was lost come on
[53:13] god showed up didn't he
[53:15] he came to the rescue for them that he
[53:17] called
[53:18] and in the midst of of what looked like
[53:20] a mess in the whole world coming down on
[53:23] them come on it worked together for
[53:24] their good god took the mess and he did
[53:27] something graded out of it hallelujah oh
[53:30] it worked together didn't he say that
[53:33] to them that are called
[53:35] come on according to his what purpose
[53:38] for for whom he did for no he also did
[53:41] what predestinate
[53:44] and then he also called come on we're
[53:47] talking about the voice

[53:51] saying the other week god already knew

[57:49] in the house of god the dog though my
[57:51] heart wanted to worship i had weights
[57:54] that was holding me down but i remember
[57:56] talking to pastor simmons here one day
[57:58] in the in the office and and and he i
[58:01] began to tell him that how i had these
[58:03] weights on me and things that was
[58:05] holding me down and i was sorry for a
[58:07] lot of things that i had done in my life
[58:09] but i remember him having a little talk
[58:11] with me
[58:12] saying that
[58:13] you know
[58:14] god knew you was going to take that
[58:16] first smoke before you even took that
[58:17] first smoke
[58:19] god knew you was going to take that
[58:20] drink before you took that first drink
[58:22] god knew you was gonna lie cheating all
[58:25] these things before you even done it he
[58:27] says but even before that the lamb was
[58:30] already slain for you hallelujah
[58:32] and the blood was already said he said
