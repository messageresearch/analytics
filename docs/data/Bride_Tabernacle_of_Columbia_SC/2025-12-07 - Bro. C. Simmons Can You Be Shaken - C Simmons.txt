[music] Amen. How many happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning? Amen. This morning we'll turn to the book of Exodus. A very familiar scripture. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 14. And we're going to start at verse five. I believe was very familiar scripture. But it and it reads when you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled in the heart of Pharaoh and his servants were turned against the people. And they said, "Why have we done this that we have let Israel go from serving us?" And he made ready his chariot and took his people with him. And he took 600 chosen chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of them. And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel. And the children of Israel went out with a high hand. But the Egyptians pursued after them all the horses and the chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them in camping by the sea besides Pahhiro. Amen. before Baal Zephon. And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them, and they were sore afraid. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, and they said unto Moses, "Because there were were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Wherefore hast thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians, for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which ye will show to you today. For the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye sh ye shall see them again no more forever. The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. Amen. God bless the reading of this word. You may be seated. This morning, I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled, can you be shaken? Can you be shaken? Uh pastor said when in talking about faith and I thought about it and I said you know the children of Israel they got to the Red Sea and many of them start to question their faith. Many of them they they started to do the do the opposite of the psalm that we just s sung that they could they were wondering whether they could trust in God or not. Now they had just seen him deliver them from the Egyptians but they decided you know what this this Red Sea might be too big. They decided when they got there, this Red Sea might be insurmountable. I don't know if we can get out of this situation. &gt;&gt; But I wonder this morning, can your faith be shaken? &gt;&gt; Can you be shaken? Because when you have such a faith in God, nothing can shake you from your faith in God. That's why when someone comes to you and tell you something contrary to the word of God, you're not shaken. You're not stirred. It doesn't bother you because you have something that you can hold on to. You have something that you have your trust in that doesn't matter which way the wind bloweth or the wave listeth, you know that there's something that I'm standing on. And said, when your faith is so solid, it can't be shaken. It's like the story said, it's on a rock that I that I might have spoke on at another time. It's on a rock and it's something that can't be moved. Doesn't matter who comes and try to talk you out of your faith. You can't be talked out of it. You can't be persuaded to believe something other than that because you believe that God is real. And it may not it may not be their experience, but that's your experience. And you might not can tell everyone or know how to describe it, but you know inside of you that what I'm standing on is the truth. &gt;&gt; What I'm standing on, I have faith in it and I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; See, Moses told him, he said, "Fear not." Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he knew that the God that was in the cloud was the same God that was with him. He knew that the God that that when when you read down further, he said that and I wanted to read it because it it stood out to me, but but when you read down, it it said that um Lord have mercy. said verse 22, that's what I want to get to. He said, "And the children of Israel," if you don't know the story, God, he opened the Red Sea and allowed them to part straight through on dry ground. And verse 22, and he said, "And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, and the waters were a wall unto unto them on their right hand and on their left. And the Egyptians pursued and went in after them in the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptian through the pillar of fire of the cloud. I thought it was striking that it said that the Lord looked down cuz you know I read this many many times and told the story but to realize that the Lord was right there with him that he he saw the Egyptians and he looked through the pillar of fire right at those Egyptians. Then he said that enemy right there is destroyed today. And it was striking to me. It said the Lord. So anytimes he said when I am afraid I will trust in thee. See, when you got a faith that that you realize that God is right here with me, God is standing right here with me. No matter how bad the situation looks, no matter how insurmountable it looks, God is right here watching directly over me. And that's why I wanted to read it so that you can see it that God, he was right there. He wasn't far off. He wasn't here or there. He wasn't all the way. He was right there. And not only that, he was watching. He was looking down on them. He saw the enemy and said this day this enemy is here no more. See that faith that was that now they had something. If you realize that you got something to believe in that when your trial and your test come will God be right there looking down. He said I'm the same yesterday, today and forever. So if he was there with the children of Israel and you are the children of God, therefore he's not he's here right with you. And matter of fact, he's closer with you now than he was with them. &gt;&gt; See, with them, he was in the pillar of cloud. He was in the fire. But but when he got down and he got further in the scripture and he died for you and he saved you and he he allowed you to come and get baptized, then he said, "I shall fill you with the Holy Ghost." See, that was a promise he would give to you. All you had to do is believe that God would do it for you. See, it all has to do what you having faith that God can do it. It all has to do is deep down the faith. And if you can believe that all things are possible, then you can believe that God can fill me with the Holy Ghost. God can change my nature, God can give me a new body, he can do these things. He can heal my body. And see, once you realize that it's all based upon your faith, the pro the angel told the prophet of God, if you can get them to believe, then all things will be possible. &gt;&gt; No matter how impossible it might have seemed, no matter how distant it might have seemed, all things would be possible. &gt;&gt; It's all about us elevating our faith to believe that these things can be possible. &gt;&gt; We don't even have to see it to believe it. See that's God Jesus said he said blessed is the man that believeth without sin. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's what faith is and and the prophet God talked about it. He said that he said now you see what faith is. It's something. Now look friends I know that all of you are at least know this. The body is controlled by five senses. Is that right? He said all right it's got five senses is everywhere that everything that controls this human body. He said the senses are the five senses is see is taste is feel is smell and hear is that right? Them five senses control the entire human body. He said now there is none of them that declare faith. He said faith is the six sense. He said, he said, "Faith is the only direct and positive sense. It's the sixth sense. Faith is more than sight. Faith is more than feeling. You don't have to feel faith. You don't taste faith. You don't smell faith. You don't see faith. Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen." And I thought about it. I said, "You know, each one of us have to have faith every single day." Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if if we got in our car and we turned our wheel to the right and it went left and then we turned it to the left and it went right, we the first thing we do is say something is wrong with this car because somebody told me that when it goes right, I'm supposed to go right. And when I turn it left, I'm supposed to go left. And I'm and and I and I was thinking about it. I was like, you know, we're believing in what somebody told us. It's that simple. Somebody told us that right was right and left. Who who's saying that that was the right way? But hey, all that I got to say is that sometimes we have faith in these things because there's something that's deeper that we believe is true. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I always think of it as as someone that studied mathematics. I said, you know, who decided that one was one and two was two? Only God could do that. Because if you look back through the time and look back through history, if we didn't have something to count, none of mathematics would work. Money wouldn't work. None of that would work. But it has to you have to every day that you get up, you have to have some type of faith. &gt;&gt; You have to believe that you know when I take this step, I can step. But you don't think about it because it's an inherent faith. It's something that it's been drilled in time over time that when I open my mouth, I can speak &gt;&gt; that I'm going to be able to create words and and and it's not until you less able to do it that you have to believe in something else. &gt;&gt; It's not until your leg hurts that you say, you know, that it was a blessing to be able to walk. &gt;&gt; It was a blessing to be able to lift my hands. It was a blessing to be able to do these things. And when the when it's been restored to you, then you realize, you know what, there there's a faith that I'm believing in that God does these things each and every day that the if the sun wasn't to rise one morning, the whole world would be in chaos. &gt;&gt; If if the if the moon wasn't to come up and do the tides every night, the world would be in chaos. For some reason, we believe that the sun's going to rise the next morning and we believe that the moon is going to come up because that's the way God created it. &gt;&gt; And when you realize how powerful the thing is that you have faith in of the things that you don't even think about, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's so it's so I wonder how easy it is to believe in God. &gt;&gt; If you can believe in all these things that your car going to run, your house still going to be there when you get back home, all these things. how simple it is to believe in the one that created you. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Can your faith be shaken? Can you be shaken?" Because when you have faith in God, the devil is going to come and test your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil is going to try to get you to not believe in what you can believe. That's why he sent the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; That's why he sent them there because he wanted them to forget the God that had just delivered them. He wanted them to forget the God that had just rocked them out of 400 years of slavery, &gt;&gt; had just delivered them and go to Mo Moses. And he wanted to cause contention in the camp. &gt;&gt; He wanted to cause a fight that they would go against the leader that was leading them, telling them to have faith in God, keep believing. He brought us out of Egypt. They got sick of that testimony. They had lost faith in the one that was leading them. God had put in position to lead them. &gt;&gt; They had gone on to now they said you could have left us back in sin. &gt;&gt; You could have left us back in there. We could have just lived our lives and died a slave when there was something that was promised that was greater to come to them. &gt;&gt; There was something that God had for them that was greater than where they were. And God was God had to deliver them from the Egyp Egyptians to take them to the promised land. They couldn't be in the promised land in Egypt. They couldn't They had to go through the wilderness. They had to cross the Red Sea. They had to go in the in the desert before they crossed to over there into into the promised land. But they had to one day believe that there was a promised land for me. &gt;&gt; And said, "Sometimes you got to believe that there's a heaven and there's a place that's set aside for me. &gt;&gt; And I can't tell you whether you believe it or not, but I believe there's a house that God has prepared for me." cuz he said in his word that he promised that there were mansions that was there that you know that's untold or unseen things that we've never seen before that's over there that's waiting and prepared for those that believe in him. But if you don't believe that he's the one true God and he can save you from your sins. How are you ever going to get there? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; See, it all comes back to whether you can believe or not. And when you when you do believe, can you be shaken? when you do believe, can you be shaken? And and I thought of some some people in the Bible when I was reading here and I thought of and I was like, you know, Lazarus and his sisters, his sisters, they believed in God, but they was a little iffy. You know, somebody you talk to them and you know, they be iffy. What I mean is they they'll say something and then two seconds later they'll change their mind and two more seconds later they'll change their mind again. You be like, "I wonder. I can't really trust what you what you standing on." &gt;&gt; Because whatever you standing on, you're not sure what you're standing on. &gt;&gt; And if you're not sure, then and then I don't want to be confused because you're not sure. And so, son, they was a little iffy. They said, "Lord, we know that you can raise him up again in the resurrection. We know we know certain things are true. We have faith that you're the one true God and all these things, but you'll raise them up in the resurrection." But God was trying to show them. Jesus was trying to show them that I want you to elevate your faith higher. You don't have to wait till the resurrection to see your brother. You don't have to wait till the resurrection even though he might have been in the grave for 4 days. This is the God that does the impossible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if he wants to, he can go to the gravestone just like he did and say, "Lazarus, come forth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That took faith. That took believing. But he knew that the word that was spoken, something had to happen because when he spoke a word, when God speaks a word, which he put in his in his Bible, when God speaks a word, it can't return unto him void. So when he speaks it, all you have to do is believe it. &gt;&gt; There was faith behind the words that was spoken. &gt;&gt; Now, they said that if he wouldn't have called Lazarus, everybody in the grave would have woke up. Why? Cuz that was the faith that was behind that word. That's why he had to call him by name. He had to say, "Lazarus, come forth." And see, when God calls you, he calls you by your name. He doesn't go to this one or that one or this one and that. He said, "You come forth." He calls you by name. He said, "You come unto me." &gt;&gt; All ye that heavily laid and heavy burden and I'll give you rest. He calls you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because he knows specifically who he's calling. &gt;&gt; He's not going to sister and brother them. He said it's you. And when he calls you, he wants you to have faith and believe that I'm calling you. Come unto me. &gt;&gt; See, that's why, but the sisters, she, you know, they might have had faith until they actually seen Lazarus walking. And then some of them was like, is that true? And then Jesus had to tell them, "Go loose some. Let him go. &gt;&gt; He's free. He's He's here now. He's back. I brought him here." So So because I wanted you to see that all things are possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to see before I die that someone can be dead and be re and God can call them back. Before I go in this grave and get crucified, I want you to see that it's real. He's the same God. He He let him show. He showed it to him before. I don't know why they had a problem believing that he was going to come back cuz he showed them Lazarus. &gt;&gt; If he showed it, he he said, "I'm the same yesterday, today, and forever." So he showed him Lazarus. He said, "This man could be stinking in the grave 4 days and speaking the word of faith that he can come back." &gt;&gt; Now, if he can do that, when I get crucified, what do you think's going to happen when I said, "I'm coming back in 3 days." &gt;&gt; And see, they started, they might have questioned it, but it took them a lot of, you know, some of them had a had some experiences before they actually truly believed. Like the two men that was on the road to Emmas, they had to have a whole conversation. Now imagine you walking for hours and Jesus right there with you. He done told you I was I done died. I'm coming back. And it was a testimony that morning that the women they went to the tomb and they said nobody is here. So I can imagine them on the road and they getting dejected. You know he done died. We don't know what happened to his body and they getting dejected on this road. But and then but when they get on the road, they start talking to this stranger. These two men start talking to this stranger and you know they having a conversation but the conversation get real interesting because you ever had a conversation with someone and and the whole conversation you sitting there learning &gt;&gt; you sitting there learning and it become a good conversation. It's like wow I ain't never see it like that. And he going through from Genesis all the way up into time showing where Jesus was said he would be in the Bible and what was going to happen to him when he come and talking about David and talking about Elijah when he prophesied of these things and going through all the scriptures. See they was educated and learned. They knew what he was talking about and they knew what he was saying was the truth. And when they got down to it, they realized, you know what? We we want to continue on cuz Jesus, he fained like he was going to go on down the road. And they said, "No, no, no. You got to stop here." Sometimes you got to stop Jesus when he on his way. &gt;&gt; Jesus was on his way. And they had to stop him. They said, "No, no, no. Uh-uh. Whatever you giving us, Lord, I want more of it." And sometimes you got to have faith and you be like, "You know what? I may not understand it, but Lord, I want more of it. Lord, I may not understand what's going on, but Lord, I want more of it. Lord, while you're filling with your anointing, I may not understand all that comes with it, but I want more of it. See, when you filling my cup, I want it to overflow. I don't just want to be filled. Said when when they kept when they entreated him to come, it was something about they said, you know, we've been traveling all day. Let's let's get some food. And they went to he and when he went and he broke the bread, their eyes were open. They understood right then that this was Jesus, the one that said that that told us that what was going to happen and now he's here with us. Now their faith had exploded. They they ran all the way back to those that were gathered and said, "We saw him. We saw the man that told us that he was going to die and raise again. We saw Jesus &gt;&gt; now. It wasn't just something that was told to him. It wasn't something that, you know, they thought of, they envisioned. It was an experience. It was something that they know they could tell it with great faith, with great enthusiasm. You know what? We're no longer shaken. We're no longer worried about whether he's here or whether he's not. We know he's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We saw him with our own eyes. We know he's with us. We know that he he came back. We know that he died and he rose again. We're not worried about what you told him. We know it from ourselves. Now &gt;&gt; see see they they had gotten up to the level and they were speaking with the impassion that they knew. And then Jesus he eventually he showed up in the room with them. &gt;&gt; For all those that didn't believe including doubting Thomas &gt;&gt; he showed up. He some people you can't just tell them a thing. You got to show them. &gt;&gt; And some people you can't even show them. They got to see it for themselves. &gt;&gt; And some people you can't even show them or let them see it for the do action. that actually believe, you know, it's possible. &gt;&gt; You know, if you told someone, "I can hammer a nail through this wood." Some people be like, "No, you can't." Some people got to put the hammer in their hand and do it like that. And some people they got to do it for themselves to you know what the hammer the nail does go through the wood. But it it's all in different levels of faith though. It's whether you believe when somebody tell you or whether you have to do the action. And sometime God has to allow your faith to grow. That's right. &gt;&gt; God has to allow your faith to grow and he has to allow you to come up. He said he said some have faith that can heal. He said some people they have great big faith. He said they can be healed in a moment. Some have faith that much that that they can be healed in a week. Some has muster seed faith. He said it takes them a long time. But just follow it. It's genuine. It'll bring you to the light. Just hold on to it and keep moving. and it'll bring you out. You just keep holding on to that faith, it'll bring you through. It's real mustard seed. You know, mustard don't mix with nothing. It's genuine. You can't mix kale and spinach and so forth. You can't mix mustard with nothing. And when they mustard stays mustard and when real faith takes a hold in the heart, it's not intellectual. It's it's not reason no more. It's real. It's the spirit of God witnessing through you. God's word is true. I stay right with it. Yes, sir. And that brings the results. See, when you have real faith in God, nothing can move you from your faith. &gt;&gt; Nothing can persuade you, dissuade you that your faith is real. &gt;&gt; And what God has spoken to you, whether he whether you understand it or not, you say, "I'm standing on it. See, I believe it. God spoke it. God said it. And that's it for me. That's all that matters to me. I can stand right here on this faith and believe that God is going to do what he said he's going to do. I can believe that God is going to heal my body because he says by his stripes I am healed. I don't have to move. I don't have to be persuaded. No matter what the doctor says, nobody says or even how I feel. &gt;&gt; See, the devil deals a lot with your feelings, but faith supersedes your feelings. You got to get past how you feel. You got to get past how you're thinking. You got to change your mindset and said, "Lord, what you said, I believe it. That settles it. And I got to keep going on it. I might not see it today. I might not see it tomorrow. I might not see it next week. But I know that eventually something is going to take place because I believe in what you said. I believe that you're going to do it. And I'm going to stand on it. I'm going to keep confessing it until like like the the the man in the story, his eyes popped open. He kept telling everyone, "I can see. I can see. I can see. I can see." And one day he was sitting in that barber chair and his eyes popped open. He said, "I can see." It was a reality. His testimony became his reality. And whatever you say is power in what you speak. THERE'S POWER IN what you speak. And when you elevate your faith to believe in what you're saying, something got to take place. Something has to move in your life. Something has to go on because you believe in what you say and you're not wavering on it. You're not moving ON IT. YOU'RE NOT GOING ON. You said, "Lord, I'm standing right here just like Jacob. I'm wrestling this angel. I'm going to continue to wrestle this angel till God does something for me." &gt;&gt; See, I'm going to believe that God got a blessing for me. And I'm not letting this angel go until he blessed me. I'm He came for a reason. and I'm going to get what God has for me right now today cuz I believe that God can do it for me. &gt;&gt; Says some people it'll take a week, it'll take a month, it might take a year. But if you stand on it and you believe and you keep having faith and you don't doubt every time the devil brings that down into your mind, you you send it away and say, "Get behind me, Satan. No, get behind me, Satan. No, that ain't what the Lord told me. Uh-uh. I'm going to let it go. I'm going to let it go." Uh-uh. MOVE ON. I'm standing right here because God told me if I trust in him and never doubt, he would surely bring me out. See, that's what I'm believing in. That's what I'm trusting in. That's what I'm standing on. Lord, elevate my faith. Lord, move me higher. Lord, [screaming] take me higher. Lord, elevate my faith, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You have to pray those prayers cuz sometimes you're not where God wants you to be. You can't until you get there. You said, "Lord, elevate me. Lord, move me higher. Lord, take me deeper. Lord, give me a deeper walk. Lord, give me a closer walk, Lord. Lord, elevate my faith. I want to see you more, Lord. I want to see you every day, Lord. I don't want to be on Sundays only, but Lord, move in my life. &gt;&gt; See, Lord, I believe. I trust you. Lord, I trust you and I won't doubt you. &gt;&gt; See, when you get there, you'll realize what Abraham was talking about when it said he staggered not at the promises of God. See, see when you get that type of faith, you realize he can get up and he can move without his family. He can get up and leave there. He can believe in a promise for 25 years. &gt;&gt; It didn't take Abraham a week a month. It took him 25 years to get what God promised him. But it said he staggered not at the promises of God. He staggered not when God told him, "You going to have a son." Not only that, you going to have a son with your wife. the one that's right here with you, that's just that's getting up in age just with you. Y'all both are going to have a son. See, it took him 25 years to realize it. But when the realization came, it was just like God said it would be. It God didn't need no help in it. God didn't need no nothing of anything they could do. It was just what God wanted to do in Abraham's life. It was just what God promised unto him. But you had Abraham had to have faith to believe that this was possible. Yes. &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't understand it. He might not have understand it. And many of times, guess what? When you on your journey, some people are not going to understand what God told you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you tell them, sometimes you got to keep your mouth closed cuz other people ain't going to understand what God told you. &gt;&gt; Those might be close to you. They they might not understand. And they might do like Joel friends and try to convince you. Why do you serve the God that you serve? Mhm. &gt;&gt; I see the God that you serve just take you through trials and tribulation. &gt;&gt; I see the God that you serve take your whole family from you. &gt;&gt; I see the God that you serve take all your money and all your riches. I see the God that you serve give you a sickness that you right here on the side of the road with boils on your skin and no one wants to be around you. That's that's the God that you serve. Yes. &gt;&gt; And to have such faith in God &gt;&gt; that said, "Naked I came into this world and naked I shall return." &gt;&gt; See, when Job had such faith in God, see, that's why God allowed the devil to attack him. &gt;&gt; He allowed him cuz he knew his faith in God was going to supersede all of that. &gt;&gt; His faith in God and trust in God was going to move past all of that. It was going to allow him to look past all of that and said, and allow him to believe that, you know what, the same God that gave it to me, it's okay if he take it away. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's okay if he take it away. And if that's the end of my story, then that's okay, too. &gt;&gt; Because when I go, I'm going to see him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to see him in my flesh. And that and see, he had that understanding that it was something that I can't be shaken in what I believe in. Well, I believe in a God that supersedes all the ones that y'all talking about. All the ones that have y'all swaying back and forth. No, no, no. This God that I I can keep him believing on them cuz the Lord gave me all these things. But you see, that wasn't the end of Job's story. That wasn't the end of Job's story. One day, he got to the other side of the test and the trial. After God rewarded him for his faith, God rewarded him for believing and trusting him and staying true to what he believed in. God allowed him to gain doublefold what he lost. &gt;&gt; God allowed him to get double what he lost. And it was something that they say Job was the first first book that was written in the Bible way way before many of the other ones. And the first story is a faith, the trials and tribulation of faith in God. It shows you how important it is when you have faith that all things are possible. Now, now he God could have ended the story with Job just holding on to the word and still in it. But God allowed you to see that there's something that's greater than where you are in your current situation. That could have been the end of the story, but God allowed it to come on through. Come on through. No, no, no. I want to show you that there's a blessing on the other side of the test. There was something on the other side of the test. If you keep on believing, if you keep on trusting, if you keep on believing, God will do the impossible. Now, Job might have been okay if he did a third of what he had before, but God blessed him with double what he had before. See, there's nothing that God can't do. All you got to do is sit down and say, "Lord, I believe." Lord, I believe. That's it. Lord, I believe. And I'm not going to move on it. Lord, I believe. And when the doubt comes, I push it aside and say, "Lord, I believe." And when the devil comes, I push him aside and say, "Lord, I believe." And when when this one comes, I'll push them aside and say, "Lord, I believe." And when that one comes and mother and father, they don't understand. But Lord, I believe that Lord, I I don't understand how, but I know if you sent me this way, you got a way to bring me through this way. Lord, if you to order my step this way, then you're going to continue to take my steps on. I don't understand it. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't understand. But I don't need to understand. All I got to do is trust you, Lord. All I got to do is believe that you're ordering my steps. All I got to do is understand that you're leading me, you're guiding me, you're taking me along this way. And Lord, if I'm put my trust in you, and I don't doubt you, I know that you're going to lead me out of it. I know that you're going to bring me over it because that's what you said you would do. &gt;&gt; Said, &gt;&gt; and and and I started to see it. I said Abraham, his faith never wavered through all the test and trials of life that he went through. And I wanted to I wanted to turn to the scripture because there was something in Romans chapter 4 verse 20. When you got to say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the reason he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was also to perform. He was able also to perform. See, what God promised, he is also able to perform. &gt;&gt; And therefore, it was imputed to him for righteousness. Now, it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him. See, God didn't put this in the Bible for Abraham's sake alone. &gt;&gt; He put it to for each one of us to see that God was able to do these things. And now it was not written for his sake alone that it was that it was imputed to him, but for us also to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised Jesus Christ, Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered from for our offenses and was raised again for his justification. And if you read down in chapter 5, it said, "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith and to his grace, wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God." See, with your faith, you have access to God. &gt;&gt; With your faith, you have access to God. When you believe in what God is, what God tells you, you have a pathway straight to him. said, "Lord, it's not what I'm standing on. It's that you said it and you said, "If I believe in it, then that's all that mattered. It it didn't matter whether I these are not my words, Lord. These are your words." And you said that whenever a word was sent out of your mouth, when you sent it out, it can't return back to you without doing nothing. So, if it can't return into your void, then something has to happen. See, I'm not trusting in my ability. I'm not trusting in my thoughts. I'm not trusting in what somebody told me. I'm trusting in what you put in your word. See, that's what I'm standing on. And when I stand on it, I know that I can't be shaken off of it. Cuz this is the only thing that's going to stand through the test of time. This is the only thing that's going to allow you when you get over there. It's the only thing that's going to be the that you can stand on and say, "Lord, I put my faith in your word. I didn't put my faith in this one or that one. I put my faith in your word, and that's what I'm standing on." The same one that same message that Paul preached. That's what I'm standing on. &gt;&gt; Said because when you put your word, your faith in him, you can't be shaken. You can't be moved. You can't be persuaded otherwise because you know what you put your faith in. &gt;&gt; And when someone comes and tries to push you to the side, you say, "No, no, no. Uh-uh. This is what I believe." &gt;&gt; I believe in what God said. I believe in what he spoke in his word. I believe in the thing that's been going on for over 6,000 years. And that's what I'm standing on. And there ain't no other book that we can read that's been going on over 6,000 years that has stood this long and and stood this test of times and and and has been tried over and over again and found out to be true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, whether you understand it or not, you got to look beyond what you can see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to look beyond what you can feel. You got to look beyond what you even understand. And you got to believe in something that you can't even see. But that's all God asks you to do. All I want you to do is believe. Believe in me. Believe that I am he. That I am the one that comes and that created all things. Believe it. And if you believe it, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do is believe it. Then all things are possible. All things are possible. All you got to do is believe. I said it's nothing that great. It's something that's so simple, but people make it so complicated. All you have to do is believe. All you have to do is say, "Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe and all things shall be possible." Said, "Can you be shaken?" The answer is no. If you got your faith in the right thing, &gt;&gt; if you have your faith in the right thing, then you can't be shaken. You can't be moved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Said the songwriter said, "I shall not be moved." He said, "I'm like a tree planted by the rivers of water." &gt;&gt; Said, "I shall not be moved." Let us all stand this morning. Let us bow. Lord Jesus, we come before you this morning, Lord. And Lord, if there's someone here that said, you know, I've been struggling with my faith. I've been struggling in what I believe. I've been struggling with going further in the Lord. I've been struggling with what I've been going through. and the devil has been trying to fight me and cause me to doubt. If that's you this morning, with all heads bowed and eyes closed, just lift up your hand. [music] Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Lord, you see all the hands that are lifted.
