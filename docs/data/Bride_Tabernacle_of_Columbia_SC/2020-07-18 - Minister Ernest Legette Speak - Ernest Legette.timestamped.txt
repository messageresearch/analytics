[20:40] matthew 8 will begin at the first verse
[20:47] matter of fact we'll begin at the fifth
[20:48] verse
[20:55] tonight i want to minister on a topic
[20:58] and i entitled it speak
[20:59] amen speak
[21:02] amen speak and it'll be as you say
[21:06] amen speak matthew eight
[21:10] and five and it reads
[21:14] and jesus was entered into capernaum
[21:17] and when jesus entered into capernaum
[21:20] there came unto him a censuring
[21:22] a centurion beseeching him and saying
[21:25] lord
[21:25] my servant lieth at home sick of the
[21:28] policy
[21:29] charm in it and jesus said unto him i
[21:32] will come and heal him
[21:34] and the centurion answered and said lord
[21:36] i am not worthy
[21:38] that thou should has come under my roof
[21:40] but speak
[21:42] the word only and my servant shall be
[21:44] healed
[21:45] for i'm a man of authority having
[21:48] soldiers
[21:48] under me and i say to this man go
[21:52] and he goeth and to another come and he
[21:55] cometh
[21:55] and to my servant do this and he doeth
[21:57] it
[21:58] when jesus heard it he marveled and said
[22:01] to them that
[22:02] followed verily i say unto you i have
[22:06] not found so great of faith no not in
[22:09] israel
[22:09] and i say unto you that many shall come
[22:12] from the east
[22:13] and the west and shall sit down with
[22:16] abraham and isaac and jacob
[22:18] and in the kingdom of heaven but the
[22:21] children of the kingdom shall be cast
[22:23] out into into
[22:28] utter darkness outer darkness there
[22:31] shall be weeping and nationality
[22:33] and jesus said unto the centurion go thy
[22:36] way
[22:37] and as thou has believed so be it
[22:40] done unto thee and his servant was
[22:43] healed
[22:44] in the self-same hour may god had a
[22:46] blessed reading of his word
[22:47] may be seated tonight by god's grace
[22:50] just for a moment i want to speak to you
[22:53] on
[22:54] on a topic of speak amen speak
[22:58] i like how here that we find in this
[23:00] setting of the scriptures that
[23:02] the centurion you know no doubt had
[23:04] heard of the fame of jesus
[23:06] and in jesus he recognized
[23:09] the the authority and the capabilities
[23:12] that
[23:13] that jesus had he recognized we say what
[23:16] jesus
[23:17] was capable of because he even said it
[23:20] in his speaking that he says that
[23:22] you know i'm a man of under authority so
[23:25] he could he spoke to jesus because what
[23:28] he saw in jesus
[23:29] was authority so he began to ask
[23:32] uh jesus he says you don't even have to
[23:35] come to my
[23:36] house but what i see in you
[23:39] i see the the capabilities i see the
[23:42] power in you
[23:43] that all you've got to do is speak it
[23:46] and it'll be just as you said
[23:48] and a lot of times i believe today that
[23:51] you know as we talk about how the church
[23:53] world and the world itself today
[23:56] has lost the respect for the ministry
[23:59] we find is that it's because sometimes
[24:02] they've lost that insight or the or of
[24:06] just
[24:07] how powerful the spoken word of god is
[24:10] they lost their
[24:11] insights sometimes of just of the
[24:14] ability
[24:15] that's in the one that gave the word
[24:18] come on
[24:18] and that's why he says in one's place he
[24:21] says that
[24:22] you know before any man coming to god he
[24:24] got the first believe that he is god
[24:27] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[24:30] diligently seek him
[24:31] before you even come to him you got to
[24:33] first have
[24:35] a faith uh to believe come on
[24:38] that he is god and that there's nothing
[24:41] that we say that that can stand before
[24:43] him but it's
[24:44] recognizing the capabilities of the one
[24:47] that gave the word and that's what we're
[24:49] looking at here i said you know i was
[24:51] thinking
[24:52] of myself i says we're living in such a
[24:55] we call them
[24:56] unstable times and we do things now a
[24:59] lot of times in
[25:00] such which seem to be an unorthodox way
[25:03] you know we used to sometimes in service
[25:06] and
[25:07] how the people could come to the altar
[25:09] and you lay hands on them and
[25:11] and praying with them and help you know
[25:13] pray them through
[25:14] but i say it's in the hours our that we
[25:17] live in
[25:18] i believe that just now even though as
[25:21] we might not
[25:22] be doing things in the way that we we
[25:25] used to
[25:26] uh uh do i'm gonna achieve them but that
[25:28] don't stop
[25:30] god from being who he is that don't stop
[25:33] the ability
[25:34] of the power that's in god come on i
[25:37] believe that
[25:38] jesus was going out in that day laying
[25:40] hands on a sick
[25:41] and they were recovering but that
[25:43] centurion
[25:44] he took it to a whole nother level he
[25:47] took it to a whole nother
[25:49] we would call extreme he says come on if
[25:51] he got the power like that
[25:53] you don't even have to come to my house
[25:56] you don't have to lay
[25:57] hands on my servant or do anything like
[25:59] that all i need to do is to hear you
[26:02] speak the word and i know it'll be as
[26:04] you say
[26:05] come on and i said that's what the faith
[26:07] of the people
[26:08] even an hour that we live in has arrived
[26:12] to that occasion
[26:13] it has to rise you know the bible says
[26:16] that when the enemy comes in like a
[26:18] flood
[26:18] that the spirit of the lord will lift up
[26:20] a standard come on
[26:22] to to to do to go against the enemy come
[26:25] on when the devil
[26:26] come in and raging and roaring you know
[26:28] like a mighty lion guard
[26:30] sends an anointing to meet him on that
[26:32] plane hallelujah where he is
[26:34] and that anointing that when god sends
[26:37] and meet him on that plane come on
[26:39] it'll defeat him or no matter what
[26:41] ground he's on
[26:42] i like how in the scriptures how it was
[26:45] one place where the enemy was saying
[26:47] i forget it whether it was in the
[26:48] mountain or the valley he said let's go
[26:50] there because we'll be able to defeat
[26:52] him there
[26:53] and god told told his children of israel
[26:55] i want you to go in that place
[26:57] because i'ma show them i'm god of the
[26:59] mountain just as i'm god in the valleys
[27:01] come on
[27:02] no matter where the battleground is god
[27:04] is still the victorious
[27:06] he's still all powerful he's still
[27:09] overcomer why
[27:10] because he is god amen and the spirit of
[27:13] the lord like we said or lift up a
[27:15] standard come on
[27:16] hallelujah as the demon powers rage
[27:19] don't you know the anointing
[27:21] is lifting up a standard god's spirit is
[27:24] raising us up
[27:25] to a place to what he's saying you can't
[27:27] no longer stay down there but you got to
[27:29] let me lift you
[27:30] up hallelujah let the word or
[27:33] do something in your life and i says
[27:35] that's what it is it's no longer
[27:37] just hearing good sermons but the word
[27:39] of god you've got to
[27:41] open up and let it go past your
[27:43] intellectual knowledge of your head and
[27:46] your reasoning and all your thinking but
[27:48] it's got to let
[27:49] it get down to the depths of the soul
[27:51] where the holy ghost can take it
[27:53] and make the world live again bringing
[27:56] you to a place that nobody else can't
[27:58] see
[27:58] i like that how jesus told his disciples
[28:02] he says the world won't be able to see
[28:04] me he said but you'll be able to see me
[28:06] he said why because i'll be no longer
[28:09] with you
[28:09] but i'll be in you how in the form of
[28:12] the holy ghost
[28:14] when the world in the church world ain't
[28:16] seeing the power of god no more
[28:18] when only thing they looking at is
[28:20] stories and good sermons
[28:21] the people of god those that's been born
[28:24] again
[28:25] those that open up their heart and the
[28:27] word of god has come in
[28:28] he's brought them to a place to where
[28:30] they still seen guard
[28:32] to where they still didn't lose their
[28:35] faith in god
[28:36] but they still got faith hallelujah the
[28:39] move mountains
[28:41] and i believe that but i'm talking about
[28:43] tonight speak
[28:44] i like that how the centurion begin to
[28:47] tell jesus
[28:48] he says speak come on and it'll be just
[28:51] as you say
[28:53] recognizing that that authority
[28:56] that uh uh uh the ability that was in
[28:59] christ
[29:00] and i want to say that you know jesus
[29:02] christ is the same
[29:04] yesterday today and forever god didn't
[29:07] quit speaking god is still speaking
[29:09] but it takes your faith grab and hold to
[29:12] the word
[29:13] and believing it on him just as the
[29:16] scriptures say
[29:17] and watch the rivers of water of living
[29:20] waters
[29:21] flow from out of your belly how would it
[29:23] flow from out of your belly because
[29:25] it'll be coming
[29:26] out of your mouth which you speak
[29:28] there'll be life
[29:29] you speaking life wherever you go the
[29:31] dead situation
[29:33] you speak into those situations to those
[29:35] that are going through
[29:36] you speaking life into those situations
[29:39] and bringing the
[29:40] people into a hope hallelujah
[29:44] and i believe that god is so good to us
[29:46] you know
[29:48] i said speak tonight we look at how
[29:51] you know we know that everything i was
[29:54] just meditating in prayer the other day
[29:56] i said you know we got to realize just
[29:59] how
[30:00] powerful the spoken word of god is come
[30:02] on you know everything that we see
[30:05] i i began to meditate in prayer the
[30:07] trees the dust and
[30:09] and the cars and everything that we see
[30:12] and have
[30:12] access you know to in the world today
[30:16] was are all a result a result
[30:20] of the spoken word of god god said let
[30:23] there be
[30:24] come on he didn't even have the he
[30:26] didn't have to get the materials and all
[30:28] of that
[30:28] but when the spoken word went out it
[30:31] created
[30:32] hallelujah it created those things that
[30:35] we see today
[30:36] in the spoken word is the ability to
[30:39] create
[30:40] and that's what it is you know we says
[30:42] that
[30:43] uh uh we do believe that in the book of
[30:45] hebrews 11 it says that the things
[30:48] that we cannot see come on there are the
[30:50] real things
[30:51] because the things that we see they were
[30:53] made by the things
[30:54] which we cannot see come on and that's
[30:57] what it is
[30:58] the spoken word of god when he spoke the
[31:00] word
[31:01] it created hallelujah and that's the
[31:04] same thing today
[31:05] i said if he put the words in your mouth
[31:08] when you speak
[31:09] you don't have to that's what the devil
[31:11] does he makes us
[31:12] uh always think that we got to see the
[31:15] situation out
[31:16] we got to see the door open we got to
[31:18] see our way out come on
[31:20] but it ain't in sin it ain't touching
[31:23] him
[31:23] feeling in his five senses but it's in
[31:26] only speaking
[31:27] and believing the word come on i believe
[31:30] god
[31:30] spoke the word and he believed what he
[31:33] said when he said
[31:34] let there be it had no other choice but
[31:37] to come forth why
[31:38] because he spoke the word and it created
[31:41] hallelujah
[31:42] and you and i today can see we got that
[31:45] same
[31:46] you know he said he said the works that
[31:48] i do
[31:49] shall you do also come on i'm talking
[31:51] about getting
[31:52] to a place to where you're not just a a
[31:55] former church goer
[31:56] you're not just one that sit in the pews
[31:59] and clap your
[32:00] hands and sing a song and just praise
[32:02] the lord and shout and dance
[32:04] but you got a hold of something you got
[32:06] a hold of life
[32:07] and something down in the depths of your
[32:09] soul beginning speaking hallelujah
[32:12] and create that's what it is i said we
[32:15] in the time now
[32:16] where we got to create our own uh a way
[32:19] out of this situation come on how are
[32:21] you going to do it
[32:21] because you're going to speak it and
[32:23] you're going to start believing what you
[32:25] speak
[32:26] you're going to start speaking like
[32:28] you're more than an overcomer like you
[32:30] more than the conquering in the devil
[32:31] ain't got no other choice
[32:33] but to move how many believe that
[32:35] hallelujah
[32:37] i said speak come on everything we see
[32:40] today
[32:42] is a product we say of the spoken word
[32:45] of god
[32:46] god spoke it out we look it says by the
[32:49] word of god
[32:50] the bible says that the worlds they were
[32:53] formed come on
[32:54] that's how it was by the word of god the
[32:56] saints of old the bible said believe
[32:58] that
[32:59] they believed that god spoke the word
[33:01] and it came to pass
[33:03] and if the saints of old can believe it
[33:05] it could move
[33:06] mountains with what they believe how
[33:08] about you and i believing in that same
[33:10] spoken word of god today
[33:12] i believe that it'll still it'll still
[33:15] uh move
[33:16] mountains i look at how i said that just
[33:19] as god spoke the word and the power
[33:23] that was in that word that he spoke i
[33:26] said i began to look at certain things
[33:28] in the scriptures
[33:29] i said god just as you spoke and it
[33:32] obeyed you
[33:32] i said lord you spoke some things
[33:35] concerning us
[33:36] in the hour that we live in and just as
[33:39] it had to come to pass then god what you
[33:42] spoke it's got to come to pass now
[33:44] sometimes we worried and we be weary
[33:47] because we seeing the times
[33:49] in the battle that we faced with but i
[33:51] don't believe
[33:52] that david was worried about goliath
[33:54] standing up there
[33:55] in front of him but he remembered that
[33:58] that abraham seed was going to be
[34:00] blessed
[34:00] no matter what and he was going to
[34:02] possess all the gates of his enemies and
[34:05] no man
[34:06] wouldn't be able to stand before him
[34:07] long as god was on his side
[34:09] he began to say you come with me to a
[34:12] sword in a spirit
[34:13] i don't even have those things but what
[34:15] i do know i'm coming to you in the name
[34:18] of the lord
[34:18] and that word that he given us is more
[34:21] powerful to take down a giant
[34:23] i don't care what giant is in your life
[34:25] but what you're faced with today
[34:27] let god be the control of that situation
[34:30] move out the way
[34:31] and let god speak on your behalf let god
[34:34] create
[34:35] signs and wonders in your life and god
[34:37] will do it how many believe that come on
[34:40] we're talking about speak i said you
[34:43] know
[34:43] just as we look at that says god even
[34:46] today
[34:47] that same god he spoke some some words
[34:51] about you and i come on and it got to
[34:53] come to pass
[34:54] just as it come to pass then it's got to
[34:56] come to pass now
[34:57] i like how you know in the scriptures
[35:00] how
[35:01] he says that they are overcome by the
[35:04] blood of the lamb
[35:05] hallelujah he said they have overcome
[35:08] come on not that you will they have
[35:10] overcome they've overcome how did they
[35:13] overcome
[35:14] by the blood of the lamb hallelujah you
[35:16] know the battle is already won
[35:18] the battle is already finished once you
[35:21] give your life to christ
[35:23] and open up your heart and let jesus
[35:25] come in come on the devil
[35:27] is already defeated yes we got to go
[35:30] through growing stages and
[35:32] pains and all these things to try us but
[35:34] what it is god
[35:36] bringing us to perfection god ain't
[35:38] gonna let you fall to the ground
[35:40] but before he let that happen i believe
[35:43] he'll bankrupt heaven
[35:44] but god allows certain things to happen
[35:47] in our lives
[35:48] just to get us to the next level bring
[35:50] us to the next phase in him
[35:52] hallelujah god bringing us through
[35:55] stepping stones and stumbling blocks
[35:57] come on god say
[35:58] turn those stumbling blocks into your
[36:00] stepping stones god
[36:01] building the stairway on up to that
[36:04] place in in christ jesus where you got
[36:06] to be
[36:07] and i believe that come on he said they
[36:10] have overcome
[36:11] you know about the blood of the lamb and
[36:14] the word of their testimony come on
[36:16] i believe that he said like the blood of
[36:19] the lamb and the word of their testimony
[36:21] somewhere along the line they had to
[36:23] start speaking
[36:25] their testimony not my testimony but
[36:28] your testimony
[36:29] not your testimony but my testimony come
[36:32] on what has god done for you lately
[36:35] i can talk to you about what god has
[36:37] done for me but you need your personal
[36:40] experience you got to know god for
[36:42] yourself because that's going to be your
[36:44] overcoming power
[36:46] that's going to be what create a
[36:48] deliverance in your life
[36:50] you got to start testifying you got to
[36:52] start believing
[36:53] that god will do just what he said he'll
[36:55] do
[36:56] you know i was sharing with my uncle
[36:57] once and when he was when he was
[37:00] uh dying and i began to tell him he was
[37:03] having a
[37:04] uh uh uh issues and the trouble
[37:08] with being healed in divine healing and
[37:10] i began to tell them i says you know
[37:12] my uncle herman i began to say to him i
[37:14] said you know when you speaking
[37:16] i said you speak in your own world and
[37:19] to exist you speaking that atmosphere
[37:21] around you i said what it is i said let
[37:24] me let me
[37:25] share one thing which i'll say is when
[37:26] you gave your life to the lord
[37:28] or when i gave my life to the lord and
[37:30] began speaking i said just as
[37:32] i left the altar that day i was telling
[37:35] everybody
[37:36] hey i'm saved come on i'm saved now
[37:38] people can look at you and say you were
[37:40] out in the world
[37:41] last night but now you're saying i'm
[37:43] saved today
[37:44] i said what it is i kept speaking that i
[37:47] was saved until i became what
[37:50] i spoke come on now i could have left
[37:52] and just had
[37:53] doubt but i believed it i believe that
[37:56] he said
[37:56] come on if if i can repent and be
[37:59] baptized come on believe on him
[38:01] as the scriptures say come on then he
[38:04] would he would save me
[38:06] because he died for the sins of the
[38:08] whole world
[38:09] and i was counted in that number so i
[38:12] might have
[38:12] not been where i posted being yesterday
[38:15] but i'm saved today why because i'm
[38:18] speaking it it's the word of my
[38:20] testimony i'm saved and i said i kept
[38:23] speaking it
[38:24] until the manifestation of it i had no
[38:27] other choice
[38:28] but to walk into what i spoke
[38:31] and i said the same way same faith
[38:34] that we use for salvation it's not
[38:38] in the preacher that preached it it's
[38:40] not in someone that told you
[38:42] but it's in you believing the spoken
[38:44] word of god
[38:45] it said you believe in what god said
[38:47] come on and
[38:48] something happened something took place
[38:52] down on the inside to us to a place now
[38:55] that nobody can't take that away from
[38:57] you they might point at your faults
[39:00] the devil might bring all kind of clouds
[39:02] of witness against you
[39:04] but i'm so glad to know that even today
[39:07] i ain't standing for myself but the
[39:09] blood
[39:10] hallelujah and signed my name in the
[39:13] blood is there as a token
[39:16] that i can be saved and i said just as
[39:19] you spoke
[39:20] uh you speak that concerning salvation
[39:23] it's the same way with healing come on
[39:26] it's the same faith
[39:27] you got to speak no matter how bad your
[39:29] body feels
[39:30] you got to speak that i'm healed you got
[39:33] to speak
[39:34] that it's all in the name of jesus come
[39:36] on i feel
[39:37] all right come on somebody i feel like
[39:40] dancing i feel like
[39:41] shouting you might be feeling all kind
[39:43] of pains but speak your way out that
[39:45] pain
[39:46] speak your way up that situation speak
[39:49] your way out of those
[39:50] shackles and the things that got you
[39:52] bound begin
[39:53] speaking and watch god do something in
[39:55] your life why because it's the spoken
[39:57] word of god
[39:58] it's what god spoke and the devil has no
[40:01] other choice but to obey it hallelujah
[40:04] we back to that time again the way we
[40:06] can speak and god said it'll be
[40:08] as you say speak to the mountain
[40:12] speak to your situation speak to your
[40:14] storm
[40:15] i'm putting the words in your mouth
[40:17] hallelujah
[40:18] and watch the devil flee
[40:22] i believe that with all of my heart come
[40:24] on
[40:25] i say speak come on
[40:29] speak in the midst of i was thinking to
[40:33] uh in prayer in the midst of all this
[40:35] world confusion
[40:37] i was thinking i was in prayer and i
[40:39] said you know
[40:41] just meditating on that they overcome
[40:44] come on
[40:45] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[40:47] that testimony
[40:48] i say that the world should last another
[40:51] 10 years from now
[40:52] think about how chaotic it'll be you
[40:55] think about
[40:56] the transition that the world has made
[40:59] in the last 20 years can we stand
[41:02] another
[41:02] 20 more years 30 more years of the world
[41:07] being engulfed in sin going deeper and
[41:10] further away from god i thought about
[41:13] how the scripture says
[41:15] that as it was in the days of noah you
[41:18] know the bible says that the imagination
[41:21] of men's heart clone was on evil
[41:24] continually
[41:25] all they thought about was sinning all
[41:28] they thought about was doing things
[41:30] that was displeasing to god that's all
[41:32] they thought about come on
[41:33] that's what was in their heart but i
[41:35] believe
[41:36] that even right now jesus said they
[41:39] overcame
[41:40] come on they had still had somebody
[41:43] whose heart wasn't corrupted
[41:45] whose mind wasn't defiled
[41:48] by the ways of the world but in their
[41:50] heart they still want to please god
[41:53] they held on in the midst of all the
[41:55] darkness
[41:56] in the midst of all the crisis why
[41:58] because it wasn't them
[42:00] but it was christ in them giving them
[42:03] unction
[42:04] from the holy one it was god that kept
[42:06] them the whole time
[42:08] i said god thank you you know when i lay
[42:11] down at night
[42:12] i say lord thank you for keeping us one
[42:15] more day lord
[42:17] you know why because we're kept by the
[42:19] power of god
[42:20] we're kept by god's power and what he's
[42:24] done for us how many believe that
[42:26] amen speak
[42:31] i said speak tonight come on we're
[42:33] thinking about
[42:34] how it says in the mystery confusion
[42:39] it's going to be a group of people in
[42:41] the midst of the darkness
[42:43] it's going to be a group of people that
[42:45] they gonna get the revelation
[42:47] that they're gonna begin speaking
[42:50] speaking their way
[42:51] out of darkness speaking their way out
[42:53] of all the confusion
[42:55] and they still see the light they still
[42:58] find jesus in a world that's broken
[43:02] in the world that's in chaos and pain
[43:05] hallelujah i preached the other week on
[43:08] a sermon in the world in pain
[43:10] and how when jesus came or how much
[43:14] torment they were going through and how
[43:16] much chaotic the world
[43:17] was jesus said a company healed a broken
[43:21] heart
[43:22] i come to set the captive free he came
[43:25] to him
[43:26] hallelujah in a time when they were in
[43:29] pain
[43:30] in a time when they were hurting and he
[43:33] began to share with them
[43:35] i've come to do for you what the church
[43:38] world can't do
[43:40] i'll come to do for you what the
[43:42] synagogues and
[43:43] what the sacrifices can't do i came to
[43:46] bring you
[43:47] to another place to a place of the
[43:50] supernatural
[43:52] to a place the way angels will be
[43:55] appearing
[43:55] to a place the way healings the
[43:58] miraculous the dead
[43:59] will raise why because i come to do
[44:01] those things
[44:03] hallelujah he said the spirit of the
[44:06] lord
[44:06] is upon me because he half anointed me
[44:10] to preach the gospel i said lord let the
[44:14] spirit of the god fall on the minister
[44:16] today
[44:18] the anointing the people are hurting
[44:21] people are in pain they need your help
[44:24] god anoint them lord let them speak the
[44:28] words of life
[44:29] we had enough good sermons and good
[44:32] preachers good church hallelujah
[44:36] lord we need to quicken in power we need
[44:38] something that's going to change the
[44:40] lives of people
[44:41] we need something that's going to uproot
[44:43] satan
[44:44] out of people's lives and cause them to
[44:46] want to come forth
[44:48] and live for the living god that's what
[44:50] we need
[44:52] how many believe that i said speak
[44:56] come on i like that how
[44:59] like i said he says that you're overcome
[45:02] by the blood of the lamb
[45:03] come on in the word of their testimony
[45:06] let's look at matthew 21
[45:11] by god's grace matthew 21-21
[45:18] god is good amen
[45:21] i said speak tonight matthew 21 and
[45:26] and 21.
[45:29] let's begin at 18th verse
[45:33] and it reads now in the morning
[45:36] as he returned into the city he hungered
[45:40] and when he saw a fig tree in the way he
[45:42] came to it
[45:44] and found nothing there on but
[45:47] leaves only and said unto it
[45:50] let no fruit grow on thee henceforth
[45:54] for forever and presently and presently
[45:57] the fig tree withered away
[46:01] jesus and when the disciples saw it they
[46:05] marveled
[46:06] saying how soon is the fig tree withered
[46:09] away
[46:10] jesus answered and said unto them verily
[46:13] i
[46:14] say unto you if ye have faith
[46:17] and not doubt and doubt not
[46:20] he shall not only do this which is done
[46:24] in the fig tree
[46:26] but also if ye
[46:29] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[46:32] removed
[46:33] and be thou cast into the sea it shall
[46:36] be done
[46:37] and so whatsoever things and all these
[46:40] things whatsoever ye
[46:42] shall ask in prayer believing ye shall
[46:45] receive
[46:46] come on i said speak tonight we find
[46:50] that here
[46:51] i like how the the centurion told jesus
[46:54] in our early scripture reading
[46:56] he said lord speak and i believe you
[46:59] know it'll be
[46:59] as you say but here jesus come
[47:04] you know and the disciples were
[47:06] marveling
[47:07] because jesus being a hunger
[47:11] the bible says that he saw a fig tree
[47:14] and it didn't have no figs even though
[47:18] it wasn't even the time for the figs to
[47:21] be upon the tree god cursed the tree
[47:25] and no soon as he cursed it when they
[47:28] came back around to it
[47:30] it was already dead and dried up
[47:33] and they began marveling to jesus
[47:37] about this victory but jesus
[47:40] began to say unto them come on
[47:43] that you don't have to marvel
[47:47] but with the same power that i spoke to
[47:51] this tree
[47:53] you got the same power shall have that
[47:56] same power
[47:57] in you all you got to do is speak
[48:01] and don't doubt it come on he put that
[48:04] in there
[48:05] and don't doubt it somebody said i know
[48:08] the lord do it but
[48:09] come on no don't doubt it there's no
[48:12] buts about it
[48:14] you just speak and that's it
[48:17] that settles it go on in god come on
[48:21] but he says that it'll be as you say
[48:24] come on the spoken word i want you to
[48:28] speak the word out of your mouth come on
[48:30] he said if you say to this mount come on
[48:34] why did he use mountains most likely
[48:37] because god knew that the road was going
[48:40] to be hard
[48:41] the trials and tribulations was up ahead
[48:44] you're gonna have some mountains you're
[48:46] gonna have some
[48:47] stormy days some weather and some rain
[48:50] to come in your life
[48:51] but all you got to do is speak
[48:54] don't doubt it hallelujah how many want
[48:57] to speak tonight
[48:59] i said speak and don't doubt it but
[49:02] it'll be as you say god i'm speaking my
[49:06] way into deliverance
[49:07] i'm speaking my way in out of this
[49:10] situation
[49:10] i'm speaking the devil out of my home
[49:13] away from my life
[49:14] i'm speaking it why because god has
[49:17] given me that authority
[49:19] don't you know god has given you
[49:21] authority and power
[49:23] in his name he said whatever you do
[49:26] do it in the name of the lord lord in
[49:29] jesus name
[49:30] devil get behind me in jesus name
[49:33] hallelujah i'm speaking it why
[49:37] because god has given me the authority
[49:39] satan
[49:40] you got to turn them loose why because
[49:42] god has given us the authority
[49:44] he promised this word that if we lay
[49:46] hands on the sick
[49:48] they shall recover it ain't in me but
[49:50] it's in god
[49:51] he spoke the word i'm only repeating
[49:54] what he said
[49:55] hallelujah and i heard it down in the
[49:58] depths of my soul
[49:59] i heard it rave out and say speak my
[50:02] word

[50:53] scriptures

[50:57] hallelujah of what the spoken word can

[51:03] banks of the red sea

[51:43] out of your mouth
[51:44] scriptures begin to come alive why
[51:47] because you're seeing jesus christ the
[51:50] same
[51:50] yesterday the day and forever and no
[51:53] devil can't stop you now
[51:55] why because you got a hold of something
[51:58] and when it comes out it's like a
[51:59] roaring lion
[52:01] hallelujah he says speak
[52:04] i believe joshua when they were in the
[52:07] battle come on
[52:09] something gave him auction to speak he
[52:12] looked up at the sun
[52:14] and he said stand still stand there
[52:18] and move i want you to stand over here
[52:20] and it hearkened
[52:21] to his voice why because it was the
[52:23] spoken word that came out
[52:26] i believe it was the same power that god
[52:29] used when he created them
[52:32] they knew it was the master speaking
[52:34] it's no longer
[52:35] you but it's christ in you speaking it's
[52:38] the anointing it's the quickening power
[52:41] all flesh has gotten out of the way god
[52:44] has got you in a corner the way you
[52:46] know you can't do it by yourself
[52:49] and he says speak the word and it'll be
[52:52] as you say
[52:54] come on i say glimpses of that spoken
[52:58] word
[52:59] god is so good i want you to speak
[53:04] i said you know there's so many
[53:06] situations
[53:07] and like i said now the way we're doing
[53:09] things today
[53:10] might be a little orthodox come on
[53:14] but what is god doing lifting up a
[53:16] standard
[53:17] what is god doing raising you higher
[53:21] to a place to where you're no longer
[53:24] depending on man to lay hands on you
[53:26] man to do this and man come on but he
[53:28] said i want you to start speaking
[53:30] you crying speak i'm still god you know
[53:35] my voice come on i believe that it says
[53:38] the name of the lord is strong tower
[53:40] is a strong tower let the righteous run
[53:43] to and they'll save
[53:45] god is still here doing the same things
[53:48] that he always done let the word i
[53:51] believe that
