[41:08] amen this many members don't think of
[41:12] himself higher than the author thing so
[41:14] many member body amen
[41:17] he says so we being many
[41:20] are one body in christ
[41:23] and every
[41:25] one members
[41:27] one of another
[41:28] six
[41:39] our ministry
[41:42] let us wait
[41:44] on our ministry
[41:46] are he that teaches on teaching eight
[42:03] let love be without dissimilation
[42:07] a that which is evil cleave to
[42:10] that which is good ten
[42:20] not slow for in business firming in
[42:23] spirit
[42:24] serving the lord 12.
[42:32] distributing to the necessity of the
[42:34] saints given to hospitality 14.
[42:42] rejoice with them that do rejoice
[42:45] and weep with them that weep 16.
[43:00] recompense to no man evil for evil
[43:03] provide things honest
[43:06] in the sight of all men 18.
[43:16] dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but
[43:20] rather give place
[43:22] unto wrath
[43:23] for it is written vineyards is mine
[43:27] i will repay said the lord to get
[43:30] 20.
[43:41] together
[43:43] be not overcome with evil but overcome
[43:46] evil with good
[43:48] god bless the religious world you may be
[43:49] seen
[43:52] i thought i would just read part of it
[43:54] but
[43:56] as i began to
[43:58] to read this particular chapter i said
[44:02] i believe that sometimes we have to be
[44:04] reminded how we ought to conduct our
[44:06] lives
[44:08] so i thought this whole chapter was
[44:10] needful that
[44:12] we are reminded of what god is requiring
[44:16] and what he's expecting of us
[44:18] because
[44:19] that latter part
[44:21] it really
[44:22] shows us
[44:24] that
[44:26] he said in the 14th verse says blessed
[44:29] bless them that what
[44:33] it's difficult to do that isn't that
[44:34] right
[44:36] to bless them how do i
[44:39] how do i bless them that persecute me
[44:43] you know it's not many people can
[44:45] perform that
[44:46] uh it takes a god pay love it takes
[44:49] god's love to bless them that persecute
[44:52] you
[44:54] it's usually he said
[44:57] you know don't do evil for evil but
[44:59] overcome evil with
[45:02] good
[45:03] there's so many things in there it says
[45:05] remember he says vengeance is mine i
[45:08] will what
[45:09] i will repay
[45:11] okay so by the grace of god there's so
[45:13] many things that we need to
[45:16] uh
[45:16] you know reacquaint ourselves with this
[45:19] particular chapter
[45:21] and just let us meditate a little bit in
[45:24] it
[45:25] and and let it sink down within our
[45:27] spirit that
[45:29] we allow the holy spirit with inside of
[45:31] us to conduct itself the way god wants
[45:34] to
[45:35] conduct himself and through us
[45:38] amen what i mean is how god wants to
[45:42] live inside of us and express his
[45:45] attributes to us
[45:47] but we must
[45:48] we must yield ourselves to his will and
[45:51] his word amen until we are able to yield
[45:55] ourselves in such a way that god can
[45:57] express his love and express
[46:01] himself through us amen
[46:04] that so much and so the people would say
[46:07] that when they see you they see jesus
[46:09] christ
[46:10] amen they see the love of god they see
[46:13] god expressed through you
[46:15] because your behavior your conduct is a
[46:19] reflection of the love of god
[46:22] amen and that's what we want out of each
[46:24] and every one of our lives we want to
[46:27] amen
[46:28] let people see jesus not us
[46:31] amen
[46:32] so he said let us not think of ourselves
[46:35] more
[46:36] highly than we
[46:39] but to think solely amen
[46:41] see sometimes
[46:45] you know i i was in prayer and i was
[46:48] writing down some things i think i got
[46:50] up to write some things and
[46:52] you know
[46:54] sometimes we believe that
[46:57] god owed us
[47:00] that he's indebted to us
[47:03] that god really owed us
[47:06] and not only the things that we do for
[47:08] god we think that god
[47:10] owe us
[47:11] sometimes the things that we do for god
[47:14] we thank the
[47:15] that the church owed us
[47:18] that the the
[47:20] the ministry owed us
[47:22] so the things that we do for god from
[47:25] our heart sometimes we feel indebted
[47:29] by the way we respond by the way we talk
[47:33] we feel like i've done this and i've
[47:36] done that you know we're talking about
[47:39] let me read that verse that we're
[47:40] talking about this morning the perfect
[47:43] will and trying to do god
[47:46] the service without it being its will
[47:48] and we're talking about the perfect will
[47:50] of god because many times we can walk
[47:53] in
[47:54] the permissive will of god
[47:57] because sometimes it's because
[47:59] amen
[48:01] we we regard so much
[48:04] to god says go ahead as he told balaam
[48:07] he said to balaam you know
[48:10] uh bayrack sent in numbers 22. you can
[48:14] read that sometime
[48:15] and i i
[48:17] i i would read it but it would take a
[48:19] little time
[48:20] to you know that are not familiar you
[48:23] write
[48:24] you know
[48:24] and you can go back to numbers 22
[48:27] and you can recognize that
[48:30] when uh
[48:32] israel was coming out of egypt and on
[48:35] their way to the promised land that
[48:38] uh
[48:39] mor the king of moab saw them
[48:42] and it called for balaam to come and
[48:44] curse
[48:45] which was a prophet call him to come to
[48:47] curse the children israel
[48:50] because you know
[48:52] sometimes people see that you bless and
[48:54] see what god is doing with you
[48:56] and so people want to see you curse
[49:00] and that's what because of jealousy
[49:02] because they thought they were
[49:03] intimidated by uh
[49:06] by the children of israel
[49:08] and people sometimes are intimidated by
[49:11] your life that you live and because of
[49:13] how god is blessing you and how what god
[49:16] is doing in your life so folks sometimes
[49:19] they get jealous and they want to see
[49:21] you cursed they don't want to see you
[49:23] because they think that what they got is
[49:26] in jeopardy
[49:28] so they think that uh you know
[49:31] israel wanted just to pass on through
[49:33] and go into their promises
[49:35] what god the king of land
[49:37] but uh bayrack uh
[49:40] uh
[49:42] he said uh uh balaam he sent his
[49:45] princess and sent him down now and so
[49:47] you go down and tell um
[49:50] balaam the king sent
[49:54] his princes to tell balaam
[49:56] if you curse this people then i'll give
[49:58] you such and such addition
[50:01] and they came back
[50:03] balaam sought god and
[50:05] and he said well
[50:08] i cannot do it
[50:10] you know
[50:10] i can't go with i can't come with y'all
[50:13] i can't go
[50:14] and they sent again
[50:16] other prince and tell them
[50:18] that i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you i'm
[50:20] gonna give you this and that i'm gonna
[50:21] add to what i said i'll give you and i'm
[50:24] just gonna give you more if you just
[50:26] come and curse this people
[50:29] he said let me
[50:30] go to god and pray and seek god i think
[50:34] it's worth whatever we do in life and
[50:37] whatever we do from day to day we need
[50:39] to consult god
[50:41] we need to ask god is this your will
[50:44] your your perfect will is this what you
[50:46] want done
[50:48] and i believe so many times we believe
[50:51] that just because we are who we are we
[50:53] can do anything we big and bad enough to
[50:56] do
[50:57] you know sometimes
[50:59] you know
[51:00] the school that we attend we usually
[51:02] look at it and we don't pray about it we
[51:05] find out hey uh the reason why i'm gonna
[51:07] go to this school because i can get this
[51:08] the reason why i'm gonna do this this
[51:10] job because it's on but we need to
[51:12] consult god god i want your perfect will
[51:15] to be done
[51:16] see because
[51:17] you you recognize when you're trying to
[51:19] do god a servant without it being at the
[51:21] will are we trying let us not find
[51:24] ourselves out of god's
[51:26] will perfect will and in his permissive
[51:29] will because he permitted it
[51:31] so um
[51:33] he said now
[51:35] he i'm gonna send some more prints you
[51:37] perhaps he said well
[51:38] these princes what no you know i'm gonna
[51:41] send my
[51:42] my right hand
[51:44] man now
[51:45] these are next to me in the throne tell
[51:47] them to come whatever he won't i i'll
[51:50] give it to him
[51:51] if he just come and curse the people
[51:56] they said well tell him go back and tell
[51:58] the king i can't do it
[52:00] god told me you won't he won't let me go
[52:03] so god really knows see sometimes god
[52:06] know what's in our hearts you see
[52:08] god knows what's in our hearts so he
[52:10] said the bailout
[52:12] balance see sometimes you don't even
[52:14] have to listen to something that you
[52:16] know is not the will of god you don't
[52:18] even listen to it just say go on you
[52:21] know
[52:21] but each time i think he he he he
[52:24] considered oh if i could do it
[52:27] you know what i'm saying oh
[52:29] you know we get excited about blessings
[52:32] and we get all working
[52:35] you know
[52:36] and then you go talk talk to god about
[52:38] it god said no
[52:39] don't do it
[52:41] and when we talk to god about it god
[52:43] said it's not
[52:44] no matter how excited and what they're
[52:46] offering that's not my will
[52:49] are you with me
[52:51] i don't want you to do it
[52:53] okay
[52:54] but god seeing that you're entertaining
[52:57] you know god look at you and see how you
[52:59] really entertaining it and he knows your
[53:02] heart right
[53:03] god sees your heart and what you desire
[53:05] and what you want
[53:07] it doesn't matter what you say
[53:09] i can't go i can't go god said well
[53:13] i'm gonna come to bail him
[53:16] you want to go in in other words i know
[53:18] you want to go
[53:19] and the next time they come and they
[53:21] send another i want you to go
[53:24] you listen go wear them
[53:27] but you when you go i want you to you
[53:29] can't i want you to say only what i say
[53:34] see
[53:35] so he went with him
[53:38] and then you remember the
[53:40] donkey began to talk with a man voice
[53:43] [Music]
[53:44] and bail him with him and beat him
[53:47] because the angel was getting to take
[53:49] bail of life see god allowed him to go
[53:51] but yet the angel was right there with a
[53:53] sword drawn back to take balaam's life
[53:56] but actually the donkey saw
[53:59] the angel
[54:00] but balaam was so you know sometimes we
[54:02] can't see
[54:04] because we're so blind by promotion and
[54:07] what we want to go in life and well how
[54:10] how high and what's being offered for us
[54:13] sometimes we're so blind but
[54:15] the the
[54:16] the donkey even saw
[54:19] but the man couldn't even see the angel
[54:21] maybe if he was spiritual enough he
[54:23] could see the angel
[54:25] if he wasn't so caught up with this what
[54:27] how
[54:28] well he could think about all the wealth
[54:30] and all the promotion that he's gonna
[54:32] get probably going down the road and the
[54:34] duck is stopping
[54:36] man what you doing stopping me on my
[54:38] turn i'm going to get
[54:40] you know
[54:41] so he he actually would and the doctor
[54:44] talking to him he didn't even realize
[54:46] the donkey was talking
[54:49] you know sometimes we so caught up the
[54:51] donkey talking
[54:52] oh you know
[54:54] somebody said the dog was talking
[54:57] it meant the cat was talking
[55:00] everything the birds was talking
[55:02] everything's trying to tell you don't do
[55:05] this and don't do that and you're going
[55:09] children telling you
[55:11] husband telling your wife telling you
[55:13] everybody telling you don't do it
[55:17] you're gonna listen why because you're
[55:20] thinking about what
[55:22] promotion
[55:24] what's what what what i'm getting off of
[55:26] your eyes ain't on it's not the will of
[55:29] god
[55:30] god don't want you to do that
[55:33] but you will continuously
[55:35] you're thinking about your own selfish
[55:37] desire
[55:39] my this is what i want and
[55:42] and god knows what you want amen
[55:45] so by the grace of god y'all know the
[55:48] story amen
[55:50] when balaam got ready to try to curse
[55:52] the people he blessed them
[55:56] amen
[55:57] so he could do nothing but what god said
[56:00] he blessed him and bale balak said did
[56:03] not call you up here to catch the people
[56:05] and you turn around you bless you say
[56:07] what god has done i cannot turn it
[56:09] around
[56:11] i can't do nothing about that i don't
[56:13] know i can only say what the lord say
[56:16] oh you look man
[56:18] so don't worry about the thing when the
[56:20] enemy try to curse you the enemy can't
[56:23] do nothing but bless you
[56:25] are you with me
[56:27] amen no matter what they do to try to
[56:30] stop you on the job in the school
[56:32] wherever you're endeavored just keep
[56:35] your heart right
[56:37] amen praise god bless them that curse
[56:40] you
[56:41] bless them that persecute you amen don't
[56:44] render evil for evil but overcome evil
[56:47] with good
[56:49] are you what man
[56:54] now
[56:55] by the grace of god
[56:56] so
[56:57] as we look
[56:59] at that particular incident
[57:01] then we understand that there were many
[57:03] incidents in the bible where people were
[57:07] permitted
[57:10] you know israel was permitted a king
[57:12] because they was not satisfied with
[57:15] samuel
[57:16] uh so god permitted them to have a king
[57:19] but the king was going to take him
[57:21] through some hardships but
[57:23] they would rather go through the
[57:24] hardships because they wanted to be like
[57:27] the rest of the people you know
[57:29] sometimes we want to be like the rest of
[57:30] the world you see what the oh the rest
[57:33] of the teenagers doing what the rest of
[57:35] the children doing amen they doing this
[57:38] they doing that and i feel deprived i'm
[57:41] a christian and why i can't do that
[57:44] those other people are christian but yet
[57:46] they they got their boyfriend their
[57:49] girlfriend and they're going out to
[57:52] party and i can't party
[57:56] you know
[57:57] they're drinking they're smoking their
[57:59] you know they're having um
[58:02] relationships outside of marriage and
[58:05] they're doing all kind of stuff i'm
[58:07] missing out
[58:10] and you seem to be deprived and uh
[58:13] you're in a jailhouse and i'm in prison
[58:16] i need to be
[58:19] free
[58:21] amen
[58:22] so here it is
[58:24] you know we we feel so deprived
[58:27] we feel so miserable we feel so
[58:30] uncomfortable being a christian not
[58:33] realizing the amen as the young prodigal
[58:35] son didn't know like realized that his
[58:38] father house was better than the pig pen
[58:40] that he was going to end up in
[58:43] the slop that uh that the way the devil
[58:45] was going to take him he didn't know
[58:47] where he was going to end up in and some
[58:50] folks don't know that they end up in
[58:52] hell by making the wrong choice
[58:55] are you what man
[58:56] we need to consider what god a will and
[58:59] purpose is for our lives
[59:02] not what we want but what god wants with
[59:05] us
[59:06] and for our lives but sometimes we so
[59:08] caught up in the moment till all we want
[59:11] to do is what mine i want to live in my
[59:14] life i'm going to live it the way i want
[59:16] to live it and whoa
[59:19] you know it's like
[59:21] amen that god don't wake us up in the
[59:23] morning god don't give us health and
[59:25] strength it we we get it because we are
[59:28] privileged to give in
[59:30] god is indebted to us and
[59:33] you know like god owed us amen
[59:36] something
[59:37] are you with me
[59:39] i i said god oh god i i don't know
[59:42] sometimes we get a little high-minded we
[59:44] get to get a little lifted up in pride
[59:46] we get a little uh amnesia we don't
[59:49] recognize that god is such a good god
[59:52] the bible said know ye that that the
[59:54] lord he's god it is him that
[59:57] made us
[59:59] not we ourselves are you with me
[1:00:02] amen god is a maker
[1:00:06] amen god amen is the part of we are the
[1:00:10] clay
[1:00:11] amen praise god thank god let him mold
[1:00:14] us and make us a vessel of honor
[1:00:19] are you with me
[1:00:20] lord not my will but let your
[1:00:24] i want your will your perfect will and i
[1:00:27] don't want to try to do you a service
[1:00:29] without it being your will
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:33] even though david with the ark of the
[1:00:35] covenant he wanted to uh you know it was
[1:00:38] in the hands of the enemy and
[1:00:40] and david wanted to come back
[1:00:43] to israel where
[1:00:45] the he wanted the presence of god was we
[1:00:47] know the presence of god with the ark
[1:00:50] and the ark of god and he sent them to
[1:00:53] go get the ark and bring it back home to
[1:00:56] its rightful place and all
[1:00:59] but you know
[1:01:00] and david wanted the ark to come back
[1:01:04] they went to get it but they put it on
[1:01:06] ox cots
[1:01:08] and when they went together they was
[1:01:10] bringing it back on oxcock and the ark
[1:01:13] was never to be carried
[1:01:15] on and when the ox cot
[1:01:18] uh when uh
[1:01:22] it stumbled
[1:01:24] because it was carried
[1:01:26] the oxen stomach and the looked
[1:01:29] like it was gonna fall
[1:01:32] one of the servants put forth his hand
[1:01:34] and
[1:01:35] he died
[1:01:37] you with me
[1:01:39] so what happened
[1:01:41] if he would have consulted the lord
[1:01:43] god wanted his presence to be with you
[1:01:46] but it was a way that god had ordained
[1:01:48] god provided way for that day
[1:01:51] are you with me
[1:01:53] and we're going to do it the way we want
[1:01:55] see sometimes we we just can't you know
[1:01:58] you know the art you know bring the
[1:02:01] presents back and the word back to the
[1:02:03] people and all that but it's a way that
[1:02:05] god want to do it
[1:02:07] you just can't do it because oh yes this
[1:02:10] is the will of god i know god said it i
[1:02:12] know god is with us and yeah
[1:02:15] all that is good
[1:02:18] but have you considered god have you
[1:02:20] prayed about it is it the will of god
[1:02:22] for you
[1:02:24] is it the will of god i know amen dustin
[1:02:27] did died and that one did this but what
[1:02:29] is the will of god for your life
[1:02:32] oh you look me you say well uh
[1:02:35] i've seen no no no
[1:02:37] what is the will of god for your life
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:41] see here in romans it tells us there's a
[1:02:44] mini-member body and all don't have the

[1:03:12] body
[1:03:14] god dealing with you as an individual

[1:07:19] channel of the spirit you'll find that

[1:08:01] i i started 15 first excuse me
[1:08:04] who when they were come down prayed for
[1:08:06] them
[1:08:08] that they might receive the holy ghost
[1:08:11] you know
[1:08:12] philip had a revival then samaritan
[1:08:15] and
[1:08:18] he baptized several folk
[1:08:21] but
[1:08:22] in miracles and signs and wonders went
[1:08:24] forth
[1:08:25] but the people still didn't have the
[1:08:26] holy ghost how many think sometimes
[1:08:29] miracles signed going forward
[1:08:31] people baptized in the name of the lord
[1:08:33] jesus christ
[1:08:34] and yet they don't have the holy ghost
[1:08:36] as a whole
[1:08:38] philip baptized them miracles and so
[1:08:40] forth and but they didn't have the holy
[1:08:43] ghost yet
[1:08:45] see sometimes people because they got
[1:08:46] baptized they think i got the holy ghost
[1:08:49] see that don't mean you got the holy
[1:08:51] ghost don't you see miracles right
[1:08:53] around you and signs and oneness yeah
[1:08:57] they didn't have the holy ghost yet
[1:09:00] so he says here
[1:09:02] for
[1:09:07] if you read this eighth chapter you see
[1:09:09] uh i i look at the 13th verse and and
[1:09:12] simon himself believe also simon was a
[1:09:15] witchcraft witch doctor a software root
[1:09:18] doctor
[1:09:20] you all know what root doctors is in

[1:09:26] wouldn't know oh they know i knew y'all
[1:09:28] too okay
[1:09:32] say and simon himself believe also
[1:09:36] and when he was baptized
[1:09:38] he continued with philip
[1:09:41] and one and behold in the what
[1:09:44] the miracles then signed which was what
[1:09:47] see sometimes that don't mean because of
[1:09:50] miracles and signs and wonders you know
[1:09:52] you can be around
[1:09:54] the holy ghost
[1:09:56] and you can see what the holy ghost does
[1:09:59] amen but to just to be around it and see
[1:10:02] what it does it doesn't mean that you
[1:10:04] got it
[1:10:06] because uh some uh the preacher got it
[1:10:09] uh a sister song song got it and mama
[1:10:12] got it that don't mean you got it
[1:10:14] oh i've seen the blind eyes open i seen
[1:10:17] the walking i even seen the dead
[1:10:20] raise
[1:10:21] but that you saw all of that but you
[1:10:23] that don't mean you got the holy ghost
[1:10:25] well i go to a church with the i know
[1:10:28] the uh count is here i heard sister
[1:10:30] betty give a testimony and i heard i saw
[1:10:33] brother frank and what god did for their
[1:10:36] lives oh i know god is moving
[1:10:39] but what about you
[1:10:41] you got to have your own fire
[1:10:44] amen you got to build your own fire
[1:10:47] you got to have the holy ghost for
[1:10:49] yourself
[1:10:51] are you with me
[1:10:53] now simon was a little bit
[1:10:55] he saw what was going on and he knew he
[1:10:57] was missing out on something though he
[1:10:59] had
[1:11:00] you know he could do some things with
[1:11:02] witchcraft but he knew that the holy
[1:11:04] ghost was doing things that he couldn't
[1:11:06] do
[1:11:08] amen so he got a little hey hey what's
[1:11:11] going on now
[1:11:13] the bible said simon bewitched the
[1:11:15] people i had the people all spelled by
[1:11:17] by his witchcraft
[1:11:19] but simon himself came and got back oh
[1:11:22] look
[1:11:23] i i better read on 14 verse 9 when the
[1:11:26] apostles which were jerusalem heard that
[1:11:28] samaria had received the word of god
[1:11:31] they sent unto them peter and john who
[1:11:34] when they were come down prayed for them
[1:11:36] that they might what
[1:11:39] receive the holy ghost
[1:11:42] are you with me
[1:11:44] we got to work this thing together
[1:11:48] we got to see amen the part that you
[1:11:50] play and the part that i play in part
[1:11:53] the sister so-and-so now you can't sing
[1:11:55] be a good prayer warrior
[1:11:59] don't don't try to say well
[1:12:01] she can sing unchained
[1:12:04] come on
[1:12:06] if you if you're a good league good type
[1:12:09] player don't you mess with the
[1:12:11] organ
[1:12:13] or don't you mess with the
[1:12:16] socks
[1:12:17] amen because god has to bless your
[1:12:20] fingers and you can play like god and
[1:12:22] somebody said well i can play the league
[1:12:24] gut talk too
[1:12:26] yeah you can
[1:12:28] but when you're trying to do god a
[1:12:29] servant without it being his will no you
[1:12:31] know god's will is his word and if you
[1:12:34] want to know whether or not it's the
[1:12:35] will of god for you you'll see whether
[1:12:37] or not god what
[1:12:39] blesses it
[1:12:42] and if god don't bless it don't try to
[1:12:43] bless it yourself
[1:12:48] you know folks will try to convince you
[1:12:51] i'm gonna tell you something how you
[1:12:52] know people out of the will of god they
[1:12:54] go around and try to convince everybody
[1:12:56] else that they're in the will of god
[1:13:01] i didn't say that that's just said
[1:13:05] [Laughter]
[1:13:12] okay so so you you understand
[1:13:17] y'all understand once folks are trying
[1:13:20] to convince you that it's the will of
[1:13:22] god for their life
[1:13:24] they're just trying to prove it to you
[1:13:26] and convince you nine out of ten
[1:13:28] is not the will of god
[1:13:31] because you don't have here to speak for
[1:13:32] itself
[1:13:34] god interprets his own word by what
[1:13:37] fulfilling it
[1:13:39] are you with me
[1:13:42] so uh by the grace of god i i i can't
[1:13:44] even finish this
[1:13:47] it's so good till i can't finish it
[1:13:49] brother fred
[1:13:51] but god undo what he said he'll do
[1:13:54] so we see here this man here he says
[1:13:58] for as yet for as yet he was falling
[1:14:01] upon none of them only they were
[1:14:02] baptized in what
[1:14:06] the father son holy ghost
[1:14:10] in the name of the what
[1:14:13] lord jesus where did they get that
[1:14:14] father son holy ghost from
[1:14:18] because they didn't know the name of the
[1:14:19] father son holy ghost they start
[1:14:21] repeating the title father son the holy
[1:14:23] ghost because they didn't know that
[1:14:25] jesus said i come in my father's name
[1:14:27] and you don't receive me but if another
[1:14:29] come in his own name him you would
[1:14:31] receive right
[1:14:32] jesus said and she should bring forth
[1:14:34] the son that i should call the name of
[1:14:35] jesus listen if he said baptized in the
[1:14:38] name of the father son holy ghost you
[1:14:39] would know the name of the son is jesus
[1:14:41] christ
[1:14:43] so you say well i know the name of the
[1:14:45] son
[1:14:46] and the confident which is the holy
[1:14:48] ghost the father's gonna send it in my
[1:14:50] name
[1:14:52] okay he's gonna send it in jesus name so
[1:14:54] you know the name of the holy ghost it's
[1:14:55] jesus because he said i'm walking with
[1:14:57] you and i shall be what
[1:14:59] the bible says without controversy the
[1:15:01] great is the mystery of god and this god
[1:15:02] was manifested in the flesh justified in
[1:15:05] the spirit scene of angels preaching to
[1:15:07] the gentiles believed only in the world
[1:15:09] see you up in the glory
[1:15:10] isn't that right
[1:15:12] same god amen god with us god in us
[1:15:16] amen
[1:15:18] the same god amen
[1:15:20] that was with us the same god god in us
[1:15:23] praise god
[1:15:26] emmanuel was which means interpreted god
[1:15:29] with us
[1:15:30] jesus was god with us
[1:15:33] are you with me
[1:15:36] so we are baptized in the name of the
[1:15:38] lord jesus because that's the way the
[1:15:40] book of acts had it
[1:15:43] are you with me
[1:15:45] and then
[1:15:48] laid their
[1:15:49] hands on them and they would receive
[1:15:52] what
[1:15:54] and when simon saw that through the land
[1:15:56] there on the apostles hands the holy
[1:15:59] ghost was given he offered them what
[1:16:04] let me tell you something a lot of folk
[1:16:07] think that
[1:16:08] amen that they can do that god is
[1:16:10] indebted to them because of the money
[1:16:14] they come to church and they put money
[1:16:16] in you see how people try to rule the
[1:16:17] church because of how much money they
[1:16:19] pay
[1:16:21] they think they
[1:16:23] i give so much money god owed me to
[1:16:25] church over me because i put so much
[1:16:27] money in there and
[1:16:29] and i i i don't have to put my money in
[1:16:31] there oh lord you think god care about
[1:16:34] your money
[1:16:35] do you think god is pope
[1:16:40] see people don't realize how rich god is
[1:16:44] amen
[1:16:46] god is if he was hungry he wouldn't ask
[1:16:48] you for nothing
[1:16:50] if he was thirsty he wouldn't even ask
[1:16:52] you for a drink
[1:16:54] amen
[1:16:55] that counts on a thousand heels down
[1:16:57] here
[1:16:59] amen i never saw what
[1:17:03] right
[1:17:04] oh lord
[1:17:06] isn't that right
[1:17:08] do y'all believe you would be all right
[1:17:10] doesn't matter
[1:17:12] amen god will take care of his children
[1:17:16] all you got to do is walk in his perfect
[1:17:18] will and god will take care of you
[1:17:22] he'll fight your battles
[1:17:25] he'll do whatever needs to be done if
[1:17:28] you walk in his perfect wheel
[1:17:32] oh yes
[1:17:33] god is a good god
[1:17:37] oh he wanted to bond with money
[1:17:40] i'm going to tell you something
[1:17:42] don't get your eyes on money
[1:17:44] praise god you get your eyes on money
[1:17:47] you get out the will of god
[1:17:49] because money don't perish
[1:17:52] what do you say
[1:17:54] he said
[1:17:56] saying give uh you know
[1:17:59] and peter said unto him
[1:18:01] thy money what
[1:18:03] not this 21st he said that money what
[1:18:07] prayer is with thee because thou had
[1:18:10] thought that the gift of god may be what
[1:18:16] some folks say i pay my tithes and my
[1:18:18] offering so i feel like the church old
[1:18:21] me when i get sick i'll leave the church
[1:18:23] out to pay my bills
[1:18:29] i lose a job i believe the church owed
[1:18:32] me
[1:18:35] are you what man yeah
[1:18:37] i don't mean that
[1:18:40] that but don't don't think that in your

[1:18:48] god around
[1:18:49] that i believe the saints will see about
[1:18:52] one another
[1:18:54] i believe that
[1:18:56] they meant the love of god is in the
[1:18:58] saints hard to love one another
[1:19:01] and to help one another
[1:19:03] amen they're not gonna let you down amen

[1:19:17] that was one of his things you think
[1:19:18] again
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:21] because god the church don't owe you
[1:19:24] because what you gave you gave it to god
[1:19:26] if you gave it to the church then church
[1:19:28] owe you everything
[1:19:31] are you with me what you do for the lord

[1:20:13] receive and not because he gonna bless
[1:20:15] you back
