[31:46] Matthew the 16th chapter
[31:51] very familiar text so I'm not going to
[31:53] read all of it I want to just go
[31:56] straight down to the 16 excuse me the
[31:59] 17th verse
[32:02] and we all know this talking about uh
[32:05] Jesus talking to Simon Peter after he
[32:08] asked him who the men say aye the son of
[32:10] man am
[32:11] but I'm going to take apart from another
[32:13] angle tonight not So Much from the angle
[32:17] that he usually but the 17th verse and
[32:19] Jesus answered and said unto him
[32:23] blessed are thou Simon Bojana
[32:26] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[32:30] unto thee but my Father which is in
[32:34] heaven
[32:35] and I say um I say also unto thee that
[32:40] thou on Peter
[32:42] and Upon This Rock
[32:46] I will build my church
[32:49] in the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[32:53] against it and I will give unto thee the
[32:58] Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[33:00] whatsoever thou shall bind on Earth
[33:03] shall be bind in heaven
[33:06] and whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth
[33:10] shall be loose in heaven then chart he
[33:15] his disciples that they should tell no
[33:17] man and he was Jesus the Christ
[33:21] father
[33:23] we thank you for your word
[33:25] now Lord I pray you blessed Lord and
[33:28] Quicken it
[33:29] in Jesus name amen amen let me be seated
[33:36] I want to just just for a few minutes
[33:39] and not mean to be long at all tonight
[33:43] I want to speak to you in a little
[33:46] thought of God's Church
[33:49] in God's Church
[33:53] and
[33:55] As We Know
[33:59] that
[34:00] there are many
[34:02] claims
[34:06] that people make
[34:11] of being God's Church
[34:18] for a long time now
[34:21] no matter who you talk to basically and
[34:25] what form of religious practices they
[34:29] have
[34:31] they want to believe that they are God's
[34:33] Church
[34:36] but I believe that the Bible
[34:41] identifies
[34:44] that God's church has never been a
[34:50] building structure
[34:53] of a natural building
[34:58] I believe it was David one time that
[35:01] wanted to build God a house but he told
[35:03] no
[35:05] you have too much blood on your hand
[35:07] David
[35:09] you said one place I went from 10th to
[35:11] tent
[35:13] and he never had a building
[35:17] that he had Associated that
[35:21] this is my building structure
[35:29] have you noticed the evening of Old
[35:31] Testament
[35:34] when God was dealing with Israel
[35:42] they were a people
[35:47] of God
[35:49] as long as they were in Egypt
[35:55] and Egypt was a type of the world
[36:00] always like to say that God is not a
[36:04] mixer he's a separator
[36:09] from the beginning he separate light
[36:12] from Darkness he separates
[36:17] and as long as Israel stayed in Egypt
[36:20] they were mixed up with the things of
[36:23] the world they uh were associated with
[36:27] the things of the world
[36:29] until they begin to stop crying out for
[36:32] God to deliver them
[36:37] and you know when God begins to move
[36:42] upon the people
[36:45] in such a way it causes them to
[36:50] uh leave out from what they were doing
[36:53] to come to something that God was doing
[37:02] and when they came out of Egypt and
[37:05] going to the promised land
[37:09] away from the Taskmaster the way from
[37:12] the Egyptians
[37:16] because God wanted his people to be a
[37:19] peculiar
[37:21] separated people
[37:26] and God
[37:28] always wanted his people to be peculiar
[37:33] not so much because of how they dress or
[37:36] or things like that no that's not what
[37:39] God was interested in
[37:42] but God was
[37:44] going to do our work with his people
[37:49] God people were going to be led by his
[37:53] spirit and his Spirit only
[37:58] not ruled by a man not ruled by a
[38:02] hypocrisy of Cardinals and uh
[38:06] headquarters systems that was never
[38:09] God's system
[38:14] God's spirit
[38:18] don't he work through men
[38:22] but those men were led by the spirit of
[38:26] God
[38:28] they did not do what they want you
[38:33] they were under the influence in the
[38:37] inspiration of God
[38:41] they had no Creed but Christ
[38:44] they had no law but the word
[38:48] they had no psychology of theology or
[38:52] methodology whatever you want to know no
[38:54] they had one thing
[38:56] that was God's word
[39:02] and as long as the people stayed with
[39:07] that word see
[39:12] as long as they stayed with God were now
[39:17] it must be written
[39:21] I'll be the Bible said one place said
[39:23] that all scriptures are given by
[39:27] inspiration of who
[39:29] the bishop
[39:31] headquarters
[39:33] no man can lay any claims on what God is
[39:38] doing
[39:42] this church that God is called his
[39:45] church
[39:48] they were a peculiar set aside for the
[39:52] word church means called out and
[39:56] separated for the use of God
[39:59] and God always wanted to be the one to
[40:04] lead his people
[40:10] and when Satan came in
[40:14] and begin to start the falling in
[40:18] scattering the flock
[40:20] bringing in false teaching bringing in
[40:24] man-made ideas bringing in customs of of
[40:30] witches and voodles and all kind of
[40:33] satanic teaching and they Institute it
[40:36] and then mix it in
[40:39] with church
[40:43] and what it did it called the hybrid
[40:48] it caused a a false Union
[40:54] that God no longer
[40:58] could be in that because God is a
[41:02] separator
[41:05] the word of God see
[41:08] the Bible the very word of God for your
[41:12] hour for your day
[41:16] when God still as he still are using men
[41:22] using people of God
[41:26] with his word that he gives them
[41:32] and they are so under the influence
[41:35] of the Holy Ghost that they must know
[41:39] that I'm staying with what's written in
[41:42] the Bible
[41:48] and if that word is God's word like it's
[41:53] written
[41:54] then that word will then produce
[41:59] Christ again
[42:02] it'll produce that very life of God in
[42:07] the people that hears it and believe and
[42:11] act on it
[42:14] but they must know that it's God's word
[42:22] one deviation
[42:28] one little
[42:30] mispiece that you put in
[42:34] that word
[42:36] is like this it's like if you go to the
[42:39] doctor you know in this medicine that
[42:42] they give us
[42:44] if they want water it down it'll have
[42:47] the right kind of effect
[42:53] but because they don't actually give us
[42:56] you know that the real antidote
[43:02] then we can't get the right kind of
[43:04] effect
[43:05] and it was supposed to produce
[43:09] so is it with God's word
[43:14] God want the word of God to have an
[43:16] effect on the people
[43:20] God's word that he gives us always lead
[43:24] us to him
[43:25] nobody else
[43:28] no no other man no we don't live no
[43:31] other body out but Jesus Christ
[43:34] he must and he alone must be the center
[43:40] of what we are preaching what we are
[43:43] believing and who we are putting the
[43:46] people to
[43:48] when you put the people to anybody else
[43:51] it becomes Antichrist
[43:59] got to stay with the word
[44:03] it's important
[44:06] that's why Jesus said if I be lifted up
[44:10] see he
[44:12] nobody if I be lifted then I'll draw
[44:17] see we need to know that we need to lift
[44:21] Jesus up
[44:24] above anything I thank God we got good
[44:28] pictures good people good Minister but
[44:31] my focus is Jesus Christ
[44:36] great men oh Dynamite that don't make
[44:39] any difference Jesus Christ
[44:43] the center
[44:46] must be
[44:49] in order for the word to have the right
[44:51] kind of effect
[44:53] I'm learning this and I'm teaching this
[44:57] back at Marion that
[45:00] we must have the right Focus
[45:05] and when the people of God begin to
[45:07] follow to see the people in these days
[45:09] are almost been following anything
[45:12] all I gotta do is have a little
[45:14] religious background Boop
[45:18] a little religious custom Boop
[45:22] people follow
[45:24] I mean sir God say that and people
[45:26] hungry they eat out of the trash can
[45:28] they they're looking for something that
[45:30] real and when they hear all of these
[45:33] things they said maybe this it
[45:36] or maybe that's it and they begin to
[45:39] follow especially something new
[45:45] everybody wants something that nobody
[45:47] ever heard before but let me tell you
[45:48] something
[45:49] this Bible
[45:52] was been here
[45:55] it's the only book
[46:01] if you ever heard of that's been the
[46:03] most debatable book there is on the
[46:06] Earth
[46:09] why
[46:11] is one of the biggest tricks the devil
[46:13] ever did
[46:15] they get the people away from this write
[46:18] your own Bible
[46:22] put another interpretation to it
[46:25] they'll make it so that people can
[46:28] really understand what the Bible is
[46:30] talking about they will evicted the Holy
[46:33] Ghost
[46:36] see in all the good uh ideas that may be
[46:40] even good maybe
[46:42] but God has one way
[46:46] and Jesus said
[46:48] I am no way
[46:51] ah not us
[46:54] not them
[46:55] he said I am the way the truth and the
[47:00] what
[47:01] so no matter what you think about it or
[47:05] a better way system that's what we
[47:07] always are so smart in that what a
[47:09] better way
[47:10] are easier you know
[47:13] I'm more appealing way or we do it so we
[47:18] can draw the people no no no if the
[47:21] Gospel of Jesus Christ don't draw
[47:27] see we're not looking for appealings
[47:32] that's why the Bible said there's a way
[47:35] that seemeth right to a man
[47:39] there's a way that seemeth right to a
[47:43] lot of preachers
[47:45] but if it's not the way Jesus said I am
[47:48] the way
[47:50] see he was is the way even now today the
[47:55] word is the way
[47:58] that's why when coming to Christ
[48:03] and if he is the head in the center of
[48:05] your life
[48:08] you're always check with him
[48:13] because the church or the preachers
[48:15] might get off but you always can go back
[48:18] to this Bible
[48:20] did not the Bible say prove all things
[48:24] how do you prove it
[48:27] this is the blueprint y'all
[48:31] and if you try to change the blueprint
[48:34] you won't get there
[48:37] like you want to because you went
[48:40] another Direction
[48:45] see
[48:48] that's why even Jesus said this he said
[48:51] now
[48:53] I'm gonna go away he said it's expedient
[48:55] that I do because if I don't then the
[48:58] comforter who I send in my name won't
[49:02] come
[49:04] see
[49:06] one comfort of the Holy Ghost
[49:12] there remember one Holy Ghost
[49:15] and it's the same Holy Ghost they had in
[49:17] the Bible
[49:19] ought to be the same Holy Ghost me you
[49:22] God
[49:24] if there's another Holy Ghost it's the
[49:26] wrong ghost
[49:30] if your Holy Ghost don't lead you to the
[49:33] truth of God's word for you hour your
[49:36] day that's the wrong Holy Ghost
[49:41] the Holy Ghost will lead you to some
[49:43] particular place where men say they
[49:47] established
[49:49] I believe Paul said that he said now I
[49:52] have laid the foundation
[49:55] see
[49:57] Paul said I laid it
[50:02] he said be careful how you build it
[50:08] you said because if any man think that
[50:10] he's spiritual
[50:15] you will say even if an angel
[50:18] would come and preach anything different
[50:21] I know a lot of people don't like Paul
[50:27] but Paul wrote
[50:29] the New Testament
[50:32] basically Church
[50:35] and he established it upon not upon
[50:37] himself
[50:39] remember you remember Paul before we
[50:42] came home he was Saul
[50:44] he actually was persecuting the Church
[50:46] of God
[50:48] until God got a hold of him
[50:51] he was one of the main ones that were
[50:54] threatening had Stefan and those killed
[50:58] because he was a part of a system
[51:02] that they thought that they were
[51:04] changing
[51:07] that custom
[51:09] a religious practices
[51:12] Paul had letters to persecute them
[51:17] throw me in prison kill them
[51:20] had them killed
[51:22] but when God got a hold of Saul
[51:26] he had to struck him blind
[51:31] could God
[51:33] I'd like to say this too
[51:35] God's church is chosen by him
[51:46] if some man call you or some woman to
[51:48] call you
[51:51] it's not the right one
[51:55] God calls
[51:57] God chosen
[52:01] let me read that
[52:06] the book of
[52:08] Ephesus or Ephesians
[52:16] let me say it like this God people are
[52:19] hand-picked by him
[52:24] that's why a lot of times so many people
[52:27] they healed a call but
[52:30] they're hearing the wrong voice
[52:36] and I can't never forget I I honestly
[52:39] believe it was all in my heart I know I
[52:40] said over and over I honestly believe
[52:43] this
[52:44] that every
[52:46] Christian
[52:48] that God calls
[52:51] you must hear his voice
[52:56] it got to be his for now God works
[53:00] through people
[53:03] but I've always said that voice will
[53:06] always carry you back to the god of the
[53:09] word
[53:12] and if that voice is taking you anywhere
[53:14] else then back to God it's the wrong
[53:17] voice because he said my sheep will heal
[53:20] my eye
[53:23] no my music
[53:26] my tongues
[53:28] on my shout I'm a praise dancers
[53:32] no my sheep healed my voice
[53:40] I honestly believe it I say it again
[53:42] that you must hear the voice of God for
[53:48] yourself
[53:51] a lot of times you know we raised our
[53:54] children and we ought to do that in the
[53:57] admonition of the Lord
[54:00] but it come to a place then that they
[54:03] must have a personalized experience with
[54:06] God themselves
[54:09] we'll need to do this now until they get
[54:12] to
[54:14] must something must happen somewhere in
[54:17] their life that the Holy Spirit began to
[54:21] deal with them
[54:24] because if it don't
[54:26] when Mom and Dad is gone I turned it
[54:29] back they'll do other things
[54:32] but if they ever can get uh to a place
[54:36] that God deal with them one-on-one
[54:42] and they get convicted by the Holy Ghost
[54:44] then Mom and they don't have to worry no
[54:47] more
[54:52] I believe I heard somebody said until
[54:54] you get the Holy Ghost your parents your
[54:56] Holy Ghost
[54:58] if they have it themselves
[55:01] because they only want to instruct you
[55:03] to the things of God
[55:05] the owner owner trying to lead you to
[55:08] that person I'm gonna tell you something
[55:09] the Holy Ghost is a person
[55:13] and that person of Jesus Christ wants to
[55:16] get in US
[55:20] so many people claim that because
[55:23] they're the church because they feel the
[55:25] spirit let me tell you something then
[55:27] someday you don't feel nothing
[55:30] you feel sick
[55:33] you feel so bad in fact he gonna die
[55:36] so it got to be more Than A Feeling
[55:39] it's okay to feel it
[55:42] but you know you got it
[55:45] because if you got it even you ain't
[55:48] feeling good he'll keep you
[55:52] even when you get weak in yourself he is
[55:56] a keeper
[56:01] and he just gonna keep you when things
[56:03] go good
[56:05] he give you a battling thing going bad
[56:11] yeah
[56:12] about the longer they up on the mountain
[56:14] Hallelujah praise praise praise but when
[56:19] the time to go in the valley
[56:22] I don't know
[56:24] or whether I'm saved
[56:26] I thought I was
[56:29] no no no no no if you got like the Bible
[56:32] said
[56:33] regardless of what you're going through
[56:35] regardless of what you're dealing with
[56:37] you'll still know God is a keeper
[56:43] I'm gonna tell you something young and
[56:45] old people you need a keeper
[56:48] somebody to keep you
[56:51] when you can't keep you you need
[56:53] somebody else to keep you
[56:55] amen see do you have some death in your
[56:58] life that you get vulnerable you get a
[57:00] little weakly and discouraged at that
[57:03] time you will need to know my keeper
[57:06] kept me
[57:09] there come a time you don't have no
[57:11] friends
[57:13] nobody
[57:15] seem like they care or understand what
[57:18] you going through let me tell you
[57:20] something he cares
[57:23] and he'll be a real fan
[57:27] at all times not when you good you know
[57:31] how buddies do
[57:33] you know you stick with me we Blood
[57:35] Brothers we blood a sister oh yeah we
[57:38] good to go and something come up I don't
[57:41] know about that one
[57:44] see but God will even stick with you in
[57:46] the tough times
[57:50] I believe even doing them tough times
[57:51] you really know whether you got it
[57:57] there comes sometimes sometimes you say
[57:59] well I don't know how I made it
[58:03] then you say oh yeah God took me through
[58:14] do they see him alone
[58:18] but you are not alone did not Jesus say
[58:21] I'll be with you even in you I'll never
[58:24] leave you never forsake you
[58:31] oh yeah
[58:34] God's Church
[58:37] also in the church with power
[58:44] when I talk about God Church a church a
[58:47] people
[58:49] see God just and raise us up with
[58:52] nothing
[58:55] but God give you something
[58:58] fight the devil with
[59:03] because he knows you're going to ever
[59:05] serve that you're gonna have to deal
[59:06] with situations and conditions he know
[59:09] you'll get sick he know you have trials
[59:11] and tribulations
[59:15] that's why he told the disciple me
[59:17] before they went out and preach he said
[59:19] now go to Jerusalem first
[59:23] he said entirely there because I got to
[59:25] give you something
[59:28] you see that and when I give you that
[59:30] promise of the father then you can go
[59:33] and be my Witnesses
[59:37] see because he knew how already Peter
[59:40] already acted before the Holy Ghost came
[59:45] the very one he gave the keys to
[59:49] but notice this now God let me read it
[59:53] first
[59:57] you think God gave Peter the keys to
[1:00:00] lose Peter
[1:00:02] I don't think so
[1:00:06] Ephesians 1 and 3.
[1:00:10] he said blessed be the God and father of
[1:00:12] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:15] who had blessed us with all spiritual
[1:00:17] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:00:21] according as he had chosen Us in who
[1:00:29] before when
[1:00:32] so you were chosen by God before the
[1:00:35] foundation of the world you just didn't
[1:00:37] know it
[1:00:40] God already knew
[1:00:45] you
[1:00:49] that's why I hear people say a lot of
[1:00:51] time oh I come to God when I get ready
[1:00:53] hmm
[1:00:56] I don't think so you might come
[1:01:01] that'll mean God would accept you
[1:01:06] you can't come to God when you that must
[1:01:09] God must call
[1:01:12] and honestly many are called but a few
[1:01:17] a trolling in the elect
[1:01:21] May the people can come and hear it but
[1:01:25] they can't endure
[1:01:27] see
[1:01:30] it those that can endure to the end
[1:01:35] that's why the Bible said they'll be
[1:01:37] such a great Falling Away
[1:01:40] because they can't endure
[1:01:44] they couldn't take
[1:01:46] or they wasn't chosen by God before they
[1:01:50] they come to join a church they shake
[1:01:52] the hand and I put the name on but
[1:01:55] that's not God's Church
[1:01:59] I read the Bible say one place if you
[1:02:01] have not the spirit of Christ you are
[1:02:03] never his
[1:02:06] you see how God identify his church with
[1:02:08] his spirit
[1:02:09] only with God don't get the church
[1:02:12] Spirit don't get the Pastoral Spirit
[1:02:14] don't get nobody else Spirit but get the
[1:02:17] Holy Spirit
[1:02:18] [Music]
[1:02:22] I found out to be sober in time when
[1:02:24] you're talking to people they're more
[1:02:26] excited because of of what they church
[1:02:28] say or what their Bishop tell them
[1:02:30] that's all right in a way but I got to
[1:02:33] hear from God
[1:02:36] you must know your call and chosen by
[1:02:40] him
[1:02:42] and him alone
[1:02:46] it must be a one welfare
[1:02:53] you and God
[1:02:55] have a relationship
[1:02:59] and sometimes you can't explain it
[1:03:02] but you know that something is calling
[1:03:04] you
[1:03:06] something is telling you get your life
[1:03:08] right
[1:03:12] all of us the Bible say one place that
[1:03:14] all of us in time past had our
[1:03:16] conversation according to the world
[1:03:18] requested parents of the air
[1:03:20] you know going after the lust of the
[1:03:22] flesh
[1:03:24] we were born by Nature to do those
[1:03:27] things
[1:03:29] we couldn't help that God don't hold you
[1:03:31] accountable for that
[1:03:33] but when he hold you accountable for and
[1:03:35] when he has made a way for you to get
[1:03:37] out of it and then you reject the way
[1:03:41] that God Made For You
[1:03:44] see now I have to say it again there is
[1:03:47] a way that seemeth right
[1:03:52] it must be God's way Brother John what's
[1:03:56] God's way the word
[1:03:59] if it ain't the word way it's not God's
[1:04:03] way
[1:04:06] that's what one of the reasons why God
[1:04:08] sent us you know what he did in this
[1:04:11] hour to bring us back
[1:04:15] to him again because
[1:04:17] if you know us the religious word had
[1:04:19] drifted so far in the history of the
[1:04:21] church we saw how they came in and and
[1:04:24] the people begin to just backslide
[1:04:28] they begin to mix things with the word
[1:04:31] they begin to bring in all kind of
[1:04:33] custom they're going to bring in all
[1:04:35] kind of days they begin to bring in all
[1:04:37] kind of man-made difficult to bring in
[1:04:40] all kind of things and put it in a
[1:04:43] Christian format
[1:04:46] and say oh this is our church
[1:04:51] and it probably is your church
[1:04:55] but I'm talking about God's Church
[1:05:00] God's Church believe the word they act
[1:05:03] on the word they live the word
[1:05:07] they just don't talk it they walk it
[1:05:10] they're living not this Sunday Monday
[1:05:13] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[1:05:14] Saturday
[1:05:16] it's a daily life living
[1:05:20] that God's people walking in that life
[1:05:26] in the spirit of God
[1:05:31] May the Bible said Christ he came to
[1:05:33] reconcile us
[1:05:35] back
[1:05:37] to God to bring us back
[1:05:40] so we all have one of stray
[1:05:45] and just as God called Egypt Israel
[1:05:48] Egypt he called us out of the system
[1:05:50] organized religion system
[1:05:54] Book of Revelation 17 and 18 he told us
[1:05:57] because mystery Babylon Has Fallen
[1:06:02] he began to make a call
[1:06:05] and begin to tell his people come out of
[1:06:07] her
[1:06:08] because God's people is in every Church
[1:06:13] but they must come out
[1:06:18] they must come out but they must go in
[1:06:21] so they can go up
[1:06:24] come out come in go up
[1:06:28] come out of the thing the world be
[1:06:30] separated say it the Lord
[1:06:33] and I receive you don't be contaminated
[1:06:35] with the world's system let me kind of
[1:06:39] read something just out of our footnote
[1:06:41] this is
[1:06:54] you said the New Testament is usually
[1:06:56] referred to as a local group of
[1:06:58] Christians in this sense a church is an
[1:07:02] assembly
[1:07:03] of baptized Believers under the
[1:07:07] discipline of the word of God
[1:07:12] baptized
[1:07:14] not by water on them but by spirit
[1:07:18] under the discipline of the word
[1:07:24] and that's why God had to restore the
[1:07:28] truth of the word back to the Believers
[1:07:32] in this hour if that don't don't happen
[1:07:35] the people that never can come back to
[1:07:37] what's right
[1:07:40] because every man got an idea that
[1:07:42] they're right
[1:07:43] that this is right you know that this is
[1:07:46] how I believe it and this is how and no
[1:07:48] doubt they're sincere people
[1:07:51] but let me tell you something we can't
[1:07:53] go on what I think is right
[1:07:57] we need we need an absolute
[1:08:04] we need certain
[1:08:06] something that's certain of God the son
[1:08:09] of God
[1:08:13] because if not we guessing
[1:08:16] we're pursuing without Authority
[1:08:20] don't know whether it's for sure or or
[1:08:23] maybe uh
[1:08:25] um because
[1:08:26] um it just we did it for a long time and
[1:08:29] all of that kind of stuff or my mama my
[1:08:32] great grandparents them did it that was
[1:08:35] good for them
[1:08:37] but we're living in the light of another
[1:08:40] age
[1:08:43] we notice the difficult revelation
[1:08:45] that church there that lasts layout and
[1:08:48] see a church
[1:08:52] they have got sold to a place
[1:08:55] so prosperous with materialistic things
[1:08:59] that they put God out the church
[1:09:06] look at the condition
[1:09:09] they put God out because they couldn't
[1:09:12] tell him we are rich
[1:09:15] we are increased with goods and we have
[1:09:19] need of nothing
[1:09:22] wow
[1:09:25] that's what they were telling God
[1:09:28] obviously he was on the outside knocking
[1:09:32] would y'all let me back in
[1:09:36] I want to do something in your life
[1:09:40] no we are rich
[1:09:45] we building our own Tower to heaven
[1:09:52] in other words they're saying something
[1:09:54] like this baby
[1:09:56] the way the Bible it says the old way
[1:10:01] and they said that way don't work no
[1:10:03] more
[1:10:06] wow
[1:10:09] that way don't give the young people
[1:10:12] nothing to do
[1:10:14] it's not appealing to because the world
[1:10:16] see has a lot of appealing that their
[1:10:19] young people appeals to
[1:10:22] in a sense that it's true
[1:10:28] but the Bible said the ways of sin is
[1:10:30] death
[1:10:32] the gift of God is eternal life all
[1:10:34] you're gonna follow in the world is
[1:10:37] misery
[1:10:39] pleasure for a season when the season
[1:10:42] over
[1:10:43] you get tired of doing anything
[1:10:46] over and over next day you gotta do the
[1:10:48] same thing I want to be happy you found
[1:10:51] something else wrong to do sinful that
[1:10:53] don't make you keep on doing it you get
[1:10:55] tired gotta find something else to do
[1:10:57] you gotta find something else to do
[1:10:58] gotta find something you're trying to
[1:11:01] find peace and happiness in all the
[1:11:05] wrong places
[1:11:09] young and old Pleasures listen
[1:11:14] we'll never ever take the place
[1:11:19] of the joy of God and the love of God in
[1:11:22] your heart
[1:11:24] what you're really looking for is God
[1:11:29] he really really really loves you
[1:11:33] he prove it
[1:11:36] he took your place
[1:11:38] he took your sin upon him that way you
[1:11:43] don't have to live like that
[1:11:47] living like animals
[1:11:51] like dogs going to spray all about no no
[1:11:55] no you're a God child
[1:12:01] you God Sons you God daughters
[1:12:04] God said I got a better life
[1:12:07] oh I know it don't look popular
[1:12:11] because even you know everybody is
[1:12:13] telling us oh
[1:12:15] you don't have to do all that you can
[1:12:17] still do that and you can still do that
[1:12:19] because that's what we always did that
[1:12:22] don't make it right
[1:12:28] see to love God
[1:12:30] but first to understand he love you
[1:12:35] yeah it ain't no fake
[1:12:38] when God tell you he love you he love
[1:12:41] you
[1:12:42] and he proved that he went to the lowest
[1:12:48] he left his throne
[1:12:50] in heaven to come to Earth
[1:12:55] even as a child
[1:12:58] they'll grow up as a child
[1:13:01] so he even know what the children is
[1:13:04] going through
[1:13:08] obviously he could be touched with the
[1:13:10] feeling of our infirmities he know what
[1:13:13] it's like to be poor
[1:13:15] homeless
[1:13:17] talking about spit on
[1:13:19] ridicued
[1:13:23] and by the way he never owned the house
[1:13:27] hmm
[1:13:30] never owned apartment
[1:13:33] never owned a horse in a buggy
[1:13:37] never on none of those things
[1:13:41] why did he do it to let you know those
[1:13:45] things don't make you what you are I do
[1:13:49] cars and houses and clothes and
[1:13:52] prestiges and and don't they don't make
[1:13:55] you who you are God makes you who you
[1:13:57] are
[1:13:58] good after all who is the one that wakes
[1:14:02] you up
[1:14:04] who is the one give you health in the
[1:14:08] script
[1:14:11] and yet we want to acknowledge that God
[1:14:15] is real
[1:14:17] that's why I serve him
[1:14:22] he didn't prove it to me
[1:14:25] yes sir he doesn't prove it to me he's
[1:14:28] real I heard but now I see
[1:14:33] a lot of time we hear but you need to
[1:14:36] see you need you probably say old taste
[1:14:39] and see that the Lord he's what
[1:14:44] have you tried him yet
[1:14:47] have you tested to see oh this is good
[1:14:50] here
[1:14:51] so you think oh I'm having fun as a
[1:14:54] young person that guy always told me
[1:14:56] when I was uh incarcerated he told me he
[1:14:58] said real he said you sure you want to
[1:15:01] go all the way like that he said I hate
[1:15:02] to see you you backslide you know
[1:15:05] because you are confounded and you get
[1:15:07] out then you want to go back in the
[1:15:09] world and I said no Mike I say I am
[1:15:12] convinced
[1:15:14] I haven't been on the other side of the
[1:15:16] fence
[1:15:18] and I know I said by the way that's why
[1:15:21] I'm doing this predicament
[1:15:23] because the other side I chose was the
[1:15:26] wrong way I said what God was rich and
[1:15:29] don't you know that young man when I
[1:15:31] even left he came by my house
[1:15:35] to check me out
[1:15:38] in order to proceed whether you that I'm
[1:15:41] going back real
[1:15:45] no Mike
[1:15:46] I love God even more so
[1:15:50] he was a Jehovah Witness God
[1:15:54] you see I'm glad to see that because so
[1:15:56] many he said so many people
[1:15:59] picked that up when they're away but
[1:16:01] when they get out
[1:16:03] they go back to where I said Mike I said
[1:16:06] I have been on both sides of the road I
[1:16:09] said I'm gonna tell you something even
[1:16:11] before I got this other side I was
[1:16:14] raised
[1:16:16] to do that which is right I chose the
[1:16:18] wrong way
[1:16:20] I want to tell you young people tonight
[1:16:21] don't choose the wrong way choose the
[1:16:24] right way
[1:16:26] Jesus is the way
[1:16:29] Jesus is your answer to your happiness
[1:16:34] young sisters please
[1:16:36] please young sisters young Brothers my
[1:16:39] younger sister please
[1:16:41] don't allow the devil to destroy you
[1:16:47] because he don't love you now
[1:16:50] he don't love you he all he want to do
[1:16:53] yeah give you this or give it and then
[1:16:55] at the end of it he want to make your
[1:16:58] life so miserable
[1:17:01] that when you think God don't even care
[1:17:04] about you
[1:17:06] but I want to tell you in event God
[1:17:08] cares
[1:17:11] God cares God's Church
[1:17:14] I see why the servant of God said God
[1:17:17] ought to be happy people
[1:17:21] after all what you got to be sad about
[1:17:25] we let these things in this world
[1:17:27] condition us
[1:17:29] our happiness
[1:17:31] they don't predict my happiness God
[1:17:34] doesn't die they gave me happiness
[1:17:37] yes even in the midst of what you're
[1:17:39] going through I still got joy
[1:17:44] I'm attending the church make another
[1:17:46] night I said let me say something I
[1:17:48] don't need even music to praise God I
[1:17:50] said because this Joy I got is go beyond
[1:17:52] music
[1:17:54] I just think about the goodness of God
[1:17:57] and all that he's done for me
[1:18:02] and when you get your own testimony of
[1:18:05] what God done for you regardless of how
[1:18:08] you feel I thank God for his Mercy
[1:18:12] how many you think of his Mercy

[1:21:20] [Music]

[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:49] God Is Right
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:22:00] what would I say now
[1:22:03] God is
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:38] God's church amen you know it's a couple
[1:22:41] things well Jeremiah Was preaching
[1:22:43] tonight I was thinking about you know
[1:22:45] one of the things he was saying about
[1:22:47] how you know young and and people say
[1:22:50] you waste your life you know I remember
[1:22:53] when I first started walking with Lord
[1:22:55] and somebody older way older they told
[1:22:59] me they says you ain't got to live that
[1:23:01] way
[1:23:02] they told me that says you're gonna
[1:23:04] waste your whole youth
[1:23:06] and then it says then you're gonna get
[1:23:08] older you're gonna wish you hadn't
[1:23:10] wasted your whole youth you're gonna
[1:23:11] find out you didn't have to do all that
[1:23:14] that's what they told me but the thing
[1:23:16] was it wasn't it wasn't a burden to live
[1:23:19] that way
[1:23:21] it was a joy because God had did
[1:23:23] something for me now if it's a burden to
[1:23:26] live that way it's a difference
[1:23:28] but like brother Jeremiah was saying the
[1:23:30] night you don't been on both sides
[1:23:33] you saw the pleasure of sitting for a
[1:23:34] season That season was over with
[1:23:37] you saw both sides but when God did
[1:23:40] something in your life it wasn't a
[1:23:42] struggle you wasn't living that way just
[1:23:44] struggling to live that way but it was
[1:23:46] easy
[1:23:47] like they sang that little song is so
[1:23:49] easy to love you Jesus because you're
[1:23:52] wonderful and it was easy through the
[1:23:54] dark times it was easy all those lonely
[1:23:58] nights and all those lonely prayers and
[1:24:00] all those things sometimes seem like you
[1:24:03] walking alone but it was all right
[1:24:04] because God was there with you the whole
[1:24:06] time
[1:24:07] and every time he brought you through
[1:24:09] this and he brought you through that you
[1:24:11] realize that you were moving somewhere
[1:24:13] in God that you weren't the same to
[1:24:15] where you were that where you used to be
[1:24:17] so then as the trials came you were
[1:24:20] getting better you were getting deeper
[1:24:23] in God and then you came to the place
[1:24:24] now that you can't turn back because he
[1:24:27] did so much for you you ain't got
[1:24:29] nothing to go back to you don't cut so
[1:24:31] much off your life you know he doesn't
[1:24:33] brought you so far you can't turn back
[1:24:35] now Hallelujah only thing you can do is
[1:24:38] just keep going and God how many thank
[1:24:40] God for that tonight so I want to say
[1:24:42] you ain't wasting time with God not one
[1:24:45] moment that you that you live with God
[1:24:47] is wasting not one moment because he'll
[1:24:50] never forget that he'll always remember
[1:24:52] he'll bring back to your remembrance
[1:24:54] things you've done but when he blessing
[1:24:56] you that's your body even forgot about
[1:24:58] yourself but God is that good how many
[1:25:01] believe that tonight amen God's church
[1:25:03] we thank God for the word tonight thank
[1:25:06] God for all of you that come and press
[1:25:08] your way Amen Let Us stand tonight God

[1:25:15] Lord we never want to uh close down the
[1:25:18] altar but if you all want to come and
[1:25:20] tonight and give a light to the Lord and
[1:25:22] you want to surrender your life that we
[1:25:25] always leave that door open because God
[1:25:27] is always waiting come on he's he's not
[1:25:30] like we were saying the other day that
[1:25:31] kind that is going to force himself on
[1:25:33] you but he's always waiting on those
[1:25:36] that He said who whatsoever will let him
[1:25:38] come amen and he'll always be willing to
[1:25:41] receive you how many believe that
