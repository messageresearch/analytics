Now Lord, we commit the word of God in your hand in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. The book of first Corinthians 15 and 50. We want to talk to you this morning concerning the resurrection. As is the Easter according to custom re the resurrection. We want to say death has been defeated. Thank the Lord this morning for Marcus and Sierra Davies. Amen. Glad to have y'all this morning. Amen. 50. It says, and I'll read the first, you read the next, and we read the latter verse together. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither does corruption inherit incorruption. 51, you shall not see, but we shall all be changed. In the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the L's trump, for the trump shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be bought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. 55 Oh death, where I s for the stain of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to God which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unreovable, always abound in the work of the Lord. For as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. God bless you. You may be seated. Amen. Amen. God is good. Amen. Amen. Now this morning I said death has been defeated. Amen. Amen. In the resurrection morning the song says when the prison bars will be broken. Amen. And we know that death is a prison. Yes. Amen. Amen. And death in hell was styled as a prison. And uh souls were in prison by death. And because souls were in prison by death, Amen. they couldn't get out. But of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, Amen. death was defeated. Amen. Amen. So we want to go to Romans 6th chapter here. Romans 6 and4 just set a stage. Romans 6 and4 it says uh concerning uh it it starts off in the in the sixth uh chapter said what shall we say then shall we continue and sin that grace may abound? God forbid. Amen. Now we know death came by sin. The Bible said in the uh 6 and 23 the wages of sin is death. Amen. So when we associate death and sin, they come together. Amen. Because the day you eat of the tree, the day you eat or day you touch it, you're going to die. Praise God. Amen. And we understand that man died spiritually the day he ate. Because Methuselah lived 969 years and he died. The Bible said one day is with the Lord is as a thousand years. Amen. So the day he ate, the day he died. Amen. Spiritually, death fed in. The day you don't eat of the tree of life, you die. Are you with me? Amen. You have a an invitation to eat of the tree of life. And the day you don't eat it, you die. Are you with me? Amen. God has made it possible that you don't have to die. Amen. Amen. So in the sixth verse he says wait Caleb therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in what? Newness of life. Newness of life. You know I I wouldn't sat around and be dead just because I want to be dead. Death, Amen, has it sting to it. Amen. Death has its corruptible ways to it. That's right. But he said, I I want you to I behold I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep. Amen. Amen. But we shall be changed. Yes, I believe that not only as it talks about an event called the resurrection, it also talks about a person who is the resurrection. Amen. For Jesus said, I am Amen. the resurrection. Amen. I am the life. Amen. So, we're looking for Jesus to come back and a and take his uh church or his bride away. Amen. But there is a a a a resurrection and a change being made now. Amen. Amen. In order to go then, you must be changed now. Bless. Amen. You must put off the old man and put on the new man. Amen. Amen. You must put off the corruptible to put on the incorruptible. Amen. You must be born again. Not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible seed. By the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. Amen. The resurrection. What does it mean to you and I? It means that death has been defeated. Amen. And if death has been defeated, then sin has been defeated. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Aren't you glad that sin is defeated? Amen. Sin. God said no. Uh, Amen. The soul that said it, it shall die. Amen. Praise God. But sin has been defeated. Amen. And I'm so glad my sins are forgiven. Said, "The last enemy in 1 Corinthians 15 and 26, it was talking about the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." Amen. Death is your enemy. Amen. Praise God. Sin have had you had you in prison. Praise God. Your enemy had you in prison. Sin. Amen. Sin is your enemy. You got to look at that devil is. And you got to recognize that's your enemy. That's the one that's killing you. Amen. That's the one that's destroying you. Amen. He's an enemy. Amen. Praise God. The soul flesh, this whole body came forth, amen, by uh disobedient. Amen. So, we were born in sin, shaken in iniquity. And it's sin that our mother conceived us. Are you with me? That's why Jesus told Nicodemus, Amen. He said, "How can a man be born when he's in when he's old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, you must be born again." Oh, yes. God has a way that you don't have to go back in your mother's womb, but you must be born again. A wider inner spirit. God got a way. Amen. To give you new life. Amen. Amen. Jesus said, "The thief come to kill, to steal, and destroy." But he said, "I come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly." Amen. I want to want you to have abundance of life. Amen. Amen. I don't want you to die. Amen. Without Christ. Amen. Amen. Why don't you accept eternal life? Amen. Amen. Praise God. You have an opportunity to have eternal life. Amen. But we turn it down because Amen. We call sin our friend. Come on, somebody. Amen. Uh look at somebody tell sin is not your friend. Praise God. But people uh Amen. Uh Amen. look like they fall in love with the wrong one. Amen. Amen. You fall in love with sin. Praise God. Don't fall in love with sin, but falling in love with Jesus. Is the what? Best thing I what I've ever done. Amen. Falling in love with Jesus. Amen. Is the best thing I ever done. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Somebody say you got to love yourself. You got to hate this flesh. If you don't love yourself, who going to love you? Amen. Praise God. You got to hate this ugly thing. Well, come on. Ain't nothing good in me. Amen. Nothing good. Praise God. You got to hate the flesh. Amen. Praise God. Cuz this is the thing that held me in bondage. Amen. Praise God. This is the thing that blinds you. This is the thing that keep you from serving God. The flesh. Amen. Flesh and blood, he says, shall not what? Inherit. Inherit the kingdom of God. Neither does corruption inherit incorruption. Amen. Got to be something done with it. Amen. Praise God. I'm talking about the resurrection. Amen. God. Amen. This thing can't go. Amen. So, I want to go to heaven, but the flesh and blood can't go there. Amen. Let me just move on. It says in and I'm going to read the fifth verse again. For we been planted together in the likeness of his death, we are we shall also we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. I when we are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we go down in the liquid grave and we are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the one who died for us. Amen. Not the Trinitarian baptism of Father, Son, Holy Ghost, but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Are you with me? Amen. God is good. Amen. Amen. The Bible said in Adam, not Travis, but in Adam, All die. But in Christ, all shall make be made alive. The last Adam. Amen. Amen. All shall be made alive. God is good. Amen. Amen. So we all was children of the flesh, earthly. The first man, Adam, was earthly of the earth. The last man Adam was of quick of spirit. Amen. One came. Amen. Amen. And and he was born. Amen. He was given life. The other come to give life. Amen. Jesus. Amen. Come to give you life. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. Amen. So by the grace of God, the earthly man can give you life. That's right. Amen. But Jesus, the spirit man, he can give you life. Amen. Because he is the origin of light. Amen. In him was life and the life was the light of men. Amen. The light shined in darkness and the darkness comprehended and not. Amen. I'm telling you, the darkness can't comprehend this light. Amen. Praise God. But thank be to God that God has made a way through Jesus Christ that the light of God should shine in our hearts. Thank God for Jesus. Thank God for the Holy Ghost. Thank God for the power of God. We got something. Amen. Thank God I've been planted. Not just in water, but in spirit baptism. Amen. Because sometimes we put too much emphasis on water. Amen. But it's got to be a spiritual baptism. Amen. It is not because we shouted, not because we got happy, not because we cried, not because we spoke in tongues. It's because God came and changed our lives. Amen. There's been a change in and there's no change. It doesn't matter how emotional you are. It doesn't matter what you say you done. Amen.
