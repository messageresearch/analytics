as we look to to you for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen want to look at the Book of Joshua by the grace of God Joshua 24 very familiar scripture amen try not to be before you long Joshua 24 and we'll begin for the sake of time we can begin here at the let's begin at the at the 12th verse you got it sayen and it reads and when the children of Israel heard of it though wrong wrong scripture sorry about that let's start start at the what I say the 12th start at the 12th verse and I and I sent the horn before you which drave them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with the sword nor with thy bow and I have given you a land for which you did not labor and cities which you built not and ye dwell in them of The Vineyards and Olive yards which which you planted not do you eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whom whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord and the people answered and said said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods for the Lord Our God he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great things in our sight and preserved Us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed may God a bless the reading of his word you may be seated tonight just for a moment amen I want to I want to to speak to you just for a moment on choices Amen on choices you know just kind of lay a background here this is Joshua here you know speaking to the people and you know you can go home later I skipped over a lot of the salutation he was giv to people for the time sake but you know he was just they come to a place I guess and and and where you know God brought them out by Mighty Deliverance he did great things in their lives and they were going over he was going over some of the things and and the Deliverance that God had brought uh in their lives so and they could acknowledge that yes God has been good to us but even in all of what God had done for him God still wasn't going to force uh them to choose to to to love him or to choose him he still was going to give him a choice and all that God and all the good goodness and the things that God did he still was going to give them a choice to whether they want to serve him or not but before the choice was given out to them the the the Proclamation was given to them he just reminded them like we said of all the goodness that he's done and he says now if you still want to go after those other gods go ahead after them but it was Joshua you know giving out a salutation but one of the things he says you know in the short term saying it that you know y'all can do whatever y'all want to do but as for me and my house we going to serve the Lord because you know it it's it's more than just his goodness that we look at sometimes you know sometimes we we serve God only like they say in the good times but I I've been looking it's more than just God's goodness but you know we know that by love and kindness he's draw he's draws us but to me it's more it's I I thank him for the goodness but it's it's more to some some what about the grace of God I always have that little saying that if God don't do nothing else he already did enough and that's and that's true because just Just For What where he's brought us from just for saving our souls and filling us with the precious Holy Ghost for him doing those things that's already enough to carry us out throughout eternity so in this life when you when you sold when you come you find yourself sold out to God then it's nothing else that the devil no trial no test no none of those things will be able to shake you away from the Salvation your salvation you know I was ministering last week on on patience by trials because the Bible says that tribulation work is patience patient experience experience hope hope make it not as shame right and those things it says that there there's no uh temptation all those things that that's come under you that you know the Saints of old ain't already been tried tried by but these things things are coming to try you that that uh uh you might gain patience out of it because patience is going to perfect you but we talking about the choices I'm talking about choices tonight you know I said every man's got a choice you got a choice you got a choice here tonight amen a choice of what you want to do with yourself let's say it like that choice what you want to do with your life you know where you find yourself th that's been living a little while where you find yourself at today are results of a choice that you made earlier in life come on I always tell people 10 years now where you'll be 10 years now is going to be the results of a decision that you made or choices that you made a lot of times we want to blame God sometimes for our life being in chaos or our life being in shipwreck or our life being in uh uh bad places we were saying the other night you know some people were saying that one time but I says you know you can't put that on God because where you find yourself where you found yourself was a choice that you made God was merciful that you still have breath you still have life you still got chance to you know make it right and to serve him but don't blame I said don't blame God for being where you are because of a choice that you made because God put freely before every man life and death and that's what it was you know and uh even though God created us and somebody some people say you know you know as the Bible talks about predestination and all those things God can't predestinate you he could write your name there because he already know he still gave you the ability to choose but he already know what choice you would make he already know what decision you make so before the foundation of the world he could write your name there it wouldn't be by coincidence that you and I would be here tonight and and have it in our hearts to serve the Lord or just come together from different walks of life different areas but have one in the same desire that no matter what hole I came out of or no matter what uh uh family or or Trend that I came out of our desires is all the same because God put it there and that is to do what to serve God I don't know about you but you know we have a lot of goals and Ambitions in life a lot of things that we want to do and Achieve but it's one thing that that could never uh uh I could never get away from since the Lord come into your life is that that the main goal is to make Heaven the main goal out of all the things that I'm trying to do and achieve my main goal is to do whatever the will of God is and sometimes the the will of God ain't ain't ain't necessarily what's going to be good and what we feel or what we want you know even Jesus when he was in yesin he was crying out he said Lord if it be possible let this cup pass but not that my will but let thy will be done come on because he knew what what what his destination was he knew what the road was before him right and even though he might have within himself know it was a hard rooll and and and and wanted to cut to pass but nevertheless he knew that that it meant more to to be in what to do whatever the will of God was more than what he desired and I feel that way tonight I hope you feel that way tonight God you know I said I asked a question do you want what God's will is for your life come on I want what God's will is for my life but in all us like we says what God does he uh he he gives us uh uh choices right he gives you the the ability to choose he's not God is one thing about God the devil might try to force you to do things but God Don't Force you he's not brute like that God is he makes you a free moral agian right people come to God and that's why you know when when when Jesus came the Bible says there was no beauty that we should desire him right you you came to God people didn't come to God because of his Beauty they didn't come to Jesus because of of who he was how much money he had and all those things but he made it the way that the only people that would come to him is the people that wanted to come to him or the people that were in such a need that against all of what the standard standards was of what they thought God was supposed to look like or was supposed to be they had to Lo lose all of that because they were in a need Hallelujah and I don't know sometimes that's why God you know God we look at situations on our lives but God gets us to that place to where we can see how much we need him come on and even in those low times don't you know sometimes people still don't know how much they need him am you know I was I share I share with one of my brothers all the time maybe listening in theight but I share with him I says everybody Rock Bottom ain't the same but you know it when you get there come on everybody's on ain't the same sometime God got to take people through all this and all that sometime God just got to take people through a little right but nevertheless the goal is the same God loves you tonight how much do God got what does God got to do to show you how much he love you I asked that question what does how much does God got to do to show us that he cares about us what what else does he have to do come on hasn't he gone through enough hasn't he done enough that we can say Lord I thank you God you don't got to you don't got I ain't going to take God through nothing else I'm going to lift him up because I know he already been through enough come on you know sometimes a as a as a as a children we was saying that sometimes a parent can do all that they that they uh can possibly do for a child right sometime the child don't see the parent working going in the work sick going in the work in pain going through the Mind child can't see what the parent doing just so they can have clothes on their back just so they can have lights and water food they only see the the parents sometime and up but they don't see those midnight hours they don't see the The Taking of sometimes what they got to put up with on the job do they but they might get to a place in their life and say Mom and Daddy ain't never did nothing for me right but if they can only see the the the agony the pain the the things that that parent had to go through come on but that's how we treat God sometime ain't it come on it ain't that we might say that but our attitude towards him if we only knew what God the the the depths that he went through come on we give him praise like we didn't have our right mind we'd come in the house of God if we only knew the depths of what it cost for you to be here tonight come on we don't understand the depths we don't understand how he was sitting on the throne worshiped of angels come on streets of gold pearls and all those things the Angels crying out holy we don't understand the depths of all that he gave up Hallelujah to come to a people that reject him to come save a people that's ashamed of him a people a world that don't want him we don't understand the depth sometimes but when we think about it we learn to praise God right then when we think about it we learn to say Lord thank you thank you for what you done for me I ain't worried about what I got right now thank you for what you did thank you for life health and strength strength if you didn't take those weapons we wouldn't have healing tonight you know he hadn't to take that all that suffering was for our healing you know that all that Whip and the beats and the and all that Agony was for our healing come on all that Dragon AC cross going up galath was because he desired for you and I to be saved he knew that we and ourselves were rotten wretched come on undone don't think about how good you are what you didn't do you will come into the world speaking lies ready to be condemned from the womb that's how we came in the world but Jesus came one day Hallelujah the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world that we don't have to cover for our own sins but the blood hallelujah oh Jesus the blood of speak for us I'm so glad I couldn't speak for myself and I had to realize that one day but I needed that blood that without that shedding of blood Hallelujah but God came I'm so glad he came along one day aren't you glad tonight come on but still yet like we says what it is God gives you a choice don't he come on that's what Joshua is laying out before here it's many that made the wrong choice you know that many that made choices that they couldn't recover from but God God allow gives us the ability to choose come on that's what it is think about it every time you know you got choices to make you had choice to make whether you was going to come to church tonight right God didn't force you to come here you had a choice didn't you I'm glad you chose right God is glad you chose but what are you going to do when you get here hallelujah come on oh what time he going to go too long tonight no I'm glad God I'm glad to be in that number one more time come on I could have been dead laid up in the grave somewhere in the hospital come on somebody was telling me about a condition today I could have been in that condition come on not with life health and strength but God hallelujah who was rich in Mercy came by Hallelujah and he desired to smile on me I'm so glad that God Smiled On Me come on at an early age and even right now God is still smiling on you but yet like we say you have a choice God ain't going to force you right come on but you know many times though God gives us choices and though we know how good God Is Right a lot of times people still make the wrong choice why sometimes why sometimes you ask the question why come on we got so many examples sometimes of people that walk down certain roads and you know where that road end up at right it could be told the stories can be told over and over and over but yet people still make the choice to go down the wrong road don't they come on thinking that you might get different results Hallelujah but I know that there is a road called a straight and the narrow way and I know what the results of that road is It's A Hard Road yes it is because it's so narrow you got to walk down it by yourself it's so narrow you you can't even take your wife with you so narrow you can't take your friend with you so narrow you can't take Mom and Daddy with you you got to walk by yourself Hallelujah but at the end of that road is life Hallelujah you say you walking by yourself but God is there with you the whole time I like that little song they sang It's been a long long journey but Jesus been right here by my side the whole time come on but I said you got a choice come on and that's what uh uh laying out we can I has so many got so many examples we can use tonight throughout all the scriptures of choices come on you think about in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve had a choice didn't they come on God put them there made the garden Beautiful Everything God made was good wasn't it and they had a choice he put before them life and death didn't he and you could choose what you want life or death come on somebody said I would have never chose death what made them choose death over life come on now we can go into the plan of God and all those things yes we can go in all that but in all in in the end of all of it they made a choice didn't they what made them choose death over life hallelujah what made them choose pain over Joy what made him choose Trouble Over peace what made him choose Hal Hallelujah you know the Bible says that when Eve saw the tree and she saw it was good for food come on her eyes deceived or didn't it come on that she was willing for what she saw what she heard or what the devil told her come on made it sound so good that it sound better than what God had Hallelujah sometimes it looks so appealing you you think about our young folks a lot of times the world look so appeasing so appealing look Smart in what God has for you but look at the end look down the road look at the end of the story come on Hallelujah God wants to give you life might seem like a bing Road might seem like a boring life but I tell you what God came in my life at an early age and I never regretted it hallelujah it's been joy unspeakable and full of Glory some of the pain I a have to go through Hallelujah why because God already he already he took me out of that Hallelujah and I'm glad he did I don't regret it not one day Hallelujah but you said why did they choose why would they choose uhh death you know she saw it she it was something that you know desires come on to make one wise Hallelujah but in all the end you know choosing death come on because the day they eat the day you eat of it the day you was going to die they died come on but I I begin to you know just meditate on it and every time pain struck Hallelujah that pain was a result of the choice that you she made right every time sickness came that was the result Hallelujah of the choice you made every time hard time the the the animals turn against you the ground turn against you sorrow sickness all that was a result of a of the choice Hallelujah that they made they gave up life gave up eternal life gave up all of that Hallelujah because of the choice they made right God in his solving Grace though had a way to get us back Hallelujah to get us back from the chaos to get us back but he says I ain't going to force you back make a choice Hallelujah I said what choice will you make tonight but the problem I say what it is you know all of that and we can go through all the scriptures throughout the scriptures but I say all of these things was was the results and the choice they made they just chose to disobey God come on the choice was to disobey him I said what what it is we find that we we make choices in life but we don't want to deal with the after effects of the choices that we made it's hard to deal with the after effects of your choice come on right now it might seem pleasurous I'm going to deal with it I'm going to do it now because it's pleasur I'll deal with it later but when the later comes it's hard to deal with it hard to deal with the choices that we made come on so many I got tell you a couple testimonies but but friends that made choices that took away their life took away took away all things from them because of choice I deal with it I know the consequence but you didn't know how severe the consequences was going to be you didn't know how severe it was going to be of that choice you made Hallelujah but right now come on God is giving us Grace I want to say tonight make the right choice as Joshua told those look at how good God been to you come on just think back way God he said I'mma give you land and all those Vineyards that you ain't bu cities you ain't build Vineyards you ain't plant you eating of it God has been good to you but still yet you got a choice you got to make make the right choice Hallelujah and you know many of them made the wrong choice still yet what it is wanting the king wanting all these things throughout all the scriptures right because of of what everybody else was doing but I say that that come on sometimes you can make you can make decisions that that you that you won't recover from you know I I was saying like this I said like this the timing of your decision might be bad come on some people make decisions and God give them space to recover from it or they can recover from it but the timing right now the timing is bad you say why the time right now every choice you make is going to count I believe that you say why you know we at to break right now World War II the world don't believe that come on well the world believes it the church don't believe let's say it like that the ones who supposed to believe it don't but the rest of the world know it and they shaking come on I said what choices are you make right now what the devil I'm me tell you what the enemy does the enemy he he gets your mind he knows that it's the Midnight Hour come on he knows that the the bridegroom cometh he know that so what he'll do is try to get you entangled with everything else but making sure you got enough all he'll keep you he got all kinds of things to keep you busy you won't be on your knees keep you busy you can't cry out for God come on keep you tied up with tomorrow Hallelujah but God might come in the morning tonight anytime things could change I said where will your soul be brother wherever your soul be sister hallelujah it's time that we realize Hallelujah that whatever else God let my soul be right whatever else let me be ready for the coming of the Lord come on when you call I want to go out to meet him I got enough oil hallelujah oh Jesus but what the devil does he does that he keep us he keeps us uh uh uh intertwined tied you know just like even at work keep you TI busy TI busy work work work got all this stuff PL all this stuff everything we need you here we need you here we need you here y but what it is I said God no matter what I I can't give nothing more than nothing more of my time than you I can't give I can't give out nothing more than you God because in the end that's all that's going to matter we say it and we'll keep saying it when the lights are being turned off when your eyes are getting dim and closed and leaving this world ain't nothing

spirit Lord I said God but I know one thing you never lost one I said you didn't bring me this far to lose me that same fire that was lit that's been over 20 years ago now I said God I still it's still burning that desire that was met that was made that that came I still have that same desire and that is to be pleasing in your sight come on and I won't let nothing change that how many feel that way tonight come on but you got choices to make make the right choice the Young Rich ruler he had a choice didn't he but he didn't make the right choice Moses had a choice didn't he but he made the right choice so many out of the scriptures when it was laid before him they had a choice to make God ain't forc no not one person he won't Force you but he he he says whosoever will let him come you know I was meditating the other day on on that I said that he ain't willing that any should perish not you know God somebody say God he want them no he's not willing that any should perish but that all should come to what repentance and that's hard for us yes yes he said he set before us life and death you choose amen yet he says no man can come to Jesus except the father drawing so by the grace of God I thank God that the the choice that we made we had an unction from the Holy One if was somebody amen nudging us helping us oh so it was that voice that it we heard God called us and then we made the right choice because we knew that it was God that was calling us amen and as you see God calling you brother and sister don't waste this precious time this precious life that God has given
