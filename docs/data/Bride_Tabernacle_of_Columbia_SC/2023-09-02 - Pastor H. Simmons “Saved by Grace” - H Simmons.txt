we thank you for all things in Jesus name we pray amen like to welcome everyone Again Church we're glad to have everybody amen thanks from Tennessee glad to have you all and today to have our visit and friends um destiny grandmom and mother and we're glad for everybody amen um The Book of Romans 5 and 6 Romans 5 and 6. you know the question is we all we all should all always said Jesus saves but the question is do you want to be saved Jesus saved and we always say here most people can quote John 3 16 God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life but the question is do you want everlasting life so here we are uh Romans 5 and 6. from when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the what ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet prevention for a good man someone even dare dot to die but God committed his love to us towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for who much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies excuse me we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the what death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by what not ours but his amen you can't live good well enough or good enough to save your yourself it's his life God bless you you may be seated I don't I don't want to get too deep in here I just want to be simple tonight the Ephesians 2 Ephesians 2. saved by grace tonight Say by grace it's the Bible tells us it's not a works at least any manship boasts it is the gift of God you know I sometimes it's debatable some people believe that if I do this I'll be saved the Jehovah Witness teach if you knock doors and you know you give out the pamphlets and you have little studies and people home that you're saved the Mormons they go on their missionary journey and they got to go from house to house and do their thing everybody feel like they got to do something to be saved Jehovah Witness is only 144 000 the street slave class can go to heaven and the rest of the people you know if you work you can inherit the earth if you work hard enough and you be faithful so they teach that so everybody got their terminology true whereby if you abide by this or you abide by that you can be saved and that's every church every denomination they got away that they teach and they're Doctrine and they were preaching that you can be saved but we don't need to be confused as only one savior are you up man the Bible said we're saved not by what we do by his life not by what we know it's about his life see because a lot of times people because they know a lot and they know something you don't know didn't they tell you you're not saying or you cannot be saved a lot of people if you don't keep the Sabbath then you receive the mark of the beast so a lot of lots of time people tell you what you don't do and if you don't do this and if you don't believe that then you can't be saved the Bible says in Mark 16 16 he that believes in there to baptize shall be saved he didn't believe in not shall be damned okay Jesus said now I'm the way the truth and the light no man can come to the father but by me but we have many that think that they can put you in or put you out of heaven and if you do what they preach or they'll teach or their church or their denomination then you can be saved brothers and sisters we got to get away from thinking that Heaven only belonged to who we want in or who we want out if you do it this way and if you do it that way so a lot of times people's minds have been programmed so they're listening but they don't know that something has been injected in their spirit do you think they cause the Bible says that we can understand all Mysteries and have not charity Prophet that's what nothing so sometimes people think if I got this mystery of the seventh seed or the seven Thunder this I got oh I got it oh understand all Mysteries still you ain't saying are you a fan see a lot of times folk think because I got something nobody got and see sometimes preachers pull people into their Revelation their mystery and they hold the people in bondage because the people think that the preacher got something I gotta have I got friends of mine and they preach all over the world and they believe that you've got to believe that way I got the message I got it this way somebody else said I got another friend I got it this way I see it this way and you got to believe me this is it you got to believe me so we spread what we think that we got all over the world and I want to see how many people are going to believe like me so we create camps this one got a camp we might call it Perugia we might call it thunders we might call it whatever but yet we're saved by grace through faith are you with me so it's the grace of God that's going to save the preacher that knows it all the church they think they got it all it's the grace of God Gonna Save an individual it's not what we do and not what we have done uh have not done it's by Grace you'll see are you with me so people got a problem with that because everybody seem to be tooting their own horn and people are who I see it yes you might see exactly what they want you to see but you don't know that you don't see Jesus are you up there the one that you ought to be seeing he said if I be lifted up Adra it's Jesus Christ if he's being lifted up then he's going to draw all men notice it's not the church going to teach you all things it's not the preacher going to teach you all things but Jesus said the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father was sent in my name he shall teach you what that's why John said you have not that any man should teach you what the anointing to unction you have an unction from the Holy One and uh and that Holy Ghost is going to be your teacher he's going to lead you and guide you into all truth if it's not the Holy Ghost some people think the Holy Ghost will lead you into hey y'all ain't got it see as I said to the church yesterday I kept getting out and every morning I opened my Bible it comes to the place where Jesus disciples were saying to Jesus Jesus we saw one casting out devils in your name and we forbid him we stopped him because he wasn't with us and Jesus said if somebody casting out devils in my name can highly speak evil of me and he that is not against us is what isn't that right now you understand he that is not against us as well for us but sometimes we find ourselves against everybody that not of our persuasion Prophet God taught that it wasn't the people that he was it's the Antichrist system the denominational system decrees the dog was and to the word taken away from the word are you with me but it's not the people that I'm against I'm against the spirit of the Antichrist that's against the word are you with me but sometimes folks take an attitude and they look like they against people because they make themselves thank God then I'm not like that sinner there I fast I pay my tithes but I thank God that I'm not like that sinner see we think ourselves to be a lot of Pharisee except your right to succeed that are described and Pharisee you and know why it's going to end are you with me say by grace are you with me it's not that you deserve it it's God's favor it's the goodness of God that leads a man to repentance it's because he loves you and because his Mercy endureth forever God loves you enough to lay down his life far not his friends his enemies are you with me you didn't love God I didn't love God but God laid down his life even when we were enemies we didn't want to serve him we didn't want to live right we didn't want to do right because our nature was wrong we're by okay let's just look at it Ephesians 2 1. and you as he quickened Made Alive who were dead and trespass and sin the day Adam and Eve the day they ate of the tree that's the day they died spiritually they died naturally no man was able to live a thousand years because a thousand years in the Lord as just one day are you with me but through the live 969 years but he what he died are you with me so no man but has lived the day in God's eyes are you with me and spiritually his in his inner man died and needed to be redeemed his conscience amen he became conscious of his sin because he recognized that he was naked so what now people now today they don't recognize the nakedness are you a man but they they recognized he said I heard your voice walking into God and I hear myself why because I was naked amen before sin came in there was no conscience you could walk it was no sustaining at the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life you didn't have no problem with your eyes because it meant everything was pure but people trying to be pure now I said I ain't got no problem with that I ain't got no problem with this ain't got no problem with that you know what people ain't got no problem with sin no more people don't have their conscious of being hard their Consciousness has been like a hot iron they said people are becoming reprobate they don't want God they turn them down they say I don't need him so in their hearts it's hard hard people are doing all kind of hideous stuff and they're not saying I'm afraid of God and I'm reverence God I have a fear of God I have a love for God and I don't love him they don't mind telling you that so they can do anything they can kill they can rape they can murder them they can do anything and and they can smile and laugh about it why they're hard to become hard the Bible said the love of men are going to watch gold so they cold-hearted are you with me so we're living in a world that is gone totally insane whoa oh God I don't mean to be long tonight but the grace of God we blame by Nature were the children around it says here I go back over the second verse when in time past we walk according to the course of this world according to the what the what don't y'all know the devil amen the Devil comes to church I wouldn't say he said on the front road yeah if I can't say sit on the back road you know the devil come to church he he on time too are you with me the devil ain't laid praise God why because the devil want to see how what kind of spirits he can inject in you to make you come against God somebody said I'm not going to say Amen that was you didn't get that I'm not going to say Amen to the word of God it came from a spirit that had anoints you that you cannot say Amen because I disagreed with the word but when you agree with the word you ought to be able to say Amen are you up man but when you got a pause it's because either we don't understand oh the devil got your tongue oh you have been and of the I read a book sometime Hung by the Tongue are you with me and sometimes the devil I have your tongue it won't let you praise God why because it makes you feel guilty are you a man if you praise God then you're a hypocrite because you're not living right but when you live right you can say praise the Lord you can say thank you Jesus you can say Lord I want all your God from me give me all you got I want your spirit I want you Lord it ought to be all right but when you got trouble with God you know what I'm saying you you got uncertainty with God you know you you can't praise him well I don't know but when you're certain that God is God and he's real to you and you know he's the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God isn't that right and you know the word of God this is God this is God in letter form but the Holy Ghost is God in spirit form are you with me same God Amen wrote the Bible it's the same God that can live in us with his spirit okay it says The Prince and the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in what you wonder why we look at it he said among whom also we what among whom also we what we we you missed something very important that person over there that person over there that one that one not he said we what preaching the pulpit included isn't that right we all nobody was excluded we all are you with me so when you look at it somebody said well I'm so special to God that I'm Justified as though I've never done it yeah you've done it you've done it oh I'm Justified that God said that God has never done it in the first place you've done it sometimes we got to get a little bit simple yeah you've done it and you got to be it got to become convicted and convinced that you need salvation I need Jesus I need to be forgiven I need to accept the blood of Jesus and what he's done for me don't let me jump across that jumped on up in The Mystery World let me come to the reality that I need Jesus amen I'm in bad shape I needed help I need the law and I need God amen but we jump to justification and I've never done anything man you need to change that Old Vile nature That Old Vile way of living and that old corrupt way of living you need God you need you need to have peace with God you don't have peace with your own self you need peace with God are you with me but here we look and jump all the way up and people flying come on let's come down to earth let's get God first and then let's go on to perfection but let's get these principles out the way are you with me let's don't fly amen praise God you might be an eagle but you gotta get a little strong you got to get it fast and praise God and then your wings Start and your Sprint start coming isn't that right then you can fly some folks praise God can't walk and trying to fly are you with me or less okay we all had our conversation and what in time passed into what you know lust of our flesh that's what we were we were dealing with this outside man this corrupt man born in sin shaper than the nicotine we have to deal with the spirit we had to deal with this man that ain't no good amen in me that is in my flesh dwelling what no good thing it's nothing good about me praise God so I had to deal with that amen praise God this is not amen the way God wants me to be amen I'm not Southern with the amen my old nature my old self amen this flesh and I got a walk going on I'm gonna fight amen praise God every time this old flesh and this little uh thing come rising up you got to fight amen once you don't fight the the old nature or take back over praise God well when you get the Holy Ghost God give you power amen not to do those things are you up man that is that's his grace on your life amen God's love is shattered abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost God's God love us we can be ruled you know sometimes we're in a hurry when somebody do us wrong wait a minute you can't do me like that I'm gonna let you know you can't do me like that but when you get the Holy Ghost back up now back up you're walking in your flesh who do you think you are Mr Big Stuff are you with me you better calm yourself down we all get in ourselves sometime don't we and thank me something when we're nothing are you a man and God wants you to recognize not so flesh amen it it wants you to walk in the flesh but you don't need to walk in the flesh you need to walk in the spirit isn't that right how did Jesus conduct his life how did he walk if he's walking in you he's living in you then you ought to react and respond like he would when they were persecuting him and when they were doing him wrong how did he respond did he try amen wait a minute Peter got a sword he's gonna cut the man here off isn't that right and ready to cut his head off probably he just missed his head and God is in here are you with me and Jesus just took and put the man ear back on isn't that right and he said Peter put up your sword they don't live by this world going to die by this world isn't that right so oh and some of us ain't put up our swords yet amen you let him come my way look look I'll show you you know I won't take not with nobody I'm big I'm bad I'm dumb you know I'm packing it I'm packing it I'm right I got I'm packing you know you got all kinds of terminology when we Bang you'll be packing in somebody come here they're losing yourself just showing you where you are don't walk in your flesh they may depend on his angels the angels of the Lord and Camp about them to put their trust in him are you with me let the angels of God let God fight your battles Amen Let God be God Amen don't you fight for yourself let God be God Amen but we'll we think we got to defend and fight our own battles but God is gone we're serving a god okay so by the grace of God let's just go on and um the lust of our flesh fulfilling desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God what see that's what it is rich in Mercy for his great love with he won he loved us amen even when we were dead in what has he made alive quickened us together with Christ by what by what do you deserve it we don't deserve it by grace USA saved by grace aren't you glad aren't you glad that he did it for you do you appreciate him doing it I mean eternal life is yours but you got to believe that it's a better life the life that we live now if this was it whether it be worth living stuff we have to go through things we have to put up with sometimes we you know this all life has to offer but Jesus Christ got a better way are you with me except a man be born again he cannot work see the kingdom of God God wants to show you his glory his Beauty his favor he wants to show you his purpose why he died because he cared amen sometimes we live in our own little world saying nobody care about me but Jesus Christ already proved how much you care sometimes we feel like nobody really really genuinely lovers but he already proved how much he loved us are you with me and you don't have to do any more he's already done enough if his grace and mercy went on our lives you know we couldn't even get out the bed this morning and somebody wasn't able to get up I said Lord's will not got a funeral to preach tomorrow young ladies Reverend Wolf's
