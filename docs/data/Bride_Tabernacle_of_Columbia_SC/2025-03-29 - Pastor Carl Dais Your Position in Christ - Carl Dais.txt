we come to lift you up tonight yes Lord J help us lord lord for we love you now in Jesus nameus amen amen as we stand tonight the book of second Corinthians third chapter toss between two sermons pray that the Lord's will 2 Corinthians 3r chapter begin reading at the second verse if you have it say Amen 2 Corinthians 3r chapter 2 verse ye are ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stones but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves as to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of Goden who have also have made us able Ministers of the New Testament not with the letter but with the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated tonight by God's grace a few minutes minister to you on your position in Christ amen amen your position in Christ amen now as Paul was speaking here and he said if ye are Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men so your position in Christ tonight and I want to look at a subtopic a hidden life with Christ amen a hidden life with Christ see we not just church goers amen but I'm talking about a hidden life with Christ now a hidden life in Christ so now you must know your position in Christ amen as he said you are written and read of all men amen so the life that you are living now on the job in the schoolhouse wherever you may be someone is reading your life amen sister Tate someone is reading your life am and they're seeing your actions and how you respond and how you act to a situation or condition and you say you're a Christian amen amen amen you say you love Jesus amen you say you are part of Christ amen but sometimes our actions are not Christlike amen sometimes our actions are the farthest away from Christ amen is it because of what we looking at as making us act the way we act or what see what you are feeding on tonight is part of the position that you in amen but we're preaching tonight your position in Christ amen or your hidden life with Christ oh we just going come to church and just sing a nice song and go out and not be a Christian are we going to live what we singing am are we going to preach what we're preaching we we're going to live what we preaching amen are we going to do what we want to do act like we want to act and don't know that you're Christian don't know that you've been deceived by the world Amen Colossians 3 sometimes when we praying we have to look back and ask God what is really going on with me because sometimes we don't even don't even understand the spirit that is on us and why we act like we act amen and sometimes our fellow sisters and brothers or parents can't even discern and tell us the way we act because they're afraid or whatever the situation may be they afraid to tell someone what is going on with them because you want them not to tear them down but you want them to grow in Christ growth I found out in Camp then you got to go down I found out en Camp when you growing you're going down people hate you people dislike you but when you going down see Jesus said I must go down that I might go up amen amen see in the garden he went down and when he was resurrect they set him God set him on the right hand of the Throne of God in the heavens so sometimes when we go down it means we going up amen so when someone comes to bring correction to you in love take the correction with love am Colossians 3 and one he says forgot my glasses tonight amen if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are where above above are we seeking those things which are above where Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affections on things of above and not on things of the earth and on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God so when you in your position your position it puts you into a place of death no matter how somebody treat you I was ministering on last night and this I'm almost about the middle of the sermon now but when you're in your position it means you are able to take whatever someone brings to you that's right Jesus was in his position not even just The Garden of Gethsemane but all through the books J Mark Matthew Mark Luke and John but Jesus was in his position and he could handle whatever condition faced him amen thank you Jesus Jesus said one place he said before Abraham was I am they begin to call him a born in fornication and all that he never got angry because he knew his position amen and tonight if you know your position in Christ then you can handle any and every position thing that happens to you amen but now let's look at a Christian in their position you're professional it means you read your Bible every day it means you pray every day if God would hold us accountable according to the law is 2 hours and 40 minutes a day that you're supposed to be doing spiritual things see God by Sovereign Grace and Mercy said I'm going to put you in your position but it's going to be a little bit of suffering going along with it it's going to be a little bit of Trials going along with people going to ridicule you sometime they're going to talk about you and your children sometime but guess what you know you in your position so it's all right see you must see the spiritual application of your position to know that's part of your growth and it's going to continue to come until you recognize this is a test of the American broadcast system this is only a test and you must pass it it's going to come around over and over again glory to God you must pass it and I know tonight by God's grace uh God said the test is upon you young people old people middle a people God said your test that you're going through preacher it's going to continue to come and it's going to be more intensified until you pass it I said Lord in Wrath remember Mercy amen help me to get through the test that I can show forth the very grace and mercy of Jesus Christ that now I can be cemented in my position amen amen amen go ahead amen talking to a young man that did at the job Rob begin to tell him about hydraulic concrete we ordered some and supervisor on the job say order some concrete we got to fix some patches in the Basin that's full of water the hole is rounded out so he wanted me to explain to him hydraulic concrete epoxy how it works you can buy it in five gallons or three gallons or one gallon but when the concrete is to the point the anchor can't hold that's where the hydraulic concrete comes in some of them is only a minute set up time sometimes they get hard in the bucket before it sets up and it gets 400 degre but the concrete is that you put it in the hole and you got one minute 5 minutes or 10 minutes working time to push the anchor in and when that minute is up or 5 minutes up then you can apply pressure we in Satan Eden amen Leia the pressure is not going to stop it's going to intensify upon your life to prove what position you are at whether you are a true Christian or whether you just one of the ones that's on the side that love to go to the church uh you know sometime we got people love to go to the church uh some people love the pastor some people just love to be in the church uh they don't really want to be a Christian CHR it is in the church but with the ones that want to be a Christian thou the Christ the son of the Living God for flesh and blood has not revealed this to me but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it you got to come correct and right say God in Wrath remember Mercy amen amen God I need your mercy am I need your help no matter what I'm going through Lord it takes Jesus to take me through it and Lord if I'm in my position I must react accordingly according to the position that's in amen amen thank you Jesus yes Lord in whom also we are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ beared with him in what baptism we bear with him in baptism on Colossians 12 3 and 12 bear with him in baptism where on you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who have raised him from the dead amen so if you are buried with him in baptism you that old man has been buried amen the old man ain't supposed to be resurrected amen I'm going show him who I am yes you will show them who you are you're not in your position if you thinking it like that amen they don't know who they talking to see if you in your position then you don't have no identity anymore amen see your position don't have any identity but Christ amen they spit on him they whipped him he suffered 39 Stripes beat on his back spit on him everything you must take it cuz it cement your position buar it with him in baptism where also you risen with him through the faith of the operation of God see God is operating on our hearts amen that now we must love the unlovable amen we must work with the unworkable we must deal with the undal I mean some people they're going to take you to Beyond some people going to take you there amen and I don't like to pick at my daughter out of these Generations that's coming now behind the Baby Boomers and Generation X which as I am I said these Generations coming behind I just don't know what's what they capable of doing but if you're in Christ it don't make no difference what generation you are am you got to get in Christ they so smart and so crafty till they think they can figure out how to get out their situation and how to get out their trouble and outsmart their parents and don't know they devil possess God sees everything we doing amen and when you get a revelation he sees everything you doing then you'll do right amen amen you'll come to church not just because your parents tell you to come you'll come to church because you want to live for God and they'll see you somewhere in the corner in your house in your room reading your Bible and praying cuz you know that now the challenge that you have recognized the challenge that you're going through now it's going to take something see people come to church don't think that the devil is real amen amen amen the devil going to put you in your position he going to put you out one way or the other you could be in your position because of the devil or you could be out your position he going to make sure you are Christian or not you don't believe it just keep living amen just keep living keep living and dealing with people amen amen you going to know who you are and you going to know who they areen amen amen Beed with him in baptism also we risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who have raised fre him from the what and you being dead in and you being dead in your sins and the circum uncircumcision of your flesh hath he what quickened together with him having forgiven you of all your trespasses see when God forgive you of your trespasses you can forgive your brothers and sisters of their trespasses amen see that's what the position does the position once it forgives you then you got the heart of God to forgive others amen see if you can't successfully forgive somebody that SLA you sister Le if you can't forgive it brother Le they can slap you they step on your shoe and L and walk away that's right they going to do it you got to be able to forgive them because you love God Amen and now you have passed the test the trial the situation the condition that's coming upon you brother Fred we not we not we we we we still going to go through it too no matter how old you are you going to go through it amen it's coming amen because it's there to get you in your position and you ain't just in your position you been cemented there why by suffering amen amen Jesus was seeing in his position because of suffering amen he looked at it and he said father if it be possible let this cup pass amen he was without sin church amen we were born in sin he was without sin and still yet he had to submit to the flesh amen but he said father if it be possible let this cup pass but not my will amen it's his will and you must be a in his will amen amen amen amen not my will but his will be and the release relinquish yourself to him and let his will be done you're going to go through some stuff amen people going to treat you any kind of way but glory be to God I'm in my position no matter how much suffering I have to go through glory be to God let it come God cuz why I'll be walking in the streets of gold amen transparent glass the Bible says Jes he creates this go why because of the sufferings of his bride to walk on the streets of gold we ain't even no Cakewalk Church Jesus there's not no Cake Walk amen this is the real deal amen amen and once you see the sufferings Jesus that you have to go in the mind the body Lord and rejection from people you see the demons amen the Devils oh lurking already J it Scar the de you won't come to church play amen amen you come to church to serve God Amen you come to church to do his will amen you won't come because you're pretty amen or you got a nice dress J or a nice suit on you will come because you've been led by the spirit of God Amen and the Bible said they that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God I'm talking about power I'm talking about anointing I'm talking about something that when the devil see you coming he's angry amen amen so I know they don't want to do nothing amen I know they a about nothing they don't even read their Bible every day they don't even pray they pray with something going on am something happen that's all we Christians amen weak message Believers mhm weak amen won't even listen to a message Jesus listen that one a year read the Bible twice a year Jesus don't even pick their Bible until they come in church and they say they part of the church they part of the truth what truth it must be in you amen and the Bible said if it abounds it neither make you neither baren knowing fruitful in the knowledge of Jesus Christ amen so you would have the knowledge that grace of God the knowledge will open our entrance into the Everlasting Kingdom of the spirit am now look what he says blotting out the handwriting against us handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to what cross his cross so if you got a cross toight then something going to be nailed to your cross amen amen amen something going to be nailed to your your the Bible said Jesus learned obedience by the things he what suffer he amen so your children suffering and going through is needful it's a good thing and it's suffer you be right there with him just trust God Amen just keep studying God and keep reading God I told my daughter I

drink open it up see what you going to do you deal with the wor people now mhm I told my daughter what you going to do he speeding your drink then it might spit through the window in your face they supposed to do that yeah supposed to do because they getting you in your position they're getting you where you supposed to be yes what they doing is wrong but they've been anointed and ordained by God to get you where you supposed to amen amen s always say Amen bring some people in the church to help others get be a Christian I said Thank You Lord I got that Revelation now he said that 27 years ago I said that's a revelation some people in the church just to help you be a Christian that's right they keep you straight amen amen second Peter 3 they're here to make you right they're here to help you amen help you be a Christian amen and young people lead the church won listen at their parents they lead the church live any kind of way shack up do all kind of stuff we still praying for them amen amen we still calling on God for amen but guess what that season of obedience that they be in they going to have to pay for it but God going to bring them out amen amen you can't make them do nothing amen I wish I can keep him 12 years old for life keep 12 years old forever but they got to grow up amen and they got to make their own decisions amen as you make your own decision just be able to bear this trial and his suffering you going to go through for making your decisions is not listening amen the man that went out and said father give me all that's belong to me how he thought something belong to him how he thought something belonged to him he ain't wait for it so the father gave him his living that he was going to air to him he went out with righteous living live with prostitutes and all kind of stuff living all kind of ungodly and in club and all kind of stuff was brought up right amen and when he got to the end of his Road he F to eat the swine slop going to drink it he said I got a father that I can be a servant that's right he didn't want to be a son he want to be a servant amen my father make me a servant I done mess my life up I done went out and done all kind of stuff let him make me a servant but look what Jesus done see this type Christ amen look what he did he didn't made him no Ser to amen he didn't make him a servant amen he knew what position he's supposed to be in am and he put him in that position even though he was a sinner amen a liar and everything home adulterous ficat he said kill the Fat Cat amen give him the best suit dress Rob to put on Amen my son is was lost now he's found amen amen don't never talk about your children pray cuz God has to bring them back if your prayer is in the right position if you name position they might not come back but you getting position so your prayer will anchor amen amen that's the gospel Christ the power of God and even though the other son never went out in the world Amen Pro God showed that he might have been lost when he thought about his brother he was a Tex door m d did what the daddy said M but if he saw what was going on with his brother he would had a better response that's right but he had a carnal response to what his brother was doing true instead of being happy for him he would just come a denomination aage see the message is you Christ se you the hope of glory message message this that must be in you and that is the power of God it must come by Revelation to you di the Christ the son of the Living God for flesh and blood has not revealed this Matthew 167 but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen you must have a revelation of Jesus Christ in the baptism of the Holy Ghost are you lost [Applause] amen I don't care what you be cuz the spirit comes to Quicken the word the spirit gives life to the word you can read the Bible and it's just dead letter but the spirit has to come upon the word and bring life to your body your spirit your heart amen am the Holy Ghost got to come in that heart am and not a word it's a new book amen it's a new book now and nothing can stop you amen Before Peter said Lord he denied him three times but after he said crucify me upside down amen cuz I'm not worthy to be crucified like my Lord he had a revelation Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews came to Jesus by Night amen why he couldn't come doing the day cuz he was religious he said D do teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest amen except God be with him amen he said Marvel not means Ponder not on what I'm saying don't think deep on what I'm saying Marvel not I said unto thee ye must be born again the wind blows where listen I hear the sound there but can't tell when it comes when it go so is everyone that is born of the spirit if you're a Christian and you going in that position Brother G I see you praying in the Midnight Hour children brother Ernest will see you praying in the Midnight Hour amen amen amen and mine might not stay with no more but the holy spirit will tell me they praying in the Midnight Hour if you're born of the spirit and you seeking your position see Paul on the road to Damascus yes Paul say and I'm getting off my sermon now off my text on my thought I mean I still on my thought giving me scripture amen Paul on the road to Damascus he persecuted the church he wasted it he said Paul said in Galatians I wish stood and hold the clothes of them why was being whipped and thrown in jail and murdered he's for God in Gans who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood but Paul began to look and after Paul

that's in the world that will guide us to the things of God I thank God for the Lord using you all tonight and um let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer I did bring my guitar to sing a song tonight but um we'll probably see it the other some other time let's bow our hearts before the Lord Heavenly Father as our brother said our footsteps are ordered of the Lord if you didn't want us to be here we wouldn't be here but you've called us Almighty father even before the foundation of the world you knew we'd be sitting in the places where we are what we're thinking you knew everything that we were going to be thinking and you you knew what the brother was going to preach tonight Almighty father and that hidden life Almighty father you said greater is he that is in us than is he that's in the world and he as born of God overcometh the world so we consider ourselves Victorious tonight Lord because Jesus Christ lives within us you were above us you with us but now you're in US Almighty father and you said that he that what follows you will never walk in darkness and said we walk in the light as you are in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness from all sin we thank you for the bleeding bloody word that you've sent in this hour to cleanse us and to prepare us for your coming Lord and as we leave this place Lord we ask that the angel of your presence would go with each and every one of us bring us back at the appointed time ay father to our positions and help us to find our position in you and occupy until you come Lord we love you Lord and we just give you the praise and thanks for the victory that we have in you Lord bless every household that's represented here and bless every family and bless the pastor in his absence and we just commit all things into your Mighty hands now father in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord amen God bless you Saints [Music] J
