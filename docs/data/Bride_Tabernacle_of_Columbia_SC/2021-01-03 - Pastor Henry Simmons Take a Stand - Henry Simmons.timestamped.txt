[26:12] for this day that the Lord has made and
[26:15] it's New Year that God has blessed us to
[26:17] see another year we certainly appreciate
[26:20] the Lord doing that for us we know that
[26:24] the
[26:26] expectations you know must
[26:29] be high we not might not
[26:34] set low expectation we
[26:37] must expect God to do great things in
[26:40] our
[26:43] lives we must expect spiritual and
[26:46] naturally that God bless us in every
[26:51] way you know
[26:53] that if you don't set
[26:56] expectations you have nothing to work
[27:00] towards but we say to you
[27:03] that you ought to set goals and try to
[27:06] achieve the goals that God has put in
[27:08] your heart and pray
[27:10] God let me work
[27:13] towards something in this year
[27:16] 20 21 let me work
[27:20] towards my spiritual growth as well as
[27:24] my natural
[27:25] growth and let me oh
[27:29] evaluate let me evaluate constantly
[27:31] where I am spiritually Where I
[27:34] Am Naturally the goals that I set things
[27:38] that I want to achieve in
[27:40] [Music]
[27:42] God sometimes
[27:43] we we don't set a Mark we don't set a
[27:47] goal I believe that Paul he had
[27:51] expectations and he had a Mark that he
[27:53] was pressing
[27:55] towards and he knew that there was a m
[27:58] that
[27:59] he was looking forward to reaching that
[28:03] M I believe at the end of the
[28:06] road he realized that he had fought a
[28:09] good
[28:11] fight he had a course he had a race to
[28:13] run he had a course to run he said I
[28:16] finish my
[28:17] course you
[28:21] know knowing that your life has
[28:25] a a meaning knowing that your life has
[28:30] importance and
[28:32] purpose if you know that brother and
[28:35] sister as you Embark or as you look to
[28:41] 2021 let us oh go look to
[28:45] Jesus the Bible said Mark the perfect
[28:50] man as we look to
[28:53] those with high
[28:56] expectation see Paul said I I press
[28:59] towards the Mark or the prize of the
[29:02] what high you know I'm not see sometimes
[29:07] we we we're not setting our goals up
[29:10] high
[29:11] enough we becomeing comfortable and
[29:14] satisfied just with coming to church and
[29:16] just being a
[29:20] Christian just singing a song and just
[29:23] being here just paying your tithes and
[29:25] offering and and and just being faithful
[29:28] [Music]
[29:31] but it's a high calling that I'm
[29:33] pressing towards the mark of the prize
[29:35] of the high
[29:36] calling I want to I want to achieve more
[29:40] this year than last
[29:45] year sudden I talking to Rachel I said
[29:48] you know once you're in your
[29:51] position then you in a place where God
[29:54] can bless
[29:56] you
[29:58] see God can only bless Israel in the in
[30:00] their Homeland and God can only bless
[30:03] the bride in the
[30:05] word because they said if you abide in
[30:07] me and my word abide in you then you can
[30:09] ask what you will and I'll do
[30:11] it until you get in the word then you
[30:14] are missing out on your
[30:16] [Music]
[30:17] blessing if you come to your Homeland
[30:20] which is Christ which is the baptism of
[30:22] the Holy Ghost come to Christ and get in
[30:26] Christ then you have access to all
[30:29] spiritual
[30:31] blessings and all the blessings of
[30:35] heaven but to not to be on the
[30:40] outside of your blessings and expect the
[30:42] blessings that
[30:44] come to you on the outside of the
[30:48] promise but brother and sister we must
[30:50] come back to our position in Christ and
[30:54] our
[30:55] placing where the bride supposed to be
[30:58] in this
[30:59] age where the church is supposed to be
[31:03] for this particular time that we living
[31:07] in so there are standards that we must
[31:14] reach then you must know what God
[31:17] expecting for your life and what you are
[31:19] to achieve in this
[31:23] age and then once you know what the will
[31:26] of God for the brother
[31:27] for the church in this age then you must
[31:30] press towards the
[31:36] mark let me just read here in numbers
[31:41] 13 and we're talking this morning about
[31:45] taking a
[31:48] stand for you can look around and in the
[31:52] school on the job and in the community
[31:54] and even in
[31:56] family
[31:58] and you can see all the the chaos and
[32:01] all the stuff that is
[32:05] happening you can see people are out of
[32:07] position they're not living as
[32:10] Christians ought to live and they're not
[32:12] walking as chrisan ought to
[32:14] [Music]
[32:18] walk just because we say we a bride just

[35:37] before Moses and said let us go up at
[35:41] once and possess it for we are well able
[35:46] to overcome it but the men that went up
[35:50] with him said we're not able to go up
[35:55] against the people for they are stronger
[35:59] than we and they bought up an evil
[36:03] report of the land which they had
[36:08] searched unto the children of Israel
[36:10] saying the
[36:12] [Music]
[36:13] land through which we have gone to
[36:17] search it it is is a land that eateth up
[36:22] the inhabitants thereof and all the
[36:26] people that we saw in it were
[36:31] men of a great
[36:35] stature and there we saw the Giants Lord
[36:40] have mercy the son of
[36:43] an which come unto the of the
[36:46] Giants and we were in our own sight as
[36:53] Grasshoppers and so we were in in their
[36:57] sight God bless you in this word you may
[37:00] be
[37:04] seated you
[37:05] know in their understanding they saw
[37:11] themselves as Grasshoppers
[37:14] and and they were speaking
[37:18] for the enemy and they said the enemy
[37:21] sees us the same
[37:24] way you know there are many obstacles in
[37:26] our lives and I'm talking about stand
[37:28] taking a
[37:30] stand there are situations and
[37:33] conditions that would cause us to give
[37:37] up it's easy to give up when they think
[37:40] all the odds against
[37:43] you some folks said why try I I I I've
[37:46] tried my best to live a Godly life but I
[37:49] got all odds against
[37:52] me I tried to go to church and I tried
[37:55] to live the best I could could but look
[37:57] like all the odds are stack against
[38:01] me and sometimes we don't
[38:03] know why the test when we tried to do
[38:06] our
[38:08] best we don't know why we have to go
[38:10] through certain things and sometimes we
[38:12] just give up on
[38:16] it maybe that's the way um Caleb and
[38:20] Joshua felt that after coming out God
[38:23] had given them the promised land but
[38:25] there were enemies that were in the land
[38:28] that God had given
[38:31] them and those enemies that was in that
[38:34] Land look like they were
[38:37] so great and so powerful that they
[38:40] thought they might as well not even
[38:43] tried you know what what happens when we
[38:46] don't
[38:49] try but there were I I I'm talking about
[38:52] when you got thousands upon thousands of
[38:55] people all around you they telling you
[38:57] what you can't
[39:00] do are you with
[39:02] me you might have all kind of reports
[39:05] the doctor's report you might look at
[39:08] every situation that's somewhat like job
[39:11] J amen looked at every condition lost
[39:14] his children lost his cattle lost
[39:16] everything he had on the sick bed and
[39:20] even his wife turn on
[39:23] him seem like somebody like that ought
[39:26] to you'll say ain't no you should figh
[39:28] no more I might as well give
[39:32] up and when you got the odds against you
[39:35] brother Joshua when you got almost two
[39:37] million people telling you what you
[39:39] can't do and what God but you got the
[39:42] word of the Lord and the word of the
[39:44] Lord say Amen the land is yours go and
[39:47] possess
[39:48] it ain't that right God Amen you know

[40:02] you I I I'm going to take this stand for
[40:05] God regardless how bad it look how ter
[40:09] it look amen

[40:32] place sometime you know I don't belong
[40:34] where do I
[40:36] belong are you with me sometimes we we
[40:39] we find ourselves in in in predicaments
[40:43] and amen and and look like why should I
[40:46] stand is nobody else
[40:48] standing you know the whole church is G
[40:51] haywire and look look like uh Joshua and
[40:54] Caleb could have took the attitude if if
[40:57] the whole whole congregation to two
[40:59] million people why should I
[41:04] stand why should I trust God when nobody
[41:07] else is trusting
[41:10] God they better looked around and look
[41:12] for somebody to encourage them but
[41:14] nobody wanted to encourage
[41:16] them they out 12 Spies and only two came
[41:20] back with a good report the rest of them

[47:45] with me because you're standing and it
[47:48] look like you're standing by yourself
[47:50] but don't worry about a thing amen cuz
[47:53] God will never leave you and he will
[47:55] never forsake you you know it it it was
[47:58] it was very much because Joseph was a a
[48:01] dreamer and he he had dreams and you
[48:04] know he he had a prophetic gift inside
[48:07] of him and his brothers were jealous of
[48:09] him and his father loved him and a and
[48:13] because of that he was persecuted
[48:15] brother and sister when God bless you
[48:17] you're going to be persecuted your
[48:19] family and though they love you they
[48:21] don't understand you amen sometime your
[48:25] father and mother didn't understand
[48:27] Joseph and they thought Joseph something
[48:29] wrong with you you going to be exalted
[48:31] above mama daddy and all of oh Lord
[48:34] something wrong with this boy but you
[48:37] nevertheless Joseph couldn't do nothing
[48:40] with the gift that God had placed in him
[48:42] and brother and sister don't you know
[48:44] God has brought you to a place and a
[48:46] position that God would like to use you
[48:48] but you don't know amen that amen God
[48:52] using you you might have to go through
[48:54] some things to get where God can use you
[48:56] to be a blessing to your brother and
[48:58] your sister and to your
[48:59] family amen Joseph had to go through
[49:03] some stuff amen but God
[49:06] Amen he
[49:11] says thou shall walk before me in white
[49:15] for they are worthy
[49:17] amen he that over comth the same shall
[49:21] be clothed in white L
[49:23] remen and I will not lot his name out of
[49:26] the book of life but I will confess his
[49:30] name before my father and before his
[49:34] angels God he'll do things for you if
[49:38] you take a stand you know I thought
[49:40] about
[49:41] Overcomers it's not many people that are
[49:44] victorious in this age but there's a few
[49:48] there's a few a faithful few that amen
[49:51] that's going to take a stand and and and
[49:53] they'll be victorious
[49:56] amen he he said uh he shorten the days
[49:59] for the elect sake so there'll be a few
[50:02] that take a stand that those that are
[50:05] chosen in God before the foundation of
[50:07] the world and they will take a stand for
[50:09] God the rest of them brother and sister
[50:11] I'mma tell you something if God word
[50:14] ought to be worth you giving up this
[50:17] world and everything in it amen because
[50:19] you know the inside of the word of God
[50:21] that's where your blessings are and and
[50:25] you cannot beat God giving if you give
[50:27] God your best amen God will give you
[50:30] more than you ever could ever give
[50:32] him amen God will bless you in so many
[50:36] ways you don't even know where your
[50:37] blessing's coming from because you're
[50:39] willing to make a sacrifice amen for the
[50:42] word God I know your word will take care
[50:44] of
[50:45] me amen your word is a lamp unto my feet
[50:49] and light to my P God you'll take care
[50:51] of me Hallelujah so I'm not worried
[50:55] about amen as long as I abide in that
[50:57] word and long as I let God lead me and
[51:00] he'll keep
[51:03] me I'm going tell you something uh uh
[51:06] Genesis 50 uh it it looks a little uh
[51:11] uh tough sometimes but uh brother and
[51:15] sister in the midst of the odds that are
[51:18] against you I want you to know that God
[51:21] will bless you when All Odds Against you
[51:23] that's a that's the best time
[51:27] now how can uh all this that Joseph went
[51:31] through and how can
[51:34] God when your present distress the
[51:36] present things that you go through you
[51:38] can never see good in what you're going
[51:41] to
[51:42] sometimes you can hold up your hand say
[51:45] why mean why do I have to go through
[51:47] this why do I have to go through
[51:48] sickness why do I have to go through
[51:50] amen sometimes disappointed in marriage
[51:53] disappointed in family disappoint poting
[51:55] in dit why should I go through all of
[51:58] this other people seem to be you know
[52:00] going
[52:02] on but me why do I have to go through
[52:06] it but brothers and sisters I believe if
[52:10] Joseph would have thought about what he
[52:12] was going through amen it was something
[52:15] about him being a man of integrity a man
[52:18] that had you know that had God in her
[52:21] and knowing that God was with her
[52:22] regardless of what I'm going
[52:24] through and regardless of what I'm going
[52:26] through somehow amen I I'm not gonna
[52:29] give up on
[52:30] God and that's the way Joel was I'm not
[52:32] gonna give up on God I lost everything
[52:34] but I'm not going to lose you
[52:36] God Amen I'm not going to lose God I'm
[52:39] going to take a stand for God Amen my
[52:41] wife I you you say what you want you
[52:43] talk like one of the foolish women but
[52:45] that's all right I'mma hold on to
[52:47] God brother and sister you got to take a
[52:49] stand hold to God's unchanging hand
[52:51] regardless of how bad it
[52:53] look amen you might be going going down
[52:55] the Lonely Road of life and things ain't
[52:58] happening like you thought they would
[52:59] happen you praise
[53:02] God I'm saying things ain't happening
[53:04] like you want them to happen and things
[53:06] that you you expecting to happen but
[53:09] they it's not going to come in that
[53:11] way sometimes it might come amen around
[53:14] another angle for what you looking and
[53:17] expecting but it'll get down anyway if
[53:20] you keep your eyes on the
[53:22] prize seek you first the kingdom with
[53:25] God and his righteousness and all other
[53:27] things will be added God going to take
[53:29] care of
[53:35] business 15 and 20 Genesis 1520 he says
[53:42] but as for you Joseph Brothers was
[53:44] worrying about after Jacob died whether
[53:47] Joseph was going to take revenge on him
[53:49] for what they done to their brothers you
[53:51] see what I'm saying and how they sold
[53:53] him in the
[53:56] and gave him up are you with me you know
[53:59] Joseph had reached the place in Egypt
[54:02] that he was next to
[54:04] pharaoh and he had saved his brothers
[54:06] and his
[54:08] family but after the dad died they
[54:10] thought hey our brother going to turn on
[54:12] us now you can you see people treating
[54:16] you so bad yet there's no Envy no
[54:18] bitterness in your
[54:20] heart are you with
[54:22] me see what what happened
[54:28] and the Bible said in the 19th verse and
[54:30] Joseph said unto them fear not for I
[54:34] am in the place of God but as for
[54:39] you ye what you thought evil against me
[54:45] you see sometimes you you don't want to
[54:47] forgive those that thought evil against
[54:49] you you don't want to forgive uhuh I
[54:52] never forgive them Joseph said you
[54:55] thought evil against me I'm going to
[54:56] tell you something brothers and sisters
[54:58] the thing that people do to you and done
[55:00] to you in your life you can never get to
[55:03] the right place where God want you to be
[55:05] except you go down certain
[55:08] courses you know what it's like to hurt
[55:10] you know what it's like to have pain you
[55:11] know what it's like to suffer
[55:13] persecution you know what when you're
[55:15] right and somebody lied on you somebody
[55:17] oh are you with
[55:19] me see but once you go through it then
[55:22] How Sweet It Is to know that you've been
[55:25] through it and then you can have the
[55:27] right attitude of
[55:31] forgiveness you know it takes God to
[55:34] give you the attitude that you can
[55:35] forgive those that hurt you so bad done
[55:38] you so wrong Jo Joseph would have said I
[55:41] never would have had to go to prison I
[55:43] never but if he didn't go to prison he
[55:45] didn't go through the things he would
[55:46] never be in the position that he's in
[55:48] now it's a lot of things that I had to
[55:50] go through in life and sitting down and
[55:53] you know talking uh Rachel last night
[55:56] and I was telling some things but I
[55:58] would have never been able to
[56:00] enjoy I think Joseph probably had a a
[56:04] wonderful time with his
[56:05] Brethren you know I'm saying Lord y'all
[56:08] might have thought it y'all was doing me
[56:10] wrong but it was a blessing and brothers
[56:13] don't worry about a thing God meant it

[1:00:18] to finish I thought we'd do double
[1:00:20] hitter so he's
[1:00:23] going
[1:00:29] you enjoy the word this
[1:00:31] morning amen God is good
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:36] Lord taking a stand amen I thought about
[1:00:40] it as he was ministering how when the
[1:00:42] Lord first saved me and how many times
[1:00:45] and I can look back and say I had to
[1:00:47] take a stand amen take a stand against
[1:00:50] family take a stand against friends and
[1:00:53] all it it wasn't wasn't an easy Road it
[1:00:56] was a lonely road sometimes but
[1:00:59] nevertheless God saw me through it amen
[1:01:02] and I can look at where I was and look
[1:01:04] at where I am now somebody said that
[1:01:07] that I might not be where I want to be
[1:01:10] but I or I might not be what I want to
[1:01:12] be or supposed to be but I ain't what I
[1:01:14] used to be amen because God is his his
[1:01:18] brought us a mighty long way and we
[1:01:20] thank the Lord for that you know I
[1:01:22] thought about the testimonies this
[1:01:24] morning and how you know when the Lord
[1:01:26] first saved me and how you know I was on
[1:01:30] a job and you know he's blessing you on
[1:01:32] the job and they wanted to elevate you
[1:01:35] you know at an early age and make you
[1:01:37] supervisor but the only problem was that
[1:01:40] they was going to put me on another
[1:01:42] shift and I would have to miss all my
[1:01:44] church services during the week so you
[1:01:47] know sometimes we look at things and say
[1:01:49] oh that's a blessing come on but I
[1:01:52] always said to myself I said Lord you
[1:01:55] mean more to me than anything you know I
[1:01:58] made a promise to the Lord when I was at
[1:02:00] my lowest place I said Lord if you if
[1:02:03] you get me from where I am right now I
[1:02:06] said God I remember in a Motel 6 praying
[1:02:09] one morning I said Lord if you help me
[1:02:13] if you get me from where I am right now
[1:02:15] I said Lord I'll to the best of my
[1:02:16] ability I'll serve you all the days of
[1:02:18] my life I said and I won't turn I won't
[1:02:21] turn around I said now I know it ain't
[1:02:23] going to be easy God I said but if you
[1:02:25] help me I said I won't go back and I
[1:02:28] always remembered that so what happens
[1:02:31] you know a lot of times the Lord start
[1:02:32] blessing you and the devil try to throw
[1:02:35] things all in your way to try to deter
[1:02:37] you come on but I always remember I
[1:02:40] always remember where God brought me
[1:02:42] from and I said Lord if you hadn't
[1:02:44] stepped in at my lowest place if you
[1:02:47] hadn't to stepped in just when I needed
[1:02:50] you the most God I wouldn't even be here
[1:02:53] today so no no matter what the devil got
[1:02:55] to offer no matter what the world got to
[1:02:57] offer Lord you mean more to me than
[1:02:59] anything because the devil LED you out
[1:03:01] there on the ledge and he left you out
[1:03:03] there come on left you out there to die
[1:03:05] he brought you out there to a place and
[1:03:07] he left you out there come on Soul on
[1:03:10] the way going to hell but I like that
[1:03:12] how they says when Jesus found me come
[1:03:15] on and wrapped his loving arms around me
[1:03:18] come on I think about when nothing else
[1:03:20] could help Love Lifted Me come on
[1:03:23] whenever everything else fell Love
[1:03:25] Lifted Me and I thought about that I
[1:03:27] said you know I was on the job and they
[1:03:30] they want you to be supervisor and all
[1:03:33] it's some years back and wanted you to
[1:03:35] miss church and I said you know I says I
[1:03:37] I says I can't do it I said said you
[1:03:39] going to turn this money down I says I
[1:03:41] got to be in the church and they asked
[1:03:43] me they said well well what's going on
[1:03:44] on Tuesdays and Friday nights where you
[1:03:46] got to be there I said I just got to be
[1:03:49] there there nothing I I said I just got
[1:03:52] to be there to hear the word of of the
[1:03:54] Lord I just got to be in that presence
[1:03:56] you know and they call me called the the
[1:03:59] operations manager and all that that
[1:04:00] they said earners we we need you to work
[1:04:02] not what would it take you know and I I
[1:04:05] said I I can't it's not that I'm not
[1:04:08] sacrificing come on sometimes you know
[1:04:11] the devil will offer you this come on
[1:04:13] it's a tradeoff if you do this like like
[1:04:16] he told Jesus if you Bow Down and
[1:04:18] Worship me I give you all this come on
[1:04:21] if you do this I'll do this right here
[1:04:22] come on trade off I want to say the
[1:04:24] devil can't give you nothing come on
[1:04:27] without something in return that he want
[1:04:29] and that something in return might cost
[1:04:31] you your soul how many believe that this
[1:04:33] morning but you know what I'm saying uh
[1:04:36] sitting there and uh you know they begin
[1:04:38] to say they they tell me they says you
[1:04:39] know we like they going to threaten to
[1:04:41] fire you if you don't take the
[1:04:43] position and they said you know God know
[1:04:46] you need a job that's what they told me
[1:04:49] and I said God gave me this job and
[1:04:51] he'll give me another one is what I told
[1:04:53] him they said oh okay and they say like
[1:04:56] they threaten to fire you so they tell
[1:04:57] you can leave I got up to walk out the
[1:05:00] office and they say you know they told
[1:05:02] me they say hey Ernest come on back in
[1:05:04] here they say close the door they say I
[1:05:06] tell you what we going to do we really
[1:05:07] need you to work this this other shift

[1:05:13] right well what we'll do when church
[1:05:15] service time come you can go into church
[1:05:17] and just come back after church and they
[1:05:19] said what what we want you to do don't
[1:05:20] even worry about clocking out we're
[1:05:22] going to pay you to go to church now you
[1:05:24] tell me when you take a stand for God
[1:05:26] come on what won't God do for you you
[1:05:29] know I said that's my testimony this
[1:05:31] whole Christian journey is built on what
[1:05:34] taking stands come on you know when you
[1:05:36] think that the trial is over come on you
[1:05:38] got something else God got something
[1:05:40] else in store for you but nevertheless
[1:05:42] the way you stood the first time you
[1:05:44] just keep standing for God and watch
[1:05:45] what God do you know this morning I
[1:05:48] thank the Lord for being here this
[1:05:50] morning and I know we had uh even today
[1:05:52] at work you know it was mandatory I was
[1:05:55] telling the the pastor the other day it
[1:05:58] was mandatory that we all had to be
[1:06:00] there this week and I was saying you
[1:06:01] know I didn't even know whether I was
[1:06:03] going to be able to go to sh mandatory

[1:06:17] now and then you know sometimes you
[1:06:19] might have to be in is what I said come
[1:06:20] on but nevertheless I was telling them
[1:06:24] the other day I said the boss came up to
[1:06:26] me just out of the blue and he said
[1:06:28] Ernest he said I know you like to go to
[1:06:30] church said I know you like to be in
[1:06:32] God's house he said and I don't mind
[1:06:34] that he said I don't mind that he said I
[1:06:36] tell you what we can do he said we
[1:06:38] everybody got to be here but you can
[1:06:39] just go on go to church that what he
[1:06:41] said and just come in just come in after
[1:06:43] church and make your time up do however
[1:06:45] he said I don't mind that he said matter
[1:06:47] of fact if we get a lot of work done he
[1:06:48] said then you won't even have to come in
[1:06:50] Sunday he says but I'm I'm going to do
[1:06:52] that he said cuz I know and that's the
[1:06:53] thing about it you know uh uh people are
[1:06:56] watching you come on people a lot of
[1:06:58] people profess Christianity and profess
[1:07:00] to be saved but people are watching your
[1:07:02] life they're watching what you doing
[1:07:04] they watching what they coming out your
[1:07:05] mouth something coming out your mouth
[1:07:07] but they seeing something else in your
[1:07:09] life and they can't respect that come on
[1:07:12] but when they see that you you are real
[1:07:14] come on that you you standing for God
[1:07:17] and you not not just on Sunday but come
[1:07:19] on on Monday and Tuesdays and Wednesday
[1:07:21] you a Christian every day come on there
[1:07:24] respect that Hallelujah and God will do
[1:07:27] something great for you how many believe
[1:07:28] that this
[1:07:30] morning you know I was going to minister
[1:07:32] today uh by the grace of God I was going
[1:07:35] to minister on moving on come on I was
[1:07:38] going to minister on moving on and I
[1:07:40] says that you know I was going to you
[1:07:42] know I won't even get go in uh to the to
[1:07:45] the scripture but I says that you know
[1:07:47] it's hard sometimes moving on when we
[1:07:50] come to Crossroads in life you a lot of
[1:07:53] time times we hit those Crossroads you
[1:07:56] know and and God what he's wanting to do
[1:07:59] he's wan to elevate you he's wanting to
[1:08:01] take you to another place and sometimes
[1:08:04] we so tied to the past or we so tied to
[1:08:07] the things that are behind us that when
[1:08:10] God wants to take us and move us forward
[1:08:12] it's hard for us to move on but I was
[1:08:15] reminded how you know at the Red Sea you
[1:08:19] know uh God told Israel you know Moses
[1:08:22] speaking to him he says that the
[1:08:24] Egyptians you see today he said after
[1:08:27] this day you won't see them no more ever
[1:08:29] again he said God is going to fight for
[1:08:31] you he said I want you to speak to the
[1:08:33] children I want you to tell them to move
[1:08:35] forward come on I want you to go on come
[1:08:37] on and from that day you know when God
[1:08:40] took care of their enemies they were
[1:08:42] supposed to move on they were supposed
[1:08:44] to forget you know their troubles that
[1:08:46] was behind them and move on with God but
[1:08:50] the problem was that even though they
[1:08:52] moved on physically physically their
[1:08:55] hearts were still back there though they
[1:08:58] moved on with their bodies and they they
[1:09:00] took all their possessions and all that
[1:09:02] their minds were still in bondage their
[1:09:05] hearts were still stuck back there in
[1:09:08] the past they they they physically what
[1:09:11] we'll say moved on but yet they were
[1:09:13] still in bondage in their Spirit come on
[1:09:16] but I said today God when he what when
[1:09:19] the one that God sets free he's free
[1:09:22] indeed he don't want you just to move uh
[1:09:25] physically and just have a physical
[1:09:27] change but God wants to do something
[1:09:30] down on the inside come on that's why he
[1:09:32] told Nicodemus you must be born again
[1:09:35] reason why you can't understand my
[1:09:37] speech because you got to be converted
[1:09:40] Hallelujah where all things have become
[1:09:42] new the things that you are uh you at
[1:09:45] your Crossroad now I come to deliver you
[1:09:48] not just to make you look good on the
[1:09:50] outside but I want to do something on
[1:09:52] the inside that there after this day you
[1:09:55] don't have to worry about them no more
[1:09:57] Hallelujah a trans a transformation has
[1:10:00] to take
[1:10:01] place we find that I said come on we got
[1:10:04] to move on we find that the children of
[1:10:07] Israel in Egypt I mean I mean in the
[1:10:09] wilderness they never moved on come on
[1:10:11] because every time something happened
[1:10:13] they says oh how good we had it in Egypt
[1:10:17] how good we had it back there come on
[1:10:19] and they said you should have left us
[1:10:21] back there come on but God you know
[1:10:24] wanted them to move on from that come on
[1:10:27] Hallelujah and that's what we do I said
[1:10:30] sometimes we get caught up and will we
[1:10:32] find ourselves looking back Hallelujah
[1:10:35] and if you don't watch it the devil have
[1:10:37] you saying that these were the good old
[1:10:39] days come on those were the good old
[1:10:41] days hallelujah the good old days when
[1:10:44] you were in bondage some was bound to
[1:10:47] alcohol some was bound to drugs some was
[1:10:50] bound to prostitution the devil had you
[1:10:52] beat up shaking you couldn't even hold
[1:10:55] your head up in the house of God come on
[1:10:57] but you look back and the devil will
[1:10:59] trick you and say that those were the
[1:11:00] good old days hallelujah no the good
[1:11:05] days started when God came by Hallelujah
[1:11:08] and begin to speak the word hallelujah
[1:11:12] Satan let my people go let them go off
[1:11:15] of alcohol let them go off of drugs and
[1:11:18] lying and cheating Satan Let My People
[1:11:20] Go Hallelujah and the devil had no other
[1:11:23] chice but let you go that's when the
[1:11:25] good old days started that's when the
[1:11:27] Revival started down in your soul when
[1:11:30] you can come in the house of God and you
[1:11:32] Wen shamed to scream out Hallelujah you
[1:11:35] wern't shamed to scream out thank you
[1:11:37] Jesus you weren't ashamed to call on
[1:11:39] that name Hallelujah no matter what the
[1:11:42] world was saying about you you was free
[1:11:44] come on I said we got to move on
[1:11:47] Hallelujah I think about that I says
[1:11:50] what it is a a a birth has to take place
[1:11:53] come on a
[1:11:55] transformation the the to kill all those
[1:11:58] lustly desires all those worldly things
[1:12:01] that's in you and take it away come on
[1:12:04] you have no remembrance for those things
[1:12:07] the things that had you bound I like
[1:12:09] that sing that song God has delivered me
[1:12:11] why should I be bound Hallelujah you can
[1:12:14] be free to worship God you can be free
[1:12:17] to go and serve the Lord come on you
