[30:45] very familiar still
[30:47] was here in the book of
[30:48] joshua i know my brother caleb i mean i
[30:50] said from last week but we still was
[30:52] here in
[30:53] the same place by the grace of god
[30:56] joshua 1
[30:57] and 1.
[30:59] if you got it say amen
[31:02] and it reads
[31:03] now after the death of moses the servant
[31:06] of the lord it came to pass that the
[31:08] lord spake unto joshua the son of nun
[31:11] moses minister saying
[31:13] moses my servant is dead now
[31:15] now therefore arise and go over this
[31:18] jordan thou and all this people unto the
[31:21] land which i do give to them even to the
[31:23] children of israel
[31:25] every place that the soul of your foot
[31:27] shall tread upon
[31:28] that have i given unto you as i said
[31:31] unto moses from the wilderness and this
[31:34] lebanon even until the great river the
[31:37] river euphrates and all the and all the
[31:40] land of the hittites and unto the great
[31:42] sea toward the going down of the sun
[31:45] shall be your coast there should not
[31:48] any man be able to stand before thee all
[31:51] the days of thy life as i was with moses
[31:55] so i will be with thee
[31:57] i will not fail thee nor for safety
[32:00] be strong and of good courage for unto
[32:03] this people shall thou divide for an
[32:06] inheritance to the land in which i swear
[32:09] until their fathers to give them only be
[32:11] thou strong and very courageous that
[32:13] thou mayest observed to do according to
[32:15] all the law which moses my servant
[32:17] commanded thee turn not from it
[32:20] to the right hand or to the left that
[32:23] thou mayest prosper which so ever thou
[32:25] goest
[32:26] this book of the laws shall not depart
[32:28] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[32:30] therein day and night and thou
[32:33] and that thou mayest observe to do
[32:35] according to all that is written therein
[32:37] for then
[32:38] thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[32:41] then
[32:42] doubt shall have good success
[32:45] have not i commanded thee be strong and
[32:48] of good courage be not afraid neither be
[32:52] dismayed for the lord thy god is with
[32:55] thee whatsoever thou goest may god bless
[32:58] the reading of his word may be seated
[33:01] tonight just for a moment i want to
[33:04] minister to you on something
[33:06] and i entitled it as i was
[33:09] so shall i be amen
[33:11] as i was so shall i be
[33:14] you know we here
[33:16] we're living in hours
[33:18] we were sharing you know the last week
[33:20] or so
[33:21] that
[33:22] you know one thing we got to remember
[33:25] that we're not serving a historical god
[33:29] but we're serving a a living god
[33:33] a god that
[33:34] as he was so he is now so a lot of times
[33:39] like i was sharing with the the people
[33:41] the other sunday i said you know you can
[33:43] try to you know get painted i mean get
[33:46] on warm by painted fire it won't do you
[33:48] no good
[33:49] you can see the fire but you can't it
[33:51] won't it's not giving giving off no heat
[33:53] generating is just a it's just a picture
[33:56] of something to you come on like a like
[33:59] that but nevertheless and i said so when
[34:02] we think about god
[34:04] we we don't we don't look at him as just
[34:07] what he has done and what he was capable
[34:10] of and it's not like he say he was
[34:13] capable of this but he's old now he
[34:15] can't do that
[34:16] or he used to could do this but he can't
[34:18] do that no more that's not the god that
[34:20] we serve
[34:21] but the god that we serve and it's not
[34:24] that so much as saying that we're
[34:26] looking that he's going to do these
[34:27] things in the future which we know that
[34:30] he will but
[34:31] we can't miss what he's doing right now
[34:34] you know the jehovah of the old
[34:36] testament is jesus of the new testament
[34:39] and so we says that you know we ain't
[34:41] serving a historical god and we got to
[34:43] get away from that
[34:45] i was sharing with
[34:47] my son moses last night we were just
[34:49] talking and i said you know we was
[34:51] talking about the holy ghost and i asked
[34:53] him how am i going to talk to him about
[34:55] the holy ghost and i said the holy ghost
[34:57] is you know is jesus christ the person
[34:59] living in you
[35:00] i said the same things he done while he
[35:03] walked the face of the earth he says a
[35:04] little while and i'll go away he said
[35:06] but i won't leave you comfortless but
[35:08] i'm gonna send you a comforter which is
[35:10] the holy ghost and when he come in my
[35:12] name come on
[35:13] he is not that he says i'll no longer be
[35:15] with you but i'm gonna be in you
[35:18] i said so the same things that we saw
[35:21] you know in the in in the flesh of jesus
[35:24] christ you know that was just a body god
[35:27] veiled in human flesh
[35:29] i says but that's what it is when the
[35:31] holy ghost comes in you i said you'll
[35:33] know something happened
[35:35] it's not just a feeling say i felt good
[35:38] but you'll know that he has come
[35:40] you'll know that a change has taken
[35:42] place and i said that's what
[35:45] you you strive for not just for a shower
[35:48] or feeling i felt this anointing many
[35:50] felt this anointing but they can't
[35:52] produce the life
[35:53] many felt this presence but they can't
[35:55] live nothing
[35:56] they might walk for a long time but yet
[35:59] they can't walk right come on
[36:01] they can meditate read the bible day in
[36:03] and out but until the word gets in you
[36:06] until the word comes in your heart come
[36:08] on
[36:09] and he causes you to walk in his statues
[36:11] then it ain't going to do you no good
[36:13] come on so i began to talk when i'm like
[36:16] that last night and i could feel god's
[36:18] presence because it's real
[36:20] because when you talking about it as i
[36:22] was sharing with them i said what it is
[36:24] it'll be that inner voice come on i says
[36:27] wherever you go he'll be with you
[36:29] you might sometimes say you don't you
[36:32] don't you might not say i don't feel him
[36:34] like that but he's there come on he's
[36:36] with you that inner voice is going to
[36:37] speak to you it's going he gonna he
[36:39] gonna lead and guide you i said it's not
[36:41] that you know i was sharing i said the
[36:43] thing is i says you don't want to do
[36:45] nothing to hurt you how would you want
[36:47] to do something to hurt your mom and dad
[36:50] you do things and you sometimes you
[36:51] think about how would that make my mom
[36:53] and dad feel if they know i've done it
[36:55] because you respect him you don't want
[36:56] to hurt your mom and dad and i says but
[36:59] you know christ i mean god he is our
[37:01] father
[37:02] so when we conduct ourselves you know
[37:04] what the holy ghost teaches us
[37:06] you don't want to do nothing that'll
[37:07] hurt god
[37:09] you always want to walk according to
[37:11] what what he wants you to walk
[37:13] so what we do we begin to ask god we say
[37:16] god you know me
[37:19] nobody else don't know you like god know
[37:21] you you realize that
[37:23] god knows you
[37:25] god knows things about you that you
[37:26] don't even know about yourself
[37:29] you might feel as lord i'll go all the
[37:31] way with you but god know he says come
[37:34] on he says this night before the
[37:36] cockroach uh thrice he says you'll deny
[37:39] even knowing me but i know you intend to
[37:41] do good but you don't you don't have
[37:43] what it takes to go all the way but
[37:44] after you convert it then you strengthen
[37:46] your brothers come on so it's not just a
[37:49] mythical thing but it's the real it's
[37:52] the deity it's him it's christ himself
[37:54] come on the hope of glory coming and
[37:56] living in you
[37:58] then you know then that the struggle is
[37:59] over it's not that i'm i'm worried about
[38:02] oh i might fail god i might go back the
[38:04] struggle is over because he's here now
[38:07] and he's in control he's got in the ship
[38:10] he's leading and guiding so i'm not
[38:11] worried about those things what it is
[38:13] because i know that in the hour when i
[38:15] need him he'll show up
[38:17] how many believe that
[38:19] i really believe that because it's true
[38:21] it happens all the time and i said you
[38:23] know it's something the prophet of god
[38:25] was saying and it kind of stirred in my
[38:27] heart he was saying that you know jesus
[38:29] he defeated satan and all of his and all
[38:32] of his power with the written word of
[38:34] god
[38:35] come on
[38:36] he defeated satan in all his power with
[38:39] the written word of god
[38:40] first real battle conflict that he came
[38:43] in while on this earth with satan what
[38:46] how did he defeat defeat him with the
[38:48] written word of god
[38:50] because what's written in the book
[38:52] that's that can stand the bible says
[38:54] heaven and earth will pass away
[38:56] didn't say that but my word will not
[38:58] pass away right
[39:00] that's how powerful the word of god is
[39:03] atomic explosion things will blow this
[39:04] world up but the word of god is still
[39:06] stand the word of god is still staying
[39:09] true if he said i'll bring it forth he
[39:11] gonna bring it forth no matter what uh a
[39:14] circumstance or situation is holding on
[39:16] you come on
[39:17] you know it was said that the god he can
[39:20] defeat the devil on any place
[39:22] at any time and under any circumstances
[39:26] there ain't nothing too hard for the
[39:27] lord how many believe that tonight
[39:30] i believe that
[39:31] with all of my heart
[39:32] so we find that i says you know so we we
[39:35] know that we're not serving a a
[39:37] historical god but we're serving a real
[39:40] god
[39:41] a god a living and so
[39:44] i'm i'm stirred
[39:46] because i want to see him as he was i
[39:48] want to see him
[39:51] you know i can see here a great
[39:53] salutation that that joshua god come to
[39:56] joshua and begin to speak to him he says
[40:00] he says moses my servant is dead now
[40:02] come on
[40:03] a lot of times you know we do depend on
[40:06] as just just being a in the flesh
[40:08] sometimes you do look up to great men
[40:11] and how god use mighty men and all and
[40:14] sometimes we look to them and and for
[40:17] dependence we look to them for
[40:18] leadership sometimes
[40:21] just being in the flesh but nevertheless
[40:23] you know
[40:25] it ain't the man but it's what what's
[40:28] veiled behind the man's skin come on
[40:31] it's not that we look at the man but we
[40:33] we we're we're not really seeing the
[40:35] works of the man we're seeing the works
[40:37] of god in the man
[40:39] come on and that's what
[40:41] the man of god i believe that when he
[40:44] ministers the gospel what does he want
[40:46] to do leads you to a living god
[40:49] i want to show you that he says the
[40:51] words that i do you will do also he said
[40:53] in my name you'll cast out devils he
[40:56] said these signs shall follow them that
[40:58] believe not just the preachers not just
[41:01] the prophets he said but to them that
[41:03] believe these signs will follow them in
[41:05] my name come on
[41:07] call on his name
[41:09] he said in my name you'll cast out
[41:11] devils you'll lay hands on the sick and
[41:13] they shall recover he said these sounds
[41:15] he said to to them that believe so what
[41:18] it is you want them to see that come on
[41:20] it's god himself he's among you he's
[41:23] living in you he's veiled not only
[41:24] behind the preacher but he's railing you
[41:26] and you as an individual
[41:29] do you believe that
[41:31] so we come to that place that i believe
[41:34] that like i said we look at great men
[41:37] and that's a sometimes a stumbling block
[41:39] because when god moved that man off the
[41:41] scene sometimes people feel like well
[41:43] what are we going to do
[41:45] because the great man
[41:46] now has been moved off of the scene
[41:49] they still look for that great man
[41:51] but i love how how god come to encourage
[41:54] joshua first thing he told him moses my
[41:57] servant is dead now come on
[41:59] he going on
[42:01] he says but as i was with him
[42:04] so i'm gonna be with you the same way
[42:07] as i was i'm still here and i'm still
[42:09] the same guard
[42:10] so he's dead he's gone on i want you to
[42:12] remember what he told you now
[42:14] he said i want you to remember that but
[42:16] don't look to him you look to me now
[42:18] come on
[42:19] and that's what it is come on i says we
[42:21] ought to look to jesus
[42:23] look
[42:24] look into the altar and the finisher of
[42:26] our faith
[42:28] jesus started me on the journey and
[42:30] jesus helped me finish the journey come
[42:31] on
[42:32] what it is if you got saved because you
[42:35] followed a man then that's wrong it's
[42:37] messed up from the beginning but if
[42:39] something one day pricked your heart
[42:41] and said that when their hearts were
[42:42] pricked they said me and the brother
[42:44] what shall we do why because their
[42:46] hearts would pray
[42:47] something gotta hold to them and let
[42:50] them know that i need a savior they
[42:52] started right come on and when they
[42:54] start it right
[42:56] god can help him lead find the rest of
[42:58] the way how many believe that
[43:01] so we find like i said he give him that
[43:03] salutation as we said as i was so shall
[43:06] i be so
[43:08] talking to joshua that way come on
[43:11] and you can see joshua i could see that
[43:15] salutation maybe they go back in their
[43:16] minds
[43:18] of how mighty
[43:19] uh how god used moses like never before
[43:22] how god
[43:24] used
[43:25] moses in a way that he never done he
[43:27] spoke the most in a way like he never
[43:29] done ever in history at that time come
[43:31] on he says he says if a man think he's
[43:34] spiritual he says i'll speak to him a
[43:35] dream and so forth things like that he
[43:38] said but not so with moses he said i
[43:40] speak to him like a man speak to his
[43:42] friend face to face come on so but they
[43:45] i could see he says as i was with him
[43:48] that's how i'm gonna be with you i'm
[43:49] gonna be that same god so no doubt you
[43:52] know the children of israel can when
[43:54] they go on to face their enemies they
[43:56] hadn't they could have no other choice
[43:57] but to go back in their minds
[44:00] and see what god was
[44:02] and know that hey we got a battle now we
[44:05] got to fight but god you promised us
[44:08] that the way you was you're gonna be
[44:10] that same right now so when we go out
[44:12] we're depending on you to be the same
[44:14] just like you said you was now come on
[44:16] you said you'll be with us that same way
[44:18] and we depending on it come on
[44:20] and that's what i say even
[44:22] even here tonight what are we depending
[44:24] on the more the more wicked the hour get
[44:28] and the more you see the yourself uh
[44:31] encamped about all these dark clouds
[44:34] and witnesses that's the more that i
[44:36] don't know about you but i'm starting to
[44:38] learn to let go more
[44:41] and say lord come on we can't fight all
[44:44] these devils
[44:45] it's too many demons to fight how we
[44:48] gonna fight them on our own
[44:50] the ability can't be in us i said god
[44:53] it's gonna take you lord
[44:55] god i'm dependent on you
[44:57] to see us true how many believe that
[44:59] that's what it is the more you see it an
[45:01] environ around us say hey our enemies is
[45:04] encamped all around us
[45:06] now we're seeing these things but god
[45:08] you promised you said that we're
[45:10] overcome by the blood of the lamb and by
[45:13] the word of our testimony come on
[45:15] you said that you're the high priest of
[45:17] our of our confession
[45:19] come on you plead in our case
[45:22] before the throne how many believe that
[45:24] tonight so as we stand here i said god
[45:27] uh uh lord i'm confessing that you're
[45:29] the same yesterday today and forever i'm
[45:31] confessing you're still a healer i'm
[45:33] confessing you're still a provider i'm a
[45:35] profession i'm just going to confess my
[45:37] way through all this darkness
[45:40] i'm going to confess my way through all
[45:42] these trials
[45:43] i'm going to confess my way because he's
[45:45] my high priest i'm gonna confess my way
[45:46] through all these things he's waiting he
[45:48] said they overcome by the blood of the
[45:50] lamb and the word of their testimony
[45:53] come on i was saying talking about that
[45:55] little song the other day
[45:57] uh
[45:58] it says that i know that i can make it
[46:00] come on i know that i can stand no
[46:02] matter what comes my way my life is in
[46:04] his hands come on no matter what you
[46:07] faced with throughout the day i know
[46:09] i'll make it
[46:11] come on
[46:12] i know i ain't got no other choice but
[46:13] to stand
[46:15] when i don't know what to do i ain't got
[46:16] no other choice but to stand
[46:18] hallelujah i'ma wait on guard how many
[46:21] want to wait on him tonight
[46:23] but he says as i was as i was with him
[46:26] so as we said no doubt he had they had
[46:28] no other choice but to go back in their
[46:30] minds and see
[46:32] you know the victories that was one it's
[46:35] good when you can look back at
[46:36] testimonies
[46:38] it's good when you can look back at a
[46:40] real god the problem sometimes be that
[46:42] people never seen god in action
[46:45] they never seen a living guard so they
[46:47] have nothing they can reach back to come
[46:49] on but nevertheless
[46:52] that that shouldn't still stop you
[46:53] because god want he want to be that
[46:55] living god he want to give you those
[46:56] trophies that's why sometimes he let
[46:59] circumstances and uh situations arise
[47:02] so he can show you that hey i'm that
[47:05] mighty guard
[47:06] i'm that deliverer i'm that so we take
[47:09] those things and strive and we look at
[47:11] that says one thing about it as i like
[47:14] how he began to tell joshua uh as he's
[47:17] as beginning to speak to him set out as
[47:19] i was at moses so i'll be with thee he
[47:21] began to speak to him he says i won't
[47:23] fail you
[47:25] come on
[47:27] he said i won't fail you
[47:30] you might fail god but he won't fail you
[47:34] he said you just think about that he
[47:36] said i will not fail you
[47:38] come on
[47:39] in all of your struggling and all of
[47:42] your trials and all of your tribulations
[47:44] he said i will not fail you
[47:48] [Music]
[47:49] he said i won't fail you nor will i
[47:51] forsake you
[47:53] but i'll be with you so wheresoever you
[47:55] go come on
[47:56] he says i've given you the land wherever
[47:59] your feet touch
[48:00] you know this is god speaking to joshua
[48:04] wherever you go you tread upon i'm
[48:06] giving it to you i'm gonna be with you
[48:08] as i was with moses come on
[48:11] i'm gonna be with you i ain't gonna fail
[48:13] you nor forsake you
[48:15] so
[48:16] what it is
[48:17] as i was i was sharing
[48:19] you know me and the kids children were
[48:21] reading how rahab uh uh began to tell
[48:24] the spies you know in a couple chapters
[48:27] away rahab began to tell the spies she
[48:30] says the whole whole everybody know
[48:34] y'all coming come on
[48:35] she said and everybody hearts are
[48:37] trembling
[48:38] and are afraid
[48:40] said their heart is melded because they
[48:42] know that your god has given you the
[48:44] city come on
[48:45] and i say it's what it is that's what
[48:47] the the the you know what the difference
[48:49] between joshua and him and the rest of
[48:52] those armies the rest of those armies
[48:53] might have been more in number but the
[48:55] difference was the supernatural
[48:58] they had the supernatural working among
[48:59] them
[49:00] that's what it is they might have been
[49:01] small in number but they heard how the
[49:04] seeds dried up for your sake they heard
[49:07] of how you destroyed the other kings in
[49:08] the valley they heard what you done to
[49:10] them and all the hearts began to melt
[49:12] then because they heard how god was
[49:14] moving among you and i said that's what
[49:16] it is today demons tremble
[49:19] at that name of jesus don't they come on
[49:22] demons tremble at a church that's got
[49:24] the supernatural among them now a church
[49:26] that's just coming and just gathering
[49:28] just having a good time nobody's living
[49:30] the life nobody's doing right they just
[49:32] living any kind of way and preaching
[49:34] come on the devil ain't afraid of that
[49:35] he might even come to church with you
[49:37] come on
[49:38] but
[49:40] the only thing about it when the
[49:41] supernatural is among them
[49:43] that's what makes a difference
[49:44] how many believe that come on if they
[49:47] were just carrying the ark and just
[49:48] bragging on their guard but no signs and
[49:50] wonders the other cities wouldn't have
[49:52] been afraid but when they see that art
[49:54] coming come on that ark was their glory
[49:57] hallelujah
[49:58] and when they walked in the waters and
[50:00] the waters opening up all the
[50:01] inhabitants of the land melted because
[50:04] of him
[50:05] and i said all today what do we need we
[50:07] need a church that's walking in power
[50:09] church that's walking in authority a
[50:11] church that demons are befrayed come on
[50:14] you know sickness is on people's life
[50:16] when they walk in the door what happened
[50:17] they be healed because of the
[50:19] supernatural
[50:21] hallelujah how many believe that
[50:24] demons can't come in your home why
[50:25] because of the supernatural that's what
[50:27] makes the difference and i said god
[50:29] that's what i want in my life in my home
[50:32] god not just just to be stirred i heard
[50:34] a good sermon but let the difference be
[50:36] the supernatural let the difference be
[50:38] the cloud hallelujah by day in the fire
[50:41] by night let that be the difference
[50:44] how many want that tonight
[50:47] well we find that come on he she said
[50:50] everybody know they're afraid of you
[50:52] ain't it
[50:53] because god god gave you the city they
[50:56] heard of what your god is doing
[50:58] they heard of how he brought you up
[51:01] and he and i and a little further on
[51:03] down they says that you know one day one
[51:06] of the enemies come to make a pact with
[51:08] them come on
[51:10] disguise themselves and made a pact and
[51:12] joshua don't say hey why did y'all do it
[51:14] that way why y'all deceive us he said
[51:15] because we heard what what what uh yo
[51:18] god's servant moses your god servant
[51:21] moses commanded you
[51:23] that when you come in the land destroy
[51:24] all the happiness inhabitants of the
[51:26] land don't leave we heard we heard what
[51:29] what you were told destroy them and we
[51:30] was afraid for our lives come on but
[51:33] what it is i says you know
[51:35] god is real
[51:37] he's the same god come on yesterday
[51:40] today and forever
[51:42] but one thing you know
[51:44] one thing that all god asked for was
[51:46] obedience
[51:48] ain't it that's all he asked for he says
[51:51] now i want you to take that that word
[51:53] meditate in it day and night the book of
[51:55] the law he said i want you to be
[51:57] obedient so he says and if you walk in
[51:59] it come on and he gave them certain
[52:02] instructions as i was preaching on
[52:04] sunday the curse thing he gave them
[52:06] certain instructions when you go in the
[52:07] city come on the city is yours but
[52:09] there's certain things i don't want you
[52:10] to touch
[52:12] i want you to destroy because you bring
[52:14] it in it's going to be an occurs to you
[52:15] come on
[52:16] and we know what happened how i think it
[52:19] was in joshua chapter six you know how
[52:21] god
[52:22] was blessing them they were
[52:24] he as he was he was being come on going
[52:27] and giving them the land and all but you
[52:29] had one one person come on
[52:32] saul the the the babylonians garmin the
[52:35] silver and the spoil come on god
[52:37] blessing you all you got to do he said
[52:40] wherever you go i'm going to be with you
[52:41] i'ma get i don't give you the land why
[52:43] why you still got to covet those things
[52:45] why you still want to curse things come
[52:47] on
[52:48] but you know it got in my spirit how
[52:51] you know god began to tell joshua
[52:54] he when when they went out the ai
[52:56] because remember like i said you know
[52:59] they might have been smaller numbers but
[53:00] the difference was the supernatural
[53:03] but after when they went up the ai you
[53:05] know they went up to spy out the land
[53:08] began to say hey this it ain't but a few
[53:11] all of us don't need to go up this ain't
[53:12] nothing but a little test come on
[53:15] we can surely take take this city after
[53:18] all the great victories we don't won
[53:21] all the mountains we don't climb
[53:23] all the kings we don't destroy all the
[53:25] devils we don't fault right now surely
[53:28] this little test ain't nothing
[53:30] but the only difference was the glory
[53:32] was gone
[53:34] the only difference now come on is that
[53:36] the supernatural wasn't among them
[53:39] so when they went up they uh and they
[53:41] they fled the bible says their backs
[53:43] turned
[53:44] come on
[53:45] to the enemies
[53:47] fleeing
[53:48] running now from the enemy so joshua i
[53:51] can see him crying out to the lord lord
[53:53] you promise that you'll be with us
[53:56] what's wrong now lord come on and god
[53:58] began to tell joshua he says you know
[54:01] you need to get up he says i'm still not
[54:04] saying god he said but you got sin in
[54:06] the camp he said not only have israel
[54:09] touched the curse thing but they brought
[54:12] it in
[54:13] amongst their own stuff
[54:14] and he says until you deal with it
[54:17] hallelujah until you get it out he said
[54:19] i'll no longer be with you you'll flee
[54:22] before all your enemies didn't he say
[54:24] that
[54:25] until you deal with it hallelujah
[54:28] so sometimes i say we got to deal with
[54:31] situations come on
[54:33] you say god why is the well stopped up
[54:36] why is my blessings not flowing like
[54:38] they ought to be come on whoa is that a
[54:41] curse thing among you
[54:43] and it's something he says not only did
[54:45] they touch it but they brought it
[54:46] amongst their own stuff come on
[54:49] and i said that's always been a failure
[54:52] of the church come on
[54:54] always wanting to be like the world
[54:56] what the world do can do we can do too
[55:00] oh we can just get so close to it come
[55:02] on without going all the way
[55:04] come on but not so he says i made it i
[55:07] made a a separation between you and the
[55:09] world didn't he say that
[55:11] he said i don't want you to be like them
[55:13] when you go into the habits of the land
[55:15] he said i took the land from them
[55:17] because of the things they doing
[55:19] because of the lives they live in
[55:21] because of the sin in the camp
[55:23] so when you go in there don't do like
[55:24] them or i'll do you the same way i did
[55:26] them
[55:28] hallelujah
[55:29] so we find ourselves
[55:31] sometimes
[55:32] like i said at those crossroads come on
[55:35] i said lord just let me walk according
[55:37] to your word like i said i was praying
[55:39] lord you know me i said god you know me
[55:42] search my heart and try my reigns
[55:44] god don't let me covet the things of the
[55:46] world but let me get as far away from
[55:49] the world as i know how
[55:51] god don't let me covet bring the curse
[55:53] things in what's got my well stopped up
[55:56] what's got my blessings from flowing why
[55:58] are my back turned all my enemies god
[56:01] revealed this thing hallelujah
[56:04] so what happened he had to search it out
[56:07] didn't he
[56:08] search it out
[56:10] i said
[56:11] sharon on sunday i was saying search it
[56:13] out come on
[56:14] search out the camp
[56:16] hallelujah search out your own soul
[56:19] salvation with fear and trembling search
[56:22] it out
[56:23] hallelujah because it'll be a day when
[56:25] you need god you reach back for him and
[56:27] he might not be there
[56:29] come on
[56:30] hallelujah i said you know the thing is
[56:34] you know we can go there
[56:36] but i said the thing is you know
[56:37] sometimes we always
[56:39] feel a comfort like i was saying about
[56:41] samson he always knew that those locks
[56:44] were a covenant didn't he i said but the
[56:47] morning that he woke up to go out the
[56:50] face
[56:51] face the enemy god went with him and he
[56:53] didn't know i said if he would have
[56:54] thought once to reach back he would have
[56:56] felt that those locks wasn't there no
[56:58] more
[56:59] but he went out
[57:00] just
[57:01] just uh
[57:03] you know
[57:06] believing
[57:07] that god was still with him convinced
[57:08] that it was because so many times he
[57:11] went in and out
[57:12] and seems like the guard was still there
[57:15] but it was one time
[57:16] when he did that come on that god left
[57:19] him didn't they
[57:21] and then he was just as any other man
[57:24] but before that what was the difference
[57:25] the supernatural
[57:28] you know i said
[57:29] you know
[57:30] they began to search it out joshua began
[57:32] to search it out but one thing how you
[57:34] know look at how that stopped the well
[57:37] look at how that stopped as as just a
[57:39] couple chapters as you can read over as
[57:41] he says i'm gonna be with you making all
[57:43] these promises these blessings i'm gonna
[57:45] be with you i'm gonna be using all these
[57:46] things but then he said but now i want
[57:48] obedience from you come on he says but
[57:50] then you go right over here he said now
[57:52] i'll no longer be with you come on just
[57:54] like that god stopped
[57:56] stop the show i said god don't don't
[57:58] don't don't allow my well to be stopped
[58:00] up come on
[58:02] i don't want my will stopped up but i
[58:04] want to search it out how many want to
[58:05] search it out tonight
[58:07] so we fine i said he said as i was come
[58:09] on so shall i be
[58:11] you know i says tonight
[58:14] by the grace of god it might be
[58:16] 2021 almost 2022
[58:19] things is going on technology and all
[58:22] these things and people mind just seem
[58:24] to be getting further away from god in
[58:26] the supernatural why because everything
[58:28] is so accessible
[58:30] everything is so in a relaxed state come
[58:32] on you got so many other options
[58:34] but sometimes god let those options run
[58:37] out
[58:38] and put you in a corner i was sharing
[58:40] with someone uh yesterday i said we can
[58:43] always talk about somebody else trial
[58:46] and what they're going through and how
[58:47] you would have reacted i says but until
[58:49] you go and walk that walk that walk that
[58:51] they walked
[58:52] walking those shoes that they've been in
[58:54] then you can't speak on that situation
[58:56] come on
[58:57] but i do know one thing
[58:59] that no matter what comes your way god
[59:01] will put no more on you than you can
[59:02] bear now that's gonna be the truth
[59:04] anyhow hallelujah but what do we do we
[59:06] get on our knees and we pray for people
[59:09] all the time how many believe that
[59:10] tonight so i says you know as i was i
[59:13] don't i didn't want to be long i had a
[59:15] couple other things i said but but
[59:17] anyway as i was
[59:18] so shall i be
[59:20] come on
[59:22] i said as i was so shall i be
[59:25] with you
[59:26] as an individual do you believe that
[59:28] tonight
[59:30] i believe it amen
[59:32] [Applause]
[59:45] god is good amen
[59:48] god he's the same yesterday today in
[59:51] failure amen
[59:53] i was just reading today and thanking
[59:55] the lord for
[59:58] election
[1:00:00] because
[1:00:02] he said make your call in the election
[1:00:04] sure
[1:00:05] but i was thinking about
[1:00:08] the elect
[1:00:10] in your election
[1:00:13] and i thank god that he's
[1:00:15] given us
[1:00:16] his grace he chose us
[1:00:20] to be the elective god that means god
[1:00:23] chose you and i
[1:00:26] and not only
[1:00:27] did he choose us
[1:00:29] but
[1:00:30] by his grace he saved us
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:34] i was thanking the lord the prophet said
[1:00:37] he said he saved us by grace
[1:00:40] it's not what we've done it's what he's
[1:00:42] done for us
[1:00:45] and um
[1:00:46] the point is he says because of that
[1:00:51] works is what we do
[1:00:54] and grace is what he's done for us
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:00] he died shedded his blood he saved us
[1:01:04] grace is what he done for us
[1:01:07] and works is what we do out of
[1:01:09] appreciation for what he's done
[1:01:12] are you with me
[1:01:14] you know sometimes i don't think
[1:01:16] that we appreciate the grace of god
[1:01:20] in the election of god the elect
[1:01:22] you were chosen
[1:01:24] special
[1:01:26] amen
[1:01:27] and because of your god choosing you
[1:01:31] out of all the people of the earth
[1:01:34] god said you're special
[1:01:37] and he chose you
[1:01:39] and all
[1:01:40] in return we ought to appreciate
[1:01:45] we ought to love him and say thank you
[1:01:47] jesus every day
[1:01:49] of our lives we ought to dedicate our
[1:01:52] lives out of appreciation
[1:01:54] but you know folks
[1:01:57] they are not really
[1:01:59] understanding the grace of god towards
[1:02:03] them
[1:02:04] and that's why people have an attitude
[1:02:07] of they're not appreciative
[1:02:11] for what god has done for them
[1:02:14] they don't thank him and they don't see
[1:02:16] a need
[1:02:19] give god all the glory
[1:02:24] as we know as paul stated we're not
[1:02:27] sufficient of ourselves as to think
[1:02:29] anything of ourselves
[1:02:32] but our
[1:02:33] is of him
[1:02:35] it's because of him
[1:02:37] amen
[1:02:39] we don't have any strength any power in
[1:02:41] any might of our own
[1:02:43] he's about our sufficiencies of god
[1:02:47] it's because of his power that he keeps
[1:02:49] us
[1:02:51] amen
[1:02:52] it's because of his grace that he saved
[1:02:54] us
[1:02:56] and it's his grace that he's keeping us
[1:02:59] you know it don't don't take about a
[1:03:01] second for you to lose your mind
[1:03:04] boom
[1:03:05] it don't take about a second
[1:03:07] i remember the other night i was just
[1:03:09] laying in the bed
[1:03:11] and something just dropped
[1:03:13] on me
[1:03:14] i said god
[1:03:17] next thing i know
[1:03:19] that
[1:03:20] i was feeling so much pain in my chest
[1:03:24] because i i felt it don't take about a
[1:03:26] minute but
[1:03:28] something just
[1:03:29] drop on you
[1:03:30] and i knew what i was dealing with it
[1:03:31] was spirit
[1:03:33] see the devil can take you out at any
[1:03:35] time
[1:03:37] so i had to start fighting back in the
[1:03:39] spirit realm
[1:03:41] i had to start believing god
[1:03:44] and
[1:03:45] and the battle was on for some days
[1:03:49] until god little by little but i had to
[1:03:51] keep the faith
[1:03:53] because it don't take these things
[1:03:55] happen
[1:03:57] and
[1:03:59] all of a sudden you can lose everything
[1:04:03] rachel was talking about one of the
[1:04:04] students dying
[1:04:06] you know one of her students i mean one
[1:04:08] of the students
[1:04:10] from a couple of years ago died

[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:22] david come on up you got a testimony
[1:08:26] god bless brother david amen
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:39] so that i don't waste much time
[1:08:41] but i'm just going to a reference to
[1:08:43] what
[1:08:45] the minister preached today i know not
[1:08:47] many of you know who i am it doesn't
[1:08:49] really matter why you know who i am it
[1:08:51] doesn't matter what you know christ
[1:08:53] the reason why i'm coming out here
[1:08:55] because i want to let you know
[1:08:57] that i'm the living testimony for all
[1:09:00] what he has said
[1:09:02] today
[1:09:03] all through
[1:09:05] i've stepped my foot
[1:09:07] in this country
[1:09:09] all through my endeavors
[1:09:11] my education
[1:09:13] my jobs
[1:09:15] god has always seen me through
[1:09:18] he's always been there to bless me
[1:09:20] financially
[1:09:21] he has moved me from once
[1:09:23] one level to another level financially
[1:09:26] i've never gone back
[1:09:28] i reach a point right now
[1:09:30] that when i'm talking with god
[1:09:33] as i know him he said one thing to me
[1:09:37] this is what he said he said listen just
[1:09:39] as he
[1:09:40] watches me
[1:09:42] he knows who i am
[1:09:44] he knows my limits
[1:09:47] he doesn't need to anticipate whether i
[1:09:49] might fail him or i will not fail him
[1:09:52] that's the same way
[1:09:53] he wants me to know him
[1:09:55] to believe in his words to take his
[1:09:58] words that my strengths have been healed
[1:10:00] they provide all my all my knees
[1:10:02] conscious which is in glory
[1:10:05] that's when you start returning
[1:10:07] i was like when you could wake up like
[1:10:09] the critical song say i'm going back
[1:10:11] because i know my father
[1:10:13] i know who he is when those sons and
[1:10:16] daughters start waking up
[1:10:18] but i'm telling you not only on the
[1:10:19] financial part
[1:10:20] in terms of racism
[1:10:22] people who look at me say how can this
[1:10:25] guy be in charge of us
[1:10:27] he sounds different
[1:10:29] how does he know so much
[1:10:31] and how god
[1:10:32] just put them in their place for me
[1:10:34] without me even fighting
[1:10:36] you know i'm not trying to suck up to
[1:10:38] them
[1:10:39] because i know who is in charge on both
[1:10:40] sides there's god
[1:10:42] it has nothing to do with oh that guy's
[1:10:44] though he has all the money
[1:10:46] i know he's the lord
[1:10:47] he works on both sides
[1:10:49] and when you start to surrender
[1:10:52] he will always gonna be there for you
[1:10:54] and i pray that we can all come to that
[1:10:55] point you can get the last seed and we
[1:10:58] can get out of here
[1:11:00] amen
[1:11:08] praise god thank god for brother dave he
[1:11:10] don't say too much but we thank god for
[1:11:12] him his testimony amen
[1:11:16] um
[1:11:17] we want to like i said we want to
[1:11:19] continue to pray for
[1:11:21] jason and the church there and beaufort

[1:13:17] you got to have that quickening power
[1:13:21] that raptured power you got to have it
[1:13:25] amen there ain't no doubt about it
[1:13:29] you've got to have the quickening power
[1:13:32] each and every one of us that you expect
[1:13:34] to be raptured you're gonna have to have
[1:13:36] the quickened power

[1:13:44] have to have it and i said a church
