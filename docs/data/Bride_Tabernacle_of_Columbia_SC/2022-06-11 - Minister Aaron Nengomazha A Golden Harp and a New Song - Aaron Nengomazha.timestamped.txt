[34:20] these days people don't want to come to
[34:21] church
[34:22] they want to have their food delivered
[34:24] they want to have
[34:25] things come through amazon but with god
[34:28] it doesn't work like that

[34:35] a blessing in coming to church
[34:38] praise the lord
[34:39] if you take an egg if you put it under a
[34:41] pup it will hatch
[34:43] why it takes the atmosphere when you

[34:47] right atmosphere and by obeying the word
[34:50] of god there is a blessing that comes
[34:52] with that

[35:38] a pilgrim in the spirit in the pilgrim
[35:40] in the flesh
[35:42] just coming over to the united states of
[35:43] america
[35:45] but uh there's no place
[35:47] that we can call our home our home is
[35:49] above
[35:50] whether i'm in africa in australia in
[35:52] america
[35:53] that's just a place to drop but our home
[35:56] is above praise god
[35:59] so if we can
[36:01] stand and
[36:02] get read a portion of the word tonight
[36:05] being that this is a midweek service we
[36:07] don't intend to take a lot of time
[36:09] out be you know ministering for a few
[36:11] minutes and then we will be ready to go
[36:14] back home
[36:15] if you come to church on sunday
[36:17] you're a conqueror if you come on friday
[36:19] evening you are more than conqueror
[36:23] praise god revelations chapter 15 verse
[36:27] 1
[36:29] revelation chapter 15 verse 1. i love
[36:31] the book of revelations
[36:33] the bible says and i saw another sign in
[36:36] heaven
[36:37] great and marvelous seven angels having
[36:40] the seven last plagues
[36:42] for in them is filled up the wrath of
[36:44] god
[36:45] and i saw as it were the sea of glass
[36:49] mingled with fire and them that had
[36:51] gotten victory over the beast and over
[36:54] his name and over his mark and over the
[36:56] number of his name
[36:58] stand on the sea of glass having the
[37:00] hops of god
[37:02] they sang the song of moses the servant
[37:04] of god and the song of the lamb saying
[37:07] great and marvelous are thy works lord
[37:10] god almighty just and true are thy ways
[37:13] thou king of saints
[37:15] praise be to god you may take your seeds
[37:21] we can also read back in revelation
[37:23] chapter 14 verse 3 the bible says
[37:26] and they sang as it were a new song
[37:29] before the throne
[37:30] and before the four beasts and the
[37:32] elders and no man could lend that song
[37:36] but the 144 000 which were redeemed from
[37:39] the earth
[37:40] praise god
[37:41] so this was a song of the redeemed
[37:44] so today we want to talk about a golden
[37:47] half and a new song
[37:49] praise god
[37:50] so these ones were redeemed by god
[37:54] and because they had victory
[37:56] they were singing a new song
[37:59] every victory
[38:01] a new song comes out of every victory
[38:03] praise god
[38:05] there is no song that comes without
[38:08] some form of experience
[38:11] all the wonderful songs that we have
[38:13] they came through a revival
[38:15] most of them were written during the
[38:17] time of the revival
[38:19] because when god gives the victory
[38:21] that's when people sing a new song
[38:24] and i want you to understand from the
[38:26] scriptures that we'll read tonight that
[38:28] it's not only these 144 000
[38:31] that are supposed to sing a new song
[38:34] you and me
[38:35] by believing the bible by be receiving
[38:38] jesus christ in our life
[38:40] and getting victory over the world we
[38:43] ought to sing a new song
[38:45] the fact that we can wake up in the
[38:47] morning and we know that jesus christ is
[38:49] our savior that ought to give us a new
[38:52] song
[38:52] but the devil does not want us to sing a
[38:55] new song
[38:56] the devil wants us to complain the devil
[38:58] wants us to maim her the devil wants us
[39:00] to look at what we don't have he does
[39:02] not want us to praise god for what we
[39:05] have but i want to tell you tonight
[39:07] there is a song that you can sing and
[39:10] god wants to hear that song
[39:13] in the beginning was god
[39:15] and the word is elohim
[39:17] the self-existing one and he had
[39:20] attributes in him and he wanted to be
[39:22] worshiped
[39:23] god wanted to be praised why did god
[39:27] choose to redeem men
[39:28] so that they can be to the brit to the
[39:31] praise of his own glory
[39:33] god redeemed us so that we can sing in
[39:36] praise
[39:37] god heals us so that we can give him
[39:39] praise
[39:41] hallelujah
[39:42] david said i will not die
[39:44] but i will leave to declare the works of
[39:47] god
[39:47] i will not die but i will leave to sing
[39:50] the song of the redeemed
[39:52] praise be to god
[39:54] when you have victory over alcohol you
[39:57] ought to sing a new song when you have
[39:59] victory over cocaine you ought to sing a
[40:02] new song when you have victory over
[40:04] yourself you ought to sing the song of
[40:06] the lamb
[40:08] hallelujah why were the children of
[40:10] israel consumed in the wilderness
[40:13] because they were complaining they were
[40:15] looking at their it's their self they're
[40:18] looking at their inabilities but i want
[40:21] their abilities but i want to tell you
[40:22] tonight
[40:23] god is not interested in your abilities
[40:26] god wants you to look at what he can do
[40:29] for you
[40:30] god wants you to look at the cross of
[40:32] calvary and when you look at the cross
[40:34] of calvary then you can sing a new song
[40:38] and you say we crown you with many
[40:39] crowns
[40:41] high and lifted up
[40:43] where thing is the lamp
[40:44] that's what the songs of the redeemed
[40:46] that's the song that they were singing
[40:48] right here where things the lord's got
[40:50] almighty who is who was and who shall
[40:53] come
[40:54] hallelujah
[40:55] they overcame the beast they overcame
[40:58] his name they overcame his power but
[41:01] they realized it wasn't in them it was
[41:04] in the lamp
[41:05] if we are ever to come out of this age
[41:08] it's not going to be our works it has to
[41:10] be the works of god it has to be what
[41:12] jesus christ did for us recovery
[41:15] you see folks that say i don't want to
[41:17] come to church i will come to church
[41:18] once i quit doing this you will never
[41:20] quit doing that
[41:22] you have to come to church in your
[41:24] condition
[41:25] you have to come to church with your
[41:26] situation
[41:27] because when you come to church with
[41:29] your situation you are saying lord i've
[41:32] got this situation but i am trusting you
[41:35] but you if you say i'm going to stop
[41:37] doing this and come to church what
[41:38] you're telling god is that i will sort
[41:40] out my problems then i can worship you
[41:43] you cannot worship god unless you are
[41:45] redeemed
[41:46] [Music]
[41:47] let's read a scripture here the bible
[41:48] says in exodus
[41:50] chapter 3 verse 12
[41:54] and he said certainly i will be with
[41:56] thee
[41:57] and this shall be a talking unto thee
[41:59] that i have sent thee when thou has
[42:01] brought forth the people out of egypt
[42:04] you shall save god upon this mountain
[42:07] so god was telling moses that the sign
[42:10] that i've sent you
[42:12] is that when you bring them out of egypt
[42:15] you shall worship god on this mountain
[42:18] praise god what did god say and to
[42:21] unto moses he said say unto pharaoh let
[42:24] my people go that they may worship me
[42:27] hallelujah how many knows that
[42:29] redemption is in two parts
[42:31] the word church it means cold out of
[42:35] so god called the vine out of egypt
[42:38] and he brought them into israel so that
[42:41] they can worship god
[42:43] he says
[42:44] pharaoh let my people go that they may
[42:47] come and worship me
[42:48] in other words you cannot worship god in
[42:51] bondage you cannot worship god in the
[42:54] world you have to come out of the word
[42:56] by the preaching of the gospel and
[42:58] that's when you can worship god
[43:01] you cannot serve two masters either you
[43:03] will love one or despise the other
[43:05] praise be to god
[43:07] you cannot have two husbands one has to
[43:09] die before you can live with other
[43:11] that's a bible principle praise god
[43:15] so when when god takes you from egypt
[43:18] and he redeems you from slavery and then
[43:21] he takes you to the promised land
[43:23] then you can sing the song of the
[43:25] redeemed
[43:27] hallelujah the bible says let the
[43:29] redeemer the
[43:30] the redeemed of the lord say so
[43:33] why don't we have a shout to do these
[43:36] days why don't we have praise these days
[43:38] it's because people have you know
[43:40] salvation they've lost the joy of
[43:42] salvation
[43:44] you can lose you can never lose your
[43:45] salvation but you can lose the joy of
[43:48] your salvation that's why david says in
[43:50] psalm chapter 51
[43:52] respond unto me the joy of my salvation
[43:56] and give me a right spirit
[43:59] hallelujah because without the joy of
[44:01] salvation you cannot serve god perfectly
[44:07] we'll be dragging you to church oh today
[44:09] is friday service let's just go
[44:11] to the sunday service why can't we
[44:13] stream you know the joy of salvation has
[44:15] been lost
[44:17] and god has to come back and restore
[44:19] that joy to
[44:21] that joy of salvation it's like when you
[44:23] you know first hearing marriage or you
[44:25] know when you fall in love
[44:27] there's josh you can't wait to be with
[44:30] each other you can't wait to see each
[44:31] other you want to talk to each other
[44:33] when once that joy is lost then the
[44:36] marriage is no longer sweet
[44:38] but once that joy is in the home then
[44:40] you have a wonderful marriage that's the
[44:43] same thing with jesus christ
[44:45] we want we have to have the joy of
[44:47] salvation
[44:49] that's the joy that makes us sing with
[44:51] all our hearts that's the joy that makes
[44:53] us testify to our neighbors the reason
[44:56] why you are afraid to tell your
[44:58] neighbour about jesus christ is because
[45:00] you have lost the joy of
[45:02] salvation people in the world are
[45:04] corrupt
[45:06] and they are not afraid to tell you know
[45:08] people who they are what they are
[45:11] some are these days you know they say i
[45:13] am lgbtq and different things they are
[45:15] not ashamed that's what they want that's
[45:17] what they've chose
[45:19] but you being choosing to become a
[45:21] christian amen it ought to be the most
[45:24] beautiful thing that you are ready to
[45:26] tell everyone out there
[45:28] praise god
[45:29] but that joy has been lost in this
[45:32] generation
[45:33] i see young people that's why you see
[45:35] because if you have the joy of salvation
[45:37] then the the things of this world will
[45:40] not matter to you
[45:41] but if you lose the joy of salvation you
[45:43] will try to find joy somewhere and the
[45:46] joy of salvation is not something that a
[45:48] pastor can give you
[45:50] it's not something that your parents can
[45:52] give you it's something that the holy
[45:54] spirit has to give you
[45:56] inside your heart
[45:58] you can say well i've been i've been in
[46:00] the i've been in church for all my life
[46:02] i've been in the message for 10 years
[46:04] that means nothing
[46:06] if you have lost the joy of salvation
[46:09] if you have lost the joy of salvation
[46:10] you're as good as someone who is out
[46:13] there
[46:14] hallelujah
[46:15] we have got a lot of folks that are
[46:17] sitting in the bench but they have lost
[46:19] the joy of salvation but tonight we want
[46:21] god to help us so that we can go back to
[46:23] the song of the redeemed so that we can
[46:25] have the same spirit that these brothers
[46:28] said when they say amazing grace how
[46:31] sweet the sound
[46:33] praise be to god
[46:35] we ought to be a people that are on fire
[46:37] for god
[46:38] because we are living in a very very
[46:40] evil generation
[46:42] we are living we are coming we have come
[46:44] in a junction
[46:46] time is blending into eternity
[46:49] many accidents happen at a junction
[46:52] that's what they say
[46:53] because you have to choose we're in a
[46:55] crossroads
[46:56] you know it's like a young man who's you
[46:58] know
[46:58] going into marriage he's a junction and
[47:01] the devil will be waiting all his life
[47:02] to wait for that young man when it comes
[47:04] to that junction
[47:06] that young lady looking for a young man
[47:08] to get married to it's a junction so we
[47:11] have beca we have come at a junction in
[47:13] this end time and the prophet of god
[47:15] says at every junction god sends an
[47:18] angel
[47:20] hallelujah
[47:21] praise be to god
[47:22] some chapter 137 verse one the bible
[47:26] says
[47:26] by the rivers of babylon
[47:28] there we sat down here we wept when we
[47:31] remembered zion
[47:34] we hanged our hops upon the wheels in
[47:37] the midst thereof
[47:39] for they they they that carried us away
[47:42] captive required us a song
[47:44] and they that wasted us require us for a
[47:48] myth saying sing unto us of the songs of
[47:51] zion
[47:52] how shall we sing the songs of zion in a
[47:55] strange land
[47:56] in other words if we are in babylon we
[47:59] cannot sing the songs of zion
[48:01] we cannot you cannot sing a new song
[48:04] when you are in babylon and babylon
[48:06] means confusion
[48:08] and we have got three babylons in the
[48:10] bible we have the first babylon of
[48:12] nimrod which was called the tower of
[48:13] babel
[48:14] and we have the babylon in the midst of
[48:16] the bible in the book of of daniel which
[48:19] was the babylon of nebuchadnezzar and we
[48:22] have the last babylon which we are right
[48:24] now in the book of revelations which is
[48:26] called mystery babylon
[48:28] but it's the same spirit a spirit of
[48:31] confusion
[48:32] babylon means confusion where people
[48:35] don't know whether they are men or they
[48:37] are women people don't know whether you
[48:39] are a father or a boss it's a spirit of
[48:42] confusion
[48:43] but the bible says that it shall be
[48:46] light in the evening time and the path
[48:48] of glory shall surely find
[48:50] praise be to god
[48:51] and the bible is they that escaped out
[48:54] of babylon and we are here tonight the
[48:57] redeemed of the lord being redeemed from
[49:00] babylon being redeemed from confusion
[49:02] bringing redeemed from denominationalism
[49:05] being redeemed from religion to a
[49:07] relationship with jesus christ
[49:10] from the law to revelation
[49:13] from legislation to revelation you don't
[49:16] need anyone to tell you you ought to
[49:18] wear something modest you don't need
[49:20] anyone to tell you you don't have to go
[49:22] to this place the holy spirit is living
[49:25] in you will tell you i'm not going to
[49:27] wear this i'm not i'm not going to go
[49:29] there the bible says i will take away
[49:31] the stone heart
[49:32] oh glory to god and i will give you the
[49:35] heart of flesh
[49:37] and i will give you a new spirit
[49:40] hallelujah and then i will put my spirit
[49:43] within you
[49:45] just having a new spirit my precious
[49:47] brother you don't speak bread about your
[49:49] neighbor by just having a new spirit not
[49:52] the holy spirit a new spirit
[49:54] the new spirit will tell you i can't say
[49:56] something bad about my pastor and your
[49:59] spirit will tell you i have to go to
[50:00] church
[50:01] i have to i have to pay my tithe
[50:03] that just requires a new spirit the holy
[50:06] ghost is too harsh
[50:08] just a new spirit for you to have the
[50:10] basics
[50:12] hallelujah
[50:13] so these were in babylon
[50:15] and they were told to sing the songs of
[50:17] the redeemed
[50:19] and they cried he said lord
[50:21] how can we sing the songs of the
[50:22] redeemed when we are in a strange land
[50:25] you can you can unless you are born
[50:27] again you cannot see the kingdom of god
[50:30] unless you are born again the songs of
[50:32] amazing grace they mean nothing to you
[50:35] unless you are born again the bible
[50:36] means nothing to you unless you are born
[50:39] again church means nothing to you but
[50:41] when you are born again
[50:44] then you can sing the songs of the
[50:45] redeemed
[50:46] then you can cry with tears in your eyes
[50:49] son when i save your calls i will answer
[50:52] when they call for my name i will share
[50:55] from heaven
[50:56] hallelujah wash because you have been
[50:59] redeemed
[51:00] praise be to god
[51:03] hallelujah
[51:05] praise be to god
[51:06] psalms chapter 40 verse 1 the bible says
[51:09] i waited patiently for the lord
[51:12] stop
[51:14] i waited presciently for the lord
[51:16] something that we don't have in this
[51:18] urge
[51:19] we are used to having things fast
[51:21] it has to be on the app fast you know
[51:23] you order it it comes everything has to
[51:25] be fast
[51:26] 5g
[51:27] with god things don't work like that
[51:30] god follows his own clock
[51:33] and it's not like a domino's clock
[51:37] it's not like chick-fil-a clock
[51:39] it's god's clock
[51:41] you have to work by god's clock if god
[51:43] says wait you wait
[51:46] hallelujah
[51:47] i waited patiently for the lord and he
[51:50] inclined unto me and hurt my cry
[51:53] i love that god hears our cry god sees
[51:56] our tears god knows our burdens he's a
[52:00] high priest that can be touched by the
[52:02] feelings of our infirmities
[52:05] hallelujah
[52:06] he brought me also out of the horrible
[52:08] peace
[52:10] praise god
[52:11] how many can testify
[52:13] he brought me from the horrible peace do
[52:16] you know where you came from do you know
[52:18] what you wear and you know what you are
[52:20] tonight
[52:21] it's god that took you from the horrible
[52:24] peace
[52:26] praise be to god
[52:27] once i was lost
[52:29] but now i'm found
[52:31] thank god i'm free thank god i'm fear
[52:34] praise be the gods
[52:38] praise be to god
[52:40] it reminds me of the old negro song
[52:42] free at last fear at last thank god and
[52:45] free at last
[52:48] i hope that's politically correct
[52:50] americans they are very sensitive
[52:54] no you can't say that
[52:55] hey brother in africa we are free
[52:58] we can say whatever we can do whatever
[53:01] praise god
[53:03] but in america you have to be very
[53:05] careful
[53:07] you know out of the mirror clay and set
[53:09] my feet upon the rock
[53:11] and established my goings and he has put
[53:14] a new song in my mouth
[53:17] god has to give you a new song
[53:20] how many remember the testimony of
[53:22] george carter who when when god healed
[53:25] her she stood up and she went on the
[53:27] piano and she started playing there is a
[53:29] fountain and the prophet says she
[53:31] blessed the grass
[53:32] she went on to bless the flowers why
[53:35] because god had healed her after
[53:38] redemption the next thing that comes is
[53:41] just wait until we get in the rapture
[53:44] you will want to have time to talk to
[53:46] one another who will be singing the
[53:48] songs of redemption and the angels won't
[53:50] be able to join the song because they
[53:53] have never been lost
[53:54] but we can worship god
[53:57] in a perfect way because we were once
[54:00] lost and we are fought
[54:03] hallelujah
[54:05] psalms 137 i think i've read this one
[54:08] the bible says in exodus chapter 3
[54:12] 30 verse 13 and every firstling of an
[54:15] ass thou shall redeem with the lamp
[54:17] and if thou shalt not redeem it then
[54:19] thou shalt break his neck
[54:21] and all the firstborn of of uh
[54:24] among the children thou shalt redeem
[54:27] so the donkey was redeemed by a lamp
[54:30] now a donkey
[54:32] being redeemed by a lamp
[54:34] i was that donkey useless something that
[54:37] you know is of no virtue
[54:40] but because there was a lamp
[54:43] a donkey could be redeemed
[54:46] because there was a lamp
[54:47] a drunkard could be redeemed
[54:50] because there was a lamp and an
[54:52] adjective could be redeemed
[54:55] because of the power of the lamp
[54:57] hallelujah i want us to read a scripture
[55:00] let me find here it's in ezekiel chapter
[55:03] 18 verse 1 to 3.
[55:06] ezekiel chapter 18 verse 103 if we have
[55:09] our bibles
[55:11] the bible says
[55:12] and the word of the lord came unto me
[55:15] again saying
[55:16] what do you mean ye that he used this
[55:19] proverbs concerning the land of israel
[55:22] saying the father have eaten sour grapes
[55:26] and the children's teeth are set on edge
[55:29] as i live said the lord you shall not
[55:31] have occasion anymore to use this
[55:34] proverb in israel
[55:36] so they were singing a song right
[55:38] the father's
[55:40] their father's eight sour grabs
[55:42] and the children's teeth are set on age
[55:45] and god heard it and i want to say
[55:47] tonight that god hears everything that
[55:49] we say
[55:51] the conversations that we have with our
[55:53] children on the kitchen table god he is
[55:55] that
[55:56] the things that we speak in silence god
[55:58] hears that
[56:00] god hears our thoughts so these were in
[56:02] babylon and they were they were saying
[56:05] these proverbs because you know what
[56:07] these were children that were born in
[56:08] babylon
[56:09] so they were saying you our father
[56:12] sinned
[56:13] and god sent them in babylon right
[56:16] and these children were born in babylon
[56:18] and they were saying you know what we
[56:19] are suffering for something that we
[56:20] don't know nothing about
[56:22] it's not us that saint it's our fathers
[56:24] that sins and they were carried away
[56:26] into slavery and we are here born in
[56:29] slavery
[56:30] and we are suffering for something that
[56:32] we didn't do
[56:33] so they came up with this proverb and
[56:35] they were saying the fathers hate sour
[56:38] grapes but the children's teeth are the
[56:40] ones that are set on age
[56:42] and god read that proverb
[56:44] and he didn't like it
[56:46] and he said you shall not use that
[56:49] prophet
[56:50] praise god
[56:52] because
[56:54] we are born
[56:55] under sin through adam in other words
[56:58] our condemnation came by representation
[57:02] whether you you did not choose to be
[57:04] born the way you were born it was
[57:06] because of what adam did
[57:08] some of us were in the inner
[57:10] circumstances of what that we are not
[57:13] because of our choice but because of the
[57:15] way we were born because of the families
[57:17] we were born unto because of the way we
[57:19] came amen but
[57:21] that's not where you stop amen god said
[57:25] to ezekiel you shall not use that
[57:27] proverb and if you read down god said
[57:31] if a man
[57:32] shall
[57:33] turn away from his sins
[57:35] and ask for forgiveness the bible says
[57:38] god says i will not take the the sins of
[57:41] his of the father upon him
[57:43] in other words the same way you are
[57:45] condemned by representation through adam
[57:48] is the same way you are justified by
[57:50] representation through jesus christ
[57:54] hallelujah
[57:55] so you don't have to do anything
[57:58] you found yourself in this situation
[58:00] you were born in a family that had many
[58:03] problems you were born in a family some
[58:05] say my family had many demons
[58:08] but i want to tell you something
[58:10] your current circumstance does not mean
[58:12] nothing
[58:14] the only thing you have to do is to
[58:15] trust god
[58:17] if we look at abraham he was he was he
[58:19] was born in babylon he was worshiping
[58:20] idols he could have said hey you know
[58:22] what i can't help myself
[58:24] look at my records look at my the way i
[58:27] was raised up because we are living in a
[58:29] time where you know there is a lot of
[58:32] victim mentality right but when it comes
[58:35] when it comes to the word
[58:37] you don't have to have that
[58:40] you have to trust god
[58:41] in your own circumstances
[58:44] why i'm saying so is because sometimes
[58:46] you know we put a lot on ourselves on
[58:48] our past he said he said brother aaron
[58:51] if only i didn't have this criminal
[58:52] record i could have a good i could have
[58:54] a good job
[58:55] god is not looking at that tonight
[58:57] i believe that god can work miracles you
[59:00] just have to trust god
[59:02] praise be to god
[59:04] my parents didn't go to school
[59:07] my parents didn't go to school they
[59:08] can't even read english i mean
[59:12] but
[59:13] i trusted in the lord
[59:15] and i've always trusted in the lord i'm
[59:18] here in america i don't have my family i
[59:20] only have my wife and you know you folks
[59:22] here but i'm trusting god
[59:24] i've lived in a country where inflation
[59:26] has gone thousand percent i mean we
[59:29] broke all kinds of records in
[59:31] zimbabwe when it comes to inflection so
[59:34] right now i'm at a point where nothing
[59:35] moves me
[59:36] if inflation is five percent
[59:39] it doesn't move me i'm i'm way past
[59:42] that
[59:43] hallelujah
[59:45] you talk about gas price
[59:47] this is nothing that should say
[59:49] people in america be like whoa the lord
[59:51] is coming look at the prices
[59:54] the lord has always been falling apart
[59:56] you're just starting to see it right
[59:59] you travel around ask brother simons you
[1:00:01] travel around where you go to some
[1:00:03] places they don't even have clean
[1:00:05] drinking water man but here people are
[1:00:07] mad because someone took their parking
[1:00:09] spots
[1:00:10] you know someone would be mad just
[1:00:11] because someone you know someone sit at
[1:00:13] my pew
[1:00:15] it's because we don't know what life is
[1:00:18] if if we had known you'll just be
[1:00:20] praising god for what you have
[1:00:22] praise me to god
[1:00:24] praise be to god
[1:00:26] you ought to thank god for what you have
[1:00:29] praise be to god amen
[1:00:32] but people think the lord that they're
[1:00:33] americans i thank god i'm an american
[1:00:37] you ought to thank the lord that you are
[1:00:38] a son of god amen
[1:00:41] so god was saying don't you sing that
[1:00:44] broken song
[1:00:46] to say you know what you know because
[1:00:48] sometimes people try to these are the
[1:00:49] people that begs like they want to find
[1:00:51] food with god
[1:00:53] the first sign of backsliding is finding
[1:00:55] fault with god
[1:00:57] that's what cain did
[1:00:59] lord what am i supposed to do my
[1:01:00] punishment is too great for me
[1:01:03] if it sounds like you you judge god to
[1:01:05] say god you're unfair but let me tell
[1:01:08] you something god is just
[1:01:10] god is fair
[1:01:12] god knows exactly what we are supposed
[1:01:15] to be where we are supposed to be what
[1:01:17] we're supposed to be amen
[1:01:18] i've seen sometimes people you know god
[1:01:20] just blesses them a little bit they buy
[1:01:22] a nice car i would listen to some
[1:01:25] testimonies the brother said you know
[1:01:26] what i was a very good boy until i
[1:01:28] started working i mean i bought a
[1:01:29] mustang that's when i basically i left
[1:01:32] god
[1:01:33] so you come to find out that god knows
[1:01:35] that if i give this person this thing
[1:01:37] i'll lose them
[1:01:39] so if you look at everything put
[1:01:41] together you see that god knows exactly
[1:01:43] what he's doing
[1:01:44] and god is just
[1:01:47] and you cannot judge god by what you see
[1:01:49] on the natural anybody you might see me
[1:01:52] say brother aaron is driving a very nice
[1:01:54] car but you don't know some disease that
[1:01:57] i'm battling every day
[1:01:58] right you don't know how many months the
[1:02:00] doctors have given me to leave
[1:02:02] if i if we exchange our problems you say
[1:02:05] you know what i'd rather have my
[1:02:06] problems
[1:02:07] so at the end of the day god knows
[1:02:10] exactly what he's doing
[1:02:12] you have to trust and thank the lord
[1:02:15] with whatever you have
[1:02:17] and you ought to worship and praise god
[1:02:20] you don't just praise god when you come
[1:02:21] to church you praise god every day
[1:02:24] you praise god in the morning you praise
[1:02:26] god in the afternoon you praise god in
[1:02:28] the evening
[1:02:30] but we have come to an age where the
[1:02:32] bible says that people shall be
[1:02:33] ungrateful
[1:02:35] people are angry and always
[1:02:38] angry
[1:02:39] i can't blame them because of what
[1:02:41] they're saying on the internet
[1:02:43] what they are seeing on the news
[1:02:45] and nobody is reading what this press is
[1:02:47] saying
[1:02:48] if you wake up in the morning you read
[1:02:50] what this person is saying you'll be in
[1:02:51] a good mood
[1:02:53] before you go to sleep at night
[1:02:55] don't go to cnn or foxes
[1:02:58] what does the bible say
[1:03:00] what does god say about my gas prices
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:04] hallelujah
[1:03:05] you will find that god will say how i
[1:03:07] will provide
[1:03:09] and they say praise god god will provide
[1:03:12] how can you see miracles unless you come
[1:03:14] through difficult situations
[1:03:16] it takes difficult situations to come up
[1:03:18] with testimonies
[1:03:21] situations like this i like them because
[1:03:23] that's when people start to say brother
[1:03:24] aaron i want to thank the lord you know
[1:03:26] i was praying i didn't have money for
[1:03:28] gas and gods of light and i start to see
[1:03:30] god moving among his people
[1:03:33] you see we are living in a time where
[1:03:36] men's hearts have become so calloused
[1:03:38] amen after covet i thought people are
[1:03:41] gonna come back to church fill up the
[1:03:43] churches but people got worse
[1:03:46] they actually got worse
[1:03:47] i think we're in a time where nothing
[1:03:49] can move people right now even if russia
[1:03:52] destroys the whole europe people still
[1:03:55] not come to church
[1:03:56] but you and i are not part of that group
[1:03:58] amen we are part of the redeemed
[1:04:02] praise be to god
[1:04:03] let me rush now i'm about to close in a
[1:04:06] few here
[1:04:09] so
[1:04:10] we find out that here is what the
[1:04:12] prophet says now to you that say it's
[1:04:14] wrong for you to be represented by adam
[1:04:16] as a sinner what about through
[1:04:18] representation we have salvation also
[1:04:20] you can no more save yourself than you
[1:04:23] could take your boots traps and jump
[1:04:25] over to the moon with it you can no more
[1:04:27] you're boring seen your your renegade to
[1:04:29] start with every one of us and we could
[1:04:31] not help ourselves and how we ever going
[1:04:34] to be saved one come
[1:04:37] one come to represent us so jesus christ
[1:04:40] came to save us so that we can be to the
[1:04:43] praise of his glory let's read ephesians
[1:04:46] chapter
[1:04:48] chapter 1
[1:04:50] verse 1
[1:04:52] the bible says
[1:04:57] verse four according as he have chosen
[1:04:59] us in him
[1:05:01] before the foundation of the world that
[1:05:03] we should be holy and without blame
[1:05:06] before him in life
[1:05:08] having predestinated us unto adoption of
[1:05:11] children by jesus christ
[1:05:14] so here the bible says that he he
[1:05:15] predestinated us to come to adoption
[1:05:19] you can say you know what i'm
[1:05:20] predestined i can do whatever i want i'm
[1:05:22] predestinated i cannot be lost i can
[1:05:24] just go back in the world that shows
[1:05:26] that you are not predestinated because
[1:05:28] the scripture here is that we are
[1:05:30] predestinated to come to adoption amen
[1:05:33] in other words we are we are there is a
[1:05:35] power of transformation that changes us
[1:05:38] until we become like jesus
[1:05:41] and we are adopted in shame
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] the adoption of of jesus christ to
[1:05:48] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:05:50] of his will amen verse 6 to the praise
[1:05:54] of the glory of his grace
[1:05:57] wherewith he has accepted us in the
[1:06:00] beloved so we are praised to come to the
[1:06:02] praise of the glory of his grace
[1:06:05] so we was we are saved and redeemed and
[1:06:08] predestinated
[1:06:09] so that we can be to the praise of his
[1:06:12] own grace amen we have to praise god
[1:06:15] with a song of peace amen
[1:06:18] when they used to go to war
[1:06:20] one time they asked god through a
[1:06:22] prophet lord what shall we do and god
[1:06:24] says judah must go first how many knows
[1:06:26] that whenever they went to bedrock judah
[1:06:29] went first and what does judah mean mean
[1:06:31] judah means praise
[1:06:33] the praises of god has to go for us and
[1:06:35] the blessings will come down
[1:06:37] but today we don't come to church with
[1:06:39] praise what does the bible say in the
[1:06:41] book of psalms
[1:06:43] enter in his case within thanksgiving in
[1:06:45] praise
[1:06:46] what does the singer say i will enter
[1:06:48] his gates with thanksgiving in my heart
[1:06:50] i will enter his courts with praise
[1:06:53] that's the approach to god
[1:06:55] there's a way to approach the
[1:06:58] the queen of england there's a protocol
[1:07:00] there's a way to approach anything in
[1:07:02] life and the way to approach god is to
[1:07:04] praise amen
[1:07:06] hallelujah juja means praise
[1:07:09] that's why if you read guinness
[1:07:10] beginners when jacob was blessing the
[1:07:12] tribes he said children my son thou art
[1:07:15] a lion squad
[1:07:17] you are a son of a lion and because he
[1:07:19] was a son of a lion he was a king
[1:07:22] and the bible says well because you are
[1:07:24] an old lion who shall arouse you you are
[1:07:27] fearless because you praise god
[1:07:29] you are jews you praise god when you
[1:07:32] when you don't have shoes you praise god
[1:07:34] when you have got a meal you praise god
[1:07:36] when you have a house you praise god in
[1:07:38] apartments you praise the lord anyhow
[1:07:42] when you are in the hospital you praise
[1:07:44] god
[1:07:46] poor and silence when they were in the
[1:07:47] prison chains
[1:07:49] hallelujah they did not look at their
[1:07:52] chains they did not remember they did
[1:07:54] not say oh if only jesus christ was here
[1:07:57] they begin to praise they begin to
[1:07:59] praise god and when they were praising
[1:08:01] god their chains were broken
[1:08:04] because they were singing the song of
[1:08:06] redemption
[1:08:08] they were singing the song of the
[1:08:09] redeemed amen
[1:08:11] but today we have got artificial praise
[1:08:13] people only come to a concert they sing
[1:08:15] these beautiful songs but every day they
[1:08:17] live all kinds of life you have to
[1:08:19] praise god every day amen and you have
[1:08:22] to worship god with your eyes
[1:08:24] the bible says worship god in the beauty
[1:08:27] of his holiness
[1:08:29] when you live a concentrated life you
[1:08:31] are worshiping god
[1:08:33] because god does not dwell with being
[1:08:36] buildings the monster dwells in
[1:08:39] tabernacles in the house of man amen
[1:08:41] hallelujah that's why god loves judah
[1:08:45] that's why god loved david amen david
[1:08:48] was the only one that could slay goliath
[1:08:50] because it took a bit of praise
[1:08:53] to move such a situation
[1:08:55] if you read revelation chapter chapter
[1:08:57] five
[1:08:58] the bible says that
[1:09:01] the 24 elders the angels they all cast
[1:09:04] down their crowns then they were
[1:09:06] praising god
[1:09:08] because the lamb was worth to take the
[1:09:10] book
[1:09:11] and to redeem man
[1:09:13] they were worshiping god
[1:09:15] but today we have got people who are
[1:09:17] complaining
[1:09:18] only if the government can do this for
[1:09:20] us let me tell you this
[1:09:21] politicians will not do anything for you
[1:09:24] amen politicians will never change your
[1:09:26] life amen but god can change your life
[1:09:30] hallelujah how many knows that amen we
[1:09:33] ought to praise god in our hearts we
[1:09:35] ought to praise god every day of our
[1:09:37] lives we think we praise god for your
[1:09:39] children you bring them to church it
[1:09:41] shows that you are thankful to god
[1:09:43] but if you have children and you want to
[1:09:45] bring them to church it means that you
[1:09:46] are ungrateful because praising god it's
[1:09:49] not lip service
[1:09:51] it's a life amen because the bible says
[1:09:54] that
[1:09:55] they worship me with their lips but
[1:09:57] their hearts are far from me amen so
[1:09:59] true worship and praise comes from the
[1:10:01] heart
[1:10:03] that's what god wants
[1:10:04] praise god amen my time is up but i want
[1:10:07] to say this to you church
[1:10:10] let's sing
[1:10:11] a song of praise to him amen let's sing
[1:10:14] the song after the team to share if
[1:10:16] there was a time that the light has
[1:10:18] shined so bright it's in this time that
[1:10:20] we're living it
[1:10:21] why because it's the darkest hour
[1:10:24] that's the darkest hour where there's
[1:10:26] just a rampant scene there's just
[1:10:29] corruption
[1:10:30] some of sometimes i just feel like you
[1:10:32] know what maybe this is just america but
[1:10:33] i i found out i know it's all over the
[1:10:35] world
[1:10:36] anyway where you go because these things
[1:10:38] are spirits amen so let judah go up
[1:10:41] first let's praise him let's praise god
[1:10:44] first
[1:10:45] so these sayings that we read in
[1:10:46] revelations chapter
[1:10:48] 15 14 and 15 the bible says they were
[1:10:51] standing on the sea of on a sea of glass
[1:10:54] and the sea of glass if you read in the
[1:10:56] old testament the tabernacle of moses
[1:10:58] the tabernacle of moses had three
[1:11:00] compartments so the outer court there
[1:11:02] were two things that were on the outer
[1:11:04] court there was a an outer of sacrifice
[1:11:08] which had four horns
[1:11:09] those are the ones that you read in the
[1:11:11] bible which are called the horns of the
[1:11:13] out those are the horns that you know
[1:11:15] joab would go and grab when he was in
[1:11:17] trouble and then the other thing that
[1:11:19] was there was there was a was it was a
[1:11:21] brass a a a a a basin called a lava
[1:11:25] that they used to put water in the
[1:11:27] priest to wash their hands and wash
[1:11:28] sacrifices
[1:11:30] and that was in the old testament and
[1:11:32] that water represented the word that
[1:11:34] washes and cleanses us
[1:11:37] and here in the book of revelations we
[1:11:39] find that before the throne of god there
[1:11:41] is a sea of glass
[1:11:43] and the sea of glass and this one if you
[1:11:45] read chapter five the sea of glass was
[1:11:47] clear because the prophet says that you
[1:11:49] know redemption people the rapture had
[1:11:51] come but if you read chapter 15 this
[1:11:53] water it had fire and blood because
[1:11:56] these people were redeemed from the
[1:11:58] tribulation from difficult circumstances
[1:12:01] and because of that they were singing
[1:12:04] the song of the lamb amen that's a type
[1:12:07] of you and me we will not go through the
[1:12:09] tribulation the bride will not go
[1:12:12] through a tribulation but we are
[1:12:14] redeemed from different circumstances
[1:12:17] and we ought to sing the song of praise
[1:12:20] if we can stand upon our faith tonight
[1:12:23] have you lost the joy of your salvation
[1:12:26] are you here and you say lord i'm just
[1:12:28] coming to church but i've lost the joy
[1:12:31] of salvation you no longer read your
[1:12:33] bible the way you used to read your
[1:12:34] bible you no longer believe pray the way
[1:12:37] you used to pray you no longer read the
[1:12:39] the spoken word the way you used to read
[1:12:42] the spoken word you no longer sing the
[1:12:44] way you used to sing if you are there
[1:12:47] tonight you can show by raising your
[1:12:48] hand we can pray god can restore unto
[1:12:51] you the joy of your salvation let's pray

[1:17:21] savior the bible says repent
[1:17:24] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:17:26] name of jesus christ
[1:17:28] for the remission of sin you shall
[1:17:30] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:17:33] your backslidden gone away from god
[1:17:36] do you want
[1:17:37] to return
[1:17:39] he said if you return to me i will
[1:17:41] return to you said the lord

[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:12] you know
[1:18:14] everybody be so far back i think i'm
[1:18:16] going to do like brother hughes
[1:18:18] had to
[1:18:19] get those back seats roped off
[1:18:23] because it's hard
[1:18:24] sometimes so by the grace of god we
[1:18:27] thank god nevertheless for everyone to
[1:18:29] come
[1:18:30] this church amen
[1:18:33] there's many that we're praying for many
[1:18:35] needs
[1:18:36] but i think god is
[1:18:38] good
[1:18:40] we just want to praise him more and more
[1:18:43] i think if we heard anything tonight
[1:18:45] let's give god praise
[1:18:47] let's come to church with a praise in
[1:18:48] our hearts
[1:18:54] be thankful
[1:18:58] one dollar
[1:18:59] u.s dollar in zimbabwe is worth what
[1:19:03] one u.s dollar
[1:19:09] like thousands
[1:19:11] it takes thousands of zimbabwe dollars
[1:19:14] to make one u.s dollar
[1:19:21] and some of the conditions are really
