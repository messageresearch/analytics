[1:00:21] matthew chapter 5 if you've got your
[1:00:23] bible
[1:00:24] just appreciate god's grace to us
[1:00:29] you know when i was a boy
[1:00:32] i was raised in a little church that had
[1:00:34] later at some point become
[1:00:37] what they call return ministry in other
[1:00:39] words
[1:00:41] one day brother ram's gonna come back
[1:00:42] set up a tent speak us in resurrection
[1:00:44] and things and
[1:00:45] for many years our pastor never really
[1:00:47] revealed it until about the time we got
[1:00:49] married
[1:00:50] 1998 and i received the holy ghost in 91
[1:00:55] when i got born again these message folk
[1:00:58] come around and said
[1:01:00] give him time he'll quieten down
[1:01:04] he'll settle down a little bit i'll get
[1:01:06] a little age on him and he'll slow down
[1:01:08] a little
[1:01:10] them wet blankets have been trying to
[1:01:11] put my fire out for 30 years
[1:01:14] and it ain't getting worse it's getting
[1:01:17] stronger
[1:01:19] now you got to understand something
[1:01:20] about type church we come from you
[1:01:22] didn't amen
[1:01:23] you didn't clap your hands you didn't
[1:01:24] praise the lord you sat there twiddling
[1:01:26] your thumbs waiting on the prophet
[1:01:28] but i got news for you brother i'm glad
[1:01:30] jesus got to me
[1:01:31] before a whole lot of the rest of them
[1:01:32] did because god by his grace
[1:01:36] he helped me see what holy ghost and
[1:01:37] fire really is
[1:01:39] it ain't an emotion no i get that it
[1:01:42] ain't an emotion
[1:01:43] but it is the trueness of the holy
[1:01:45] spirit amen it is the
[1:01:47] infilling of the holy spirit if you love
[1:01:49] the lord shout amen
[1:01:52] god bless you matthew chapter five verse
[1:01:54] one thank you my brethren
[1:01:55] it's a privilege to play with you today
[1:01:57] matthew chapter five
[1:01:58] verse one and seeing the multitude now
[1:02:02] jesus is gonna go to the mountain and
[1:02:03] teach them a couple things
[1:02:05] i want you to pay attention to the way
[1:02:07] that this is worded because it's very
[1:02:09] crucial to understand the arrangements
[1:02:12] of the scripture here
[1:02:14] and he's seeing the multitudes he went
[1:02:16] up into the mountain and when he was set
[1:02:17] his disciples came
[1:02:18] unto him and he opened his mouth and he
[1:02:21] taught them
[1:02:22] taught them saying blessed are the poor
[1:02:26] in spirit
[1:02:27] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:02:29] let's pray over the word
[1:02:31] lord jesus what a privilege it is to be
[1:02:34] gathered here in the house of god
[1:02:36] lord i have no doubt in my mind that i
[1:02:38] am
[1:02:39] amongst the company of saints of god for
[1:02:42] lord jesus as we
[1:02:43] stand here in divine presence lord these
[1:02:46] folks around here the feeling that's
[1:02:48] reverberating around us these aren't
[1:02:49] hitchhikers
[1:02:50] they're not just people that just coming
[1:02:52] along for a ride and
[1:02:54] hopefully playing church as some people
[1:02:56] might think of it lord i can
[1:02:58] truly feel the movements of real
[1:03:01] christians in this place and i want to
[1:03:02] thank you for the atmosphere that's been
[1:03:04] amen presented before us today and lord
[1:03:07] god we want to ask you to come into this
[1:03:09] place hallelujah
[1:03:11] and that you would take your word and
[1:03:13] that you would speak to us expressingly
[1:03:16] lord god my lips are that yet of clay
[1:03:18] but
[1:03:19] thou art the master who speaketh and i
[1:03:21] anoint
[1:03:22] lord jesus thy word by prayer and i pray
[1:03:25] you'll anoint me with the holy spirit
[1:03:28] that i can take both and put them
[1:03:29] together by your grace
[1:03:31] to be a benefit a blessing to all of
[1:03:33] those gathered around us
[1:03:35] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[1:03:38] and amen and the saints of god said amen
[1:03:41] hallelujah praise the lord glory to god
[1:03:43] thank you jesus
[1:03:45] amen amen see some folk just get that
[1:03:48] say amen in there i want it all
[1:03:51] god bless you may be seated may the lord
[1:03:53] bless you real good
[1:03:54] hallelujah now i would tell you to turn
[1:03:56] shake hands with somebody but i don't
[1:03:58] know if i'm breaking rules asking that
[1:03:59] amen
[1:04:00] you just elbow at somebody or wave at
[1:04:02] him i guess amen i i'm
[1:04:05] i'm trusting that you know that the holy
[1:04:08] spirit can help me
[1:04:09] present this in the way that he showed
[1:04:11] it to me some months ago
[1:04:13] and if god will help me i want to try to
[1:04:16] speak to you this morning on those
[1:04:18] three little words that he spoke there
[1:04:20] blessed are they
[1:04:21] now there's many things we could go in
[1:04:23] and add on to that but i just want to
[1:04:25] focus on
[1:04:26] just a little bit of this beatitude i
[1:04:28] think it'll be a blessing to us if we
[1:04:30] looked at just some of it
[1:04:31] uh maybe uh you know sometime later uh i
[1:04:34] don't know maybe if we had a couple
[1:04:36] nights in a meeting or some kind of
[1:04:37] thing
[1:04:38] you know here at the church we might be
[1:04:39] able to take more of these type of
[1:04:41] things and break them down but
[1:04:42] uh you know just having the one service
[1:04:44] i'm just gonna hit the high spots for
[1:04:46] you
[1:04:47] try to give you as many scriptures and
[1:04:48] things from the message and what more
[1:04:50] that you can study this and
[1:04:52] trust it'll be a blessing to you because
[1:04:54] i believe
[1:04:55] that the word of god has power in it how
[1:04:58] many believe that's ryan
[1:05:00] this is not just an ordinary book and i
[1:05:02] want to say something to you and those
[1:05:04] that are listening
[1:05:05] if any man would look at you and say the
[1:05:07] bible is just a book
[1:05:09] they need to understand one thing that
[1:05:11] this is the only infallible book
[1:05:13] that we have in the world there is no
[1:05:15] dictionary there's no encyclopedia
[1:05:17] there's no concordance that has been put
[1:05:19] together more perfectly
[1:05:21] than the word of the lord this bible
[1:05:23] from his
[1:05:24] as the old fellow said give her to give
[1:05:25] her amen i like that
[1:05:27] amen from the cover to the other cover
[1:05:29] give her to killer he said
[1:05:30] there's never been a book more inspired
[1:05:32] in any other book
[1:05:34] amen that is inspired by some
[1:05:36] inspiration it
[1:05:37] might have artistic or musical
[1:05:39] inspiration behind it or
[1:05:40] political inspiration but the bible said
[1:05:43] that holy men of old
[1:05:44] were inspired by the holy ghost to put
[1:05:47] together
[1:05:47] god's thoughts in god's mind down here
[1:05:50] on the pages of the bible
[1:05:51] and i believe that the word of the lord
[1:05:53] as you just read the word of the lord
[1:05:55] just the words
[1:05:56] i believe they are the words of the lord
[1:05:58] but don't forget that every word
[1:06:01] is birthed from a thought somewhere the
[1:06:04] thinking
[1:06:04] has to be there before the word can be
[1:06:07] expressed
[1:06:08] and as believing christians as
[1:06:10] bible-believing christians
[1:06:12] we understand that especially in the
[1:06:14] english language that
[1:06:16] the english words can take on different
[1:06:18] meanings and they can have different
[1:06:19] sayings and different
[1:06:21] uh understandings behind them let me
[1:06:22] give an example what i mean
[1:06:24] if i use the word board this morning
[1:06:26] b-o-a-r-d
[1:06:27] i could say the spelling of it you know
[1:06:30] right away what i'm talking about but if
[1:06:32] i just pronounced it and said
[1:06:33] board well you don't know if i'm talking
[1:06:35] about a committee board a deacon board
[1:06:37] or
[1:06:38] board like a plank board like that or as
[1:06:41] some people
[1:06:41] are in church bored amen you have to
[1:06:45] know the thought
[1:06:46] behind what it is that i'm saying in
[1:06:48] order to catch the word that i'm trying
[1:06:50] to use
[1:06:51] and i believe the bible is the same way
[1:06:53] that many times the bible will use
[1:06:56] words and wording that we might think in
[1:06:59] our our natural way of looking at it it
[1:07:01] means one thing
[1:07:02] but if you catch the inspiration behind
[1:07:04] what it really means you'll understand
[1:07:06] it's an entirely different thing than
[1:07:08] maybe what we would use in english
[1:07:10] now let me just give you an example what
[1:07:11] i'm talking about when jesus uses here
[1:07:14] blessed are the poor in spirit that word
[1:07:18] poor
[1:07:18] in our english thinking or our english
[1:07:20] words we might translate that to say
[1:07:23] no money person that is poor destitute
[1:07:26] ragged
[1:07:26] they have nothing about them that you
[1:07:28] know has any economic value or no value
[1:07:31] or wealth or just poor
[1:07:33] but really the thought behind this word
[1:07:36] is
[1:07:36] not the word poor as in not having any
[1:07:39] money
[1:07:40] but what jesus is referring to here is
[1:07:43] those that are not poor as in
[1:07:45] financially destitute
[1:07:47] but those that are empty in other words
[1:07:50] an empty
[1:07:51] vessel those that are empty amen
[1:07:54] blessed are the poor or the empty in
[1:07:57] spirit
[1:07:58] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven so
[1:08:01] the word poor is what we would use it
[1:08:03] has a different thought behind it than
[1:08:05] what we would say oh he's poor
[1:08:07] she's poor they're poor that church is
[1:08:09] poor whatever
[1:08:10] so jesus here is referring to those that
[1:08:13] are blessed of god now let me say
[1:08:15] something to this church first
[1:08:16] before we get too deeply into the
[1:08:17] thought about blessings now i understand
[1:08:20] and you you can tell already that i
[1:08:22] enjoy
[1:08:23] worship in the lord i enjoy shouting and
[1:08:25] i enjoy good music and worship in god
[1:08:28] and and i certainly enjoyed the special
[1:08:30] this morning and
[1:08:31] i meant that was a wonderful selection i
[1:08:33] enjoyed amen the spirit of it
[1:08:35] and and i felt blessed we would say i
[1:08:38] felt
[1:08:38] blessed of the lord but i don't want you
[1:08:40] to forget that blessings of god
[1:08:43] are not just the outpouring of emotion
[1:08:46] and jesus is going to describe down
[1:08:48] through these beatitudes
[1:08:49] what the blessed are and what those
[1:08:52] blessings look like
[1:08:53] and actually when we look at what a real
[1:08:55] blessing is a real blessing has nothing
[1:08:58] to do
[1:08:59] with whether or not you felt a chill run
[1:09:01] down your back or you spoke in an
[1:09:02] unknown language
[1:09:03] or you saw a vision or whatever it might
[1:09:05] have been but the blessing of god goes a
[1:09:07] lot deeper than that
[1:09:08] as a matter of fact the blessings of the
[1:09:10] holy spirit are
[1:09:11] something amen that goes so deep into
[1:09:14] the soul
[1:09:15] that when you don't feel one thing is
[1:09:18] anybody hearing me this morning say amen
[1:09:20] amen when your flesh is dry amen in the
[1:09:23] skies are brass
[1:09:24] and you don't feel not one thing around
[1:09:27] you amen
[1:09:28] you are still blessed of god and the
[1:09:30] blessing is still following your life
[1:09:33] it's just like in divine healing when
[1:09:35] somebody comes to the platform and we
[1:09:37] lay our hands on them and we pray for
[1:09:38] them
[1:09:39] amen the blessing of that prayer because
[1:09:41] jesus said whoever you lay your hands on
[1:09:43] they shall recover
[1:09:45] amen and if they're sick in their body
[1:09:47] and we pray the prayer of faith over
[1:09:48] then the blessing of that prayer
[1:09:50] follows them around and the prophets say
[1:09:52] it this way amen whether or not in two
[1:09:54] days or three days from now
[1:09:56] a person begins to get sicker he said
[1:09:58] that don't have
[1:09:59] one thing to do amen with your faith or
[1:10:02] the prayer
[1:10:03] amen the blessing is still there no
[1:10:05] matter you feel it
[1:10:06] or whether you don't feel it oh my god
[1:10:08] i'm about to preach in just a moment
[1:10:10] but what i'm trying to tell you is that
[1:10:12] we have
[1:10:13] we have leaned too much upon the
[1:10:15] emotional side
[1:10:16] and the feeling side of religion amen i
[1:10:19] like it i enjoy it
[1:10:20] i want more of it but god almighty amen
[1:10:23] when the chips are down as they used in
[1:10:25] the world
[1:10:26] amen when all hell is breaking loose
[1:10:28] around me almighty god give me the
[1:10:30] strength
[1:10:31] and the dexterity and the foundation
[1:10:33] amen to stand right there on the
[1:10:35] promised word
[1:10:36] whether i feel it or whether i don't
[1:10:38] feel it let me have that confidence to
[1:10:40] know who i am
[1:10:42] where i came from and where i'm going
[1:10:45] amen we have a problem in our message
[1:10:47] we have a problem in the ranks of
[1:10:49] religion in general
[1:10:50] there is two classes of people there are
[1:10:52] those that despise
[1:10:54] holy godly worship sure they don't
[1:10:58] enjoy amen people getting loud
[1:11:01] they don't enjoy things like that now to
[1:11:03] me
[1:11:04] amen i don't believe every service we go
[1:11:06] to has to be a shout
[1:11:08] but i believe that the shout is there
[1:11:10] and you quench it you're displeasing the
[1:11:11] lord
[1:11:13] i've always said the person just needs
[1:11:15] to be flexible
[1:11:17] are you listening to me that if god
[1:11:19] wants you just to
[1:11:20] sit there and cry or sit there under the
[1:11:23] awe of the holy ghost and you can't
[1:11:24] hardly move a muscle
[1:11:26] amen that's just as religious of a
[1:11:28] service as if they're running the backs
[1:11:29] of the benches and shouting and
[1:11:31] hollering
[1:11:32] amen but people in this mode are often
[1:11:35] resistant
[1:11:36] to the outpouring of emotion and that's
[1:11:39] sad
[1:11:40] because without anything amen being said
[1:11:42] at all
[1:11:43] a human being is born emotional from the
[1:11:45] time they are
[1:11:46] separated from their mother's womb from
[1:11:48] the moment that they break the matrix of
[1:11:50] their mother's womb they're an emotional
[1:11:52] thing or they're a dead baby one or the
[1:11:53] other
[1:11:54] life will produce a stimulant life is a
[1:11:57] stimulant within itself
[1:11:58] and life will produce a reaction in
[1:12:01] somebody's body
[1:12:03] you know we call a person laying in a
[1:12:05] hospital bed with no responses
[1:12:07] amen they say they're brain dead but you
[1:12:10] can put a little meter on them and you
[1:12:12] can see
[1:12:12] laying in that hospital bed there's some
[1:12:14] sort of activity going on why
[1:12:16] amen life though it might be depressed
[1:12:19] though it might be amen and
[1:12:21] push down
[1:12:22] to where that the life is barely there
[1:12:25] but life will cause a reaction
[1:12:28] oh god is anybody hearing me this
[1:12:29] morning amen and why would i want to
[1:12:32] come into the gates of the holy ghost
[1:12:34] amen come into the presence of the holy
[1:12:36] ghost and stand there like a dried up
[1:12:38] old stick dead like a methodist
[1:12:40] and no understanding of what it means to
[1:12:42] worship god in spirit and in truth
[1:12:47] i'm called to be a priest
[1:12:50] that all right and what that means is
[1:12:54] priests didn't always feel like doing
[1:12:55] the service
[1:12:57] there might have been some wake up of a
[1:12:59] morning that had migraines
[1:13:02] maybe some of them didn't feel i don't
[1:13:04] know maybe we'd say on top of the
[1:13:06] mountain
[1:13:08] but yet they had a service to god
[1:13:09] whether their back was hurting
[1:13:11] whether they had sores on their feet
[1:13:13] whether or not they had a dental issue
[1:13:15] maybe their mouth was hurting or some
[1:13:16] kind of thing like that they were under
[1:13:18] obligation
[1:13:20] to go into that temple and do the works
[1:13:21] of the lord
[1:13:23] and when peter said you are a sacrament
[1:13:25] giving sacrificial lips
[1:13:28] he never spoke to us in the way of
[1:13:30] whether you felt it or whether you
[1:13:31] didn't feel it
[1:13:33] he just said you're a priest and you
[1:13:34] give sacrifice no matter what
[1:13:37] this is one reason why i believe that a
[1:13:39] true child of god
[1:13:40] can worship god if everything is going
[1:13:42] wrong
[1:13:43] if their body is hurting if they're
[1:13:45] wracked with pain amen how many of you
[1:13:47] seen on the
[1:13:48] laying on a death bed be able to raise
[1:13:50] up a little old hand and say
[1:13:52] glory to god in the highest why is it
[1:13:55] life will produce a reaction life is a
[1:13:58] stimulation and within itself
[1:14:01] it will react in some way then there are
[1:14:04] those that believe that
[1:14:05] life to be produced life as we would say
[1:14:08] what life is there's another side of the
[1:14:09] coin
[1:14:10] where some might say that life is just
[1:14:13] the output of constant emotion
[1:14:16] but i want to remind you that the sun
[1:14:17] got up this morning out of its bed from
[1:14:19] sleepy time
[1:14:21] amen and it put the moon away and when
[1:14:23] it got up in the morning it drew
[1:14:25] thousands and millions of gallons of
[1:14:27] water up into the heavens and it never
[1:14:29] made one sound
[1:14:32] oh hallelujah i meant for you to get a
[1:14:34] little quiet and listen but not dead
[1:14:37] come on now preach to me a little what
[1:14:40] i'm trying to tell you is not everything
[1:14:41] that is emotional is necessarily alive
[1:14:45] hey man we got copperheads in in
[1:14:47] tennessee you all got him here
[1:14:49] you ever killed a copperhead cut his
[1:14:50] head off he still moves and jerks and
[1:14:53] his body will quiver and carry on for
[1:14:54] hours afterwards
[1:14:56] even though he's got no head he's dead
[1:14:57] and he don't know it
[1:14:59] he's got he got reaction there's
[1:15:01] movement there but there's no life in
[1:15:02] there
[1:15:03] the life is leaving that body amen and
[1:15:05] it's producing a reaction
[1:15:07] sure but that's not the evidence of life
[1:15:09] in itself
[1:15:11] now with these two schools of thought
[1:15:13] you can see how
[1:15:14] modern day pentecost now we believe in
[1:15:16] the original pentecost but we are firmly
[1:15:17] against modern day
[1:15:19] we do not believe that we need gifts in
[1:15:21] order to have the holy ghost
[1:15:22] we do not believe that we have to see
[1:15:24] visions to be spiritual
[1:15:27] although spiritual people will see
[1:15:28] vision and spiritual people will have
[1:15:30] gifts
[1:15:31] but not everybody will have everything
[1:15:34] i'm reminded of
[1:15:35] sister florence ciccarion when brother
[1:15:38] branham had uh
[1:15:39] mentioned about her praying fasting she
[1:15:40] wanted to cast out devils she asked
[1:15:42] brother brown i i'm wanting to do it but
[1:15:43] i can't do it he said you wasn't called
[1:15:45] to it
[1:15:46] you were called to pray and fast for
[1:15:48] those who could
[1:15:51] i know we like to think that we'd like
[1:15:52] to have god pour out everything on us
[1:15:55] number one you couldn't handle it
[1:15:58] and number two you'd make a mess out of
[1:16:00] it if you got it all so would i
[1:16:02] so we just take what we get we tell our
[1:16:04] girls i've got three girls back home
[1:16:06] and they're with my mother in ohio for
[1:16:08] summer vacation as uh
[1:16:10] 14 years old should get maybe 15 october
[1:16:12] then 12 and then
[1:16:13] my baby is 6. and we tell the girls when
[1:16:16] they're little you know they like to eat
[1:16:17] you can see where they get that from
[1:16:20] amen and while they're
[1:16:21] in a restaurant or something like that
[1:16:23] we get them just a little potion we
[1:16:24] don't want them to have everything but
[1:16:25] we get them just a little bit and sit
[1:16:27] down and
[1:16:27] maybe the little baby would squall a
[1:16:29] little bit and i would say you get what
[1:16:30] you're getting you don't throw a fit
[1:16:34] amen that's the way i feel about it when
[1:16:36] it comes to the holy ghost
[1:16:38] if god chooses to bless us with things
[1:16:40] from on high
[1:16:41] we get what we get we shouldn't throw a
[1:16:43] fit
[1:16:44] we should be a blessed person to know
[1:16:46] god instills in us what he wants us to
[1:16:48] have
[1:16:49] i'm going somewhere i'm just trying to
[1:16:50] get this foundation in before we get
[1:16:52] there
[1:16:54] remember jesus is teaching now on the
[1:16:56] mountain he's not preaching
[1:16:58] preaching and teaching are vastly
[1:17:00] different they're different in this
[1:17:01] regard
[1:17:02] that if i'm just preaching the gospel
[1:17:04] just preaching in general
[1:17:05] i might say get saved get born again get
[1:17:08] to holy ghost
[1:17:09] get the new birth i might use all them
[1:17:10] terms and if i'm preaching it all means
[1:17:12] the same thing
[1:17:15] but if i'm teaching there's a difference
[1:17:16] in being saved
[1:17:18] and being born again and not everybody
[1:17:20] that receives the holy ghost is
[1:17:22] necessarily born again
[1:17:25] so jesus is teaching he's entering into
[1:17:28] a form of ministry
[1:17:30] glory to god where he is going to
[1:17:32] scripturally
[1:17:33] found the manifestation of the sons of
[1:17:36] god
[1:17:37] now remember before paul can ever lay
[1:17:40] the foundation for those sons
[1:17:42] he said no other foundation could be
[1:17:44] laid which was laid jesus christ
[1:17:46] so the lord is laying down the real
[1:17:49] character
[1:17:50] glory of what a manifested son will look
[1:17:53] like
[1:17:54] now i know a lot of people in the
[1:17:55] message and and different parts of the
[1:17:57] message they got it in their brain
[1:17:59] that a manifested son of god is somebody
[1:18:01] like brother branham that
[1:18:02] that when they walk out every time they
[1:18:03] walk out the front door they're seeing a
[1:18:05] vision
[1:18:06] remember men are called to certain
[1:18:08] things
[1:18:10] men have jobs men have responsibilities
[1:18:12] men are called to those things
[1:18:15] but having gifts and divine signs and
[1:18:18] wonders is no sign your god-selected
[1:18:20] child
[1:18:22] and when we look at manifestation of
[1:18:24] sons often
[1:18:26] we will point to the spiritual
[1:18:28] outworking of gifts and things in the
[1:18:30] prophet's life
[1:18:32] when that had nothing to do with whether
[1:18:33] he was a son of god or not
[1:18:36] unless you don't believe the bible which
[1:18:37] i will remind you gifts and the calling
[1:18:39] of god are without repentance
[1:18:42] any two-faced soured-up hypocrite
[1:18:44] moss-backed demon
[1:18:45] could stand there with a priest robe on
[1:18:47] or stand there with a preacher's tie on
[1:18:49] and cast out a devil supposedly
[1:18:55] brother bam said wisdom versus faith
[1:18:56] i've seen demons speak in tongues
[1:19:00] i've seen demons shout now i have to
[1:19:05] i've seen people in churches that i knew
[1:19:06] wasn't a bit more boring again than that
[1:19:08] guitar is born again
[1:19:09] and run the aisles and shout and scream
[1:19:11] and holler
[1:19:12] and living with somebody else's husband
[1:19:16] that ain't got nothing to do with the
[1:19:17] character of jesus christ and this is
[1:19:19] what god is laying down as his character
[1:19:23] because remember the blessings he's
[1:19:25] referring to here
[1:19:26] in matthew 5 are not just rain glory to
[1:19:29] god
[1:19:31] it's not just the reign of the holy
[1:19:33] ghost something to make you feel good
[1:19:36] but this is the actual divine nature
[1:19:40] hallelujah to god of a child of god full
[1:19:42] of the holy ghost that's been born again
[1:19:44] by the holy spirit
[1:19:45] this is the very character in nature
[1:19:49] another son and daughter of god
[1:19:58] blessed are they
[1:20:02] what kind of blessing
[1:20:05] are we supposed to receive well here's
[1:20:07] the question i want to ask you
[1:20:09] how can we receive a blessing
[1:20:13] if we're not empty
[1:20:16] because remember when peter stands up on
[1:20:18] the day of pentecost
[1:20:19] and he preaches this is that that was
[1:20:22] poured out by the prophet joel
[1:20:24] don't forget that in order for something
[1:20:28] to be poured out and something to be
[1:20:30] received it has to be empty down here
[1:20:33] before it can be received
[1:20:36] it wouldn't do me no good to take this
[1:20:37] bottle of water right here and pour it
[1:20:39] into something that's already full
[1:20:42] the container must be emptied out first
[1:20:45] and there
[1:20:46] lies our problem and i don't mean just
[1:20:48] this body here
[1:20:50] but universally around the world that's
[1:20:52] the biggest problem that christians
[1:20:54] really have more than anything
[1:20:55] else they're too full
[1:20:58] you've got so much on your mind that
[1:21:00] even some of you sitting here this
[1:21:02] morning are distracted from my words
[1:21:05] because of stuff that is filling your
[1:21:07] mind up
[1:21:09] you know that goes to proof it's not
[1:21:10] that you're not a christian not that
[1:21:11] you're not born again
[1:21:12] not that you're backslid it just goes to
[1:21:14] prove you need a time to empty out
[1:21:17] this is why jesus said cast all your
[1:21:19] care on me
[1:21:21] for i care for you this is why the
[1:21:23] scripture records
[1:21:24] take upon me
[1:21:28] cast all of your burdens there because
[1:21:31] as long as we are so filled up with the
[1:21:33] nonsense of the world
[1:21:34] there is no way that we can create a
[1:21:36] container for the holy ghost
[1:21:39] and don't remember any true child of god
[1:21:41] is an absorbent for the spirit of god
[1:21:43] not a repellant
[1:21:45] [Laughter]
[1:21:48] preach brother ben i think i will
[1:21:51] right amen no individual that is truly
[1:21:55] born to the holy ghost
[1:21:57] will ever resist the power of the holy
[1:21:59] ghost
[1:22:01] amen you may not even be a shouter but
[1:22:03] if the holy ghost comes as a shout
[1:22:05] you're just welcome to it yes lord i'll
[1:22:06] do what you want me to do
[1:22:11] i've heard people say through the years
[1:22:12] i'm just a quiet
[1:22:14] person i said sure until you see your
[1:22:17] grandkids hit a baseball home run or
[1:22:19] kick the soccer ball through the net
[1:22:23] one guy said to me i've preached to him
[1:22:24] for a number of years
[1:22:26] you're always trying to get me to say
[1:22:28] amen i'm just not in a manner
[1:22:30] i said you mean you're not a shouter
[1:22:32] you're not a neighbor you're not a
[1:22:33] motive i said no
[1:22:34] i said i challenge thee brother meet me
[1:22:37] in the office in a few moments
[1:22:39] i'm going to find me a deacon or a
[1:22:41] carpenter or
[1:22:42] a trustee or somebody's got a hammer and
[1:22:45] i want you to offer up the right hand of
[1:22:47] fellowship i'm going to take said
[1:22:49] a hammer and place it on said thumb and
[1:22:51] after i whack you if you sit there
[1:22:53] quiet you are have my just my my in my
[1:22:56] specific permission to remain quiet in
[1:23:00] church
[1:23:01] but if i whack you and you squeal you're
[1:23:03] doing nothing but making a bunch of
[1:23:04] excuses because you don't want to
[1:23:05] worship god
[1:23:12] right
[1:23:15] but remember the blessing of god is not
[1:23:17] always the emotional side
[1:23:19] listen to me friends a true child of god
[1:23:22] that's got peace
[1:23:24] they have peace in the middle of a
[1:23:26] situation or circumstances or set of
[1:23:28] circumstances
[1:23:29] that is not peaceable somebody say amen
[1:23:33] if you've got joy in your heart you can
[1:23:35] have joy
[1:23:36] when everything around you is not joyous
[1:23:40] right that is the true character of a
[1:23:43] child of god
[1:23:44] they are not dictated to by what goes on
[1:23:47] around them
[1:23:53] because any real believer that's got the
[1:23:54] new birth they are the master
[1:23:57] of every circumstance that goes on
[1:23:59] around them
[1:24:00] and you realize mastering circumstances
[1:24:03] goes beyond just speaking storms back
[1:24:04] into the heavens and creating squirrels
[1:24:07] but being a master of your circumstances
[1:24:10] might be as simple as you waking up of a
[1:24:11] morning and every day you wake up that
[1:24:13] old devil tries to make you depressed
[1:24:15] and sour
[1:24:17] and you wake up one morning determined
[1:24:19] in your heart them days are over
[1:24:22] and i'm going to take this joy i'm going
[1:24:24] to take this faith
[1:24:26] i'm going to take this peace glory to
[1:24:28] god i'm going to take all of that and
[1:24:30] i'm going to apply it to my life
[1:24:32] come on somebody and when i get up this
[1:24:34] morning i put my toes on the side of the
[1:24:36] bed
[1:24:37] i'm not going to be old sourpuss walking
[1:24:39] around but i'm going to let the joy of
[1:24:41] the lord be my strength
[1:24:43] amen that is a master
[1:24:46] of circumstances
[1:24:50] it can be that easy
[1:24:54] i'm a firm believer that a sister
[1:24:57] there's a situation going on in her home
[1:25:02] she's a prayer warrior or she talks to
[1:25:04] the lord anyways
[1:25:07] and she's got god's ear
[1:25:10] i believe that little lady could be
[1:25:11] vacuuming the floor kids in this way and
[1:25:14] grandkids this way and that and all
[1:25:16] mixed up every which way
[1:25:18] and i believe she could be vacuuming the
[1:25:19] floor like this is a holy ghost striker
[1:25:22] tip that vacuum cleaner up and so i take
[1:25:24] every spirit in here under my control
[1:25:27] for the glory of god in the name of
[1:25:28] jesus christ
[1:25:31] because you're a master the blessing of
[1:25:33] your life
[1:25:35] is not whether you feel it
[1:25:38] it's being empty and letting the holy
[1:25:40] spirit fill you up
[1:25:44] being poor in spirit represents humility
[1:25:48] i'm about to get in something right now
[1:25:50] you all ready
[1:25:52] as you can tell i'm not bashful so you
[1:25:54] shouldn't be either
[1:25:57] humility is a realization that all of
[1:25:59] your gifts and blessings come from the
[1:26:01] grace of god
[1:26:03] that's where everything i get comes from
[1:26:07] so i tell my girls and my wife when i
[1:26:09] have to travel a lot and i have to be
[1:26:10] away from them they're crying for me and
[1:26:12] things i say listen i love you so much
[1:26:15] i love you so much i said don't forget
[1:26:16] you are my gifts
[1:26:19] he is my giver and i have to be in
[1:26:23] service to him
[1:26:24] you are my gifts and i i
[1:26:27] appreciate you and i love you and i
[1:26:29] honor you for what you are
[1:26:31] but he is my giver who give you to me
[1:26:38] the bible said all things come down
[1:26:42] from the father of lights in whom has no
[1:26:44] variableness of turning
[1:26:46] in other words he he ain't going to give
[1:26:48] you one thing turn around and take it
[1:26:49] back
[1:26:51] whatever god promised he'll stick with
[1:26:53] it somebody say amen
[1:26:56] hallelujah i'm about to speak another
[1:26:58] language right now
[1:27:00] whatever he promised in his word he
[1:27:02] still keep it to the very letter
[1:27:04] you don't have to be afraid of it amen i
[1:27:07] read a little thing this morning i
[1:27:08] thought was so good so when you get into
[1:27:09] a plane
[1:27:10] you relax even though you don't know who
[1:27:12] the pilot is when you're on a boat you
[1:27:14] kick your feet up and relax even though
[1:27:15] you don't know who's driving the ship
[1:27:17] amen what about a child of god amen in
[1:27:19] this life as we live
[1:27:20] let jesus drive the boat and fly the
[1:27:22] plane and just relax
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:26] hallelujah let him take control of the
[1:27:30] whole situation
[1:27:33] yes being empty this is god's gifts
[1:27:37] to have poverty of spirit means to be
[1:27:38] completely empty
[1:27:40] and open to the word of god now
[1:27:44] you and i may not ever understand
[1:27:46] everything this book says
[1:27:48] but i remain open for the lord's
[1:27:52] interpretation
[1:27:54] i may not receive every interpretation
[1:27:56] that's given to me
[1:27:57] i may not receive every interpretation
[1:27:59] that is preached to me
[1:28:00] or somebody that tries to translate it
[1:28:02] to me or interpret to me
[1:28:03] what it means but if the lord wants to
[1:28:07] show me something
[1:28:08] even though it may take years before i
[1:28:10] get there i remain
[1:28:12] open for him to show me
[1:28:16] and brother sister therein lies the key
[1:28:17] of revelation if you want the holy
[1:28:19] spirit to reveal something to you out of
[1:28:20] your bible
[1:28:21] you just keep reading you just keep
[1:28:23] praying
[1:28:24] and don't forget the main important part
[1:28:26] remain open
[1:28:31] because there's many people that will
[1:28:33] read this book they will read this bible
[1:28:35] right here
[1:28:37] and not be open to what it has to say
[1:28:40] well if it be that way if that's the
[1:28:42] reason of it then tell me how come women
[1:28:43] still cut their hair
[1:28:45] there's bibles in every hotel room
[1:28:47] around this nation
[1:28:49] any of them can open up to first
[1:28:50] corinthians and reaper paul says it's a
[1:28:51] shameful woman to do such a thing why
[1:28:53] they still do it
[1:28:56] and i say this in the utmost respects
[1:28:58] when i was in africa
[1:28:59] some of our precious black sisters is
[1:29:01] that okay
[1:29:04] i they come to me they said well brother
[1:29:05] ben we got to trim the ends of it in
[1:29:07] order
[1:29:08] for it to grow out and be long i said
[1:29:09] you don't understand the message then
[1:29:12] because i said the prophet of god was
[1:29:13] asked a question about what long hair
[1:29:15] was
[1:29:16] and he never gave a description of the
[1:29:18] link 12 inches 14 inches that has
[1:29:20] nothing to do with long hair
[1:29:22] it's long when it's uncut
[1:29:26] when you don't put scissors in it or
[1:29:29] trim it off with
[1:29:30] fingernail clippers or burn it off with
[1:29:32] a curling iron or whatever some people
[1:29:33] do to get out of the side step the drill
[1:29:35] reality of the bible whoa getting quiet
[1:29:39] in here
[1:29:40] well if your sisters don't cut your hair
[1:29:42] you ought to be screaming amen
[1:29:45] sure the point i'm trying to make to you
[1:29:47] is i'm not trying to
[1:29:48] divert into a holiness scheme i'm not
[1:29:50] trying to bear down on you and put a
[1:29:52] spotlight make you feel bad what i'm
[1:29:54] trying to say to you
[1:29:55] is that if we are open to the word of
[1:29:57] the lord when we read the word there'll
[1:29:59] be something in us that will say
[1:30:00] help me understand it lord praise the
[1:30:04] lord god bless you brother i needed that
[1:30:05] amen right now
[1:30:09] he felt what i'm feeling
[1:30:14] if there's an openness to scripture
[1:30:18] and when they hear it read they'll say
[1:30:20] yes lord
[1:30:22] yea and amen to the word of god
[1:30:25] why is there such a resistance listen
[1:30:29] people are too full they're too full of
[1:30:32] theology
[1:30:33] they're too full of understanding from
[1:30:35] others they're too full of this that and
[1:30:37] the other and i believe with all of my
[1:30:39] heart
[1:30:39] that the people around the ranks of this
[1:30:41] message have come into a different stage
[1:30:43] they're in a different realm than the
[1:30:44] rest of the people around this world and
[1:30:46] i'll tell you why
[1:30:47] i believe that people have come into
[1:30:49] such a position
[1:30:50] to where they themselves have become
[1:30:53] their own absolute
[1:30:56] and such people will wind up in the
[1:30:58] tribulation period and wind up in hell
[1:31:02] because they believe their opinion is
[1:31:05] the sayeth the lord
[1:31:07] i got news for you brother be it a
[1:31:08] preacher be it a a monarch a potent tape
[1:31:10] being a schoolboy or schoolgirl
[1:31:12] amen let every man's word be alive and
[1:31:15] let god's be the truth
[1:31:23] i don't care how studied he is or how
[1:31:25] long it's been around truth or how long
[1:31:26] has preached or
[1:31:27] what kind of a big ministry he's got if
[1:31:29] he leaves that bible you leave it
[1:31:32] don't touch it leave it alone right
[1:31:35] i'm open that's what being empty simply
[1:31:39] means is to be open and receptive
[1:31:42] now you arm folders in here don't i'm
[1:31:44] not picking on you okay
[1:31:48] but you know when people come to the
[1:31:49] house of the lord and they just sit
[1:31:52] you understand what i mean and not that
[1:31:54] they're not listening not that they're
[1:31:55] not absorbing but i mean that resistant
[1:31:58] hard spirit i don't care what you read
[1:32:01] them or what you tell them
[1:32:02] you could take it right out of the bible
[1:32:04] take it right out of the message of the
[1:32:05] hour
[1:32:05] the holy ghost could come right back
[1:32:07] around behind that and confirm
[1:32:08] everything you're saying and they sit
[1:32:10] there and look at you like a mule
[1:32:11] staring at a new gate
[1:32:15] resistant to the spirit of god not
[1:32:18] interested in what anybody's got to say
[1:32:19] well there ain't no preacher going to
[1:32:20] tell me what to do well somebody's
[1:32:22] telling you what to do
[1:32:25] and if it ain't a preacher remember it
[1:32:26] is a preacher
[1:32:31] because satan was the one that preached
[1:32:32] in the beginning
[1:32:34] preached to the angels he preached to
[1:32:36] eve he's got a whole ministry team down
[1:32:39] here on the earth that's what paul said
[1:32:42] [Laughter]
[1:32:46] well i've enjoyed my time here with you
[1:32:48] brother simmons it's been good while it
[1:32:52] lasted
[1:32:55] come on now don't get quiet on me
[1:32:58] so i know we don't like to think of
[1:33:00] things like that but it is true
[1:33:03] satan has a great influence in the
[1:33:05] realms of religion
[1:33:08] don't forget in revelation 12 the entire
[1:33:10] world
[1:33:12] is deceived except for those whose names
[1:33:15] were on god's book
[1:33:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:33:20] hallelujah
[1:33:22] so if my name was on the lamb's book of
[1:33:24] life i
[1:33:25] cannot be deceived what are you afraid
[1:33:28] of then
[1:33:30] bring on all of the scandal bring on the
[1:33:32] false doctrine
[1:33:33] bring on the lies amen my soul
[1:33:37] my womb is stopped up i cannot receive
[1:33:40] anything
[1:33:41] that is falsely against the word falsely
[1:33:43] thus saith the lord if i'm a child of
[1:33:50] god the very evidence that i've got his
[1:33:53] holy ghost
[1:33:55] is that i'm open to his word
[1:34:06] this is what brother branham was trying
[1:34:07] to get us to understand when he said
[1:34:09] believing the message that term we've
[1:34:11] thrown that thing around
[1:34:13] until everybody's a believer and i got
[1:34:16] news brother
[1:34:18] forgive me for signing straight forgive
[1:34:20] me for signing harsh forgive me for
[1:34:21] sounding rude
[1:34:22] but you nor me or anybody else is a
[1:34:25] believer
[1:34:26] until god himself has come down and
[1:34:29] confirmed your faith
[1:34:31] with the seal of the holy ghost and said
[1:34:33] yes they are a believer
[1:34:36] because remember church remember little
[1:34:39] bride
[1:34:41] it's not when you accept the holy ghost
[1:34:42] it's when the holy ghost accepts you
[1:34:50] takes the power right out of our hands
[1:34:53] so the only thing we have left to do
[1:34:55] be empty
[1:35:03] praise god listen to this
[1:35:07] in perfect strength my perfect weakness
[1:35:09] brother said that's god's strategy
[1:35:13] to take empty human vessels and shake
[1:35:17] the world with them like he did at
[1:35:18] pentecost
[1:35:20] and pentecost wanted to do it took them
[1:35:21] 10 days to get all emptied up
[1:35:23] they were standing there with their
[1:35:24] vessels turned up glory
[1:35:26] that's why i want to be in church turned
[1:35:28] up
[1:35:30] when i play the piano i preach the
[1:35:31] gospel i've had many of them because of
[1:35:33] my big mouth
[1:35:34] and because of my loudness turn me down
[1:35:36] but i tell them don't turn me down
[1:35:38] turn me up i want to example what's
[1:35:39] going on in my own walk with god
[1:35:44] i ain't killed nobody yet
[1:35:49] amen but they were standing there with
[1:35:52] their vessels turned up and god took
[1:35:53] himself granted lord
[1:35:57] and filled them up he said that's all
[1:36:00] they shook the world
[1:36:01] he poured himself into them praise god
[1:36:06] that's the need of today that's what we
[1:36:09] need today
[1:36:10] is empty human vessels glory to god
[1:36:13] so god can fill them up
[1:36:18] don't you understand this is why we
[1:36:20] don't have bigger revivals
[1:36:22] this is why the churches are half full
[1:36:24] this is why the preachers preach at half
[1:36:26] speed
[1:36:28] people are too full and the ministry we
[1:36:30] get fed up with it
[1:36:32] you think you get tired of us bashing on
[1:36:36] you
[1:36:36] we get tired of you not wanting to be
[1:36:37] passed on
[1:36:40] you think you get fed up with with the
[1:36:42] nonsense and this side the other and we
[1:36:44] stand around
[1:36:45] and we preach about people not coming to
[1:36:47] church not paying their tithes not
[1:36:49] paying their offerings
[1:36:50] not loving one another and you get i
[1:36:51] wish he would shut up we wish you'd pay
[1:36:53] your tithe and offer to love one another
[1:36:59] see i'm preaching on ties and offerings
[1:37:00] i'm no pastor
[1:37:05] i can get away with it
[1:37:09] the point i'm making to you friends is
[1:37:11] we're too full
[1:37:14] we're too filled up with things
[1:37:17] when we come to the house of the lord
[1:37:18] and the man of god has spent his time
[1:37:20] absorbing that shekinah
[1:37:23] it comes out under the anointing of the
[1:37:24] dew of his ministry and he steps behind
[1:37:26] the platform
[1:37:27] he's ready to bring and there's nothing
[1:37:30] more frustrating than preaching to a
[1:37:32] bunch of people that are not ready to
[1:37:33] receive that their vessels are not
[1:37:34] turned up
[1:37:36] you know it's kind of like when you go
[1:37:37] to some of these specialty restaurants
[1:37:41] they have all of the silverware and the
[1:37:43] cutlery and everything laying on the
[1:37:44] table and
[1:37:45] if you've never been to one of these
[1:37:46] places generally what they do is when
[1:37:48] they
[1:37:48] aren't serving anybody they take
[1:37:50] everything turn it upside down
[1:37:52] that's the sanitation to keep things
[1:37:54] from falling in the cups and
[1:37:56] some waiter running by and a french fry
[1:37:57] fall off or some little dot or dollop or
[1:37:59] something
[1:38:01] it's a respectful thing to the guests to
[1:38:03] prove to them
[1:38:04] we are not ready to serve until you
[1:38:05] arrive
[1:38:07] and then when you sit down the way to
[1:38:09] the waitress they'll come up they'll
[1:38:10] start flipping everything over they'll
[1:38:11] turn them up
[1:38:13] because it's time for you to eat how
[1:38:15] often does a preacher come to the house
[1:38:17] of god and looks out across the
[1:38:18] congregation and there's cups turned
[1:38:20] upside down and plates flipped over
[1:38:23] not ready to receive what's being served
[1:38:26] by the lord
[1:38:29] then my precious friend in that
[1:38:30] situation if you walk out of the house
[1:38:32] being discouraged and you walk out of
[1:38:33] the church house feeling like you didn't
[1:38:35] get nothing
[1:38:36] take a look and see if you ever turned
[1:38:37] your cup up or not
[1:38:40] ask yourself was my plate ready to be
[1:38:43] filled
[1:38:45] or was it already full was something
[1:38:48] that the pastor of the evangelist or the
[1:38:50] teacher of the apostle prophet could not
[1:38:51] get to you
[1:38:53] because it was already filled up
[1:38:55] remember this is the reason that
[1:38:57] israel had become such a stench in the
[1:38:59] nostril of god
[1:39:01] listen at his words all of the tables
[1:39:05] are full of vomit
[1:39:11] how could god set down a seven course
[1:39:13] revelation
[1:39:14] how could he set down the blessings of
[1:39:16] the holy ghost the understanding of the
[1:39:18] godhead
[1:39:19] water baptism how could he have laid
[1:39:20] that on israel
[1:39:24] when they were so full that when jesus
[1:39:26] arrived they refused to believe he was
[1:39:28] who he said he was
[1:39:33] we know who you are you know what you're
[1:39:35] all about
[1:39:37] your mother had an affair with a roman
[1:39:38] soldier and you're trying to cover it up
[1:39:40] with something spiritual
[1:39:42] that's history they actually mentioned
[1:39:44] when they said
[1:39:45] we not be born in fornication that's
[1:39:47] what they're referring to
[1:39:50] it was wrote in history that they did
[1:39:52] not believe that
[1:39:54] mary was virgin
[1:39:57] some people still got that idea
[1:40:00] when i was going to school some years
[1:40:02] back i was in a debate with a fellow by
[1:40:03] the name of dr terry meath
[1:40:06] and dr mead if he ever hears this he's a
[1:40:08] personal friend of mine but he's a
[1:40:10] he's a real theologian well we had
[1:40:12] entered into a discussion about the
[1:40:13] that the humanity of christ
[1:40:16] and later on he sent me some remarks
[1:40:19] his letterhead was that all the way
[1:40:21] across it with
[1:40:22] abbreviated doctor's degrees and
[1:40:26] i thought who in the world did i lock
[1:40:27] horns with
[1:40:30] we were talking one day and he said to
[1:40:31] me
[1:40:33] he called me ben we were we were
[1:40:35] friendly like that i'd call him dr me
[1:40:36] that i respect and he said to me ben
[1:40:39] he said you claim that jesus christ had
[1:40:42] no part of the human system i said he
[1:40:44] didn't
[1:40:46] then tell me he said where did he get
[1:40:48] his humanity from if not from mary
[1:40:50] and not from joseph i sat there a moment
[1:40:53] and i thought lord
[1:40:55] you said take no thought when you come
[1:40:56] before men like this
[1:40:58] and before i could even speak i heard
[1:41:00] the holy spirit say it out of my mouth
[1:41:01] where did adam get his from
[1:41:05] [Laughter]
[1:41:08] praise god god was the father and god
[1:41:12] was the mother
[1:41:16] and when jesus stood there before him in
[1:41:18] the flesh his blood was not
[1:41:20] mingled with this serpent-seed affair
[1:41:24] don't forget of all of the animals that
[1:41:26] jesus could have chosen to identify
[1:41:29] when he would say you generation of why
[1:41:32] didn't he say brother
[1:41:33] simmons why didn't he say you generation
[1:41:36] of zebras
[1:41:39] you generation of rhinoceros
[1:41:42] out of all of the animals that jesus
[1:41:43] could have chosen to identify them
[1:41:45] pharisees with why did he call them
[1:41:46] vipers and snakes
[1:41:50] why did john tell him you're nothing but
[1:41:51] a bunch of vipers in the wilderness
[1:41:54] because that was where the original sin
[1:41:55] happened
[1:41:58] it was a serpent in the garden of eden
[1:42:00] whose later was changed and put on his
[1:42:01] belly as a snake
[1:42:04] sure jesus standing there his
[1:42:08] his blood the very blood cell was
[1:42:11] created by god
[1:42:14] oh you said but mary mary put yes
[1:42:17] she she pumped into that blood cell the
[1:42:19] vitamins to bring it to birth
[1:42:23] but the very creation of the blood cell
[1:42:26] has nothing to do with the food that is
[1:42:28] received
[1:42:32] because remember cell upon cell upon
[1:42:34] cell precept upon precept that builds
[1:42:36] itself
[1:42:38] the life was god's life are you with me
[1:42:41] say amen
[1:42:44] and when jesus stood there the holy
[1:42:46] virgin-born son of god
[1:42:49] he wept over jerusalem why
[1:42:52] why listen to me why
[1:42:55] did jesus weep over jerusalem
[1:42:58] because he come to a bunch of people
[1:43:02] that were full
[1:43:05] and couldn't receive not one blessing of
[1:43:09] god
[1:43:11] remember when he went into the city and
[1:43:14] said many great things he could not do
[1:43:16] because of their unbelief you see
[1:43:19] their unbelief had so clouded them
[1:43:23] until they could not be open to receive
[1:43:25] any blessing that jesus could give
[1:43:27] but he could walk right down to the well
[1:43:29] side where there was a prostitute
[1:43:30] standing there
[1:43:31] and she was wide open just like that
[1:43:32] well
[1:43:34] glory to god we know when messiah cometh
[1:43:38] he'll tell us he said why she wasn't
[1:43:39] standing
[1:43:40] filled up full of a bunch of theology
[1:43:43] she wasn't filled up on her own
[1:43:44] self-conceit
[1:43:45] oh well i'm a i'm a believer i'm a jew
[1:43:47] i'm a this i'm a
[1:43:48] just like people today well i was
[1:43:52] in this message before you was born well
[1:43:54] so was the devil what's that got to do
[1:43:56] with anything
[1:44:00] let a man tell me one time many years
[1:44:02] ago i'll have you
[1:44:04] know he called me benjamin you know that
[1:44:06] was to put a little sting on it have you
[1:44:08] know
[1:44:09] benjamin that i sat in the tabernacle
[1:44:12] with the prophet i said right next to
[1:44:14] the devil
[1:44:18] i said because the the most faithful
[1:44:20] member brother branham ever had was the
[1:44:22] devil
[1:44:23] he was in every convention he was in
[1:44:25] every revival he was in every church
[1:44:27] service i said when other people would
[1:44:28] miss
[1:44:29] satan was right there on the front row
[1:44:30] don't ever think he wasn't
[1:44:34] come on out that ain't got nothing to do
[1:44:37] with whether or not a person is going to
[1:44:39] be spiritual or not
[1:44:41] it's how open they are
[1:44:45] they tell me that after the squirrels
[1:44:46] were created
[1:44:48] that they were sitting around the table
[1:44:50] and some of those brethren that were
[1:44:51] there had told this
[1:44:53] now this is just table talk but take it
[1:44:54] for what it's worth
[1:44:57] but they said it when brother was
[1:44:58] talking about them squirrels they
[1:44:59] thought he was just telling a story and
[1:45:00] they were laughing
[1:45:02] cutting up and laughing with brother
[1:45:03] brother and they didn't take him too
[1:45:04] seriously when he talked that way
[1:45:07] but i said all at once that's when
[1:45:08] hattie walked in there and said
[1:45:10] that ain't nothing but the truth brother
[1:45:11] branham what i'm trying to tell you
[1:45:14] friends is that we can be sitting right
[1:45:15] in the middle of god himself
[1:45:18] not that brother brahma's god don't take
[1:45:19] it that way but we can be sitting right
[1:45:21] in the middle of the holy spirit himself
[1:45:23] sitting right in the middle of the
[1:45:24] presence of god and if we're not open
[1:45:27] he can't do nothing for us
[1:45:31] blessed are they blessed are they that
[1:45:35] can receive
[1:45:37] blessed are the empty
[1:45:40] can i go a bit further thank you no need
[1:45:43] to worry
[1:45:44] two more hours we're good
[1:45:50] jesus said in matthew 5 blessed are the
[1:45:52] poor in spirit
[1:45:54] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:45:55] remember
[1:45:57] the kingdom of heaven is not meat or
[1:45:59] drink
[1:46:01] but joy peace consolation
[1:46:04] in the holy ghost
[1:46:07] therefore if i am empty then i can
[1:46:10] receive the kingdom
[1:46:11] even jesus said it he made the statement
[1:46:14] very plainly when they said well
[1:46:15] where is he going to be at he said no
[1:46:17] don't look in the desert
[1:46:18] if they say here they say there you see
[1:46:22] people are still
[1:46:23] in that quandary today they still don't
[1:46:26] know where
[1:46:27] to identify god
[1:46:30] you will never find god hanging between
[1:46:32] the cherubims you will never find god
[1:46:35] sitting on a soapbox in heaven
[1:46:39] deity is with
[1:46:42] man and sister you're a part of that
[1:46:46] because every time the bible if you'll
[1:46:47] notice the bible always mention men very
[1:46:49] rarely mention women
[1:46:50] that's because you are the rib to some
[1:46:51] man somewhere
[1:46:53] and the blessing that comes from him is
[1:46:55] the same lesson that applies to you
[1:46:57] that there be no schism in the body of
[1:46:58] christ come on
[1:47:00] come on preach to me sometimes women can
[1:47:03] be more spiritual you're not left out of
[1:47:05] this sister
[1:47:07] oh you say they can't oh i know brother
[1:47:09] i felt that you hercules guys in here
[1:47:11] tell me
[1:47:13] i'll remind you who was it that came to
[1:47:15] pilate
[1:47:17] saying don't fool with this man jesus it
[1:47:19] was his wife
[1:47:21] you know why she was more open where god
[1:47:24] could deal with her
[1:47:26] glory to god words amen in case some of
[1:47:29] y'all forgot it
[1:47:36] right oh praise the lord we don't want
[1:47:40] that rutted place though
[1:47:44] david said i would rather be a doorman
[1:47:46] at the house of god
[1:47:51] but we don't want the doormat
[1:47:54] we we don't want to become the lowest of
[1:47:56] the low and the lowly of all lowlys
[1:47:59] we don't want to become a doormat that
[1:48:01] people can rub their feet on us
[1:48:04] that people can work on us all right
[1:48:06] doormat
[1:48:08] testify talk to us this morning
[1:48:13] you're a part of the kingdom of god tell
[1:48:15] me what you're worth
[1:48:19] nobody ever sees me nobody ever honors
[1:48:22] me
[1:48:23] nobody ever pays attention to me until
[1:48:25] they're wiping their feet on me
[1:48:32] but to be empty though i may not be
[1:48:36] called to that i've got to be willing to
[1:48:40] become
[1:48:45] some of y'all didn't hear me this
[1:48:46] morning let me say it again to you
[1:48:49] i may not be called to be a doormat but
[1:48:51] i must be
[1:48:52] willing hallelujah
[1:48:56] come on now preach to me for a little
[1:48:58] while amen i must be
[1:49:00] willing to become the lowest of all
[1:49:04] if i'm not willing to become that
[1:49:08] then god can never exalt me to that
[1:49:14] praise god
[1:49:19] some people are so against this kind of
[1:49:21] preaching
[1:49:24] of course because we have this elitist
[1:49:26] mentality
[1:49:28] we are in the message
[1:49:32] well good for you what do you want a
[1:49:34] cookie
[1:49:36] star a gold star a trophy
[1:49:39] you get a trophy
[1:49:47] put this right here this is what god
[1:49:51] wants to see
[1:49:52] is your willingness here
[1:49:58] don't forget the ma the man that quoted
[1:50:00] this was king
[1:50:02] david
[1:50:08] a man after god's own heart said
[1:50:11] i'd rather be this spoiler
[1:50:14] as the world calls it you know when they
[1:50:17] tell you the end of a movie they say
[1:50:18] it's a spoiler
[1:50:20] spoiler the reason david was a king
[1:50:25] is because he was willing
[1:50:30] to become that
[1:50:35] all but you say brother ben there ain't
[1:50:36] no way in the world i'd ever become like
[1:50:38] that right there
[1:50:39] and that's the reason you don't get
[1:50:40] nowhere i don't know you i'm just
[1:50:42] preaching okay
[1:50:44] don't get mad at me but the holy
[1:50:46] spirit's got your address
[1:50:48] he knows where you live at so if he's
[1:50:49] hitting you then you say all right lord
[1:50:51] thank you
[1:50:53] yeah please don't kill the messenger
[1:50:55] this is my first time give me mercy
[1:50:56] somehow
[1:50:57] let me get through this
[1:51:01] all right notice
[1:51:05] we don't have to be so much poor in
[1:51:06] money but poor in spirit now now here's
[1:51:09] something i want to i want to want to
[1:51:10] relate to you
[1:51:14] god help me say this right
[1:51:17] but in my travels in different parts of
[1:51:20] the world
[1:51:22] there isn't a presumption an assumption
[1:51:25] if you will
[1:51:28] that poor people are spiritual people
[1:51:32] we have instances in the bible we have
[1:51:34] lazarus laying at the gate we have the
[1:51:35] rich man
[1:51:36] that wouldn't go in and so the idea of
[1:51:40] the attitude is
[1:51:41] is that if we're poor ergo we are
[1:51:43] spiritual
[1:51:44] i'm about to say something i realize
[1:51:46] where i'm at and it's on the internet
[1:51:48] and all this
[1:51:49] i i'm not ashamed of this remark ain't
[1:51:51] the first time i've said this publicly
[1:51:54] but not just because somebody is poor
[1:51:57] don't make them open amen
[1:52:09] because a lot of times we'll say you
[1:52:11] know we have people around the ranks
[1:52:12] that will say things like
[1:52:14] well if a man's got an education must be
[1:52:16] of the devil
[1:52:18] somebody said to me one time educations
[1:52:20] have the devil the prophet said so i
[1:52:22] said brother branham
[1:52:23] was not talking about being educated in
[1:52:25] terms of having an education or having a
[1:52:27] trade
[1:52:28] he was talking about people using such
[1:52:30] things to figure god out
[1:52:33] man said well a man shouldn't have any
[1:52:35] education i said then quit eating and
[1:52:37] quit walking because somebody
[1:52:38] educated you on how to do both
[1:52:44] it's this mentality that has kept our
[1:52:46] churches like charity cases
[1:52:49] people have no degrees they have no
[1:52:51] trades they have no skills and they sit
[1:52:53] there in the church destitute and poor
[1:52:56] they have no education they can barely
[1:52:57] read if that's your state of life your
[1:52:59] station
[1:53:00] i'm not throwing off on you but when a
[1:53:02] person can do better and better
[1:53:04] themselves
[1:53:05] and better their families don't thank
[1:53:07] yourself as being less spiritual
[1:53:09] because you decide to get an education
[1:53:11] or because you decide to
[1:53:13] i mean i know i know a certain
[1:53:15] individual that i had went to school
[1:53:17] with myself many years ago he was 81
[1:53:19] years old
[1:53:20] and decided to return to college
[1:53:25] and the poor fella had been out of high
[1:53:26] school for so many years they didn't
[1:53:28] even call it high school
[1:53:33] he had to learn all over again how to
[1:53:36] learn
[1:53:37] but that didn't make the man closer to
[1:53:39] the devil and further away from god
[1:53:44] because you see when we come to any
[1:53:46] other age in paul's day they were poor
[1:53:48] in jesus day they were poor
[1:53:50] down through the church ages they were
[1:53:52] poor but when you come to lady osea
[1:53:55] the environment the culture is
[1:53:57] completely the opposite
[1:54:00] because some of you folk in here that
[1:54:01] would consider yourself poor
[1:54:03] you're rich compared to some of the
[1:54:04] people i've preached to
[1:54:06] you've got shoes on your feet you've got
[1:54:08] electricity in your house
[1:54:10] i preached to them where they didn't
[1:54:11] even have a pair of shoes
[1:54:14] now does that make those people more
[1:54:16] spiritual than you of course not
[1:54:19] because some of them same people are
[1:54:20] some of the most hard-headed people i've
[1:54:21] ever worked with
[1:54:25] glory i may end up having to preach and
[1:54:28] amen all at the same time before this
[1:54:29] thing's over with
[1:54:32] now just follow my thoughts here for a
[1:54:33] moment because what we have to
[1:54:35] understand when we come
[1:54:36] to the ladies and age it is an age of
[1:54:38] the abundance of earthly goods
[1:54:45] where often the criteria if you will
[1:54:50] or the gauge or the measuring stick of
[1:54:52] spirituality
[1:54:54] is how much money you've got
[1:54:58] you know that people will judge you
[1:55:00] based on what kind of car you drive
[1:55:04] judge you based on what kind of clothes
[1:55:05] you wear
[1:55:08] they'll judge a pastor based on the
[1:55:10] condition of the look of his church
[1:55:13] if you go to a place that's kind of run
[1:55:14] down a little wore out
[1:55:17] don't tell me you don't walk in there
[1:55:18] look around all them little spots and
[1:55:20] digs and dings and stuff around on the
[1:55:22] and think to yourself good night
[1:55:26] don't they have money for a bucket of
[1:55:27] paint
[1:55:30] huh and the quieter they get the harder
[1:55:34] i preach
[1:55:39] right because we get it in our mind that
[1:55:43] poor and wealth are criteria of how
[1:55:47] spiritual you are
[1:55:48] and none of that is true at all
[1:55:52] now is it true that it's hard for a
[1:55:53] wealthy man to make it into heaven jesus
[1:55:55] said so
[1:55:56] he that has riches like that it's hard
[1:55:58] for him to do it why because
[1:56:00] of the influences that surround him but
[1:56:01] brother don't be deceived
[1:56:04] the poor folk that i preached to in my
[1:56:06] lifetime they have spent
[1:56:07] many many a night surrounded by atheists
[1:56:11] bank robbers drug addicts
[1:56:14] people that would hate the very name of
[1:56:16] god surrounds them and tries to keep
[1:56:18] them from going to church
[1:56:21] but one reason it's harder for a rich
[1:56:23] person amen to move into that mode of
[1:56:25] being touched by the lord
[1:56:26] it's because the attitude is i don't
[1:56:29] need anything
[1:56:30] ah
[1:56:34] what happens if a poor person gets that
[1:56:35] mentality
[1:56:38] you know i've heard people say i've got
[1:56:40] everything i need right here
[1:56:41] what about god still need him
[1:56:45] because if you are flat broke and you
[1:56:48] have that ladies and attitude
[1:56:50] you will go to hell just as quickly as
[1:56:52] the millionaire will
[1:56:54] as a penny heir will go just as quickly
[1:56:56] as a millionaire will
[1:56:59] whoa amen
[1:57:04] the bible didn't say money was the root
[1:57:05] of all evil it said the love of it
[1:57:08] and love will produce an attitude
[1:57:12] i've seen people in churches they are so
[1:57:14] stingy
[1:57:15] they pull the hairs off of george
[1:57:17] washington dropping a dollar into the
[1:57:18] offering
[1:57:20] my father-in-law used to say they
[1:57:22] squeezed the nickel so tight the buffalo
[1:57:24] begs the indian to shoot it
[1:57:29] amen not trying to be funny but such a
[1:57:32] stinginess such a
[1:57:33] an attitude oh i ain't going to do that
[1:57:36] and you will not put a dollar in church
[1:57:37] and then turn right around and go out
[1:57:38] and pay
[1:57:39] 25 at mcdonald's for a sack of
[1:57:41] hamburgers
[1:57:48] see attitude again my point is
[1:57:52] we're too full we're filled up full of
[1:57:55] all of these things
[1:58:00] if ain't none of y'all been praying
[1:58:01] you're praying god let that preacher
[1:58:03] quit
[1:58:05] before he digs any deeper
[1:58:08] [Laughter]
[1:58:10] when i start feeling like that i know i
[1:58:12] am right where i belong
[1:58:16] i'm digging in the right tater patch
[1:58:22] yes sir look here matthew chapter 12
[1:58:26] verse 43 and 44
[1:58:28] when the unclean spirit has gone out of
[1:58:30] a man he walketh through dry places
[1:58:32] seeking rest
[1:58:34] and finding none then he saith i will
[1:58:37] return into my house from whence i came
[1:58:39] out
[1:58:40] and when he has come he findeth it empty
[1:58:46] swept and garnished now listen what i'm
[1:58:49] going to say don't misunderstand me
[1:58:51] i believe we should receive the holy
[1:58:52] ghost if we are called to receive the
[1:58:54] holy ghost but listen careful
[1:58:57] the foolish virgin go out of this world
[1:58:59] swept
[1:59:00] and garnished and clean but not filled
[1:59:04] now i'm not advocating that any of us
[1:59:06] should accept anything less than what
[1:59:07] god would have for us
[1:59:10] but if in the in the scope or the canon
[1:59:12] of my life
[1:59:14] if all i could do in the very end was
[1:59:16] just remain empty
[1:59:19] i'd rather have that
[1:59:22] than have the world fill me up full of
[1:59:24] pleasures and everything else
[1:59:28] i know i know that gets down to a place
[1:59:31] we don't like to think of it
[1:59:35] i would rather remain empty even if it
[1:59:38] meant that god would not fill me
[1:59:41] with the holy ghost i would rather
[1:59:43] remain empty
[1:59:47] because that would at least be a sign of
[1:59:48] my faith toward him
[1:59:51] that even though i may not be able to
[1:59:52] receive the holy ghost i'm not going to
[1:59:54] let the devil occupy me either
[1:59:57] i'll remain virgin to you
[2:00:01] in luke chapter 1 verse 46 and 53 those
[2:00:04] two verses
[2:00:05] mary said my soul doth magnify the lord
[2:00:07] he hath filled the hungry with good
[2:00:09] things
[2:00:10] amen now i know a lot about eating
[2:00:15] you all don't have to say amen i get it
[2:00:17] you're with me
[2:00:20] i learned one thing about true hunger
[2:00:25] hunger in my stomach like i feel right
[2:00:27] now
[2:00:29] is the evidence that i am empty and i
[2:00:31] need to be filled
[2:00:34] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[2:00:37] for they shall be filled
[2:00:39] you can't be hungry if you're full
[2:00:44] oh you listen to me say amen
[2:00:48] proverbs 16 19 better it is to be of a
[2:00:50] humble spirit with the lowly
[2:00:54] than to divide the spoil with the proud
[2:00:58] proverbs 29 23 a man's pride shall bring
[2:01:01] him low
[2:01:04] but honor shall uphold the humble in
[2:01:06] spirit
[2:01:08] a couple more things we're going to quit
[2:01:10] humility is an
[2:01:11] aspect of christianity that we still
[2:01:14] have not got worked out yet
[2:01:16] because humility in our mind's eye
[2:01:19] is the way we dress the way we speak
[2:01:23] and our behavior that is not humility
[2:01:26] humility has nothing to do with the
[2:01:28] outward actions of your body
[2:01:31] no it doesn't because you take all of
[2:01:33] those humble people
[2:01:34] that are in a catholic convent right now
[2:01:36] praying on concrete
[2:01:40] the action of their body is in the most
[2:01:42] lowest of piety
[2:01:45] that is not humility that might be
[2:01:48] humbling themselves in a manner
[2:01:51] but that is not godly gospel humility
[2:01:53] don't forget gospel bible words
[2:01:55] have different meanings than the
[2:01:56] definitions we put to them
[2:01:59] but true humility and again sister it's
[2:02:01] more than just the length of your hair
[2:02:02] brothers whether you don't wear
[2:02:03] shorts and these type of things but true
[2:02:07] gospel humility are you listen
[2:02:12] is remaining empty
[2:02:16] and remaining sensitive
[2:02:19] for the lord's leading
[2:02:23] if you are open to the word
[2:02:27] if god tells some of you boys don't go
[2:02:30] running around here with a pair of
[2:02:32] shorts on
[2:02:33] what you shouldn't then you're open to
[2:02:36] that
[2:02:37] all right lord no problem now i'm going
[2:02:39] to use simple little examples to get a
[2:02:41] point across
[2:02:42] don't get hung up on it okay
[2:02:45] if god tells a man don't cheat your
[2:02:48] taxes
[2:02:50] you're open to what the lord says about
[2:02:52] it and you will respond accordingly
[2:02:56] not everything that has a long dress and
[2:02:57] long hair necessarily has a full heart
[2:03:01] and not everything that wears a suit and
[2:03:03] tie and packs a bible
[2:03:05] is necessarily godly and full of the
[2:03:07] holy
[2:03:13] oh you're ghost about my daddy i'm
[2:03:15] talking about whoever it is
[2:03:17] oh you're talking about preacher
[2:03:18] so-and-so i don't care what their name
[2:03:20] is
[2:03:21] or who she is humility is not the
[2:03:25] behavior of how we dress on the outside
[2:03:27] if it be that way then the amish have
[2:03:29] got all of us beat
[2:03:33] you know my wife i don't know what this
[2:03:35] thing has been but you know for the last
[2:03:36] three weeks
[2:03:37] we keep running into amish people who
[2:03:39] smoke
[2:03:41] that's the craziest thing i ever saw in
[2:03:42] my life my wife was just we was in ohio
[2:03:44] and there was a bunch of them standing
[2:03:46] outside of a van and these men just
[2:03:47] puffing away like freight trains
[2:03:49] just a few days ago she was in line
[2:03:51] getting some paying for some gas and
[2:03:53] there was an amish man standing there
[2:03:54] getting buying tobacco
[2:03:56] i never seen such as that i thought lord
[2:03:58] if we've slipped or the amish are
[2:04:00] smoking now
[2:04:02] we hadn't been a worse shape than i
[2:04:03] thought
[2:04:09] but if it's the attitude or the outside
[2:04:11] or the behavior on the outside if that's
[2:04:13] what humility is
[2:04:15] don't misunderstand me now but the
[2:04:17] devil's got every one of us be
[2:04:20] cause satan knows how to impersonate
[2:04:21] every bit of that
[2:04:25] therefore true humility is not what we
[2:04:28] do on the outside now you're saying
[2:04:29] brother ben we shouldn't live holy
[2:04:31] if you listen to the entire statement
[2:04:33] again
[2:04:34] i think you'll be able to pick out that
[2:04:36] it's not that way
[2:04:38] because let me repeat it one more time
[2:04:41] to make it clear
[2:04:42] for those here online that hear let's
[2:04:44] make this very clear
[2:04:46] true humility is being open to respond
[2:04:49] to what god said
[2:04:50] right if god said don't cuss or don't
[2:04:54] lie
[2:04:54] or don't cheat you're open you may not
[2:04:57] master it
[2:04:58] but you're open god help me
[2:05:02] you might have a little besetting sin
[2:05:04] like paul said that you fight on a daily
[2:05:06] basis but you're open
[2:05:08] god help me live right help me live holy
[2:05:13] and as a result i believe you will
[2:05:18] right well it's what it looks like on
[2:05:22] the outside
[2:05:23] oh i figured that would come all right
[2:05:26] here we go
[2:05:28] so what are we going to do about the
[2:05:29] woman then sitting at the tabernacle
[2:05:31] this is on tape
[2:05:32] who brother branham identified as a babe
[2:05:34] in christ sitting on the piano with a
[2:05:36] short dress cut hair and makeup on her
[2:05:38] face
[2:05:38] and the people were pitching a fit about
[2:05:40] it
[2:05:42] and you know what brother bram said
[2:05:43] leave her alone
[2:05:46] she is a baby in christ you know why
[2:05:48] because
[2:05:49] jesus said when he the spirit of truth
[2:05:51] has come
[2:05:52] he will reprove the world of
[2:05:53] righteousness so when the holy ghost
[2:05:55] comes into an individual
[2:05:57] he will start doing the correcting and
[2:06:00] the straightening out in your life
[2:06:02] and brother branham knew that that woman
[2:06:04] had truly received the holy ghost
[2:06:06] and it was only a matter of time before
[2:06:09] she started lining up
[2:06:10] step by step by step by step
[2:06:15] but some of us around the message we
[2:06:17] would have had
[2:06:18] heart failure if we would come into a
[2:06:21] church and see somebody in that
[2:06:22] condition we would
[2:06:29] it goes to prove our understanding of
[2:06:31] humility is not as mature as it needs to
[2:06:32] be
[2:06:34] [Laughter]
[2:06:37] well you ain't no special group
[2:06:39] everybody i've preached to thus far has
[2:06:40] reacted the same ways
[2:06:44] don't think yourself odd or strange
[2:06:48] but the reason i preach this way is
[2:06:50] because brother we need to understand
[2:06:51] these things
[2:06:52] we need to understand what true humility
[2:06:53] is not everything that packs the bible
[2:06:56] and says brother ramsey's name is a
[2:06:57] christian
[2:07:04] that's like one fellow i was sitting in
[2:07:06] a service one time and he said
[2:07:07] let me prove to you got the holy ghost
[2:07:09] my wife and i were sitting in the back
[2:07:11] of the church we'd come in a little bit
[2:07:12] late because i i knew the pastor well i
[2:07:14] didn't want to put pressure on him make
[2:07:15] him feel like he had to ask me to preach
[2:07:17] or something like that so i
[2:07:18] slipped in the back and i was sitting
[2:07:19] down and thankfully this other speaker
[2:07:21] was there
[2:07:22] and this fellow said let me prove to you
[2:07:24] got the holy ghost and he
[2:07:25] he said how many in here believes god
[2:07:27] sent a prophet put your hand up
[2:07:29] all right now i want you to help me do
[2:07:30] this all right you believe brother man
[2:07:32] was a prophet put your hand up like this
[2:07:34] all right now i'm going to answer one
[2:07:35] more thing i said to my wife
[2:07:38] every devil in hell is raising their
[2:07:40] hand too
[2:07:45] do you realize that the devil don't even
[2:07:48] believe his own trinitarian doctrine
[2:07:54] because the bible said he believes in
[2:07:55] one god
[2:07:57] and he trembles he knows there ain't no
[2:08:01] three sitting up there
[2:08:03] come on church
[2:08:07] he knows he's won
[2:08:15] oh i believe brother is a prophet so
[2:08:17] does the devil
[2:08:19] yeah a little further
[2:08:25] in matthew chapter 18 verse 4 whosoever
[2:08:27] thou shalt shall humble himself as this
[2:08:29] little child
[2:08:32] the same as the greatest in the kingdom
[2:08:35] of heaven
[2:08:38] [Laughter]
[2:08:42] here comes all these big preachers peter
[2:08:44] and james and john all of them they just
[2:08:45] got their chest stuck out
[2:08:47] who's the greatest in here lord
[2:08:50] jesus looks around come here little boy
[2:08:54] [Laughter]
[2:08:56] he takes that little fella and goes
[2:08:58] right here's the greatest
[2:09:01] could you imagine them big shot
[2:09:04] preachers
[2:09:05] judas and all them standing right there
[2:09:07] thought he was a hot shot anyway
[2:09:09] and saw that little boy standing there
[2:09:13] i imagine they probably thought about
[2:09:15] like i thought when i threw that door
[2:09:16] mat up there i like you all thought
[2:09:20] that that's what god wants us to become
[2:09:26] but remember the way up
[2:09:30] and the way down
[2:09:35] yeah matthew 23 12 whosoever shall exalt
[2:09:39] himself shall be abased
[2:09:40] and he that shall humble himself shall
[2:09:42] be exalted
[2:09:44] james chapter four verse six and verse
[2:09:46] ten
[2:09:48] not through now but those two verses six
[2:09:50] and ten he giveth more grace wherever we
[2:09:51] say if god resisteth the proud
[2:09:54] but gives grace to the humble humble
[2:09:56] yourselves in the sight of god he shall
[2:09:58] lift you up how do you how do you do
[2:10:00] that become empty brother brain gives us
[2:10:03] a great example that when he tells us in
[2:10:04] voice of the sign
[2:10:06] go into a place and pray until all the
[2:10:07] other voices are quiet
[2:10:11] pray until just like in jerusalem how
[2:10:13] long lord
[2:10:14] until you'll know when it arrives
[2:10:18] somebody asked me just the other day how
[2:10:20] do you know you have the holy ghost i
[2:10:21] said if you
[2:10:21] are even asking me that you don't have
[2:10:23] it
[2:10:25] because no man or no woman that's ever
[2:10:27] met god
[2:10:28] can ever deny the meeting of the lord
[2:10:30] jesus christ
[2:10:32] he has an influence on your life
[2:10:35] now i don't mean some of you that have
[2:10:36] come along and you've been baptized and
[2:10:38] you're doubting your experience and the
[2:10:39] devil's trying to throw you off the
[2:10:40] trail and but
[2:10:42] even you folk that would come back
[2:10:45] afterwards and maybe you would say
[2:10:47] i just don't know if i got it or not
[2:10:48] even you if you've got anything at all
[2:10:50] can point back to a time in your life
[2:10:52] to where almighty god met you at some
[2:10:54] place
[2:10:56] just because you don't have the
[2:10:57] confidence of your experience don't mean
[2:10:59] you didn't have the experience
[2:11:02] right
[2:11:05] now turn turn with me to this one i want
[2:11:07] you to read this with me
[2:11:08] romans chapter 1 verse 28
[2:11:12] last scripture we quit we quit and we
[2:11:14] quit and we couldn't
[2:11:16] don't get it on your mind that we
[2:11:17] couldn't but we quit
[2:11:22] in first peter 5 and 5 he said likewise
[2:11:24] younger submit yourself to the elder
[2:11:26] all of you be subject to one another one
[2:11:29] to another and be clothed with humility
[2:11:31] for god resisteth the proud and giveth
[2:11:34] grace to the humble
[2:11:35] therefore humble yourselves therefor
[2:11:36] unto the mighty hand of god that he may
[2:11:38] exalt you
[2:11:38] in due time romans chapter 1 28
[2:11:42] and even as they did not like to retain
[2:11:44] god in their knowledge
[2:11:47] god gave them over to a reprobate mind
[2:11:49] to do those things which are not
[2:11:51] convenient all right how he's got the
[2:11:53] bible open raise your hand
[2:11:56] look at the next two words
[2:12:05] being filled
[2:12:11] and that in itself is self-explanatory
[2:12:16] this is the reason god turned these
[2:12:18] people over to a reprobate mind
[2:12:23] not that god didn't want to help them
[2:12:26] not that the lord didn't want to reach
[2:12:28] his hands out and do something for him
[2:12:31] not that the lord jesus didn't have a
[2:12:33] desire
[2:12:35] to take his heart and pour it into their
[2:12:37] life
[2:12:39] i wish people would get this out of
[2:12:41] their mind that the holy spirit
[2:12:43] is some kind of a dictator waiting for
[2:12:46] you to make one mistake so he can
[2:12:48] bam hit you with a lightning bolt and
[2:12:49] send you to hell if we
[2:12:51] only knew the long-suffering and the
[2:12:53] true grace of god for each and every one
[2:12:55] of us me included
[2:12:56] amen we would be shining the roof off
[2:12:58] this place knowing how patient he's been
[2:13:00] with us
[2:13:03] he's never been angry for keeps
[2:13:09] though his anger would endure for a
[2:13:11] little while
[2:13:13] though it lasts for a little while joy
[2:13:16] comes in the morning
[2:13:19] this is the reason god turned these
[2:13:20] people over to a reprobate mine
[2:13:24] if satan's trying to tell some of you
[2:13:25] sitting here this morning
[2:13:27] i will never be anything more than what
[2:13:29] i am i'm a loser i'm worthless i'm
[2:13:32] no good i'm sorry god's probably already
[2:13:35] dismissed me and got rid of me and i'm
[2:13:37] done
[2:13:38] the only reason he would do such a thing
[2:13:42] is if you were filled
[2:13:46] with other things and wouldn't let him
[2:13:49] have entrance
[2:13:52] when he come to the door of his own
[2:13:54] church in ladies
[2:13:57] he wasn't allowed occupancy why
[2:14:01] someone else was already occupying it
[2:14:07] if christ was on the outside please
[2:14:09] somebody tell me who was on the inside
[2:14:15] satan the god of this world had already
[2:14:18] blinded their eyes and they shut him out
[2:14:25] message people i want to say something
[2:14:28] to you
[2:14:29] though this is our first meeting and i'm
[2:14:31] i'm getting pretty common with you
[2:14:33] already i guess pretty pretty down to
[2:14:34] earth
[2:14:36] but please listen to me if i found favor
[2:14:37] with you in a little bit please listen
[2:14:39] to my next words
[2:14:41] if we're not careful our have need of
[2:14:44] nothing attitude
[2:14:47] is going to put us in a place so we're
[2:14:48] going to shut christ completely ahead of
[2:14:50] our lives
[2:14:52] and out of our churches
[2:14:55] it already is now that you're not even
[2:14:58] considered a message preacher unless
[2:15:00] you're throwing brother rams name around
[2:15:01] a thousand times
[2:15:04] that'll make you a message preacher that
[2:15:05] makes you being able to read
[2:15:10] hello oh glory to god i'm a
[2:15:14] i'm a believer of the message
[2:15:18] yeah but as god said you are as you've
[2:15:22] indicated it with the baptism of the
[2:15:23] holy ghost
[2:15:26] if he hasn't then you're still too full
[2:15:29] yeah boasters haters
[2:15:34] backbiters
[2:15:36] three messages i want to read one line
[2:15:38] in pride he said my subject tonight is
[2:15:40] pride what a cursed thing
[2:15:44] so awful so evil he says his pride again
[2:15:47] unwelcome christ what a horrible curse
[2:15:50] pride is
[2:15:50] queen of the south you see what pride
[2:15:53] and selfishness does
[2:15:56] it shuts you out from the kingdom
[2:16:00] of god
[2:16:05] lord jesus
[2:16:09] how many people have we seen depart our
[2:16:11] ranks
[2:16:13] for that very reason right there
[2:16:17] we become so arrogant and so prideful
[2:16:22] we think we've got the cat by the tail
[2:16:24] as the expression goes but we don't know
[2:16:27] that
[2:16:27] god is the only one that gives us the
[2:16:29] strength
[2:16:31] to know thus saith the lord
[2:16:36] if i've learned one thing in my 30 years
[2:16:38] of serving him since i've been a boy
[2:16:40] i've learned that in the times that i
[2:16:42] always thought that maybe i was holding
[2:16:44] on
[2:16:45] i found out it was him holding on to me
[2:16:49] play something brother
[2:16:50] if you don't i'm going to get out of
[2:16:51] this i'm going to keep going you keep
[2:16:53] pulling i keep preaching he's got to get
[2:16:54] me out
[2:16:58] thank you for that thank you for pulling
[2:17:02] but i want you to understand the very
[2:17:05] reason that we as christians
[2:17:08] repent it's not saying words
[2:17:12] see this is where altar calls have
[2:17:14] failed
[2:17:15] because you get people up here and they
[2:17:17] kneel down before the lord
[2:17:19] and they start saying words god i'm
[2:17:21] sorry for this i'm sorry i'm a low down
[2:17:23] scum i'm
[2:17:24] good for nothing i'm a liar i'm a
[2:17:26] whoremonger i'm
[2:17:29] y'all y'all reckon god didn't know that
[2:17:31] before you come to the altar
[2:17:34] so is repentance you having to come and
[2:17:36] remind him of what you are
[2:17:39] you mean when you were sitting in the
[2:17:40] pew and that preacher was preaching
[2:17:42] and and that dark cloud sat over top of
[2:17:44] you trying to keep you from
[2:17:46] from getting closer to the lord and the
[2:17:48] gospel coming and cast that devil away
[2:17:50] from you where you could hear truth for
[2:17:51] a moment
[2:17:52] and all of a sudden the sunlight of god
[2:17:54] permeated and hit that soul
[2:17:56] and you started responding i'm a sinner
[2:17:59] i need a savior are you trying to tell
[2:18:02] me that
[2:18:03] you didn't that god didn't know what you
[2:18:05] was when he dealt with you
[2:18:09] then why would our repentance just be a
[2:18:11] matter of words
[2:18:13] that's not repentance what they call the
[2:18:16] sinner's prayer
[2:18:19] that's just a ritual we perform let me
[2:18:22] tell you what real repentance is
[2:18:24] it's coming before his presence and it's
[2:18:26] opening up your heart and saying lord
[2:18:29] you already see what's in here
[2:18:32] and i'm opening myself up for you to
[2:18:34] clean me out
[2:18:37] of anything that is contrary to you
[2:18:40] be it my attitude be it my opinions
[2:18:43] be it my teachings be it my own
[2:18:46] honorings or my own spirits of lust or
[2:18:50] debate or whatever it might be god
[2:18:53] i'm open for you to come
[2:18:56] clean me church that's what real
[2:19:00] repentance looks like
[2:19:04] you're saying you're sorry and god
[2:19:06] forgive me for this and god forgive me
[2:19:07] for that
[2:19:08] that's wonderful don't discontinue doing
[2:19:10] that
[2:19:11] but don't say words without also
[2:19:13] accompanying it with lord
[2:19:15] clean me i'm open because
[2:19:18] i've seen people come to the altar i've
[2:19:19] worked these altars for
[2:19:21] many many years and i watch them come
[2:19:22] right up here and pray and i've seen
[2:19:24] them cry and cry and cry
[2:19:26] and then when i get down close to them
[2:19:27] and i put my hand on them
[2:19:30] and while i'm under the anointing of the
[2:19:31] holy ghost you know how this brother
[2:19:32] simmons many times
[2:19:34] you can feel whether that person's ready
[2:19:36] or not
[2:19:38] i've even pulled him off the altar and
[2:19:40] sat him down and talked to him a little
[2:19:41] while
[2:19:42] you're too close something's wrong well
[2:19:43] you're not open yet
[2:19:45] tell me what's going on with you i've
[2:19:48] had many of them say i just
[2:19:49] i'm here because i know i need to get
[2:19:51] right but i just don't think it's going
[2:19:53] to happen i said that's the reason you
[2:19:54] felt the way you felt whenever i laid my
[2:19:55] hands on you
[2:19:57] and then after talking to him a little
[2:19:58] while and quoting the bible to him a
[2:20:00] little while and
[2:20:01] explaining to him you're approaching it
[2:20:03] wrong
[2:20:07] friends if what brother brandon taught
[2:20:08] us is true about all the little doors in
[2:20:10] our heart
[2:20:11] then all we have to do and this goes for
[2:20:13] every christian and hear me included
[2:20:16] all we have to do is open up all them
[2:20:17] doors and say okay lord
[2:20:19] you have free access to every room
[2:20:24] in my heart god
[2:20:32] when you get there blessed are they
[2:20:37] that are poor in spirit

[2:20:51] here today
[2:20:54] i'm assuming the majority of you are
[2:20:56] probably already saved
[2:20:59] but that's just an assumption
[2:21:03] if there'd be somebody here this morning
[2:21:05] they'd like to say brother ben
[2:21:07] as i've heard the word go forth this
[2:21:09] morning
[2:21:11] my heart has smote me
[2:21:15] and i know i need to get right with god
[2:21:19] i know my life's not where it should be
[2:21:22] and i need to get right would you raise
[2:21:23] your hand to the lord so i might pray

[2:22:00] sitting not that i'm against it ought to
[2:22:03] call lord but

[2:22:09] may you move upon each one that had
[2:22:11] their hand raised

[2:22:20] their kitchen or their living room or
[2:22:22] their bedroom or whatever they might be
