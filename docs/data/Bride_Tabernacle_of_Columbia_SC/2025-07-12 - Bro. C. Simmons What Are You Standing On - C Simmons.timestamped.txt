[27:00] we get ready for the word tonight. Amen.
[27:04] Let us bow.
[27:07] Lord, we thank you for your solid rock,
[27:10] Lord Jesus. We ask that you just move in
[27:12] this place tonight. And Lord, just move

[27:44] Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[27:46] we'll turn to Matthew chapter
[27:49] Matthew chapter
[27:51] 7. Amen. And verse 24.
[28:16] [Music]
[28:21] Matthew 7 and 24. When you got it, say
[28:24] amen.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads,
[28:27] "Therefore, whosoever
[28:30] these things are of mine,
[28:34] and do with him, I will like him unto a
[28:36] wise man, which build which built his
[28:39] house upon a rock. And the rain
[28:42] descended, and the floods came, and the
[28:44] winds blew, and beat upon that house,
[28:47] and it fell not, for it was founded upon
[28:50] a rock." Amen. Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; And everyone that heareth these sayings
[28:54] of mine and doeth them not shall be
[28:57] likened unto a foolish man, which built
[29:00] his house upon the sand. And the rains
[29:03] descended, and the floods came, and the
[29:06] winds blew, and beat upon that house,
[29:09] and it fell, and great was the fall of
[29:12] it. Amen.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when Jesus had ended
[29:16] these sins, the people were astonished
[29:18] at all his doctrine. Amen. God bless the
[29:20] others prayer. You may be seated. Amen.
[29:24] Tonight, tonight I'd like to speak on a
[29:26] little topic that I entitled, "What are
[29:29] you standing on?" What are you standing
[29:32] on? And I read from the scripture
[29:33] because it was powerful because it's
[29:36] very important for you to understand
[29:39] what's what what you're standing on.
[29:42] It's very important for you to
[29:43] understand that what is your foundation
[29:46] because whatever you're building on in
[29:48] life, it has to start from a foundation.
[29:51] It has to be built upon something. And
[29:53] if you if you are unsure of what that
[29:55] something is, you you don't you you
[29:58] might be on sand. And when the winds and
[30:00] storms of life blow, it can wash you
[30:03] this way and wash you that way. And it
[30:05] may even crumble and fall. But tonight,
[30:07] I encourage you to make sure that you
[30:09] that whatever you're standing on, you're
[30:11] standing on a rock.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; And when you stand on this rock, you can
[30:15] stand firm and you can be assured in
[30:18] what you're standing on. You know that
[30:20] it's not going to shift to and fro. You
[30:22] know that when you stand on on this
[30:24] rock, it's not going to move. You know
[30:27] that when someone came and come and says
[30:29] this or that, you're not going to change
[30:31] because you're standing on something
[30:33] that's solid. You're standing on
[30:34] something that's firm that no matter
[30:36] which way the waters come and push that
[30:39] rock, it's not moving. No matter what
[30:41] comes against it, it's not moving
[30:43] because you're standing on that rock.
[30:46] And as long as you're standing upon the
[30:48] rock, you shall not be moved. As long as
[30:50] you're standing on that rock, there's
[30:52] nothing that can move you off of that
[30:54] foundation because you s you're standing
[30:57] on something that's solid that'll stand
[30:59] beyond the test of time, that'll stand
[31:01] until eternity. But you got to make sure
[31:04] that you're standing on the rock. But I
[31:06] asked the question, what are you
[31:08] standing on? Because some people are
[31:10] unsure. That's why it's easy for them to
[31:12] turn this way and turn that way. And you
[31:15] wonder why some people after many years
[31:18] they turn and they go this way or go
[31:19] that way. Well, I question where they
[31:21] standing on a rock.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Were they standing on the rock that
[31:25] shall not be moved? Were they standing
[31:27] on the rock that didn't change? the way
[31:29] they standing on the rock that said I'll
[31:31] be the same yesterday, today, and
[31:33] forever. Now, when you look through the
[31:35] scriptures,
[31:37] you you'll understand that who is the
[31:40] rock. And in 2 Samuel 22 and 32, it
[31:43] says, "For who is God and save the Lord?
[31:46] Who is a rock? Save our God." And in
[31:49] Psalms, he said, "For who is God save
[31:52] the Lord, and who is a rock save our
[31:54] God." Yes.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; In Psalm 62 and2 it says, "He only is my
[31:59] rock and my salvation. He is my defense
[32:02] and I shall not be greatly moved."
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:09] Psalms 18. I'll turn to there.
[32:21] Psalms 18 and verse one.
[32:34] You got to say amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "And I will love
[32:37] thee, oh Lord, my strength." But verse
[32:40] two, it says, "The Lord is my rock."
[32:43] See, David understood after all that
[32:46] that he had went through the where who
[32:48] his rock was. He understood that this
[32:51] was the rock that I need to be standing
[32:53] on. This is the thing that I need to be
[32:55] standing on. He said, "The Lord is my
[32:56] rock and my fortress and my deliverer."
[33:00] He understood while he was standing on
[33:02] that rock, he had deliverance. When he
[33:04] stood on that rock, he had victory. When
[33:06] he stood on that rock, there was nothing
[33:09] that could stand against him. No matter
[33:11] how high the waters of life may have
[33:13] tread against David, he understood where
[33:15] he stood. He understood that there was
[33:18] nobody could talk him off of this rock.
[33:20] There was no one that could talk him out
[33:22] of the God that had come and stood and
[33:24] was the rock cuz he understood his rock
[33:27] was Jesus. His rock was God. He
[33:29] understood that he was my God and my
[33:32] strength and in whom I will trust.
[33:34] That's what he said. My buckler and the
[33:36] horn of my salvation and my high tower.
[33:39] See, he understood what his rock was. It
[33:42] was more than just a rock. It was
[33:44] something that could keep him when he
[33:45] couldn't keep himself. It was something
[33:48] that would stand firm when he couldn't
[33:50] stand himself. It was something that
[33:51] would allow him to have victory when he
[33:54] shouldn't have had victory. It was
[33:55] something that would allow him to have
[33:57] overcoming power when he shouldn't have
[33:59] overcome
[34:00] &gt;&gt; because the rock was God. It was
[34:02] something that was greater than him. And
[34:04] Daniel, he he spoke the story about the
[34:07] if you read the scriptures in Daniel and
[34:09] he talked about there was a stone hun
[34:11] out of the mountain and it came and
[34:13] knocked down the statue. And when you
[34:15] read that story, you realize that there
[34:17] was something powerful about this rock.
[34:20] It was something that you might not have
[34:21] understood. But when when you go pick up
[34:24] a rock, you realize many of times if
[34:26] it's a real solid rock, you can't crush
[34:29] it. You can try as hard as you can. Get
[34:32] one about the size of your fist and try
[34:34] to try to squeeze it and see if you can
[34:36] break it.
[34:38] See see when you have a rock is
[34:40] something that's solid.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; And many people we get we are in a time
[34:45] in a in a thing that people are are are
[34:47] going after many things
[34:50] &gt;&gt; or people are searching in this day and
[34:52] age in what what do I believe in?
[34:55] &gt;&gt; What what what what do I what what what
[34:58] is going to be my foundation? And many
[35:01] of people that are coming up, they're
[35:02] not just accepting something because
[35:04] it's taught to them. And because we live
[35:06] in an age where there's so much
[35:08] visibility, we can see about many
[35:11] different things. All it takes is you
[35:13] typing in a question. There's AI to do
[35:16] the work for you now. So you don't even
[35:18] have to go and search website to
[35:20] website. It'll give you everything that
[35:21] you want about any subject, anything.
[35:24] And so you can go and search
[35:26] Christianity. You can go and search
[35:28] Hinduism. You can go and search Islam.
[35:31] You can go and search all these many
[35:32] things.
[35:34] But when you come down and you search
[35:36] it, there's many people that have
[35:37] searched it. But you realize there has
[35:39] to be something that you stand on.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; And there has to be something that you
[35:44] can turn to. And the reason that that
[35:47] some people can choose this or that.
[35:49] They have their many different reasons.
[35:52] But and sometimes it's a product of
[35:54] their environment, where they grow up
[35:56] and where they are. Pastor was preaching
[35:58] about that the other day and and he was
[36:01] talking and he was talking about it and
[36:03] I realized that sometimes that you have
[36:05] to you have to find what is going to be
[36:08] your foundation.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; What will you stand on? And each one of
[36:12] us have to come on that journey by
[36:14] oursel.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Each one of us have to come to that
[36:16] place by oursel. We can't stand on mama
[36:19] and daddy rock. We got to stand on our
[36:21] own. We got to realize what the rock is.
[36:24] We got to understand that we can turn to
[36:26] the rock when we have nowhere else to
[36:29] turn to. We got to understand that we
[36:31] got to make sure our house is on that
[36:33] firm foundation. That we stable on that
[36:36] firm foundation and that the even though
[36:38] the structure might be rickety, we
[36:40] realize that the foundation is solid.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes the winds and water blow
[36:45] and it'll blow down the structure, but
[36:47] it don't blow the foundation.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Because the foundation was solid. And
[36:51] sometimes God allow things to come
[36:53] that'll blow down your structure because
[36:55] he wants you to build a stronger
[36:57] structure. He wants you to build
[36:58] something that has a has a stronger he
[37:01] the foundation was right but the
[37:03] structure was wrong.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; So he allow you to go around and when
[37:08] the winds and blow it'll blow the
[37:09] structure but not the foundation because
[37:12] you got to get once you start building
[37:14] on that foundation and realizing what
[37:16] the foundation is you realize how to
[37:18] build on it. Many people, they got a
[37:20] foundation, but they're building the
[37:22] wrong structure on the foundation.
[37:24] They're not taking full advantage of the
[37:26] foundation. If you had a foundation and
[37:29] and the foundation was the size of this
[37:32] right here, right here, this tabletop,
[37:35] and I built something only on this side
[37:37] of this table, and I'm not taking full
[37:40] advantage of the rest of the space. So,
[37:42] God allowed to you to destroy this so he
[37:44] can build something bigger. He can build
[37:46] something greater. So you can take full
[37:48] advantage of everything that he gave to
[37:50] you.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; And when you realize how big your
[37:52] foundation is, you can realize that
[37:54] everything that he gave unto Adam, he
[37:57] gave unto you. And you realize that this
[37:59] foundation was greater than I thought it
[38:01] was. This rock that I'm standing on is
[38:03] the rock that has the power of of life
[38:06] and death. He has the power of
[38:08] everything. And he said, I given it unto
[38:10] you. But if you never realize what he's
[38:13] given unto you, you'll never build upon
[38:15] it. You'll never say, "Lord, I take it
[38:18] at your word and I believe what you said
[38:20] and I can stand on it. I can stand on
[38:22] this and I can stand on what you've
[38:24] given me cuz this rock right here is
[38:26] solid and it ain't going to move. And I
[38:28] know that I tried it and I tested and I
[38:31] found out for myself that it it's a
[38:33] solid rock. It's a rock that I can when
[38:36] you leave me there, I don't have to move
[38:38] off of it because it's solid. I don't
[38:40] have to go nowhere because it's a solid
[38:42] rock.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, he said, "And
[38:47] tonight, maybe cancer has conquered you.
[38:50] Maybe something else has taken a hold of
[38:52] you. Some disease, even even the disease
[38:54] of sin or whatever it is, it may look
[38:57] dark or gloomy to you now, but may look
[39:00] like you'll never recover." See,
[39:02] sometimes the devil will get you to a
[39:04] place that you will think that you'll
[39:05] never recover.
[39:07] He'll take you to a spot and get you so
[39:10] entangled in your mind and you deal with
[39:12] the year after year that you'll think
[39:14] that you'll never recover. He said maybe
[39:17] look like you can't get over that that
[39:20] prostate trouble or that lung trouble,
[39:22] whatever it is, that tumor, that
[39:23] crippling condition. The doctor may say
[39:26] every hope is gone. But standing right
[39:29] by your side tonight, right, ready to
[39:32] take you in possession, stands the eyes
[39:35] of faith who sees the victory yonder
[39:37] through the Lord Jesus Christ. Away from
[39:40] Satan and his gloom and up with faith in
[39:42] the Lord Jesus Christ, the faith of
[39:45] almighty God.
[39:49] See, faith can take its holy stand on
[39:52] the rock of ages. Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Said faith can take its holy stand on on
[39:57] the rock of ages and pierce an eagle's
[39:59] eye through every storm cloud when the
[40:02] very waves of death and disappointments
[40:04] tries to wash the foundation from under
[40:06] you. Said sometimes God sometimes it'll
[40:11] be disappointment that'll try to wash
[40:13] the foundation from under you. Sometimes
[40:16] the it's the waves of death that tries
[40:19] to wash it and says it can stand there
[40:22] and look beyond the the skies and say
[40:24] God is right.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; And believe the counsel of the wise and
[40:28] the living God. It said it can look
[40:30] beyond the skies and say God is right.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Many people struggle with something with
[40:36] they struggle with with believing in God
[40:40] is because they can't see him.
[40:42] But the only way to see God is to have
[40:44] faith in God.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; The only way to see God is to believe in
[40:48] him and have faith and see what he'll
[40:51] do. And by the by his many works, you
[40:54] can testify that there is a God. By his
[40:57] many works, you can testify that God is
[40:59] real. By his many works, you can say, I
[41:02] can only see that you're standing on the
[41:04] rock by the manifestations of what it
[41:06] produces. said, "I can only understand
[41:09] that you're standing there by faith is
[41:11] by the manifestation of what it
[41:12] produces." And when you see what it
[41:14] produces, you can realize that that
[41:16] person has faith. You can realize that
[41:18] that person believes in something that's
[41:20] greater than them. You can realize that
[41:22] they believe in a God that's real. And
[41:24] it might not be real to you, but it's
[41:26] real to me. And I don't have to
[41:28] understand to believe that you serve a
[41:30] real and a true and a living God. Amen.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Say, even even the devil believes in
[41:36] God, but he trembles. If the devil can
[41:38] believe in him, why can't you? Why can't
[41:41] everyone believe in a God if the devil
[41:43] can?
[41:44] &gt;&gt; See, the difference is the devil has
[41:46] seen God.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; We might not have, but he has. So he he
[41:51] knows that God is real. And said if he
[41:53] knows that God is real, it should give
[41:55] you encouragement for you to continue to
[41:57] believe. It should give you
[41:59] encouragement to continue to walk on in
[42:01] faith and say, "I want to see the God
[42:03] that created me. I want to get to a
[42:05] point that I do the right things that I
[42:07] can see that God."
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Said, "There's only things that I have
[42:11] to do. The God he positioned in his word
[42:14] that if I believe and I trust in him and
[42:16] I do the steps that he provided for me,
[42:18] I can one day see him."
[42:21] And when I see them, I you don't know
[42:22] what may happen, but I know that there's
[42:24] a sound of joy. There's a sound of
[42:26] victory. There's a sound of rejoicing
[42:29] that's happening there
[42:32] &gt;&gt; because that's what God wants. He always
[42:34] wanted. That's why he created you and
[42:36] me. So that we can praise him. So that
[42:38] we can give him glory, give him honor.
[42:41] And so Lord, I thank you for the rock
[42:42] that you created. Lord, I thank you that
[42:45] I'm able to stand on my firm foundation.
[42:47] Lord, I thank you that I'm able to move
[42:49] and I can I can give you glory, give you
[42:52] honor, give you praise
[42:55] &gt;&gt; because I can testify that God is real.
[42:58] I can testify that the rock that I'm
[43:00] standing on is greater than anything
[43:02] that you can stand on. I can testify
[43:05] that Jesus is the rock that I'm standing
[43:07] on and that he can move and he can
[43:09] deliver. He can save. He can set free.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; See, I'm a living testament of what God
[43:15] can do.
[43:17] Lord.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; And even if he ain't done it yet, he's
[43:20] still in the process of doing it. And
[43:22] even if I don't ever see him do it, I
[43:25] know that he's still able to do it. See,
[43:27] that's the God that I'm standing on. I'm
[43:30] standing right there only because my
[43:31] faith is elevated. I can see beyond the
[43:34] clouds. I can see beyond the storm. And
[43:36] I can see that God is the one that's
[43:38] going to deliver. God is the one that
[43:40] are set free. God is the one that'll do
[43:43] the impossible. All I have to do is
[43:45] believe.
[43:48] See, I understand what I'm standing on
[43:50] now.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; See, that's why some people can shout
[43:53] even on the down days. That's why some
[43:55] people can give God praise even when
[43:57] they going through the storm because
[43:59] they had the faith that God is going to
[44:01] deliver me. They understand what they're
[44:03] standing on. They're not shaken by the
[44:06] winds. They're not shaken by the storms.
[44:08] They're not shaken by the trials and
[44:10] tribulation cuz they understand what
[44:12] they're standing on.
[44:14] They're standing on a God that's real.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; They're standing on a God that can do
[44:19] the impossible. They're standing on a
[44:21] God that all I have to do is have faith
[44:23] in him. All I have to do is believe and
[44:25] he can do what I ask above all that I
[44:28] ask or think. That's the God that I
[44:30] serve.
[44:32] That's why I serve him. That's why I
[44:34] don't have a problem serving him. That's
[44:36] why I love him and I don't have a
[44:38] problem telling people that I love God.
[44:40] I serve God. I serve a real and a living
[44:43] God.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; See, after that, you can have a
[44:48] testimony. People don't have to wonder
[44:50] and you don't have to question it
[44:52] because you you're standing on something
[44:54] that's greater than you ever imagined.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; So, when you come to that place, you can
[45:01] you can you're able to witness. You're
[45:03] able to tell somebody else cuz you
[45:05] understand what you're standing on.
[45:08] You're not afraid to go out and tell
[45:09] somebody, "Hey, there's a real God.
[45:11] There's a Jesus that came and died for
[45:14] my sins, that died for your sins, that
[45:16] died on a cross and shed his blood."
[45:19] &gt;&gt; See, that's the God that I serve.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; I said, "When you understand what you're
[45:24] standing on, you can have victory.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; You can have power. You can have faith.
[45:29] You can you can you can go in there with
[45:31] confidence. Not if your confidence and
[45:34] your ability, nor anything that you can
[45:36] do, but believe in the God that's inside
[45:38] of you will bring you through anything
[45:40] that you may go through.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; See, it's not anything we could have
[45:46] done. Not anything we could have said,
[45:48] but God chose us before the foundation
[45:50] of the world. He saw our end from the
[45:52] beginning and realized, you know what?
[45:54] That's going to be my son. That's going
[45:56] to be my daughter. That's going to be my
[45:58] king. That's going to be my prince.
[46:00] That's going to be my queen. That's he
[46:02] decided that before the foundation of
[46:04] the world. And when you realize it, you
[46:06] can stand on that foundation
[46:09] &gt;&gt; and you can be uplifted out of the
[46:10] things that you may be going through.
[46:13] You can come out of it. You can open
[46:14] your eyes. Just like God opened the eyes
[46:17] of the servant to see that God was all
[46:19] around him. Even though the enemy was
[46:22] closer to him, God was still out there.
[46:24] He was all around the enemy. And there
[46:26] wasn't nothing the enemy could do about
[46:28] it. is is is mindful that God opened his
[46:32] eyes and when he gave Elijah and them
[46:34] deliverance, he told Elijah to go out
[46:37] there and he blinded each one of their
[46:39] eyes. He blinded the enemy's eyes and
[46:42] Elijah let him down. I believe the story
[46:44] went he led him down to another city and
[46:47] he put all and he put the enemy right in
[46:49] the middle of all the all of God's
[46:52] people and then he opened their eyes and
[46:54] they saw that they were surrounded.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:57] And then at that point, they didn't kill
[47:00] him. They they said, "You know what? We
[47:02] we we want peace now." And see,
[47:05] sometimes the Lord has to open your eyes
[47:07] and realize what you're going through is
[47:10] just a moment. And when you are able to
[47:11] see,
[47:13] &gt;&gt; when you're able to see, the devil
[47:15] realized that now you can see, he leaves
[47:17] you alone.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; It wasn't nothing. It wasn't that it it
[47:22] wasn't even the the devil said, "You
[47:23] know what? I was only bothering them
[47:25] because they couldn't see. God only
[47:27] allowed you to go through it because you
[47:28] couldn't see. That he was trying to get
[47:30] you to open your eyes that you may see
[47:32] that what what you're going through is
[47:34] not greater than me.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; That what you're going through is not
[47:38] greater than me. And once you realize
[47:41] that that and your eyes become open that
[47:43] oh I got it now. It becomes a revelation
[47:47] to you. It's something that hey, nobody
[47:50] can take from you now. No matter how
[47:52] many people told Buddy Ryan that he was
[47:54] he couldn't see, there wasn't nothing
[47:56] that anybody could tell him because he
[47:58] stood on it.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; He realized that this is something that
[48:01] I stand on. It became a revelation to
[48:03] him. And when something becomes a
[48:05] revelation to you, no matter how many
[48:07] people try to talk you out of it, they
[48:09] can't tell you nothing different. That's
[48:11] right.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; No matter how much it may seem to you
[48:14] that things are going in the opposite
[48:16] direction of what you confess, doesn't
[48:18] mean that your confession doesn't hold
[48:20] weight. It doesn't mean that what you
[48:22] confess is not going to happen. All you
[48:24] have to do is continue to stand on it
[48:26] and stand on it. And when those that
[48:29] that don't believe, if it's God's word,
[48:31] you can stand on it. And you can keep
[48:33] standing on it. And you can keep
[48:35] standing on it because that's a
[48:36] foundation that'll never crumble. That's
[48:39] a foundation that'll never move. That's
[48:41] a foundation that'll stay in firm
[48:43] through the end of times. Yeah.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And and it's something that if God's
[48:48] word go out of his mouth, it can't
[48:50] return into him void.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; I said once you realize what you're
[48:54] standing on and the and the thing that
[48:56] you're standing on is the word that he
[48:58] gave you. If you're standing on that
[49:00] word, there's nothing that can move you.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; And you can believe in that word and
[49:05] stand firm on that word until the end of
[49:07] time. Whether you go in the ground or
[49:09] whether he takes us out of here, you can
[49:11] stand on that word and realize that's
[49:13] the only source of truth that's out
[49:15] there. It's the only thing that'll give
[49:17] you the source of truth that you might
[49:19] be looking for. And you search for and
[49:21] people search all their lives trying to
[49:23] find one thing that they can stand on.
[49:26] But when you stand on the word of God,
[49:28] you realize there's nothing that can
[49:30] defeat you. There's nothing that'll come
[49:32] against you that you can't overcome.
[49:34] There's nothing that will come before
[49:36] you that God won't give you victory
[49:38] over. There's nothing that that'll stand
[49:41] in your way.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; And God God used those things to for you
[49:46] to be a testimony. He'll use those
[49:48] things that give you gifts and give you
[49:50] callings and allow you to be a testament
[49:53] that you know there is a real and a
[49:55] living God. Just like the woman at the
[49:57] well when something happened inside of
[49:59] her and she got a she got on that on
[50:02] that firm foundation that it became a
[50:04] revelation that she said come see a man
[50:07] that told me all that I was see when
[50:09] when she got that revelation that this
[50:12] was this was the living God and she she
[50:14] ran back and told everyone and it wasn't
[50:17] anything it wasn't the words that she
[50:19] said but people saw and knew that
[50:21] something had changed. It wasn't
[50:23] necessarily the words that she said, but
[50:25] she said it and she was a living,
[50:27] walking, breathing testimony of what God
[50:29] can do.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; And said, when you understand the
[50:34] foundation that you're standing on, the
[50:36] confidence that you can have is totally
[50:38] different. You walk into things and you
[50:40] realize that things are not as big as
[50:42] they seem. Things are not as grand as
[50:45] they seem. This is only a test that I'm
[50:47] going through. And when I get through
[50:49] it, it might be another one and another
[50:51] one. But God that brought me through
[50:52] this one's going to take me through that
[50:54] one. And then when I get through that
[50:56] one, he's going to take me through that
[50:57] one. As long as I live, I'm going to
[50:59] have tests and trials. But the key is I
[51:01] understand what I'm standing on. I
[51:04] understand the foundation that I'm
[51:06] standing on. I understand that God is a
[51:08] God that is able to do exceedingly
[51:11] abundantly more than I ask or think. And
[51:13] when I get on there and I realize that I
[51:15] can come through it, I can shout the
[51:18] victory through it. I can walk through
[51:19] it. And I can say, Lord, to God be the
[51:22] glory for all the things that he's done.
[51:25] Lord, I can say to God be the glory that
[51:27] he delivered me, that he gave me
[51:29] victory. That the things that the devil
[51:31] tried to put on me, I didn't accept
[51:33] them, I sent them back. And the things
[51:35] that he tried to give me, I sent them
[51:37] back to him. I gave it back to him cuz
[51:40] my God didn't give me that. He gave me
[51:42] love, joy, peace, perfect holiness. He
[51:46] gave me these things and I can shout the
[51:48] victory. I can lift my hands and say,
[51:50] "Thank you, Jesus." I can say, "Lord, I
[51:52] understand what I'm standing on. I
[51:55] understand you gave me my foundation,
[51:57] and I'm standing on it." Amen.
[52:00] [Applause]
[52:04] [Music]
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:18] Lord Jesus.
[52:20] [Music]
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Lord,
[52:24] [Applause]
[52:25] [Music]
