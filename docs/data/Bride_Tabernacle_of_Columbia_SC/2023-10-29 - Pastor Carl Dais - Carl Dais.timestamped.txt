[42:09] morning bless your word this morning let

[42:17] way that Lord will be like those on the

[42:24] burn within us as he spoke to us along

[42:29] bless your word bless your pastor
[42:32] brother
[42:33] Caleb have your way this morning bless
[42:35] each and every visitor and friend saints
[42:38] of God come to hear your word I pray you
[42:41] feel their needs this morning and their
[42:43] desires for we love you now in Jesus
[42:46] name
[42:48] amen as we
[42:53] stand the book of Romans
[43:11] 10 Romans
[43:14] 10 try not to be too long this
[43:18] morning Romans 10 and N if you have it
[43:21] say
[43:25] Amen
[43:28] the scripture
[43:30] says that if Thou shalt confess with thy
[43:32] mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in
[43:35] thine heart that God has raised him from
[43:37] the dead Thou shalt be
[43:39] saved for with the heart man believeth
[43:41] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[43:44] confession is made unto
[43:46] salvation may the Lord add a blessing to
[43:49] the reading of where you may be
[43:51] seated I thought this morning have faith
[43:57] in
[43:58] God have
[44:00] faith in God now we know faith is a
[44:04] funny
[44:05] thing cuz sometime people think they got
[44:08] faith and they don't have it and
[44:10] sometime they have faith and they don't
[44:12] have it so when you look at Faith it's a
[44:16] firm
[44:18] persuasion the scriptures that you read
[44:21] and that you study and you pray it
[44:24] confirms your ID ity in
[44:27] God so when your faith is
[44:32] tested is tested to a point where God
[44:36] said I'm going to see whether you have
[44:38] faith today so he'll sent a sickness or
[44:40] sent a situation and he'll see what you
[44:42] got now Romans 10:9 said if Thou shalt
[44:45] confess with thy mouth confessing with
[44:48] the mouth and believing thine heart so
[44:51] the confession that you make with your
[44:53] mouth you must believe it in your heart
[44:55] heart so you just can't be just saying
[44:57] something there must be faith in what
[45:00] you say it must go deeper and penetrate
[45:04] into the heart because the devil is
[45:07] going to try you he's going to test your
[45:10] faith in what you
[45:12] believe if you say I got faith in God
[45:15] and I said Lord you know you got faith
[45:17] he's going to test it amen he's going to
[45:19] test your faith St John
[45:24] 1 St John 1 and
[45:37] 43 and it says the day following Jesus
[45:40] would go forth into Galilee and findeth
[45:49] Phillip and sa unto him follow me now
[45:53] Philip was a Bethesda the city of Andrew
[45:56] and Peter and Philip finding nathon said
[45:59] unto him we found we found him of whom
[46:02] Moses in the law and the prophets did
[46:04] right Jesus of
[46:06] Nazareth and the son of Joseph the son
[46:09] of Joseph Nathaniel said unto him can
[46:11] there any good thing come out of
[46:14] Nazareth and philli said unto him come
[46:16] and
[46:17] see and Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to
[46:21] him and said unto him behold an
[46:23] Israelite in whom there's no God
[46:27] so Nathaniel began to say some things
[46:29] about Jesus and didn't know Jesus was in
[46:32] his
[46:33] midst and Nathaniel said unto him which
[46:36] knowest thou me and Jesus answered and
[46:38] said unto him before Philip called thee
[46:40] when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw
[46:43] thee how about this morning God sees
[46:46] every one of you and I when we got up to
[46:49] put on our clothes God knew that we
[46:52] whether we come to church for Faith or
[46:54] whether we come to church for to cause
[46:57] confusion or we come to church to be the
[47:00] same or we come to church because we got
[47:02] something nice to wear a nice hat or
[47:05] something but he knows these things so
[47:08] he begin to talk to Nathaniel and begin
[47:12] to Nathaniel didn't know that Jesus
[47:14] knows
[47:16] everything as you sitting in your seat
[47:19] this morning Jesus knows your
[47:22] heart he knows your motives and
[47:24] objectives for being here this morning
[47:26] am whether I want to come and hear what
[47:29] the preachers say oh sin born man from
[47:31] remit preaching in Camden ain't much I
[47:34] got to say with what Jesus tell
[47:36] me see what I'm saying you come to see
[47:40] Jesus and I believe you'll get what you
[47:43] expect if you come to see him this
[47:45] morning
[47:46] amen I had Bible study with my mom last
[47:49] night about 2 hours I couldn't make it
[47:51] to the service
[47:53] brother what's brother Armstrong I said
[47:55] M I can't make it cuz I got to be with
[47:57] you tonight so we going to have Bible
[47:59] study we went over about 10 chapters in
[48:01] Proverbs then I begin to take over my
[48:03] sermon last night she said Son you don't
[48:06] W me out and I pray for us and our faith
[48:08] is the substance of things hope for us
[48:10] the evidence of Things Not Seen I said
[48:12] now your sickness can be brought subject
[48:14] to Faith I said all it take is a
[48:16] combustion chamber of anointing and you
[48:19] can walk out of your condition but it
[48:22] takes real Faith see Faith knows no
[48:24] defeat Faith Knows No Death Faith
[48:30] overcomes when we can climb down in
[48:33] faith faith knows no defeat Faith knows
[48:37] no enemy why because Faith overcomes
[48:41] amen now look what Nathaniel said
[48:44] Nathaniel verse 48 Nathaniel said unto
[48:47] him which knowest thou me Jesus answered
[48:49] and said him before Philip called thee
[48:51] when I was under the Fig Tree I saw thee
[48:54] and naani answered and said unto to him
[48:56] Rabbi th the Son of God th the king of
[48:59] Israel and Jesus answered and said unto
[49:00] him because I said unto thee I saw thee
[49:04] under the Fig Tree believest thou Thou
[49:07] shalt see greater things than these and
[49:09] he said unto him verely very I say unto
[49:11] you Hereafter you should see Heavens
[49:14] open and the angel of God ascending and
[49:17] descending upon the son of man so now
[49:20] Nathaniel said one thing and he said
[49:22] Rabbi now Jesus begin to tell him some
[49:24] little deeper things see Jesus want to
[49:27] take our faith into some deeper things
[49:29] he let sickness come he let all these
[49:31] troubles come in our life that Faith to
[49:34] rise up and say Lord I'm taking you at
[49:36] your word I'm taking you at your promise
[49:40] amen amen amen acts
[49:47] 4 acts 4 and
[49:51] seven now we know
[49:54] faith
[49:56] faith is right there it's
[50:00] now Faith is now for you and I
[50:04] that's so right now when you hear the
[50:07] word faith is now yes and you grab hold
[50:11] of that one word appreciate Wayne being
[50:13] here this
[50:14] morning now
[50:17] Faith it's Faith right now I said Ma
[50:19] just catch hold to one word amen one
[50:23] word that I'm saying and you ain't
[50:25] caught hold to your son you caught hold
[50:28] to Faith amen it's just one word in that
[50:31] scripture will ignite your faith and you
[50:33] can move into the promises of God one
[50:36] word catches your faith and ignites you
[50:39] and now you can walk out of your
[50:42] situation you can walk out of your
[50:44] condition it just take one word but it
[50:47] takes meditation and thinking on your
[50:49] mind just can't be everywhere you know
[50:50] some people come in church in their mind
[50:52] everywhere snap out of it you in the
[50:54] presence of Jes Jesus Christ you're in
[50:57] the presence of the mighty king this
[50:58] morning we all eyes no big eyes and
[51:01] little you we are all on this
[51:03] road as brother Dwayne said two weeks
[51:06] ago it's a way it ain't a highway it's a
[51:08] way that's called Holiness and the way
[51:11] should be called Holiness Holiness or I
[51:14] won't say the other
[51:17] part acts 4 and
[51:22] S and he says and when they had
[51:25] set them in the midst they asked by what
[51:29] power or by what name have you done this
[51:34] Oh Glory to God by what power or by what
[51:38] name have you done this what did they do
[51:41] let's look at it what did they do then
[51:45] Peter filled with what the Holy Ghost he
[51:48] had done got his faith to the point
[51:49] where God recognized his faith and
[51:51] filled him with the Holy Ghost see you
[51:54] ain't even a Christian until you you
[51:55] feel then you on your road to fight see
[51:59] the devil got you until you're filled
[52:00] with the Holy Ghost he and then say then
[52:03] he said uh then Peter filled the Holy
[52:05] Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the
[52:07] people and Elders of what Israel so he
[52:10] was talking to everybody now now let's
[52:13] backtrack just a little bit before Jesus
[52:15] left he cursed and swear that he didn't
[52:18] know Jesus the lady said you was with
[52:20] the Jesus and the disciples he said I I
[52:23] wasn't with him Bo he was in a terrible
[52:25] shape but now over here when the day of
[52:28] Pentecost come look what he's
[52:30] saying this look what he says Israel and
[52:32] the name of Jes for be it known unto you
[52:35] all and all the people of Israel that by
[52:37] the name of who Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[52:41] whom ye crucified whom God raised from
[52:43] the dead even by him doeth this man
[52:46] stand before
[52:48] youold this is the stone which was set
[52:50] at not of you Builders which has become
[52:52] the head of the
[52:53] corner neither is there salvation in any
[52:56] other for there's none other name under
[52:58] heaven give among men whereby you must
[53:00] be saved see that's why I was telling my
[53:01] mom last night I said the name of Jesus
[53:04] that's when you calling on the name of
[53:05] Jesus there's power in the name of Jesus
[53:08] there's victory in the name of Jesus and
[53:10] if you got faith this morning you'll
[53:12] call on the name of Jesus and say Lord
[53:14] I'm looking for a blessing this morning
[53:16] I'm looking for something this morning
[53:18] and Lord it can't be straighten except
[53:20] it be accomplished in my life I'm
[53:22] looking for Faith this morning and the
[53:24] faith that was once delivered to the
[53:26] Saints I need it here with me this
[53:28] morning I need the supernatural to take
[53:30] place I need the power of God to take
[53:33] place I got conditions I got situations
[53:36] I got problems I need Jesus to come on
[53:39] the scene and meet my request and you
[53:42] stay there until it's conquered under
[53:45] you that's the kind of faith it is the
[53:48] Bible said Abraham staggered not at the
[53:50] promises of God through unbelief but was
[53:52] strong in faith giving glory to God he
[53:54] wait 25 years for the promised son and
[53:58] the Bible said he staggered not as he
[54:00] grow older he got stronger in
[54:05] faith he got stronger in faith so
[54:08] sometimes your condition might get
[54:11] worse your situation or diabetes or
[54:14] heart trouble might get worse it doesn't
[54:16] show that God ain't with you it just
[54:18] shows he's looking at your faith and
[54:20] seeing where you can go I want to trust
[54:24] God amen the Bible said they were well
[54:27] old and well stricken in age and it
[54:30] ceased to be after the manner of six
[54:34] amen but the Bible says in Romans 4:19
[54:37] he staggered not at the promises of God
[54:40] Amen but was strong in faith giving
[54:42] glory to God Abraham called those things
[54:45] as though they were and what happened
[54:48] they walked into their body change why
[54:50] we know that cuz aex said I want her
[54:53] amen she the most beautiful woman in any
[54:55] country the king wanted her so this
[54:58] morning your faith can walk you out of
[55:00] your condition into the very Promises of
[55:02] God faith knows no defeat it know it
[55:06] don't even know death why because Jesus
[55:08] raised Lazarus from the dead even if you
[55:10] dead God can bring you back glory to God
[55:13] and you ain't dead you just
[55:19] sleeping then he
[55:24] says
[55:26] crucified whom you whom God raised from
[55:28] the dead even by this man stand here
[55:30] before you hold this is the stone which
[55:33] is set at all of you Builders which is
[55:35] become the head of the corner neither is
[55:37] there salvation in any other but there's
[55:39] none other name under heaven whereby you
[55:41] must be the saved now let's go back to
[55:43] acts three almost the same page 3 and 12
[55:47] he said when Peter
[55:50] saw it and answered unto the people ye
[55:54] men of Israel
[55:55] why Marvel you at this or why you look
[55:58] so earnestly on us as though by our own
[56:01] power or Holiness we've made this man to
[56:04] walk the god of Abraham the god of Isaac
[56:06] the god of Jacob the god of our fathers
[56:08] have glorified his son Jesus whom you
[56:10] delivered up and denied in the presence
[56:13] of pilate I'm wondering this morning is
[56:15] anybody denying
[56:17] him you might say in your heart I'm not
[56:19] denying him but your actions prove that
[56:21] you're denying him your actions prove
[56:23] that you're living just like the Dev
[56:26] you're the devil's brother or the
[56:28] Devil's sister you living just like him
[56:30] but you want the pre the blessings of
[56:32] God glory to Jesus I told the guys at
[56:36] work the management and everything in
[56:37] the managers meeting I said let me tell
[56:38] you
[56:39] something there's two things that I
[56:41] don't agree with if you doing the same
[56:45] thing you doing every day and you're
[56:47] looking for a different result it ain't
[56:49] going to work
[56:50] am you come in his job and do the same
[56:54] thing and you looking for a different
[56:55] result you're living like the devil and
[56:57] you say Lord I need your healing I got
[57:00] diabetes I got heart trouble I got all
[57:02] this but you're still watching more TV
[57:05] than the
[57:06] television sometimes it's watching you
[57:08] at night I go upstairs and turn my son
[57:11] on all his is watching him am I wake him
[57:13] I said you you watching the TV said yeah
[57:15] Dad I said no he watching
[57:17] you you see we doing everything and we
[57:22] asking for God to do something for us we
[57:25] ask him for faith in our lives but we
[57:27] want to run up and down to every store
[57:30] instead of get on our knees and pray and
[57:33] call on the name of God but still yet at
[57:35] the end of the day we said Lord it a't I
[57:37] still got this situation I still got
[57:39] this condition you know sometime people
[57:42] stay in the barber shop in the hapl
[57:43] longer than they
[57:45] pray that's what it is we got to examine
[57:48] what we doing we got to examine what
[57:51] we're doing the Lord got me you in the
[57:53] you in you in you in the garden long
[57:54] than you praying had to cut my time back
[57:58] said God some the God and have a lot of
[57:59] problems in you know a lot of weeds got
[58:02] to get them out but I got to pray more
[58:04] than what I mean to God see if you're
[58:05] doing anything that you're doing more
[58:07] than God then you got a problem I don't
[58:09] care what it is where it is how you
[58:11] doing it if you're doing that more than
[58:13] you doing God then you got a problem now
[58:15] look what he says you have denied him in
[58:17] the presence of PID when he was
[58:20] determined to let him
[58:22] go the Prince of Life and the prince
[58:24] Prince of death they denied the Prince
[58:27] of Life which was Jesus Christ and they
[58:29] took Barabas a murderer and he killed he
[58:33] he he was put in jail cuz it was a
[58:35] robber and then in jail he killed
[58:37] someone in the
[58:38] Insurrection you see they chose the
[58:41] Prince of Life and this morning if your
[58:43] prayer life ain't where it's supposed to
[58:45] be you you choosing the prince of
[58:48] death cuz Faith is the victory the Bible
[58:51] say you can't even please God without
[58:54] faith that's that's what Romans 10:9 say
[58:56] if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[58:57] Lord Jesus and believe in thine heart
[58:59] that God has raised him from the dead
[59:01] thou shal be saved so with the heart man
[59:04] believeth and with the heart confession
[59:06] is made unto salvation glory to Jesus
[59:10] when your feet climb down into the
[59:13] promises of God and grab a hold of Faith
[59:16] you can say Lord I got you Lord I got
[59:19] faith now deceptions of things H for I
[59:22] got deceptions of faith and you can walk
[59:24] out knowing that it's conquered under
[59:26] you amen yes you've denied
[59:30] him in the presence of pilate when he
[59:33] was determined to let him go but ye
[59:35] denied the Holy One the just and desired
[59:38] a murderer to be granted unto you and
[59:40] killed the Prince of Life whom God
[59:43] raised from the dead whereof we Are
[59:45] Witnesses and his name and through faith
[59:49] in his name has made this man strong
[59:52] when ye whom you now see and hear ye the
[59:56] faith which by him which given him this
[59:58] perfect soundness in the presence of you
[1:00:00] all amen see God will give you soundness
[1:00:03] he'll give you peace amen he'll give you
[1:00:05] what you desire this morning but it must
[1:00:08] be according to his Scriptures it must
[1:00:10] be according to his word
[1:00:14] am John 4 and
[1:00:20] 11 see sometimes we can do things
[1:00:30] the Bible said
[1:00:32] that Peter them after they took
[1:00:36] Jesus they went
[1:00:38] fishing and the Bible say they tall all
[1:00:41] night and taking nothing see sometime we
[1:00:45] can pray all night but we don't let
[1:00:47] Jesus come in cuz we doing it on our own
[1:00:51] ability yes we can pray but Esau prayed
[1:00:54] too and find no way for repentance even
[1:00:58] though he sought it carefully the Bible
[1:00:59] says with tears yes he prayed and he had
[1:01:03] tears but he didn't sort it carefully
[1:01:05] you see what I'm saying he did not enter
[1:01:07] into that realm and when your prayer
[1:01:09] life get to a point you enter in I told
[1:01:12] the Saints in Canon I when you enter
[1:01:13] into that presence in
[1:01:16] prayer you ain't praying no more amen
[1:01:20] it's what worship you're not praying
[1:01:24] anymore
[1:01:25] once you have entered in through your
[1:01:26] prayer it's not prayer no more it's
[1:01:29] worship now cuz now you've entered into
[1:01:32] a real as they call it the most holy
[1:01:35] place you've entered there now and it's
[1:01:37] worship he's speaking to you and you
[1:01:39] speaking back to him so now you've
[1:01:42] create a spirit of worship that now God
[1:01:45] has honored your prayers he pulls you
[1:01:47] into the Shak Glory of worship yes amen
[1:01:51] see anybody can pray for hours but when
[1:01:53] you enter in
[1:01:55] when you get to a place you can enter in
[1:01:57] that's what they did at the day of
[1:01:58] Pentecost they was in one card in one
[1:02:01] mind and they entered into true worship
[1:02:05] amen so why did Esau he sought it
[1:02:08] carefully with tears but he couldn't
[1:02:10] enter in Judas he cast out Devils he
[1:02:14] done all these things but he couldn't
[1:02:16] enter in what was going on it was
[1:02:19] representation by predestination you've
[1:02:22] been predestinated before the found
[1:02:24] found of the world to enter into the
[1:02:26] most holy place and that's what produces
[1:02:30] perfectness that's what produces perfect
[1:02:34] Faith that's what I'm working with the
[1:02:36] church on the position of a Believer see
[1:02:39] the position of a be justification you
[1:02:41] still in the outer courts sanctification
[1:02:44] yes you moved into the inner court with
[1:02:45] the Brazen ARA and the lava but now
[1:02:47] we're going into the most holy place and
[1:02:49] the Bible says in Hebrews 10 Jesus
[1:02:52] rented the veil in TW from top to bottom
[1:02:54] Glory so now the most holy place is not
[1:02:57] where Israel is it's where you are going
[1:03:00] amen when you go in prayer and you enter
[1:03:03] that place you are entering in as a
[1:03:06] priest a king glory to God why the Bible
[1:03:11] says in Hebrews in Revelation he now
[1:03:14] made you you Kings and
[1:03:20] Priests the Bible said he rent the veil
[1:03:23] in from top to bottom so now you don't
[1:03:27] need the priest to go into the holy
[1:03:28] place with you the most holy place you
[1:03:30] can enter there by your prayer into that
[1:03:33] most holy place and how do you enter
[1:03:35] that by continual consecration dying out
[1:03:38] to self don't let the devil use you
[1:03:41] anger beig backbiting hatred jealousy
[1:03:44] you enter in there by the blood of
[1:03:48] Jesus and the blood of Jesus not the
[1:03:51] chemistry but the life that was in the
[1:03:54] blood
[1:03:54] changes your nature and now you are the
[1:03:58] presence and walking Tabernacle
[1:04:01] manifestation of
[1:04:04] Christ Christ means the anointed one and
[1:04:07] you are the anointed one why cuz he's
[1:04:10] made you Kings cuz you got a dominion
[1:04:13] and he made you priests cuz you tired at
[1:04:15] the paps for service the priest is tied
[1:04:19] for service and what service you are in
[1:04:21] your prayer life ushers you in into the
[1:04:24] presence of the mighty king we'll get
[1:04:27] into it hold on glory to God John 4 And1
[1:04:32] now this lady in John 4 she went from
[1:04:36] justification a sinner to justification
[1:04:39] into the most holy Place why cuz the
[1:04:41] Bible say she run in the city and told
[1:04:43] all that told her come see this man she
[1:04:47] was a
[1:04:48] prostitute so I wonder what nature she
[1:04:53] had I wonder what nature she had being a
[1:04:57] prostitute five six husbands and the one
[1:05:01] she met Jesus he changed her nature
[1:05:04] watch the scriptures watch the
[1:05:06] scriptures unfold for this woman that
[1:05:09] was predestinated by God in the kingdom
[1:05:12] of
[1:05:17] God 10 Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:05:20] if thou knewest the gift of God and who
[1:05:23] it is that said to to me give me a drink
[1:05:26] th would have asked of him and he would
[1:05:29] have given the living water thank you

[1:05:49] and drank thereof himself and his
[1:05:51] children and his cattle he never said
[1:05:55] anything to denounce Jacob's will cuz he
[1:06:00] know there's still people going to
[1:06:02] Jacob's wh that was going to be Conor
[1:06:05] that's going to need a caror
[1:06:07] drink but look what he
[1:06:10] said Jesus said unto her whosoever
[1:06:13] drinketh of this water shall thirst
[1:06:18] again but whosoever drinketh of the
[1:06:20] water that I shall give him shall never
[1:06:23] thirst
[1:06:24] but the water that I shall give shall be
[1:06:26] in him a well of water springing up into
[1:06:29] everlasting life amen the woman sth unto
[1:06:32] him sir give me this water that I thirst

[1:06:51] disciples go in the city and go bu meat
[1:06:55] cuzz he knew they wasn't converted yet
[1:06:58] and they would say something with him
[1:06:59] talking to a illan woman that all she

[1:08:53] the ministry a bishop or whatever you
[1:08:55] want to call him he might be a great man
[1:08:57] LED of God and anointed of God but it's
[1:08:59] your
[1:09:00] faith we know some people that had gifts
[1:09:03] the prophet just had a special gift that
[1:09:05] was going to be expressed in some people
[1:09:07] like the Mexican lady baby died and the
[1:09:10] baby was brought back that was special
[1:09:11] gift but your faith this

[1:11:57] that the Lord pitching not man his
[1:11:59] Tabernacle wasn't pitched by man it was
[1:12:01] pitched by God and the Bible says in
[1:12:04] Hebrews glory to God H the tri came out
[1:12:08] and the Tabernacle was it called of
[1:12:10] Judah in which the tribe or priesthood
[1:12:13] was not called why did he say Judah cuz

[1:13:00] worship shall worship the father in
[1:13:02] spirit and in truth for the father seek
[1:13:05] such to worship him God is a spirit and
[1:13:07] they that worship Him must worship Him
[1:13:10] in spirit and in truth now watch what
[1:13:11] the lady did play close attention what
[1:13:15] the lady did see I told my mama it only
[1:13:17] one word that I'm preaching to you
[1:13:19] having Bible study you you grab a hold
[1:13:21] to one word
[1:13:24] and you
[1:13:25] ignited see e took one word and throwed
[1:13:29] all of us into sin job 14:1 said
[1:13:32] everyone that's born of woman is full
[1:13:34] few days and full of trouble come forth
[1:13:37] from his mother speaking lies she took
[1:13:41] one word and thr us into sin now this
[1:13:43] woman took one word and brought her into
[1:13:45] her body change into her nature her
[1:13:48] nature was changed cuz everybody in the
[1:13:50] community know she was a prostitute so
[1:13:52] she had a prostitute nature but now
[1:13:54] let's look at what happened to her the
[1:13:57] Bible said she got converted the whole
[1:13:59] city off of her testimony the prophet
[1:14:02] said it too in having faith in God and
[1:14:05] he said in Jezebel spirit and different
[1:14:07] messages he showed the woman nature was
[1:14:09] changed by one word she entered into the
[1:14:13] holies of holies by the spirit cuz Jesus
[1:14:17] said I had to go by Samaria because it
[1:14:20] was somebody there that predestinated
[1:14:24] that woman was predestinated no matter
[1:14:26] what she did she was predestinated now
[1:14:29] she said you a prophet K and all of them
[1:14:32] said he was beur he was a prince of
[1:14:34] devils he was gluttonous all this stuff
[1:14:36] that said about Jesus and and John the
[1:14:38] Baptist but now watch what this lady say
[1:14:41] showing that you can take one word and
[1:14:44] walk out of your condition you can take
[1:14:46] one word and denounce every Spirit
[1:14:49] that's against your life you can take
[1:14:51] one word and cast cast out the jealous
[1:14:54] demon one word and cast out the
[1:14:56] backbiting demon one word and cast out
[1:15:00] amen vile conversation on the phone with
[1:15:02] other
[1:15:04] people one word and walk out your
[1:15:07] condition except you love that
[1:15:11] Spirit the Holy Ghost don't love that
[1:15:14] spirit it's to heal it's to crush and
[1:15:17] take away and bring you into the
[1:15:20] presence of the mighty king amen that's
[1:15:22] what he come to do that now Paul said I
[1:15:25] walk from glory to glory even by the
[1:15:29] spirit of God and Paul was a great
[1:15:32] Apostle so I told the guys there was
[1:15:35] only one man in the Bible that was
[1:15:37] ordained Apostle we can ordain anybody
[1:15:40] we want as an
[1:15:42] apostle but truly are they Apostle they
[1:15:46] not and the only apostle that I know is
[1:15:50] is Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ and
[1:15:53] when he got to the end of his ministry
[1:15:55] he said I'm a
[1:15:57] prisoner of the
[1:15:59] Lord he said I count it all Philippians
[1:16:02] 4 I count everything as D so his ability
[1:16:08] 20 years in the Roman prison he said I'm
[1:16:10] a prisoner of the Lord he was even
[1:16:13] saving people in prison I bet if some of
[1:16:15] us get throw in jail right now we'll
[1:16:18] lose our
[1:16:19] Christianity Oh Glory to God Paul said
[1:16:22] I'm sinning oh GL to pH Phil himon I'm
[1:16:25] sending him to you who he was y'all know
[1:16:28] who he was glory to God he said I'm
[1:16:30] sending to you this man that was your
[1:16:33] slave and he robbed you he took
[1:16:35] everything you got glory to God I'm
[1:16:38] sending him to
[1:16:40] you that he not only be a brother not
[1:16:43] only a servant but above a
[1:16:46] brother that's what Paul
[1:16:48] said Paul witnessed to him and
[1:16:51] ministered to him and converted him him
[1:16:53] in prison and when he got out of
[1:16:56] prison Paul told filimon to accept him
[1:17:00] as a brother in The
[1:17:04] Gospel this woman said unto him the
[1:17:06] Messiah is coming which is called the
[1:17:08] Christ when he is come he will tell us
[1:17:10] all things Jesus said unto her I am I
[1:17:14] that speak unto thee am he see he told
[1:17:17] him now look what he say and upon this
[1:17:21] came his disciples and marveled
[1:17:23] as he talked with the woman and yet no
[1:17:25] man said what seekest thou or what why
[1:17:28] talkest thou with her the woman then
[1:17:31] left her water pot and went her way into
[1:17:33] the City and said to the men said to men
[1:17:38] now glory to Jesus come see a man which
[1:17:42] told me all things that I ever did is
[1:17:44] not this the
[1:17:46] Christ come and see a man which told me
[1:17:50] all things that ever I did is not this
[1:17:54] to Christ then they went out of the city
[1:17:57] and came unto him so she converted the
[1:18:01] whole
[1:18:02] city off of her
[1:18:05] testimony in the meanwhile his disciples
[1:18:08] prayed him saying Master eat but he said
[1:18:10] unto them I have meat to eat that you
[1:18:13] know not of Romans 3 and come to a close
[1:18:17] being I'm too long up here Romans 3 and
[1:18:21] 25
[1:18:25] 3 and
[1:18:30] 25 Romans
[1:18:32] 3 and
[1:18:34] 25 whom God have set
[1:18:38] forth for to be a
[1:18:41] perpetuation through faith in his what
[1:18:45] blood to declare his righteousness from
[1:18:47] the for the remission of sins that is
[1:18:50] passed through the forbearance of God
[1:18:53] yes so now what Jesus done for you and I
[1:18:57] that word
[1:18:58] propitiation is to
[1:19:01] conciliate an atoning
[1:19:04] sacrifice so whom God has set forth to
[1:19:07] be a atoning
[1:19:09] sacrifice through
[1:19:12] faith through faith his blood was to
[1:19:17] conciliate your
[1:19:20] unrighteousness through the forbearance
[1:19:23] of God and that word forbearance mean to
[1:19:26] hold
[1:19:27] up hold up this person that's a sinner
[1:19:31] until God Saves them hold them up bear
[1:19:35] with them glory to God if they a sinner
[1:19:38] bear with them cuz you were saved by the
[1:19:40] same Grace that they need to come by so
[1:19:43] hold them up don't talk about them don't
[1:19:46] say bad things about him that's Glory
[1:19:49] see when you see who God has set forth
[1:19:52] to be a per situation he was the atoning
[1:19:55] sacrifice for you and I and until you
[1:19:57] get the Holy Ghost it's still an atoning
[1:20:00] sacrifice for you and I
[1:20:02] am and atoning Sack sometime we take the
[1:20:06] vice versa path when we figure we a
[1:20:08] Christian and we message Believers and
[1:20:10] we think we got the Holy Ghost then we
[1:20:11] get mean and arrogant and all kind of
[1:20:14] other spirits on us amen but I tell you
[1:20:18] it don't make no different if you're a
[1:20:20] mess believer or you're a sinner
[1:20:23] if you need to be conncted I'm going to
[1:20:26] give it to
[1:20:27] you and my wife has been helping me to
[1:20:31] give it to you with so much sugar and
[1:20:35] Grace that I have no other choice but to
[1:20:37] do it that way honey you shouldn't have
[1:20:39] talked to him like that I said well
[1:20:42] thank you Jesus you got to give them
[1:20:44] with so much love and grace or you can
[1:20:46] cut them up with the gospel and with the
[1:20:48] knowledge but that's won't save them you
[1:20:51] must bring them because you have have
[1:20:52] been saved by that same
[1:20:56] Grace the perpetuation through
[1:21:00] faith and the
[1:21:02] forbearance of God Amen bear with them
[1:21:06] hold them up
[1:21:09] Ure with your brothers and sisters
[1:21:11] that's still a sinner that still might
[1:21:13] not look like a Christian glory to God
[1:21:15] see we work on so much of looking like a
[1:21:16] Christian instead of acting like one and
[1:21:19] living like one see we put on a dress or
[1:21:23] nice suit and tie but we so far away
[1:21:25] from Christians Jesus called them white
[1:21:27] ex
[1:21:28] suppers full of dead men bones but act
[1:21:32] like a Christian look like a Christian
[1:21:34] glory to God Lord have mercy I got so
[1:21:38] upset with the guys at
[1:21:40] work I came in at
[1:21:42] 7:00 said y'all acting like the devil
[1:21:44] today you must be born
[1:21:47] again went ready in office as you must
[1:21:49] be born
[1:21:50] again now and stop all this foolishness
[1:21:54] CU Jesus is right here ready and if they
[1:21:56] say Lord I need you God would have feel
[1:21:59] them right there but sometime the heart
[1:22:01] get
[1:22:02] hard and then you have to beat them to
[1:22:06] submission amen but see God's Grace has
[1:22:11] to be with us and that what brings
[1:22:13] complete love and forbearance to endure
[1:22:17] with the
[1:22:18] sinner even our children we have to have
[1:22:22] complete love for our
[1:22:25] children amen I said Lord if I have
[1:22:28] learned this 10 years ago CJ he you have
[1:22:32] to love
[1:22:34] him it's hard to go beyond that but
[1:22:37] Jesus loved that sinner
[1:22:39] lady to the point that he had to send
[1:22:42] his disciples
[1:22:44] away cuz they were Halfway
[1:22:46] Christian they ain't had the Holy Ghost
[1:22:48] yet so God is teaching us to love your
[1:22:52] your children love your brothers and
[1:22:55] sisters and when you think you above
[1:22:58] them then you have great love for them
[1:23:00] amen cuz that's what draws them into the
[1:23:04] presence of the shakana glory amen and
[1:23:07] that is the power of the
[1:23:11] Resurrection through the forbearance of
[1:23:14] God to
[1:23:16] declare I say at this time his
[1:23:20] righteousness so when you doing you're
[1:23:22] declaring his
[1:23:24] righteousness that he might be just and
[1:23:27] the justifier of him which believeth in
[1:23:31] Jesus see you believe Jesus to get saved
[1:23:34] you believe Jesus for your healing
[1:23:36] believe Jesus to save your brother and
[1:23:37] your sister in the church right beside
[1:23:38] you believe Jesus to save your children
[1:23:41] you have to believe but you think once
[1:23:43] you get saved and everything's over
[1:23:44] that's when the trouble
[1:23:46] start where is boasting then it is
[1:23:48] excluded by what law of Works n but of
[1:23:51] law of faith Psalms I'm Psalms
[1:23:55] 37 I could have quoted but I said let's
[1:23:58] read it Psalms 37 and four Delight
[1:24:02] thyself in the Lord and He Shall give
[1:24:05] Thee the desires of thine heart commit
[1:24:07] thy ways unto the Lord
[1:24:10] commit that word commit means to
[1:24:13] surrender it means to
[1:24:16] relinquish all authority and power to
[1:24:20] Jesus relin wish surrender
[1:24:25] commit thy ways unto the Lord trust also
[1:24:29] in him and he shall bring it to pass and
[1:24:33] he shall bring forth his righteousness
[1:24:37] as the light and thy judgment as the
[1:24:40] noon
[1:24:41] day
[1:24:43] amen faith is based on
[1:24:47] conviction faith is based on
[1:24:50] conviction and when the the conviction
[1:24:52] of God strikes your
[1:24:55] heart he gave one man one Talent gave
[1:24:59] another one two and he gave another one
[1:25:02] five it's according to what God saved
[1:25:04] you
[1:25:05] from if he save you from a condition of
[1:25:09] sin you was a rank
[1:25:11] sinner that woman at the well and that
[1:25:15] woman that was caught in
[1:25:17] adultery I was just witnessing the other
[1:25:20] day some people at the church at the
[1:25:23] hospital I said now
[1:25:27] Jesus they caught that woman in
[1:25:30] adultery and the reason that those men
[1:25:32] were mad I believe is
[1:25:36] because they weren with him I said Jesus
[1:25:40] wrote down the ground he probably was
[1:25:42] writing the name of the initial and he
[1:25:44] stood up and she said where your
[1:25:47] accusers she said I have
[1:25:49] none she said he said neither do I
[1:25:51] condemn you so if you got a sister or
[1:25:54] brother in the church that you want to
[1:25:56] hold something over their head in
[1:25:59] condemnation look at your
[1:26:02] sins and once you see your sins as
[1:26:05] Scarlet he'll make you white as
[1:26:08] snow she Jesus said go s no more he said
[1:26:13] where your accusers she said I have none
[1:26:14] she said he said neither do I accuse you
[1:26:18] so everything was white clean from that
[1:26:20] point on so why you holding something on
[1:26:23] somebody else
[1:26:27] head God bless you
[1:26:31] musicians if Jesus bear the cross along
[1:26:34] and all the word Go free there's a cross
[1:26:37] for you there's a cross for
[1:26:41] me I went to Camden to preach the gospel

[1:28:07] said if you be the Son of God if you be
[1:28:11] a good pastor or a good Bishop get me
[1:28:14] off the cross with you but one said Lord
[1:28:17] smoke his
[1:28:19] chest remember me when you're coming to

[1:28:25] sinner so he's asking for God who is
[1:28:28] rich in Mercy Ephesians 2 and5 God who

[1:28:40] in
[1:28:41] faith and grab the promises of the
[1:28:45] Resurrection which is Jesus Christ in
[1:28:49] you God sent me something
[1:28:54] and I'm going to read it to
[1:28:58] you he said the aircraft carrier Geral
[1:29:02] Ford in the
[1:29:04] Mediterranean for
[1:29:06] Israel Dwight isenhower in the Persian
[1:29:10] Gulf Ronald Reagan in South
[1:29:13] Korea you army guys and know about the
[1:29:16] military $1 17 billion aircraft
[1:29:21] submarine
[1:29:22] that's got the
[1:29:24] power to lift off nuclear
[1:29:29] weapons they get within a 100 miles of
[1:29:33] striking so where are we this
[1:29:35] morning if jeral
[1:29:37] Ford Dwight
[1:29:40] Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan is ready
[1:29:43] for
[1:29:44] battle you may be in
[1:29:47] college you may be producing on your job
[1:29:51] big money you may be living in a
[1:29:54] beautiful house and nice
[1:29:56] cars but once the button and the orders
[1:30:00] sent out for these Super Sonic aircrafts
[1:30:07] submarines they get in
[1:30:10] position this is the only time since
[1:30:13] Pearl since the Persian Gul and the war
[1:30:18] that's in the
[1:30:19] 1940s
[1:30:20] Vietnam after Vietnam War they created
[1:30:23] the created these aircrafts they from
[1:30:26] 4.7 to17 billion do they created these
[1:30:30] aircrafts so all they do is get in the
[1:30:32] water and get close to Striking Distance
[1:30:35] if they had these aircrafts submarines
[1:30:38] doing Vietnam they could come up on the
[1:30:41] water and decimate Vietnam without even
[1:30:44] one foot soldier so where we at now if
[1:30:48] they're within a 100 miles of all these
