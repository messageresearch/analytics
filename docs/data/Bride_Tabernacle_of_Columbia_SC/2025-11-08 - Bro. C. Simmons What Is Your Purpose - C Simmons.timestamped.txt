[41:04] Let us bow our heads.
[41:07] Lord Jesus, we thank you that we can
[41:09] depend on you, Lord Jesus, through the
[41:11] storm, through the rain, through
[41:12] sickness, and even pain. Lord, we thank
[41:15] you that we can open our mouths and say,
[41:16] "Thank you, Lord, for being so good and
[41:19] such a good God." Lord, we ask that you
[41:21] just come and move us out of the way,
[41:23] Lord. Get all the glory, get all the
[41:25] praise, and Lord, get all the honor. In
[41:27] Jesus name we pray.
[41:29] Amen. [music]
[41:31] Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[41:33] we're going to turn to the book of,
[41:37] Acts chapter 26.
[41:43] Anybody glad to be in the house of the
[41:45] Lord tonight?
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] Acts chapter 26. When you got it, say
[42:10] amen. We're going to start reading at
[42:12] verse 12.
[42:18] And it reads, "Whereupon I was in
[42:21] Damascus with authority and commission
[42:23] from the chief priest. At midday, O
[42:26] king, I saw in the way a light from
[42:28] heaven above the brightness of the sun,
[42:32] shining round about me, and them which
[42:34] journeyed with me. And when we were all
[42:37] fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
[42:40] speaking unto me, and saying in a Hebrew
[42:43] tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
[42:46] me? It is hard for thee to kick against
[42:48] the pricks. And he said, Who art thou,
[42:51] Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom thou
[42:55] persecutest?
[42:57] But rise and stand upon thy feet, for I
[43:00] have appeared unto thee for this
[43:02] purpose, to make thee a minister, and a
[43:05] witness both of these things which thou
[43:10] hast seen, and of those things in which
[43:12] I will appear unto thee, delivering thee
[43:15] from the people, and from the Gentiles,
[43:17] unto whom now I send thee, to open their
[43:20] eyes, and to turn them from darkness to
[43:22] light, and from the power of Satan unto
[43:25] God, that they may receive forgiveness
[43:28] of sins and inheritance among them which
[43:31] are s sanctified by faith that is in me.
[43:36] Whereupon, oh king of grippa, I was not
[43:38] disobedient unto the heavenly vision.
[43:41] But show first unto them of Damascus and
[43:43] at Jerusalem and throughout all the
[43:45] coast of Judea and then to the Gentiles
[43:48] that they should repent and turn to God
[43:50] and do works meet for repentance. For
[43:53] these causes the Jews caught me in the
[43:55] temple and went about to kill me. Having
[43:58] therefore obtained help of God, I
[44:01] continue until this day witnessing both
[44:04] to small and great, saying none other
[44:06] things than those which the prophet and
[44:09] Moses did did say should come that
[44:13] Christ should suffer and that he should
[44:16] be the first and that thou should rise
[44:18] from the dead and should show light unto
[44:22] the people and to the Gentiles. God
[44:24] bless. You may be seated.
[44:30] Tonight I'd like to speak on a little
[44:31] topic that I entitled, "What is your
[44:34] purpose?"
[44:36] What is your purpose? And if you read in
[44:39] verse 16 here, Paul said,
[44:44] he said, "For for for I had appeared
[44:47] unto thee for this purpose." See, Paul,
[44:50] he got to Paul had a visitation from
[44:52] God. Before that, Paul thought that his
[44:55] purpose was to chastise the Christians.
[44:58] He thought that his purpose was to go
[45:00] and persecute the church. He thought
[45:02] that he had a righteous purchase
[45:04] purpose. He thought that what he was
[45:06] doing was right. And many of times, many
[45:08] people, they get in their head their
[45:10] version of what is right. And when they
[45:13] get into their head, their version of
[45:14] what is right, it gives them a sense of
[45:16] purpose. Or they'll decide that, you
[45:18] know what, I have this thing that I want
[45:20] to achieve, so I'll go for it. That's my
[45:22] purpose. But what happens when your
[45:25] purpose is derailed? What happens when
[45:27] your purpose doesn't end up how you want
[45:29] it to be? Many people when they start on
[45:31] a journey and they said they look
[45:33] forward to this achievement and when
[45:35] they do something for example a athlete
[45:38] he might be saying you know what my goal
[45:40] is to be a professional. He starts off
[45:42] as a child he starts off and then what
[45:45] happens when he gets an injury that says
[45:46] you can no longer fulfill that purpose.
[45:49] Many people they fall that's it. Some
[45:51] people they they say is life is not
[45:53] worth living. But I ask you tonight,
[45:55] what is your purpose? What would you
[45:58] have? What would you do with your life?
[46:00] What's the purpose that you have for
[46:02] your life? And Paul, he had he finally
[46:05] understood what his purpose was. But he
[46:07] had to meet God first. He finally
[46:10] understood what he was supposed to do.
[46:12] But first, he had to meet God. He had to
[46:14] have a special visitation from God to
[46:16] show him, Paul, this is what you're
[46:18] supposed to do. And many of times many
[46:20] people they struggle in life. They
[46:22] struggle with things in life because
[46:24] they haven't found their purpose. They
[46:26] haven't found where they're supposed to
[46:27] be. They haven't found their position or
[46:30] their place in God. And so they're
[46:32] struggling. They they're wondering what
[46:34] should I do or how should I do this or
[46:36] how should I do that instead of trusting
[46:38] God and say, "Lord, you have a purpose
[46:40] for me and Lord, I put it in your hands
[46:42] and I want you to show me what you would
[46:44] have me to do."
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, that's what that that's
[46:46] that's the issue. And that's the thing
[46:48] that we got into a time in life and a
[46:50] society that everyone believes that you
[46:53] know what, I know what I'm supposed to
[46:54] do for myself. I don't have to look at
[46:57] you. I don't worry about you cuz I got
[46:58] my own path and this is the way I'm
[47:00] going to make it. But what is your
[47:03] definition of making it?
[47:06] What is your definition of achievement?
[47:09] What is your definition of success?
[47:11] Because each one of us, if I can ask
[47:13] each one of us the same question, how do
[47:16] you define success? Each one of us would
[47:18] say something different. Someone might
[47:21] say, you know what, I just want a house
[47:22] and a car. That's all I want. That's
[47:24] their definition of success.
[47:27] Someone might say, hey, I want the six
[47:28] figure job. That's their definition of
[47:30] success. Someone might say, you know
[47:32] what, I want to drive a Maserati. That's
[47:34] their definition of success. But each
[47:37] one of us have it. what is our
[47:39] definition of success? And and and then
[47:42] we use that as you know what, this is
[47:45] what I'm going to use as my purpose.
[47:47] This is what I'm going to work for. This
[47:49] is what I'm going to work hard for and
[47:51] spend my money on because that's that's
[47:53] that's that's the goal that I'm trying
[47:56] to achieve. But what if God doesn't want
[47:58] you to achieve that goal?
[48:01] Then what? No matter how hard you work,
[48:04] no matter how hard you try, you may
[48:06] never achieve it because it wasn't God's
[48:08] purpose for your life. It wasn't what he
[48:10] wanted you to do. It wasn't what he
[48:12] wanted you to achieve. And Paul when he
[48:15] had that visitation, he understood what
[48:17] his purpose was. He understood what he
[48:20] was supposed to do. Now my maybe what he
[48:22] did before now seemed contrary to what
[48:25] God had for him, but it was God's
[48:27] purpose. And as long as Paul was in
[48:30] God's purpose for his life, he was
[48:32] blessed. As long as he was in God's
[48:34] purpose for his life, everything worked
[48:36] out all right. No matter how bad the
[48:38] storm God, his pastor was talking on
[48:40] Sunday, no matter how because he had
[48:43] such a close relationship with God, he
[48:45] God could speak to him and he could tell
[48:47] others what to do. God can speak to him
[48:50] and he could tell them, "Hey, do this
[48:52] and your life will be saved." Other
[48:54] people's lives were blessed because Paul
[48:56] was in the right purpose. Other people's
[48:59] lives were saved because Paul was in the
[49:01] purpose that God had for them and said,
[49:03] "What how many of us are actually in the
[49:06] purpose that God has for us?" Have we
[49:08] sat down and searched it out, got down
[49:10] on our knees, had that had that moment
[49:13] with God that we know, Lord, this is
[49:14] what you want me to do.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; This is what you have want me to
[49:18] achieve. Lord, this is what you are
[49:20] asking me to give up so that you can do
[49:22] the work that you want me to do.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; See, that was Paul's commission to do
[49:28] these things, to go to the Gentiles to
[49:30] to preach to them that they might be
[49:32] saved.
[49:33] It it only took someone like Paul to do
[49:36] it. So, if you if you ever wonder, well,
[49:39] well, well, someone else can do it.
[49:43] Yeah. Sometimes God will tell you to do
[49:45] something and and you'll think, well,
[49:47] someone else can do it, not me. I was
[49:50] riding the other day and I stopped by
[49:52] CVS and there was this guy that's that
[49:55] was on the outside. Many times you walk
[49:56] in the stores nowadays and someone be on
[49:58] the outside asking you for something. So
[50:01] this guy, he was he was asking. I was
[50:02] like, I don't have nothing. I had a few
[50:05] dollars on me, but I I didn't feel led
[50:06] at the moment. But when I left the
[50:10] store, he asked again. He got you on the
[50:13] way in and the way out. And I was like,
[50:17] and I was walking to the car and I was
[50:19] like, I do have these $3 in my pocket.
[50:24] And I was driving down the road and
[50:25] someone said, "Turn around and give the
[50:26] man the guy the money." So I turned
[50:29] around. I I I listened to it. I said,
[50:31] "You know what? Sometimes you can miss
[50:33] your blessing cuz you ain't listening."
[50:36] And I said, "You know what? I'm going to
[50:37] turn around." I done went about a block
[50:39] down the road, two blocks down the road,
[50:41] turn it all the way around and pull up
[50:43] on the side of the road. The guy was
[50:45] outside the store. I said, "Here." Now,
[50:46] I had $3, right?
[50:50] But me saying, "You know what? I don't
[50:52] necessarily want to give all of this."
[50:56] So, you know, I want to keep something
[50:58] in my pocket. So, I reached in. I said,
[51:01] "Well, two are doing good enough. You
[51:03] know, some other people might see them
[51:05] and give."
[51:06] I gave him two. I got to riding down the
[51:09] road and something said, "You did you
[51:12] get was that all?" And I was like,
[51:13] "Lord,
[51:15] I had to turn back around."
[51:18] I said, "I don't know why I had to do
[51:20] this."
[51:22] But maybe there was something in it for
[51:24] him and there was something in it for
[51:25] me. Sometime God tell you to do
[51:28] something and it don't make no sense to
[51:29] you. And you going about your business.
[51:32] I was on the way home. It's 9 or 10:00
[51:34] at night. It's long day and I was like,
[51:37] you know what? Something is telling me
[51:38] to do this. Maybe it's for a reason.
[51:41] There's a purpose behind it. And and and
[51:44] sometimes, how many times that happened
[51:46] to people and they just brush it aside.
[51:48] Well, this was the time that I said, you
[51:49] know, you got to sometimes you just got
[51:51] to be obedient because God has a reason
[51:54] that he's trying to convey to you.
[51:56] Sometimes it's just to prove, hey, will
[51:58] you listen when I talk to you? Sometimes
[52:00] it's just to prove, will you be obedient
[52:03] and do what I tell you to do when I ask
[52:05] you to do it, no matter how small, how
[52:07] great it is. Some people only want to do
[52:09] the great things, but not the small
[52:10] things.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Well, you can't get to the great things
[52:13] if you don't aren't obedient in the
[52:15] small things. Go ahead.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Because it's just like a parent and a
[52:20] child. At some point in time, the parent
[52:22] want to be able to trust their child.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Some point in time, you want to be able
[52:26] to trust your friends. And after 3 or 4
[52:29] years, you want to be able to say,
[52:30] "Here, I give you this." And expect them
[52:32] not to spend it. If they're a real
[52:34] friend and that's what you told them not
[52:36] to do, hey, hold this for me.
[52:39] Some people they you can't ask them to
[52:41] hold something for you cuz you'll never
[52:43] see it again. But God but but when you
[52:46] get someone that's real, you can trust
[52:48] them with that level. And that's what
[52:50] God wants to build in us, that trust so
[52:53] that you can fulfill the purpose that
[52:54] God has for you in your life. so that
[52:57] you can go about and God can say do this
[52:59] and you do it because it's for his
[53:01] purpose and for his glory. It's for it's
[53:03] what he wants you to accomplish because
[53:05] it for everything. I was reading and
[53:07] there was there's a time and season for
[53:09] everything. That's what Ecclesiastes
[53:11] said. And maybe it was my time to give.
[53:14] But at some point in time, it's going to
[53:16] be my time to receive. See, I don't want
[53:18] to block my receiving because I wasn't
[53:21] ready to give when God told me to give.
[53:24] says sometimes you just got to you just
[53:26] got to listen to it because God is
[53:27] trying to teach you a lesson
[53:29] &gt;&gt; and then the lesson some later on it
[53:32] becomes your blessing
[53:33] &gt;&gt; and see you had to understand that the
[53:36] reason and the purpose of it I didn't
[53:38] see it then but later on after I lived
[53:40] by and by I understood it
[53:42] &gt;&gt; because God was showing me that if
[53:44] you're faithful in the small things
[53:47] he'll be faithful in the great things
[53:52] &gt;&gt; said purpose means it's the reason for
[53:54] which something is done or created for
[53:57] which something ex exists
[54:00] and you know I was thinking about you
[54:02] know everything in the on the planet has
[54:05] a purpose
[54:08] when God created all the animals each
[54:10] one had a purpose
[54:12] that's why they call it if you live you
[54:14] look in science there's a thing called
[54:15] the food chain
[54:18] and each each animal had a purpose in
[54:20] the food chain it you If if you were
[54:23] missing if you were missing the bees,
[54:26] there wouldn't be crops.
[54:28] If you were missing if you were missing
[54:30] the worms, then you wouldn't see the
[54:32] butterflies. All these things, no matter
[54:35] how small, if you were missing the ants,
[54:38] you do you know how different the world
[54:40] would be if ants didn't exist?
[54:42] They get rid of all a lot of trash and
[54:45] all these dead things that you don't
[54:47] even see or notice, but God had them
[54:49] there for a purpose. That's why he said
[54:52] if if if he watches over the sparrow,
[54:54] then why wouldn't he watch over you and
[54:56] me?
[54:58] &gt;&gt; See that? Because God had a purpose in
[55:00] creating a sparrow just like he had a
[55:02] purpose in creating you.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; He had a purpose in allowing you to
[55:06] live. And I got down to thinking and I
[55:08] thought about some some really dark
[55:10] moments in my life. And I went to God
[55:13] one time and I was like, "Lord, you you
[55:15] brought me through this and you brought
[55:16] me through that. Why?"
[55:19] That's a question that if you you might
[55:21] not have never got there, but some
[55:23] sometimes just being you might get there
[55:25] and you say, "Lord, why am I here? For
[55:29] what purpose was I created? What am I
[55:31] supposed to be doing? Cuz why is life
[55:34] worth living?"
[55:37] Because because life sometimes will
[55:39] weigh you down. It'll get hard
[55:41] sometimes. Life will show you size size
[55:44] that you may not have thought that you'
[55:46] be able to handle and surpass. And the
[55:48] only thing that keeps you is God.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; The only thing that keeps you through
[55:52] those moments is the grace of God and
[55:54] God being there for you.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; That you have something to stand on.
[55:58] That rock and that foundation that was
[56:00] put in you as a child comes back and
[56:02] you'll have those scriptures that come
[56:04] back to you that you can stand on.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; And see that that that's when you have
[56:12] those that faith and it becomes greater
[56:14] than what you're going through. See,
[56:16] when you have the faith in and that firm
[56:18] foundation that they spoke about
[56:20] tonight, when you on that firm
[56:22] foundation, it allows you, you may fall,
[56:24] but you won't fall to the bottom. You
[56:27] you you might stumble, but there'll be
[56:29] something that you realize, hey,
[56:30] something's holding me up. There's
[56:32] something beneath me that keeps me
[56:34] elevated, that keeps me from not going
[56:37] where other people's may have went and
[56:39] they are no longer here.
[56:41] There was a story recently in the news
[56:43] about this this a lot of people would
[56:45] call him successful and accomplished.
[56:48] This young man is a really horrible
[56:50] story. He he actually he's a NFL player,
[56:54] a young man 24 years old that decided
[56:57] that life was no more worth living.
[57:00] Now you might think that he has reached
[57:02] the prime of life. 24 years old, made it
[57:06] to the NFL, potential, not even a bad
[57:09] player, might might make multi-millions
[57:11] of dollars and just decided after one of
[57:14] his best games of his career,
[57:17] decided, you know, life is no longer
[57:19] worth living. And I thought about it and
[57:22] said, had he discovered what his purpose
[57:25] was, he might have reached his goal, but
[57:28] not even realized his purpose.
[57:32] And I and I think about that sometimes
[57:34] and said, "Are you going to miss your
[57:36] purpose because you have your goals?
[57:40] Are you going to miss your purpose
[57:41] because you have these things that you
[57:43] deem success,
[57:46] but there's something else that you're
[57:47] supposed to do? There's something else
[57:50] yearning in the inside that even though
[57:52] you're reaching goals, you said I it's
[57:55] not it's not achievement to me. It
[57:57] leaves a emptiness. It leaves something
[58:00] to be desired. It leaves you wanting
[58:02] something. And I and and I can tell you
[58:05] when you get to that place, the only one
[58:07] that can feel it is Jesus.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; When you get to that place, you got to
[58:12] have something greater than you.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; You got to have something that'll carry
[58:16] you through those moments that you can
[58:18] stand on, have faith in, believe in.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I say it when people don't
[58:26] have God, I wonder what they put their
[58:27] faith in.
[58:30] What keeps them in those moments?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; See, God put you here that you can hear
[58:35] the word, that you can be blessed, you
[58:37] can be in the right atmosphere, you can
[58:39] come to church, you can believe in God,
[58:41] you can have this and and God allowed
[58:43] you and say, "Are you taking advantage
[58:45] of the position that he placed you in?
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Are you fulfilling your purpose?" Cuz he
[58:50] placed you here for a reason. It wasn't
[58:52] just to show up, go to school, come
[58:54] home, eat food, go to sleep, wake back
[58:56] up, and do the same thing over and over
[58:57] again. You live life long enough, you'll
[59:00] question, why am I doing this?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; You got to have a reason for why you
[59:05] living. You got to have a reason and
[59:08] understand that it's greater than you.
[59:10] When God put breath in your body, it was
[59:12] to praise him. When he opened you up
[59:15] your mouth, it was to give him glory.
[59:17] When he gave you hands, it was to clap
[59:19] and give him honor. when he gave you
[59:20] feet, it was to walk and tell somebody
[59:23] about the goodness of the Lord
[59:25] [applause]
[59:26] &gt;&gt; because there was a purpose that you
[59:28] should be doing.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; And sometimes your purpose may not be
[59:33] you say, "Well, I don't I don't really
[59:35] talk a lot." But people should see the
[59:37] way that you live. It be a testimony of
[59:40] who God is.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to talk for someone
[59:44] to notice that you're different. You
[59:46] don't have to talk for someone to
[59:48] notice. You know what? I I think they
[59:51] believe when they see you at lunchtime
[59:53] and you bow your head and pray over your
[59:54] food, they say, "That's different."
[59:56] There's so many people that don't do
[59:58] that nowadays.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; But that that's different. And and many
[1:00:03] of times if you get around enough people
[1:00:05] like that, they'll respect you.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Well, we are. And I don't know about
[1:00:08] everywhere but but I I I've been in
[1:00:11] those situation where people will
[1:00:12] respect you just because that's how
[1:00:14] that's how you believe. It may not be
[1:00:16] but it's a testimony of who you are and
[1:00:19] what God has placed in you.
[1:00:23] The the prophet of God said he said now
[1:00:25] there are so many people that doesn't
[1:00:27] seem to have any kind of purpose in life
[1:00:29] especially in this day that we now live
[1:00:31] in. People just seem to think that they
[1:00:34] have that all they have to do is keep up
[1:00:36] with somebody else with the fashions of
[1:00:39] the world and with the enticements that
[1:00:41] the world has given to them. How many
[1:00:44] people think that success looks like
[1:00:47] what somebody else has?
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; How many people said well you know they
[1:00:52] point to this and said that's what
[1:00:53] success looks like.
[1:00:56] That's what and then they try to imitate
[1:00:58] everything that person does or try to
[1:01:01] find a way to pattern themsel like that
[1:01:03] because that's what success looks like.
[1:01:06] And there's many people that are now you
[1:01:08] got all these YouTube people and all
[1:01:10] these things. They'll coach you on how
[1:01:11] to be successful. And watch this 5 to 10
[1:01:14] minute video and study my program. Get
[1:01:16] in line with me and pay such and such a
[1:01:18] month and get on my subscription service
[1:01:20] and and you will be successful in 6
[1:01:23] months.
[1:01:24] But anything worth worth living for,
[1:01:28] enjoying for it takes hard work.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Anything it ain't no short scheme. Many
[1:01:33] of times the true success.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; You is working hard is laboring is going
[1:01:39] is showing up doing repetition thing but
[1:01:41] always progressing. But with God on your
[1:01:44] side, God can make success overnight.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; What you deem to be success, God can
[1:01:49] just give it to you overnight just
[1:01:50] because he wants to give it to you. just
[1:01:52] because he realized you know what they
[1:01:54] were faithful in the small things. Here
[1:01:56] you go.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Here you go. Because they they were
[1:02:00] doing what I asked them to do. They were
[1:02:02] fulfilling their purpose. And when you
[1:02:04] fulfill your purpose, here's what comes
[1:02:05] with it.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Said there's so many, especially in the
[1:02:09] day that we now live in, they just seem
[1:02:11] to have no purpose.
[1:02:14] It seems
[1:02:16] to just be the limit of the American
[1:02:18] ambition is to get a new job. is to get
[1:02:22] a raise in your salary, to get a
[1:02:24] television or a new car. Sometimes we
[1:02:27] are prisoners of the moment of what our
[1:02:29] purpose could be. And many of times I've
[1:02:32] even felt prayed to this where you set a
[1:02:34] goal and it's up here. But somehow God
[1:02:37] blesses you and you meet that goal and
[1:02:39] then you spend six months to a year not
[1:02:41] doing anything because you never set
[1:02:43] goals past it
[1:02:46] because you you achieve this great thing
[1:02:49] that people say were a great thing and
[1:02:50] when you got there you weren't
[1:02:52] satisfied.
[1:02:54] Many people are like that in life. They
[1:02:56] become these great things and then when
[1:02:58] they get there it's like that's all.
[1:03:01] Like the young rich ruler, he had
[1:03:03] everything. Everybody would have said
[1:03:05] that's success right there. He's got
[1:03:07] money. He's got popularity. He's got
[1:03:09] fame. He lived a righteous life. That's
[1:03:11] success right there. But it was
[1:03:13] something else he wanted. He wasn't
[1:03:15] fulfilled even though he had achieved
[1:03:17] what everyone else deemed to be
[1:03:19] successful. There's many of people that
[1:03:21] have a lot of money, they're not happy.
[1:03:23] There's many people that have a lot of
[1:03:25] fame, they're not happy. There's many
[1:03:27] people that have a lot of things, but
[1:03:28] they're not happy. Because things
[1:03:31] doesn't bring happiness. Money doesn't
[1:03:33] bring happiness. The only thing said the
[1:03:36] Bible said the joy of the Lord is my
[1:03:38] strength.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; See that joy that he gives you, no man
[1:03:41] can take it from you. The devil can't
[1:03:43] take it. Only thing you can do is give
[1:03:45] it away, but no man can take it from
[1:03:47] you.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Said this joy that I have, the world the
[1:03:52] world doesn't give and the world can't
[1:03:53] take it away. Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; He said, let me say these. Those things
[1:03:58] may be all right, but there's higher
[1:04:00] ambition in human life than those
[1:04:02] things.
[1:04:04] And Christians should set their
[1:04:06] affections on higher ambitions. I think
[1:04:09] it would pay us all to sit down and
[1:04:11] wonder why we're here in the first
[1:04:14] place. And ever who was kind enough to
[1:04:16] bring us here, we ought to consider and
[1:04:19] ask him what he what would have us what
[1:04:23] what would he have us to do? the purpose
[1:04:25] of us coming to fulfill what he has
[1:04:28] purposed for us that we seem to just be
[1:04:30] wanting to just to keep up with the
[1:04:32] world.
[1:04:36] He said now that's just about the
[1:04:37] attitude of people. The prophet of God
[1:04:40] told a story about this man. He came to
[1:04:41] his house and back then it was common
[1:04:43] for people to be what they call
[1:04:47] maybe I term it drifters. So they would
[1:04:50] travel around the country and they
[1:04:53] wouldn't have a home. They wouldn't have
[1:04:54] a place to stay. They just, you know,
[1:04:56] wherever their head laid at night,
[1:04:58] that's where they would lay. And the
[1:04:59] next day, they just move on and do these
[1:05:01] things. Some some people might call them
[1:05:04] hobos, if that's a better term. But this
[1:05:07] man came to his house and said, "Can you
[1:05:08] get something to eat?" And and and
[1:05:11] prophet God, he invited him in. He said,
[1:05:12] "I'm not just going to give you a
[1:05:13] sandwich. I'm going actually give him a
[1:05:15] meal." And he asked the man, he said,
[1:05:17] "Where you from?" And the man said, "I'm
[1:05:20] from nowhere." He said, "Where you
[1:05:22] going?" He said, I don't know. And he
[1:05:26] said, and the prophet of God said, and
[1:05:28] and what's your purpose? He said, I I
[1:05:30] don't know. And prophet God said, many
[1:05:33] people we get in, they get into their He
[1:05:35] said, now that's just the attitude of
[1:05:37] people. Just what I call drifters,
[1:05:39] floaters, and he said they have no
[1:05:42] ambition.
[1:05:43] They just want to go through and just
[1:05:46] let life happen and live where they live
[1:05:48] and list where they list. and you know
[1:05:50] one day I'm going to die and that's the
[1:05:53] end of it. And there's people that are
[1:05:56] like that. But he said now that's just
[1:05:57] like the attitude of people just what I
[1:05:59] call drifters floaters. And people who
[1:06:01] join the church is just about the same
[1:06:04] is often thought of floating driftwood.
[1:06:07] And driftwood it just hangs up in any
[1:06:10] kind of trash. That's just the way that
[1:06:12] floaters does in the church or anywhere.
[1:06:16] Now you take on a stream like the stream
[1:06:18] of life. the and plenty of driftwood
[1:06:21] hanging up in every trash pile. And yet
[1:06:23] the boat comes along made out of wood,
[1:06:26] too. But if you notice, the wood is made
[1:06:28] and shaped out by a master who has built
[1:06:31] the boat. Not only is it shaped out, but
[1:06:34] is guided by a master and is pushed by
[1:06:37] power. And we're all made out of the
[1:06:40] same stuff. It just depend on how your
[1:06:42] ambitions run. Are you willing to let
[1:06:45] the master craftsman make out of you
[1:06:48] that which he would he could use and
[1:06:50] that which he could control and that
[1:06:52] which he could power? He says we're all
[1:06:55] made out of the same stuff. Some people
[1:06:57] wonder why one didn't make it and the
[1:06:59] other one did. Sometimes he said it was
[1:07:01] about ambition.
[1:07:03] But sometimes one didn't make it and the
[1:07:06] other one did. Cuz one allowed the
[1:07:07] master craftsman to come and shape them,
[1:07:10] mold them, and allowed them to one day
[1:07:12] when he got done shaping and molding
[1:07:14] them, they was able to travel faster
[1:07:16] than all the wood that was standing on
[1:07:17] the side. All the ones that thought they
[1:07:19] had achieved greatness. When God got
[1:07:21] done with them shaping and mass and
[1:07:24] molding them, they reached higher levels
[1:07:26] and higher greater heights than the
[1:07:28] people that was working so hard to get
[1:07:30] there and achieve it. Because God was
[1:07:33] doing the work, not them doing the work.
[1:07:35] It was him molding and making them and
[1:07:37] taking them through test and trials that
[1:07:39] when they came out they was hardened
[1:07:41] that the water couldn't seep through.
[1:07:43] The things of life couldn't overtake
[1:07:45] them, couldn't overcome them because now
[1:07:48] they were built up. They were shaped and
[1:07:50] they was able to cut through the waves.
[1:07:51] They was able to cut through the storms
[1:07:53] and the waves of life because they were
[1:07:55] shaped and they was made and molded in
[1:07:57] such a way that they can make it
[1:07:59] through. And there was something that
[1:08:01] was guiding them. It was the master that
[1:08:03] was in the ship. And the master was in
[1:08:05] the ship. Not only that, he was putting
[1:08:07] power behind the ship to guide it right
[1:08:09] on along the way and said, "That's what
[1:08:11] it takes. Sometimes you got to let go of
[1:08:13] your ideas, your your achievements, and
[1:08:16] your things so that God can guide you.
[1:08:19] That he can lead you. And he can take
[1:08:21] your ship and allow you to cut through
[1:08:22] the waves of life, the storms of life,
[1:08:24] and he can allow you to when he when he
[1:08:26] leads you left, you go left. And when he
[1:08:28] leads you right, you go right. Because
[1:08:30] there might be a storm on the left and
[1:08:32] there might be waves on the right, but
[1:08:34] he'll keep you right down the straight
[1:08:35] and narrow. And he'll allow you to keep
[1:08:37] going through and to keep going through.
[1:08:39] And it might get skinny sometimes. The
[1:08:41] wave and the storm might come this
[1:08:43] close, but God made the boat just so
[1:08:45] that he can pass right on through it.
[1:08:47] And see, when you get the understanding
[1:08:49] that that's my purpose, this is what I'm
[1:08:51] supposed to do. It becomes an easier
[1:08:53] journey. It becomes easier to let God
[1:08:55] have his way. It becomes easier to say,
[1:08:57] "Lord, have your way." It becomes easier
[1:08:59] to say, "Lord, I surrender and I give up
[1:09:01] everything." It becomes easier to say,
[1:09:03] "Lord, do the work that you want to do
[1:09:06] in me because Lord, I'm your child and
[1:09:08] use me for your glory." Said, once you
[1:09:11] understand that it's the master that
[1:09:13] wants to do it, it's not just somebody
[1:09:15] or something. It's something greater
[1:09:17] than you. You understand what your
[1:09:18] purpose is.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; But it's not until you get down and say,
[1:09:22] "Lord, show me what you want me to do."
[1:09:25] And he might not show you the end of the
[1:09:27] staircase, but sometimes you need to
[1:09:29] know the next steps. Sometimes you're
[1:09:31] like, "Lord, what would you have me to
[1:09:32] do? What was the purpose? Lord, why
[1:09:34] would did you put me in this situation?
[1:09:36] Why did you put me in this conversation?
[1:09:39] Why, Lord, did you let this person cross
[1:09:41] my path? Lord, let me allow me to say
[1:09:43] something that would lead them to you.
[1:09:45] Lord, sometimes I don't have to be the
[1:09:47] harvester, but may I plant the seed.
[1:09:49] Lord, may I water the seed. May I do
[1:09:51] what you have me to do that one day if
[1:09:53] we make it over there I see them and
[1:09:55] they come up to me and say you know what
[1:09:57] it was that thing that you said that
[1:09:59] changed my life.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; It's not that I want glory or anything.
[1:10:02] Lord I want you to have your will and
[1:10:04] your way in my life. Lord I want you to
[1:10:07] do something in me that when I wake up
[1:10:08] in the morning it's worth living. It's
[1:10:11] worth getting up. It's worth breathing.
[1:10:13] It's worth giving you glory and honor
[1:10:15] and praise. Lord I want to do that
[1:10:16] anyway. But I want to see the fruits of
[1:10:18] the labor. Lord, I want to see that that
[1:10:21] you're doing the work in my life that
[1:10:23] it's a testimony that I can come and
[1:10:25] encourage someone else to say, you know
[1:10:26] what? I gave my life to Christ. That
[1:10:28] ain't that wasn't the end of my story. I
[1:10:31] I walk with the Lord and and and that
[1:10:33] wasn't the end of my story. Someone else
[1:10:36] saw the testimony of my life and they
[1:10:38] came to the Lord and he said, "One soul
[1:10:40] is worth 10 billion worlds."
[1:10:43] 10,000 worlds. Yeah.
[1:10:46] 10,000 worlds. But but what it what it
[1:10:50] means is that it's immeasurable.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; You can't count. If you were out there,
[1:10:56] you might get lost and have to recount.
[1:10:58] But you see, God has something that's
[1:11:01] greater and that he wants each and every
[1:11:03] one of us to do. And what he has for you
[1:11:06] to do is not what he has me to do. Cuz
[1:11:08] he didn't create me for your storms and
[1:11:10] your test and trials. He didn't create
[1:11:12] you for my storms and test and trials.
[1:11:14] But when he created us, he created us
[1:11:16] perfect. And well, he created us so that
[1:11:19] we can come to him and he can make us
[1:11:21] perfect. That we can make it to one day
[1:11:24] that we can cross over and that we can
[1:11:26] come to him and say, "Lord, some way,
[1:11:28] somehow, by the grace and mercy of God,
[1:11:30] I made it over."
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; That that's the only reason that I made
[1:11:36] it over was your grace and mercy. But
[1:11:39] some way somehow I thank you that you
[1:11:41] blessed me that I was able to make it
[1:11:43] over and and and that I lived a life for
[1:11:47] you.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Said I can't I can't do much but that's
[1:11:51] one thing that I can do is live the life
[1:11:53] that I have and live it for you.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; And and so that Lord I want to make sure
[1:12:00] that I'm doing what you have for me to
[1:12:02] do. Each day that I wake up I want to
[1:12:04] make sure that I'm doing what you have
[1:12:06] for me to do. that that my purpose is
[1:12:08] fulfilled. There's many stories in the
[1:12:11] Bible, but I I thought about Joseph and
[1:12:13] I said everything that Joseph went
[1:12:15] through in life was for a greater
[1:12:17] purpose than himself.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Many of times you thinking, why am I
[1:12:22] going through this? Why why do I
[1:12:25] struggle with this? Why do I face this?
[1:12:28] Maybe it's something greater than you.
[1:12:30] Maybe it's for a purpose that you don't
[1:12:32] understand or you see, but it's
[1:12:35] something that's greater than you.
[1:12:36] Because Joseph had to go through those
[1:12:38] things to save his whole entire family.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Not only that, he had to he he in in in
[1:12:44] the purpose of saving his God using him
[1:12:46] to save his family, he saved all of
[1:12:48] Egypt.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; So, it was something greater than than
[1:12:52] than Joseph just going through these
[1:12:55] tests and trials.
[1:12:57] It was something greater. And no matter
[1:12:58] what Joseph went through, he didn't
[1:13:00] complain
[1:13:01] because he he recognized that these
[1:13:04] things are out of my control. These
[1:13:06] things are greater than me, but it's for
[1:13:08] something that God wants me to do.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You appreciate the word tonight.
[1:13:24] Amen.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord hands up for praise. Amen.
[1:13:28] [applause]
[1:13:29] Amen. Your purpose. Amen. As our brother
[1:13:32] Caleb was preaching tonight, you know, I
[1:13:34] was I was thinking uh was talking here
[1:13:36] at work the other day and I was saying,
[1:13:38] you know, a lot of especially when he
[1:13:41] was talking about the people um all on
[1:13:44] YouTube and all everybody's got their
[1:13:46] own fan base or whatever thing they got
[1:13:49] they pumping out, right? And uh trying
[1:13:52] to get you to look at it. I says, "But
[1:13:55] what happens with this generation today,
[1:13:57] especially with AI and all this YouTube
[1:14:01] and internet is it's causing them to to
[1:14:03] be detached from what reality really
[1:14:05] is."
[1:14:07] I says that especially with AI, it's
[1:14:09] going to come into a place to where they
[1:14:11] don't even know what reality is. So when
[1:14:14] when life as life goes on, when they get
[1:14:17] to certain situations in life, they
[1:14:19] ain't going to know how to handle them.
[1:14:21] They ain't going to know how to deal
[1:14:22] with them because it's while you
[1:14:24] watching all this mirage and all this
[1:14:27] things. Some people get rich overnight
[1:14:28] and all those things, but you got them
[1:14:30] one in a million people like we talking
[1:14:33] about with stocks and stuff. You don't
[1:14:36] once in a million, but then you have
[1:14:39] people chasing these things and chasing
[1:14:41] these things, but it detaches them from
[1:14:43] reality. Then when real situations hit,
[1:14:46] they don't know how to deal with them.
[1:14:48] And that's why you find that they they
[1:14:50] kill theel. They do all kind of stuff
[1:14:51] because now reality hit, right? Mama
[1:14:55] gone, daddy gone. Now you don't know
[1:14:57] what to do. You lived in such a dream
[1:14:59] world, right? But and I thought that
[1:15:03] that's what the danger of of what's
[1:15:05] going on today. But I'm so glad that,
[1:15:09] you know, I I look at I saw a picture.
[1:15:11] It says about success. Well, we think of
[1:15:14] success. It had a straight line going
[1:15:16] up, but it said in reality they had that
[1:15:19] line going all around in circles, all
[1:15:21] around the knots, then getting to the
[1:15:23] top. And I said that in all in some
[1:15:26] cases that's true. I says, you know, I
[1:15:29] look at my life,
[1:15:32] for example, I was speaking to a friend
[1:15:34] of mine and and he's a minister now.
[1:15:36] He's a actually a doctor of theology.
[1:15:40] And I said, you know, me and this guy
[1:15:42] came from nothing together. You should
[1:15:45] have seen us younger and that was a
[1:15:47] group of us. And to look at our lives
[1:15:50] now
[1:15:52] and to see where where each one of us is
[1:15:54] at in life, I said you never would have
[1:15:58] saw life putting you here, life bringing
[1:16:02] you there, right? But one thing about
[1:16:04] it, I am so glad that even when I wasn't
[1:16:08] seeking after God, he sought after me
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; and he called me. And I didn't I
[1:16:14] couldn't foresee the the the road that
[1:16:18] God going to take me down. It's like
[1:16:20] Paul could have I don't think Paul ever
[1:16:22] envisioned that road going down, going
[1:16:24] to the heathens, going off. If he would
[1:16:27] have saw himself, he couldn't never see
[1:16:28] himself going. But one thing about it
[1:16:31] when you when you God's got a plan for
[1:16:33] your life. I was sharing that with the
[1:16:35] younger people the other day. I was
[1:16:36] saying you know one thing about it I
[1:16:38] says when God told Gideon he said thou
[1:16:40] mighty man of valor. I said because God
[1:16:43] knows what he put in you.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; You don't even yourself know what you
[1:16:47] capable of.
[1:16:49] But we search out for all things and we
[1:16:51] thinking but God know what he put in
[1:16:54] you.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; And the whole world don't see it in you.
[1:16:59] Mom and daddy might not can't see it in
[1:17:01] you friends because everybody can't
[1:17:03] because they just looking at you for who
[1:17:04] you are. But one thing about God, he
[1:17:07] knows what he put in you
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; and and that's how he treats you because
[1:17:11] he can call you what you are because he
[1:17:13] knows what's in you. And I'm so ain't
[1:17:16] you glad that that tonight about that's
[1:17:18] how the Lord looked at you. Cuz I don't
[1:17:20] know about you. See, you had to be that
[1:17:21] one that that people looked at you and
[1:17:24] thought you say you ain't going to be
[1:17:25] nothing. you just going to be this, you
[1:17:26] going to be that and and then tear you
[1:17:28] all the way down and you even start
[1:17:30] believing that at some point because
[1:17:32] everything put your hand on you messed
[1:17:33] up. But one thing about it from the
[1:17:36] beginning of time you were in the mind
[1:17:38] of God. He knew you and one day he he he
[1:17:43] saw you like the prophet of God was
[1:17:44] saying and he recognized you. He called
[1:17:46] you by name and when you heard his voice
[1:17:50] you didn't most of most of the time
[1:17:53] people thought they were living their
[1:17:54] lives hot going on I'm part of them
[1:17:56] doing whatever but all of a sudden in
[1:17:58] the spirit realm God got started calling
[1:18:00] on you and you don't know why things get
[1:18:03] the shaking world around you get the
[1:18:05] shaking going down but you stop what it
[1:18:08] was God getting stopping you long enough
[1:18:10] so you can hear his voice and when you
[1:18:13] heard his voice you just begin to Listen
[1:18:15] Lord. And then what it did, you know,
[1:18:17] one thing about this journey, you didn't
[1:18:20] you realize I I I was thinking of it. I
[1:18:23] said it's a little word called grace.
[1:18:27] In this journey, you didn't you couldn't
[1:18:31] do get the mind frame achievement what
[1:18:34] it was grace.
[1:18:37] God saw you. He knew you and he beared
[1:18:39] with you. though your accuser trying to
[1:18:41] accuse you this and that whatever but
[1:18:43] God said that's my son that's my
[1:18:46] daughter I know what I put in them
[1:18:49] mother and father forsake them God took
[1:18:51] him up why because he know what he put
[1:18:53] in them and I'm glad that that outweighs
[1:18:56] all that I've done that outweighs all of
[1:18:59] what the people think about you that
[1:19:01] outweighs all of that aren't you glad of
[1:19:03] that tonight and not only that with all
[1:19:05] this mirage around us we still be able
[1:19:08] to look at reality
[1:19:10] What is reality? The unseen things, the
[1:19:13] things in the faith realm, that's what
[1:19:14] it is. You know, even your body, what
[1:19:16] you feel, that ain't reality. Because
[1:19:18] the Bible says with his stripes, you are
[1:19:20] healed. Right? He said, "I'm the Lord
[1:19:22] thy God that health thee." That's what
[1:19:23] reality is. What is reality? Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] That he'll supply all your needs
[1:19:28] according to his riches and glory.
[1:19:29] That's reality. Come on. I feel all
[1:19:32] right tonight. Y'all feel all right.
[1:19:35] It's the truth though, ain't it? Come
[1:19:37] on. God is so good to us. What is your
[1:19:39] purpose? Come on. We have a business and
[1:19:42] goals, but one thing about it, it's like
[1:19:44] brother Caleb was saying, and I can I
[1:19:46] can attest to that, and we was talking
[1:19:49] about that, you know, the other night
[1:19:50] too as well, how, you know, you have
[1:19:53] these people that they're searching,
[1:19:55] searching, searching. And sometimes
[1:19:57] they'll find something that occupies
[1:19:59] their time and they think they all
[1:20:00] right, but when that's over with, they
[1:20:02] go back into a hole. They go back into
[1:20:04] this depression and all. What are they
[1:20:07] searching for? It's a emptiness there
[1:20:09] and they don't know how to fill it. And
[1:20:12] I thank God that even in that when you
[1:20:15] was trying to fill it with other things,
[1:20:17] somehow someway the word came by and you
[1:20:21] just might have got a taste of it, but
[1:20:23] that taste was enough. And you felt then
[1:20:26] that, hey, this is feeling right here.
[1:20:29] Come on. And you just let go. You you
[1:20:32] you was able to block out all the noise
[1:20:33] around you. Come on. All the noise. all
[1:20:36] you was able to block out all of that
[1:20:38] and you kept tasting, you kept drinking,
[1:20:39] you next thing you know, you got full up
[1:20:42] and you realize this is what I've been
[1:20:44] searching for. Amen.
[1:20:47] [applause and music]
[1:20:54] Praise God. We thank God for the word
[1:20:56] tonight. Thank God. And I was just
[1:21:01] saying that
[1:21:03] [snorts] soft words
[1:21:05] and kind words turn away raft
[1:21:10] and
[1:21:13] we have to be more kind and loving one
[1:21:16] towards another. Amen. Cuz even your
[1:21:20] enemies,
[1:21:22] if you speak nice when they're raging
[1:21:26] and striing
[1:21:28] Tuesday night lessons,
[1:21:31] that those words can turn away
[1:21:35] wrath.
[1:21:37] But if we
[1:21:39] follow
[1:21:41] when somebody's coming against you and
[1:21:43] you go against them, then it's just a
[1:21:47] big mess.
[1:21:48] But if you begin to change the
[1:21:52] atmosphere
[1:21:53] by being nice, sweet, and kind, loving,
[1:21:58] God will bless. Amen.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; And and
[1:22:03] we had an occasion to
[1:22:06] somebody [clears throat] was really had
[1:22:08] a bad attitude cuz they were in
[1:22:10] authority. And and I was going word for
[1:22:13] word standing up for my rights.
[1:22:17] And I stood there and word for word.
[1:22:20] Then all of a sudden something just came
[1:22:22] over
[1:22:24] I says,
[1:22:26] "Sir, you
[1:22:28] what you were saying to me is such you
[1:22:31] you've been so nice. You said it in such
[1:22:34] a way that I can understand exactly what
[1:22:36] you're saying. Thank you for being so
[1:22:38] nice." But I said, "Can you help me? Is
[1:22:42] there any way you can help me resolve
[1:22:44] this particular situation?
[1:22:46] Can you help me? He said, "Oh."
[1:22:50] Everything changed. Instead of going
[1:22:54] head forhead,
[1:22:56] I asked him for help. And he turned
[1:22:59] around and he start helping me. And it
[1:23:02] was just I said, "You know, the Lord was
[1:23:06] teaching me." He says,
[1:23:09] I says, you know, you don't you don't
[1:23:11] get too old to learn.
[1:23:14] Be humble.
[1:23:16] Be careful. Be watchful.
[1:23:18] The teacher at school
[1:23:21] and maybe
[1:23:22] you're one that's an employee or you
[1:23:26] work for whatever. Maybe somebody just a
[1:23:30] friend that's coming against you. Maybe
[1:23:32] a brother or sister.
[1:23:34] Just be kind. be loving
[1:23:38] and you watch God turn things around
[1:23:42] and God stands up for you
[1:23:47] and you'll find that person that you
[1:23:48] thought was against you
[1:23:51] was the person that God was using to
[1:23:53] help you and to be a blessing to you.
[1:23:58] And I tell you,
[1:24:00] find out the person was such a wonderful
[1:24:03] nice man.
[1:24:06] I said, "See,
[1:24:09] but
[1:24:11] your approach,
[1:24:13] I wouldn't have never seen that person
[1:24:16] from that angle. If I have stood my
[1:24:19] ground and talking about my rights and
[1:24:21] you can't do me like this,
[1:24:24] but the person was in position." You see
[1:24:26] what I'm saying?
[1:24:28] And I'm going get my lawyer.
[1:24:32] Oh, we were going at it.
[1:24:37] You see what I'm saying? But if you just
[1:24:39] turn things around,
[1:24:42] how can you help me? Sir,
[1:24:46] you're telling me what I need to do, and
[1:24:49] I thank you, and I certainly appreciate
[1:24:51] what you do, but can you help me with
[1:24:53] this situation?
[1:24:55] Anybody
[1:25:01] here?
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to somebody.
[1:25:06] [laughter]
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; I I I think we can all use a little
[1:25:15] wisdom
[1:25:18] instead of [music] being combed
[1:25:21] even with marriages, husband, wife
[1:25:24] situation.
[1:25:25] Let's find a way to change the
[1:25:28] atmosphere and to be kind, nice, and
[1:25:32] understanding.
[1:25:34] And you'll see you'll pull
[1:25:38] more sweetness.
[1:25:41] Amen.
[1:25:43] If you want friends, you got to be what?
[1:25:46] Friendly. God bless you. Let us stand.
[1:25:50] Appreciate
[1:25:52] the word again. Let let us just bow our
[1:25:55] heads. Father, in the precious name of
[1:25:58] Jesus Christ. [music]
[1:26:00] You talk tonight about purpose.
[1:26:05] Lord, I believe that we all
[1:26:10] young and old,
[1:26:12] finding our position, our place in
[1:26:15] Christ.
[1:26:17] Lord, your servant said that the Holy
[1:26:19] Ghost will positionally place. It's the
[1:26:23] Joshua
[1:26:25] that position is placed in our
[1:26:27] inheritance
[1:26:29] in our position.
[1:26:32] The Holy Ghost is our Joshua. [music]
[1:26:36] So father in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:38] will we let Joshua lead us
[1:26:41] and let us not be an achen
[1:26:47] Lord God as
[1:26:50] he took that Babylonian garment.
[1:26:54] But father God let us not do things to
[1:26:56] hinder
[1:26:58] the people of God from being
[1:27:01] successful in the land that you gave us.
[1:27:05] For Father, you set us together in
[1:27:06] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:27:10] And Father God, we want you, oh God, to
[1:27:12] move here tonight.
[1:27:15] God, we want you, oh God, let your Holy
[1:27:17] Ghost move us into our inheritance and
[1:27:20] our purpose.
[1:27:22] Lord, what you chose us and what you
[1:27:24] saved us for.
[1:27:27] God, we know that you have a purpose,
[1:27:31] God. Let your will be done in our lives.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Help us now
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. How many of you
[1:27:41] want God's will, God's purpose? Lord, I
[1:27:44] want your perfect will to be done in my
[1:27:47] life. How about asking him, God, forgive
[1:27:49] me of my sins and Lord, all my ambition
[1:27:52] and all I want to achieve, Lord. I don't
[1:27:55] want to be out of the will of God. I
[1:27:56] want to be in your will. I want to be in
[1:27:59] your purpose, Lord. Lord God, whatever
[1:28:01] it takes, Lord, help me. Lord, guide me,
[1:28:04] lead me, Lord,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you Lord.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God blessed you. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:24] God can only bless Israel in her
[1:28:26] homeland.
[1:28:28] Amen.
[1:28:30] and Napalon and Zebalon
[1:28:34] is in Judah's place.
[1:28:36] It won't work.
[1:28:39] You won't be blessed until you in the
[1:28:41] place where God ordained and purpose for
[1:28:44] you to be.
[1:28:46] Amen.
[1:28:48] And how do you know you're there?
[1:28:51] When God blesses you. Because you're in
[1:28:54] that purpose. Okay. God bless you
[1:28:57] tonight. Shake somebody hand. God bless
[1:28:59] you, sister. Brother, it's good to be
