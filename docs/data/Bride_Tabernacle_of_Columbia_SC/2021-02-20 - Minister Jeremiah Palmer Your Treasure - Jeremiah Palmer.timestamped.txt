[33:10] christ's name matthew 6.
[33:22] having to depend on these glasses more
[33:24] and more
[33:27] [Music]
[33:31] 19 it says
[33:35] lay that up for yourselves treasures
[33:37] upon earth
[33:39] where moth and rust will corrupt and
[33:42] where thieves break through
[33:43] and steal but lay up for yourselves
[33:47] treasures
[33:47] in heaven where neither moth nor rusted
[33:51] with corrupt
[33:52] and where thieves do not break through
[33:54] nor steal
[33:56] for where your treasure is there will
[33:59] your heart
[34:00] be also tonight
[34:03] we want to use for a little thought for
[34:06] a few minutes tonight
[34:09] on your treasures
[34:14] your treasures and you know when you
[34:17] think about
[34:18] treasures you think about
[34:21] something that is of value
[34:26] something that is worthwhile
[34:29] holding on to
[34:30] [Music]
[34:32] a lot of times people have what they
[34:33] call sentimental values of
[34:36] things that they maybe had when they
[34:39] were a child
[34:42] and because of maybe who gave it to them
[34:44] they
[34:45] they want to just be uh hold it as a
[34:48] memorial because
[34:49] it means something to them maybe as a
[34:52] memory
[34:53] of who gave it to her
[34:57] sometimes people hold on to thank
[34:59] because of the value
[35:02] that it may be later on maybe
[35:05] it's not much now but we call it
[35:08] antiques
[35:10] that be worth something that uh
[35:14] maybe like i noticed a lot of times when
[35:16] i
[35:17] looked that used to look at a lot of
[35:19] this station that
[35:21] had a lot of i don't know what they call
[35:22] the people that they go out into the
[35:24] desert
[35:25] and entire to the remote places
[35:28] and they have been studying about and
[35:31] trying to find
[35:32] out uh where these hidden treasures are
[35:35] at
[35:37] and i remember watching one that they
[35:40] really
[35:40] uh uh had to plan carefully because
[35:44] where they had to go it was very risky
[35:48] but to them it meant something
[35:51] and they were willing to
[35:55] almost put their lives at
[35:58] danger because they were looking at
[36:02] what they were and looking to
[36:05] receive and i believe that
[36:08] anything that's worth anything there's a
[36:11] price to it
[36:14] i believe that what god even as a
[36:17] proverb said here that
[36:19] in the house of the righteous there's
[36:21] much treasures
[36:24] and i believe sometimes that we really
[36:27] don't
[36:27] recognize what we have in our possession
[36:33] because it's it's not the money oh
[36:36] it's not something that you know you can
[36:39] spend
[36:40] all but it's worth more than that
[36:44] i believe in god gave made us he gave us
[36:47] a soul
[36:49] in a circle that soul is worth me in the
[36:52] world
[36:53] they're worth about 10 000 worlds
[36:57] and the reason why because no money
[37:00] uh uh it can purchase it
[37:04] it's worth more than just uh what we
[37:08] can spend but it even can
[37:11] has heavenly value
[37:15] that's why he said hey where your heart
[37:17] is
[37:19] that will your treasure be
[37:22] when we really understand the price
[37:26] and what god did to rid
[37:29] us from the sin and the corruption to
[37:34] to give us something worthwhile
[37:38] to make life more than just fun
[37:41] and games and good times but this is an
[37:44] eternal plan
[37:46] something that no moss and and and no uh
[37:50] nothing can corrupt it but it has
[37:53] eternal value
[37:56] and we all can say within our life you
[37:59] know that
[38:00] god been good to us he been good
[38:04] at that we don't even deserve
[38:07] what he has given to us but yet
[38:10] he gave it to you in spite of
[38:14] and then how we cherish it
[38:18] what do we do with what god has
[38:21] given to us how we handle it
[38:24] you know if you really have something a
[38:26] way to value
[38:27] you really put it in a a special place
[38:32] that well nobody here really knew me
[38:34] nowhere is
[38:35] at and only you it's your
[38:38] secret and your soul
[38:41] ought to be just that precious to you
[38:44] don't let nothing uh or corrupt that
[38:49] regardless of what the world may offer
[38:52] or what value other things around you
[38:55] you got something that's worth more than
[38:58] that
[39:00] oh my and you know the more
[39:03] you you learn about god and
[39:06] and what god expects and what he has
[39:09] given to us you know i uh
[39:12] before i come in i gave rachel another
[39:15] thought you know about
[39:16] uh more than conquerors
[39:20] you know but it kind of goes in a little
[39:22] bit with it
[39:23] you know because you know god uh he was
[39:26] the mighty conqueror
[39:29] and reason why we are more than
[39:31] conquered we didn't do
[39:32] nothing even for it
[39:36] it was given to us
[39:39] and what price what what all was
[39:42] done to to to do that to to make us be
[39:46] beneficiaries of everything
[39:49] heaven god
[39:54] it's worth my dying
[39:58] it's worth all the suffering all the
[40:01] persecution
[40:03] yes you may have to cry a little while
[40:06] but don't worry
[40:06] god gonna wipe away all the tears
[40:10] the father say weeping men do for a
[40:13] night
[40:14] but joy cometh in the morning
[40:19] oh yeah i'll remember you sing that song
[40:23] i know it's worth it
[40:26] you got to ask yourself sometime is it
[40:29] really worth
[40:29] it is it worth you giving up
[40:33] everything of the world for
[40:37] does god really mean that much to you
[40:40] that
[40:40] there is nothing he can uh uh a devil
[40:43] can
[40:44] offer you that'll make you sell your
[40:46] birthright
[40:49] if you notice esau uh and jacob you know
[40:52] and uh they had esau didn't care much
[40:55] about the birthright at all
[40:57] but jacob was willing to do anything to
[41:00] get it
[41:02] it meant something to him
[41:05] esau was ready to sell it out because he
[41:08] was hungry
[41:11] for food you know and you look at the
[41:14] scenario
[41:16] you know people they are so easy to sell
[41:19] out for something on this
[41:22] earth they will leave from the presence
[41:26] of god and
[41:27] say well it's just too hard
[41:32] i'd rather take my chances and go
[41:34] through the hardship
[41:36] and stay with the things of god than to
[41:39] be a
[41:40] coward and just go away
[41:43] and just worry about oh i just couldn't
[41:45] do it
[41:46] it just seemed to be too hard
[41:49] so hard but let me tell you something is
[41:52] sin easy or is it hard
[41:55] the bible said the way of a transgressor
[41:59] is hard
[42:02] you pay for every evil thing
[42:05] you got to do and look what you benefit
[42:09] out of it
[42:10] [Music]
[42:12] nothing you got to spit it all over
[42:14] again the next day
[42:17] to try to make yourself happy
[42:20] to pretend that i'm just enjoying
[42:23] what i'm doing but at the end of the day
[42:27] you got to lay down with all that you've
[42:29] done
[42:31] and you got to ask yourself what if i
[42:34] leave here tonight where would i wake up
[42:38] at
[42:40] what have i done with the life that god
[42:44] gave me it's
[42:47] worth you giving up everything
[42:52] that this world can offer you you know
[42:54] as i hear brother earnest you know
[42:56] testimony and how you know the devil put
[42:59] challenges to you to for
[43:01] you know to give up some of the things
[43:03] of god you know and
[43:04] it's all right you know like the man say
[43:06] you know i go to church
[43:08] you know but post everybody on the job
[43:10] on a gold or whatever do
[43:13] but see there there's god i i know
[43:16] there is certain things that people
[43:19] really
[43:20] hold dear to from their heart is
[43:23] is not something they're just saying
[43:25] because they get out of doing something
[43:27] but
[43:27] it becomes a great price
[43:31] to them it's my life
[43:35] to not be able to be in the presence of
[43:39] god and
[43:40] and to give god thanks for all that he
[43:43] has done for you
[43:45] even the very life you got right now
[43:48] even
[43:48] your career everything you own is
[43:51] because of him
[43:55] it's not so much that you are a good
[43:57] person because you know the people on
[43:59] that job don't care nothing about you
[44:02] all they want is their work done
[44:06] but when they see something uh
[44:10] a person that really is not hypocritical
[44:13] about this standing
[44:15] day about to bend then they'll begin to
[44:18] say well
[44:18] i'll tell you what i've learned to say
[44:21] come
[44:22] after work then you know
[44:25] otherwise they understand that this guy
[44:27] means something to him
[44:29] what what is it about him no doubt
[44:31] ernesto looked at
[44:32] everybody probably saying you know that
[44:34] legetta fella
[44:36] you know because see they always let
[44:38] your name go out of the office and talk
[44:39] about what you thought to the boss man
[44:41] and they wondering
[44:42] what is it about him then he began to
[44:45] inquire
[44:46] does he always act like this is always
[44:49] conducted
[44:50] it says sir he always did why because
[44:54] he realized what he had is worth a great
[44:56] price
[44:59] it's a hidden trash that you can't
[45:01] explain it but
[45:03] to you it's all you got
[45:06] without that who am i
[45:10] without god in your life who are you
[45:13] you may be a multi-millionaire you may
[45:16] be successful
[45:17] you may even own our countries and banks
[45:20] but at the end of the day what is it
[45:23] going to matter
[45:25] it don't take but one illness to hit
[45:28] that body
[45:31] and then you can't even go to the bank
[45:33] to get the money you work for
[45:37] you might not even remember you even got
[45:39] the money
[45:41] because that mind can just leave just
[45:44] like that
[45:46] you know when the old people said lord
[45:47] keep my mind
[45:50] there's something about that mind that
[45:52] old people always surprised
[45:53] him my mom said lord keep my mind keep
[45:56] my mind
[45:57] because that mind is it can just go out
[46:01] you forget where you live
[46:04] or who you are i noticed my mom at 99
[46:09] she still know who she is
[46:12] you know she's getting a little you know
[46:14] getting us a little fix up now because
[46:16] we a lot of us and she said who are you
[46:18] with this
[46:19] i want my sister to say that i said well
[46:21] how mama doing this
[46:23] well she is back to normal because she's
[46:25] really getting on our nerves again
[46:28] i said well that's a good sign you know
[46:31] what
[46:32] and she's able to say that we wouldn't
[46:34] take nothing for
[46:35] it though but one thing they say mama
[46:38] always
[46:38] she said all she could say was jesus is
[46:41] going to fix it
[46:43] see she had something she she
[46:46] she got in contact with something that
[46:49] was
[46:50] real and no matter what comes the goal
[46:53] she know
[46:53] jesus will be on the scene and if he
[46:57] don't go
[46:57] hey i'll see y'all on the other side
[47:01] see she had a hidden treasure
[47:04] she don't let nothing uh just get her
[47:07] down
[47:08] like that you know she being called
[47:10] what's y'all sad for
[47:13] you know y'all better going to serve the
[47:15] lord
[47:17] you know because she realized that her
[47:19] days are getting short
[47:22] you know but god been good and we
[47:25] look out and examine our lives
[47:29] and you think things over about
[47:32] what you got and where you act
[47:35] and where you are heading what do you
[47:39] see
[47:42] go with me to one scripture book of
[47:45] hebrews
[47:51] as soon as it's raining in my mind i
[47:53] know he is worth it i know he's worth it
[47:57] he's worth my dying
[48:00] uh he's worth everything you ever go
[48:03] through
[48:04] yes paul said trouble on every side but
[48:08] yet
[48:08] not cast down
[48:14] hebrews 11.
[48:23] 2011 and 24 these heroes of faith
[48:29] you know oftentimes you know wonder
[48:32] in the old testament how the hebrew the
[48:35] faith was
[48:36] testifying of a city and things that
[48:40] they were looking for and yet they died
[48:43] didn't even see it but yet they had hope
[48:47] that it will be there
[48:51] 11 24 said by faith
[48:56] moses when he was come to years
[49:00] refuse to be called the son of pharaoh's
[49:03] daughter
[49:04] and the mother didn't want to have
[49:06] nothing to do with it
[49:09] it said in 25 choosing rather
[49:12] to suffer affliction with the people of
[49:15] god
[49:16] didn't enjoy the pleasure of sin for a
[49:19] season
[49:21] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[49:24] riches
[49:25] than the treasures in egypt for he had
[49:28] respect
[49:29] unto the recompense of reward by faith
[49:32] he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath
[49:36] of the king
[49:37] for he endured as seeing him
[49:40] who is invisible through faith
[49:44] he kept the passover and the sprinkling
[49:46] of the blood
[49:47] lest he that destroyed the firstborn
[49:51] shall touch them see moses
[49:56] saw something greater than what was in
[49:59] egypt
[50:01] though he was heir
[50:04] to it all yet
[50:08] moses said he'd rather suffer
[50:12] affliction with the people of god didn't
[50:16] enjoy
[50:17] pleasure
[50:20] how many of us are really ready to
[50:22] forsake
[50:25] what this world is trying to
[50:28] offer pleasure that's all they can offer
[50:31] something to satisfy our flesh
[50:34] to just give us some leisure confidence
[50:39] but yet we understand that there is a
[50:43] suffering that we have to endure
[50:46] but we realize it's worth every bit of
[50:49] it
[50:50] [Music]
[50:51] yes we have to be uh go
[50:54] through even in this very hour
[50:57] of what the world is encountering but
[50:59] yet we got a greater hope than this
[51:04] we'll realize that god has given us
[51:07] something
[51:09] that is able to take us through
[51:13] regardless of what comes and what goes
[51:17] the bible say greater is he
[51:21] he that is in you
[51:24] then it is in the world you're
[51:27] treacherous
[51:29] the bible says one place that eyes have
[51:32] not seen
[51:33] is they've not heard the thing that god
[51:36] has
[51:36] in store for them that love him
[51:40] your treasures god riches and treasures
[51:43] that he has given to you and i right
[51:46] here
[51:47] in the word you're rich
[51:50] you're more richer than anything
[51:54] that earth could buy
[51:57] yet you may not look like it
[52:00] but yet you are calling those things as
[52:04] though they are not
[52:06] god bless you tonight
[52:30] god rich in mercy amen we appreciate the
[52:34] word tonight
[52:35] treasures where your treasure is that

[52:59] but we have the greatest thing amen
[53:02] and that's god i was
[53:06] i was telling thank caleb i said
[53:10] this message that god has given us in
[53:12] this hour
[53:14] shows us
[53:16] [Music]
[53:18] goes way back before
[53:21] the earth was before
[53:25] [Music]
[53:26] the foundation of the world and shows
[53:30] you that you were in god
[53:32] you were part of god and that means
[53:36] everything
[53:38] and if you were part of god then then
[53:41] your son
[53:42] and daughter to god now
[53:45] amen but to manifest
[53:50] who you are you can't help it
[53:52] [Music]
[53:54] you have to manifest the word for your
[53:57] hour
[53:59] the hour you live in
[54:02] if you were a son of god a daughter god
[54:07] nobody can stop that
[54:11] amen no devil
[54:13] [Music]
[54:15] can make
[54:18] you amen
[54:22] any less than what god made you before
[54:25] the foundation of the world
[54:28] god died for you jesus died for us
[54:33] amen and in that he died for us
[54:38] you are his that's all right
[54:42] i don't know why i did that when i got
[54:44] up here
[54:46] but um by the grace of god you

[55:12] to go by once you find
[55:17] this field everything you got you give
[55:20] up
[55:21] to go preach at that field so by the
[55:24] grace of god
[55:26] everything that we got we give up
[55:30] for jesus christ everything
[55:33] nothing matters we find something worth
[55:36] giving up
[55:37] everything for amen
[55:40] and that's this tragedy this treasure
