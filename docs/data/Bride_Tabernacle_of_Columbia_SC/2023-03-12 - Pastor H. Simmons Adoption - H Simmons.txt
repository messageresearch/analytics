God that's been afflicted by the intimate God we pray that you owe God touched bodies so God heal and deliver set free by the power of the Holy Ghost In The Name of Jesus Christ bless your word today bless every heart save heal and deliver in Jesus Christ's name amen the book of Ephesians 1 one through five it says Paul and Apostle Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Christ be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed uh be God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according his he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to whom the praise and glory for to to the praise of the glory of his grace when he has made us acceptable in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace God bless you read this word you may be seated so in the fifth verse having predestinated us into adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pledge of his will so this morning we want to talk to you about con adoption and um having to do with the your place the placing of a son the placing of a son adoption somebody says he sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts here in Galatians 4. Galatians 4 and 1. adoption you know when we think about adoption and from uh the American standpoint and our day we think about a child that's going up for adoption out of a family had been adopted into another family but adoption uh according to the law of adoption it's the child that as you your own son and it's coming to maturity it's going to be on the tutor and governor and then he comes into his position now I wrote down some are you ready to be crowned or are you ready to rule adoption you come to a place that you can be trusted come to a place of maturity and that's what we're talking about you know most people just think that I'm just satisfied with just being saved or just satisfied with saying Jesus I love you Jesus uh thank you for saving me forgiving me and uh I'm I'm a Christian I'm a child of God and sometimes they use the terminology I'm born again and this and that and I'm saying there are many people of that persuasion out there and they're doing a marvelous job trying to get people to accept Jesus Christ and come out from the pardon the clubs and the all the different things that go along with worldly living they're trying to you know be churchy and go to church and love the Lord and that's as far as they go that's all that's their Outlook that's what they're looking for but adoption goes a little farther than just and I'm saying most of most uh most people are satisfied that's it you know that's it that's all I want you know somebody said if I can just make it in that's all I want to do I just want to make it in and there's others that reap the benefits of being the child of God they they are they want all the blessings that come with me in the child of God others are just satisfying not just so glad I'm saying Lord I'm so glad you know and and that set 40 50 years satisfied being the baby a baby you know the Bible says there's newborn babies is out of sincere Miracle of the word that they might grow some people they said I'm a baby as far as growing that's all right I don't want to grow I just want to stay a baby you know I'm saved and that's why you see so many uh uh people that say I'm a Christian every now and then they might curse every now and then they might backslide every now and then they might do some stuff that they not supposed to do because babies babies you know they can't walk they they crawl you know a lot of times they fall and they stumble and you know because they're babies you look for that out of babies but how would you like to have a baby that's 12 14 years old and still crawling Bob I want some milk I want some milk you know it's the babies where's my food you know you got Christians that want somebody to be responsible for the needs their needs see even coming into a teenage a lot of times parents are taking care and the the needs but it it comes a time when we move from leaning on our parents and laying on them to buy the food and you tell them what I want to eat today I don't want none of that would you go out and get me something else sometimes parents are obedient to the children okay what do you want I feel like this today I said okay well that's what I cook well I feel like I want some pork chops well okay okay what do you want I want some McDonald's [Music] what do you want I'm on Kentucky Fried Chicken so children they don't worry about where you're gonna get the money from they they don't think about whether or not you have the money they just want what they want and like a lot of Believers in church they just come and they expect it's what I want and I just want what I want babies I just want to feel good I just want a shot I want some good singing I want some good preaching and I want to go home and thank y'all but if you come to work out your soul salvation you don't want to go to work see it's another thing parents you know they said we're all living in the Mama's house and Daddy's house and and I ain't got to go nowhere but it's got to give what somehow you got to get out the nest you can't stand the nest all the time the eagle they think the little eaglets got to get out the nest are you with me so every now and then you'll never if you don't use those wings you never fly so the Little Eagles in the nests and Mama Eagle going down and killing the prey of bringing it back and feeding them then it comes a time when Mama you can say y'all too big to be in this nest it meant y'all Wings them to sprout out and amen we don't fed you enough it's time to fly so sometimes the mother Eagles takes a little ego up high in the sky and let them drop and see whether or not testing wings out if they're not able to make it mother eager scoop them back up and test them out again then what happens because they don't want to get out the nest mother Eagle begin to make the nest a little stick in a little hard on the Rocky and so forth make it uncomfortable to take you that you might Sprout up wings the Holy Spirit In Our Lives sometimes gives us a a time that we're not comfortable or too much comfort amen he makes things a little uh difficult that you need to get stronger in the law amen God wants to make you stronger amen and sometimes amen our trials are there too make us strong are you with me so I'm talking about going into adoption amen going to a place where you want your crown and you want to rule not just coming to church and amen looking oh no we're talking about being positionally placed we talk about coming into adoption though you were though you are sons and though you are children of God though your sons amen that that's good that's good to be a Son of God a daughter God but that's not enough that's not your you know God saved the people out of uh out of Egypt but the Egypt was not what where God wanted to place him I mean the Wilderness was not where God wanted to place him God was taking him on to Canaan land and God has taken you on to your position your place into what he called you into the kingdom what he attained for you to be before the foundation of the world and so God has a place in amen has a position for you that it's been prepared for you to fulfill that position in Christ amen and so God has a a a work that's been pre-ordained before the foundation of the world that only fits you amen so you must understand that it's not just coming to church amen it's not just saying I'm saved God then took away uh the taste of this so I don't smoke no more I don't drink no more I don't Club no more I don't fornicate no more I don't commit adultery no more I don't steal no more don't lie no more that's fine that's a Christian that's a Christian but that's just what Sons and Daughters supposed to be are you with me but there's a higher calling let me just read it in Galatians 4 and 1 for a minute and and try to put some Foundation to the what we're saying it says now I say that an ear as long as he is a child are you with me different nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is on the tutor and Governor until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world so he saw in another stage how when we were children we were under the bondage of the world Amen but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law there was not a law that could save us there was not a law that could justify us there was not a law that could sanctify us there was not a law Amen to forgive our sins are you with me so under the law it just identified that you we were sinners it identified our condition but none of the laws could justify us could sanctifies amen it took oh let me go that we might receive the adoption of sons the adoption of sons he said and because ye the sixth verse says but but because you are what not because you you know because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son see when the Holy Ghost come to you and fill you amen it identifies who you are it because you are Sons God sent forth the spirit of his son amen so you know that when God fills you with the Holy Ghost it's because you are Sons amen God had you in his mind before the foundation of the world and God through knew you and he predestinated you Ephesians said unto adoption are you a bit your destiny is adoption your destiny is just not to be saved and just set in the church and don't you know I mean you know just a wall fly away amen you have an office to fulfill you have a a duty amen we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works amen work out your soul salvation with fear and trembling there is a work to do and you must be about your father's business amen so a servant is trained in the father's business a son is trained in his father's business amen and when he passes the training amen that he's ready Amen to get his white robe oh you have been get the ring on his finger amen that he can do the business take over the business amen so what happens to you amen if you uh don't understand your tutorship don't understand the teacher what he's trying to train you and teach you amen you were never coming to adoption because you don't understand the way God is leading you and why you go through such trials and tribulations that God is bringing you into maturity Joseph didn't understand amen why his brothers treated him like they treated him amen but Joseph one day was going to be crowned amen so all of that you go through all of your trials all of your tests and all your tribulations amen about amen for a season it's but for a moment but it's not compared to the glory that shall be revealed in you amen praise God there is a crowning of your suffering and that is a glory to be revealed amen there's something we call adoption in the fullness of adoption takes us into the fullness of redemption the Redemption of our bodies God has a glorified body for you amen hallelujah lock unto his glorious body amen one day you'll have a glorified body one day he met oh you're suffering your pain all your Agony of this world would be over praise God but just let the oh coming into adoption it's coming into maturity now he said because you're Sons and I'm talking about not coming into a new family but because you are family amen he says not so much as a word of relationship as it is positioned we're not talking about just relationship but we're talking about your position are you with me see sometimes when we talk about adoption we're not just talking about your relationship as son because a lot of times we by relationship and by the blood of Jesus we have a relationship amen or when that's not talking about relationship because you are Sons amen you are Sons and Daughters of God by relationship amen by the blood of Jesus amen you are Sons and Daughters of God but what is your position adoption is the placing of the sun into their position on European so it's the placing of the Sun oh are you you're being positionally placed praise God and we cannot now Joshua carried the children over Jordan amen but each each one of the tribes had a place in the uh Canaan and Caleb recognized that his was the mountain and he said give me my mountains amen praise God that's my position that's my place not to lie amen and so forth they had a place by the Sea course or whatever and that was their position amen God blesses you in your position praise God God will bless you and we know that that the Bride is a whole amen God bless Israel in her Homeland and when the Jews went back in 1946 and 48 that they would begin to build recognized by the U.N and when they went back to Palestine and when they went back over there amen and reclaimed amen uh uh the Jerusalem and began to fly to the flag and it was recognized as a nation again after over 270 2000 and some years amen so amen God Amen it was signifying that Gentile time is getting ready to come to an end but it's been by the grace of God that the Gentiles time did not end then and it hasn't end as of yet God's still having a a little space a little cease now amen praise God and because of the Jews had been scattered abroad and come back to Jerusalem God is saying amen when you see amen these things happen then look up because your Redemption draws not are you up man when you see amen the Fig Tree began to Bud amen and we saw the Fig Tree we saw eildra back in a home lab amen and that signifies you better get in your Homeland and the Homeland uh the Gentiles is to come back to the word amen praise God your Homeland he said if your abide in me and my word abide in you that's your Homeland the word praise God so the word of God is where you are to be positionally but once you uh save and in Christ Jesus there is a position that God has ordered and foreign for your life that you can only be blessed in your position are you up there but if you don't understand and there's no growth and there's no maturity and there's nothing but coming to church singing this shot it gets boring after a while you'll stop coming sometime you get lazy sometimes why because that's you you know you don't see any growth they make us nothing to stir you amen you don't see your purpose amen you must understand that there's a purpose for you God didn't save you for nothing amen God had a reason in mind God Amen hadn't no even a purpose and a need praise God that he had ordained for you before the foundation of the world of amen and God said I need you amen didn't think of herself as much but how do you know that you didn't come into the kingdom for such a time is this amen God is going to use you it may be in a small way amen and maybe in a larger way but God is going to use you as he ordained for you to be used but you must understand what I find out my purpose and I find out what my position is amen then God will flourish amen I I know that I have a responsibility to maintain amen this calling that God has called me with the Holy calling amen he called me out but he didn't they meant to call me into Christ and I have been called out for purpose amen God bought me amen out and God saved me for purpose God delivered me for a purpose he redeemed me for a purpose I have a purpose Lord Lord let the Holy Ghost Joshua Place me into my position amen the Holy Ghost is going to place you in your position but you got to be humble you got to allow the holy spirit amen when he's dealing with you knowing that God knows what he's doing praise God don't be uh amen rebellious and amen just say Lord amen not my will but yours be done Jesus so please God let me let me get here the Holy Spirit now realized that they were Sons he said because your sons God is sent forth the spirit of the son into your heart crying of our father wherefore thou are no more Galatians 4-7 he said well for thou no more a servant but a son and if a son then you're what the ear of God through Christ amen now if you if you don't understand who you are as a Christian I take it from two standpoints and two perspectives I talked to you as going into adoption I'm talking to you as a a as those that need to understand amen that you are not under bondage when you accept Jesus Christ whom the son is set free as free indeed but I'm talking to those that need to go into the adoption that God is looking for maturity out of you and I'm talking to the others that you need to be born again and you need Jesus Christ and amen because God has a purpose for your life and you need to accept Jesus Christ and his will and his purpose for your life if you haven't done that then you need to realize that God Amen didn't let you just come in this world just to live a life God had a purpose amen for you being born in this world and that purpose that you deserve your the Lord the one that made you and the one that allows you to get here and the one that wants to protect you wants to keep you wants to give your joy peace and happiness are you with me so let me go on because I'm dealing with adoption this is on another level for the for the Believers and uh because I don't want you to come into a stalemate is but I wanted you to come to a place that you can't move and you can't get nowhere are you with me so I don't want you to come to a place amen that the children are Israel they just came to a place that they just went round in circles and they just couldn't go into what God had for them the prophet of God was saying the trouble with Christians today they don't realize what is provided for them they don't realize what is provided for them many people doesn't realize the great glorious power that's provided for them they don't realize that and I and that's that's what it's all about they don't realize what's in store what it means he said coming into Jesus Christ is like walking into an arcade down here are a great department store if someone gives me a great department store down here in the arcade and told me this is all yours well the first thing I'll do is I'll I I want to walk around in there and find out what I own you know people get in church and they just uh well I'm saying they don't want to know what they own it then I mean it's just you just want to clap man it becomes a traditional thing and you don't want to investigate you don't really you know you're alone search don't search up The Riches of Christ you don't want to really uh oh God all those blessings everything that's in store what do I have in the crisis when you save me God what did that mean or what what is it oh Lord see a lot of times when you're satisfied well uh well I own this and this is mine amen God has I mean far more that which we can actually think amen God got so much uh as being a Believer and being a Christian God got so much for you there's so many benefits there's so many blessings so many things that's why Paul said eyes have not seen him not heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them to love him see God everybody God wants to bring you into adoption bring you into that place that he can take you to the amen the arcade he can take you to the store and said all of it is yours amen praise God it's yours but the problem is we have a problem it's mine and and that's the way it is in Christ when you become a Christian walk around and find out what you own what's yours all things are yours given to you freely everything that Christ died for is yours everything that Christ died is yours and you say I don't want it it's my it's yours see yeah yeah you know how it is yeah yeah I heard that before but you don't believe it you don't believe it's yours oh you say healing is mine you said amen God said all my needs are supplied I I quoted it and I I say it but is it mine you know the prophet of God says we don't realize the power that we have he said it's all held down with the harness we put a harness on all the power that God has given us it's a harness on it and that heart is it called unbleek the hardest of unbelief the reason why the power amen is not being released because you don't have faith to release the power to walk into Power I said God you know I want to walk into power God I want that I want to manifest that power Lord I want to take advantage of what you gave me Hallelujah I said I may have not in time passed but God let me take advantage Glory I started feeling good because I start feeling something down again praise God I want to tell myself to Walk Around Heaven amen praise God I I want I want to I want to experience my benefits is mine oh Hallelujah Joy is mine peace is mine oh everything's belong to me praise God I'm I'm tired of letting the devil amen amen take advantage of what God has given me praise God all the folk being blessed and I'm right here and being stressed are you with me Lord folk walk around with their head up when they got all this power praise God you got to say I got joy unspeakable I got full of Glory that's what I saw in the chef over here praise God and I saw this amen praise God I saw some judgmentation amen I saw some love I

of God yes he said I'm gonna join him with Christ yes he said all things are yours and yield Christ yes all of that's been said but I don't believe it praise God the children got at the break of the promised land and they didn't believe it the land was theirs but they didn't believe it amen the promises of God all the promises of Christ that he's given us amen is yours they didn't believe it didn't why because they saw all the Giants and all the uh cities and all that was mouth oh so much amen that was facing them amen that they said we ain't able to have it we can't take it we can't have

amen the rulers at that time but he couldn't go out and amen in his office amen as a minister as a praise God until he was 30 years old John was 30 years old he didn't last for six months but he served his purpose amen praise God six months and they cut his head off are you with me Jesus ministry last three and a half years and that was it are you with me so God may call you for a short time and God may call you for longevity amen but it's it's God's purposes so don't you worry about amen how God's going to use you just said Lord I just want to please you I just want to please you I don't want to please myself I want to please God I want God to have his perfect will and way in my life I don't want to have I don't want to be sitting right here waiting on God to move and amen and God has already moved in I'm still waiting and waiting Lord when you're gonna change things amen you waiting on God to do it and God told you if you say to them amen it's going to come a time when you amen has authority to speak babies can't speak you know what you say you know sometimes they're two or three years old and sometimes oh mama daddy daddy you gotta grow up grow up amen go in the refrigerator get you some cereal or something make your peanut butter and jelly sandwich something funny that was Bubba nephew Jonathan's favorite song I don't want to peanut butter and jelly see that's what it is we don't want to become independent we want to be dependent all the time but this Rapture is an independent thing to be in the bed one be taken the other left two I mean if you want to be taken the other left are you with me so it's an independent thing can't depend on anybody but you and God your walk is between you and God it's an individual thing it's not a family thing is not a church thing it's an independent thing amen God has he's called you and you must know what is the hope of your calling that you got to be independently LED by his spirit and the way God takes you it's for you are you with me so we're afraid if I to be alone amen you're afraid to be by yourself I'm afraid he's gonna leave me it's an independent thing you got to know when it comes down to you in Christ and your salvation is not depend and hinged upon others is your faith we talk about coming in maturity it's your faith in God praise God if you don't have a prayer life it's not dependent on whether or not we have family prayer if family don't pray I gotta pray are you with me if nobody in the restaurant blesses their food I'm a blessed mind amen I'm not ashamed in the schoolhouse to let everybody know I'm a Christian praise God but when we ashamed of him he'll be ashamed of us are you with me but sometimes we'll shame to make a stand for Jesus because we still have babies we're still battling within our minds whether or not I'm truly it's just what I really want to be do I really want to be a child of God or am I a Dane or am I predestinated am I meant to be a Christian I don't fully understand it I don't fully know if if this kind of life is meant for me it's nothing but two kind of lives that you can live for God or for the devil and if if this ain't for you then what is sometimes we look at a church and we look at how people dress how people look how people talk and then it kind of life for me I want to be here I want to curse a little drink a little do this they say it ain't for me but there's a deep calling to the Deep and that's a hung in and there's a thirst for God but you don't know how to quench The Thirst and when there's a thirst for God then you got to realize who am I going to please myself or my friends or my neighbors but truly if I be honest amen I want I want to be a child of God I want to go to heaven I want to love that I I want to serve the Lord but that's got to be a desire in you somewhere down inside you that you know is real that that's my desire I don't want to be like that person that's throwing their life away and drinking and doing all kind of stuff I don't want to throw my life away there's a deep caller to the deep and there's a Desiring me to please him and that's what I want but the only way I'm gonna get it I got to take the harness off are you with me and that harness is unbelief I got to believe God I gotta trust God I got to know it's for me amen peer pressure and all kind of pressure and family pressure every kind of pressure but that's that's thank God I got to take the harness off I got to believe that God has ordained a path for me to walk and it's straight and it's narrow but that's what he'll think for me and if if I go that path God's going to be with me and he'll never leave me I'll never be alone are you with me amen I gotta try to get this and then I close the Lord's will um Matthew 17-1 God is good amen you love him do you really love you somebody said I'm scared to say it because you know I looked at some people's mouth they're scared to open it and say I love you you don't have to say it to please me amen but it's all right to say Lord I love you you know I'm not ashamed of tell him I love him I'm not saying it because the preacher tell me they said but I'd really love the Lord amen go ahead and after six days Jesus take him Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did Shone as the sun and his Rhema was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him then answer Peter and said unto Jesus what the prophet said before the Rapture take place like it was in the first resurrection when Jesus rose the Saints of old got up and they walked around Jerusalem and they saw those that were ordained to see him in the first resurrection and you read it in Matthew 27 chapter the dead Saints got up the one that was sleeping in they got up and they're walking around Jerusalem and then they had to take a journey up with Jesus and Jesus it was about 40 days brother and sister strange things can happen in our day amen Moses and Elijah was talking to him are you with me the Saints of old when Jesus died and Rose up the third day Saints got up with him walking around Jerusalem could that happen again the Saints you know I like to you know you maybe he said well you're gonna talk to Dad they ain't dead they living you know it'd be something that we communicate with the dead well we're communicating with the living this is Rapture time this is time for the changing of the body and the Saints get up and you talk with you tell you come on we're going home it's time for the body change are you up there if those these strange happenings begin to take place and all of a sudden you but the scripture happens are you with me but if see when things
