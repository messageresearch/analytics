[39:40] himself to a citizen of that country and
[39:43] he sent him into the fields to feed
[39:46] swine and he would Fain have filled his
[39:49] belly with the husk that the swine did
[39:52] eat and no man gave unto

[42:49] that don't care about that at all right
[42:52] but a good father right he'll take care
[42:55] of his children y'all believe that
[42:57] and there's no father greater than than
[42:59] God himself there's no father greater
[43:02] than him so to think about how much you
[43:05] love your natural children how much more
[43:08] further or greater is God's love to you
[43:11] and I am his love is so great that he
[43:14] was willing to come down and give
[43:15] himself and die for you and I amen I've
[43:19] been reading here this week on in The
[43:21] Book of Mark and how you know when Jesus
[43:24] had to stand before the Pharisees and
[43:26] the Sadducees and the scribes and I was
[43:28] looking at how they mocked him I was
[43:31] looking at how Jesus the Bible says his
[43:34] soul was sorrowful even unto death he
[43:36] was saying father if it be possible let
[43:38] this cup pass but then he said not my
[43:41] will but thy will because he know that
[43:44] the road that was in front of him was a
[43:46] hard road but he loved his children so
[43:49] much Hallelujah he loved you and I so
[43:52] much that though the road was hard he
[43:55] was willing to go the distance that you
[43:57] and I might be able to have eternal life
[44:00] this morning it was a hard Road for him
[44:03] but he was he was the example of a real
[44:05] father wasn't he come on the Bible says
[44:08] they spit on him they mocked him they
[44:11] pull hair out out of his face they hid
[44:14] him inside the head and called them all
[44:16] kind of
[44:17] names they did all kinds of things for
[44:20] him but he loved his children so much
[44:23] right he knew that if he didn't do that
[44:26] then we'd go with out come on we'd be
[44:29] especially you and I as Gentiles we'd be
[44:31] still dogs cast on out but he desired to
[44:34] bring us in he desired to clothe us
[44:37] hallelujah and give us the the bread
[44:40] that was only for the children come on
[44:43] he said it ain't meat to give the CH the
[44:45] the children's bread to the dogs but he
[44:47] desired to give you and I of that bread
[44:50] come on but it was a sacrifice he was
[44:52] going to have to go through to give his
[44:55] children that bread amen but he was
[44:57] that's the thing he was willing to do it
[44:59] though wasn't he come on we didn't have
[45:02] to beg him he did it just because that's
[45:04] what he wanted to do because he loved
[45:06] you and I Hallelujah his love just
[45:09] stretch you think about that the love of
[45:12] God the love of God stretched didn't it
[45:15] it saved the unsavable didn't it it
[45:18] loved the unlovable but God desired to
[45:20] do that right so I says that my father
[45:23] has more than enough you know I can't
[45:25] stand before you and brag on nobody else
[45:27] but Jesus Christ amen amen me and my
[45:30] wife was talking last night I said you
[45:31] know one thing you know I can only
[45:33] preach a certain way amen and then all
[45:36] the glory is got to go to God Amen it's
[45:39] got Jesus Christ is the only reason why
[45:41] I'm here today he's the only he's the
[45:44] only thing I can brag on is him because
[45:47] without him ain't nothing amen come on
[45:50] it's not about being popular and all
[45:52] these things like that who are you
[45:54] anyway nothing but dust right if he
[45:57] hadn't done what he did you wouldn't I
[45:59] wouldn't be here this morning I know I
[46:01] don't have no idea where I'd be at this
[46:04] morning because of the lifestyle I came
[46:06] from but when Jesus came along and
[46:09] that's the thing about it he didn't meet
[46:10] me in a church somewhere he didn't meet
[46:12] me in the finest suit and the biggest
[46:14] place and all that but he met me down in
[46:16] the gutter right where I was at down I
[46:19] was I was telling testimony the other
[46:21] day why because it never gets old
[46:23] telling them where God met me right
[46:25] there in a Motel 6 calling on it what it
[46:28] is my father
[46:30] Hallelujah some sometimes you got to
[46:32] shake
[46:33] yourself but we're talking here my
[46:36] father has more than enough right we see
[46:38] here you know what happened to this in
[46:41] this setting of scripture this young man
[46:44] right he was no doubt he was raised in a
[46:47] good home wasn't he and we going to talk
[46:49] about not just for the young man but the
[46:51] young girls too amen right he raised in
[46:54] a good home amen wasn't he but but it
[46:57] was something about you know maybe he
[47:00] thought he was being uh uh withheld from
[47:03] something in life right maybe can look
[47:05] at the other young people all thought
[47:08] maybe he was missing out on something
[47:10] but one thing that he that he didn't
[47:12] know and that's what I say is a lot of
[47:15] times everybody want to be grown before
[47:17] the time amen can I say it like that
[47:20] amen come on everybody want to be grown
[47:23] way before the time yeah man I want to
[47:26] do my own thing I want to but you don't
[47:29] understand what the cost is to be grown
[47:31] sometimes right can I say it like that
[47:34] this morning come on now you don't
[47:37] understand what the cost is to be grown
[47:39] sometimes you don't understand the the
[47:42] the the hard roads the long nights the
[47:47] pain the getting up doing things when
[47:49] you don't feel like it but you ain't got
[47:52] nobody else to depend on but God
[47:55] hallelujah come on you trust in him
[47:59] every day but if you out there on your
[48:00] own on the island you know you're not
[48:02] looking to God you don't
[48:04] understand sometimes everybody want to
[48:06] be grown don't they come on but the
[48:09] thing is this young man though though he
[48:12] went out he went out that and and and
[48:15] things I says that you know uh uh it was
[48:18] certain experiences in life that he had
[48:21] to try because the devil sometimes when
[48:26] you're looking at it looks like a good
[48:28] time don't it looks like the world in
[48:31] itself is they having such a good time
[48:35] but you don't see behind the
[48:37] scenes hallelujah amen you don't
[48:40] see those nights Hallelujah when danger
[48:45] was right around the corner but if it
[48:47] wasn't for the Hedge and somebody
[48:49] praying amen come on amen amen but if
[48:53] God was to lift his hands off just a
[48:55] little bit amen
[48:57] come on but what happens the devil shows
[49:00] you the good time don't it and that we
[49:02] you sometimes you can be old and the
[49:04] devil still show you that don't it but
[49:06] what it is you got to taste and see that
[49:08] the Lord is good you once you taste of
[49:11] the Lord you'll know there's nothing
[49:13] greater than what he has for you
[49:15] hallelujah amen oh Jesus but we find out
[49:19] I says that you know he went out and
[49:21] wanted to experience certain things in
[49:23] life but one thing about it when he went
[49:27] out to experience life in the Good Time
[49:31] come on he didn't know what the value
[49:35] was of what he had come on he didn't
[49:38] know it because it was given to him
[49:41] that's right so he didn't know what it
[49:43] cost to get it amen amen hallelujah amen
[49:47] so that's why he could waste it away cuz
[49:49] he didn't know the value of it sometimes
[49:52] we don't know what the value how much it
[49:54] cost amen Hal Hallelujah for us to wake
[49:58] up this morning am with good health amen
[50:02] hallelujah amen with a car to drive with
[50:05] food to eat amen we don't know what the
[50:07] cost is amen Jesus does don't he amen
[50:12] cuz he paid the price for you and I to
[50:15] have joy this morning we don't know what
[50:17] the cost is amen oh Jesus to have peace
[50:22] we don't know what that cost was it was
[50:24] a high price amen some body paid the
[50:27] price amen but when you don't know the
[50:30] value of it you'll take it for granted
[50:32] amen won't you amen come on now amen but
[50:35] I thank God every day thank you for
[50:37] paying the price amen this is the day
[50:40] that the Lord has made we'll rejoice and
[50:43] be glad therein Hallelujah come on now
[50:46] don't let me preach by myself this
[50:48] morning amen come on now do you got joy
[50:51] this morning amen come on do you have a
[50:53] smile on your face this morning do you
[50:55] have peace are you in good health this
[50:58] morning come on recognize the value of
[51:01] it the value of your health was the
[51:03] stripes that was laid on his back oh
[51:07] Jesus Lord he paid the price didn't he
[51:11] come on yes he did oh Jesus come on I
[51:16] ain't going to be guilty of not thanking
[51:18] him for paying the price am come on I
[51:22] ain't going to be guilty of not saying
[51:24] Thank You Lord amen give it God glory I
[51:28] ain't going to be guilty of it cuz I
[51:30] realize the value of it I realize where
[51:34] I should have been this morning but God
[51:36] has blessed me Hallelujah to be alive
[51:39] and
[51:40] well oh Jesus so I ain't going to waste
[51:44] my time away I ain't going to waste that
[51:47] breath away but I'm going shout
[51:49] hallelujah every time I get a chance
[51:51] amen I'm a press every time I get a
[51:54] chance Hallelujah
[51:56] [Music]
[51:57] but he didn't know the value of it did
[51:59] he come on that's why he can waste it
[52:02] away ain't it come on you know it's
[52:06] somebody in pain this
[52:08] morning you know that somebody in the
[52:11] hospital this morning
[52:13] amen somebody down in the in can we say
[52:16] down in the dumps this morning amen come
[52:18] on Amen but God has blessed you and I
[52:22] hasn't he but I says that what is he
[52:25] didn't know the value of it so he went
[52:27] when he when you don't really uh know
[52:29] the value of it you'll go away and
[52:31] you'll just waste it away right because
[52:34] it's just given but that even that
[52:37] inheritance that he got from his father
[52:40] his father had to pay a price for that
[52:42] inheritance come on but he didn't see
[52:46] that and that's what it is I said
[52:48] sometimes we just look at the glory of
[52:51] of certain things inside but we don't
[52:53] know the cost of it amen amen come on I
[52:57] thought about those Heroes of Faith in
[52:59] the
[53:00] Bible sometimes we want signs and
[53:02] wonders Miracles power to follow your
[53:05] life amen but you got to realize it was
[53:08] a cost to get that it was some
[53:11] sacrifices to get it it was some prices
[53:15] to pay wasn't it am come on no cross no
[53:19] Crown amen ain't that the truth come on
[53:23] my thought about Moses the Bible says he
[53:26] for took Egypt and all its riches yes he
[53:31] didn't want to be called Pharaoh's uh
[53:33] the son of Pharaoh's daughter he forsook
[53:35] all of that amen come on because even
[53:39] though he know what he was going into
[53:42] slavery or whatever it might have been
[53:44] but he saw value in it amen somehow in
[53:48] that he saw power in that that was
[53:52] greater than all the treasures in Egypt
[53:54] yes amen he was looking through a
[53:56] different set of eyes am hallelujah amen
[54:00] that's what we looking through this
[54:01] morning amen a different set of eyes
[54:04] amen come on many times you had
[54:07] opportunities to do certain things make
[54:10] certain money and all that but you
[54:11] forsook it Allen why because you know
[54:15] that God has something greater amen come
[54:18] on Amen I ain't got to get what the
[54:20] devil off of me and all this and make
[54:22] this up my father has more than enough
[54:25] amen oh Jesus he owns every cattle on
[54:28] the hill don't he oh Jesus God is so
[54:33] good this morning ain't he come on but
[54:36] we look at the glory but not knowing it
[54:38] was a sacrifice right people look at the
[54:41] glory of Paul's life but it was a
[54:43] sacrifice wasn't it amen come on now I'm
[54:46] talking about forsaking all
[54:49] amen these Heroes of Faith they forsook
[54:53] everything
[54:56] that's hard for people to do today amen
[54:59] come on forsake it all walk away from
[55:03] everything amen That's mighty hard to do
[55:06] today amen come on but what it is the
[55:10] only thing that'll make you do that you
[55:13] got to see what you forsaken it for is
[55:15] greater than all that amen hallelujah
[55:19] God's got to open your
[55:22] eyes that you'll be able to see oh Jesus
[55:26] Jesus
[55:27] amen oh Hallelujah am come on God got to
[55:30] open our eyes this morning don't we come
[55:33] on but what it
[55:34] is you know your running ain't in vain
[55:37] can I say that this morning come on all
[55:40] your running ain't in vain the devil
[55:42] tell you that but your running ain't in
[55:43] vain come on keep pressing God's got a
[55:46] Crown of Life stored up for you when all
[55:49] the other ones going out doing this and
[55:51] saying they having a good time and all
[55:53] that come on wait until the end now amen
[55:56] wait until the end when you hear him say
[55:59] Well done you fought you pressed you
[56:03] endured you forsook all amen hallelujah
[56:07] amen oh that's what gives me joy
[56:09] unspeakable and full of Glory because
[56:12] the devil can't lie to me enough to tell
[56:15] me that serving God ain't the right
[56:17] thing to do hallelujah oh Jesus amen
[56:21] come on now amen hallelujah amen but he
[56:26] didn't he didn't understand the value of
[56:28] what he had did he come on when you
[56:29] don't understand the value you wasted
[56:31] away won't you and that's what he did it
[56:33] didn't take long did it threw it all
[56:37] away then one of the one of the cruel
[56:41] realities that he found out was the

[1:01:01] whatever your master tell you to do come
[1:01:03] on cuz he's your master right I thought
[1:01:07] about once this happened years ago now I

[1:01:30] come back he strung out again CU of some
[1:01:32] bad doctor giving him prescriptions
[1:01:35] after prescriptions come on but he's at
[1:01:38] work one day out there at work on a
[1:01:41] little table he's telling me
[1:01:44] Ernest this is years your now is way
[1:01:47] back like an 0405 or something he say
[1:01:50] Ernest he says man try one of these
[1:01:54] pieces he said it'll take you some
[1:01:56] places man just try one please he was
[1:01:59] begging me to try a piece of that
[1:02:03] oxycotton he had it a razor blade
[1:02:06] cutting it in four
[1:02:07] pieces and I said no I don't think I'm
[1:02:10] going to try none of
[1:02:11] that I hadn't been saved too long but
[1:02:15] what God had did for me I knew was way
[1:02:18] better than those
[1:02:19] oxycotton come on Amen but a forlift
[1:02:23] came by and swung Ron and they exhaust
[1:02:26] from it blew all those pills off the
[1:02:29] table I walked off because he
[1:02:33] panicked
[1:02:35] but what what the Lord allowed me to
[1:02:38] see when I walked off and I turned
[1:02:41] around you know that boy was on his
[1:02:44] knees digging through the dirt looking
[1:02:46] for those
[1:02:49] pieces I sat there and watched him for a
[1:02:52] while digging through the dirt looking
[1:02:54] for those pieces
[1:02:56] and he think I think he found all of
[1:02:57] them but one but he was upset they
[1:03:00] little tiny little pieces digging
[1:03:01] through the dirt looking for
[1:03:03] them what it was his
[1:03:06] master come on Amen had a hold on him
[1:03:10] maybe if you have told him he'd be like
[1:03:12] that one day maybe he have told you I'd
[1:03:14] never go that distance that's right
[1:03:16] that's right come on but when the master
[1:03:19] when the demon with the addiction
[1:03:21] somebody introduced it to him somewhere
[1:03:24] somehow amen amen come on Amen and it
[1:03:27] had such a stronghold on his life amen
[1:03:30] he diging through the dirt looking for
[1:03:32] it amen come on amen he used to tell me

[1:03:46] he met me one day and asked me to come
[1:03:48] pray with him I prayed with him just
[1:03:49] hard as I could in the bathroom because
[1:03:52] I knew that what it was the devil had
[1:03:55] hold to him
[1:03:57] he wasn't born like that something
[1:03:59] happened to him come on he came from a
[1:04:03] good family had
[1:04:05] money come
[1:04:07] on but when the devil get hold to you he
[1:04:10] don't care what family you part of he
[1:04:13] don't care if your daddy's a preacher
[1:04:15] your daddy's a bishop or whoever amen
[1:04:18] amen the Devil is a devil amen come
[1:04:24] on but pray Prayer Changes Things amen
[1:04:28] prayer Hallelujah has a way to break
[1:04:31] yolks amen unhooked
[1:04:33] chains oh Jesus amen I like how Moses
[1:04:38] message was Let My People Go hallelujah
[1:04:40] amen amen you've been holding them long
[1:04:43] enough let them go amen that they might
[1:04:46] serve the Living God how many want to be
[1:04:49] let go this morning oh Jesus come on now
[1:04:54] Lord but what happens I says that the
[1:04:57] devil will take you that far he had this
[1:04:59] young man that far didn't he come on but
[1:05:02] one thing about it I like how the Bible
[1:05:04] I like how the Bible says you know when
[1:05:07] when he came to himself come
[1:05:09] on when he when he shook himself come on
[1:05:13] and maybe maybe shaking himself just
[1:05:16] dramatizing it he thought about the good
[1:05:18] times in his father's house amen
[1:05:22] hallelujah come on he went back in his
[1:05:25] mind maybe of the good times Amen in his
[1:05:29] father's house he thought about all his
[1:05:32] wrongs and where it all started at come
[1:05:36] on amen he thought about it
[1:05:41] Hallelujah I think about Samson standing
[1:05:44] there with his with his locks cut off
[1:05:46] sometimes come on but in his eyes
[1:05:49] plucked out but in memory Hallelujah he
[1:05:53] can remember when God used to use
[1:05:56] am he can remember the anointing and how
[1:05:59] good it felt to praise the Lord oh Jesus
[1:06:04] come
[1:06:04] on the me the mind is a powerful thing
[1:06:08] ain't it but something clicked with on
[1:06:12] the inside of him I Believe come on he
[1:06:15] begin to say in My Father's House amen
[1:06:18] hallelujah amen he's got more than
[1:06:21] enough I said my father has more than
[1:06:24] enough this morning amen come on I'm out
[1:06:28] here perishing with Hunger amen bounded
[1:06:32] to the devil all these things but in my
[1:06:35] father's house he has more than enough
[1:06:39] I'm going home hallelujah amen oh Jesus
[1:06:43] thank you Lord I'm going home Hallelujah
[1:06:47] you know one thing about it I says the
[1:06:51] road back was through repentance amen
[1:06:55] amen come on Amen it wasn't just I'm
[1:06:58] going go back and just be back like that
[1:07:00] but the road back started with
[1:07:01] repentance amen amen come on I believe
[1:07:05] in that boy's heart he was sorry for
[1:07:07] what he did Amen in that boy's heart
[1:07:11] Hallelujah he had done been through a
[1:07:13] couple things now he was sorry for what
[1:07:15] he did amen
[1:07:17] hallelujah he was willing to do whatever
[1:07:20] it took to get back Hallelujah that road
[1:07:23] of repentance sometimes is a lonely road
[1:07:26] it's always a lonely road because you
[1:07:28] did the sin and now you got to do the
[1:07:31] repent make it right Hallelujah but one
[1:07:35] thing about our god he's a merciful god
[1:07:38] one thing about our father he's a
[1:07:40] merciful father now amen amen ain't he
[1:07:45] Hallelujah but it was a road back that
[1:07:49] road back was through repentance wasn't
[1:07:51] it come on Godly sorry something in this
[1:07:55] something not I said something in him
[1:07:56] clicked I like that how the Bible says
[1:07:59] he when he he got hold to himself he
[1:08:01] shook himself something clicked right
[1:08:04] but he was willing to go back he said
[1:08:06] when he was going back Hallelujah one
[1:08:08] thing about a good father good father
[1:08:11] ain't going to turn a child down come on
[1:08:14] especially you see that child child
[1:08:16] trying good father ain't going to put
[1:08:18] that child down amen come on but the
[1:08:21] Bible says when the father seen him he
[1:08:23] was still yet a far off
[1:08:26] but the father recognized him didn't he
[1:08:29] come on now amen saw him coming and with
[1:08:33] joy ran to meet him yes Lord didn't he
[1:08:37] come on but like I said that boy had
[1:08:40] come to a true
[1:08:42] repentance come on he was willing to
[1:08:45] make things right he said I ain't even
[1:08:47] no more worthy to be called your son am
[1:08:50] come on but the thing is once a son you
[1:08:53] always a son come on come on
[1:08:56] now you might have lost your way but
[1:08:59] find your way back
[1:09:00] home come on find your way back that
[1:09:04] back down that road to repentance find
[1:09:07] your way back down to the
[1:09:09] Cross to his bleeding
[1:09:11] side
[1:09:13] hallelujah oh when the presence of God
[1:09:16] comes down then you might know people
[1:09:19] think because you look the same and all
[1:09:22] that but something
[1:09:24] changed h Hallelujah that's what's got
[1:09:27] to happen ch's got to
[1:09:29] change Hallelujah so many people uh they
[1:09:33] make dry confessions and all these
[1:09:35] things which may be all right but
[1:09:38] something's got to
[1:09:39] change because if it don't change you'll

[1:10:14] was just praying and just meditating on
[1:10:16] that I says that way back he wasn't
[1:10:20] maybe like how he left running and
[1:10:22] jumping and ready to go that live away
[1:10:26] and ride his living and all these things
[1:10:28] but that road back maybe he was beat
[1:10:31] down come on he didn't have no money
[1:10:35] Dragon ragged clothes whatever it might
[1:10:39] have been but the only thing about it he
[1:10:42] was driven to go back come on something
[1:10:46] on the inside of him was driving him to
[1:10:48] make it back if I can only make it back
[1:10:50] to my father's house he was driven
[1:10:53] Hallelujah to go back
[1:10:56] but when he got back things changed than
