the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen God bless you may me SE I talked last night in marins about being rooted and grounded in love amen so we thought we talk today uh tonight about you know about the love of God going beyond the curtains of time going beyond the curtains of time amen it's it's a need in this last hour where there's so much hate walls and room of walls violence everywhere amen think the prophet of God says the bride would be the only one that have the love of God are you with me and I want to know are you bride amen it's not what you say amen amen see he said Jacob have our love and Esau we love him because he first us he first loved uslu are you with me so it's a love that God had for us and even when we were yet sinners and enemies in our minds by Wicked Works Christ loved us am and he died for us amen are you with me amen so beyond the curtains of time going beyond the curtains of time what is that really we talking about Out of Body Experience the prophet had that he was talking about Paul caught up in the third heaven in the body out the body that cannot tell whether sleep awake or in a vision he says but I left I saw my body laying on the bed and I went to a place and he calls it beyond the curtains of time and he says he went there and he he described the place somewhat like this he said I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preach was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love are you with me this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it amen so he says I'm more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to ENT it there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could ever enter there m ality could never make you old and they could not cry it was just one Joy precious brother amen so it was a place that he was driving that words cannot explain amen amen he said it wasn't even in the anguage Ang English language to be able to explain amen that kind of place that he was in so he was talking about he says there there nothing could be sin and everything was perfect love if we if if I could try to say it was Perfection that would meet meet it Sublime that couldn't meet it I just don't know if there's a words that I know in the English dialect that could express the place what the place was I never seen heard or thought anything like it brother and sister that's what you we want to go if we leave here now we want to pass from time into eternity amen and nothing but perfect love can get there and I'm saying there's a there's a cry amen the problems that I was telling in Mullins the problems that I keep stressing it's nothing wrong with God it's nothing wrong with uh sometimes the church or nothing wrong with the word of God it's that how we look at the thing how we look he said you know IM Look Away to Jesus he said cause them what you're looking for he said when you look away to Jesus is Calling what you're looking for and if you looking to see Jesus if you looking Amen to see the word manifest if whatever you're looking for you get what you expect isn't that right amen if you expecting something from God but if you come unexpecting you don't want nothing you don't need nothing but when you come under expectation that I need something from God am the Bible tells us judgment begins at the house of God and if it first begin at us what should the end be and if the righteousness scarcely that's right be saved where said The Sinner ungodly appear amen if we can only just make it Amen brother and sister when God is calling us to be rooted amen grounded in love amen praise God you know somebody's got it all they got they they've got so much love until it it just it's just flowing everywhere it just it's flowing like Rivers so much love you can feel the love coming from them because they got so much love and uh everybody wants to embrace that kind of joy that kind of peace that kind of place because it's just a a presence it's just something about you it's a presence that you carry with you they don't feel like uh uh you don't like them you hate them you you got something against them they feel oh the love of God he says there's no fear in love for perfect love cast out fear for fear has torment amen yes sir when there's a fear there's a lack of love amen a lack of the love of God that's why amen I was talking last night about the parent n Spirit people think somebody's against them that's what you call I remember we had a patient that they said uh you know had a lot of mental problems and we haven't seen anything out of disspation he was about 6'4 what about 250 we never seen the problem so that man ain't crazy you know back then you can call somebody crazy I can't call him crazy now Rachel done talk me about I got to use a different type of of terminology you know what I'm saying but let me see you know fell all right I don't even know why he here until one day in the cafeteria all of a sudden he took and no knocked a Man Out boom he knocked himself so I think blood was gushing he said he put something in my food I and I said oh that's good there it is it come out all of this time we been months ain't never seen nothing oh they got they wrong diagnosis they got this fell here for nothing and we had all the people that killed people chopped people up and all we had all the worst patience it was Max in security everything had to be locked down some people we had it just in a just in a cage no you couldn't go to the bathroom you couldn't take a bath you couldn't do nothing we just give you a pot and put it through the hole because and then when you act up we got to open the door and got to go in they and they shoot him up with some thorine and I and sometimes you had to pray hard and when you open that door you had to get some help so some of the patience was you didn't have enough employees you just had to employ some patience to help you cuz if they acing up I remember one time this fell was 66 or so and and he wor by 300 and something pound and he was taking his head hitting up against the wall and knocking holes in the wall and and nothing would happen to his head he didn't see no blood no nothing and he took the balls the steel balls and the bricks start coming so we had to go in there we got to go it's time to go because he going to take he going he going to take the wall down and the bars down so before he took the bars down I had one of my what we call my home boys I know he was scared cuz he used to be scared of his shadow but he was a tough fell inside that institution he said to the patient he said look at man he called him by his name we coming in now and we we want you to lay down on that mattress because all they had was a blow it up mattress and uh the patient he said yes Mama he called him his mama and he laid down so gentle and they just took the third scene and Sh thank the Lord how somebody praying I guess all usse is praying God have mercy thank you Jesus that this this fell thought that was his mama I don't know what he were looking at but I thank God for but some of the things when you so far gone and we're dealing with the devil that injects uh himself false thoughts keeping you from loving one another amen Amen brother are you with me amen so the devil inject his thoughts into your mind thinking somebody get you you know well I know I know I got discernment spiritual discernment I discern I know you I know who you are cuz I got the gift of discernment you know you know so many you know it's hard brother the prophet of God said the worst Spirit you can deal with is a religious spirit amen he said you can't he can't hly cast out a religious spirit because they think that it's God and see the right kind of spirit perfect love and the right kind of spirit would the prophet said you get on your knees when your brother wrong you your enemy against you you get on your knees and you'll pray Lord help them amen you begin to cry out for them you wouldn't treat a mean and and go around and try to kill every fact you'll you you'll get out on your knees because you got perfect love then but when you don't have perfect love you know what I I'm just waiting on God to avenge you know under the fifth seal they say how long oh Lord will your avengeance amen and he said just a little while ain't that right a and you those under the altar cried out for vengeance amen and some people they under the altar they must be Jews come on brother they they cry out I for an eye and a two for You2 you did it for me and I'm going do it to you that's right sir it must be Jews but if it was the bride there would be it would be Christ that Christ May dwell in you your heart amen amen the love of God that Christ May dwell in you amen amen because it's the love of God that passes knowledge amen amen sometimes we think we know but it it the love of God passes knowledge the love of Christ amen Amen Let It dwell in you amen but instead amen we hold on to a spirit that it's all right we we happy people can be happy they take those spirits and they'll walk with those spirits and you know until those Spirits are released it's almost like the lunatic man that's wanted to U punch the prophet he said you'll fall on my feet but it's it's it's like that he said is the devil going to know he loves that spirit and a lot of times people that think they're religious they got to hold to those Spirits I ain't going to let this go I know I DET turn right I know I'm right right what I know I'm telling the truth what truth hey it's all right it's all right oh calm down it's all right praise God but you see you have to deal with that until a person get the Holy Ghost you have to try to talk them into being calm being cool and Collective you know it's going to be all right we know you're a baby and babies do these things he said when I was a child I thought as a child amen amen and now we see through a glass Darkly but when I became a man I put away child amen we know that when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be what done away with so we're living in a day amen that it's you know we talking about the seventh day going back to the eighth day and living beyond the curtains of time we're talking about going back to the eternity are you with me amen and when we talk about the eighth day we talking about the first day are you with me so what's going on is that people amen are are living amen under the age of Amen law and not Grace and if we understood the grace of God now this is why Paul says here he says that excuse me he says in the 16th verse that he would Grant you God got to granted to you that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might by his spirit in the Inner Man see it takes the spirit to give you strength that's right amen without the spirit of God you you'll come sh of the love of God true amen amen and when we talk about perfect love you don't have it you w Bor with it amen it doesn't matter how you practice how much of the Bible you believe how much tongue you speak in how much you shout how much you dance how much you prophesy when you cast out Devils when we talk about perfect law we talk about something beyond that amen amen the gifts are all right but we talking about Beyond gifts amen are you with me amen I thank God for the gifts and I want the gift to be in operation but I'm talking about beyond the gifts amen amen pray amen whether there be tongues there Seas whether there be you said if I have faith I can move mountains and if I have the gift of oh prophecy amen and understand all Mysteries oh I can tell you what the Seven Seals seven thumb seven this I can tell you all that ien understand not all Mysteries and have not chared Prophet me nothing so what is it that God is trying to get you and I too he said this is what you preach perfect love amen is the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes this is what you preach amen you got to have perfect love the Holy Ghost is amen are you with me amen so the Holy Ghost does not behave itself unseemly amen it's not easily provoked amen it's not puffed up amen amen praise God and we got to Die daily we got to die to ourselves we got to come to a place that amen we're not looking to ourselves amen you know I sang me a little song you can't take it with you when you go you can't take your money with you when you go you can't take your house with you when you go are you
