god for brother jason and brother mitchell from charlotte amen and jason is originally from kenya been over here a good pretty good while and uh you see a little stage a little shy was talking so we're gonna ask brother mitch to come up and give his testimony before the word come forth tonight ex-brother mitchell from charlotte he'll tell you where he's originally from [Applause] amen um i'm only gonna be up here for like 10 minutes um well my name is mitch mitchell i'm originally from philadelphia um born and raised i moved to charlotte north carolina in may of 2020. i got saved in june i got saved in june of 2020. um kind of during the pandemic um well first my story i gotta say when i was six years old um my grandmother said i got saved at six years old um and from there you know god started using me um you know i was executing prophesying words and they would come forth and um immediately the enemy started coming in my life at about i would say 13. um i met the wrong crowd started drinking you know um smoking doing drugs um hanging with the wrong people and um i just remember at 19 years old like i completely turned away from god you know god was always in my heart but it got to the point where i just completely forgot everything i was taught you know um just totally forgot about him and um from 19 to i would say about 28 i was on cocaine um addicted to alcohol um just you know in fornication just just doing anything you can imagine in a gang selling drugs doing drugs um and um i just remember one night i got drunk and i did some uh i did some cocaine and i almost i would say it was almost like an overdose but you know as it was happening i remember the ambulance came and looked at my face and he said he said where are you on and i just kept remember thinking that i'm about to die so immediately i started my heart repenting asking god to forgive me for you know um anything i could think about and that and that reminded me that that god was always in my heart still as i was doing what i was doing for me to immediately call on him during the situation um so after the situation ended um came home from the hospital my grandma called me and she said um the lord what you say so um y'all repeated the prayer you know uh with the prayers she had me repeat i repeat it you know didn't mean it from my heart still went back to the life i was living and um i just remember one night i kind of woke up on the couch at like three o'clock in the morning and it's like i woke up sober i went to bed drunk and high woke up sober and i just remember like my life flashed in front of my eyes i seen from the time i was a little boy until up until um the night i was on the couch and i just something snapped in my head and i realized that you know with how i was living it wasn't me i called my sister and i told her i said whatever prayer i repeated when i was young um i said send me that prayer i said you know i need to get saved i said you know the way i'm living is not me so i remember she sent it to me and i went upstairs in the bathroom not and i just started crying i sat in the tub and i just started crying crying calling up to god i said you know what's the purpose of all this i said if i'm going to be still addicted to cigarettes bound by alcohol um you know mine all over the place drinking smoke and selling drugs i said what's the point of you like what's the point of you you know me being saved i said if you're not going to take all this away from me i don't want nothing to do with you so um i said what i said to him i repeated the prayer and um i walked out the bathroom and i remember i went to sleep and i woke up the next morning and it was like um the first thing i usually wake up i ran that time the first thing i did when i woke up with smoked a cigarette i had a shot of any kind of alcohol that i had you know i went to go try to smoke a cigarette and it's like the taste was completely gone on my mouth like i i didn't even want it the desire for it was gone i went in the kitchen and tried to pour a shot and i just looked and i was like and i put the bottle down i just walked outside and i i tried to um i tried to smoke another cigar i tried to light it no interest no interest in the cigarette so you know um as the day went by i began telling my friend i said let's go get some drinks couldn't even go do that the whole the tote the interest was gone from drinks you know i didn't want no more weed even cocaine it just totally just like everything just left my mind it was broken off me like that night but i didn't realize it until i kept trying to do those things and i couldn't do them no more but um yeah to this day i never touched on that stuff again you know it was like it didn't have a hold on me i wasn't bound by it no more and i was a borderline alcoholic so for me to not want to drink i knew that was god so um yeah and all my friends just seen a change in my life and they started coming to me for prayer and you know asking me like you know how did you change i you know you was you was alcoholic and you was just you know and i told him you know i got saved and you know jesus really changed my life so to this day i'm ministering to like young guys like jason is um one of the young guys i'm disciplined right now um i got a few other young guys i discipled that that dealt with the same things that i dealt with you know and don't believe that they can be free and i let them know that you know look at me i'm from the streets i'm from the projects in north philadelphia like i was bound by drugs alcohol if god set me free you know respected persons he could do the same for you so ladies and gents brother holloway he's coming from brother michael holloway charlotte north carolina praise god i appreciate uh brother mitchell amen and god is a god he's a deliverer amen well i'm so glad she just set me free [Music] [Music] peace [Music] me [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the lord you may be seated for a minute amen i appreciate the opportunity to be here appreciate hearing that testimony my brother amen amen i i enjoy hearing that there's still power to deliver amen amen it's sometimes easy to get a person to come to church but deliverance is real amen i'm glad to hear our brother's testimony i appreciate the opportunity it's been a little while since we've been a fellowship with you it's been a good little while matter of fact uh it's my first time seeing this this building amen so so uh that that kind of dates it a little bit amen amen so uh but uh appreciate being here i was kind of glad to see brother gordon sitting back there i was gonna ask if uh he would sing a song but uh i think for time's sake maybe we'll uh will not do that but uh i didn't know he'd be here tonight and i walked out and saw him i said maybe i might be able to get him to give us a special before we bring forth the word but appreciate the opportunity to be here appreciate the fellowship brother simmons as always so uh certainly ask your prayers tonight that you pray with us pull on the gift amen and ask just talk to god let him know what you need and he's able to direct the word direct to gift to go wherever he needs to go amen that's not that's not ability of a man that's going to take the holy ghost to do that so uh so i'll certainly actually prayers and uh and uh won't prolong the time i actually if you have your bibles you can stand with me amen glad to have my excuse i'm glad to have my wife with me amen it's not too many times in my life i've ministered and she wasn't there but it's been a few but uh but i'm glad as always to have her have her here with me tonight we're going to look at the scriptures first corinthians chapter 1 verse 4. and we're going to read just a few verses now that you have your seats first corinthians chapter 4 verse 14 and before we read i'ma approach our lord in the word prayer dear heavenly father we want to come before you tonight lord and give thanks thank you for your amazing grace thank you for your power that still saves that still delivers that changes the hearts and takes the desire out of a man lord i thank you for that tonight lord we all need another dose of that tonight lord that same holy spirit oh god that touched our brother lord it still moves even on those that have been saved for years lord we can never have too much of that spirit just to anoint us a fresh god to give us a fresh hunger for the word a first hunger for your righteousness a hunger to serve you in a world that's dying lord god we desire that tonight so lord i ask your grace in the name of jesus christ may your spirit have preeminence tonight lord may you use your word to wash us afresh may we leave hero god with a greater zeal or greater desire o god recognizing who we are and recognizing the hour in which you place us here upon earth we're not here by chance god but we're here by your divine predestination lord that you put us here for this hour for a specific purpose lord tonight we look to you we act your grace in all things bless this service help me step aside lord and may you use your gift in jesus christ's name we exit amen amen first corinthians chapter 4 verse 14. and jesus follows i write not these things to shame you but in my beloved sons i warn you not now you know this book of corinthians is referred to as a book of correction there's a lot of things that were not in the best let's say the right order in the corinthians church and so paul was writing to them corrected him on a lot of things and so when paul says i'm not writing these things to shame you he's he's writing correction but he's writing correction out of love i want you to understand where he's coming from he says but i write unto you as my beloved sons i warn you for though ye may have ten thousand instructors in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel wherefore i beseech you be followers of me bower heads dear heavenly father lord i want to give you thanks for your grace thank you for your word thank you for your holy spirit lord may your spirit have premised tonight take your word make it real to every one of our hearts we asked in jesus christ's name amen and i'm gonna amen a title for my thought tonight my title is leadership leadership and for a subtitle correctly dedicated to the word of god correctly dedicated to the word of god you know many people are dedicated to a lot of things in life some are dedicated to job careers some are dedicated to family that's very noble some may even be dedicated to the church there's a lot of things a person can be dedicated to but not always the the right dedication we find out paul was a very dedicated man once paul was dedicated to the pharisees way of doing things and he was so much dedicated to it that he was actually persecuting the church of god for preaching jesus christ but paul came to a spot that we recognize that though he was dedicated he found out he wasn't dedicated in the right way we found out from the scriptures that there was a prophet by the name of isaiah one time isaiah was prophet was a prophet and he lived at the same time as king josiah and we found out the bible said in the day that king azia died isaiah said i found the lord he was a very dedicated young prophet he was dedicated to the king he was dedicated to the king's kingdom but when naziah died he realized that there was a greater dedication than king uzziah or you follow me and so even though he was dedicated to a good thing he found out there was a better thing to be dedicated to not a natural king but a king of kings jesus christ so you follow me so dedication is a good thing but to be correctly dedicated listen to be correctly dedicated is much better and when it comes to the word in order to be correctly dedicated there's only one way that can come about that's by leadership it's going to take leadership why do we need leadership why is leadership so important leadership is necessary to provide guidance guidance is required when you're trying to reach a specific goal or a specific objective and it's especially necessary when you got more than one person involved whenever you got a group of people you're going to need leadership in order to bring a group of people to a unified mind to a unified vision to a unified purpose that just don't come by osmosis and people conversating with each other it's going to take a vision to bring those people together that takes leadership and it's needed to maintain unity and focus whenever there's a vision you know i made a comment this is my first time in this new church you know the last time i think i was down this way was brother chisholm's funeral that's been a little while back and the funeral is held in the other building but this building was already under construction and only thing they had in here was sheetrock and that's how far back that was and i remember coming through and brother simmons gave me a little quick tour and i saw what was going up but but but in order to to build this church somebody had to have a vision and i remember when i was talking to brother simmons this was probably even four or five years prior to that we had come down to print minister one service and we were sitting back in his pastor's study and he pulled out some plans and he was telling me brother mike he said i'm trying to get this church built and i've i've kind of got some things i need to get done i'm trying to find me an architect to help me take these plans and perfect them and take them to the next level so i can go on and get this thing contracted and when he began to show the plans i'll be honest i didn't know what i was looking at but but but whoever drafted those plans listen now had a vision they saw this building before the building was ever built they knew where the wires would be they knew what the lights would be they knew the doors would be are you following me they knew how the platform would be they knew all about this building somebody had drove the whole thing out completely before they was ever the first priest of mortar brought onto this property before it was the first piece of wood brothers probably somebody had to see that and then that vision was then communicated and turned over to the hands of somebody it was turned to the hands of your pastor and your pastor had this vision it was on a piece of paper but then now get this he had to rally the people around him to agree with his vision he said this is what i wanted to accomplish this is what i want to build and in order for him to do it he couldn't do it by himself it was going to take a group of people to bring that vision to pass so as a leader guess what he had to be anointed to bring a people together to say you know what i want to be a part of this vision and then they cooperated and participated in what they contributed time they contributed resources all these things would happen to what to bring to pass a vision or you follow me but in order to happen one person couldn't say i want to see the building facing this way one couldn't say i want to see it facing that way one couldn't say i want one door on the back one can say i want somebody had to have a vision and then the vision had to be presented and then somebody had to say i agree with that vision and they were willing to walk according to what was already laid out in that plan that was the only way this building was going to come about somebody had to buy into the vision then everybody had to walk in one accord and say i agree with that vision or you follow me that takes leadership that takes leadership and so we want to talk about leadership leadership is needed to keep to present a vision and then to keep that vision on track that takes leadership it takes somebody that has the ability to lead and somebody that's willing to stand behind leadership and say i'm willing to be a follower or you follow me so when paul said follow me paul wasn't trying to build a church for himself paul wasn't trying to build a name for himself paul was actually trying to say i've been commissioned as a leader in this generation and in order for me to bring about the vision that god has given me i'm going to need somebody to follow me to bring this vision to pass are you following me so paul wasn't saying follow the flesh paul was saying i've got a vision i want you to buy into this vision and follow me i want you to watch this he wasn't trying to get you to follow him watch what he says in the same book the first corinthians in chapter 11 verse 1. paul says he repeats this same statement again paul says be followers of me but this time he kind of clarifies it a little bit he said be followers of me as i am of christ what was he saying he had met that pill of fire and that pillow fired tow paul paul there's a specific thing i want to accomplish in your generation and i'm sending you as a man to accomplish that thing that i want to bring to pass so paul wasn't coming out preaching a message for him his own self he had been given a vision by almighty god and god said paul this is my vision for that generation and paul was looking for a people who was willing to follow that vision and paul said if you believe god is sin to me if you believe i've been anointed for this that bill follow me because god has given me the vision and you're gonna be the people that's gonna help me bring this vision to pass i want you to watch this peter never said follow me peter was an apostle peter wrote two books of the bible peter never said follow me john was an apostle and a prophet he wrote the book of revelations john was an apostle and a prophet and he wrote three books of the bible he never said follow me why would paul feel so emboldened by the holy ghost not by his own penmanship but about four or five times in the bible paul heard these words if you want to serve god follow me if you want to know god follow me if you want the power of god follow me what will make a man tell a people such a thing as that that man had to have a revelation he knew he had a vision of thus saith the lord and whenever thus sailed lord is received and whenever thus said lord has acted on you'll always find the power of god come down upon thus far the lord if it's received and acted upon in the right way when cain and abel came out in the first book of the bible and worshiped god why did abel have a vindication because he wasn't operating by his own desire he was operating by a revelation when he built that altar he had thus said the lord cain had presumptions cain had ideas but he didn't have dust shared the lord when isaiah i mean asked isaiah when elijah came out and 400 prophets of baal why was it that it's only out of one out of 400 prophets against one why was it that one man had a pill of fire because he had thus said the lord and when thus said the lord is carried out you watch god that pleases the father and he comes down and dwells with those people and i want you to watch this paul said follow me paul wrote several books of the new testament paul was a preacher but he was more than a preacher paul was an apostle he was more than apostle paul had the gift of prophecy he was more than a prophet what made him more because paul had been given the revelation listen now for that age acabus was a prophet he never said follow me i want you to catch where i'm coming from now activists never had the revelation of god for that age against had a visitation and god told agaves i want you to go down here and i want you to be paul and i want you to baptize in the name of jesus christ for the remission of his sins and i'm going to give that man the holy ghost angebus already had the holy ghost but he didn't never say follow me why because god revealed the echoes this man is going to suffer many things my name because there's something i'm about to do that's going to set a tremble throughout israel i want you to watch this even the activists of prophet didn't know what that revelation was because that revelation wouldn't come to being until god called paul and when he called paulista paul i've ordained a messenger to the gentiles why because i'm turning a corner i'm not going the way of the old testament prophets i'm not going to wear the jews i'm not going to wear the law of moses i'm getting to turn the corner i'm turning the corner of grace and this grace isn't going to the jews it's not going to your brothers it's going to the gentiles and nobody knew that but paul why because he was ordained to bring that vision to that age to that generation and so if somebody would have tried to rebuild a jewish church they'd have been off the word they'd try to rebuild everything around the jewish law they'd been off the word but if you wanted thus saith the lord there was a man that god chose to bring that revelation and that man's name was the apostle paul that was a different revelation they had churches they had prophets they had laws but they never had a gentile bride that was a new thing and paul was ordained to be the man to bring that thing to pass now i want you to watch this paul was a messenger that age and he had a vision it was a new direction paul's vision was to bring a gentile people to the word of god for that age now i want you to watch as a leader what paul had to contend with when a man gets anointed like that sometimes people take their northern man and they get it out of position they start to focus too much on the man and not on god using the man there's a difference than the flesh and there's a difference than an anointing that's using the flesh or you follow me when you go to brother simmons house you might talk to him and say brother simmons and you might cut a joke with him but when he's had to pull up and that anointing is upon him i would have dare you not to cut a joke with him at that time while under the anointing it's a different it's a different thing why god now is using that tabernacle and then when god began to use paul to bring forth his vision for that age the people that age began to get out of line and some began to say i'm a paul and i'm of apollos why they begin to look at how god was using these men and they began to get the ministry out of line why because they didn't have the revelation of what god was actually doing they could see the man operating but they couldn't catch the revelation of what god was revealing by vision and so paul as a man had to deal with that he said have i ever baptized you did i save you did i die for your sins paul had to give them back in line yes i've got the revelation yes i'm bringing a vision but you got to catch a vision of exactly what i'm bringing you otherwise you'll get out of line following the man and not following the message that the man is bringing many of these people that paul wrote to him said follow me paul never shook their hands paul never broke bread with them they never got baptized by paul they never met paul they may have gotten saved to come in later on many years that the paul never came back to corinthians after that point but yet they believed what paul preached and they were followers of his message and paul was addressing that group you may have ten thousand instructors oh you'll have preachers after preachers of preachers and good ones too brother ernest good ones passed out the pastor you and good ones good men of god but they were ordained to bring you a message and the message that he ordained to bring was my vision for this age and that vision of the age didn't come by ten thousand men it came by one man and that man's name was paul or you follow me and so paul was given a ministry to bring all these different people together listen under a unity of faith that christ in that age might be made manifested or you follow me let me keep going paul had the mind of god he wasn't just bringing preaching he was bringing the vision from the mind of god thus said the lord for that age and what was he doing building a gentile bride and this age that we're living in it also needed a vision we had baptists they had visions we've got methodists they had visions we had apostolic they had visions jehovah witness seven day events on and on and on each church had built a platform for their vision but none of them had the vision of what god actually it or you follow me so god had to send one man anointed with his spirit that had the revelation and ability to take this word and to bring certain scriptures together to bring forth the vision of god for this age paul didn't do it by his intellect he was a man that was much learned far beyond many teachers of his age but it wasn't his intellect that was able to catch the vision it was the holy ghost that came upon paul that revealed to paul this is my vision for this age and paul stayed with that holy ghost teaching to make sure that people were dressed in the word of god that god wanted to see and walk in for the age in which paul was living and so god in his last days in order to get a people ready for a bride ready for a rapture ready to get out of here god wanted to see people dressed a certain way walk a certain way act a certain way and live a certain way and god said i've got to send a message an open vision listen to church and open vision to this generation that they might know just said the lord and open visions don't come by teachers they don't come by apostles they don't come by pastors open visions only come by thus said the lord and that takes the prophet of god now let me keep going let me keep going this prophet has a calling his car is to bring the people to a vision the vision that god had for this age didn't come about last year it didn't come about ten years ago it didn't come about a hundred years ago the vision god had for this age listen was in his mind before the foundation of the world before the world began the bible said he saw the end from the beginning and being that he could see the end from beginning he mapped out every age after every age after every age he saw the day he created adam he saw the day adam fall he saw the day he created eve he saw the dates took eve out of the body and the day she failed are you following me he saw the day that in which he gave uh the vindication of abel and the day in which he rejected cain god saw everything happening day after day week after week years here all the way down until the end of time where there shall be time no more and all things be brought back unto him god saw the complete plan and then he wrote it out in a vision brother simmons just like that man wrote this church out said brother simmons you told me what you wanted how does this look and brother simmons says that's what i had in mind god called prophets they wrote the word and said god this is what you gave us this is what you revealed to us and they wrote god's thoughts listen in a book called the scriptures and what was god doing he was writing out the plan for the entire human race from the beginning of genesis all the way to the last one in revelations every generation has been identified in the scriptures and what god wants you to do listen and what god wants me to do is be able to identify ourself in our age in the word when christ came 2000 years ago what did he rebuke that church world for he said if you only knew the day of your visitation you know when the sun's shining in the rain this thing the sun shines low that it's going to be rain tomorrow and you know when the wind blows a certain way certain things you have tomorrow he said but can't you discern the signs of the time they couldn't recognize the day in which the scripture for their generation was being fulfilled but yet it was perfectly the plan in the mind of god thank you brother you see where i'm coming from it wasn't a new vision isaiah talked about it malachi talked about it jeremiah talked about it and jesus christ was limited to the letter and yet people could see it and not recognize the vision of god the word of god was unfolding but john the baptist being a prophet he recognized it he said there's one standing among you that you don't even know but being i'm a prophet i recognize the word when it comes to me the pharisees couldn't do it the sadducees couldn't do it but john was built as a prophet to do it why is that let me show you something let's go to the book of oh i believe it's the book of amos amos chapter 3. and i want you to follow me for a little bit i'm bringing us to a point amos chapter 3 you see you are in god's mind before the foundation of the world paul wrote in ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 god chose you in christ jesus before the foundation of the world well if he chose me brother ernest what in the world did he choose me to do what in the world does he want of me if he told he chose paul to be an apostle and an angel messenger unto a first age to bring the gentiles to christ that's what he chose paul for but brother simmons what did he choose me for if he had me in his mind before the foundation of the world what was he thinking about me i have no way of going back there i have no way of looking past a partial time so god said i provided a way for every generation to know what i'm thinking i'm going to give you a portal a way for my word of god to come to your generation that somebody could speak to you and say brother holloway this is what god thinks to you and if i'm obtained to that when i hear those words like that brother said something in him told him you weren't ordained to live like that you could have been that way for another 10 years but that voice would have never stopped you were not ordained to live like that something on the inside has to call you and say come out of that my people that's a predestination and for ordained election of god why does every family member not grab it why does every friend not grab it everybody doesn't have this in them but it's ordained to a certain people and you're that people before i read aim at three let me read one scripture to you matthew 13 10 watch the paul says why watch christ says about this and the disciples came to him matthew 13 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speaker thoughts of them in parables when you're preaching to the public why don't you talk plainer to them like you talk to us why do you have to use parables watch what he says and he answered and said unto them because it is given to you to know the message of the kingdom of heaven but unto them it is not given god has some people to reveal it to and some people he's going to hide it from that's his election i can't judge him on that i can't question all that if he's sovereign that's his sovereignty i show whom i love my love i precious my person that's the election of god can only thank god tonight that he called me to be one of them or you follow me but in order for me to catch what's in the mind of god the bible said that my name listen your name if you want to his was written on the land's book of life before the foundation of the world what god thought about you he already had written in a book well how am i gonna know what's in that book god said i'm gonna send you eyes a seer somebody that can see beyond the realm of flesh they can see beyond the realm of time that that was built that their mind could tap into eternity and see what i was thinking before the foundation of the world these men are called prophets that's not gift of prophets that's not activists that can see a vision that's not that this prophet here is a different man brother brown said you get one to a generation in activist day there might have been a hundred prophets a thousand prophets that had thus said the lord and they came to pass but not one of them could write a book and say follow me they weren't given the vision for that age they had a part to play but the vision wasn't theirs but they had to be willing to line up to god's vision and the activists god said go to paul and baptize back and say i don't want to do it this man is killing people he said you're going to have to line up with the vision because this man is going to be the messenger that i'm sending to a gentile pride or you follow me now watch what how do we get these mysteries how do we find out what god was thinking before the foundation of the world now i know listen now i know most of you at least know exactly what i'm talking about so don't think i'm preaching this elementary for that reason i want to make sure i land the foundation tight enough then when i get to my point you understand where i'm coming from you see what i'm saying i want to make sure the foundation is tight enough where if you hear this for the first time you say brother holloway i see where you coming from or you follow me listen amos 3 7 surely the lord god will do nothing but revealeth his secrets unto who his servants the prophets so this mystery mind that god had before the foundation of the world where he was writing books where god was seeing visions where god could look down through time and see what's happened all these things will happen in the mind of god god said but the only ones that i'm going to reveal these mysteries too we'll be prophets so brother holloway is going to find his name and know what i call them too it's going to take a prophet to catch my mind bring that word preach that word as an open vision that holloway could see the vision and choose to walk in it because without a vision listen the people perish you will never wander into this you'll never stumble into it you'll never add paul said in ephesians chapter three it's the unsearchable riches of christ without a prophet without you see you will never see it there's a bride about to take around listen there's a bride about to take a rapture she's not going to stumble into it she's not going to wander into it she's gonna walk wise wide open into it why is it because she had someone to come with a message to tell her i'm announcing a coming the coming of the lord is at hand this is the generation and he brought god's vision how to dress that bride to make sure she don't miss it and she's going to walk into it perfectly dressed up all white singing armored christian soldier marching or why she sees it and she's following the voice of god not the man she's following the message that came out of the man i never shook his head i never broke bread with him but i believe what he preached was thus saying the lord and it's been ordering my steps ever since are you following me because the wrestling with that is to wrestle with god aaron and marian didn't have that revelation moses was too close to him brother that was his brother aaron was his brother mary was his brother or sister they saw brother moses and moses preached don't marry gentiles hebrews marry hebrews and what do moses go do sound like a hypocrite don't it he telling me don't marry gentiles and then you go get this ethiopian a black woman sounds hypocritical don't it and they thought they had listen they thought they had the right to question his integrity all it did was remember one to another well aaron you know your brother your brother he he ain't sticking with his own message well mary you know i i don't know why he did it look wrong to me too i think you're wrong and why they get murmured and presented this thing to moses moses we ain't sure you're doing right the bible said god heard it god heard it and god came down and when he came down he called the bible said he called a three to him and when all three approached moses aaron and miriam he told moses standing here and he took a step back further he said i remember y'all come here what he was about to rebuke them why they didn't recognize the voice of god in a man to question what he was preaching wasn't the question the man to question what he was preaching was questioning the one that told him to preach it you see how these questions have gotten so many people confused they're questioning things that their mind human mind cannot and is not capable of understanding it goes in a realm of the eternal thoughts of god and god said my thoughts are not your thoughts and my way is not your way you'll never fully understand my thinking but what you can't understand is what i called you to do in the age in which you're living aaron wants to be a priest be a priest don't question the prophet marian wants to play the tambourine and sing songs and lead the sister mary and do that don't question the message or you follow me every one of us got a calling abide in your calling and fulfill the will of god but when you try to go into a prophet's mind now we're getting out of step we don't question his mind but his gift can question your mind that's his vindication like that time when god came down and talked to abraham and mary and and was his wife named sarah was in the tent what was she doing questioning god in a tabernacle afresh and he can question her heart why did you think such a thing or why did you say such a thing and she could truthfully say in her lips i never spoken utterance he said but i can question your heart because i know what you're thinking it was the vindication that god was present or you follow me and so when god came down in my age what did he want to do with that gift he wanted to use that gift just to vindicate i'm present if in case you don't recognize it this message is not a message of a man he might have his faults but follow the message and i'm going to show you in a minute while i'm going this way father why why follow the message because the message wasn't the man the message was thus said of the lord it was god and god was there to vindicate his presence to the people now i want you to watch this why am i going this way i want you to watch this jeremiah chapter one these men were four ordained to their position jeremiah 1 4 says then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou came forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and ordained thee of prophet to the nations god needed a voice in that generation to say thus said the lord and he built the man before he was ever born he put the gift in him to fulfill that part of the word or you follow me every prophet comes the same way with the vision to the generation jeremiah wasn't just to the jews god said you're a different prophet jeremiah i'm ordaining you to the nations you're going to preach the uh uh all kind of all kind of kings not just the jews now i want you to watch this paul had the same calling i'm skipped there for time's sake these men not only have a gift of a prophet but the word comes to them because of that gift and the word anoints them in a certain way and the word that anoints them manifests the god-given sign of the son of man but the sign is only listen now to attract attention i'm not sticking with the message because brother brown deserves some woman's heart in chicago that caught my attention when i saw a deep caller deep and i saw this little man on the platform doing this and that and that and i'm like is this real and then people begin to give testimonies oh yeah i was in the service i heard so so-and-so had a chance to sit down and talk brother brother face to face tip it brother biscuit i asked questions about the message this and that and that had a chance to meet people that were there but that's not what kept me that caught my attention what's keeping me was when i heard what the what he preached i began to see something in the scripture that made the bible a new book it was no longer just do's and don'ts sisters you dressed this way brothers you conduct yourself that way the bible was elevated to a different kind of book i began to see god's thoughts listen god's mind for this generation unfolding on the pages of the book i can now take governments and place them in the bible i can now take the generation and place them in the bible i can now take movements like people rights and human rights and place some things i can now begin to see the world i live in in a different way why the bible is a new book i see myself and the world that i'm living in why i see it through the eyes of a vindicated prophet and so while some are arguing whether it was 16 men or 14 men or i don't care about that that was just a sign but now i'm hooked to the voice that followed the sign or wicked in the dungeon generation sticking out to the side i'm not seeking aside i'm seeking the voice that followed the sign now why is this so important let me jump to the parachute why is it so important this man these men they're ordained with a message for their generation and that message begins to place things it places modern events made clear by prophecy god knew the end from beginning and he could tell to the detail the day jesus christ would be crucified if he could deal to the detail the day the pentecost would happen if he could tell down to the time john the baptist would step on the scene and preach his first sermon if god could know that for that generation i'ma ask you a question can he know the same for your generation does he know what's going to happen month by month day by day year by year week does he know what's going to happen well if he can write those details in the bible for that generation can he do the same listen for your generation can your generation can your day and this message be just as clearly identified by the bible and your place in that message be just as clearly identified by the bible so your faith is not on flesh but your faith is on a message that reveals to you your generation your age its message and your place in it now watch this let me give you jump to the punch line this leadership is not a man this leadership is a prophet and the people here is prophet's message and they begin to say amen it's like a brother said something began to speak to him and he began to yield to it following simply means yielding when brother simmons might have said i want a church i don't know how many people please see you're not at maximum capacity when he's going to the pews this room could be more appeals if he wants to but he put them out he thought he needed for that time but let's say brother simmons would have said i'm building a church that'll seat i'm going to say 300. somebody else might have said brother simmons don't you want to go with 400 because god gonna bless your ministry you're gonna need more seats then somebody might say well brother simmons we ain't got but 150. don't we need a smaller church 150. see you got confusion but somebody's got to have a vision to say this is the exact number we're going to use and then listen and everybody else to follow that vision has to drop their ideas and say 300 is it i thought 500 i thought 150 but when he said 300 that's settled it why because god ordained him with the papers to carry the vision forward now all he needed was somebody to get behind him to make sure the vision comes to pass now i want you to watch this i want you to notice this the vision for this age was given only i want you to watch this for the elected it wasn't for everybody watch what paul says paul says in the book of second timothy chapter 2 wherefore i suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds listen but watch what he's saying but the word of god is not bound paul was not the key in terms of his flesh they could lock the man in prison and he could still write the word of god and send it out of prison why the word wasn't bound they wasn't following the flesh they was following a message listen therefore i undo all things listen for the elect's sake he wasn't sending a message to save the world christ said i'll come back and you shall see me but the world the cosmos shall not see me the message never comes for the world the message comes for the elect god said behold i send you elijah that was a specific group or you follow me you're that group now i want you to understand something the reason he sent elijah with a vision was the same reason paul came with a vision paul introduced a gentile bride turning from the jews to the gentiles our messenger reinstates the gentile bride in her proper position as god is now leaving the gentiles to go back to the jews or you follow me these prophets are needed because they're dispensational changes that are taking place but then that prophet begins to place everything by the word and this is what i want to get to in closing they don't just place the elect by the word they place that entire generation when moses preached he didn't just place israel in the promised land he plays pharaoh or you follow me he placed the magicians he began to place everything that was happening everything was being judged by moses message or you follow me when christ came he didn't just deal with peter james and john he dealt with judas he dealt with kyphosis his message began to reveal and place everything in his generation judas fulfilled the word just as much as peter did but the difference was peter revealed the word of the elect and went on to receive the holy ghost judas fulfilled the wrong scripture because he was blind to the word that was being made manifest in front of him or you follow me so while one fulfills scripture blindly he fulfills the wrong scripture peter by revelation goes to pentecost and fulfills the right scripture you see what i'm getting at so when this message begins to preach it begins to place that entire generation and their attitude toward his message begins to place them some are fulfilling the word blindly and some are doing it walking with their eyes wide open by revelation able fulfilled it with revelation can't fulfill the wrong scripture blindly moses fulfills it by revelation balaam does the wrong scripture blindly jeremiah does it by revelation hannah does the wrong scripture blindly and they're all acquainted with the word of god are you following me so what are you getting at brother holloway we're watching the headlines i'm closing we're watching the headlines what's happening bro siblings everybody what's putin doing what's putin doing well i go on the internet i pull it up let me see what the pundits are saying let me see what the reporters are saying let me see what they're saying over there in uh in the in the middle east let me see what they're saying on bbc let me see what they're saying on the religious stations let me see what all these people are saying everybody got their opinion what's putin doing you know putin was placed according to the word for this age the messenger said he never said to watch communism he never said watch the soviet union he said watch russia he said when russia gets into that position america is going to strike a war with her you know this whole military this thing happened right now it ain't just about ukraine if you listen to putin's own interviews that they've been given a man he said it's about the united states getting involved in world business that's affecting his country and the man is right about what he's saying our government is one of the most meddling governments in the world all of them are russia's meddling china's meddling they all are mailing none of them are being honest forgive me for saying that about my own country but the bible said when christ was carried upon a mountain he said and satan showed them all the kingdoms of the world satan said they all belong to me christ never denied that but the bible said in revelation when he comes back as king of kings he's going to bring down all nations all but america y'all good people over here oh what america it's as corrupt as any of them are you following me so our prophet placed this nation by his message he began to place russia by the message he said that this country was going to come to a spot that by giving the woman a right to vote they're going to elect the wrong man listen and in doing so there's going to be a lady that's going to rise to power either be president or vice president he gave seven visions that everyone he gave before they ever came to pass he said watch over germany they're going to raise up a dictator when he prophesied that you know hitler was just a chancellor he was a man that was appointed to an office he wasn't even elected he just a man appointed to another he's a chancellor brother branham said that man is going to be a german he's going to be out of australia he's going to be a dictator he's going to lead the world to the next world war and it happened exactly like that man said it was going to happen what was god showing you've got the voice of god in your generation how could a man see something like that before it ever happens hitler was a nobody but then after that prophecy went forth only a couple years later he became a somebody and then eight year four years no six years after that then he became the head of germany and led them into world war ii just exactly according to the state of the lord there were seven visions five of them had come to pass before that prophet died he said there's two more left he said one arm is the catholic church is going to take over this nation he said you're going to elect another catholic president probably and she's going to take up this nation you know joe biden's catholic he controls the executive branch you know the chief justice but the supreme court is catholic and if not mistaken i think there's six or seven catholics on the supreme court they control our bench the head of the house representative the largest legislative body in america is run by nancy pelosi a woman who's also catholic they now control our three main branches superior branches of government according to thus said the lord the day joe biden got inaugurated who did he have by his side brother branham gave a sign of what was going to be a sign when this woman rises to power he says she'll be elected president or vice president and she'll be a beautiful woman and she'll be wearing a purple dress how many realize that go look the internet up kamala harris does not wear dresses you see that woman in any kind of public position she's in a path of pants brother i said what does that mean that means she's left the headship of man and she's out of her position that's what that garment represents and that's what she wears but watch this woman what does she wear when she gets inaugurated the prophet didn't say she having a purple pantsuit the prophecy said she'll have on a purple dress and what did she put on for inauguration she couldn't help but put that outfit on she couldn't help but put a purple dress because she had to fulfill prophecy but she went into it blind she didn't know what she was fulfilling but i want you to watch this why am i saying this if you go look at the internet i'm not advising anybody to do that i'm just saying that because sometimes i got to go there to get information you go to the internet i get a lot of information on internet you go to internet see this information there's now religious people are rising up that are saying this this man had six visions and they can go back through history and count them they all came to pass and this most recent one 60 something years after his death now coming to pass you've got nominal believers out there now saying this man must be a prophet and when the world starts to look toward the word you know you're at the end number six happened over a year and a half ago and in between number six and seven you know what's supposed to take place the bride goes home well what was number seven there's going to be a man rise up in russia that america is going to strike a war and that man is going to respond with nuclear destruction not with fire bombs not with ten bombs but enough to when that prophet said he saw the vision of america he said she was covered with craters coast to coast by nuclear destruction now what are the pundits saying about putin he's acting like a madman he's not acting like a man with sins what he's doing is unreasonable and why weren't he talking about it why were he listening about it why why wouldn't pharaoh listen to anybody god raised him up why would nebuchadnezzar not listen to anybody god raised him up and that prophet said god is going to raise up russia to judge this generation for rejecting the word of god and his nation is going to be chief in that destruction putin is not doing what putin is doing because he's calculating politics he's not doing what he's doing because he's trying to strategize how to build russia oh in his mind he may be thinking he's calculating politics in his mind he's thinking he's building russia but that ain't really his game really there's something else moving him the bible said god put in their heart to fulfill his will that the word of god may come to pass church get ready something's about to strike we watched every sign waved just right and now we're in between the last two one has happened and i don't have no day or hour i can't say to be one year two years ten years but i believe what we're witnessing church the musicians could come what we're witnessing is the closing of this prophecy what we're witnessing is that last prophecy about to come to pass and as putin is now starting to threat with nuclear bombs the reporter saying is surely he won't do it surely he won't do it one after another the ones in russia surely he won't do it the ones in europe surely nobody wants a nuclear war surely he won't do it you've got thus said the lord somebody in that country has been anointed to press that button and when he does it's over for this nation it's over for rome he's going to judge this nation for joining up with that harlot to try to destroy this world system and try to destroy russia are you following me they're going to be judged for their evil deeds and god had to raise up somebody to send down his judgment and brother branham said he ordained russia what are we watching i believe we're watching the last of the seven visions i don't want to be here to see it come to pass i i i believe it i don't bring him i don't need to see i don't need to see it i i don't need to see the bomb drop to say he was right he was right he was no i don't need to see that i want to be in the air before one bomb strikes and say he was right he was right he was right [Applause] i want to follow the vision i've been convinced my heart has been persuaded it's right i want to follow the vision the messenger is gone but this message is still coming to pass let's buy our heads dear heavenly father i want to give you thanks for your grace thank you for giving us eyes to see and here's the here lord i said some open things across this pulpit i didn't intend to be that forward when i came up here but i hadn't said anything that's not already out there on the internet this message has been sounded around the world around this nation the people know what it's about they know what we believe and god i'm on the acts of the night as your servant anoint us afresh may your holy spirit give us a new stirring may not give us a spirit of fear but a spirit of grace and of a sound mind to know you ordained us to see these things and then to act accordingly when noah saw the rain he didn't panic he just got in the yard when the deaf angel was coming the real believers in panic they just applied the blood lord all we need to do now is find our place there was a going in or coming out but your prophet told us now is the time to go up god help us set our hearts on things above help us wear this world as a loose garment help us to pray more earnestly lord that your spirit will lead us the true leader lord not the body of a man but the spirit of christ that spoke from the lips of the man may your spirit lead us lord and guide us in all truth let us find our place in the word for this hour while we give you thanks does any desire prayer tonight i invite you in the name of christ whatever your needs are as our brother testified earlier how god could take and deliver a man from alcohol in one night cigarettes in one night if he could do that he can deliver us from anything that we have in need of tonight presented as our prayer i just want to open it up right now christ's name god bless you [Applause] [Music] we were saying down in mullins all the types and all the shatters and they're saying these visions that the prophet saw the seventh and so what would happen to america somebody over in ukraine they said when russia was mounting up around about ukraine they were saying that they didn't believe it the russian would do certain such a thing so the people stayed they wouldn't believe that russia would invade i don't believe america believed i don't believe many christians and bride so-called believe that it could happen anytime the bombs can fall it was said so clear tonight get your house in order be certain of god you know paul had to give accountant he said i've had sean declared to you the whole cancer of god each and every pastor have to give an account if he has to give account for you most people don't say i'm kind for myself you know it's difficult for pastors to stand and say i got to give a count for you the prophet said paul be there with his people in his age and all the pastors that heard paul timothy titus and all of them have to give account with those that they preached to they'll stand with their people their congregations and god will go to paul and paul has to answer to god for what he preached got to go to timothy tempting tammy to have to answer before god but what do you preach each pastor don't have to answer to god for what he preached then he gonna go to those ones that heard them preach so did you hear what did you do with the gospel that you heard i heard them but god i you told me to do something different from what he's you see what i'm saying they tried to get the prophet to say if the angel god told you something he said if an angel come from heaven tell me something different from what this bible say he said i'll let him be a curse you know somebody tried to convince you to say something different than what the bible say then let him be a curse but if the bible said it you should believe it are you with me i want you to understand that that's going to be account you have to give a count i gotta give a count so sometimes when we're telling you and preaching to you it's because we know one day i'm gonna have to give a count that's why i don't want nobody blood on my hand no matter how hard you take it and oh brother see me uh-uh
