Uh when I saw him yesterday, you know, he came to the hall while a brother was preaching, brother Zar Brooks with his shirt folded and I said, "Wow, this is a veteran. He's a soldier." You see, you know, a veteran against the enemies of your soul, a fighter against the enemy of your marriage, a fighter against the enemy of your salvation, a fighter against the enemy of your progress. And uh appreciate him for uh calling us together tonight, you know, from uh since yesterday. And I'm grateful to the almighty God that, you know, I'm able to be here.

And God has these signs shall follow them that believe &gt;&gt; in my name. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; And God has used her and a lot of testimonies in India and Africa and different places and down in Florida. A lot of miracles and signs and wonders. I said just share a little bit of the testimonies how God has blessed her. Not to be a preacher, but just to be a believer. &gt;&gt; Sisters could be inspired. You can be believers &gt;&gt; and God can bless you for just being the believer. Sister Hannah Mirage, come. [Applause] [Music] God bless you all. I'm so happy to be in the house of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; I give God all the glory. &gt;&gt; He deserve all the praise. &gt;&gt; He's the God of miracles. &gt;&gt; All my life, I've seen the supernatural. As a little kid growing up in this message, and I thank the Lord. I have thousands of testimony, church. I can write volumes and volumes what I've seen my God do &gt;&gt; because he's real. &gt;&gt; Take him off the Bible. That's what I saw. I'll just share a few. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We had a trip to go to India and we didn't know we needed a visa to go to India. So when we went to the airport, it's a long testimony, but I'll be very short. When we went to the airport, the lady said, "You all need a visa to go to India." We said, "No." She said, "Yes, you all." So, they booked another flight for us to go to Dubai. So, we went there and we we had to go to the Indian consulate over there. They said it will take 4 days to get the visa, 48 hours actually. And that was Thursday. We needed to fly out on Friday. Me and my husband, we got together and we prayed because the services were Saturday. Friday, Saturday. and we had to have connecting flights and the people said, "No, you know where you can get this visa because it it you would have to wait until Monday." We put it in the hand of the Lord. We prayed and we went to bed. The next morning, the visa appeared on my husband's phone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. We boo our we we went downstairs. We printed a visa. We reached to India. I'm here and they pull me aside. My husband is there. We weren't together. And the immigration officer is watching at the visa. He searched his entire system. They have no visa. They didn't he said we didn't issue this visa. How did you get this visa? Then they questioning my husband in the other side. This they call all the immigration officers around us, you know, like we were some we came there illegal. But we know Jesus sent us there. &gt;&gt; So they went inside and they they called the head of the immigration and this the guy said, "Ma'am, where did you get?" I said, "You all issued this." He said, "No, it's not in our system. We didn't give you this." So when they called the head of the immigration, he said, "This is our stamp, but it's not in the system." He said, "Just let them go and we were free. Jesus gave us the visa." [Applause] What a mighty God we serve. And it was just miracles upon miracles upon miracles. When the brother saw it said, "You all came through." I said, "Jesus brought us through." &gt;&gt; Then another testimony while we in Africa while I was walking out the church, my husband was praying for the sick and I was just there. We're walking. We had a lots and lots and lots of testimonies. And this young girl, she laid on the floor. Her whole leg was broken. Apparently, a truck crushed her leg. And the doctors tried to put the bones together, but there's no way they could put the bones together. She was in so much pain and she was in a crutch. And they said, "Sister Hannah, can you pray for her?" &gt;&gt; Church, I stand here and I tell you nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; I went to my knees and I started to cry out to the Lord. I said, "Lord, you created these bones. The doctors cannot find the pieces together because there's splinters all over her legs and she's in such pain. She can't bear the pain anymore." And there was cuts all over. They tried to put it together, but there's no way they could have done it. I said, "God, you still the God that create can create a bone." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, she's like my little daughter's kneel. I'm kneeling here and I'm asking you just to put the bones back together. Father, &gt;&gt; I know I've seen you done it already and I know you're going to do it again. &gt;&gt; A few months after we came back and the pastor over there called me. He said, "Sister Hannah, the doctor called her." Something that they never ever would do in Africa because that would happened two years ago. The accident was about two years ago. And a few weeks after I prayed, they said, "We want to smile. we want to see this child. So they call her in the hospital and they saw all the bones are perfect in her leg. Every piece of bone was put back together [Music] and she was walking and leaping and praising God because Jesus put the bones back together. That's the God I serve. He is mighty in battle. And the pastor called me. He said, "Sister Hannah, I want to tell you something." He said, "Every bone is perfect in her body, &gt;&gt; and she's walking and praising the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A sister flew from Boston to my house &gt;&gt; a few days ago and she said, "Sister Hannah, I have a problem in my Well, she didn't tell me what it was. She said, "It's hepatitis B." She said, "My liver is damaged." And I put my hand on her body. I said, "Father, you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever." &gt;&gt; She called me yesterday. She said, "I'm perfect. My liver is perfect." &gt;&gt; She said, "I don't have any more problems." She had two tumors on her on her thyroid that she was due for surgery and she couldn't swallow. But she had the problem with her liver for 22 years. She said, she said she couldn't eat any and anything, but she said she's so perfect. So she sent me a prayer cloth before she came to Florida because she couldn't travel. And I didn't know what it was for. And she said when she got the clo church, I'm nobody, okay? &gt;&gt; I'm just a sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; And I love the Lord with all my heart. when you see me praising my Jesus, I have a reason why. &gt;&gt; He's been so good to me. She said, I just took the cloth in the envelope and I just put it on my neck and I was perfectly whole. The tumors disappeared from her neck. [Applause] She heard the testimony about the visa and she has she wanted her green card &gt;&gt; for 17 years. She said she called me. She said, "Can you pray for me?" Because she heard so many testimonies about green cards and there was another incident. A sister was stuck in Haiti and the brother called me. She said, "Can you pray for me?" I said, "Lord, I don't know where Haiti is. They closed the airport, but I'm pointing to some direction. Open the airport for that sister to come out. Church, the next day, the government opened the airport. The sister flew out and then they closed the airport back. What a mighty God. &gt;&gt; And this sister heard about these testimonies and she wanted her green card. My God, &gt;&gt; Jesus. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And she called me. She said, "My daughter is going to France and I have to go to get my She said, "If they call me for an interview," I said, "Sister, they're not going to call you for an interview, but it's mandatory with this new government, you have to have an interview and fingerprint before you get your green card." And while you're going through the process, most of the time they arrest you. And she said, "The the police are breaking the people's houses and just arresting them in the neighborhood. She's seen it." And she was so scared. She said, "Can you pray?" I said, "Sure." I said, "Do you believe?" She said, "Yes, I believe." &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord Jesus." That was a Thursday. Now, she wanted this green card 17 years. That's just recently, a couple weeks ago. She said, I said, "Lord, let your will be done." She's not going to get no interview and she's going to get that green card. &gt;&gt; Church, that was Thursday. Sunday, the immigration stamped her green card. Now, they don't work on Sundays, okay? But Jesus speed it up. &gt;&gt; 3 days time she had her green card. Three days time the impossible became possible. [Applause] She said, she showed me the card. She said, "The attorney said, "I don't know what happened. This does not happen because you're supposed to go for an interview and you're supposed to get your fingerprint, but they p bypass everything and they mailed you your green card because Jesus was there and working on her behalf." &gt;&gt; I just thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; I've seen cancer disappeared. When doctors gave them up, cancer just disappeared. I see God created kidneys. The foot just stretched out. You name it. I can tell you God still creates. &gt;&gt; I'll stop with this one. &gt;&gt; I was in need of a piece of fabric because I do interior decorating. &gt;&gt; And my worker was with me standing next to me and I was short of a I think a yard and 3 in or so. She said, "Mama." She calls me mama. She said, "What you going to do?" because the job was due in the morning and there's no nobody has this fabric. It was the last of the fabric I bought. I said I know someone who can create [Music] &gt;&gt; I've seen him created before before my eyes. I've seen him created stuff. &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, you know what I need." I didn't pray church. I said, "Lord, you know what I need." And we saw the fabric stretched in front of our eyes. &gt;&gt; Literally stretched in front of our eyes. to the exact amount of inches that we needed. And she started shaking like a leaf. She said, "Mama, God is real." &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes, he is real. My God is real." Another another incident. This is my last one. Forgive me. Another incident. Some believers came in the shop and they asked for prayer. They were just coming in. People were just coming in for prayer &gt;&gt; and the presence of the Lord just filled my place &gt;&gt; and I needed a vase. I had gone to Miami and I forgot to buy the vase, a specific vase and she said, "Mom, you forgot to buy the vase." I say, "Yes, honey. I forgot to buy the vase." I said, "But the Lord knows." And after I prayed for the sister and she was totally healed, that little voice say, "Didn't you say you wanted a vase?" &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes, Lord, I needed a vase. I needed so bad." &gt;&gt; And Esther was right there. There was no face there. And out of thin air, a vase appeared in front of our eyes. He's the same God that created squirrels. He can give you anything you need. &gt;&gt; These eyes have seen that. &gt;&gt; These eyes have seen the miraculous. &gt;&gt; All I said, "Father, you know what I need." &gt;&gt; And there came the vase in front of my eyes. &gt;&gt; I'm so humbled to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; I give God all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory. He deserve it. &gt;&gt; I love the Lord with all my heart. God bless you all. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you hear things like that. You said, "Let me check up and see." I said, "Okay, let's check. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "Pastor Simmons, we've been knowing one another for a long time." &gt;&gt; It's real. &gt;&gt; I said it's real. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; All things are possible &gt;&gt; to them that believe. &gt;&gt; I trust that you believe tonight. Trust that you want something from God, &gt;&gt; Lord, that the impossible is possible.

The book of St. John the 4th chapter. I want to begin reading at the first verse. When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples, he he left Judea and departed again into Galilee. And he met and he must need go through Samaria. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sincar, near to the plot or the portion of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there. And Jesus therefore being weary with his journey, sat by the by the wall or by the well, and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said unto her, "Give me to drink." Father God, we thank you tonight for your love. We thank you, oh God, for being in this presence, oh Lord. Father God, we know, Lord God, uh Lord, what heaven is going to be like, Father, we're here, Lord. We're getting a glimpse, oh Lord, of how it would be, oh God.

And I want to remind you the word that we just read now that that John begin to tell us. He said, "When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples, he left you there and departed to Galilee, and he that he must go through Samaria." You know, when when when when when when God has you on his radar, there is nothing that can stop him from coming to you. Now, we know that to get to where he was going, amen, this terrain, amen, uh, wasn't an easy terrain. Amen. Where he had to go, Amen. Uh, Amen. to get to that little city uh in Samaria. Amen. Amen. But there was something there waiting for him. Amen. Amen. Something that that that had a need that he had to go by. Amen. Uh, so this morning, I'm so thankful that he that he saw my heart. Amen. Uh, he saw that there was a need to come by and visit me. Amen. Uh, and I said, "Lord, uh, just have your way tonight, oh God." Uh, cuz I believe there's somebody here needs him to come by and visit tonight. Amen. Uh, you know, there's a word that tells me say, "I stand at the door and knock." Amen. Uh, and if any man will open the door, he'll come in and stop. Amen. Uh, you know, but now we, you know, as as humans, you know, Americans or whatever, you know, you know, when someone knock on the door, we always say, uh, you know, who is it? Amen. You know, and and then when there's another question come, what you want? Amen. Uh you know, uh but here come one standing at the door. Amen. Uh that is able to answer every need. Amen.

Amen. uh you know you know you know once you come to the place amen uh that when you are identified with Christ uh you know the devil don't like you amen uh the devil hates you amen uh when you've been identified with Christ uh the devil hates you amen even Paul say uh you know uh you know I am uh what crucified with Christ amen uh nevertheless I live amen but not I amen because the life I not live through the flesh I live it through him amen and the devil don't like that.

Or matters. Amen. Uh now if I have identified you in that scripture, the altar is open right now. &gt;&gt; If you have been identified in that scripture, amen. Uh the altar is open right now. Amen. Uh but I say God, I'm so thankful, Lord God, uh that you know the plans you have for my life, Lord. Uh and they are not of evil, but of good uh to bring me to that expected end where you want me to be. Amen. Uh but notice now, so Paul, he said, he said, "Yet if any man suffer as a Christian," how many thank God you're a Christian? &gt;&gt; And if you're not, we hope that something will be said before we leave tonight that we want to make you want to be a Christian.

Uh the Bible tells me, amen. uh that all of my righteousness uh all of my trying to be like a Christian uh and act like God uh amen is nothing but filth to rise uh if it's not in the right place uh but when I turn it to the Lord amen and let him take control uh then it's glorified in God. Amen. So I said Lord uh I don't want to make anything of myself. Amen. You know the sheep don't make anything of himself. He just eat sheep food &gt;&gt; and the wool come automatically.

So I say Lord we are so thankful amen that we come to the place to know uh that is not that we have done but what he has done amen he himself amen who predestinated us from the foundation of the world amen uh and I like to say it like this amen uh amen uh before the foundation of the world amend came along and he slipped a rang of predestination on my finger amen oh my you know you know sometimes amen uh you know uh you know bar men amen And uh they'll go along uh you know one time my wife had just size that I couldn't get it off and it start cut through so I had it resized so I can get it off now but I don't take it off. I don't take it off but but sometime you know they get the place they take it and put it in their pocket. [Music] &gt;&gt; But God knows those that are his &gt;&gt; you can hide it all you want to &gt;&gt; but God knows that you are his. Amen. My grandmother do have a song. She say uh sinner you can't hide. God know where you live. Amen. Uh sinner you can't hide. Amen. Uh so you can try to move everything you want. But what God knows here is that those that are his. Amen. But that ring of predestination. Amen. Uh is to let the devil know that you have already been taken. &gt;&gt; You've already been taken. Amen. Uh so when I'm walking Amen. Uh and and some lady trying to cut her eyes at me. Uh you know, I just go [Music] &gt;&gt; and she knows I'm already taken. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the devil comes your way, Amen. Uh you lift up your ring of predestination uh and let him know that you come from God and you're going back to God. Uh amen. And you're not going to let the devil stop you uh on your way. cuz God has made a way for us. Amen. Uh so I say thank God it is our way. Amen. Thank him for what he's doing in this last hour. Amen. Uh so we find so all of these things. Amen. Amen. Going to work for us. Amen. So all you go through these things are amen. They're pushing them. Amen. They're they're building. Amen. Uh they're molding you to be be what you were a man. Born to be. Amen. Uh but God created in his mind for you to be. Amen. Uh even Paul comes along uh and tell us this in Romans 8:28. Uh he and we know that all things work together for good. &gt;&gt; Not that everything going to be good. Amen. Uh but it's working for my good. Amen. Uh he said all things work together for good. Uh to them that love God. How many love the Lord? Amen. Uh so whatever you are going through, Amen. Uh it's working for your good. Amen. Uh don't complain. Uh lift up your hands and say thank you Lord. Uh hallelujah. Anyhow, Lord. I'm going through. But God I know on the other side of through Lord there are you Lord God. Amen. Amen. Don't let anything stop you. Amen. Sometime we get into problems. Amen. And we get all all Amen. are withdrawn. Amen. Uh but remember on the other side of through Amen. That's where you got your blessing. Amen. So don't stop. Amen. Uh so he goes on say now them and to them who are the called. &gt;&gt; How many believe you are the call? &gt;&gt; Oh my hold on to that. Amen. Amen. Uh according to his purpose. Amen. For whom he did forno, he did also predestinate uh to be conformed. Amen. To the image. Amen. Of his son. Amen. Uh you know, so now he's working with our destiny. Amen. Amen. Where we going to be? Amen. Uh cuz you know, see it's God's will that none should perish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when it come to this, amen. Uh he reach all the back into his fornowledge. Amen. And he sees that you going to do it. Amen. uh you going to obey uh you're going to be with him. Amen. So God reached back in his fornowledge and then he can bring forth a predestination. Uh and with that he said I'm calling you now. Amen. I say thank God in this way. Amen. So Paul goes on say now and for them also that for more whom he predestinate them also he called and whom he called them he also justified. &gt;&gt; And whom he justified them he also glorified. Oh my I can walk on now. Amen. uh in that that tells it all. Amen. Uh that tells it all. Amen. Uh as a redemption story, it tells it all. Amen. Uh amen. He saw me. Amen. Uh he call me redeem. Amen. Uh and not only that, he justified me. Amen. So whatever happened, God brought me back to the place uh as though it never happened in the first place. Amen. So I go back to the first place. Amen.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my what God is doing for us in this last hour. So we fine now. So uh so what shall we say to these things? &gt;&gt; What shall we say to these things? &gt;&gt; Oh my. When the devil come and say you're not going to make it, uh what shall we say to these things? Amen. He has already been proclaimed. Amen. of what God said in his word. Amen. Uh he's already predestined me. He's already called me. He's already justified me and I'm already glorified in this body. Amen. My glorified body is already on the inside. Amen. Oh my. &gt;&gt; So I say, Lord, help in this hour. Amen. Uh so what shall we say to these things when the enemy comes your way? Amen. And trying to get you down. Amen. Uh what shall we say to these things? Well, I tell you, amen. I If God be before us, &gt;&gt; who shall be against us? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the devil bring every weapon he wants. But there's no weapon formed against me. Amen. Uh that shall prosper. It cannot stand because God have already predestinated me. He's already called me. He's already justified me. And I'm going home to glory. Amen. I say, "Thank God in this last day." Amen. So I don't have to worry about it. Amen. God has already done it. Amen. I couldn't do it, but God did. Amen. &gt;&gt; God did. Amen. Oh my. So I said, Lord, help us now. And we tell us now, he who spareth not &gt;&gt; his own son. Come on. &gt;&gt; But deliver to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; This a little bitty stuff. Amen. &gt;&gt; But my Bible tells me he delivered for us all. Amen. And he But how could he spare not his own son, but deliver up him for us all? How shall he not with him also freely give us all things. Amen. All things. Amen. So you let the devil know that you are possessor of all things. Amen. There nothing, Amen. God will withhold from us. Amen. Uh why I give you all things. Amen. Uh, ask and you shall have. Amen. Ask, you shall receive. Amen. I will withdraw all no good things from you. Amen. Uh, God will give us all things. Amen.

Uh now, it's a it's a it's not an unnatural thing to have thirst. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we don't look at it in the physical. Amen. you get thirsty and you you drink water. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, other things. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know when I was working in the school system and having my CDLs, I was over at the buses at one time. So, I got my bus license CDLs and when you're in that pool, you have to take a drug test saying they just randomly pick you. Randomly pick you. So um so I got chosen had to go to the place take my little papers and they go in give him a sample everything I come back out they he looked at me said you know you can't drink water don't you said yeah he said yeah you need to drink some water because while it happened at that time I was drinking sodas sodas saying you know trying to quench that thirst just drink it. Amen. You know, and you know what? And I'm drinking it and not knowing that it was bringing detrimental to me. &gt;&gt; Even though it was trying to satisfy that thirst. Amen. Uh but yet it was being a detrimental to me. Amen. Uh into the place that God told me, uh you need to drink more water. Amen. Uh and I say, Lord, let me come to the place, Lord Lord. Not just with that physical thirst, uh but with my spiritual thirst, Lord God. Uh don't let me uh take in things oh God uh that's trying to cover that thirst uh that's bring a detrimental to my soul oh God uh God let me reach out to you. Amen. Uh amen. We won't David said amen. Uh but we find now so uh so in this fourth chapter now in this fourth chapter of John. Amen. Amen. We find that uh here come John begin to tell us amen. Uh you know about this little woman at Samir with with her thirst. Amen. You know, and uh Jesus at this time, amen, uh is showing grace and mercy to her. Amen. Cuz this woman uh she uh you know, here she was uh she was looking for something. Amen. &gt;&gt; She was looking for something. Amen. Uh you know, and uh you know, in in other words, uh amen. Uh she was thirsting for something. Amen. You know, and we think about this little woman uh and it seemed like her life was all messed up. &gt;&gt; See like a life of all messed up. Amen. You know, but you know, that's like some of us. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; But I'm reminded the Bible say a broken spirit and a contrite heart, God cannot deny. Amen. So no matter how messed up you are. How messed up you think you are. Amen. Uh you reach out to God. Amen. Uh and with that broken heart uh and contract spirit. Amen. Uh God cannot deny. Amen. Uh why he'll come to you. Amen. Uh if God sailed the sea, Amen. Uh over to the little land. Amen. Uh amen. Uh where there was one man standing there. Amen. uh and why and had a and a host of demons in him. Amen. But Jesus came over. Amen. And what was it? Uh Amen. He had a need and Jesus came to fulfill that need. Amen. So I believe God will do it for us. Amen. Uh just reach out to him. Amen. But we find out so anytime we begin to think about amen what God would do. Amen. Amen. He's doing it for us on our behalf. Amen. So we find out so in this now so this little woman now that that that you know this little woman Amen. Amen. that that that that seemed like she was life was all messed up. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Jesus say it was needful or had need to go by the way of Samaria. &gt;&gt; Because in that little woman was something resting. Amen. Uh that is called Amen. representation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and Jesus couldn't pass that by. Amen. Uh cuz according to Ephesians 1, Amen. Uh and uh and the Bible tell us, Amen. Uh that according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. Amen. Uh now so this little woman uh she was already chosen in him uh before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And there was something that were placed down in there called representation. And uh and all no matter how messed up she was, Amen. Uh it was still resting there. Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't tell me that God uh can't do anything. Uh God can do anything but fail. Amen. Uh no matter how bad the situation is. Uh no matter where you are. Amen. Uh God can meet you right there. Amen. Uh and he'll bring her to where he is. Amen. So this little woman, Amen. that was there with representation. Amen. That she had from the foundation of the world. Amen. Uh amen. In other words, she was heir to a promise. Amen. That God had. Amen. Uh and and here here she is now. And here she is now. Amen. Something in her. Amen. that begin to thirst. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh now, and this was something that would deepen her begin to ye begin to yearn for something. Amen. Uh and uh and she's trying to amen satisfied with things of the outside. Amen. Uh you know, uh well, you know, uh I know there's something missing. Amen. Uh and my father's told us uh that we should come here. Amen. Uh cuz in these mountains, we going to worship. Amen. Uh we going to do this. Jesus said, "Woman, you don't know what you're going to worship." Amen. Oh my. And what? So he begin to deal with her and begin to try to draw her away from the physical &gt;&gt; to the spiritual &gt;&gt; and begin to deal with amen her innermost being &gt;&gt; cuz on the outside surely she was messed up. &gt;&gt; She couldn't go to the well with other women. She had to go at the late evening time when she was there by herself because of her situation. Amen. Uh but that didn't matter to God. &gt;&gt; Your situation doesn't matter to God cuz he's a fix of everything. Amen. Uh oh my. The Bible tells me, amen. Uh that that God is able to do all things. Uh and I said, "Lord, here I stand, Lord. Uh God, I was in a mess, but God, you came down. &gt;&gt; You Lord, rescue me." Amen. &gt;&gt; So this little woman out, she had her thirst. Amen. And he come to satisfy that thirst. Amen. &gt;&gt; There she was looking for the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Might didn't know how quite to do it. Amen. But there was something in there that's etching. Amen. You know, it's like a little baby. Amen. Uh you don't you don't teach it. Amen. Uh the the drink. Amen. There's something on his side. That when that call comes, Amen. It's ready. Amen. It's ready. Amen. Uh you can even take your finger and and stick it in a little baby mouth, he start sucking. Amen. Cuz there's something on the inside tells him he needs to suck. Amen. He needs a drink. Amen. And I said, Lord, here we are standing in this last hour. We let the devil pull a wool over ussh knowing that there's a thirst in our heart. Amen. Uh there's a thirst in our soul uh that need to be satisfied. Uh and we let the devil pull a wool uh and try to give us out of things. Amen. Uh like he did me uh amen. Solders and all those things uh to cover up the real thirst. Amen. &gt;&gt; That I need my soul satisfied. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we find so this little woman I had this thirst. Amen. And there she was. Amen. Uh you know she she was thirsting. Amen. and and but she tried to satisfy it in in other ways you know from one husband to another one and we won't get into what the six and all those mean. We want to stick with a man satisfying uh amen the thirst of your spiritual thirst of your soul. Amen. So don't let the devil quench that godly thirst &gt;&gt; with anything of the world with anything that try to satisfy what God has placed in you uh to cry out after him. Amen. God put that in you. Amen. uh to cry out to him. Amen. Uh and the devil comes along uh and is trying to quench that. Amen. Uh and try to satisfy you with other things. Amen. But I'm here tonight. Amen. Uh to tell you, Amen. Uh you don't have to take the devil remedy. God got what you need. Uh come to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming up, there used to be a you know a tele evangel healer, Reverend Ike. And Reverend I had this little prayer prayer cloth &gt;&gt; and he said, "You know, you can't lose &gt;&gt; with the stuff I use." &gt;&gt; Well, my grandmother, sister grandmother Flora Leette, &gt;&gt; she say I'm going to write back to him and tell him that he can't lose with the stuff I use. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And I and I believe if there had to be a showdown, &gt;&gt; we'd have had another Elijah showdown that Reverend I could have called all he wanted what he had, it would have never answer. &gt;&gt; But my grandmother, Amen, who had a stroke, amen, and they say she weren't going to walk. Uh, but she say, "I'm going to walk again." Amen. Uh, and all grandmother got that place. Amen. She walked again. Amen. I said, "Lord, why?" Because the stuff she used, Amen. Amen. was able to bring a result. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I remember coming up. We used to had to, you know, uh put uh water on the radio. &gt;&gt; Get your water, put it on the radio. And we put the water on the radio and uh and had jugs and everything. Uh pull the radio, had weighed it down with all kind of water. We had it sitting around. We Oh, I'm hurting her. Drink some water. He want the water. It wasn't the water. &gt;&gt; It was the faith we had in it. &gt;&gt; It was the faith we had in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I say, why try all of those things up? &gt;&gt; Try Jesus. &gt;&gt; Look to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look to him. Amen. Uh who going to raise all of your midnights? Amen. Uh who can call back the sunlight. Amen. Uh amen. Bring you back to the place. Amen. Uh as though you never did it in the first place. Amen. That's God. Amen. through his justification. Amen. But we find now so uh so she tried to quench it in other ways. Amen. So certain Satan all he wants to do is pervert. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He wants to pervert &gt;&gt; the satisfying portion that God want us to have. Amen. So he tried to pervert. Amen. Uh the satisfying of your soul. Amen. Uh with something of the world, something that that's partial. Amen. But we are tired of partial realization. &gt;&gt; I want full realization in this hour. I don't want that anymore. So, David began to cry out, and this is my my cry when I'm talking about satisfying uh the spiritual thirst of my soul. David said in Psalms 42, uh, "As the heart painth after the water broke, &gt;&gt; so painth my soul after thee, oh God, &gt;&gt; then he went on and brought this in." Amen. Uh, my soul thirsteth for God, the living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When shall I come in and appear before my God? Amen. &gt;&gt; And we find out so when David was writing this. Amen. David was in a in a in a place of distress. &gt;&gt; David was in a place of distress. Amen. And you know sometime uh distress when it comes Amen. Uh it makes us a better person. Amen. Uh Amen. We can call the distress. Amen. Desperation. Amen. Uh and sometime desperation uh has to sink in. Amen. Uh before we get to moving for God. Amen. Uh it shouldn't be that way but that's how it has to be. Amen. So here come David. Amen. Uh in this despair place. Amen. So the last part begin to write. He say uh my tears have been my meat day and night. &gt;&gt; While they continually say unto me, where is thy God? &gt;&gt; Where is thy God? All this you speak of. Amen. When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me. For I had gone with the multitude. Uh I went with them to the house of God. with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude uh that kept holy day. &gt;&gt; I played church. I went sat on the pew. &gt;&gt; I listened up. But nothing was happening. Amen. Uh there was something that was still that was etching at my soul. Uh and though I went with the mother to but still I needed something else. Amen. &gt;&gt; I needed something else. Amen. Uh and David say, "Oh, why cast down oh my soul? And why art thou disqued in me? &gt;&gt; Hope in God, &gt;&gt; for I shall yet praise him uh for the help of his cultiness. &gt;&gt; So when so when God appears, when God come on the scene, Amen. Uh he'll take away that thirst. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's the soul satisfier. &gt;&gt; So I said, Lord, help us in this hour. Amen. So there was David, amen, meditating, David, uh amen, agonizing, David, uh in despair. David in desperation. Amen. Uh and begin to cry out, "Lord, where are you, Lord?" Uh I need that living God. Uh I don't want a historical God. Uh I want a living God. Amen. Uh don't tell me a tale. Uh give me the true God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what David wanted. Amen. He wanted something to satisfy &gt;&gt; that spiritual thirst. Amen. &gt;&gt; And David even later on knew how it was to be without that. David say, "Oh Lord, take not thy holy spirit away from me." &gt;&gt; He come to the place he say, "But restore." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Restore &gt;&gt; unto me the joy of thy salvation. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew how it was. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be without the true living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But here we see this woman in John 4. Amen. Amen. And this is where we must come to. Amen. When Jesus told her, amen, uh that the water that she was seeking, amen, she would thirst again. &gt;&gt; All that I might be doing out in the world, amen, uh it's not going to satisfy my soul. &gt;&gt; All that I you know, and you know, and this is not just for those that are, this is this is everybody. Amen. Uh even those that are in church, amen. Uh sometime we are not where we need to be. Amen. Uh we still have a longing in our soul uh that we need to see God. Amen. Uh &gt;&gt; so we find amen. So uh so so that whatever I'm using, Amen. Uh Amen. It's not going to last always &gt;&gt; until I get him the true living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we find Jesus said to her, "Whatsoever what whosoever drinketh of this water, the things that you using to cover up that thirst, amen, you're going to thirst again." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're going to get up tomorrow and still have that longing in your heart. &gt;&gt; You know, at one time I often wonder People go out, they drink, they smoke teacher, &gt;&gt; and then they get up next day hangover, &gt;&gt; head hurting. &gt;&gt; I'm like, why in the world you do it for? I say, let me tell you this. I can get high on &gt;&gt; I can get drunk &gt;&gt; and I don't even have a hangover. All I want is more. But you get yours. Amen. So you can't go the next day. Amen. Why? Because it doesn't satisfy. Amen. But when we get a hold of the real thing. Amen. Uh it bring us satisfaction to our soul. Amen. So this woman now, so here she is asking this question and Jesus said now and she said now unto her, if thou knowest the gift of God &gt;&gt; that thirst that you something that's longer. Amen. I reminded if there is in there something calling for more of God then there's more God out there for you. Amen. Uh don't settle for just the mediocre. Don't settle for a substitute. Amen. Uh get what's real. Amen. &gt;&gt; So say if you know the gift of God who it is that speaketh or sith to thee give me drink thou would have asked of him and he will give thee. Amen. Oh. He will give thee a living water. Not stagnated stuff, &gt;&gt; but living water. Amen. &gt;&gt; But whosoever drinkketh of the water that I give him uh sh and shall never thirst. Amen. I said, Lord, it's resolved now. Amen. That's the water I want. Lord God. Uh that's why Lord, that's the only satisfying portion. Uh Lord, get me in your word, oh Lord. Uh get me under the water spout of God. Uh let him pour his holy spirit on me. Amen. Uh you'll never thirst again. But the water that I shall give you shall be to him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. What a mighty God. Amen. So there you will draw the attention away from the the physical. Amen. To the spiritual. Amen. And and all the different the thirst of the natural, the thirst of the spiritual. Amen. You know the natural just going to try to satisfy the natural. Amen. Uh but I want something that's going to satisfy my soul. Amen. I want something that I won't thirst again. Amen. Uh, I want something, amen, that's real. Amen. Uh, amen. Uh, amen. Uh, when you open the pages of the book, Amen, of the Bible, amen, uh, I want something to come up off of the page, amen, uh, and live in my life, amen. Uh, just like Jesus, Amen. Uh, when he read, they hand him the scripture. Amen. And he opened the scroll, uh, and he read. Amen. Uh, amen. Behold, uh, the spirit of the Lord is upon me. Uh, he has anointed me, uh, to preach the gospel. Amen. And he went on talk about his journey. And he closed the book. Amen. and hand it back to the minister and say, "This day, Amen. This day, amen, this scripture is fulfilled in your ear." I say, "God, let that be fulfilled in my life. Amen. Uh, I don't want a partial. I don't want to make believe. Uh, I don't want to substitute. Uh, give me the real Lord. God, give me, Lord, uh, let it overflow, uh, let it be bubbling up, oh God, into everlasting life." Amen. Uh, that's what God want us. Amen. Uh, amen. Uh, and sometime you want, Amen. H when you see someone, Amen. Amen. are rejoicing and feeling good. Say, "What is wrong with them?" Amen. Uh they got that satisfying potion. Amen. They got that living water. Amen. Uh that's moving in them. Amen. Uh oh my mother-in-law, you saying. Amen. Cool weather well water springing up in me. Amen. Everlasting water springing up in me. Amen. Uh I got to have that water. Amen. &gt;&gt; Got to have that water. Amen. So we find us all these things. Amen. Amen. Something that's real. Amen. Something that's real. Amen. And after this woman was drawn away from the phys from the physical of what she thought she could do and when Jesus told her I'm he speaking and this woman come to the place she said the woman said here sir give me this water give me this water amen give me this water that I thirst not uh neither come uh hi there to drink amen or to draw amen uh and I say to you tonight amen uh if your soul uh if your soul uh is thirsty Amen. Uh, amen. Uh, ask of him. Amen. Uh, give me that water, Lord. Uh, that I don't thirst anymore, Lord. Uh, I'm tired of the clubs. Uh, I'm tired of the drinking. I'm tired of the smoking. I'm tired of the sin, Lord. I want to come to that living water. Amen. I want to come to that living water. Amen. Everything we're trying to satisfy and try to soo, amen, what's going on in our lives. Amen. But he's the only soul satisfying. He's the only one that can sooge you. Amen. Amen. So she got tired. Amen. Got tired, Amen. of the turmoil in her life. She wanted to lay it all down. Amen. So he said, "Give me that water." Amen. And woman come to the place where she was having her thirst. Amen. Satisfied. And the Bible tell me the woman then left her water pots. &gt;&gt; All the things that that dealt with the physical &gt;&gt; are trying to satisfy. Amen. She left that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We need to leave our water pots tonight. We need to leave our water pots tonight. Amen. Uh the things of the earth. Amen. Uh leave those things. Amen. Uh and come to him. Amen. Uh let them satisfy. Amen. Uh if you're tired of the turmoil, uh if you're tired, uh of the up and down, uh if you're tired of your soul, Amen. Uh Amen. still yearning. Amen. Come to him. Amen. And let him give you that living water. Amen. Amen. This woman came to the place tonight. This water was bu in her. She left and ran into the city said, "Come see a man. Come see a man who have told me who have told me everything." Amen. I said, "Lord, that's where we want to get to in this hour." Amen. So the place to know, Amen, that he's going to do it for you, man. So until you get to that place, &gt;&gt; until you get to that place, amen, &gt;&gt; where you just got to have him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't live without him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know how it was when you were dating, &gt;&gt; and you thought that the &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The woman you were dating, &gt;&gt; I cannot live without her. &gt;&gt; I can't go another step. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You get on the telephone, you fall asleep on the phone. &gt;&gt; You don't want to stop talking, you fall asleep on the phone. You calling, "Hey, how you doing?" You're over the house. Amen. Why? You can't live without fire. &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, if there's a year like that in our physical body, &gt;&gt; what about in my spiritual Lord God?" &gt;&gt; Lord, what about in my spiritual Lord God? uh that when I get up in the morning, Lord God, uh I know, Lord, uh I got to put on the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Uh I don't want to go without you, Lord. Uh I can't go without you, Lord. Uh so until I get the place uh that I cannot live without you, that I feel like I'm finished. Uh and then he steps in. Uh and you begin to talk like David. Uh Lord, my soul longeth after you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't want anything to take that place. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz he has in his word. Amen. Blessed is he &gt;&gt; that hunger and thirst &gt;&gt; after righteous sake &gt;&gt; they shall be filled. Amen. &gt;&gt; God will not leave you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will take care of that longing in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; So even though God placed that in us &gt;&gt; to thirst after him. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know there's also another thirst that try to bubble up. Amen. Of the flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; These two war with one another. &gt;&gt; And sometime we find people trying to live between the two. Come on now. Teach it. &gt;&gt; Some that want to take the things of the world to satisfy. Some want to take the things of the of the spirit and try to sat, you know, try to hold on to that. Amen. Uh Amen. It's got to be one or the other. Amen. Uh amen. I don't want a historic. I don't want to amusement. Amen. I want a living board. Amen. Uh but these things, they fight one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God gave us the control tower. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is something that just thirst after him. Amen. And when you come to that place, you don't want anything else. &gt;&gt; Without him, &gt;&gt; I can do nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can do nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God made us to thirst now. So we begin to talk about this spiritual thirst. Amen. Sometime we have to go into a mode of having spiritual healing. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Cuz somehow another things have come in whether it's calamities or or or sin or people or whatever it is. Amen. We've gotten into a place, amen, that we need our soul healed. &gt;&gt; There's something yearning there. There's something yearning. Amen. And God wants to satisfy that. Amen. And that's why he put in his word, amen. Isaiah, amen, 42, amen. Isaiah 42 and3 spoke of it. Amen. It prophesied, amen, of it. And Jesus came along uh in Matthew 12:20 and fulfilled what Isaiah was speaking of. Amen. When he talked about the broken reed, amen. He say a broken a a bruised reel reader shall not be break &gt;&gt; and smoke and flight shall not be quenched &gt;&gt; till he send forth judgment unto victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we find that it seems like amen. Uh you know that that that broken or that bruised reed amen. Amen. Well seem like it's at a point man that is crushed. Amen. And that it can't produce any more grain. Uh cuz the read is like a stalk. Amen. comes up. Uh but it was it was it was bruised. Amen. Uh and seem like it could not produce any more grain. Amen. Uh but Isaiah was prophesied. Amen. Uh that there's going to come a warning. Amen. Uh along Amen. Uh as a Amen. Uh Amen. that take that bruised reed. Amen. Uh and let it be able to reproduce again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember now, so when we begin to look at the translation of that word bruise, amen. Amen. The the Hebrew tell us that it means that uh that it is broken or crushed but not but not entirely but not entirely broken off. &gt;&gt; God only need but a little bit to deal with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not broken off. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the and the smoking flack. Now the the read and the flags, Amen. symbolize, Amen. our lies. Amen. Someone that you know that we're that we're weak. Amen. We're we're broken. Amen. Uh and and we're struggling. Amen. Uh you know, but here come Christ come along. Amen. And and and that and that smoke and flax. Amen. Uh Amen. It's like a wick. Amen. Uh amen. Uh that that that's almost uh Amen. But not quite. Amen. Uh amen. Distinguish. Amen. It's still got a little bit there. Amen. Uh he said, "I'm not going to I'm not going to blow it out. I'm not going to quench it." Amen. So while he comes along, Amen. Uh and it brings a healing to that broken reed. Amen. Uh that it can reduce produce again. Amen. Uh and while and he becomes a light to that wick. Amen. Uh to bring light back to it. Amen. Uh so I say Lord there is still amen. Uh as long as there's breath in his body, amen. Uh there's still a chance, oh God, uh that I can come uh to the place to experience you in this last hour. &gt;&gt; So we find so all of those things, amen, that come along. Amen. Uh because we know things come in our lives, amen, that try to get us down and bring us to the place, amen, that seem like we're crushed, amen. Uh but why? Amen. God wants to give uh spiritual healing. uh wants to bring uh amen thirst man uh that that fulfill that in your soul. Amen. Uh even Paul began to come along and say amen. Uh he said uh we are trouble on every side. &gt;&gt; The devil want to get you down. Amen. Uh put all of these things in you that is not satisfying. Amen. Uh we are trouble on every side. Amen. Uh yet not distressed. Amen. Uh we are perplexed but not in despair. Amen. Uh and I like this one. He said uh and we are persecuted uh but not forsaken. Uh cast down. Amen. But not destroy. Amen. Uh why that broken weed. Amen. Uh it's not going to be destroyed. Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll bring life back into it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you feel like you've been struggling, &gt;&gt; feel like you're weak. Amen. &gt;&gt; Feel like things are messed up, &gt;&gt; feel like that that things are just not going like it should on a innermost being. Amen. Uh he's here to heal. He's here to bring a amen fulfilling &gt;&gt; to that broken reader to that soul that's a thirst. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I say Lord I want that in my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you're longing when you're longing for something. Amen. Longing for this. Amen. Amen. He'll be that satisfying portion. Amen. &gt;&gt; I like what the scripture said. I'm trying to go you love the Lord. Amen. Oh my. Amen. Let me hurry up. Amen. I'm I'm say this. I'm going try to close. Amen. And Isaiah say, "And the Lord shall guide thee continually uh and satisfy thy soul in droughtuh and make fat thy bones uh and thou shalt be like a water garden." Amen. Uh like a spring of water whose water, amen, fail not. Amen. Uh that's what God will do for you. Amen. Uh when you need to come, amen, uh and have your soul, amen, uh satisfied. Amen.
