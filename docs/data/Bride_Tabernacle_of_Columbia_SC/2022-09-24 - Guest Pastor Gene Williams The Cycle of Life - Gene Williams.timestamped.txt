[44:19] matter how hard it gets amen he's still
[44:22] working on us tonight amen so tonight we
[44:25] just want to amen try to bring some
[44:27] words of encouragement to you because I
[44:29] believe as we reflect and look back in
[44:31] the hour that we're living in amen just
[44:33] lay down and I believe that it is the
[44:36] coming of the Lord is very soon amen I
[44:38] believe we can feel that there is a
[44:40] charge in the atmosphere that something
[44:42] is getting ready to happen we're going
[44:44] to look around the world and see why
[44:45] that's happening let me know that I can
[44:47] lift up my head to know that my
[44:49] Redemption is Joy now amen because my
[44:52] Lord is coming sooner to get me a manner
[44:55] now I can only speak for myself tonight
[44:57] amen you have to be able to speak for
[44:59] yourself amen because I know that he's
[45:01] coming soon for me amen but we find that
[45:04] one thing that we can definitely say
[45:05] that we may not be where we ought to be
[45:08] a man but I can always say that I thank
[45:11] God I'm not where I used to be now I
[45:14] know that's an old euphorism and oh I
[45:16] said but but it's a true thing amen
[45:18] because until the day God takes us out
[45:21] of here he's still working on us until
[45:24] the day that we are caught up in the
[45:26] Rapture there's still some more things
[45:28] uh that can happen in my life there's
[45:30] still a little step further that I can
[45:33] go Amanda you know I'm reminded that
[45:34] when Jesus was in the garden of God
[45:36] sending me up and every one of us would
[45:39] have a god sending me in our lives amen
[45:41] how you know he had to go a step
[45:43] furthery Manor a step furthery Manner
[45:45] and I believe that we got to go a step
[45:47] further amen amen so tonight now we just
[45:49] want to look at they'll say man about a
[45:51] man of being confident
[45:54] that he who began a good work in you
[45:57] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[46:00] Christ now we've got to make that person
[46:02] amen it's all right if I take my jacket
[46:03] off amen God is so good tonight
[46:08] not that anything it's not going to
[46:10] happen I just got harsh amen but but we
[46:13] but he who begun a good work in us will
[46:15] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[46:17] amen now one thing that I've got to
[46:20] learn is not to always uh uh you know
[46:23] you know we're so hard sometime on
[46:25] ourselves uh and on others a man of
[46:28] judging amen you know you know a judging
[46:31] amen I've been you know sometimes not
[46:33] knowing uh the soccer or where someone
[46:36] is at a manner and that brings me to my
[46:38] topic tonight Amanda the the cycle of
[46:41] life amen the cycle of life that we want
[46:44] to look at tonight uh and every one of
[46:46] us amen are going through the soccer of
[46:49] life we can look at it in the natural we
[46:51] can look at it in the spiritual but we
[46:53] all going through a cycle of life now in
[46:56] the naturally man we grow we we are born
[46:58] we come through our teenage years uh we
[47:01] come to our adult years uh then we get
[47:03] older and we start going back down the
[47:05] other way
[47:07] that's the sack of life and then one of
[47:10] these days amen is going amen but I'm
[47:12] saying God in the spiritual when I come
[47:15] to you I may not know all I need to do
[47:18] it I may not know all what that needs to
[47:20] happen but I know you're still working
[47:22] on me and there's a sack of that God has
[47:25] taken us through amen whether he's
[47:26] bringing me from justification or right
[47:29] on into sanctification or right into the
[47:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost and not on
[47:33] that but the giver himself to come
[47:36] so he's still working on me but I'm
[47:38] confident of this one thing that he who
[47:41] begun a good work in me

[47:47] Christ no matter what is happening man
[47:50] uh God is still working on me so I say

[1:08:26] season I'm skipping a lot because I want
[1:08:28] to Every Now whoever you pitching man so
[1:08:30] I I think when I'm thinking about Cycles
[1:08:32] amen I think about Moses them how God
[1:08:35] took Moses up through a socket I
[1:08:37] remember now Moses was born a proper
[1:08:40] child now Moses didn't know that but God
[1:08:44] knew that
[1:08:45] and then when his mother Jacob Bell
[1:08:47] began to teach him things uh you know
[1:08:48] and no and Moses was taking those things
[1:08:50] in her but still a matter Moses a matter
[1:08:53] amen didn't quite get to where he needs
[1:08:56] to be a manner amen there he was uh amen
[1:08:58] his first 40 years are and when God
[1:09:01] called him up he was refused of his
[1:09:02] brother
[1:09:03] he went on the back side of the desert
[1:09:06] began to hurt the Sheep 40 more years
[1:09:09] but God walked through with him yet amen
[1:09:12] God hadn't brought him to his expected
[1:09:14] end and there was Moses out there man
[1:09:16] and God cut his attention up by burning
[1:09:19] bush well he said Moses I'm not through
[1:09:21] with you
[1:09:22] hey man I'm not finished amen they may
[1:09:25] have given up on you but I haven't given
[1:09:27] up on you they may have put you aside
[1:09:29] but I hadn't put your side come on Moses
[1:09:32] I I got something for you to do amen and
[1:09:34] that's how our lives amen sometimes we
[1:09:36] think that's it lord I can't go amen
[1:09:39] nobody has anything to do with that but
[1:09:41] God is still working on you amen don't
[1:09:44] give up on yourself don't give up on God
[1:09:47] hold on hold on Amen so there were Moses
[1:09:51] amen here God had him been a long year
[1:09:54] amen being a property manner leading the
[1:09:56] children matter another 40 years and
[1:09:59] Moses I was going in the promise
[1:10:01] and why Moses 120 years God working on
[1:10:04] him inside us now if you look at Moses
[1:10:07] in the beginning you know you'd have
[1:10:08] never thought he was going to end up
[1:10:09] being a deliverer even though God
[1:10:12] already had it in his word but if you
[1:10:14] look at how he was living in Egypt being
[1:10:17] the next pharaoh
[1:10:19] sit there let them Fanning him with the
[1:10:22] big Palm leaves popping grapes in his
[1:10:24] mouth
[1:10:26] you never thought that Moses was going
[1:10:28] to be the deliverer Moses had it easy
[1:10:30] amen but that wasn't what God called him
[1:10:33] to be a man God was still working on him
[1:10:35] and the thing that he endure in his life
[1:10:38] was building him to that point amen the
[1:10:41] things he had to go through was bringing
[1:10:43] him to that party man so that's why I
[1:10:46] said God our glory in my trials I thank
[1:10:49] God why because they're building yeah
[1:10:51] they're bringing him to where I need to
[1:10:52] be a man I'm not trying to kill me that
[1:10:55] is bringing building character and
[1:10:57] bringing me where I need to be a man as
[1:10:59] God working on us amen that's what Paul
[1:11:01] said man you know Glory man the things
[1:11:03] that you go through glory in your trials
[1:11:04] and make got a greater weight coming up
[1:11:06] but we find so uh so this Moses amen God
[1:11:08] was just working on him bringing him to
[1:11:10] the place he needs to be you would have
[1:11:12] never thought that Moses would have been
[1:11:15] to deliver
[1:11:16] look at Paul
[1:11:17] you would have never thought Paul would
[1:11:19] have turned out be one of the great
[1:11:21] Apostles amen but been the one that
[1:11:23] bring light to the Gentiles they met up
[1:11:24] a man that was going up and chilling
[1:11:27] amen the people of God Amen putting them
[1:11:29] in prison Hitman standing there at the
[1:11:32] stoning of Stephen amen amen Paul's all
[1:11:34] all of that happen amen but why God
[1:11:37] wouldn't do with me man and that's why
[1:11:38] Paul could turn around and say I thank
[1:11:40] God who separate me from my mother's
[1:11:43] womb why because God had to do something
[1:11:45] for me Amen to begin to reveal something
[1:11:47] and bring him to the place that he needs
[1:11:49] to be amen I say thank God
[1:11:52] the things that may happen in life
[1:11:54] remember your beginning is not your
[1:11:57] ending
[1:11:58] your beginning is not your ending God is
[1:12:01] bringing you
[1:12:03] God is building you and God is taking
[1:12:05] care of you you love him tonight amen so
[1:12:07] we find ourselves Moses all the things
[1:12:09] that went through amen and those things
[1:12:11] were just to build him to where he needs
[1:12:13] to be man you never thought that those
[1:12:15] things that may would have brought Moses
[1:12:17] and meant to that place but God knew
[1:12:18] what he was doing so I said Thank You

[1:12:23] scripture man the book of songs amen
