[20:52] your name thank you Lord for all things
[20:55] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we
[21:01] want to look at the Book of Luke by
[21:03] God's grace Luke 23 God is good a man
[21:17] Luke 23 and we'll begin at the beginning
[21:23] at the first verse
[21:29] and it reads and the whole multitude of
[21:33] them arose and led him unto Pilate and
[21:37] they began to accuse him saying we found
[21:41] this fellow perverting the nation and
[21:42] forbidding to give to give tribute to
[21:45] Caesar and saying that he himself is
[21:49] Christ a king and Pilate said and Pilate
[21:53] asked him saying art Val the king of the
[21:55] Jews and he answered and and said thou
[21:59] says it then said Pilate to the chief
[22:01] priests into the people I find no fault
[22:04] in this man and there and they were
[22:07] there the more they were the more fierce
[22:09] saying he stirreth up the people
[22:11] teaching throughout all jury jury
[22:14] beginning from Galilee to this place and
[22:18] when Pilate when Pilate heard of the of
[22:21] Galilee he asked whether he whether the
[22:24] man were Galilean and as as soon as he
[22:28] knew that he belong unto Herod's
[22:30] jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who
[22:32] himself also had was at Jerusalem at
[22:35] that time and when Herod saw Jesus he
[22:38] was exceeding glad for he was desires to
[22:43] see him of a long season because he had
[22:46] heard many things of him and he hoped to
[22:48] see have seen some miracle done by him
[22:51] to any question with him in many words
[22:54] but he answered him nothing and the
[22:57] chief priests and the scribes stood
[22:59] really accused stood and V hemily
[23:03] accused him and Herod with his men of
[23:06] war set him at nought and mocked him and
[23:08] arrayed him in gorgeous robe and sent
[23:10] him again to Pilate the same the same
[23:12] day Pilate inherit were made friends
[23:15] together for before they were at
[23:18] intimate enmity between themselves and
[23:20] Pilate when he had called together the
[23:24] chief priests and the rulers and the
[23:25] people he said unto them ye have brought
[23:28] this man unto me as one that preferred
[23:30] the people in the whole I have examined
[23:32] him before you and found no fault in
[23:34] this man touching these things whereof
[23:37] ye accuse him
[23:38] no nor yet Herod for our sin
[23:42] you to him and lo nothing worthy of
[23:44] death worthy of death is unto Him I was
[23:48] therefore chastise him and release him
[23:49] for of a necessity he must release one
[23:52] of them that had to feast and they cried
[23:54] out all at once and away with this man
[23:56] and release unto us Barabbas who for a
[23:59] certain sedition made in the city and
[24:02] murder was cast into prison therefore I
[24:06] mean Pilate therefore willing to release
[24:09] Jesus spake unto them and but they cried
[24:13] saying crucify him crucify him and he
[24:17] said unto them the third time Why What
[24:20] evil have he done I have found no cause
[24:23] of death in him I was there for
[24:25] chastising and let him go and they were
[24:28] instant with the law requiring that he
[24:30] might be crucified the voices of them of
[24:32] the chief priests prevail and Pilate
[24:34] gave sinners that it should be as they
[24:37] required may God add the blessing to the
[24:39] reading of his word by God's grace
[24:43] tonight I just want to minister to you
[24:45] on a little something that the Lord put
[24:48] on my heart and I entitled it
[24:51] what's wrong with Jesus I said what's
[24:54] wrong with Jesus you know is very
[24:57] sitting here that we're reading today it
[25:01] is not only in this time that time but
[25:04] you know we say as a whole
[25:06] God you know God has always been
[25:11] rejected as a whole though people just
[25:14] never want it God for some reason for
[25:17] some reason you just can't grasp it in
[25:20] your mind why people don't want God you
[25:23] know the one that that made them the one
[25:26] that's creative all things the one that
[25:29] has the power we say to be get you back
[25:33] up out of the grave again give you
[25:35] eternal life he has all that all these
[25:39] things at his disposal you know he can
[25:42] judge you he can you can be eternally
[25:45] separated or you can be have eternal
[25:47] life with him but you know you can he's
[25:50] got the power in his hand to heal you
[25:52] he's got the power in his hand to
[25:55] deliver
[25:55] you to bless you abundantly above all
[25:58] things but yet for some we say odd
[26:02] reason people just don't want God don't
[26:06] understand it I was sitting there at the
[26:08] table the other day meditating I said
[26:11] for about an hour I said what's wrong
[26:14] with Jesus why people don't want so we
[26:17] find that you know I said as a whole the
[26:20] world has always rejected rejected God
[26:23] you know I went back and my mind I said
[26:25] how you know God told Samuel in one
[26:28] place
[26:29] he said Sam it ain't you that reject him
[26:31] it ain't you that they're rejecting but
[26:33] it's me he says they don't want me to
[26:36] reign over them they don't want me to
[26:38] rule over come on they'd rather have a
[26:41] man or something to rule over them
[26:43] because the thing about it a man might
[26:44] bend
[26:45] he might you know try to look over your
[26:48] faults and let you slide here there but
[26:51] it's something about people he said they
[26:53] it ain't you Sam you it's not the
[26:55] problem ain't with you the problem is
[26:57] with them they just don't want me and I
[27:00] said Lord why don't people want God and
[27:03] I said you know what happens is you know
[27:06] and even God told Samuel he says they
[27:09] didn't just start neither he said it's
[27:11] always been that way their fathers and
[27:13] their fathers and their fathers before
[27:14] them he said it always been that way
[27:17] they just they just don't they don't
[27:18] want God to reign over they don't want
[27:20] me to be their ruler and we're dealing
[27:23] with the same thing even here today you
[27:26] know the Spirit is still even lingering
[27:29] in the earth today people want to have
[27:31] church but they don't want God to be in
[27:33] there they want to have revival but they
[27:36] don't want Jesus there come on but how
[27:39] you gonna have revival without Jesus in
[27:41] the Miss how you gonna have Church
[27:43] without Jesus being there but he said
[27:46] that's that's just the way they wanted
[27:48] he said it's always been that way
[27:51] you know I thought about how you know
[27:53] when he when they was brought up out of
[27:55] Egypt you know and the thing is you know
[27:58] the first thing they did they said come
[28:01] on when they brought us out of Egypt
[28:02] they say when they soon they got out
[28:05] they said we want a calf come on you
[28:08] know the one
[28:09] you look at as what happened to him even
[28:12] Moses went into the mountain for some
[28:14] days and looked like he hadn't come back
[28:16] then the first thing they began to talk
[28:18] to Moses the way they begin to talk to
[28:20] Moses was they said we don't know what
[28:23] happened to this man come on not even
[28:26] giving him any kind of respect what
[28:30] happened to this man come on and I said
[28:32] what happens we find out today in the
[28:35] church world that people one of the one
[28:37] of the first thing they do is is they
[28:40] lose respect for the ministry come on
[28:42] and when they lose respect for the
[28:44] ministry then not knowing it within
[28:47] itself
[28:48] that's who God's using that's God's
[28:50] mouthpiece that's how God is sending a
[28:54] word to help you a word to bless you a
[28:58] word to keep you out of the trouble
[29:00] that's getting ready to come ahead a
[29:02] word to prepare you for the oncoming
[29:05] storm but yet they lose respect and when
[29:08] you lose respect for that what is it you
[29:10] lost respect for God because why that's
[29:13] just God's order God's God God's got a
[29:16] program God's got order come on but a
[29:18] lot of times everybody just want to as
[29:20] we use the terminology I want to do
[29:24] their own thing come on
[29:25] but God's got to order God's got a
[29:27] program come on and I I was saying you
[29:30] know to myself I said sometimes we don't
[29:34] like we saying we don't understand the
[29:36] road we going down we don't understand
[29:38] what God is taking us to but I was
[29:40] praying I said Lord just as we say in a
[29:43] song Lord no matter or whatever you're
[29:46] doing in this season God don't do it
[29:48] without me I don't have to be in the
[29:50] front the front line I don't have to be
[29:52] in the front of it I can be in the back
[29:53] somewhere on my knees praying but God
[29:56] whatever you doing Lord please don't do
[29:58] it without me God don't let me miss my
[30:01] don't like they say I'm on my way to
[30:02] heaven enjoy the trip don't let me miss
[30:04] the trip God whatever you doing Lord
[30:07] don't do it without me cuz even right
[30:09] now don't you know God is doing
[30:11] something this we enter season right now
[30:14] and God is doing something and the devil
[30:16] is busy they say but God is real come on
[30:19] I was I was meditating I said you know
[30:22] the enemies
[30:22] like a Floyd God's got to be lifting up
[30:25] a standard and if he's lifting up a
[30:27] standard I said God let me get me in
[30:30] that place I don't know no weights
[30:32] holding me down but God I want to be
[30:34] lifted up with you Lord but I said what
[30:38] it is people don't want God they don't
[30:40] want Jesus Wow
[30:42] that's the question we asked ourselves
[30:44] sometimes why I said you know the thing
[30:46] about it is you know we was talking
[30:49] about how they lost respect for Moses
[30:51] they lost his respect for the ministry
[30:53] but you know what it was a time when it
[30:55] was happy to see Moses coming it was a
[30:58] time even when they were still in
[30:59] bondage when Moses came on the scene oh
[31:02] the joy that fill their hearts when
[31:05] Moses came down and was and was we call
[31:08] it like this ministering the Pharaoh
[31:10] telling the Pharaoh to let the people go
[31:12] come on and they burned and start being
[31:14] easy and eased up yet all of a sudden
[31:16] Pharaoh just had to release the people
[31:18] it was a time where they enjoyed the man
[31:21] of God when they enjoyed they they were
[31:24] blessed even though Moses might have had
[31:26] some hard sermons though Moses might
[31:29] have preached some things they didn't
[31:31] like it was a time they needed God help
[31:34] they didn't they were in bondage they
[31:36] needed help so they wanted Guardian come
[31:39] on and I say that that's what we faced
[31:41] with today when people don't they don't
[31:44] they don't want guard until they get in
[31:46] bad shape until they hurtin until they
[31:49] going through and they can't see their
[31:50] way out until doors shut all in their
[31:53] face hallelujah till they in the
[31:55] midnight out and it looks like that all
[31:59] hope is lost then they cry out lord have
[32:02] mercy on me but all before you don't
[32:05] want him come on but they know that he's
[32:07] the only one can get him out of the
[32:09] shape that they're in well we find that
[32:12] and I said that's what it is my title
[32:14] tonight is what's wrong with Jesus come
[32:17] on I said people don't want them today
[32:20] get in trouble you know they reject it
[32:23] you know Oh God and Samuel thought I
[32:26] told him you know that that uh it ain't
[32:29] you that rejecting this me and see the
[32:31] thing is they don't they didn't see or
[32:34] what was getting ready to take place
[32:36] they didn't see the life was getting rid
[32:39] of cone they didn't they didn't think
[32:41] about that all they were thinking about
[32:43] was in the moments the Bible says they
[32:46] said that we want to be like the other
[32:47] nations we want to be like everybody
[32:50] else pretty much God leave us alone we
[32:52] get little we try to being different as
[32:54] a minister problem was preaching the
[32:56] other night a peculiar we don't want to
[32:58] be peculiar we want to be like everybody
[33:00] else God leave us alone but they didn't
[33:03] see the life was in the Brewin they
[33:06] didn't see the Philistine army I don't
[33:08] think you know I think about Gideon and
[33:10] all them there they didn't see a time
[33:12] was gonna come whether it was gonna be
[33:14] running they was gonna have to hide the
[33:16] blessings that God gave them because if
[33:18] the enemies saw it he was gonna take it
[33:20] from them they didn't they didn't see
[33:21] those times coming she didn't want God
[33:24] but I find I said the thing is though
[33:27] you know looking at all these things I
[33:31] said they I don't you don't understand
[33:34] sometimes why but even in all of that
[33:38] you know God is still merciful come on
[33:41] time and time again God when you when
[33:44] the people cry unto Him God always hears
[33:48] somehow it turns the ear and he hears
[33:50] their cry he said if my people that are
[33:53] called by my name if they humble
[33:54] themselves and pray seek my face and
[33:57] turn from their wicked ways God as I was
[34:00] ministering on love the other day God's
[34:02] love is just something at a place we'll
[34:05] never be able to understand without the
[34:07] Holy Ghost you won't never be able to
[34:09] understand or why God do the things that
[34:12] he does but we find that I said I said
[34:15] what's wrong with Jesus the people never
[34:17] want him until they got in trouble until
[34:20] you know Goliath showed up you know I
[34:22] was thinking about a scripture how in
[34:25] Ezekiel I believe it was Ezekiel 16 and
[34:28] how God was just looking at the
[34:31] condition that Israel had gotten in and
[34:34] then he he sent in a man a prophet he's
[34:37] just reminding him come on he said you
[34:39] know what let me take them back in their
[34:41] mind just where they were before I found
[34:43] them he says you know you were in bad
[34:46] shape before I found you come on
[34:49] and know
[34:50] time did any man ever go seeking out the
[34:52] God but God sought out to him you can't
[34:54] say that I found God
[34:55] you didn't find God God found you you
[34:58] never came God to begin to draw in on
[35:00] you and as you felt that deep call to
[35:03] the deep you responded but it was God
[35:05] the whole time and I believe that but
[35:08] you know he says in Ezekiel he says let
[35:11] me remind him he says you were in bad
[35:13] shape one time come on you don't know
[35:15] just how bad of a shape yours in he said
[35:18] your mama your mother hands you out in
[35:20] the streets said she was polluted in
[35:23] your own blood he said she needed built
[35:26] unable from you he says but you Atlanta
[35:29] he said and everybody walked by you come
[35:31] on your friends all that we were saying
[35:33] just paraphrase and everybody walked by
[35:35] you nobody wouldn't help you come home
[35:37] you he said they was sitting there
[35:39] waiting on you to die come on and I
[35:42] think about that I think about where the
[35:45] Lord pick me up from I think about how
[35:48] many that male looked at me and even
[35:51] said he ain't gonna never be nothing he
[35:54] go you know he gone too far or this boy
[35:57] never be nothing in life and then
[36:00] looking at my condition every wasn't for
[36:01] the grace of God none of us wouldn't
[36:03] never be nothing in life and he even
[36:05] right now we're only where we are
[36:07] because of what he made us and no one
[36:10] else that's it only because of what he
[36:12] doing God picked us up you don't how
[36:14] many god people God picked up and they
[36:17] wouldn't give God the glory so he put
[36:18] him right back we got him from and the
[36:21] second time was worse than the first I
[36:23] said God don't put me down Lord Oh God
[36:27] don't let me go I said Lord don't take
[36:29] your hands off me go hard but God I want
[36:32] to be thankful every day god I'm living
[36:34] it one day at a time God thank you for
[36:36] picking me up thank you for keeping me
[36:38] Lord I think we all I think I know we
[36:41] all God come on we owe him that but I
[36:44] said people don't want God God had the
[36:47] reminder
[36:47] come on he said he said you were in bad
[36:50] shape people walk by you they they
[36:53] wanted you to die he says but I saw you
[36:57] come on and when I saw you I looked at
[37:00] you and I said Lee off he said I picked
[37:03] I cleans up come on I dressed you odd
[37:07] oranjee he said it and I nourished you I
[37:10] spread my skirt up upon you
[37:13] God did some good things for you he said
[37:16] I did some great things for him he said
[37:18] but remind him where they came from
[37:19] because what it was after a certain
[37:22] period of time then they begin to say
[37:24] they didn't want to be called by the
[37:25] Lord name no more after they got on
[37:27] their feet they say okay you know it was
[37:30] a time when the Lord picked you up you
[37:32] know you thought it was an S it was
[37:34] necessary to pray you thought it was
[37:37] necessary to fast you thought it was
[37:39] necessary before you lay it down at
[37:41] night not to let the Sun go down on your
[37:43] wrath you thought it was necessary to
[37:45] read your Bible more than if you didn't
[37:48] even have nothing to eat or drink
[37:49] you thought it was necessary to stay in
[37:51] the word when God saves you you thought
[37:53] it was a necessity but when God
[37:56] sometimes we're getting the blessings we
[37:58] get relaxed we get to the point the way
[38:02] we can go out there - without praying we
[38:04] can even go out there - it up reading
[38:06] the Bible but God got to remind us where
[38:09] I picked you up from where I brought you
[38:11] from I want you to get back to that
[38:12] place hallelujah and I believe that and
[38:16] that's why I believe sometimes what God
[38:20] does guard stirs the pot some time I say
[38:24] as the Eagle stirs her nest guard stirs
[38:26] the nest sometimes God sends storms he
[38:29] does things some time to get us back you
[38:32] know to that place of what we would call
[38:35] a necessity in our lives that where we
[38:38] we need God we need are certain things
[38:43] we need to thrive off of you know you
[38:46] know Jesus said at one point he said I'm
[38:48] the vine and you're the branches he says
[38:51] you know and because when he was
[38:53] speaking of those things you know he
[38:55] says you take that branch away from the
[38:57] vine then that branch is gonna die you
[39:00] know all of the fruit you might see
[39:02] coming from that branch and you might
[39:05] see that branch striving but where it's
[39:07] getting its life from it's the vine and
[39:10] he's saying that come on you might be
[39:12] blossoming but if you if I cut you off
[39:15] or you get cut off you
[39:17] gonna blossom no more you gonna die come
[39:19] on so we have to stay connected up with
[39:23] him come on we got to stay connected up
[39:26] with that vine that's what keeps
[39:27] striving I was sharing with someone the
[39:30] other day
[39:31] uh-uh uh-uh I mean my to be enough
[39:33] forget what day it was what I was saying
[39:34] what it is you got to understand how God
[39:38] speaks I could tell you a lot of my
[39:40] experiences and how God speaks to me and
[39:43] hard no you know it's the Lord I said
[39:45] for one thing you annoyance the Lord
[39:47] you'll know if it's not the Lord if it
[39:48] ain't his word come on
[39:50] but sometimes God does something and it
[39:52] just leaves you out there in the air
[39:53] says but nobody can't be the Holy Ghost
[39:56] for you come on
[39:57] no man can be God for you a man can lead
[40:00] you to Christ but you got that you got
[40:02] to have a personal experience do with
[40:04] him you got to get down on your knees
[40:06] long enough to build a relationship with
[40:09] him that when he speaks you'll know that
[40:11] it's him speaking that you don't always
[40:13] come to a man for questions because a
[40:16] man don't always have the answers but
[40:18] God's got all the answers and sometimes
[40:20] when God don't answers we just have to
[40:22] have patience to wait on him but what is
[40:24] it you having a relationship with Christ
[40:28] that's what we enjoy we enjoy having an
[40:30] open communication with God you know
[40:33] they talk about in a marriage its head
[40:35] like a communication to kill a marriage
[40:37] come on and you being married to God
[40:40] Christ you know you being hit his bride
[40:42] the Lambs wife like a communicational
[40:45] kill that marriage as well come on and
[40:47] destroy it why because you don't you
[40:49] don't understand what God is saying come
[40:51] on you you don't you're not in tune with
[40:54] God and that's what we want to be in
[40:56] tune with God in tune with the Holy
[40:58] Ghost how many believe that tonight but
[41:01] I say I said you know what's wrong
[41:03] what's wrong with Jesus you know I think
[41:05] about here you know here like we said
[41:09] people they don't want God but we find
[41:12] that they're hearing the Scriptures you
[41:15] know I was just sitting there meditating
[41:17] it broke it brought tears to my eyes
[41:20] sitting there meditating and I even in
[41:22] prayer I just like just got so emotional
[41:25] just thinking about I said you know they
[41:28] really hated Jesus I
[41:31] they hate it I said what I said Lord why
[41:34] do they hate you so bad but you know we
[41:36] know that in the scriptures even it says
[41:38] that the Jews were blinded come on for
[41:41] that purpose but I said Lord even even
[41:44] in that I said God today why do people
[41:46] hate you so bad why I said that they
[41:49] hate it they hate it oh Jesus are so bad
[41:53] but you know in the scriptures I look at
[41:56] how you know Pilate come on he when he
[42:01] when they brought Jesus to him the Bible
[42:03] says that they were they were accusing
[42:05] him he was man he did this Jesus they
[42:09] always got something wrong they had a
[42:10] bunch of stuff wrong with Jesus come on
[42:13] what was anything wrong with him when he
[42:15] fed the 5000 wasn't anything wrong with
[42:18] him when he was doing all this miracles
[42:21] in and all the signs and wonders over
[42:24] the chief priests and the scribes they
[42:26] still hated him but you know in that
[42:28] point but I says you know when he they
[42:31] might have didn't like when he rebuked
[42:32] them and beat him out the temple they
[42:34] might of didn't like when he began
[42:36] talking hard and rush rough to him but
[42:39] the thing about it is you know they
[42:41] hated him I said Lord widely why they
[42:44] hate him so bad and even Pilate Pilate I
[42:47] thought I begin the minute I say Pilate
[42:49] examining Jesus come on and even after
[42:52] all the accusation Pilate says I don't
[42:55] see nothing wrong with him come on out
[42:58] all that y'all accusing Jesus of I don't
[43:01] see nothing wrong with the man come on I
[43:03] asked a question tonight
[43:04] what's wrong with Jesus he said I ain't
[43:07] going I ain't gonna kill him I ain't
[43:08] gonna do what y'all ask them I can't
[43:10] find no fault in him hallelujah I can't
[43:13] find nothing wrong with him and I want
[43:16] to say tonight I don't know about you
[43:17] but I can't find nothing wrong with
[43:19] Jesus he's only been good to me he might
[43:22] he might have whipped me sometimes he
[43:24] might ain't y'all ways give me what I
[43:25] wanted but God been good to me I don't
[43:28] know about you but I can't find no fault
[43:30] in them when I think about the goodness
[43:32] of Jesus and all he's done for me my
[43:35] soul cries out come on why because he
[43:38] made it for my good god mean it for my
[43:41] good I believe that
[43:43] but that's what it is pilot says I don't
[43:46] know I know I ain't find no father come
[43:50] on I said what's wrong with Jesus I
[43:52] think about here in the scriptures how
[43:55] we read and even after Pilate examine
[43:58] him he said you know what I ain't gonna
[44:00] I wasn't who put judging on I'm gonna
[44:01] send him over to here
[44:02] come on when he get over to Herod I like
[44:05] how the Bible says
[44:06] Herot was glad to see Jesus said that he
[44:08] had been wanting to see him for a long
[44:10] time why because I believe he heard
[44:13] about the goodness of Jesus I believe he
[44:15] heard about Jesus miracles and the Bible
[44:18] says that he desired to see a miracle
[44:20] the Bible says he were glad to see Jesus
[44:22] I want to say anybody still yet in the
[44:25] world today glad to see Jesus wanting to
[44:28] see Jesus wanting to have more than just
[44:30] church but I want to see Jesus and when
[44:33] Jesus comes in the building they're glad
[44:35] to see Jesus hallelujah I said Lord I'm
[44:38] glad to see you I don't know about you
[44:41] but I won't Church I want Jesus I don't
[44:43] want to see him man give me jesus that's
[44:46] who I want
[44:47] I like that hair it says he says the
[44:53] Bible says he was blade he say he wanted
[44:57] to see a miracle done bound I believe
[44:59] her might have got frustrated with him
[45:00] when Jesus would never had some a word
[45:02] but he said then they begin to mock him
[45:04] and all that but he said even in all of
[45:07] that he said man I ain't find no fault
[45:09] in him neither come on
[45:10] he might ain't do the miracle I want to
[45:12] see but I still don't see nothing in
[45:14] this man worthy of death I still don't
[45:16] see nothing adding up to the accusations
[45:19] that y'all gotta get some come on
[45:21] hallelujah that's what it is people
[45:24] complaining about Jesus they don't want
[45:26] God why because they came it's even he
[45:29] was telling them in Ezekiel you know you
[45:32] wanna use you wanna be blessed
[45:34] you wanna be adorned in my apparel but
[45:37] you want to do what you want to do but
[45:38] it don't work that way come on we have
[45:42] to find out sometimes it don't work that
[45:43] way God's got away that you can't go on
[45:47] God's got away that she can't go round
[45:50] you've got to come in by the door and he
[45:53] said Strait is the gate and narrow is
[45:55] the way only
[45:57] you don't find it come on
[46:00] only a few you know it said that in this
[46:04] age they doubted us you talk about in
[46:09] the days a lot and all those how I
[46:11] couldn't find 10 come on
[46:13] but I don't know it's something in my
[46:15] heart believing that I'm one of them
[46:16] it's something in my heart that still
[46:19] ain't gonna give up and say I'm just
[46:21] going against the odds come on but I
[46:23] believe that in my heart God didn't save
[46:26] me for no reason and you got to be
[46:28] convinced that no matter what you're
[46:30] going through God brought you in the
[46:32] kingdom at the time for this God's got a
[46:34] purpose for your life God's got
[46:36] something he want to do for you
[46:38] oh you got to do it let go and let God
[46:40] have his way in your life let go and let
[46:42] the Holy Ghost do what he want in your
[46:44] life it's not about us but it's about
[46:46] him come on
[46:48] and that's what it is you know I was
[46:51] sharing with someone that and I was like
[46:53] you know that's what it is
[46:54] you you got to find yourself come on
[46:57] sometimes you just do things until you
[46:59] find yourself you pray and you pray and
[47:02] ask God God will lead you and you'll
[47:05] find your position and when you find
[47:07] your position like we say you're thrive
[47:09] you that you find your gift you'll be a
[47:11] blessing it and nobody won't be able to
[47:13] replace you why because a man didn't
[47:15] give you that gift God gave it to you
[47:17] and once you just yield that gifts of
[47:20] God and you know a lot of times we as
[47:23] individuals have problems yielding the
[47:26] r32 gift that God gave us we have
[47:28] problems with yielding it completely
[47:31] back to God
[47:32] why because sometimes the flesh gets all
[47:37] involved and we desire within ourselves
[47:41] and and we can't say no man can say he
[47:45] don't even Paul talked about already man
[47:47] that I am he said who gonna deliver me
[47:49] from this body come on even even Paul
[47:52] and in his issue that he had going on he
[47:56] said he sought the Lord twice but the
[47:57] Lord said I allowed that he said so you
[47:59] won't think of yourself no greater than
[48:01] you ought to be come on
[48:03] so what it is you are says sometimes we
[48:06] even in finer your position I pray every
[48:08] day I said Lord help
[48:10] to give the gift back to you lord help
[48:13] me to Lord give it back to you because
[48:16] if I can't give it back to you God they
[48:18] don't you know you could perish with
[48:20] that gift
[48:20] the Bible says gifts and callings at all
[48:22] repentance but if you give that gift
[48:24] fully over to God come on and let God
[48:27] use you in that and that way then the
[48:30] glory of God you didn't got to be
[48:31] appreciative we didn't God got to be a
[48:33] single musician whatever God's use it
[48:36] it's change get God when the anointing
[48:38] comes down that's what it is when the
[48:40] presence of God come down it breaks
[48:42] yokes off people lives you know David
[48:45] had a gift that he could play the harp I
[48:47] think it was but I but I believe that
[48:49] when he played that heart change was
[48:51] broken our souls lives the Bible said
[48:53] the evil spirit had to leave on what it
[48:55] was David my team fully understand he
[48:58] might have just been playing or the
[49:00] heart but what it was God was it was the
[49:03] gift it was something that that when it
[49:05] was yielded to God it was bringing God
[49:07] down on the scene and that's what I said
[49:09] God teach us all help us all God learn
[49:12] how to get out of the way and even when
[49:14] we get in ourselves get us back on our
[49:16] knees again remind us Lord that we ain't
[49:19] nothing without you and we need your
[49:21] help Lord every day but I said what's
[49:23] wrong with Jesus come on even here you
[49:28] know say he couldn't find nothing wrong
[49:29] nothing in them so you look at and I
[49:32] says you know he's sitting them back
[49:34] over - over over to Pilate and even when
[49:38] he's sitting him back to Pilate Pilate
[49:41] the Bible say examine him again he said
[49:43] I can't find no fault on he says and he
[49:46] asked the people question I believe it
[49:48] was found here and here in the twenty
[49:51] the 22nd verse he says he says in the
[49:55] 22nd verse and he said unto them the
[49:58] third time because he a keep questioning
[50:01] Pilate begging them why why y'all don't
[50:04] want Jesus bagging with them pleading
[50:07] with him what's wrong with him come on I
[50:09] can see even the people today I see the
[50:12] ministry you know or the ones of us of
[50:17] you that have accepted Christ and living
[50:19] for them begging with people pleading
[50:21] with people why
[50:23] Jesus come on the devil got plans for
[50:26] you as Jesus told Peter once he said the
[50:29] devil he said the enemy desire to sift
[50:31] you as wheat but I prayed for you come
[50:33] on the devil desire tonight even right
[50:35] now in the midst of the crisis the
[50:38] pandemic that we're going through now
[50:39] their sin or the hornet's does what they
[50:42] call wherever they call them the killer
[50:43] Hornets then they talk about the dynamic
[50:47] monster all these things that's hitting
[50:48] the earth even in the midst of all that
[50:50] people still don't want Jesus what's
[50:53] wrong with what's wrong with Jesus you
[50:56] know he can save you from all these
[50:58] things he can shelter you in the
[51:00] midnight hour and all this going on but
[51:03] people still don't want him
[51:04] what's wrong with Jesus I think about
[51:07] Polly here the Bible says the third time
[51:10] he asks what's wrong with him come on he
[51:14] said why he said why what what evil have
[51:17] you done come on he said I find no cause
[51:20] of death to them he said I ain't gonna
[51:22] kill him I'm I'm gonna let him go I
[51:24] might chastise him but I'm gonna let him
[51:26] go I ain't got I wanna do it but they
[51:29] kept crying out do it so then even I
[51:31] thought about I says you know just for
[51:34] the sake of time I look at I says you
[51:38] know what they did they said instead of
[51:41] Jesus you know the Bible says that
[51:44] Barabbas was a man causing sedition and
[51:47] murdering in the city come on we don't
[51:50] want Jesus well give us this man that's
[51:54] drowning and seducing people that's
[51:56] committing all these crimes give us a
[51:58] killer that's what we won't give us him
[52:01] you know so he get out so he'd come out
[52:04] kill some all of us come on
[52:05] he'd come out and do some more damage in
[52:07] the city that's what we want you know
[52:09] that's what they was asking for come on
[52:12] and that's what it is don't we got to
[52:14] realize you know the devil is designed I
[52:16] would say to sift you as wheat the devil
[52:18] is just designed to break your home up
[52:20] the devil is designed to destroy your
[52:23] family the devil is destroying to have
[52:25] your design have you on a bed of
[52:27] affliction the devil is desiring one day
[52:29] to see you go to the lake of fire
[52:31] come on but is in sometimes you crying
[52:35] out I don't want Jesus
[52:37] you know I'm thinking about yeah you
[52:38] know to reject the Holy Ghost is to
[52:40] receive the mark of the beast come on
[52:42] you don't want the Holy Ghost what else
[52:44] is there left but the mark of the beast
[52:46] it's times like these they say we need a
[52:51] revival I said Lord what's wrong with
[52:53] what's wrong with Jesus you know Pilate
[52:56] even here was trying to plead with him
[52:59] but even in all of his pleading they
[53:02] still said we don't we don't want him
[53:05] you know we won't give us Barabbas we
[53:08] just we just want you to to kill him I
[53:11] said to myself I said you know just
[53:14] sitting there thinking the other day I
[53:15] says you know that today you know we beg
[53:19] and we plead with people but we said
[53:21] what's the matter with Jesus I began to
[53:23] think I said maybe maybe sometimes oh
[53:25] that person they never been I thought
[53:29] about that song he did it for me
[53:30] I said maybe they never felt lost and
[53:32] alone I said maybe they never are being
[53:36] at the bottom of the bottom maybe they
[53:39] never seen themselves in a dark place I
[53:42] said maybe you know they never been hurt
[53:45] in a free and in God come by in
[53:49] delivered there maybe they ain't ain't
[53:51] never experienced that God ever did
[53:53] anything from that day no war come on
[53:55] because God's mercies are new every day
[53:57] God a lot of times he guarded you and
[54:00] safeguards you and blessed you you
[54:01] didn't even know what was around the
[54:03] corner but God had his angels protecting
[54:05] you
[54:05] I said maybe maybe then had them times
[54:08] where people looked down on them and
[54:10] talked about them to where they cried at
[54:12] night
[54:13] maybe it ain't bid on a bed of
[54:14] affliction and God healed him maybe they
[54:17] ain't never been in those position maybe
[54:19] that's why they don't want the Lord come
[54:21] on I said God why they don't want you
[54:23] it's bad sometimes
[54:26] God got to do certain things they did us
[54:28] to call his name it's bad sometimes
[54:31] the guard got to bring us to certain
[54:33] levels of loners in our life for us to
[54:35] give him gratitude and thank him enough
[54:38] I said God I've been there I don't know
[54:40] about you but I've been in that place
[54:42] I've been in that dark spot I've been in
[54:44] those places with nobody don't want
[54:47] nothing to do which I've been there
[54:48] come on but I know it
[54:50] that time God picked me up from that
[54:52] place so I said you know they got all
[54:54] kind of names from you can call them
[54:56] he'll deliver them but I know as a
[54:59] savior I know as a redeemer one who
[55:03] saved me from a life of sin and shame I
[55:05] know him as a redeemer one who even when
[55:09] I was in my worst time but when I gave
[55:12] my life to Him came down with his spirit
[55:15] and filled me up
[55:16] that's what I know him is come on but I
[55:19] says maybe that's why I said and you
[55:22] know but the thing is I thought to
[55:23] myself I was in prayer I said Lord you
[55:27] know I said to me god I say your Savior
[55:31] you my Savior and you're my Redeemer
[55:34] I said Lord that's why I love you so
[55:36] much I says my life still ain't perfect
[55:40] I said but God you're my Savior you
[55:43] matter to others that might not be what
[55:45] they're looking at you but I said god I
[55:47] want you Lord give me you come on they
[55:51] sang the song give me you come on
[55:53] everything else can wait
[55:55] God give me you that that's all that's
[55:58] what I need
[55:59] I say guard I want you Lord when
[56:01] everybody else is saying well it's
[56:03] complaining about you and rejecting you
[56:05] and don't want to line up which I said
[56:07] God give me you Lord that's what I want
[56:09] God I want you I want your presence Lord
[56:11] I want your spirit every day of my life
[56:13] God I want you I can't find no fault in
[56:16] your Lord come on but we find that I
[56:20] said that's what that's why you know we
[56:22] love him so much I wanna let me jump
[56:24] down because I know I'm taking a lot of
[56:25] time here you know I was thinking about
[56:27] something here and here in the 27th
[56:30] verse what we're talking about what's
[56:33] wrong with Jesus here in the 27th verse
[56:36] you know Luke 23 and 27 he says when you
[56:41] know and and there followed him a great
[56:44] company of people and a women which also
[56:47] be weld and lamented him but Jesus
[56:50] turning unto them said daughters of
[56:52] Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for
[56:55] yourselves and for your children for
[56:58] behold the days are coming in the which
[57:00] they shall say blessed are the barren
[57:03] and the wombs that
[57:04] a bear in the past which never gave suck
[57:06] then shall they begin to see the
[57:09] mountains to say to the mountains fall
[57:11] on us to the hills cover us for if they
[57:14] do these things in the green tree what
[57:17] shall be done in the dry and there were
[57:20] also two other male factors led with him
[57:23] to be put to death and and when they
[57:27] were come to the place was called
[57:28] Calvary there they crucified him and the
[57:31] male factors one of the right hand and
[57:32] all on the left and she and then said
[57:35] Jesus Father forgive them for the
[57:38] forgive them for they know not what they
[57:40] do and they departed his raiment and
[57:43] cast lots
[57:44] you know I said what's wrong with Jesus
[57:46] you know one thing I thought about I
[57:48] says when the people yeah we says when
[57:51] they don't want God when they reject him
[57:54] that's cuz they don't see what's getting
[57:55] ready to come you know they didn't want
[57:58] Jesus but you know the Bible says here
[58:01] that it was women you know and coming in
[58:04] behind them and they was well but Jesus
[58:07] he turned to them on his way to
[58:09] California to die you know when he was
[58:14] on his way there he turned around and he
[58:17] looked at the women and he began to tell
[58:19] the women he said don't weep for me but
[58:21] weep for yourselves and for your
[58:24] children come on he said because the day
[58:27] coming you're gonna wish you never had
[58:29] children
[58:29] you don't people gonna run to the
[58:32] mountains and say mountains fall on us
[58:34] and I said what it is I says when when
[58:38] you reject Christ you know it ain't that
[58:42] you necessarily gonna suffer these
[58:45] things but he said your children they
[58:47] gonna bear the worst part of it your
[58:49] children come on
[58:51] he said not daughter don't weep for me
[58:53] but for yourselves and for your children
[58:55] come on that's why even in the
[58:58] scriptures it says to train up a child
[58:59] in a way that should go and it won't
[59:01] depart from him come on I said he said
[59:03] you know in all this he said this is
[59:06] what's getting ready to take place and I
[59:08] thought about that I said how do you
[59:11] reject Christ today when you reject the
[59:13] word how do you who safai them again
[59:15] today when you crucify
[59:17] how do
[59:17] he's landed again today when you reject
[59:19] his word why because he is the word you
[59:22] said in that day I wouldn't I did that
[59:24] to Jesus well how is your reaction to
[59:26] the word today how do you react when the
[59:29] word is being preached today how do you
[59:30] react when the word come to you do you
[59:33] receive the word or do you reject the
[59:34] word do you receive the will do you eat
[59:37] the whole book or do you take the book
[59:39] and cut it up into pieces and live it
[59:41] kind of way you want to live come on how
[59:43] how you do the word the Word of God now
[59:45] that's how you would have did Jesus even
[59:47] back then come on but we find that I was
[59:50] thinking about that I said Lord Jesus
[59:53] told him he said don't weep for me but
[59:55] weep for yourselves come on they didn't
[59:57] see what was getting ready to come up
[59:58] the road he's heading for your children
[1:00:00] he said it's gonna come a date you gonna
[1:00:02] you gonna you gonna curse today that you
[1:00:05] even had children come on and they'll
[1:00:07] holler right to the car to the mountains
[1:00:10] and the heels fall on us I says you know
[1:00:12] we living in such a day to day as today
[1:00:14] this man we faced with things the world
[1:00:18] has never seen before the world like we
[1:00:21] keep saying over and over and never be
[1:00:23] the same
[1:00:23] we're looking at chaos upon chaos we
[1:00:26] looking at next nobody don't know what's
[1:00:29] gonna happen next come on don't know we
[1:00:32] saying that we used to say even though
[1:00:34] we're all it's falling apart
[1:00:35] well my friends I'm afraid that the
[1:00:37] world has already fell apart and there's
[1:00:39] no repairing it come on
[1:00:40] the only thing it is now it's for us
[1:00:42] like we say to get an ark of safety get
[1:00:46] into Christ Wow he's still available
[1:00:48] come on while God is still bringing
[1:00:51] conviction on your heart you know it's a
[1:00:53] scary thing that you can hear the word
[1:00:55] but yet your heart can be so hard and
[1:00:58] they don't have no effect on you God can
[1:01:01] minister to your spirit but your heart
[1:01:02] can be so hard and that you don't you
[1:01:05] don't want to get right come on that's
[1:01:06] that's scary and a dangerous place to be
[1:01:09] in but even in the place where we are
[1:01:11] now
[1:01:12] I said God I need more I need more of
[1:01:15] your spirit God that's what I need
[1:01:16] that's what it's gonna take the demons
[1:01:18] and the things that we battle in the day
[1:01:21] we can't fight them within ourselves we
[1:01:24] got no defense outside of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:27] outside of his spirit leading and God as
[1:01:30] our eyes
[1:01:31] can't be closed all the time here's
[1:01:33] can't be shut all the time you know
[1:01:36] these five senses the gates that the
[1:01:38] devil use come on it's got to be the
[1:01:40] Holy Ghost come here take control of
[1:01:42] those gates to guard you keep things out
[1:01:45] of your spirit that are getting their
[1:01:47] corrupt you a lot of times I believe
[1:01:49] people have things going on with them
[1:01:51] and they don't even know where it came
[1:01:52] from
[1:01:53] they don't even know how it got access
[1:01:55] porn but some kind of way through some
[1:01:57] gate a demon power God in let's don't to
[1:02:00] this so it's gonna take the mercy of God
[1:02:03] they're causing the tournament come on
[1:02:05] what I say god help us god help my
[1:02:08] children God help my house my home my
[1:02:12] family Lord why we live in it some
[1:02:14] dangerous times we live it in the times
[1:02:17] like we said where the people don't want
[1:02:18] God they want things to get back to
[1:02:21] normal they don't want God they just
[1:02:24] want to go back to having church they
[1:02:25] don't want God they just want to get any
[1:02:28] money back right come on they want to go
[1:02:30] back to the beach again they don't want
[1:02:32] go hard they worried about they gonna
[1:02:34] miss the summer vacation they don't want
[1:02:37] God they worried about missing him it's
[1:02:39] true people don't want God they don't
[1:02:41] want to get out on their knees and cry
[1:02:44] out but even in these times right here
[1:02:46] I believe God got somebody you know
[1:02:49] winner even one Elijah thought he was
[1:02:51] all alone he said I got seven thousand
[1:02:53] that's still crying out how many
[1:02:55] believed that tonight you know God is so
[1:02:58] good to us his love is just by Everlast
[1:03:02] he's so kind and merciful to us I think
[1:03:06] about I says you know they hated them
[1:03:08] and even the people you know today they
[1:03:12] hate God what's wrong with Jesus that's
[1:03:17] that's just a question I wanted to ask
[1:03:19] what's wrong with Jesus
[1:03:37] the song says what's the matter with
[1:03:39] Jesus he's alright amen
[1:03:42] we serving a god that's good and I was
[1:03:46] thinking about the song where the going
[1:03:48] the scenes in the Lord keep blessing me
[1:03:50] and he keep blessing me right now and I
[1:03:54] thank God for the word that we heard
[1:03:56] tonight God keep on blessing me he meant
[1:04:01] keep right on blessing me and I said
[1:04:05] tonight as we listen to so many people
[1:04:10] can find fought in a lot of things to
[1:04:14] pretend no fault we can find in Jesus
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:20] and another song says he never failed me
[1:04:24] yet praise God we fail him all the time
[1:04:29] we failed him but he never fails us
[1:04:33] everything is more than then we can
[1:04:39] imagine more than we can axle think and
[1:04:44] what he does for us he gives us more
[1:04:47] than we deserve to have he gives us more
[1:04:53] grace not just a little bit of grace
[1:04:57] with more grace because we are still in
[1:05:05] a body that's against it our body in our
[1:05:10] flesh our flesh
[1:05:17] man this warned against our spirit man
[1:05:23] and we are constantly in a battle
[1:05:27] that's what Paul says when I desire to
[1:05:30] do good evil is present with me
[1:05:35] we're constantly in a conflict the Satan
[1:05:42] and God there's something about God in
