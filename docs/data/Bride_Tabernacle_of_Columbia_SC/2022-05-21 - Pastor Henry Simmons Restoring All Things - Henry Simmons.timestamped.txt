[35:51] as we stand for the reading of the word
[35:54] uh saint matthew 17 chapter and 10th
[35:57] verse
[36:00] saint matthew 17 and 10.
[36:03] we had so many out tonight that they had
[36:06] is getting to the end of the school year
[36:08] and so much activities going on
[36:11] so
[36:12] rachel had
[36:14] school activity and
[36:17] everybody's having school activities but
[36:19] thank god for you that made it tonight
[36:23] it says
[36:28] and his disciples
[36:30] uh 17 matthew 17 10.
[36:34] it takes you know we usually have to
[36:36] screen but
[36:37] and his disciples ask him saying
[36:41] why then said the strives that elijs
[36:45] must first come
[36:48] in the 11th verse it says and jesus
[36:50] answered and said unto them that
[36:53] truly elijah's truly shall what
[36:58] shall first come and what
[37:00] and restore all things
[37:03] but i say unto you that elijah is worth
[37:07] come already
[37:08] and they knew him not
[37:10] but have done unto him
[37:13] whatsoever they listened
[37:15] likewise shall also the son of man
[37:18] suffer of them
[37:20] may god bless you his word you may be
[37:22] seated
[37:26] we want to go back he says
[37:28] in 11th verse
[37:30] and we want to deal with the thought
[37:32] restoring all things
[37:35] restoring all things
[37:38] praise god has it ever been a time amen
[37:40] that all things needed to be restored i
[37:43] believe in this hour all things has been
[37:45] restored
[37:47] praise god we're not we're not talking
[37:49] about just things amen
[37:51] we're talking about
[37:53] a precipice
[37:54] uh god is uh talking about his specific
[37:58] and we want to show that you know in a
[38:00] moment
[38:01] but
[38:02] he said elijah's shall
[38:05] come and he said a loss has come already
[38:08] speaking to two issues the lies truly
[38:12] is going to come and restore all things
[38:16] shall come and restore all things and
[38:18] elijah has come elijah elijah has come
[38:24] and y'all didn't know him
[38:26] and you did to him whatever you listen
[38:28] so by the grace of god let's see the
[38:30] elijah that has come
[38:33] at this particular time
[38:35] and they had
[38:37] let's go to luke 1 and 17 luke 1
[38:44] and 17.
[38:48] you know when god sends
[38:50] said elijah
[38:52] a lot of times when the bible says in
[38:54] amos 3 7 surely the lord god would do
[38:56] nothing but he reveals his secrets to
[38:59] his servant the prophets
[39:02] are you with me
[39:04] so before god does any major thing
[39:07] god has a way of revealing
[39:10] what he's about to do
[39:12] before god brings judgment he always
[39:14] gives us a warning
[39:17] god don't bring judgment on a generation
[39:19] without a warning the bible said noah
[39:21] was a preacher of righteousness bringing
[39:23] in the flood but they didn't listen to
[39:25] noah they rejected known message but god
[39:28] had a way of warning the people before
[39:30] he bought the judgment
[39:33] before god does because before god
[39:35] destroyed nineveh he sent jonah jonah
[39:38] came out of the
[39:40] fish valley and god warned them before
[39:44] he destroyed it but nineveh went
[39:47] they fasted and they prayed and they
[39:48] repented
[39:50] are you with me
[39:52] so they came to repentance
[39:54] and before god does any major thing he
[39:57] would always send a warning
[40:00] we're talking about
[40:02] what's going on in russia and ukraine
[40:04] and all that and we know we're
[40:06] approaching and the earth is quaking and
[40:09] and all these things are happening
[40:14] and th these things that are happening
[40:17] it's it's scripture
[40:20] so we know
[40:22] gog and magog talking about russia and
[40:24] talking about the battle of america and
[40:26] we're talking about two worlds that pass
[40:28] in the third world coming shortly we
[40:30] talk about world war world war one world
[40:32] war ii and the third world war would be
[40:35] it
[40:36] so we'll run at that
[40:39] are you open
[40:41] well because we had the uh babylon which
[40:44] was the head of gold you know what i'm
[40:45] saying and
[40:48] i i don't want to give you too much

[40:53] about start mike

[40:57] for those that want to come a volunteer
[40:59] come
[41:00] a bible study you know i'm saying
[41:02] so by the grace of god and then we'll
[41:04] break things down a little farther
[41:07] but

[41:10] and 17.
[41:14] and as we
[41:15] had our finger on matthew there
[41:18] and i'll read matthew again
[41:20] and i'll see when i get to rushing and
[41:22] speeding up
[41:24] and then i i i might be going too fast
[41:26] for somebody and my
[41:29] hopefully
[41:30] uh i don't i don't want to do that so
[41:32] i'll slow down and let's go back let's
[41:35] hold our hands on luke and matthew okay
[41:38] matthew
[41:39] he says
[41:40] uh in 11th verse
[41:43] 17-11 and jesus answered said unto them
[41:46] elijah truly
[41:48] shall what
[41:50] first come right
[41:53] and what
[41:55] oh restore all things now hold that and
[41:58] go over to luke
[42:00] 117.
[42:04] and he
[42:05] and he shall go before him
[42:08] in the spirit and the power of elijah
[42:10] elias
[42:12] to
[42:13] turn the hearts of the world
[42:16] the hearts of the fathers to the word
[42:19] children

[42:49] at four and five behold i will send you
[42:52] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[42:54] the what
[42:57] now in the great and drafted day in
[42:59] revelation 11 these two prophets come
[43:02] moses and elijah
[43:03] but before the great that's the
[43:05] tribulation period and before the great
[43:08] and dreadful day
[43:10] we know the world is going to go through
[43:12] the mark of the beast the great
[43:13] tribulation period the antichrist time
[43:16] all of that is coming
[43:18] but before that time come
[43:20] he said i would send you
[43:22] behold i was sending to you elijah the
[43:24] prophet before the coming of the great
[43:26] and dreadful day it's going to be a
[43:28] terrible day it's a day of trouble a
[43:30] time of trouble that we've never seen
[43:32] since there was a world
[43:34] are you with me
[43:36] so that's why the time the ukraine is
[43:38] they're feeling it and i said brother
[43:41] sister we don't want to feel it in
[43:42] america but it's got to come
[43:45] they're going through their troubled
[43:47] times
[43:48] and we're praying for them
[43:51] but you said it it won't happen to a
[43:53] miracle why not
[43:55] it won't happen to the world it's going
[43:57] to reel and roll like a drunk man
[44:00] because of sin god said it in the days
[44:03] of noah as it was in the days of noah he
[44:05] said in luke 17 as it was in the days of
[44:07] noah and as it was in the days of life
[44:10] so shall it be in the day when the son
[44:11] of man is revealed
[44:13] i said we we're at this hour
[44:17] it's an hour that we should become
[44:20] desperate to get closer to god
[44:22] but instead of getting closer to god
[44:24] look like people are getting farther
[44:25] farther away from god
[44:28] we want god to help us but we don't want
[44:29] to repent of our sins men don't want to
[44:32] stop doing
[44:33] evil they don't want to turn and and
[44:35] repent and say god forgive us i'm sorry
[44:38] will the nation do that will america do
[44:41] that
[44:42] we're trying to get the abortion issue
[44:43] right we're trying to get this
[44:46] you know all of that but i
[44:49] i i'm just saying
[44:51] it
[44:52] all the king horses and all the king men
[44:55] couldn't put hump deductions together
[44:57] again
[45:00] that's old y'all might not even know
[45:02] that
[45:02] that's when we was in
[45:04] in elementary school
[45:07] but
[45:08] it's something about trying to put
[45:10] things back together
[45:12] after we go so far it's hard to try to
[45:15] put the pieces back together
[45:17] are you with me
[45:18] so men in order to repent and resp get
[45:21] it restored back so the church has gone
[45:24] through an awful condition
[45:26] went through the dark ages of history
[45:30] when the catholic church killed 68
[45:32] million
[45:33] are you with me
[45:35] and that was the dark ages of history
[45:38] but god promised that i will restore
[45:41] said the lord all the years that the
[45:42] cankerworm palmer won the locals the
[45:44] caterpillar ever eaten i will restore
[45:46] said the lord
[45:47] god promised to restore his church
[45:50] though it went through a dark time
[45:53] are you with me
[45:54] but god promised i will restore said the
[45:58] lord
[45:59] the lord to restore his people back to
[46:02] how it was and the original church
[46:06] they meant to the original word
[46:09] back to pentecost
[46:11] back to the power of the holy ghost
[46:14] back to signs and wonders
[46:17] back to miracles
[46:19] they went back to where the people
[46:21] wanted to be christians
[46:24] to love the lord thy god with all our
[46:26] heart are you with me
[46:29] when you're in love with god
[46:32] amen
[46:33] and love his word
[46:36] so he says
[46:39] and the sixth verse chromatical four he
[46:42] said and he shall turn the hearts of the
[46:44] fathers to the what
[46:47] children and the hearts of the
[46:49] disobedient
[46:51] in the hearts of the children to their
[46:53] fathers
[46:54] excuse me and
[46:56] and he should turn the hearts of the
[46:58] fathers to the children
[47:02] that was john the baptist ministry
[47:04] are you with me
[47:07] and the hearts of the children to their
[47:10] fathers
[47:12] now john the baptist came to get those
[47:14] orthodox jews
[47:17] hearts turned that they can receive
[47:18] jesus christ
[47:20] are you with me
[47:22] but at the end
[47:26] the time of restitution at the end time
[47:30] it's
[47:31] elijah was to come to turn the children
[47:33] back into
[47:36] what the fathers had established
[47:38] he said upon this rock i'll build my
[47:41] church and the gates of hell shall not
[47:43] prevail against it
[47:46] praise god
[47:47] it's all the mix-up and all the chaos
[47:50] and confusion with the
[47:53] what is it christian who is the
[47:54] christians and all that
[47:57] and people got all types of bibles all
[48:00] types of denomination all types of
[48:02] creeds and dogmas of men but god wants
[48:05] us to be
[48:06] turned back to the word
[48:09] god in simplicity
[48:12] not theology but back to the word
[48:15] amen theology would never reveal the
[48:18] word god said when the holy ghost come
[48:21] he'll teach you all things
[48:24] amen without the holy ghost the teacher
[48:26] is not there you'll never be able to
[48:29] understand the things of god except you
[48:31] have the spirit of god and they that are
[48:34] led by the spirit of god they are the
[48:36] sons of god
[48:37] all you have been
[48:39] so we need the spirit amen without the
[48:41] spirit we want to understand it the
[48:44] bible is a sealed book
[48:47] amen
[48:49] hallelujah
[48:50] so you want amen theology will never
[48:53] teach it to you
[48:55] it takes the holy ghost to reveal jesus
[48:57] christ
[48:58] jesus said
[49:00] uh when nicodemus said rabbi we know
[49:02] that thou teacher that come from god
[49:04] because no man can do these miracles
[49:06] that thou doest except god be with him
[49:10] and jesus said
[49:12] verily verily i say unto you except a
[49:14] man be born again he cannot see
[49:17] in other words he cannot understand the
[49:19] kingdom of god
[49:21] how can he see the kingdom of god amen
[49:24] if he's not born again
[49:27] amen
[49:30] said can a man in a second time into his
[49:32] mother's mood and be born
[49:35] you know it's too late
[49:37] but he said except for a man is born of
[49:39] water and of spirit he cannot enter into
[49:43] the kingdom of god
[49:45] are you with me so it takes a born-again
[49:47] experience
[49:50] are you with me not just believing
[49:53] amen we can believe but we got to keep
[49:55] on believing
[49:57] amen praise god we just can't stop till
[50:00] i accept jesus as my personal savior and
[50:02] i stopped there you got to keep on
[50:05] praise god you got to keep going
[50:07] justification sanctification baptism of
[50:09] the holy ghost
[50:11] justified then sanctified cleaned up and
[50:14] then filled with the spirit
[50:16] amen now that's three stages to the
[50:19] birth the water breaks then the blood
[50:21] the baby then the life
[50:24] are you a man
[50:26] so you must be born again
[50:32] what a blood and spirit okay
[50:34] are y'all with me
[50:35] uh
[50:37] god is good amen
[50:39] i'm running for my life
[50:43] but
[50:44] lord will let's go back to
[50:47] there must be an absolute
[50:50] there must be
[50:51] if god don't judge judge
[50:53] this earth and it's god's going to judge
[50:55] the world he's got to judge him by
[50:57] something
[50:58] and will he judge him by
[51:00] this church that church this preacher
[51:03] that preacher or what he's going to
[51:05] judge us about i said one day amen the
[51:08] book will be open
[51:10] as i said uh we got to you know get our
[51:13] direction we got to have our road map
[51:16] amen and we got to have something the
[51:19] book
[51:20] the judge has law books and he's going
[51:22] to judge you by what's in the law books
[51:25] are you with me but this is
[51:28] the book that god's going to judge every
[51:30] man by he's going to open the word and
[51:33] says did you you know here's the book
[51:36] are you with me did you keep my word you
[51:38] said well i didn't understand it
[51:40] now who's responsible for that
[51:43] amen
[51:44] god said
[51:47] faith come by hearing and hearing come
[51:48] by the word of god
[51:51] and how can he preach except you'd be
[51:52] sin
[51:54] amen
[51:56] and god sent a preacher he's going to
[51:57] preach god's word
[51:59] are you with me
[52:01] he can't preach what the church
[52:04] said that's what was wrong
[52:06] folks were saying what the church said
[52:08] they were saying what
[52:09] what they learned in school and all that
[52:12] but what about the bible
[52:14] don't let nothing
[52:16] have preeminence over the word of god
[52:20] the word must be your absolute
[52:24] amen
[52:26] so uh back to
[52:30] luke 1 here and he says in the malachi 4
[52:34] it was two things that turned the hearts
[52:36] of the children to the fathers and the
[52:38] hearts of the children
[52:39] to the fathers
[52:41] in luke 1 17
[52:44] john the baptist ministry was
[52:46] to turn the hearts of the fathers
[52:49] to the children you remember
[52:52] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[52:54] jest
[52:55] to make ready a people prepared for the
[52:57] lord
[52:59] john came to prepare he said i'm the
[53:01] voice and this oh
[53:03] that's john who are you are you
[53:05] elasticity i'm not
[53:07] they say who are you you know
[53:09] john said i'm the voice of one crying in
[53:11] the wilderness preparing the way of the
[53:13] lord
[53:15] are you with me
[53:17] jesus said if you can receive it john
[53:19] was the last
[53:21] are you whooping
[53:23] so by the grace of god it seemed to be
[53:25] somewhat confusing because john knew
[53:28] that the people at that time thought
[53:30] that he was the elijah to restore all
[53:33] things
[53:34] so john told them i'm not elijah
[53:37] but john right here zechariah is
[53:39] beginning to prophesy and tell you that
[53:42] john was elijah
[53:44] jesus said john was the light but john
[53:46] said i'm not because he knew you
[53:48] remember the jesus own disciples said
[53:51] after he rose from the dead they asked
[53:53] jesus in acts 1 master will at this time
[53:56] restore the kingdom to israel
[53:59] see what i'm saying
[54:01] are you understanding me
[54:02] they thought that we had come to the
[54:05] kingdom age and god was getting ready
[54:08] amen because they were under roman rule
[54:10] god was gonna give amen what ezekiel saw
[54:13] concerning the dry bones and the bones
[54:16] living again
[54:18] and jerusalem being turned back to the
[54:21] jews the jews still looking for that
[54:25] praise god will you restore all things
[54:27] is this the kingdom age
[54:30] praise god it was not the kingdom age
[54:32] yet
[54:33] are you coming that son of david or son
[54:36] of man
[54:37] amen
[54:38] they didn't understand that
[54:41] lord have mercy
[54:43] i'm saying this is the hour that
[54:45] we're saying some strange things if you
[54:48] it's new to your ears but
[54:50] by the grace of god i want you to
[54:51] understand
[54:52] god
[54:54] you're going to judge if you don't
[54:56] understand not enough he's going to
[54:57] judge every man by this word
[55:00] and god in this last they promised to
[55:02] restore the word
[55:04] the bible you say well everybody got the
[55:07] bible but
[55:12] he said i would that you all speak the
[55:14] what
[55:15] same
[55:17] same thing
[55:18] that there be no
[55:20] division among you
[55:23] are you with me
[55:24] so what happened it was it was a very
[55:28] it was needful that in that day that
[55:31] they speak the same thing
[55:34] they're not supposed to be somebody
[55:36] preaching this over here and somebody
[55:37] preaching that over there we're all
[55:39] going to the same heaven and all of that
[55:40] how can it be
[55:42] that god will be jesus said what i am
[55:47] the way
[55:48] the truth
[55:50] and the life
[55:52] no man can come to the father
[55:55] but by me
[55:57] isn't that right
[55:59] so jesus is the way the bible said in
[56:01] the beginning
[56:02] was the word and the word was with god
[56:06] and the word was god
[56:09] and he said in the word was me
[56:12] flesh
[56:13] are you what man
[56:15] and that was jesus
[56:16] he was the word that was in the
[56:18] beginning he said before abraham was i
[56:21] am
[56:22] aren't you glad that amen praise god
[56:25] that we got the word amen praise god
[56:28] don't i mean the pre the preacher is all
[56:30] right the church is all right but i want
[56:33] the word
[56:35] i thank god for the preacher thank god
[56:37] for the church but
[56:38] oh hallelujah your anchor holds
[56:42] in this word amen jesus said except a
[56:45] man abide in me my word abiding
[56:48] amen you got to abide in him
[56:51] praise god
[56:54] god is good
[56:57] now
[56:58] you know ii thessalonians and i'm gonna
[57:01] be real short now
[57:03] so you got questions comments i don't
[57:05] see glad to get with you
[57:07] but
[57:08] i'm
[57:09] it's just
[57:10] uh somewhat of a
[57:12] a prelude or some lesson that we
[57:15] probably have soon coming soon
[57:19] on second thursdaylonians
[57:21] two
[57:27] it says
[57:28] not because your brethren
[57:30] by the coming of the lord jesus christ
[57:33] and by our gathering together unto him
[57:37] that ye
[57:38] be not soon shaken in what
[57:42] all be troubled neither by
[57:45] the spirit nor by word
[57:49] law by letter
[57:50] as from us
[57:52] as the day of christ is
[57:56] i believe it's closer now
[57:58] that's 2 000 years over 2000 years ago
[58:01] but i believe that
[58:02] the coming of the lord is at hand
[58:06] if god get us out of here
[58:08] before the great tribulation before the
[58:10] mark of the beast before the antichrist
[58:12] and get us out of here in the rapture
[58:14] before the the world is the nuclear
[58:17] bombs are letting loose god get us out
[58:18] of here don't you want to go
[58:20] you don't want to be left around here
[58:21] with all that chaos isn't that right you
[58:23] want to be gone how are you going to go
[58:25] the bible said and we shall be changing
[58:27] the moment of what
[58:28] twinkin of an eye amen that's going to
[58:31] be a rapture we're going to be changed
[58:33] amen
[58:34] we're looking for jesus to come the lord
[58:36] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[58:38] shout
[58:39] out
[58:40] amen the lord coming back with a shout
[58:44] with the voice of an archangel
[58:47] god coming back for his people
[58:49] the ones that love him the one to give
[58:51] their life to him the one that said god
[58:53] i love you jesus
[58:56] amen if you love jesus you love his word
[58:59] and jesus is coming back for his
[59:01] children
[59:03] praise god but will we be ready to meet
[59:05] him
[59:07] and that's what it's all about god
[59:09] i mean it's it's not a
[59:11] mystified something it's something
[59:14] that's real
[59:16] jesus is real
[59:17] he loves us and he's coming back for
[59:20] those that love him
[59:22] are you with me he won't leave nobody
[59:24] behind he's not going to forget you
[59:26] because he knows each and every one the
[59:28] bible says
[59:29] nevertheless the foundation of god has
[59:31] to stand ashore having this seal the
[59:34] lord knows them that he is
[59:37] are you with me
[59:38] and don't you think god don't know you
[59:41] god know your thoughts god know what
[59:43] you're thinking the god know what you've
[59:44] been through god knows what you're going
[59:46] through and god said amen he cares about
[59:48] you
[59:49] praise god don't you know that god won't
[59:51] make no mistake
[59:53] amen
[59:54] god won't leave you behind if you want
[59:56] to go with him
[59:58] if your desire is to be raptured out of
[1:00:00] here before they make the bonds fall
[1:00:03] then god knows your desire so god will
[1:00:05] make a way for you
[1:00:06] and you say god i don't want to be left
[1:00:08] behind
[1:00:09] and you mean that with all your heart
[1:00:11] then god will make a way he provided a
[1:00:14] way for you
[1:00:15] but you know you got others that don't
[1:00:17] they don't come to that place in their
[1:00:18] life they don't never come to those
[1:00:21] moments those tender moments
[1:00:23] but you are concerned about you know
[1:00:25] this world and the status of the world
[1:00:27] and what you know just what
[1:00:30] what where am i
[1:00:31] what as an individual my life lord i
[1:00:34] don't want to be
[1:00:36] here when all of this is going on
[1:00:39] i want to be caught up to meet you
[1:00:41] i want to be in the rapture
[1:00:43] lord i want you i love you lord don't
[1:00:46] leave me in this
[1:00:48] oh you know you can't understand what's
[1:00:50] going on now
[1:00:52] all this trouble and
[1:00:54] viruses and all kinds of things just
[1:00:56] think how would be
[1:00:58] the bible said only he did not let
[1:01:00] really let till he be taken out of the
[1:01:02] way what happens when the holy ghost is
[1:01:04] lifted off the earth and it's just
[1:01:06] chaotic
[1:01:08] praise god you think you can walk the
[1:01:09] streets you think oh god
[1:01:13] it's going to be terrible
[1:01:15] schoolhouses
[1:01:17] everywhere you turn people are just
[1:01:19] you know
[1:01:20] mass shootings killings all of that what
[1:01:23] kind of world would we live in if jesus
[1:01:25] don't hurt her up and come
[1:01:27] what you don't want him to hurry up and
[1:01:29] come and you're not ready to go
[1:01:31] you say take your time lord wait a
[1:01:33] minute i got to get some things right
[1:01:36] don't hurry but wait wait
[1:01:38] you see i believe god is waiting just
[1:01:41] for the opportunity because he knows
[1:01:43] amen that you're not ready
[1:01:46] so he's waiting on that last one amen
[1:01:48] that he saw before the foundation of the
[1:01:50] world god for knew you he predestinated
[1:01:53] you to the adoption of sons
[1:01:56] are you what man
[1:01:57] so god knew that you would come to it
[1:02:00] when you hear amen because it might be
[1:02:02] an uncertain sound to somebody but it's
[1:02:04] a certain sound you know amen the bible
[1:02:07] said my sheep know my voice and the
[1:02:08] stranger they will not follow they know
[1:02:11] when they hear amen god's voice
[1:02:15] you know it's not the preacher on the
[1:02:16] pulpit it's the voice of the lord when
[1:02:18] he speaks down in you
[1:02:21] that's the voice you listen to
[1:02:23] the preacher on the pulpit if you follow

[1:06:06] they don't nothing to tell y'all that's
[1:06:08] wrong
[1:06:09] you know what i'm saying
[1:06:10] but something telling you
[1:06:12] this is wrong this is wrong don't do
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:15] you know what i'm saying even
[1:06:17] so you look back and you say what was
[1:06:18] that
[1:06:19] now when you're getting a little older
[1:06:21] in there you realize
[1:06:23] he was there all the time
[1:06:26] god was there all the time
[1:06:29] it just
[1:06:30] it just came a time that you recognized
[1:06:33] it was him
[1:06:34] all the time
[1:06:36] are you with me
[1:06:41] i don't know why i'm saying those things
[1:06:43] but god knows
[1:06:45] it says
[1:06:46] let no man deceive you by any means
[1:06:50] that's what i'm saying
[1:06:54] i know some people now and some
[1:06:57] i didn't hear
[1:07:00] troubled because
[1:07:02] it's very intense
[1:07:04] i don't want to be deceived
[1:07:08] i don't want to be deceived
[1:07:13] he said let no man deceive you
[1:07:17] the bible said the word of god is quick
[1:07:19] powerful shoveling into his sword
[1:07:22] it can discern the thoughts and the
[1:07:23] tense of the heart
[1:07:25] don't you know when god's speaking he
[1:07:26] knows exactly where you are
[1:07:29] he knows exactly what you're thinking
[1:07:31] what you're going through and he knows
[1:07:32] exactly how to let you know whether it's
[1:07:35] him or not
[1:07:37] you know somebody said nobody knew that
[1:07:39] but
[1:07:40] i didn't even speak it out loud i just
[1:07:42] thought it
[1:07:44] there was just something going on with
[1:07:45] me
[1:07:46] but god knew it isn't that right
[1:07:49] and god knew it was a time in the season
[1:07:51] that he's gonna you know
[1:07:53] don't be afraid
[1:07:55] you all said fear not
[1:07:57] it is i
[1:07:58] isn't that right
[1:08:00] you don't have to fear god when god is
[1:08:02] speaking
[1:08:05] okay he says
[1:08:08] let no man deceive you for that day
[1:08:10] shall not come except there become a
[1:08:13] what
[1:08:14] a falling away first
[1:08:17] and that man of sin be what
[1:08:20] reveal i'm gonna tell you something it's
[1:08:22] not a falling away
[1:08:24] from the church because
[1:08:26] i'm going to tell you
[1:08:28] people are going to church and
[1:08:30] it's a falling away from the word
[1:08:35] the people are falling away from the
[1:08:37] word of god
[1:08:40] church is more about entertainment
[1:08:44] you know
[1:08:45] who's got the best entertainment
[1:08:48] and young people are falling for
[1:08:50] entertainment not for the word
[1:08:54] i said i remember when we were excited
[1:08:56] these
[1:08:57] young people in college most of the
[1:09:00] college campus was going through revival
[1:09:03] and
[1:09:04] you know i'm talking about 40 something
[1:09:06] years ago
[1:09:08] everybody excited excited
[1:09:10] and it was scripturally
[1:09:12] they were excited about what the bible
[1:09:14] was saying
[1:09:16] and i said where's that excitement where
[1:09:18] we were sharing look what god said here
[1:09:21] look what god said there
[1:09:24] and everybody excited with the scripture
[1:09:26] just on fire with scripture
[1:09:28] you know what you got today i got this
[1:09:31] one this is what the lord said this is
[1:09:33] you know excitement young people you
[1:09:36] know just learning how
[1:09:38] you know to apply the word precept upon
[1:09:40] precept lying upon the line here a
[1:09:42] little they're a little i'm talking
[1:09:44] where's our excitement have you fallen
[1:09:46] in love with god because the bible says
[1:09:49] the word is god
[1:09:51] when you fall in love with the word
[1:09:53] means something god opened that up to
[1:09:55] you it speaks to you through the word
[1:09:57] and the word speaks back to you he said
[1:09:59] thank you lord thank you for loving me
[1:10:01] thank you for speaking to me thank you
[1:10:03] for talking to me
[1:10:05] you know
[1:10:08] and that's what it's all about
[1:10:10] you learn that relationship you have
[1:10:12] with god you're learning to you know to
[1:10:14] know him you know
[1:10:16] and to love him amen
[1:10:19] and when you got that going you got
[1:10:21] revival among the youth
[1:10:24] but neither youth having revival
[1:10:27] you know let's go
[1:10:28] skating let's go fishing i ain't gonna
[1:10:31] do something
[1:10:33] all kind of stuff let's go canoeing
[1:10:35] let's go to the mountain let's go ski
[1:10:37] let's go that's revival but it was a it
[1:10:41] was for souls
[1:10:42] back in the day that was exciting we're
[1:10:45] going about souls we're trying to get
[1:10:47] somebody in the kingdom
[1:10:48] amen it was about that we had a little
[1:10:50] you know picnics and stuff every night
[1:10:52] and then but the main emphasis is on the
[1:10:55] word
[1:10:56] and souls
[1:10:57] are you with me
[1:10:59] but i think
[1:11:01] uh the main emphasis is on you know
[1:11:03] trying to
[1:11:05] you know get you
[1:11:07] occupied
[1:11:09] and
[1:11:10] you know but let's not
[1:11:13] let's not leave with god out the picture
[1:11:16] the word out the picture
[1:11:19] are you with me
[1:11:20] if what was working
[1:11:23] if if it's working today then why is all
[1:11:26] this chaos in the school
[1:11:32] i'm telling you brother and sister it
[1:11:34] worked
[1:11:35] with us as youth
[1:11:37] people come off with out of the games
[1:11:41] they came off the streets they came out
[1:11:43] of prostitution they came out of this
[1:11:46] i mean
[1:11:47] i mean i know it's happening now but i'm
[1:11:49] talking about it was
[1:11:51] young people revival
[1:11:53] on fire for god with the word
[1:11:56] are you a fan it's still got some
[1:11:58] still got some
[1:12:00] but i i
[1:12:01] i just don't
[1:12:04] lord have mercy i don't want to be
[1:12:06] critical but
[1:12:08] because i don't want to i don't want to
[1:12:10] seem indifferent
[1:12:11] but brother and sister
[1:12:14] i believe there's a life that you got to
[1:12:16] live
[1:12:17] as a christian it takes a life
[1:12:22] i believe you'll see jesus christ
[1:12:25] jesus christ again walking around in him
[1:12:27] in the flesh
[1:12:29] father make them warn everyone that's a
[1:12:31] real one
[1:12:32] i knew you and me
[1:12:34] that we all might be one
[1:12:37] are you with me
[1:12:39] and that's what it's all about brother
[1:12:41] that's what it's about
[1:12:46] one more scripture and then i'm gonna
[1:12:48] close
[1:12:49] i thought i'd be shorter than this but
[1:12:51] y'all
[1:12:54] pardon me for a moment
[1:12:56] galatian one
[1:13:05] the authority is not god's word no more
[1:13:08] they're made
[1:13:11] what the church say what the preachers
[1:13:13] say the authority
[1:13:19] but
[1:13:19] the authority
[1:13:22] is the word
[1:13:23] of god
[1:13:29] god restored us back to the word i
[1:13:32] restore all things
[1:13:37] back to what the apostles
[1:13:39] preached back to what peter paul
[1:13:42] john
[1:13:44] back to the bible amen
[1:13:47] back to
[1:13:49] genesis exodus leviticus number back to
[1:13:51] the words amen amen
[1:13:54] back to truth amen
[1:13:57] back to god
[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:13:59] it says in galatians 1 6 it says
[1:14:03] i marvel that you're so soon removed
[1:14:07] there'll be a great fall in the way he
[1:14:08] said our marble that you're so soon
[1:14:10] removed from him that'll call you unto
[1:14:13] the grace of christ into another gospel
[1:14:18] which is not another
[1:14:20] but there will be some that what
[1:14:22] that trouble you and would pervert the
[1:14:24] gospel of christ
[1:14:26] but though we on angel from heaven
[1:14:29] preach any of the gospel then that which
[1:14:31] we preach
[1:14:32] unto you
[1:14:34] let him be
[1:14:36] a curse
[1:14:38] as we said before
[1:14:40] so say i now again if any man preach any
[1:14:43] of the gospel
[1:14:45] unto you then that ye have received let
[1:14:48] him be your what
[1:14:50] curse
[1:14:52] that's not another gospel
[1:14:54] it's the same bible
[1:14:57] the same word of god
[1:15:00] that's what restoring back to the bible
[1:15:02] where you can look in this book and find
[1:15:05] life
[1:15:07] you can find god
[1:15:09] because he's revealing his own word
[1:15:12] amen you got something that you can live
[1:15:14] by
[1:15:16] somebody that you can trust in this the
[1:15:18] whole the holy bible
[1:15:20] you say well which one we got so many
[1:15:22] different translations
[1:15:24] go back to the old time religion
[1:15:26] it worked
[1:15:28] are you with me
[1:15:30] don't you don't have to get all confused
