[33:40] [Music]
[33:52] romans 12 and
[33:56] 1
[33:59] and it reads i beseech you brethren
[34:03] by them by the mercies of the
[34:06] of god that you present your bodies a
[34:09] living sacrifice
[34:11] holy and acceptable unto god
[34:14] which is your reasonable service and be
[34:17] not conformed
[34:19] to this world but be transformed
[34:22] by the renewing of your mind that you
[34:24] may be
[34:25] that you may prove what is
[34:30] that good and acceptable and perfect the
[34:33] will
[34:34] of god may god it bless to the reading
[34:37] of his word
[34:38] you may be seated tonight
[34:41] by god's grace just for a moment i want
[34:45] to miss it to you on a little subject
[34:46] that uh
[34:48] lord put on my heart and ministered a
[34:50] couple of weeks ago
[34:51] and i entitled it transformation amen
[34:55] transformation looking here in the
[34:57] scriptures how
[34:59] you know it's something that the lord he
[35:02] doesn't want us like he says
[35:03] i don't want you to conform but i want
[35:05] transformation
[35:07] you know to conform be you know to
[35:10] just fit in or or by abide by the laws
[35:13] or do whatever
[35:15] you know it takes just to blend in but
[35:18] god doesn't want us
[35:20] just to blend in come on we have a lot
[35:22] of that
[35:24] in the church world where we just want
[35:26] to blend in
[35:27] come on but he says i don't want you to
[35:30] conform
[35:31] be don't be conformed to the world but
[35:34] he says i want you to be transformed
[35:37] and paul said it like this about a
[35:39] renewing of your mind
[35:41] so tonight we want to talk about a
[35:43] transformation
[35:44] you know i like how hearing the
[35:46] scriptures how he says
[35:48] you know present your bodies he says a
[35:51] living sacrifice
[35:53] holy and acceptable you know it's it's
[35:56] some things
[35:58] that we look at how you know how
[36:01] he says i want you to present it i want
[36:04] it to be
[36:05] acceptable god you know all praise isn't
[36:09] accepted by god
[36:11] all worship isn't accepted by god
[36:14] sometimes we give god
[36:16] what we think we we can we want to give
[36:19] god but you know we find out that god
[36:22] ain't going to just
[36:22] accept anything but he wants
[36:26] uh uh you to come his provided way or he
[36:29] wants
[36:30] an acceptable sacrifice come on i think
[36:33] about
[36:33] cain and abel and how cain just gave god
[36:36] the
[36:37] fruits of the land but that wasn't what
[36:39] god wanted come on
[36:40] and he even told them if you do what
[36:42] they will do he says i'll accept you
[36:44] you'll be accepted god wasn't going to
[36:47] just accept anything
[36:48] sometimes we wonder why you know
[36:52] god isn't blessing us so we've been
[36:54] rejected come on
[36:55] because we're not giving god what's
[36:57] acceptable
[36:59] come on he says a living sacrifice
[37:02] uh uh it says holy acceptable
[37:06] unto god you know i think about it
[37:09] i was meditating on the lord and how the
[37:12] children of israel
[37:13] you know at one point and many times
[37:15] they just gave god anything
[37:18] he talked about one time by the tables
[37:20] he says they're full of vomit
[37:22] he talked about in malachi how he says
[37:25] you're bringing me a lame the lame and
[37:29] and all these things to my table you
[37:32] just giving me anything
[37:34] he says and i ain't gonna accept it he
[37:36] says i'll tell you what
[37:38] he says give it to your governors or
[37:39] give it you know to
[37:41] to like we say the boss man on the job
[37:43] but give it to the
[37:44] people of the world around you and see
[37:46] will they accept it come on
[37:48] and if they you look at it he says he
[37:50] says if i be a father
[37:52] he says if you won't give that to your
[37:54] natural father and i being a father he
[37:55] says
[37:56] where is my honor he says you won't give
[37:58] it to your natural masters and i'm being
[38:00] a master
[38:01] he says whatever he says come on i'm not
[38:04] accepting that
[38:05] so we find that you know they try to
[38:08] give
[38:09] god anything but he says you know he
[38:11] says give it give it to the
[38:13] to those and and see what they accept
[38:16] come on
[38:16] but we find out that many times
[38:20] you know i says god that's why
[38:23] we were saying uh uh to ourselves
[38:26] praying that lord we want to find your
[38:28] will
[38:29] that's when we say lord we want a word
[38:31] from you the word from you that we get
[38:34] we want to know where you're leading us
[38:36] we want to know which direction you want
[38:38] to go in
[38:39] we want to know the will of god for our
[38:41] lives
[38:42] that's the word that we want not just to
[38:44] say god gonna bless you with a new car
[38:46] new house come on
[38:47] those things are good but the word that
[38:49] i want is lord your leadership and
[38:51] direction
[38:52] where where do you want me lord come on
[38:55] what do you want out of my life
[38:57] you know i want to give you god what you
[38:59] want that's the word that i need the
[39:01] leadership
[39:01] and direction of the holy ghost how many
[39:04] need that tonight
[39:05] so we find that you know i says you know
[39:08] we're looking here and i
[39:10] i said sometimes he says i want
[39:13] i want i want it i want it to be holy
[39:15] and acceptable
[39:16] you know we find that a lot of things
[39:18] like we said that we give god
[39:20] it ain't acceptable you know i thought
[39:23] about i says
[39:24] you know i was in my car today and i
[39:26] even said it the other week
[39:27] i says you know god gave you two hands
[39:30] you say why you say that because
[39:31] everybody don't have two hands
[39:34] everybody don't have that blessing to
[39:36] have two hands
[39:37] god gave us two hands come on and
[39:40] we won't even sometimes raise our hands
[39:43] to say lord thank you
[39:44] we won't worship god come on now is that
[39:47] acceptable that's unacceptable
[39:49] come on god gave us a voice didn't he
[39:53] gave us good lungs you know some people
[39:55] were born not with good lungs
[39:57] some people had lungs taken away some
[40:00] some just
[40:00] have struggled to breathe but god has
[40:02] blessed us come on
[40:04] with good lungs to breathe come on a
[40:06] good voice that we can
[40:08] stand up and and talk and sing strong
[40:11] but yet
[40:12] we won't even sing sometimes we won't
[40:14] even give
[40:15] god back what he gave us now is that
[40:18] acceptable
[40:18] that's unacceptable and i said that's
[40:21] why he says make a joyful noise unto the
[40:24] lord god gave you a voice
[40:26] and you won't even make a noise unto him
[40:28] that's unacceptable come on
[40:30] he gave your hands and you won't even
[40:32] clap them songs going on we won't clap
[40:34] our hands
[40:35] that's unacceptable come on he says give
[40:38] me what's acceptable
[40:40] hallelujah i think about brother carol
[40:42] used to say that
[40:44] he used to by the testimony about
[40:46] worrying about the shoes that he got on
[40:48] his feet
[40:48] until he saw looked over and saw a man
[40:51] that didn't have no
[40:52] legs come on then he learned come on you
[40:55] know sometimes
[40:56] god knows that we're doing the best we
[40:58] can with what we got come on
[41:01] god knows that sometimes but
[41:04] a lot of times we find out that we ain't
[41:07] doing the best we can with what god gave
[41:09] us
[41:09] but we misused things come on we misused
[41:12] the things that god has given us
[41:14] we misuse uh our time we misuse it and i
[41:18] say that why because it it becomes a
[41:20] rebuke to you
[41:21] because i said lord am and what i
[41:24] am what i've given you acceptable
[41:27] because god says i want you to present
[41:29] your bodies a living sacrifice
[41:32] holy and acceptable come on god
[41:35] sometimes open uh pulls back the veil
[41:38] and open the eyes of the people and say
[41:40] this is what you've given me
[41:41] come on in my eyes this is what it looks
[41:44] like
[41:45] come on you this is what i blessed you
[41:48] with and this is all you giving me
[41:51] i think about the ones with the talent
[41:52] he says he gave some this many some that
[41:55] many
[41:55] but and then he coming what it is he was
[41:58] holding him accountable for the things
[42:00] that he gave them
[42:01] for the gifts that he gave them and i
[42:03] says god when god you know god
[42:05] holds you accountable for the gift that
[42:06] he gave you god gonna hold you
[42:08] accountable
[42:09] because some didn't have but they did
[42:11] all they could with what they had come
[42:13] on
[42:14] hallelujah and i said god that's what we
[42:17] want to do lord i want to give you all
[42:19] we to the place in our christian journey
[42:21] in our lives
[42:23] that we know we at the end come on i
[42:25] think about the brother
[42:27] that passed away come on we don't know
[42:30] when the day of the hour gonna come
[42:32] everything might look good today but
[42:34] tomorrow god might require of you what
[42:37] did you do with the life that i gave you
[42:39] what did you do come on with the breath
[42:42] that i gave you
[42:43] then we have to beg you to praise god
[42:46] hallelujah
[42:47] come on the two hands did i have to beg
[42:50] you to lift them up
[42:51] say lord thank you then i have to beg
[42:53] you to clap
[42:54] bring noise into my storehouse come on
[42:57] hallelujah that's unacceptable
[42:59] but god wants to ex god you say he won't
[43:03] reject your praise god will accept it if
[43:05] you've given him all you got
[43:07] how many believe that tonight but we
[43:10] find that i says
[43:11] he he wants he wants things he wants
[43:14] what's acceptable you know i look at
[43:17] hearing
[43:18] how you know he's saying i want you to
[43:21] present your bodies
[43:23] as a living sacrifice
[43:26] you know a sacrifice god always says yes
[43:30] we we're presenting our bodies with
[43:32] sacrifice it ain't easy come on
[43:34] i was ministering on the other week the
[43:37] path to glory
[43:38] you know that pathway to heaven it ain't
[43:40] an easy road
[43:42] it's a hard road it's a lonely road
[43:45] it's a road where sometimes you're gonna
[43:47] have to stand by yourself
[43:49] many times what it is when you go behind
[43:51] there
[43:52] that veil is just you and god and god
[43:54] alone come on
[43:55] many times you know i think about how
[43:57] isaiah said it came the year that king
[43:59] azad died that's when i saw the lord
[44:02] god gonna have to it's gonna be waters
[44:03] of separation it's gonna be times
[44:06] where you're gonna have to walk alone it
[44:08] ain't easy role
[44:09] it's sacrifices that you've got to make
[44:11] but god
[44:12] is calling us to that then i want you to
[44:14] present your body as a living sacrifice
[44:17] you won't lose your reward the sacrifice
[44:20] that you make for god remember
[44:22] you can't give a greater sacrifice than
[44:24] what he gave for you and i
[44:26] come on and i don't believe that we can
[44:28] but we can give god
[44:30] all that we have how many believe that
[44:32] tonight but we find that
[44:34] he says you know a living sacrifice
[44:38] come on it's not that god of begs us
[44:42] or drags us but like we always say makes
[44:45] us free more agents
[44:47] you know and he he's giving you an
[44:49] opportunity
[44:50] to uh like he says i want you to be a
[44:53] living a living sacrifice and many
[44:55] times people they use that terminology
[44:58] that this is this is my life and and and
[45:02] this
[45:02] it may be true in a sense come on but
[45:04] god gave you that life but he still
[45:06] you got a choice that you can make you
[45:09] can choo you you choosing
[45:10] uh the power from the way you going the
[45:13] road that you're traveling down
[45:15] you got to make a choice but remember
[45:18] the choice
[45:18] the choices that you choose i mean the
[45:21] things you choose
[45:23] or the path you choose to go down with
[45:24] that life you're going to be held
[45:26] accountable one day
[45:28] for the choice that you made come on and
[45:30] that's one thing we don't reckon with
[45:32] sometimes
[45:33] that you know the things that we do in
[45:35] this life god gonna hold us accountable
[45:38] we don't we don't reckon sometimes that
[45:40] hey we just gonna slide but like they
[45:42] say when you know better you do better
[45:44] come on
[45:45] when you when god has opened your eyes
[45:47] and show you then he's expecting more
[45:49] out of you come on
[45:51] god when he when he anoints you and
[45:54] bless you you know
[45:55] god is expecting something in return
[45:58] come on how many believe that tonight
[46:00] god is expecting
[46:02] no you can't give god more than what he
[46:04] gave you can't repay god
[46:06] for what he's given to you but god is
[46:08] expecting something in return
[46:10] he's expecting a sold out life he's
[46:12] expecting
[46:13] somebody to testify and tell about the
[46:16] goodness of god and where he brought
[46:17] them from
[46:18] you know many times god can do something
[46:20] for somebody and they won't even tell
[46:22] what god has done for him they sit back
[46:24] and not even
[46:26] acknowledging him come on but god wants
[46:28] you to acknowledge him
[46:31] that he is that same god that he's still
[46:33] alive and well
[46:34] somebody needs to know that somebody
[46:37] need to know that god is still healing
[46:39] somebody need to know that god is still
[46:41] delivering somebody needs to know that
[46:43] the holy ghost
[46:44] is still real somebody need to know that
[46:46] prayer still works
[46:48] somebody need to know that the anointing
[46:50] still breaks jokes
[46:51] somebody need to know that hallelujah
[46:54] god don't just do
[46:55] things for us for us to sit back and
[46:57] just not even
[46:58] come on but god wants somebody to know
[47:01] that he's still lord in the earth
[47:02] how many believe that tonight
[47:06] god is so good that's why we always
[47:08] loved telling our
[47:10] testimony you know i was sharing with
[47:12] one of the guys at work and
[47:13] and how what the lord done for me and
[47:16] where
[47:17] and where it brought me from and i can
[47:18] every time i tell it sometimes
[47:20] a lot of times you can feel the presence
[47:22] of god why because
[47:24] it's what it is you realizing that it
[47:26] ain't nothing that you've done
[47:28] i was sharing with the guy i said you
[47:29] know i was at a place in my life i was
[47:32] at work i said i was at a place in my
[47:33] life
[47:34] where i needed god's help i needed god
[47:37] to deliver me
[47:38] and i said i'm still at that same place
[47:40] right now
[47:41] i need god to deliver me i mean it
[47:44] started i started
[47:45] ministering in my spirit and you know
[47:47] what the presence of god came and
[47:49] something happened in the room
[47:51] hallelujah why because i was giving god
[47:53] the glory
[47:54] and god came down i believe something
[47:57] touched his heart
[47:58] the way he can feel like god did
[48:01] something for him
[48:02] he can do it for me as well and that's
[48:04] the hope
[48:05] that we give in the world that when the
[48:06] world sees you they'll realize that if
[48:09] he did it for him
[48:10] maybe he can do it for me hallelujah
[48:13] glory
[48:14] you know sharing with a guy at work and
[48:16] and just testifying of
[48:18] another guy or something what the lord
[48:20] had done for me and
[48:21] and i said you know that's why i i'd
[48:24] love to press my way through
[48:26] that's why i love to press my way into
[48:28] prayer rest my way into things i said
[48:30] because he didn't have to do it he could
[48:32] have chose to leave me right where i was
[48:34] at
[48:35] i said but he didn't he died for me come
[48:38] on
[48:38] he reached out his hand you always sing
[48:41] that song when he reached
[48:43] down his hand come on for me i was lost
[48:46] hallelujah have you ever been lost i was
[48:49] undone without god or his son
[48:52] but when he reached down his hands for
[48:54] me oh
[48:55] jesus and i reached out i was able to
[48:58] grab that hand
[48:59] and he picked me up out of that mucking
[49:01] that maori clay and i've been running
[49:02] for my life ever since
[49:04] hallelujah you know i was sharing with
[49:07] the guy
[49:08] another guy who worked a testimony he
[49:09] said earnest you almost persuaded me to
[49:12] go to church in the morning
[49:13] and i said the thing is i thought about
[49:15] king agrippa i said i don't want to
[49:16] almost persuade you
[49:18] but i wish that you go on to the house
[49:20] of the lord because the same god
[49:22] that did it for me he's here to do it
[49:24] for you as well
[49:25] hallelujah but what it is come on
[49:29] god using what god gave you come on
[49:31] sometimes
[49:32] we think it's just the ministry or just
[49:35] the great singers or the great musicians
[49:37] come on but each and every one of us
[49:39] you know we can read further down in the
[49:41] scripture and it talks about the gifts
[49:43] that that god has given you and he has
[49:46] no respect of person
[49:47] but you got to use what god gave you
[49:50] to be a blessing to somebody else around
[49:52] you you know that's when the
[49:54] that's where the anointing is because
[49:57] all we're doing
[49:58] all all we're doing is giving god glory
[50:00] all we're doing is
[50:01] lifting him up and he'll draw the men
[50:04] unto us
[50:05] you know it's something you know i
[50:07] always think about
[50:09] in in a song got in my spirit the other
[50:12] day
[50:12] and you know i've been i've been singing
[50:14] it to myself ever since
[50:17] thinking about some trials and
[50:18] tribulations and the little song got in
[50:20] my spirit
[50:21] says that i don't feel no ways tired
[50:23] come on
[50:24] but i come too far from where i started
[50:27] from
[50:28] nobody told me that the road was going
[50:30] to be easy
[50:31] but i don't believe hallelujah he
[50:34] brought me this far to leave me
[50:36] you know i started singing that song to
[50:38] myself and the presence of god came in
[50:40] the car
[50:40] come on and i started feeling like hey i
[50:43] feel like running
[50:44] feel like i'm fresh on the page again
[50:47] starting all over
[50:48] i said when i think about where god has
[50:50] brought me from he brought me too far
[50:52] come on
[50:53] come too far from where i started from
[50:56] get behind me satan
[50:58] want to get in your mind and get you to
[50:59] turn around want to get in your mind
[51:01] tell you too tired come on i come too
[51:04] far from where i started from
[51:06] hallelujah nobody told me that the road
[51:08] was going to be easy
[51:10] god is still here right now he brought
[51:12] me right here to leave me
[51:13] hallelujah but god is still here i
[51:16] believe that
[51:18] hallelujah do it one more time lord
[51:21] i feel like samson do it one more time
[51:23] god call your spirit out
[51:25] just once more lord hallelujah you
[51:28] didn't bring me this far to leave me
[51:30] hallelujah i don't feel tired tonight
[51:33] i don't feel no way he's tired when i
[51:35] look back
[51:36] hallelujah all the storms that i've been
[51:39] through
[51:39] of the rain i think about i believe it
[51:42] was caleb he says i'm just as strong
[51:44] today
[51:45] as i was back then come on god made me
[51:48] some promises
[51:49] he promised me a mountain and that's
[51:51] what i want
[51:52] i don't want to live here without the
[51:54] promises that god made me
[51:56] hallelujah oh jesus
[51:59] come on i want to say tonight you got to
[52:01] press your way into it
[52:03] you know the devil comes to your mind he
[52:04] says i want you to be transformed
[52:06] by the renewing of your mind get your
[52:08] mind right come on
[52:09] i want your mind to be renewed remember
[52:12] that god gave you promises
[52:15] and not one of his promises will fall to
[52:17] the ground
[52:18] but they're just as real today as they
[52:20] was the day that god made those promises
[52:23] all you got to do is reach out with the
[52:25] hand of faith and
[52:26] grab hold to the word and god will bring
[52:28] it to pass
[52:29] how many believe that tonight hallelujah
[52:34] but we find that we're talking about
[52:36] like we say it's being transformed
[52:38] it's something about it it says you know
[52:40] you you can
[52:41] you can live your life the way that you
[52:44] want to desire
[52:45] but remember you'll be held accountable
[52:48] come on
[52:48] you'll be held accountable with the
[52:51] things that god has blessed you with
[52:53] you know and what you did with them come
[52:55] on but i didn't have a beautiful voice
[52:57] but you had a voice i didn't have
[53:01] i couldn't sing the best i could i
[53:03] wasn't
[53:04] able to speak but you had good lungs
[53:06] come on
[53:07] oh hallelujah don't let the tape play
[53:10] where you was
[53:11] in the service and you wouldn't clap
[53:12] your hands don't let the tape play
[53:15] when when everybody was worshiping you
[53:17] wouldn't raise your hands
[53:19] don't let the tape play when something
[53:21] you know the word was speaking to you
[53:23] and you wouldn't say amen
[53:25] don't let the tape play when you know
[53:27] that god was
[53:28] doing something in your life but yet you
[53:30] held back on him
[53:32] hallelujah that was unacceptable i say
[53:35] give god what's acceptable to him
[53:36] tonight
[53:37] hallelujah don't you know we can take
[53:40] off when we realize what god is doing in
[53:42] our midst
[53:43] i believe that hallelujah
[53:46] things happen when you begin to worship
[53:49] things
[53:50] happen when you begin to praise you know
[53:52] i've been sometimes in the prayer clause
[53:54] and the
[53:54] body be weary but then i just start
[53:56] saying thank you jesus
[53:58] thank you jesus sometimes i might just
[54:00] say thank you jesus
[54:01] i might scream out hallelujah all of a
[54:04] sudden things begin to take place
[54:06] and happen down in your spirit why
[54:08] because it's something about you
[54:10] giving god what's acceptable to him
[54:13] you've given him that press that he's
[54:15] looking forward to
[54:16] you giving it to him how many want to
[54:18] give god that tonight
[54:19] come on we're talking about being
[54:22] transformed
[54:23] hallelujah you know it's something about
[54:25] it you know what we find that
[54:27] i says what it is uh uh
[54:30] you know you can't you can't conform
[54:35] unto until that type of worship
[54:38] or that type of prayer you can't conform
[54:40] to it
[54:41] but it's something about you know a
[54:44] transformation has to take place
[54:47] and how does a transformation take place
[54:49] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[54:51] you know we find that many times we can
[54:54] come and
[54:55] many people they conform to christianity
[54:58] they they they come and they conform
[55:01] just to be in church
[55:03] but they never get that transformation
[55:06] you know we're thinking about how when
[55:08] the world
[55:09] was void and it was full of darkness
[55:12] come on
[55:13] but when god began to speak
[55:16] to that world that was void and full of
[55:19] darkness
[55:20] when god began to speak that's what it
[55:23] was
[55:24] when he began to speak transformation
[55:26] began to take place
[55:28] it was a world in darkness without form
[55:31] and without lord
[55:32] but when he began to speak when he said
[55:35] let there be light come on
[55:37] transformation took place when he said
[55:40] let the earth
[55:40] bring forth transformation started
[55:43] taking place
[55:44] come on what it was because almighty was
[55:48] speaking
[55:49] and transformation began to take place
[55:51] don't you know
[55:52] god is still speaking today let the word
[55:56] of god go
[55:56] deep enough into your spirit down to the
[55:59] realms of your soul
[56:00] that transformation can begin to take
[56:03] place many
[56:04] times we hear the word and we said it
[56:06] had no effect on us
[56:07] it's not nothing wrong with the word but
[56:09] it's the ground that's falling on come
[56:11] on
[56:12] let the ground be right when the ground
[56:14] is right and transformation will take
[56:16] place
[56:17] how many believe that tonight that's why
[56:19] we always say god
[56:20] help me create me a clean heart and
[56:23] renew the right spirit in me
[56:25] god i want to hear the word i want it to
[56:28] fall on ground
[56:29] something can happen some can begin
[56:31] changing down on the inside of my soul
[56:34] lord hallelujah transformation begin to
[56:37] take place
[56:38] that's what keeps you stirred that's
[56:40] what keeps you going
[56:42] because something is happening come on
[56:44] down in the deep
[56:45] how many believe that tonight well we
[56:47] find that
[56:48] he says i want i want you to be
[56:51] i want you to be transformed we looked
[56:54] at i said it is something
[56:56] how even the world when it was in that
[56:58] when it was in that stage
[57:00] you know he began to speak
[57:03] transformation began to take place
[57:05] things begin to happen
[57:07] and that's what it is you know many
[57:10] times
[57:10] people you can hear the preacher or you
[57:13] can just read
[57:14] the bible intellectually but nothing
[57:17] seems to be taking place
[57:19] down on the inside that's why it says
[57:21] the letter of kill
[57:22] but the spirit is what gives life come
[57:25] on the
[57:26] holy ghost bringing life to the word
[57:28] doing something
[57:29] picking it up off the pages and
[57:32] delivering it to you
[57:33] then you know we sing the song he's
[57:35] changing me come on
[57:37] from glory to glory he's changing me and
[57:40] that's what it is in our christian
[57:41] journey
[57:42] we are not being stalemate but we ought
[57:44] to be changing
[57:45] god ought to be bringing us from
[57:47] revelation to revelation
[57:49] from glory to glory you moving higher in
[57:52] god
[57:52] what it is it's the word of god
[57:54] transforming you that same
[57:56] god that spoke to a world that was in
[57:58] darkness
[57:59] and full of void that same god is
[58:02] speaking
[58:03] and just as transformation took place
[58:05] then transformation is taking place now
[58:07] people can't understand that you ain't
[58:09] who you used to be
[58:10] they think they know you but they don't
[58:12] understand what god is doing in your
[58:14] life
[58:15] hallelujah they don't understand that
[58:18] it's more than just
[58:19] my shouting and yelling and screaming
[58:21] and hollering but
[58:22] something real is taking place life is
[58:25] is starting to
[58:26] resonate hallelujah and one day
[58:30] we'll do more than just that but we'll
[58:32] be translated out of here how many
[58:33] believe that
[58:34] and i believe that come on moving us
[58:37] into a realm
[58:39] i believe of faith to where you know
[58:41] it's something
[58:42] high in the word of god he said if you
[58:44] would only believe
[58:45] all things are possible come on moving
[58:48] you into that realm
[58:49] to where you just believe all god said
[58:52] come on
[58:53] all things are possible god i'm in need
[58:55] you said all things are possible lord
[58:57] we need healing all things are possible
[59:00] let me think about a testimony someone
[59:02] told me the other day
[59:03] of what the lord done for him i said see
[59:06] he's still that same god
[59:07] he's still that miracle worker he's
[59:09] still doing the same things
[59:11] that he done when he walked the shores
[59:13] of galilee why because he's still god
[59:16] how many believe that tonight but we
[59:19] find that
[59:20] i said what it is he says don't be
[59:22] conformed
[59:23] but be but be uh transformed
[59:27] by the renewing of your mind that you
[59:29] might prove what is
[59:30] that good and acceptable and perfect
[59:33] will of god you know when when the
[59:35] transformation
[59:37] you know takes place in your life you
[59:40] you receive the baptism of the holy
[59:42] ghost
[59:42] it's not just a shout out dance but it's
[59:45] jesus
[59:46] christ a person come on living he comes
[59:49] to dwell
[59:50] in you that is no longer he is no longer
[59:53] you that's living
[59:54] i believe as paul said but it's christ
[59:56] that's living in me

[1:00:01] not
[1:00:01] who i used to be come on it's not that i
[1:00:04] always been this way
[1:00:06] well the transformation hadn't taken
[1:00:08] place yet because when the
[1:00:09] transformation takes place
[1:00:11] then all things have become new come on
[1:00:14] he says be
[1:00:15] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:00:17] that you might be able to prove
[1:00:18] that which is good the good and the
[1:00:20] acceptable will of god
[1:00:22] how are you going to prove that because
[1:00:23] it's going to be him in you
[1:00:25] uh uh doing his own will him in you
[1:00:29] using your feet using your hands doing
[1:00:31] his will the holy ghost
[1:00:33] i believe that how many believe that
[1:00:35] tonight and that's what we want i said

[1:01:19] to ourselves and let him
[1:01:21] live in us hallelujah you know when that
[1:01:24] transformation
[1:01:25] takes place it ain't what people doing
[1:01:27] to you come on because you're dead
[1:01:29] hallelujah and christ is living in you
[1:01:32] so it's not about you
[1:01:33] but it's about him hallelujah and if he
[1:01:36] can hang on a cross and say
[1:01:38] father forgive them because they don't
[1:01:39] know what they're doing if god can
[1:01:41] forgive them from what they've done to
[1:01:43] him
[1:01:43] how about you and i have forgiven each
[1:01:45] other for what the little things these
[1:01:47] light afflictions
[1:01:48] that the devil put on our lives tonight
[1:01:50] hallelujah
[1:01:51] i say that's worth my dying it's worth
[1:01:54] my crying

[1:01:57] worth my giving to make heaven my home
[1:02:00] how many believe that tonight come on i
[1:02:03] don't believe god brought you this far
[1:02:04] to leave you i believe god is still with
[1:02:07] you
[1:02:07] i believe the same god that picked you
[1:02:09] up is still right here right now

[1:02:39] get back to praying we got to get back
[1:02:41] to fasting and doing
[1:02:42] what we used to do hallelujah and he'll
[1:02:45] do what he used to do
[1:02:46] how many believe that tonight because
[1:02:48] he's the same god
[1:02:50] he's the same god and nothing can be
[1:02:53] taken away from him
[1:02:55] they say the world has changed but god
[1:02:57] ain't changed
[1:02:58] they say i don't see him but he said the
[1:03:01] world wouldn't see him
[1:03:02] but he said you'll see me because i
[1:03:04] don't am i with you but i'll be in you
[1:03:06] are you seeing god tonight
[1:03:07] hallelujah you ought to be seeing his
[1:03:10] power
[1:03:11] you ought to still be seeing that same
[1:03:13] miraculous god hallelujah
[1:03:16] let a transformation take place come on
[1:03:19] it's it's past that we conform come on
[1:03:22] just to be regular church members but
[1:03:23] transformation is taking place
[1:03:25] hallelujah we're sitting in heavenly
[1:03:27] places in christ jesus
[1:03:30] we get sitting in a company of an of an
[1:03:32] innumerable
[1:03:33] amount of angels come on hallelujah
[1:03:37] you know the atmosphere of faith the
[1:03:39] prophet of god says it invites angels to
[1:03:41] come near come on
[1:03:43] hallelujah do you believe tonight angels
[1:03:45] should come near
[1:03:47] i believe
[1:04:05] praise amen
[1:04:08] appreciate the word today amen god is
[1:04:11] good amen
[1:04:13] god power to transform amen
[1:04:16] amen it takes the power of god to
[1:04:19] transform us
[1:04:20] we can't do it on our own amen
[1:04:23] it's just like the prophet god told the
[1:04:25] story as this man was a jew
[1:04:29] and uh so
[1:04:32] he was converted to catholicism
[1:04:37] and they pulled holy war on him
[1:04:40] amen and he became a catholic amen
[1:04:44] so after he went through the rituals of
[1:04:47] becoming a catholic
[1:04:49] they sprinkled the water on him and went
[1:04:51] through the
[1:04:52] procedure and he became a catholic
[1:04:55] so the man
[1:04:59] had a ham it was on friday
[1:05:03] and he sprinkled some holy water on the
[1:05:05] ham and he said it was fish
[1:05:10] are you with me but he said
[1:05:13] him springing out holy water on that ham
[1:05:16] didn't make it a fish
[1:05:19] because they probably eat fish on friday
[1:05:22] so neither
[1:05:25] does the different rituals and things
[1:05:28] people do
[1:05:31] makes them born again make them have the
[1:05:34] holy ghost
[1:05:36] amen you got to have a real genuine
[1:05:40] transformation a real experience with
[1:05:42] god
[1:05:44] if you don't have a real experience with
[1:05:47] god
[1:05:49] you can do what the church say what the
[1:05:50] preachers say
[1:05:52] and you can please a lot of people but
[1:05:54] you got to come in that place
[1:05:56] it meant when you surrender all to god
[1:05:58] and you become one with him
[1:06:00] a real genuine experience
[1:06:04] thought about that being born again
[1:06:07] being transformed
[1:06:09] being changed from a sinner to a saint
[1:06:13] being baptized into the body of jesus
[1:06:15] christ
[1:06:16] by the spirit of the living god
[1:06:20] amen not somebody going through a ritual
[1:06:26] are you with me changing from one church
[1:06:29] one denomination to another denomination
[1:06:33] but real experience with god not having
[1:06:36] some type of thought or some type of
[1:06:38] creed it's some type
[1:06:39] a concept but a real experience with god
[1:06:43] you and god having a real experience
[1:06:46] we can come to church and we can be
[1:06:48] faithful to the church but do we have an
[1:06:50] experience
[1:06:51] in a relationship with jesus christ
[1:06:55] are we really born again are we really
[1:06:58] transformed has god
[1:07:00] transformed our lives
[1:07:03] if he did it brother and sister then we
[1:07:06] would need to walk in the power
[1:07:08] of trans for formation
[1:07:12] we ought to walk amen
[1:07:16] with the new walk amen if any man be in
[1:07:19] christ he's a new creature
[1:07:21] there's a new life amen old things have
[1:07:24] passed away
[1:07:25] all things become new that's what it all
[1:07:28] that's what it's all about brother
[1:07:29] sister
[1:07:30] let us stand god is good amen
[1:07:34] god power to transform
[1:07:38] amen not from a jew to a catholic
[1:07:42] not from a catholic to a baptist not
[1:07:45] from a baptist still pentecostal
[1:07:48] amen but amen you in christ
[1:07:52] becoming one by the baptism of the holy
