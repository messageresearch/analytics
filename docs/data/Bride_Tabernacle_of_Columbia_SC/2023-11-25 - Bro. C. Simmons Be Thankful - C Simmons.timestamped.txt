[33:55] 5
[33:57] Ephesians chapter 5 and we'll start in
[34:01] verse
[34:08] 19 and it reads speaking to yourselves
[34:11] in Psalms and
[34:14] hymns and spiritual songs singing and
[34:16] making melody in your heart to the
[34:20] Lord giving thanks always for all things
[34:24] unto
[34:25] God and the father in the name in the
[34:30] name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting
[34:32] yourself one to another in the fear of
[34:35] God and amen we'll turn to one more
[34:37] scripture first
[34:39] Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians
[34:46] 5 we'll start in verse
[34:53] 15 says see that none render evil for
[34:56] evil unto any man but ever follow that
[34:59] which is good among both among yourself
[35:03] and to all men Rejoice ever more pray
[35:06] without ceasing in everything give
[35:09] thanks for this is the will of God in
[35:12] Christ Jesus concerning you amen God
[35:15] bless reading of the word you may be
[35:19] seated amen tonight I speak on
[35:22] a very simple topic and I entitled it be
[35:26] thankful
[35:28] be thankful and I read the scriptures
[35:29] here because in verse 18 it said in
[35:32] everything give thanks in everything
[35:35] give thanks in the good and the bad give
[35:37] thanks and everything that that life may
[35:40] throw at you give thanks and said
[35:44] sometimes sometimes we go through life
[35:46] and I remember there was a a short story
[35:49] there was a they said there was a pig
[35:51] and he was under an apple tree and the
[35:53] pig was Under The Apple Tree and the
[35:55] apples kept falling out the tree and the
[35:57] pig kept eating and the pig kept eating
[35:59] but never once did the pig look up to
[36:01] look where the apples were coming from
[36:03] never once did the pig look up to be
[36:05] grateful that the apples was falling
[36:08] down and they had something to eat and
[36:10] it reminds us that sometimes that when
[36:12] God is doing great things and wonderful
[36:14] things in your life sometimes you you
[36:16] may you counting all the blessings but
[36:19] you're always wanting more and you
[36:20] forget to be thankful you forget to turn
[36:22] around and say Lord I Thank you for what
[36:25] you're doing Lord I Thank thank you for
[36:27] how you Blessing Me Lord I Thank You for
[36:29] Your many wonderful blessings that
[36:31] you're providing over my life and I
[36:33] thought about it I said many times we
[36:34] turn around and we see everyone and God
[36:37] is doing Mighty and wondrous works but
[36:39] sometimes we have to be careful to say
[36:41] Lord I Thank You Lord I Thank you for
[36:43] all the things that you've done as he
[36:45] said in James and everything give thanks
[36:48] and for this is the will of God in
[36:49] Christ Jesus concerning you it's
[36:52] something that God concerns us with that
[36:55] we remember that where I help come comes
[36:56] from we remember that what he's done for
[36:59] us and even when we look like in our
[37:02] lowest moments we can still give God
[37:04] thanks because we can realize that God
[37:06] is just working on us he's molding us
[37:09] and building us and building that
[37:10] character only so that we can make it in
[37:13] he said he's building us into a statue
[37:15] of a perfect man that's what God is
[37:17] doing and in the test and the trials I
[37:20] can still be thankful as the songwriter
[37:22] said cuz God is not through with me yet
[37:25] said God is doing a work that no man can
[37:27] do no man can can do I said I think
[37:31] about it as they said he's the pot and
[37:33] we're the clay and sometime God got to
[37:36] break the mold he got to break those
[37:38] things so that he can remold you he can
[37:40] refashion you said Lord I can be
[37:43] thankful that Lord you're making me into
[37:45] a worthy vessel Lord you're making me
[37:47] into something that you can use said one
[37:50] song writer said I want to be a willing
[37:52] vessel an instrument that you can use so
[37:55] I can be thankful in the text
[37:57] I can be thankful in the trials and be
[37:59] careful the Lord to give you all the
[38:02] things said there was some people in the
[38:04] Bible that showed us that even through
[38:06] the test and the trials they could give
[38:08] God thanks even through the hardships
[38:12] they can give God thanks and the most
[38:14] one that everyone should think about is
[38:16] job all the things that the devil took
[38:19] from him job said naked I came into this
[38:22] world and naked I shall return and he
[38:24] would never turn back on God he was
[38:26] always thankful to God for what he was
[38:29] doing even though he didn't understand
[38:31] it sometimes you may go through
[38:33] something and you say Lord why Lord why
[38:36] is this happening to me why is this
[38:39] happening to me now but those are the
[38:41] moments where you say Lord I want to
[38:43] give you thanks I want to come to you
[38:45] and say thank you Lord that you still
[38:47] are working on me I said as I spoke the
[38:50] last time I said how do you know that
[38:52] God loves you is because he's still
[38:55] working on you every day that you hear
[38:57] that voice that tell you right from
[38:59] wrong says that God is still there
[39:01] working on you he's still moving in your
[39:03] life and I can be thankful that God is
[39:05] doing that and he
[39:09] says says here
[39:11] in I'm gonna
[39:14] read real
[39:16] quick says here in James chapter one and
[39:20] I I'll read
[39:23] it in James chapter 1 and verse 2 it
[39:26] says and my brethren countered all joy
[39:29] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[39:32] knowing this that the trying of your
[39:35] faith work is patience but let patience
[39:38] have her perfect work that you may be
[39:41] perfect and entire wanting n nothing see
[39:45] and if anyone if any of you lack wisdom
[39:48] let them ask of God that God give it to
[39:50] all men liberally and unrath not and it
[39:53] shall be given him but let him ask in
[39:56] faith nothing wavering but he that Werth
[39:59] is like a wave of the sea toss With the
[40:03] Wind with the wind and tossed for let
[40:06] for let not that man think that he shall
[40:09] receive anything of the Lord a
[40:11] double-minded man is unstable in his
[40:13] ways let the brother of low degree
[40:15] rejoice in he that is exalted but the
[40:18] rich in that he is made low because of
[40:20] the flower and the grass shall pass away
[40:23] for the sun is no sooner risen with the
[40:25] burning Heat
[40:26] but it withth the grass and the flowers
[40:29] therefore falleth and the grace F the
[40:32] grace of the fashion of it perish so
[40:35] also shall the rich man fade away but
[40:37] blessed is the man that endureth
[40:39] Temptation for when he is tried he shall
[40:42] receive the Crown of Life which the Lord
[40:45] ha promised to them that loved him see
[40:48] there's something to be thankful for
[40:51] even in your test and trial there's
[40:53] something to be thankful for cuz he said
[40:55] bless is a man that endureth temptation
[40:58] but when he is tried he shall receive a
[41:02] Crown of Life I think Pastor said one
[41:04] time he
[41:06] said he
[41:08] said oh Lord it escaped me I I remember
[41:12] that and then it was
[41:14] gone oh Lord yeah it'll come back but he
[41:18] was speaking about our here he basically
[41:21] said no Crown no glory or something like
[41:23] that so sometimes you got to go through
[41:25] something to get something sometimes you
[41:28] got to do something to get something if
[41:30] you want something to happen sometimes
[41:32] in order for your car to start you got
[41:34] to turn the key in order for you to open
[41:37] the door you got to turn the door knob
[41:38] or push the door it doesn't just many of
[41:41] times it doesn't open by itself unless
[41:44] you have the automatic doors where
[41:45] you're waving your hand in front of it
[41:47] everybody understand what I'm saying so
[41:50] the door you have there's a for every
[41:53] action there's an equal and opposite
[41:55] reaction that's that's what you learn in
[41:57] in science in school so there has to be
[42:00] something but even with those I can be
[42:02] grateful for what God is doing I can be
[42:05] thankful for what God is doing knowing
[42:07] that he knows all things he knew my end
[42:10] from my beginning and he allowed me to
[42:12] go through it because he wanted to get
[42:14] Glory so I can give him thanks because
[42:17] he wanted someone to give him thanks
[42:19] that's why he went to Calvary that's why
[42:22] he shed his blood so that he could be a
[42:24] savior that's why he went there and took
[42:26] the stripes on his back so that he could
[42:29] be a Healer he said byy your stripes I
[42:31] am healed so he had to go through that
[42:34] to to to get to to be a
[42:45] Healer and he had to go through that to
[42:48] be a Healer he had to go through that
[42:50] because he was he wanted to be a savior
[42:53] and he and he did that because he loved
[42:55] us
[42:57] and said I want to read something here
[42:59] he said and Jesus was here confronting
[43:03] the greatest test that he had ever had
[43:06] um Gethsemane laid just before him where
[43:09] that he once and finally all sufficient
[43:12] test must
[43:14] come this was talking about when Jesus
[43:16] was in The Garden of Gethsemane right
[43:18] before they came and Judas portrayed him
[43:21] he said that he came to the greatest
[43:23] test that ever was performed he said
[43:26] said when the burdens of the entire
[43:28] world was laid upon his blessed
[43:30] shoulders just think about it when Jesus
[43:32] was there and he was praying and
[43:34] interceding the burdens of the entire
[43:37] world all the burdens that ever was and
[43:40] ever would come was on his shoulders and
[43:43] there was no one in all heaven or earth
[43:46] that could ever stood it but him there's
[43:49] no one that could take his place and and
[43:52] to know that all the sins of past sins
[43:56] and present sins and future sins rested
[44:00] upon this decision see that was this was
[44:03] a Monumental decision that was about to
[44:05] happen and it was one of the most
[44:07] greatest victories that Christ ever won
[44:10] or proved his great messiahship as when
[44:13] he said to God not my will thine be done
[44:18] see that was one of the most pivotal
[44:20] decisions of History cuz that was the
[44:23] only time that was the only moment that
[44:25] was the moment that God allowed us to to
[44:27] have a path to get back to heaven after
[44:30] Eve had fell and everything that had
[44:33] transpired Jesus came and he was the
[44:35] only one that could do it he said not my
[44:38] will but thine be
[44:40] thine that was the greatest Victory he
[44:42] had ever won all the Demons of Torment
[44:45] was was around to tempt him and try him
[44:49] and when we get right with God when our
[44:53] hearts become pure and the Holy Spirit
[44:56] has taken his place in our heart it's
[44:58] the most glorious thing to have
[45:00] testing the Bible tells us that our
[45:03] testing and trials are more precious to
[45:06] us than silver and gold of this world so
[45:09] we are should be thankful so they said
[45:13] we should be thankful cuz our test and
[45:16] trials are more precious to us than
[45:18] silver or gold of this world see that's
[45:21] that's what it is sometimes you look and
[45:23] you say and and you wonder why but God
[45:26] said it's worth it you got to realize
[45:28] that it's worth it and I can be thankful
[45:31] and grateful because I know it's worth
[45:33] it sister wi sings the song I know it's
[45:35] worth it I think God is worth it to make
[45:38] Heaven my home it's it's worth your
[45:40] dying it's worth your you're living and
[45:42] all you're giving say I know that it's
[45:44] worth it to make Heaven my home so I can
[45:47] be thankful and I can be grateful
[45:49] because I know it's worth it see there's
[45:51] no doubt in my mind that living a
[45:53] Christian Life is worth it there's no
[45:55] doubt in my my mind that what God can do
[45:57] for me is greater than what the devil
[45:59] can what the pathways that I choose are
[46:02] important and I can be grateful that God
[46:04] has allowed me the choice to choose the
[46:06] right thing I can be grateful that God
[46:09] has given me an opportunity each day I
[46:11] live and breathe the Lord I choose to do
[46:14] what you want me to do and I and I wrote
[46:16] down
[46:17] something I wrote down something that I
[46:19] was thinking about it as a different
[46:22] thing and I was thinking about it and I
[46:24] asked the question are you sad
[46:26] satisfied I said are you satisfied with
[46:29] what God has given you and I said I
[46:32] think about some times in the Bible
[46:34] there was people that got unsatisfied
[46:37] they looked at all they had and they
[46:38] said we want more we want more but they
[46:41] wasn't grateful they wasn't thankful I
[46:43] think about Nimrod and the Tower of
[46:45] Babel where they decided that they they
[46:48] didn't want to just have the Earth they
[46:50] wanted to go to heaven too they wanted
[46:52] to build something that they could be
[46:54] just like God they they wanted to go to
[46:56] the heavens but God God had to come and
[47:00] said they weren't thankful and grateful
[47:02] for what they had and God came and he
[47:05] confused the languages and dispersed
[47:07] them all across the Earth cuz they
[47:09] weren't grateful and thankful I think
[47:11] about the children of Israel well they
[47:14] they were getting the Angels food they
[47:17] were getting what the Angels were eating
[47:19] and they weren't grateful and thankful
[47:20] and they
[47:21] complained they complained about what
[47:24] God was giving them they complained
[47:26] about the the M they didn't realize it
[47:28] was a miracle that every day show up and
[47:31] have food on the ground it was a miracle
[47:33] to have meat come out of nowhere it was
[47:35] a miracle to have water come out of a
[47:37] rock see that it was a miracle and they
[47:40] weren't grateful and thankful for the
[47:42] cloud by day that was something they had
[47:45] gotten so used to seeing that cloud they
[47:47] wasn't grateful for it no more they
[47:49] wasn't they forgot how God had brought
[47:51] them out of Egypt they might have not
[47:53] thought about what how tremendous of a
[47:55] blessing it was for him to destroy all
[47:58] the enemies in the Red Sea it how
[48:01] grateful or how amazing it was for God
[48:04] to bring them through the plagues and
[48:06] only one plague come against them but
[48:08] God made a way of Escape for them by
[48:10] just applying the blood to their doost
[48:13] see they wasn't grateful and they got
[48:14] there and they started complaining they
[48:17] got they started saying why we got to
[48:19] eat this every day why we got to do this
[48:22] and why we got to this I don't like this
[48:25] and many of times sometime have you
[48:28] heard yourself saying I don't like this
[48:30] or I don't or I don't want this I had
[48:33] this yesterday that I don't want this
[48:36] food I had this yesterday why we got to
[48:39] eat the same thing and see that's when
[48:41] you come to the point where you realize
[48:43] that L am I not grateful am I not
[48:46] grateful for the ones that's providing
[48:48] this for me am I not grateful for the
[48:51] ones that's putting this food on the
[48:52] table and saying thank you for all the
[48:55] hard work and if they parent if your
[48:57] parents do that what more do you think
[48:59] God does for you what more do you think
[49:02] God does for you when he is the one that
[49:04] wakes you up every morning it gives you
[49:06] breath in your body just to live and
[49:09] then he gives you strength in your arms
[49:11] and your legs to walk around and pick up
[49:13] things and strengthen your hands and
[49:15] strengthen your body what more does he
[49:18] have to do for you to turn around and
[49:19] say Lord I Thank you said that he healed
[49:22] when I remember the story in the Bible
[49:24] where there was 10 lepers and they came
[49:26] to Jesus and he healed all 10 of them
[49:29] and he said go show yourself to the
[49:31] priest and they went running off and
[49:33] only one came back to say thank you
[49:36] shows you that all the rest of them they
[49:39] got what they wanted and then they once
[49:41] they got what they wanted they would
[49:42] they didn't need Jesus no more they
[49:44] didn't need Jesus no more but there was
[49:46] one that realized you know this is
[49:48] something special that just happened
[49:50] here I could have still been a leopard
[49:52] if it wasn't for Jesus I could have
[49:54] still been in my sin if it wasn't for
[49:57] Jesus I could have still been going on
[49:59] and being separated from everyone else
[50:01] and I'm grateful and I'm thankful for
[50:03] what he did for me and I want to tell
[50:05] him so I want to tell him so and
[50:08] sometimes you realize that you know what
[50:10] do I thank those ones that are around me
[50:13] the ones that I realize that it it is a
[50:15] sacrifice what they do even though you
[50:18] sometimes you say well they should do it
[50:20] cuz they such and such they my parents
[50:22] or they my grandparents or or they this
[50:25] they should do it but no they don't cuz
[50:27] there's people that don't have that that
[50:30] don't have that provided for them but am
[50:32] I grateful and thankful for what's being
[50:34] given to me each and every day am I
[50:37] grateful and turn around thank you for
[50:39] providing the food thank you for going
[50:40] to work thank you for your sacrifice
[50:43] thank you because there's some that
[50:44] don't sacrifice there's some that go out
[50:47] and they live their life and say you you
[50:49] figure it out but God has allowed you to
[50:51] have people in your life that provide
[50:54] for you that provide for you and if they
[50:56] do it how much more does God do for you
[50:59] each and every day say are you satisfied
[51:01] with what God has given you sometimes we
[51:05] we live in a society where we always
[51:07] want the next thing we always want more
[51:09] or want better we always and there's
[51:11] nothing I think you should always
[51:13] continue to improve and do those things
[51:16] but are you grateful for what's being
[51:18] given to you right now are you thankful
[51:20] and saying Lord I Thank you for what
[51:22] you've done thus far and if you don't do
[51:25] nothing else I'm still thankful if you
[51:27] don't do nothing more than this Lord I'm
[51:30] still grateful Lord if you if you don't
[51:32] give me more Lord I'm still
[51:34] thankful Lord I'm thankful I said
[51:37] sometimes they say that God can't give
[51:40] you more because you're not using what
[51:42] you
[51:43] got and and God he sometimes he waiting
[51:47] for you to turn around and say Lord I
[51:48] Thank you for what I got I thank you for
[51:51] what I got thus far and I'm grateful and
[51:53] I'm thankful for what you give given me
[51:55] thus far and Lord and Lord and and then
[51:59] God can bless you with more God can give
[52:01] you more when the children of Israel got
[52:03] grateful they realized that that that
[52:06] once they realized that they could go
[52:08] over and those ones that had passed away
[52:10] that said we can't go in the promised
[52:12] land those on God had to let them pass
[52:15] away to A Whole New Generation came so
[52:18] that they could go into the promised
[52:19] land and Joshua could lead them and say
[52:22] what God Joshua and Caleb they believe
[52:25] that what he's given us it's ours it's
[52:28] ours we can go get it and we can be
[52:30] thankful and grateful because God has
[52:32] already given us the victory God has
[52:35] already given us the victory I think
[52:37] about what what in Joshua knows in the
[52:40] story of aen God had given them that
[52:44] City and they and Joshua Joshua knew
[52:46] that God had given them the Victory and
[52:49] he question he said why are these why
[52:51] did why did these soldiers die something
[52:53] must not be right at home he had to go
[52:56] back and examine what what was in his
[52:58] home what was going on and they found
[53:01] out achen had took those things when
[53:03] they were supposed to leave it and and
[53:05] God God punished aen it wasn't anything
[53:09] that man did but God did it and then
[53:11] they went and they took that City cuz
[53:13] God had gave it given it to them and
[53:15] they was grateful and thankful CU what
[53:17] God has done many of times you don't
[53:20] understand the depths of what God has
[53:22] done for you many of times we can't
[53:26] understand the depths of what God has
[53:28] done for us we can't understand how many
[53:30] things God has blocked and kept away
[53:33] from us because of his rich and mercies
[53:36] on our lives because someone was praying
[53:38] for you when you thought you was in your
[53:40] low moment and didn't realize how much
[53:43] lower it could have been you don't
[53:45] realize how much worse it could have
[53:47] been when God just allowed you to see a
[53:50] glimpse or to experience a glimpse of
[53:53] how far it can go but God raised you up
[53:55] and said no Lord I Thank you and I'm
[53:58] grateful for what you've done I'm
[54:00] grateful for how much you spared my life
[54:03] I'm grateful for how much you blessed my
[54:05] life I've seen others that were beside
[54:08] me that have stumbled and fell but Lord

[54:12] life Lord I'm grateful for what you you

[54:24] hands and say thank you you Lord that I
[54:26] can get on my knees and say thank you
[54:28] Lord that I can stand and pray every day
[54:30] and say Lord thank you Lord Lord you

[54:37] you didn't have to wake me up this
[54:39] morning but you did you didn't have to
[54:41] give me life health and strength but you
[54:43] did and I can say thank you Lord s this
[54:45] is the season of Thanksgiving but every
[54:48] day is a moment to say Thank You Lord

[54:54] to say thank you than you Lord you have
[54:55] a roof over your head to say Thank You

[55:12] to say I want something and they living
[55:15] in poverty they're living in war turn
[55:17] and everyone's carrying guns where they
[55:19] are and we're not thankful and grateful
[55:21] that God has still allowed us the
[55:23] opportunity to come into to his house
[55:26] they come into his house and say thank
[55:27] you Lord I can come with a song of
[55:30] Thanksgiving and a song of praise cuz I
[55:32] know that God is still merciful and
[55:35] gracious to me to allow me to walk into
[55:38] these doors to say Thank You Lord thank
[55:40] you for allowing me to be here thank you
[55:42] for allowing me to listen to your word

[55:49] pray and not be persecuted that's that's
[55:52] the god that we serve that even in
[55:55] you say Lord in Wrath remember Mercy cuz
[55:59] God can take this away just like that
[56:01] and then one day you wake up and you
[56:03] can't go to church you can't you can't
[56:05] you got to hide and do these things but
[56:08] God is still allowing us a little bit of
[56:09] grace and mercy to be here to come
[56:12] together say I I got to take advantage
[56:15] of these opportunities CU you never know
[56:17] how many more you got left just in the
[56:20] hospital the other day and I I was
[56:22] looking there and I was said Lord God
[56:25] can do anything because he's God but
[56:28] some days you got to think about it well
[56:30] if God don't raise you up are you ready
[56:33] are you ready to go and every day
[56:35] everybody's walking around even if
[56:37] you're healthy you could be gone
[56:39] tomorrow just like that and you just say
[56:42] I seen people young people that's gone
[56:44] they wake up one day and then they then
[56:46] they gone the next day you say what
[56:48] happened they can't even find some some
[56:51] of the things that are wrong with them
[56:52] but each and every day I can be thankful
[56:54] and grateful to God that God has given
[56:57] me an opportunity to give him praise God
[57:00] has given me an opportunity to come to
[57:02] him and say thank you God has given me
[57:04] an opportunity said Lord if this is my
[57:07] day Lord I want to make sure everything

[57:36] all look up and say Lord I want to be
[57:39] thankful I I and you say I might not
[57:41] have much to thank you for but each of
[57:43] us got something to thank God for no
[57:46] matter how old you are how young you are
[57:49] you got a reason to say Lord I thank you
[57:51] because of what you've done for me and
[57:54] you may not stand everything but you can
[57:56] thank God for what he's done for you in
[57:59] the small
[58:02] things in the Small Things cuz God has
[58:05] been good whether you recognize it or
[58:07] not God is still good says sometime God

[59:25] I
[59:26] was in the restaurant and had a
[59:31] buffet and um had a young fell in there
[59:35] he probably in his 30s or
[59:39] 40s and I look like he's just finished

[59:50] pound and I I saw him because he had a
[59:54] walker
[59:55] he was rocking in his seat trying to get
[59:59] up and I thought about I said Oh I
[1:00:02] thought about my days working in the
[1:00:03] hospital how patients couldn't get up
[1:00:07] and nobody wanted to help them so I said
[1:00:10] even though I'm old and gray-headed I
[1:00:13] thought in my head myself let me go over
[1:00:15] here help this man CU he look like he
[1:00:18] finish eating I'm going to help him get
[1:00:23] up and now um you kept rocking and
[1:00:27] something said hold
[1:00:30] up I said okay hold up and he rocked and
[1:00:35] he rocked and he got up and I thought he
[1:00:37] was
[1:00:38] going he got two plates and stack
[1:00:42] stacked them up I said Lord have mercy I
[1:00:47] I said I'm going to help him go back to
[1:00:48] that bar again and get two more plates
[1:00:52] and pile them up I said
[1:00:55] you know that's
[1:00:57] something you know I felt so sorry for
[1:01:00] it I felt so
[1:01:03] sorry I said Lord and then I was
[1:01:05] thankful as I was listening to the
[1:01:08] message tonight I was
[1:01:09] thankful when I got my fence go for the
[1:01:13] year and the doctor called me he says
[1:01:17] everything is good everything is good
[1:01:20] you said just lose some
[1:01:23] weight you need to lose some more you
[1:01:26] need to lose
[1:01:27] weight and every with no diabetes no
[1:01:31] high blood no this no that you all right
[1:01:34] just lose some weight
[1:01:36] now okay so uh I was thankful
[1:01:43] because I was feeling pretty good when
[1:01:46] you hear good report like that and you
[1:01:47] feel so good and you want to get out and
[1:01:51] maybe run a mile or
[1:01:53] something you feel so good you know you
[1:01:57] go to the doctor and he tell you I'll
[1:01:59] see you next year I don't want to go at
[1:02:02] all just to get a report I just don't
[1:02:06] like going to the doctor
[1:02:09] just you know I thought
[1:02:12] about some days you wake up and you're
[1:02:15] in pain most of these young people don't
[1:02:18] know what it feels like to really be
[1:02:21] in terrible pain
[1:02:25] but but if you had a day of severe
[1:02:29] pain and most of the time you lived long
[1:02:32] enough you've had some days where you
[1:02:34] had some aches and some really serious
[1:02:39] pain and
[1:02:42] sometimes when you don't have the pain
[1:02:44] you can say thank you
[1:02:46] Lord It's good to wake up and I can walk
[1:02:49] and I'm not in pain and not
[1:02:52] hurting feeling good
[1:02:55] good some days you get up you got
[1:02:59] arthritis some days you get up and you
[1:03:01] just sluggish and they but when you can
[1:03:05] get up and you feel
[1:03:07] good and sometimes I think when you're
[1:03:10] young you don't even think
[1:03:12] about feeling
[1:03:14] bad and if you felt bad you think you Fe
[1:03:17] you think you really bad just feel a
[1:03:19] little bit of bad you think I'm really
[1:03:22] bad ain't got old enough to feel real
[1:03:26] bad a sick enough to get to feel real
[1:03:30] bad that's all you know folks say well
[1:03:34] so but being grateful and being thankful
[1:03:38] that God is bless you and special way
