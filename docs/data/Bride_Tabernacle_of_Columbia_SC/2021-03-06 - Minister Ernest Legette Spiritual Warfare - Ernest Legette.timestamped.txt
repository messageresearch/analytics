[23:47] against the wiles of the devil for we
[23:49] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[23:51] against principalities and powers
[23:54] against the rulers of darkness of this
[23:56] world against spiritual wickedness in
[23:58] high places
[23:59] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[24:03] of god that you may be able to stand

[24:12] with bout with truth
[24:14] and having on the breastplate of

[24:25] able to quench the fiery darts of the
[24:27] wicked and
[24:28] take the helmet of salvation and the
[24:31] sword of the spirit
[24:32] which is the word of god praying always
[24:35] with all
[24:36] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[24:38] and watching
[24:39] there unto with all perseverance and
[24:42] supplication
[24:43] for all saints for and for me
[24:47] that utterance may be given unto me that
[24:49] i may open my mouth boldly
[24:51] and make known the mystery of the gospel
[24:54] for i for which i am an ambassador in
[24:56] bonds
[24:57] that therein i may speak boldly as i
[25:00] ought
[25:01] to speak may god has blessed to the
[25:03] reading of his word he may be seated
[25:08] tonight by god's grace just for a moment
[25:11] i want to i want to minister on a topic
[25:13] and i entitled it spiritual warfare
[25:15] amen spiritual warfare
[25:18] you know i i said that sometimes we lose
[25:22] the
[25:22] we lose the the thought process of
[25:26] that we're constantly in the battle
[25:29] we're constantly every day we wake up
[25:30] we're in a battle
[25:32] we're not battling like the bible says
[25:34] this isn't a flesh and blood affair
[25:36] but it's a spiritual battle he talked
[25:39] about spiritual wickedness in high
[25:41] places
[25:42] you know and things he says that we
[25:45] wrestle not against spirits
[25:46] flesh and blood but against spiritual
[25:48] principalities against powers against
[25:50] rulers of darkness of this world against
[25:52] spiritual wickedness
[25:53] in high places you know i i believe that
[25:56] and everything that
[25:57] would exalt itself i would say against
[25:59] the knowledge of god we're fighting
[26:00] against it today
[26:02] and we lose that we lose that mind frame
[26:04] sometime that
[26:06] we ain't on a picnic but we're on a
[26:07] battlefield
[26:09] and we're fighting so you know at the
[26:12] times we think that it's a peace
[26:14] remember we're still in battle we're
[26:17] still in war
[26:18] the devil the devil ain't gonna stop
[26:20] from warning against you
[26:22] your flesh ain't gonna stop from warning
[26:24] against you and that's why it says that
[26:26] we got to die daily
[26:27] as long as you here we go we're gonna be
[26:29] in a battle we're gonna be in a fight
[26:30] with this flesh how many believe that
[26:32] tonight
[26:33] but i like how paul here is breaking it
[26:36] down to the church he says that you know
[26:38] he says i want you to be strong in the
[26:40] lord and in the power of his
[26:42] might don't try to you know don't try to
[26:45] fight your own battles
[26:46] you try to fight your own battles then
[26:48] you'll lose remember the bible said that
[26:50] the battle
[26:51] the battle angel ain't yours but it's
[26:53] the lord's how many believe that tonight
[26:56] and that's what we learned to i was
[26:58] sharing with the
[26:59] church and sumter the other day i said
[27:01] you know once you got to learn to give
[27:03] it to god
[27:04] i says you know uh uh i had to learn
[27:07] that as an individual and still learning
[27:09] every day
[27:10] how to give things to god you know you
[27:12] feel a lot better when you learn
[27:14] how to release things to god you can
[27:16] walk around with these heavy weights and
[27:18] these
[27:19] things that clouds you down and and they
[27:21] have you in so much
[27:23] bondage that you can't do as you ought
[27:25] to for the lord
[27:26] you can't even praise god like you want
[27:28] to you can't
[27:29] function in the spirit realm like you
[27:31] want to because of these weights and
[27:33] these things that's hank
[27:34] that's that's that's holding you down
[27:36] maybe some natural affliction or
[27:38] whatever it might be it might be a
[27:40] a health affliction or whatever it might
[27:42] be nevertheless
[27:44] remember this ain't nothing dealing with
[27:46] flesh and blood but it's is spiritual
[27:47] battles
[27:48] the devil is is is doing his best to
[27:51] keep you from fulfilling the will of god
[27:53] in your life
[27:54] he'll give you all kind of uh he'll do
[27:57] all kind of things into you
[27:58] in your life that'll create or cause you
[28:01] to create excuses to why you ain't
[28:03] functioning god's program like you ought
[28:06] to he'll give you all kind of excuses
[28:09] i'm tired my body don't feel come on but
[28:11] i want to say you know
[28:13] jesus he pressed on anyhow how many
[28:16] believe that tonight
[28:18] when we look in the book of hebrews and
[28:20] many throughout all of
[28:21] scripture we got so many clouds of
[28:23] witnesses that against the grain
[28:25] against all odds they still were able to
[28:27] fulfill what god had ordained for their
[28:30] life
[28:30] because they learned how to press on how
[28:32] many believe that tonight
[28:34] so let's not have excuses to why we
[28:36] can't do what god asks us to do
[28:39] less against the grain say lord i'm
[28:40] gonna do what you asked me to do
[28:42] if i got to lose everything if i got to
[28:44] give up friendship if i got to give up
[28:46] this or that lord i'm going to do what
[28:47] you asked me to do
[28:48] because i'm here for one purpose and
[28:50] that is it's written of me god to do thy
[28:53] will
[28:53] hallelujah how many believe that tonight

[31:07] said it just contaminates the whole
[31:09] atmosphere
[31:10] the whole atmosphere just contaminated i
[31:12] said man y'all starting to rub off on me
[31:14] listening to all this complaining and
[31:16] whining
[31:17] i say the thing about it is it
[31:18] contaminates the atmosphere
[31:20] i said then when you come to work you
[31:22] can't even enjoy the shelf doing the
[31:23] things
[31:24] that you do at work because the
[31:25] atmosphere is so contaminated
[31:27] i said we got to change the atmosphere
[31:29] in here no matter what we got to find a
[31:31] way to change the atmosphere in here
[31:33] come on and everybody seem to be like
[31:36] joking around loud said that's what it
[31:38] is you know atmosphere makes a big
[31:39] difference
[31:40] come on people can be feeling bad but
[31:42] the atmosphere makes a big difference
[31:44] i believe that with all of my heart you
[31:46] people can be down but when they walk
[31:48] into the right atmosphere
[31:50] something changed with what they going
[31:52] through
[31:53] they might have had had problems but
[31:56] they forgot all about their problems
[31:58] might have had a headache forgot all
[32:00] about the headache but body hurting
[32:02] forgot all about it when they act when
[32:03] they walked into the right atmosphere
[32:05] hallelujah how many believe that tonight
[32:08] i believe that
[32:09] what i said is what it is we in the
[32:11] spiritual war come on we in the battle
[32:13] we're fighting
[32:14] we're not against flesh and blood i like
[32:17] how paul
[32:18] says here at the end of when he was
[32:21] talking about
[32:22] putting on the whole arm of god and
[32:24] talking about faith and all this i like
[32:26] how he says
[32:27] i want you to pray always come on i want
[32:29] you to always be down on your knees
[32:31] praying
[32:32] i believe that's the key to the battle
[32:34] we in how you gonna fight the enemy that
[32:36] you can't see
[32:37] how you gonna fight the enemy that a lot
[32:39] of times you don't have no knowledge
[32:41] because what's going on while we're
[32:43] while we're sitting here
[32:45] going about our daily life it's deeming
[32:48] powers
[32:49] on the outside looking in it's spiritual
[32:52] wickedness in high places
[32:54] while you laying at sleep at night
[32:56] devising a way of how i'm going to
[32:57] destroy your day when you get up in the
[32:59] morning
[33:00] or how i'm going to turn this person's
[33:02] world upside down come on
[33:03] while you're sleeping at night
[33:05] principalities powers is fighting
[33:07] against you
[33:08] they trying to infiltrate your spirit
[33:09] while you sleep when you wake up in the
[33:11] morning come on
[33:12] but what it is he said i want you to
[33:14] pray always
[33:15] hallelujah when we get down on our knees
[33:18] and pray what do we say lord i need you
[33:20] to fight this battle for me
[33:21] god i'm headed to this day i don't know
[33:23] what's ahead of me lord
[33:24] but i'm gonna put it in your hands god
[33:26] lord as i walk today lord you take hold
[33:29] of my footsteps
[33:30] as i talk today lord take hold of my
[33:32] mouth lord
[33:33] make the way for me how many believe
[33:35] that this is smart tonight
[33:37] when i say that's what it is you know
[33:39] demon powers
[33:41] you know they they in high places devise
[33:43] another way
[33:44] to destroy you devise another way to
[33:47] cause you to get out the will of god
[33:49] that they can have an accusation against
[33:51] you before god
[33:52] look at what they did look at what they
[33:54] did but i thank god for his blood
[33:56] tonight
[33:57] that when god looks at us he don't see
[34:00] those things as long as our heart is
[34:02] right hallelujah
[34:03] he looks at the blood how many believe
[34:05] that
[34:06] and i said spiritual warfare i like how
[34:09] he says praying always with prayer and
[34:12] supplication in the spirit
[34:13] and watching therefore with all
[34:15] perseverance and supplication
[34:17] for all saints and then he throws uh in
[34:19] the 19th verse
[34:20] he says and for me that utterance may be
[34:24] given unto me
[34:25] that i may open my mouth boldly i
[34:28] thought that was
[34:29] something i says that paul asked the
[34:31] people to pray for
[34:33] he says when you're praying remember me
[34:37] that i might be able to open my mouth
[34:39] boldly
[34:40] to speak to you oh i thought today how
[34:43] the ministry needs your prayer
[34:45] the man of god he needs your prayer you
[34:48] know because not only is he fighting
[34:50] the same battle you fighting but it's
[34:52] even more sometime a demon powers
[34:54] a spiritual wickedness to do what to get
[34:56] him not to open his mouth boldly
[34:58] to get him to deviate from the word of
[35:00] god here deviate
[35:02] from the word of god there then in the
[35:03] end what it is he gonna be
[35:05] have to give an account for each and
[35:07] every one soul he gonna have to give an
[35:09] account for what he said and what he
[35:10] didn't say
[35:11] come on paul said pray for me that i
[35:14] could speak
[35:14] boldly and i believe that's the prayer
[35:17] of all the ministry today that you pray
[35:18] for them
[35:19] i know that's my prayer that you pray
[35:21] for me sometimes
[35:23] as an individual might not understand
[35:25] the weight that's on the ministry
[35:27] might not understand that sometimes in
[35:30] the ministry
[35:30] you feel uh helpless sometimes because
[35:33] you're doing
[35:33] all you can do coronavirus hitting and
[35:37] you still preaching that god is a healer
[35:39] people are dying all around you but you
[35:41] still declaring that god is a healer
[35:43] you still declaring that jesus christ is
[35:45] the same
[35:46] yesterday today and forever critics are
[35:49] all over the land but yet you're still
[35:51] declaring it
[35:52] hallelujah and nevertheless i still
[35:54] don't doubt it why because i believe
[35:56] that god will back it up
[35:58] you said how that because god he keeps
[36:00] his word
[36:01] hallelujah how many believe that tonight
[36:05] but i believe that paul like he says
[36:07] here he says
[36:08] remember me come on in prayer and i pray
[36:11] that night that you remember me
[36:13] as i remember you come on why because we
[36:15] fight in a battle
[36:16] it's demon powers it's power's out there
[36:19] it says that you know
[36:21] a lot of times we could just skip on
[36:24] down i says that
[36:25] you know satan's got all kind of tactics
[36:28] that he loves to use
[36:30] and one of the tactics he like to use is
[36:32] fear
[36:33] he likes to use fear he used fear to
[36:36] you
[36:38] you use fear the bible says that he
[36:40] calls you
[36:41] the the love not fear he says the fear
[36:44] has what
[36:45] it has torment the devil will use fear
[36:48] to torment you
[36:49] he'll use fear to you he'll use
[36:52] fear to
[36:53] take your your uh a vision of faith away
[36:56] that you can't see
[36:58] uh uh through the eyes of faith but you
[37:00] would only
[37:01] be able to see the things that you could
[37:04] physically see with your natural eyes
[37:06] so sometimes we have to find a way to
[37:08] close our natural eyes
[37:10] and look through the eyes of faith god
[37:14] i'm looking past all of what i see
[37:17] and when you look past or what all you
[37:19] see and what happens
[37:21] faith draws the victory now unto you
[37:24] come on i believe that david says uh
[37:27] though i walk through the valley in the
[37:30] shadow of death
[37:31] he said i will what i will fear no evil
[37:34] come on
[37:35] though he walking through that valley in
[37:37] that shadow of death
[37:39] how can he not fear because he can't be
[37:42] looking at the valley in the shadow of
[37:44] death
[37:44] he can't be looking at the demon powers
[37:46] that's out there
[37:47] trying to boom and scare them come on
[37:50] but he's got to somewhere
[37:52] find a way to get out of himself i
[37:54] believe that and get
[37:55] into a realm of faith the way he says
[37:58] i'm walking through these places
[37:59] but i know that thou art with me come on
[38:02] thou roared and my staff it comfort me
[38:04] god i know you're here in these places
[38:07] hallelujah then you can walk through
[38:09] those valleys and those shadows of death
[38:11] when everybody else is looking at you
[38:13] and don't know what you're doing
[38:14] you know where you are you ride in the
[38:16] masters hands you know
[38:18] where you are the ship is being tossed
[38:20] the winds are blowing but you know the
[38:22] anchor holes
[38:23] how many believe that tonight hallelujah
[38:26] i said that's what it is walking through
[38:29] those valleys shadow dell he said i
[38:31] won't fear no evil
[38:32] come on one of the take satan's tactic
[38:34] is is fear
[38:36] he'll use fear to you a lot of
[38:39] times
[38:40] fear will make you say things that you
[38:42] ought not say
[38:44] fear and make you react in ways that you
[38:45] ought not react then why
[38:47] because you you fear gripped your heart
[38:50] you got scared and you
[38:51] you've done things that you shouldn't
[38:53] have done why because fear gripped your
[38:54] heart
[38:55] i believe that i says you know thinking
[38:58] about israel and how
[38:59] you know uh god had done so many great
[39:02] things for him
[39:02] but what happened uh when when the spies
[39:05] came back from the land
[39:07] ten of them had an evil report and what
[39:09] did it did that evil report contaminated
[39:12] the minds of the people contaminated the
[39:14] atmosphere got the whole atmosphere
[39:16] messed up
[39:17] because of what they said hey and the
[39:19] thing is they didn't say that they were
[39:21] uh grasshoppers in the giants eyes they
[39:24] said but we in our own sight
[39:26] in our own eyes were like grasshoppers
[39:28] in their sight come on
[39:30] they were looking at themselves and what
[39:33] it is
[39:33] it caused a fear to grip those people
[39:37] fear grip those people in such a way
[39:39] that it
[39:40] it it tormented them and handicapped
[39:42] them until they started saying all kinds
[39:44] of things
[39:45] they started saying things like moses
[39:48] why you didn't leave us in egypt to die
[39:50] come on why did you bring us all out
[39:52] here what happened fear done that
[39:55] fear the bible said they cried all night
[39:57] long
[39:58] fear tormented the people
[40:01] not realizing like joshua and caleb was
[40:04] telling them
[40:04] the land is just like god said it is
[40:06] yeah it might be giants in the land
[40:08] but look at what already god has done
[40:10] for us come on
[40:12] we are more than able then then to
[40:14] defeat the giants that's against us
[40:17] why because we didn't get here on our
[40:18] own in the first place
[40:20] it was god in the beginning and it's god
[40:22] now hallelujah and that's the way i look
[40:24] at situations
[40:26] even today i said god didn't bring me
[40:28] this far to leave me come on
[40:30] i just can't give up now he brought me
[40:33] too far
[40:33] hallelujah from where i started from
[40:36] though the giants might be in the land i
[40:38] ain't the one that brought myself here
[40:40] i ain't the one that saved myself and
[40:42] delivered myself from the light that i
[40:44] was in it was god then and it'll be god
[40:46] now hallelujah
[40:48] oh jesus mountains have gotten bigger
[40:51] hallelujah but my god is even bigger oh
[40:54] god how many believe that tonight

[41:03] time god rising to the occasion
[41:06] god is bigger than your mountain god is
[41:08] speaking in the trial you're going
[41:10] through
[41:10] god is bigger than the things you're
[41:12] facing tonight my god is so big not even
[41:15] death can conquer him hallelujah
[41:17] but he conquered death in the grave and
[41:19] he said if
[41:20] you know that same spirit that raised
[41:22] jesus from the dead
[41:23] if it dwell in you then it'll quicken
[41:25] your mortal body not even the mountain
[41:27] of death can stand before god
[41:29] how many believe that tonight if that's
[41:32] true
[41:33] then we are more than conquerors what
[41:35] can stand
[41:36] who can stand before you hallelujah
[41:38] tonight how many believe that tonight
[41:41] i said what it is fear made them do all
[41:44] those things
[41:45] you know the the ten spies like i said
[41:48] it created an image in their mind
[41:50] caused him to be in fear now i realize
[41:53] but joshua and caleb realized that
[41:55] david realized that when he had to go
[41:57] face goliath come on this wasn't a
[41:59] natural battle
[42:00] he says what the problem did what you
[42:02] did you called god out come on
[42:05] you called god out and god rose to the
[42:08] occasion didn't he
[42:09] god stepped on the scene don't you know
[42:11] the world today is calling god out
[42:13] come on they're saying where be uh uh
[42:16] the lord and

[42:53] appearing they'll see them the second
[42:55] time
[42:55] i don't know about you but i'm looking
[42:57] for his appearance i'm looking for god
[42:59] to show up
[43:00] and do what he said to you do hallelujah
[43:03] looking for god i says what it is
[43:07] you know the bible says that men's heart
[43:09] was going to fail for fear come on
[43:11] what it is the devil using that fear
[43:14] like it says you don't want you to fear
[43:15] but
[43:16] have faith a lot of times i says what
[43:18] happens a lot of times
[43:20] we fear because we don't trust god
[43:24] you have fear because you don't trust
[43:25] god you don't trust him
[43:28] you know i was thinking about the
[43:30] children of israel
[43:31] and i said that when they came to the
[43:34] land and
[43:34] all these things happening and you know
[43:37] god even
[43:38] told moses he says that this generation
[43:41] they do error
[43:42] in their ways come on they earn he says
[43:45] that
[43:45] you know at one point all that all that
[43:47] i did and i proved myself
[43:49] all these times and still yet they don't
[43:52] believe me
[43:53] still yet fear still can grip their
[43:56] heart in a way
[43:57] to where they can make statements like
[43:59] that why because
[44:01] even after all of god trying and proving
[44:04] that wasn't enough to get them to
[44:06] believe come on
[44:08] and even today sometimes it ain't enough
[44:10] to get the people to believe
[44:12] sometimes it ain't enough the the way
[44:15] you can be
[44:16] self sold out and settled to what god
[44:18] has done
[44:19] god if you don't do nothing else you
[44:21] already done enough
