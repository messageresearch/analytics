[24:21] verse if you got to say Amen
[24:23] and it reads Simon Peter a servant and
[24:26] an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[24:29] have obtained like Precious Faith with
[24:32] us through the righteousness of God and
[24:35] our Savior Jesus Christ you may be
[24:37] seated
[24:38] and read a little further down Grace and
[24:41] peace be multiplied unto you that unto
[24:44] you through the knowledge of God and of
[24:47] Jesus our lord according as his Divine
[24:50] divine power have given unto us all

[25:02] exceeding great and precious promises
[25:05] that by these you might be partakers of

[25:18] knowledge to knowledge Temperance and to
[25:21] Temperance patience and the patience
[25:22] godliness and the godliness brotherly
[25:25] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[25:27] charity for if these things be in you
[25:29] and abound they make you that ye shall
[25:32] never be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[25:35] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[25:38] he that lack of these things is blind
[25:40] and cannot seal far off and have
[25:42] forgotten that he was what was purged
[25:45] from his old sins wherefore the rather
[25:49] brother and give diligence to make your
[25:52] call and election sure for if you do
[25:54] these things ye shall never fall for our
[25:58] soul and entrance shall be ministered
[26:00] unto you abundantly and to the
[26:02] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[26:05] Savior Jesus Christ may God have bless
[26:08] the reading of his word again tonight
[26:10] just for just for a moment I want to
[26:12] minister to you and a little something
[26:14] that Lord had put on my heart and I
[26:16] ministered on it on Sunday I want to I
[26:19] want to entitle it making sure amen
[26:23] like right here when he was saying you
[26:26] know in the 10th verse he says wherefore
[26:28] the rather brother and give diligence to
[26:31] make your calling an election sure
[26:34] you know you want to in an hour that we
[26:37] live in I was thinking you know like I
[26:40] was telling someone last night you know
[26:42] on the phone or just calling me from the
[26:44] job and they were saying something was
[26:46] going wrong with one of the machines and
[26:48] all and he was saying well I think it's
[26:50] doing this and I think this might be the
[26:53] problem and I tell them that's just
[26:55] that's just a guess you know but we got
[26:58] instruments that we can hook up and you
[27:01] can check out the codes and make sure
[27:02] what the problem is other than that or
[27:04] you're just guessing you know so I was
[27:07] thinking about that I said it's a lot of
[27:08] things in life we we guess at you know
[27:10] we guess that or we can just uh Venture
[27:13] like sometimes without Authority and all
[27:15] that but you know it's some some things
[27:18] that we can't do that with because it is
[27:22] your soul at stake so you want to make
[27:24] sure certain things in life I know I
[27:27] just you know examine my own Christian
[27:29] walk and I said Lord you know you know
[27:32] sometimes you would say I can just want
[27:34] to do this I feel like doing this I feel
[27:35] like somebody say let's do this you say
[27:37] okay let's do it or you just feel you
[27:39] just do things and you just do it
[27:42] without consulting God first about it
[27:44] and that says that we all fall under
[27:46] that sometimes but I was examining
[27:48] myself you know the other day and I was
[27:51] just the other day another week and I
[27:53] said you know Lord you know I I don't
[27:55] want to in this hour right now in the
[27:57] time I don't want to be that way you
[27:59] know sometimes in the Christian Journey
[28:01] you got to feel yourself you got to
[28:03] mature from certain things you used to
[28:04] do you just can't do it no more in
[28:06] certain moves you would make without
[28:08] thinking you can't do that no more now
[28:10] you to that point you say I want to
[28:11] consult God on all things no matter what
[28:14] it might seem like this is small or
[28:16] whatever but you know seeking God you
[28:19] know first and then you you feel more
[28:22] comfortable then in that knowing that
[28:24] you sought the Lord but when you just
[28:26] out there you don't know you just out
[28:28] there you just made a move made a
[28:29] decision did did something without
[28:31] consulting the Lord first then you you
[28:33] know you just at the mercy of God then
[28:35] but just thinking about that says you
[28:37] know calling you know you want to make
[28:39] these things uh uh you're calling on
[28:41] your election and sure I was you know
[28:43] just meditating I said you know
[28:45] everything in this life ain't promised
[28:47] you know a lot of things we have goals
[28:49] dreams and all those things and this is
[28:51] good but all of it ain't all of this
[28:52] stuff ain't promised the only one thing
[28:54] that's promised and that's one day
[28:56] you're gonna have to meet the Lord one
[28:57] day but when you meet them you want to
[29:00] meet them with a clear conscience that
[29:02] Lord I did the best you know I can do I
[29:04] was looking at some things and I guess I
[29:07] won't be real long tonight if I was
[29:08] looking at some things in the scriptures
[29:10] and how you know it kind of humbled me a
[29:13] little bit looking at Solomon life and
[29:15] how you know after his father David was
[29:18] gone and he had such everybody had such
[29:20] great expectations of them you know to
[29:23] build a house of the Lord and David's
[29:25] son he won't exceed his father strong
[29:27] and all that but you know God came to
[29:31] him and it just kind of humbled me God
[29:33] came to him and talking to him in a
[29:35] dream I was like what will I give you
[29:37] you know out of these things and and
[29:39] that Solomon's reply was Lord he says
[29:42] Lord you know just paraphrasing I'm a
[29:44] child you know I don't know how to go in
[29:46] and come out
[29:47] people got great expectations of me I
[29:50] got a lot of things that that that's a
[29:52] fun to me I got a lot of things I'm in
[29:54] control of I got a lot of things I'm
[29:55] responsible for I'm just a child I don't
[29:57] even know how to go in I don't know how
[29:59] to conduct myself I don't even know what
[30:01] to do with all this responsibility but
[30:04] his thing was Lord I need your help just
[30:08] in a in a in a paraphrase way Lord I
[30:10] need your help God if you would help me
[30:13] to govern your people I just wanted
[30:15] whatever I just Lord help me that I can
[30:18] walk you know in your ways I can do the
[30:21] Judgment right to help me that's what I
[30:22] want Lord and you know God it pleased
[30:25] the Lord that that's what he asked for
[30:26] but I don't think you know and he said
[30:28] since you asked for that I'm gonna give
[30:30] you all these other things but Solomon
[30:32] didn't I can't I wouldn't say he foresaw
[30:34] that coming but in his heart that's what
[30:36] he wanted in his heart
[30:38] that kind of you know just meditating on
[30:41] it just kind of humbled you I says Lord
[30:43] you know in in all things you know you
[30:47] can be
[30:48] a lot of times I was talking with
[30:50] Charlotte last night it was discussing
[30:52] some things and about the ministry I
[30:54] said you know even in the ministry a lot
[30:56] of times you know people they they
[30:59] covered these things want to be in the
[31:01] ministry because popularity or because
[31:03] out in the Forefront but it's a lot of
[31:05] things come with that and not only just
[31:08] in the ministry but was talking about
[31:10] pastoring from one and you know it's
[31:13] talking about certain situations and I
[31:15] said you know it that's the thing a
[31:17] pastor might look good from the out
[31:19] front you know Forefront because look
[31:21] like they got a church and they Thrive
[31:23] and they out the Forefront they some
[31:25] great preacher but it's crisis is Gonna
[31:28] Come
[31:29] it's hard times gonna come it's hard man
[31:32] Charlotte was talking about this last
[31:34] night it's some hard situations gonna
[31:36] come not only with you but with you with
[31:38] the members of the church and the other
[31:40] one this situation is going to come it's
[31:42] going to seem to be unbearable then
[31:44] you're going to want to know that your
[31:46] you made your call in an election sure
[31:48] you're gonna want to know that you know
[31:50] in that time I think the prophet of God
[31:52] is looking at something he's saying that
[31:53] somebody was wanting to know was they
[31:55] called or not he was saying you know you
[31:57] want to make sure that because if you
[31:58] don't the devil's gonna tear you up
[32:01] the devil going and it's going to be
[32:03] more than what you can stand he said
[32:05] because but but if God called you then
[32:07] he'll give you you won't be able to to
[32:10] uh get away from it you know it's a part
[32:13] of you because that's your calling it'll
[32:15] be it'll be like say it made easy for
[32:17] you but nevertheless you'll have weapons
[32:19] to fight with because that's the calling
[32:21] that God put you in you know so we look
[32:23] at I was me and Charlotte are just
[32:25] discussing this for a while not saying
[32:27] you know it's some things I said even
[32:29] even in the ministry it's like you know
[32:32] uh your children the devil want to
[32:35] attack your children he gonna attack the
[32:37] preacher children more than anybody else
[32:39] to tear the ministry down you look at
[32:42] the children say hey because everybody
[32:44] didn't know what the devil does you get
[32:46] the people look at your children oh they
[32:47] children and they chill that's what
[32:49] that's the enemy that's what the devil
[32:50] does so all of this comes it in the
[32:53] package you know but a lot of times as
[32:56] as men we seek popularity sometimes we
[32:59] seek out to we take out the things and
[33:02] nobody wants the back seat nobody wants
[33:04] to be that unknown person that person
[33:07] that you know nobody but the thing about
[33:09] it is those are the things that God get
[33:12] Glory out of the little the the little
[33:15] unspoken about brother or sister you
[33:18] know God recognizes that person God has
[33:21] respect unto that person now it's a way
[33:24] you can you can try to manufacture that
[33:27] but no as as a person as me and
[33:29] Charlotte I was talking last night you
[33:31] don't want a manufacture not you can
[33:33] only be what God made you to be
[33:37] you know this house of God you know that
[33:40] he we're building a house of God but
[33:42] he's fitly framed us together you cut
[33:44] out you got to place that God gonna put
[33:46] you in you can't fit in no other place
[33:48] but that you might desire wish that you
[33:51] could fit here or wish that you could do
[33:52] that but that that ain't your lot you
[33:54] got to find out Lord what's your life
[33:56] for my life
[33:58] because that's what God you know
[34:00] whatever you claim to be you know
[34:02] whether you that or not God gonna judge
[34:04] you by it
[34:05] and that's and that's the dangerous part
[34:07] I said God don't let me be like Paul
[34:10] like Paul Peter saying you know to make
[34:13] your call an election sure but he also
[34:15] be given giving out virtues giving out
[34:17] uh a Christian we call them a great
[34:21] Christian virtues giving out things uh
[34:23] guidelines that if you live by these
[34:26] things if you have these things he says
[34:28] you'll never fall
[34:30] he says but these things will grant you
[34:32] Insurance into the into the kingdom of
[34:35] God into the presence of God these
[34:36] things will grant you interest if you
[34:38] have them it says now you know you know
[34:40] we we can go around the line he talk
[34:42] about faith then he's going on The
[34:43] Virtue and all these things but in in
[34:46] these these things that that they aren't
[34:48] just I would say you you don't just say
[34:51] I'm gonna get this I'm gonna get that
[34:53] but it's it's what God brings you
[34:55] through to that thing to those things
[34:58] Trials of life you look at bring you
[35:00] through to that Trials of you know in
[35:03] order for you to have faith it's got to
[35:05] be some situations that's impossible
[35:07] before you
[35:08] you know he said I got faith because
[35:10] everything is accessible moving no what
[35:12] brings about real Faith you you beat a
[35:15] challenge that that all hope is gone
[35:18] real Faith you meet a challenge a
[35:21] situation where it is no hope for you
[35:23] there's no hope for that situation
[35:24] that's the impossible situation then
[35:26] what what happened then then you find
[35:28] out what faith is all about you find out
[35:31] that Faith works with nothing Faith
[35:33] looks at those situations then you but
[35:35] what it is God brings you to that and
[35:38] he's and he builds you like to say
[35:40] looking at you know then the Capstone
[35:41] off you know just to jump around going
[35:43] to love all they're saying the Cap's
[35:45] going off look at people looking at that
[35:47] but these aren't things you know when
[35:49] you look at these virtues and these
[35:51] things you can't manufacture these
[35:53] things you can't put them all on all
[35:56] that you know like that and it'd be
[35:57] genuine and it'd be real you can't the
[36:00] winds are blowing it'll test it'll knock
[36:02] you out it will but what what happens is
[36:05] I'm learning by the grace of God through
[36:09] trials and life and situation in life
[36:11] God shape you to those things you look
[36:14] at Great Heroes of Faith great people
[36:16] great uh Ministries all the time you
[36:19] look at that and you you covered those
[36:21] things but you know to get those things
[36:23] without going through the character you
[36:25] know like say power out characters
[36:27] satanic they get to those things but
[36:29] what brings about you don't see the you
[36:32] don't see the the winds you don't see
[36:34] the like we're saying even when it comes
[36:36] down to pastoring you don't see the the
[36:39] the the crisis they coming
[36:42] hard situation and you can't run from
[36:44] them
[36:45] you can't say I don't want to be a
[36:47] pastor now I don't want to be a minister
[36:48] now you can't run because they came I
[36:51] mean what it is but God built you for
[36:53] that situation right he get you gift it
[36:56] for that situation then it's going to
[36:58] show then or not you know but you say uh
[37:01] oh cause they coming oh Hallelujah I was
[37:04] talking to Charlotte last night we were
[37:06] just talking you know just openly at
[37:08] home and just looking at saying that's
[37:09] why you always pray and say Lord no
[37:11] matter what
[37:13] no matter what I want to be in your will
[37:17] if I never my name is never called lord
[37:20] I'll buy out of me and Lord I just want
[37:22] to be pleasing in your sight
[37:24] amen if you only call me for one battle
[37:25] Lord help me to be ready when that
[37:27] battle comes
[37:29] and all at all costs God I want to make
[37:31] my I want to make it sure my calling and
[37:33] election sure you know one thing Peter
[37:36] saying here that it kind of
[37:38] jumped out about at me he says uh
[37:42] here in the in the
[37:45] in the third verse according to
[37:48] according as his divine power hath given
[37:51] unto us all things that pertain unto
[37:53] life and godliness through the knowledge
[37:54] of him that call us the glory and virtue
[37:57] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[38:00] great and precious promises that by
[38:03] these things you might be partakers of
[38:06] the divine nature see I I was saying you
[38:09] know one thing about it is everything
[38:11] that we everything that we're we're
[38:14] embarking upon we realize
[38:17] that is only the grace of God
[38:19] that he's blessed us
[38:22] you know because by Nature we were the
[38:24] children of Wrath the only way we can
[38:27] have the certain spirit that we have or
[38:29] certain uh wisdom or order fellowship
[38:32] with him it's because he has given us
[38:35] blessed us that we can be partakers of
[38:38] his divine nature
[38:40] God you know you think about Peter
[38:42] talking saying this he was a man like
[38:44] you talk about ignorant and unlearning
[38:46] or fisherman curse and swear he didn't
[38:47] know him but by the grace of God
[38:49] somewhere along the line God was going
[38:52] to give him Grace to be a partaker
[38:54] of that divine nature and I thank God
[38:57] that that nature you can look back at
[38:59] that that old nature that old man and
[39:01] say Hey you know it it it it it'll hurt
[39:05] it it bothers you not even think about
[39:07] you could you would even think a certain
[39:08] way or act a certain way at one point in
[39:11] your life but you think you think that
[39:14] because what it is now God has did
[39:16] something in you
[39:18] God has God has changed you in such a
[39:21] way it's not it's not that old nature
[39:23] you took put out the old man you put on
[39:25] the new man is Christ in you now and
[39:28] that's why those things they conflict
[39:30] with the spirit of God you can't even
[39:33] and that's why you hear people even say
[39:35] they've been born again are they uh uh
[39:38] Holy Ghost Field but yet they can still
[39:40] have certain things in their nature in
[39:41] their spirit and be all right with them
[39:44] it it doesn't work like that because
[39:46] when the new nature comes it that old
[39:49] man is put away with those very things
[39:51] that that you could Feast on at one
[39:54] point in your life you can't do it no
[39:55] more
[39:56] you can't even imagine yourself doing
[39:58] that right why because the new man it's
[40:02] a new nature it's a different you can't
[40:04] even see yourself Envision you see might
[40:06] see old pictures and stuff and it make
[40:08] you feel bad but because of what it is
[40:11] you look at those things and you say hey
[40:13] but then you can remember how uh in the
[40:16] book of Ephesians it says that we at all
[40:18] at one point walked that way right in
[40:21] times past but God who was rich in Mercy
[40:24] well with the way he loved us
[40:26] then you look back at those things you
[40:28] know at one point uh especially early in
[40:30] the Christian journey I used to be uh a
[40:33] little ashamed of my my life the way I
[40:36] used to live and all those things I used
[40:37] to feel bad all the time but then I I
[40:40] realized uh at some point that that's my
[40:44] testimony
[40:45] that's that's how I can test I can
[40:48] testify I can look back and I can always
[40:49] be thankful for the grace of God that
[40:52] say that's what I was but look at what
[40:54] he has made me not that I changed myself
[40:57] but when I couldn't change myself look
[40:59] at what he has done
[41:01] I had I had to look the calvary it's not
[41:04] what I could do for myself but I had to
[41:06] realize one day he had already done the
[41:08] work for me and who the son has set free
[41:10] he is free indeed so the devil couldn't
[41:13] hold those things on my mind help me on
[41:15] that guilt trip now I can praise God and
[41:17] testify that I once was bound but now
[41:20] I'm free Hallelujah I once was was lost
[41:23] but now I'm found I can testify now
[41:25] right but what it is but God is God is
[41:28] uh uh brought us into those things that
[41:31] make us like it says to be partakers of
[41:33] his divine nature and I like this I said
[41:36] I won't be long haven't escaped the
[41:38] corruption that is in the world through
[41:41] us you know I was meditating on that I
[41:43] said we escape the corruption that is in
[41:46] the world
[41:47] you know we skate we made free from it
[41:50] you know those things had us didn't they
[41:53] bound on your way to hell but you escape
[41:56] he said we had we've been made practice
[41:58] takers of as a divine nature he said
[42:00] well we have escaped the corruption
[42:03] through of the world through lust you
[42:05] know all those things you look at what
[42:07] what is a lot of the corruption in the
[42:09] filth in the world today it's from it's
[42:11] because of lust right people lusting
[42:14] they want more they want this they lost
[42:15] and less than lusting right
[42:17] so it brings them into corruption brings
[42:20] them into those things but Christ has
[42:23] given us an escape
[42:25] we've we're we're one of the Escape ones
[42:28] that have was able to escape those
[42:30] things though that lust that'll drag you
[42:32] into that corruption we we've escaped
[42:35] that now it's not lust but it's love
[42:37] Hallelujah the love of Christ that shed
[42:40] abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Ghost
[42:42] that's what it is and I say is that you
[42:44] know we find that so I said you know
[42:46] what in this life as we we kind of
[42:49] reiterate on it in this life Everything
[42:51] is Everything is a promise it's only one
[42:53] thing that is for certain you know and
[42:55] even death somebody somebody said death
[42:57] you're going to die but not if you go
[42:59] into rapture
[43:01] so everything ain't promised but one
[43:03] thing you'll meet God one day right but
[43:05] I said just thinking about that he says
[43:07] making your call an election sure that's
[43:10] one thing right make your call on
[43:13] Election sure
[43:14] no matter what it is you might not want
[43:16] to you might pull away from it but God I
[43:19] wanna I want whatever your will is
[43:21] that's what I want everybody can be
[43:24] telling me what I should be doing or
[43:25] what I should be at but God I want what
[43:27] your will is I I'll be all right then
[43:30] come on
[43:31] I'll be all right whatever God's will is
[43:33] that's what I want I saw that's all I
[43:36] want Lord what is what is your will I
[43:38] thought about that if you get a chance
[43:40] read that in First Kings sometimes and
[43:42] Solomon it just kind of it just kind of
[43:44] humbled me down and he said Lord I'm a
[43:46] child I don't know how to go in and come
[43:48] out and I begin to think about that and
[43:50] I begin to pray and I said Lord I don't
[43:52] know how to go in and come out I don't
[43:54] know how to minister to your people I
[43:55] don't even know how to raise these
[43:56] children I don't know how to be a
[43:57] husband I don't know how come on you
[44:00] might think you know how sometimes but
[44:01] what it is God got to teach you God got
[44:03] to show you he got to show you yourself
[44:06] everybody else sometimes we look at and
[44:08] point and want to want to correct
[44:10] everybody else but say Lord I don't know
[44:12] how God I need to be perfect you know
[44:15] he's here talking about the Statue of a
[44:17] perfect man you know from every wit God
[44:20] you do these things you'll never fall
[44:21] God I want to be perfect in your sight
[44:23] but God you got to help me I want you to
[44:25] help me
[44:26] and that's been my prayer you know last
[44:29] last week or so and even these last
[44:30] couple days said Lord I need your help I
[44:33] don't know how to go in I don't know how
[44:34] to come out honestly you know sometimes
[44:37] say that but honestly Lord I don't know
[44:39] how
[44:40] I don't know how but I know I need your
[44:42] help amen
[44:46] [Applause]
[45:07] praise God
[45:08] I said we had so many people Miss that's
[45:10] super super duper short
[45:13] well we thank God for
[45:16] amen
[45:18] him being
[45:21] making sure make your call to the
[45:23] election sure
[45:25] we must be certain that the prophet said
[45:28] you must be certain of God
[45:30] certain that you know him certain that
[45:33] for his will for your life
[45:36] the Bible said
[45:38] know what the hope of your calling
[45:41] make your call in an election sure
[45:45] so you must be sure you must be certain
[45:48] you cannot amen
[45:51] be
[45:54] what he says
[45:56] let me say hi
[46:01] sometimes we're trying to
[46:04] do something
[46:06] that somebody else did
[46:08] covers another man's gift
[46:12] that we can see somebody else he said
[46:13] well I can
[46:15] you know I can do that better
[46:18] but we got to Humble ourselves and see
[46:20] what God maybe you can maybe you can do
[46:25] it super
[46:27] but is that your calling
[46:30] it doesn't make a difference if you can
[46:32] do it better
[46:34] but it's your calling
[46:36] oh yeah I can do it yes
[46:39] but Lord is that my calling
[46:42] we need to know what the hope of our
[46:44] calling is not that I could do it you
[46:48] can do a lot of things
[46:49] but Lord is that your will for me to do
[46:53] this
[46:56] see because that's what we want the will
[46:59] of the Lord Jesus said not my will but
[47:03] let your will so when it's God's will
[47:06] I'm gonna tell you something
[47:09] the flesh don't want to do it
[47:12] if your flesh want to do it it ain't
[47:14] God's will
[47:17] because your flesh don't want to do it
[47:20] and you feel that you're insufficient
[47:26] you feel like you can't get you can't do
[47:28] the job you can't do it but when you
[47:31] feel like you can do it
[47:33] that means it shows the mere fact that
[47:36] that ain't what that is not for you
[47:41] because God want to use
[47:44] he waited to uh getting and got down to
[47:47] the 300.
[47:49] because he didn't want Gideon to get the
[47:51] victory
[47:52] you think it was him doing it
[47:55] and God took Moses when he was young
[47:57] when he got 80 years old and sent him
[48:00] when he was weak
[48:03] because God was going to be the one to
[48:05] get the glory and going to do the job
[48:10] and that's what God does with us
[48:13] God takes those things he said
[48:16] rejected in those things that his spies
[48:19] and those things
[48:21] and that are at least esteem in God Amen
[48:27] he makes the wisdom of the world foolish
[48:32] and God takes those ones that are down
[48:34] and he exalts the humble
[48:38] and he takes the proud and those that
[48:40] are up
[48:43] it makes it come to naught
[48:45] are you with me
[48:47] so when are you making our calling an
[48:49] election sure
[48:51] amen
[48:53] we need to really examine ourselves
[48:57] and see where we stand in Lord am I in
[49:01] the straight narrow
[49:04] see it's got to be straight and got to
[49:06] be narrow
[49:09] the prophet chose the hard way
[49:12] he saw what
[49:14] you know Billy Graham or arrivals and
[49:16] all these great preachers had all the
[49:19] money and all the fame and all the glory
[49:22] but he chose the straight narrow way
[49:25] because you chose the hard way
[49:28] you see the Lord said that's my way
[49:31] that's where a great potion of Heaven
[49:36] got it for you amen
[49:38] you won't get it on this side but you
[49:40] get it on the other side
[49:42] are you
[49:44] but if we try to get what we can get
[49:46] here now you see how folks doing and get
[49:49] get get get now
[49:51] amen
[49:53] but you got to make sure you're getting
[49:55] now
[49:58] see oftentimes still God gives you Grace
[50:03] he gives you blessings
[50:06] it's not that you are worthy of it or
[50:09] not that you can attain the job that you
[50:10] have the house you live in the money the
[50:13] car that you drive everything you got
[50:15] God gave it to you
[50:17] you don't well I work hard
[50:21] God give you strength to work
[50:24] as a lot of people work harder than you
[50:26] it still ain't got what you got
[50:30] are you with me
[50:32] but it's the grace of God that we have
[50:34] what we have and we give all the thanks
[50:36] and glory to God
[50:38] it's not our ability it's him
[50:41] is not what we've achieved or what we
[50:44] have attained or I studied hard and I
[50:46] did this no God by the grace of God God
[50:49] I give you all the glory
[50:52] amen
[50:53] because our works not our works he said
[50:57] least what
[50:58] any man should boast
[51:01] but he said we are his workmanship
[51:04] created in Christ Jesus it is him that
[51:07] work his
[51:08] in US
[51:10] both the will and the Dew
[51:12] of his good pleasure are you with me
[51:15] so it's God that's doing the work
[51:19] amen it's not you that can do it
[51:22] but it's God that does the work
[51:25] amen you're blessed because God said I
[51:29] will bless you
[51:31] amen
[51:33] I amen I will bless you and I multiply
[51:36] told Abraham a blessing I'm gonna bless
[51:39] you
[51:40] into your seed I'm gonna bless you
[51:43] and where Abraham see by faith
[51:46] are you with me
[51:49] and God you're blessed because God grace
[51:53] is upon your life
[51:55] amen nothing that we have achieved
[51:58] nothing that we can't ever do
[52:00] it's just the mercy and grace of God
[52:03] so he says work out your Soul's
[52:05] salvation
[52:06] work it out with fear and what
[52:08] and trim to work it out amen
[52:11] praise God we'd work because amen
[52:16] Hallelujah the grace of God is working
[52:19] in US
[52:21] but it's not us that work and it's him
[52:23] that's in us doing the work
[52:25] Jesus said it's not me that's doing this
[52:28] healing of Miracles it's my father
[52:31] do the word
[52:33] amen that's why I'm doing it amen that's
[52:35] why I'm walking like I'm walking that's
[52:37] why I'm living like it's because of
[52:39] something inside me
[52:41] not one that's inside you keeping you
