lord we thank you in jesus christ's name we pray amen god is good amen we want to look at the book of joshua about god's grace joshua 1. god is good amen joshua 1 and we'll begin at the first verse very familiar still was here in the book of joshua i know my brother caleb i mean i said from last week but we still was here in the same place by the grace of god joshua 1 and 1. if you got it say amen and it reads now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now now therefore arise and go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even until the great river the river euphrates and all the and all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there should not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor for safety be strong and of good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance to the land in which i swear until their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observed to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper which so ever thou goest this book of the laws shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night and thou and that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then doubt shall have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whatsoever thou goest may god bless the reading of his word may be seated tonight just for a moment i want to minister to you on something and i entitled it as i was so shall i be amen as i was so shall i be you know we here we're living in hours we were sharing you know the last week or so that you know one thing we got to remember that we're not serving a historical god but we're serving a a living god a god that as he was so he is now so a lot of times like i was sharing with the the people the other sunday i said you know you can try to you know get painted i mean get on warm by painted fire it won't do you no good you can see the fire but you can't it won't it's not giving giving off no heat generating is just a it's just a picture of something to you come on like a like that but nevertheless and i said so when we think about god we we don't we don't look at him as just what he has done and what he was capable of and it's not like he say he was capable of this but he's old now he can't do that or he used to could do this but he can't do that no more that's not the god that we serve but the god that we serve and it's not that so much as saying that we're looking that he's going to do these things in the future which we know that he will but we can't miss what he's doing right now you know the jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new testament and so we says that you know we ain't serving a historical god and we got to get away from that i was sharing with my son moses last night we were just talking and i said you know we was talking about the holy ghost and i asked him how am i going to talk to him about the holy ghost and i said the holy ghost is you know is jesus christ the person living in you i said the same things he done while he walked the face of the earth he says a little while and i'll go away he said but i won't leave you comfortless but i'm gonna send you a comforter which is the holy ghost and when he come in my name come on he is not that he says i'll no longer be with you but i'm gonna be in you i said so the same things that we saw you know in the in in the flesh of jesus christ you know that was just a body god veiled in human flesh i says but that's what it is when the holy ghost comes in you i said you'll know something happened it's not just a feeling say i felt good but you'll know that he has come you'll know that a change has taken place and i said that's what you you strive for not just for a shower or feeling i felt this anointing many felt this anointing but they can't produce the life many felt this presence but they can't live nothing they might walk for a long time but yet they can't walk right come on they can meditate read the bible day in and out but until the word gets in you until the word comes in your heart come on and he causes you to walk in his statues then it ain't going to do you no good come on so i began to talk when i'm like that last night and i could feel god's presence because it's real because when you talking about it as i was sharing with them i said what it is it'll be that inner voice come on i says wherever you go he'll be with you you might sometimes say you don't you don't you might not say i don't feel him like that but he's there come on he's with you that inner voice is going to speak to you it's going he gonna he gonna lead and guide you i said it's not that you know i was sharing i said the thing is i says you don't want to do nothing to hurt you how would you want to do something to hurt your mom and dad you do things and you sometimes you think about how would that make my mom and dad feel if they know i've done it because you respect him you don't want to hurt your mom and dad and i says but you know christ i mean god he is our father so when we conduct ourselves you know what the holy ghost teaches us you don't want to do nothing that'll hurt god you always want to walk according to what what he wants you to walk so what we do we begin to ask god we say god you know me nobody else don't know you like god know you you realize that god knows you god knows things about you that you don't even know about yourself you might feel as lord i'll go all the way with you but god know he says come on he says this night before the cockroach uh thrice he says you'll deny even knowing me but i know you intend to do good but you don't you don't have what it takes to go all the way but after you convert it then you strengthen your brothers come on so it's not just a mythical thing but it's the real it's the deity it's him it's christ himself come on the hope of glory coming and living in you then you know then that the struggle is over it's not that i'm i'm worried about oh i might fail god i might go back the struggle is over because he's here now and he's in control he's got in the ship he's leading and guiding so i'm not worried about those things what it is because i know that in the hour when i need him he'll show up how many believe that i really believe that because it's true it happens all the time and i said you know it's something the prophet of god was saying and it kind of stirred in my heart he was saying that you know jesus he defeated satan and all of his and all of his power with the written word of god come on he defeated satan in all his power with the written word of god first real battle conflict that he came in while on this earth with satan what how did he defeat defeat him with the written word of god because what's written in the book that's that can stand the bible says heaven and earth will pass away didn't say that but my word will not pass away right that's how powerful the word of god is atomic explosion things will blow this world up but the word of god is still stand the word of god is still staying true if he said i'll bring it forth he gonna bring it forth no matter what uh a circumstance or situation is holding on you come on you know it was said that the god he can defeat the devil on any place at any time and under any circumstances there ain't nothing too hard for the lord how many believe that tonight i believe that with all of my heart so we find that i says you know so we we know that we're not serving a a historical god but we're serving a real god a god a living and so i'm i'm stirred because i want to see him as he was i want to see him you know i can see here a great salutation that that joshua god come to joshua and begin to speak to him he says he says moses my servant is dead now come on a lot of times you know we do depend on as just just being a in the flesh sometimes you do look up to great men and how god use mighty men and all and sometimes we look to them and and for dependence we look to them for leadership sometimes just being in the flesh but nevertheless you know it ain't the man but it's what what's veiled behind the man's skin come on it's not that we look at the man but we we we're we're not really seeing the works of the man we're seeing the works of god in the man come on and that's what the man of god i believe that when he ministers the gospel what does he want to do leads you to a living god i want to show you that he says the words that i do you will do also he said in my name you'll cast out devils he said these signs shall follow them that believe not just the preachers not just the prophets he said but to them that believe these signs will follow them in my name come on call on his name he said in my name you'll cast out devils you'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said these sounds he said to to them that believe so what it is you want them to see that come on it's god himself he's among you he's living in you he's veiled not only behind the preacher but he's railing you and you as an individual do you believe that so we come to that place that i believe that like i said we look at great men and that's a sometimes a stumbling block because when god moved that man off the scene sometimes people feel like well what are we going to do because the great man now has been moved off of the scene they still look for that great man but i love how how god come to encourage joshua first thing he told him moses my servant is dead now come on he going on he says but as i was with him so i'm gonna be with you the same way as i was i'm still here and i'm still the same guard so he's dead he's gone on i want you to remember what he told you now he said i want you to remember that but don't look to him you look to me now come on and that's what it is come on i says we ought to look to jesus look look into the altar and the finisher of our faith jesus started me on the journey and jesus helped me finish the journey come on what it is if you got saved because you followed a man then that's wrong it's messed up from the beginning but if something one day pricked your heart and said that when their hearts were pricked they said me and the brother what shall we do why because their hearts would pray something gotta hold to them and let them know that i need a savior they started right come on and when they start it right god can help him lead find the rest of the way how many believe that so we find like i said he give him that salutation as we said as i was so shall i be so talking to joshua that way come on and you can see joshua i could see that salutation maybe they go back in their minds of how mighty uh how god used moses like never before how god used moses in a way that he never done he spoke the most in a way like he never done ever in history at that time come on he says he says if a man think he's spiritual he says i'll speak to him a dream and so forth things like that he said but not so with moses he said i speak to him like a man speak to his friend face to face come on so but they i could see he says as i was with him that's how i'm gonna be with you i'm gonna be that same god so no doubt you know the children of israel can when they go on to face their enemies they hadn't they could have no other choice but to go back in their minds and see what god was and know that hey we got a battle now we got to fight but god you promised us that the way you was you're gonna be that same right now so when we go out we're depending on you to be the same just like you said you was now come on you said you'll be with us that same way and we depending on it come on and that's what i say even even here tonight what are we depending on the more the more wicked the hour get and the more you see the yourself uh encamped about all these dark clouds and witnesses that's the more that i don't know about you but i'm starting to learn to let go more and say lord come on we can't fight all these devils it's too many demons to fight how we gonna fight them on our own the ability can't be in us i said god it's gonna take you lord god i'm dependent on you to see us true how many believe that that's what it is the more you see it an environ around us say hey our enemies is encamped all around us now we're seeing these things but god you promised you said that we're overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of our testimony come on you said that you're the high priest of our of our confession come on you plead in our case before the throne how many believe that tonight so as we stand here i said god uh uh lord i'm confessing that you're the same yesterday today and forever i'm confessing you're still a healer i'm confessing you're still a provider i'm a profession i'm just going to confess my way through all this darkness i'm going to confess my way through all these trials i'm going to confess my way because he's my high priest i'm gonna confess my way through all these things he's waiting he said they overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony come on i was saying talking about that little song the other day uh it says that i know that i can make it come on i know that i can stand no matter what comes my way my life is in his hands come on no matter what you faced with throughout the day i know i'll make it come on i know i ain't got no other choice but to stand when i don't know what to do i ain't got no other choice but to stand hallelujah i'ma wait on guard how many want to wait on him tonight but he says as i was as i was with him so as we said no doubt he had they had no other choice but to go back in their minds and see you know the victories that was one it's good when you can look back at testimonies it's good when you can look back at a real god the problem sometimes be that people never seen god in action they never seen a living guard so they have nothing they can reach back to come on but nevertheless that that shouldn't still stop you because god want he want to be that living god he want to give you those trophies that's why sometimes he let circumstances and uh situations arise so he can show you that hey i'm that mighty guard i'm that deliverer i'm that so we take those things and strive and we look at that says one thing about it as i like how he began to tell joshua uh as he's as beginning to speak to him set out as i was at moses so i'll be with thee he began to speak to him he says i won't fail you come on he said i won't fail you you might fail god but he won't fail you he said you just think about that he said i will not fail you come on in all of your struggling and all of your trials and all of your tribulations he said i will not fail you [Music] he said i won't fail you nor will i forsake you but i'll be with you so wheresoever you go come on he says i've given you the land wherever your feet touch you know this is god speaking to joshua wherever you go you tread upon i'm giving it to you i'm gonna be with you as i was with moses come on i'm gonna be with you i ain't gonna fail you nor forsake you so what it is as i was i was sharing you know me and the kids children were reading how rahab uh uh began to tell the spies you know in a couple chapters away rahab began to tell the spies she says the whole whole everybody know y'all coming come on she said and everybody hearts are trembling and are afraid said their heart is melded because they know that your god has given you the city come on and i say it's what it is that's what the the the you know what the difference between joshua and him and the rest of those armies the rest of those armies might have been more in number but the difference was the supernatural they had the supernatural working among them that's what it is they might have been small in number but they heard how the seeds dried up for your sake they heard of how you destroyed the other kings in the valley they heard what you done to them and all the hearts began to melt then because they heard how god was moving among you and i said that's what it is today demons tremble at that name of jesus don't they come on demons tremble at a church that's got the supernatural among them now a church that's just coming and just gathering just having a good time nobody's living the life nobody's doing right they just living any kind of way and preaching come on the devil ain't afraid of that he might even come to church with you come on but the only thing about it when the supernatural is among them that's what makes a difference how many believe that come on if they were just carrying the ark and just bragging on their guard but no signs and wonders the other cities wouldn't have been afraid but when they see that art coming come on that ark was their glory hallelujah and when they walked in the waters and the waters opening up all the inhabitants of the land melted because of him and i said all today what do we need we need a church that's walking in power church that's walking in authority a church that demons are befrayed come on you know sickness is on people's life when they walk in the door what happened they be healed because of the supernatural hallelujah how many believe that demons can't come in your home why because of the supernatural that's what makes the difference and i said god that's what i want in my life in my home god not just just to be stirred i heard a good sermon but let the difference be the supernatural let the difference be the cloud hallelujah by day in the fire by night let that be the difference how many want that tonight well we find that come on he she said everybody know they're afraid of you ain't it because god god gave you the city they heard of what your god is doing they heard of how he brought you up and he and i and a little further on down they says that you know one day one of the enemies come to make a pact with them come on disguise themselves and made a pact and joshua don't say hey why did y'all do it that way why y'all deceive us he said because we heard what what what uh yo god's servant moses your god servant moses commanded you that when you come in the land destroy all the happiness inhabitants of the land don't leave we heard we heard what what you were told destroy them and we was afraid for our lives come on but what it is i says you know god is real he's the same god come on yesterday today and forever but one thing you know one thing that all god asked for was obedience ain't it that's all he asked for he says now i want you to take that that word meditate in it day and night the book of the law he said i want you to be obedient so he says and if you walk in it come on and he gave them certain instructions as i was preaching on sunday the curse thing he gave them certain instructions when you go in the city come on the city is yours but there's certain things i don't want you to touch i want you to destroy because you bring it in it's going to be an occurs to you come on and we know what happened how i think it was in joshua chapter six you know how god was blessing them they were he as he was he was being come on going and giving them the land and all but you had one one person come on saul the the the babylonians garmin the silver and the spoil come on god blessing you all you got to do he said wherever you go i'm going to be with you i'ma get i don't give you the land why why you still got to covet those things why you still want to curse things come on but you know it got in my spirit how you know god began to tell joshua he when when they went out the ai because remember like i said you know they might have been smaller numbers but the difference was the supernatural but after when they went up the ai you know they went up to spy out the land began to say hey this it ain't but a few all of us don't need to go up this ain't nothing but a little test come on we can surely take take this city after all the great victories we don't won all the mountains we don't climb all the kings we don't destroy all the devils we don't fault right now surely this little test ain't nothing but the only difference was the glory was gone the only difference now come on is that the supernatural wasn't among them so when they went up they uh and they they fled the bible says their backs turned come on to the enemies fleeing running now from the enemy so joshua i can see him crying out to the lord lord you promise that you'll be with us what's wrong now lord come on and god began to tell joshua he says you know you need to get up he says i'm still not saying god he said but you got sin in the camp he said not only have israel touched the curse thing but they brought it in amongst their own stuff and he says until you deal with it hallelujah until you get it out he said i'll no longer be with you you'll flee before all your enemies didn't he say that until you deal with it hallelujah so sometimes i say we got to deal with situations come on you say god why is the well stopped up why is my blessings not flowing like they ought to be come on whoa is that a curse thing among you and it's something he says not only did they touch it but they brought it amongst their own stuff come on and i said that's always been a failure of the church come on always wanting to be like the world what the world do can do we can do too oh we can just get so close to it come on without going all the way come on but not so he says i made it i made a a separation between you and the world didn't he say that he said i don't want you to be like them when you go into the habits of the land he said i took the land from them because of the things they doing because of the lives they live in because of the sin in the camp so when you go in there don't do like them or i'll do you the same way i did them hallelujah so we find ourselves sometimes like i said at those crossroads come on i said lord just let me walk according to your word like i said i was praying lord you know me i said god you know me search my heart and try my reigns god don't let me covet the things of the world but let me get as far away from the world as i know how god don't let me covet bring the curse things in what's got my well stopped up what's got my blessings from flowing why are my back turned all my enemies god revealed this thing hallelujah so what happened he had to search it out didn't he search it out i said sharon on sunday i was saying search it out come on search out the camp hallelujah search out your own soul salvation with fear and trembling search it out hallelujah because it'll be a day when you need god you reach back for him and he might not be there come on hallelujah i said you know the thing is you know we can go there but i said the thing is you know sometimes we always feel a comfort like i was saying about samson he always knew that those locks were a covenant didn't he i said but the morning that he woke up to go out the face face the enemy god went with him and he didn't know i said if he would have thought once to reach back he would have felt that those locks wasn't there no more but he went out just just uh you know believing that god was still with him convinced that it was because so many times he went in and out and seems like the guard was still there but it was one time when he did that come on that god left him didn't they and then he was just as any other man but before that what was the difference the supernatural you know i said you know they began to search it out joshua began to search it out but one thing how you know look at how that stopped the well look at how that stopped as as just a couple chapters as you can read over as he says i'm gonna be with you making all these promises these blessings i'm gonna be with you i'm gonna be using all these things but then he said but now i want obedience from you come on he says but then you go right over here he said now i'll no longer be with you come on just like that god stopped stop the show i said god don't don't don't don't allow my well to be stopped up come on i don't want my will stopped up but i want to search it out how many want to search it out tonight so we fine i said he said as i was come on so shall i be you know i says tonight by the grace of god it might be 2021 almost 2022 things is going on technology and all these things and people mind just seem to be getting further away from god in the supernatural why because everything is so accessible everything is so in a relaxed state come on you got so many other options but sometimes god let those options run out and put you in a corner i was sharing with someone uh yesterday i said we can always talk about somebody else trial and what they're going through and how you would have reacted i says but until you go and walk that walk that walk that they walked walking those shoes that they've been in then you can't speak on that situation come on but i do know one thing that no matter what comes your way god will put no more on you than you can bear now that's gonna be the truth anyhow hallelujah but what do we do we get on our knees and we pray for people all the time how many believe that tonight so i says you know as i was i don't i didn't want to be long i had a couple other things i said but but anyway as i was so shall i be come on i said as i was so shall i be with you as an individual do you believe that tonight i believe it amen [Applause] god is good amen god he's the same yesterday today in failure amen i was just reading today and thanking the lord for election because he said make your call in the election sure but i was thinking about the elect in your election and i thank god that he's given us his grace he chose us to be the elective god that means god chose you and i and not only did he choose us but by his grace he saved us amen i was thanking the lord the prophet said he said he saved us by grace it's not what we've done it's what he's done for us and um the point is he says because of that works is what we do and grace is what he's done for us amen he died shedded his blood he saved us grace is what he done for us and works is what we do out of appreciation for what he's done are you with me you know sometimes i don't think that we appreciate the grace of god in the election of god the elect you were chosen special amen and because of your god choosing you out of all the people of the earth god said you're special and he chose you and all in return we ought to appreciate we ought to love him and say thank you jesus every day of our lives we ought to dedicate our lives out of appreciation but you know folks they are not really understanding the grace of god towards them and that's why people have an attitude of they're not appreciative for what god has done for them they don't thank him and they don't see a need give god all the glory as we know as paul stated we're not sufficient of ourselves as to think anything of ourselves but our is of him it's because of him amen we don't have any strength any power in any might of our own he's about our sufficiencies of god it's because of his power that he keeps us amen it's because of his grace that he saved us and it's his grace that he's keeping us you know it don't don't take about a second for you to lose your mind boom it don't take about a second i remember the other night i was just laying in the bed and something just dropped on me i said god next thing i know that i was feeling so much pain in my chest because i i felt it don't take about a minute but something just drop on you and i knew what i was dealing with it was spirit see the devil can take you out at any time so i had to start fighting back in the spirit realm i had to start believing god and and the battle was on for some days until god little by little but i had to keep the faith because it don't take these things happen and all of a sudden you can lose everything rachel was talking about one of the students dying you know one of her students i mean one of the students from a couple of years ago died and you know it was you know young people did but the garden was telling me about praying for brother jason watkins in the church down there 20 people got covered and one it's critical you know and different ones you know things uh brother caleb was telling me pray for brother van vaniel his wife died kovalev and trinidad and uh so we got so much going on so fast brother and sister i said it's praying time if you ever needed to pray you need to pray now are you with me so so many things happening so quickly are you with me so uh as these things are moving so fast if they are moving like they're moving then we need to get with god amen so by the grace of god let's let's get ahold of god in prayer amen because things are moving fast amen praise god my heart just went out for uh brother van you know since cedar was just such a nice person amen i'm going to tell you something brother if we don't pray now when are we going to pray if we don't get a hold of god right now when are we going to get a hold of god i said the season is now the time is right let's get a hold of god let's cry out to god now so i i wrote down some let's let's just smile for a moment father in jesus name as the song has said i lift my eyes to the heels for which cometh my help for my help coming from the lord that made the heavens and earth father i pray now that you would look upon thy children lord and look upon my brother van and his family god and brother jason watkins in the saints there father i just pray for lord god even the saints here lord and lord as many missing tonight lord we don't know what the trouble is but god you know every need lord father we ask you to touch hearts touch lives give comfort gifts strength father in the name of jesus we need you now hallelujah what a friend we have in jesus all our sins and grief his bears what a privilege it is to carry everything to god in prayer father we pray now that you would fill us with such zeal oh god the spirit and power of god lord man happen tonight but something oh god conviction oh god hit the hearts of the people lord there know god that there's a god oh god in zion oh god that there is a deliverer here deliverance is here jesus is here power god is here have your way say lord we thank you for all things we thank you for moving we thank you for healing in jesus name amen david come on up you got a testimony god bless brother david amen [Applause] [Music] so that i don't waste much time but i'm just going to a reference to what the minister preached today i know not many of you know who i am it doesn't really matter why you know who i am it doesn't matter what you know christ the reason why i'm coming out here because i want to let you know that i'm the living testimony for all what he has said today all through i've stepped my foot in this country all through my endeavors my education my jobs god has always seen me through he's always been there to bless me financially he has moved me from once one level to another level financially i've never gone back i reach a point right now that when i'm talking with god as i know him he said one thing to me this is what he said he said listen just as he watches me he knows who i am he knows my limits he doesn't need to anticipate whether i might fail him or i will not fail him that's the same way he wants me to know him to believe in his words to take his words that my strengths have been healed they provide all my all my knees conscious which is in glory that's when you start returning i was like when you could wake up like the critical song say i'm going back because i know my father i know who he is when those sons and daughters start waking up but i'm telling you not only on the financial part in terms of racism people who look at me say how can this guy be in charge of us he sounds different how does he know so much and how god just put them in their place for me without me even fighting you know i'm not trying to suck up to them because i know who is in charge on both sides there's god it has nothing to do with oh that guy's though he has all the money i know he's the lord he works on both sides and when you start to surrender he will always gonna be there for you and i pray that we can all come to that point you can get the last seed and we can get out of here amen praise god thank god for brother dave he don't say too much but we thank god for him his testimony amen um we want to like i said we want to continue to pray for jason and the church there and beaufort and brother van g's family and i want us on

because we got to it's later than we think we got to get out of here and our fasting and our praying we want to get back there's something that was listening to what the prophet said he says you got to have that quickening power that raptured power you got to have it amen there ain't no doubt about it you've got to have the quickening power each and every one of us that you expect to be raptured you're gonna have to have the quickened power it's not i think i got the holy ghost maybe i got the holy ghost you're gonna have to have it and i said a church that's in prayer and a church that's on fire now if you don't want to go to heaven then that's up to you but one thing about it we're going to pray and we're going to seek god as we never did before let's seek god let's see what god would do okay i'm i'm telling you ahead of time that you can get yourself prepared if you need to walk and get some exercise because i want you to pray and not go to sleep okay god bless you thank god for everyone let us stand it won't be long soon we'll be leaving here amen it'll all be over with after a while and i know you don't want to be left here with all this that's going on i i'm gonna tell you something you you might have things in in in your mind that you got planned for the future but we have a future home amen and that's heaven let's bow father we thank you again for the word tonight thank you for our brother ernest we thank you for brother dave and we thank you for each and every one that come tonight lord and those that are listening in father we pray god that something is said that will draw our hearts closer to you for lord that's what we want we want a closer walk with you and lord help us to have that closer walk granted father in the name of jesus christ and lord god be
