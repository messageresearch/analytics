[36:54] in his prevailion
[36:56] in the secrets of his tabernacle shall
[36:58] he hide me
[37:00] he shall set me up upon a rock together
[37:03] now shall my head be lifted up above my

[37:16] unto the lord
[37:18] amen god bless you may be seated we
[37:21] thank god amen
[37:23] hallelujah what a wonderful time it is
[37:28] you know these
[37:30] this just seemed like
[37:32] when when i was
[37:35] praying and
[37:36] meditating on the lord and
[37:39] then um i just got up this morning with
[37:42] something on my heart
[37:46] in the time of trouble
[37:50] i know that you and i are looking at
[37:54] our surrounding in the world today
[37:58] i said the whole world is in trouble
[38:02] we can look at the pandemic and we can
[38:04] look at the different things that are
[38:06] happening
[38:08] the occurrences
[38:11] the modern events made clear by prophecy
[38:16] we understand that it's too many things
[38:19] happening
[38:20] to
[38:21] uh that we'll
[38:23] we can look around we say we're living
[38:24] in troubled times
[38:27] so it's this morning as i
[38:29] think about
[38:31] and on the other day yesterday i was
[38:33] thinking about trouble times we were in
[38:35] trouble times
[38:38] and then my heart was
[38:39] confident
[38:41] when i thought about even though we're
[38:43] in trouble times
[38:45] so i i just shortened it says
[38:48] that verse
[38:50] it says in the time of trouble
[38:54] amen
[38:56] in the time of trouble
[38:59] and uh
[39:00] the webster said trouble
[39:04] in the definition he says it's wary
[39:07] people are worried
[39:10] if it's not about the job it's not about
[39:13] uh the family children or
[39:16] wife husband or there's just so many
[39:19] things to be troubled about
[39:21] the economy
[39:22] it's just so much trouble happening
[39:25] in the school everywhere you look it's
[39:28] trouble
[39:30] so much and so i began to
[39:32] look back at jove and he said the man
[39:34] that is born of a woman is of a few days
[39:37] and full of trouble
[39:39] so that's just
[39:41] but
[39:42] it looks like it's extra added trouble
[39:46] look like we have a double potion of
[39:48] trouble
[39:50] amen as we look
[39:52] every it just looks like it's just
[39:54] his trouble has increased
[39:57] it says
[39:58] trouble having to do with worry
[40:01] you get people are worried about
[40:03] everything nothing is stable
[40:06] so people are just
[40:08] worried
[40:11] care
[40:13] anointings
[40:16] then it talks about trouble being
[40:17] suffering
[40:20] difficulties
[40:23] unhappy
[40:26] situations
[40:29] people
[40:30] don't seem to be happy anymore
[40:33] unhappy situations disturbance
[40:38] so as i was looking at that i said
[40:41] in the time of trouble let me
[40:44] just
[40:44] let you kind of
[40:46] view that jesus understood that the time
[40:50] that we're living in was coming
[40:54] so in matthew
[40:57] 24
[40:59] and 3
[41:00] matthew 24
[41:03] and 3
[41:04] jesus addressed our time in the day that
[41:07] we're living in
[41:09] and he says
[41:11] in matthew 24 and 3 says
[41:14] and as he sat upon the mountain of
[41:16] olives his disciples came unto him
[41:18] privily saying tell us
[41:21] when should these things be
[41:24] what shall be the sign of what
[41:27] god coming into what
[41:30] end of the world
[41:31] you know that was over 2000 years ago
[41:33] that they were concerned about the end
[41:35] of the world
[41:37] now what would make them think that the
[41:39] end of the world would come in their
[41:41] time
[41:44] and what would be the sign of thy coming
[41:50] and tell us when the end of the world
[41:51] gonna come
[41:57] jesus in the fourth verse jesus answered
[42:00] and said unto them take heed
[42:03] that no man what
[42:06] see because he knew that this was going
[42:09] to be
[42:10] such a deceptive time the end of the
[42:12] world we would face such a deceptive
[42:16] time
[42:17] are you with me
[42:19] so people are are being deceived by the
[42:23] millions and by the billions
[42:26] but this was going to be one of the most
[42:27] deceptive times in ever in the history
[42:32] of the world this was going to be the
[42:34] most deceptive time we talk about the
[42:37] mark of the beast and all of that and
[42:39] the bible says he he deceived the whole
[42:42] world
[42:43] so
[42:45] and if he deceived the whole world
[42:47] what makes you not a victim
[42:50] of deception
[42:52] why amen do you think that you shall
[42:55] escape
[42:56] the deception that would hit the whole
[42:58] world
[43:01] he said to us
[43:04] be not what
[43:06] be not deceived
[43:08] because it's a possibility
[43:11] if you amen are not aware or conscious
[43:14] you will
[43:16] be deceived
[43:18] but he says be not deceived
[43:21] then he gives us
[43:23] things that will
[43:24] confront us in this hour
[43:27] as we approach the end of the world
[43:30] he says
[43:31] for many shall come in my name saying
[43:33] i'm christ and shall what
[43:36] to see many
[43:40] it's a lot of folks come in the name
[43:43] of the lord
[43:48] but
[43:50] they are deceiving many
[43:56] because it's not according to the word
[43:58] of god
[44:00] it's not what the bible says
[44:03] that's why paul said though we an angel
[44:06] come from heaven preach any other gospel
[44:10] than that which we preach he said let
[44:12] him be
[44:14] a curse
[44:16] are you with me
[44:19] but we'll
[44:20] believe
[44:22] because they come in the name of the
[44:24] lord they they they say they
[44:26] god sent them and they said god said and
[44:29] folk just accept it
[44:33] because it's been well received by the
[44:36] popular opinion
[44:39] then it must be all right
[44:42] amen because uh the majority of the
[44:46] world is believing it
[44:49] amen most christians amen they are
[44:52] receiving it
[44:55] so it must be all right
[45:00] then he says here
[45:04] you shall hear a walls
[45:07] and rumors of walls see
[45:10] that you be not what
[45:12] we're talking about in the time of

[47:25] young people are throwing away their
[47:27] lives

[47:56] it was trouble time
[47:58] that caused god to say it repented me
[48:00] that i made man
[48:03] but the bible said as it was in the days
[48:04] of noah and as it was in the days of
[48:06] sodom thus shall it be in the day when

[58:28] 10th first
[58:30] and she'll betray what
[58:33] that's what the devil wants you to do
[58:37] betray what
[58:38] that's why the bible say what
[58:41] love
[58:43] and the devil said what
[58:45] betray one another don't you know sister
[58:48] son said that don't you know brother
[58:51] song something i know what he was
[58:53] thinking in you know
[58:55] yeah i know him just a brother sister i
[58:58] know that one
[59:00] oh
[59:01] they would betray one another
[59:03] don't you be a victim of betrayal
[59:07] that i'm gonna be the one portraying my
[59:10] brother my sister
[59:12] that i'm gonna try to tear down their
[59:14] character i'm gonna look at their weak
[59:16] points and i'm going to point them out
[59:19] that's what balaam did he could not
[59:21] curse god people but he pointed out he
[59:24] meant the weakness
[59:26] are you with me
[59:28] and you know amen if we
[59:31] if
[59:32] each and every one of us
[59:34] you can look at us and look at us
[59:36] through the
[59:37] the flesh
[59:38] in me that is in my flesh dwell it's
[59:40] what
[59:41] no good thing isn't that right
[59:43] so you can it is
[59:47] you know when when pilot looked at jesus
[59:49] he said i find no one
[59:51] but you know
[59:55] the bible says
[59:56] now when it comes down to us and we say
[59:59] we have not sinned we make him a liar
[1:00:02] isn't that right
[1:00:04] so what happens
[1:00:06] we we have faults all the time we have
[1:00:08] to ask god for forgiveness
[1:00:11] he said my little children are writing
[1:00:13] to you that you sin not but if any man
[1:00:15] sin he have an advocate with the father
[1:00:17] jesus christ the righteous he's the
[1:00:18] propitiation for our sins and not for
[1:00:20] ours only but for the whole world
[1:00:23] he said if we confess our sins he's
[1:00:24] faithful just to what
[1:00:27] but he wants us to confess and for satan
[1:00:31] isn't that right
[1:00:32] he don't want us to continue and send
[1:00:34] the grace of me about he wants us to
[1:00:35] confess and forsake
[1:00:38] don't just tell god i'm sorry and go
[1:00:40] keep on doing it don't ask god to
[1:00:42] forgive you and you're going to keep on
[1:00:44] doing it
[1:00:45] if you confess your sins and forsake
[1:00:47] them
[1:00:48] are you with me stop doing it
[1:00:51] okay
[1:00:54] so here we are he says
[1:00:59] betray one another and share what
[1:01:02] shall hate one another
[1:01:05] you know it doesn't matter what a person
[1:01:07] say about you do to you whatever you
[1:01:10] cannot because that's not one of the
[1:01:12] attributes of god
[1:01:13] it's not hate
[1:01:15] and when you say i hate him
[1:01:18] i don't like her
[1:01:20] i can't stand her
[1:01:23] sometimes you got to change your
[1:01:24] vocabulary
[1:01:26] you ever heard those things come out of
[1:01:28] jesus mouth
[1:01:32] i said you can hate the sin but not the
[1:01:34] sinner
[1:01:36] so actually you're looking at the wrong
[1:01:38] person
[1:01:39] i mean you're looking at the individual
[1:01:42] you're not looking at the spirit
[1:01:44] the spirit that has them bound taken
[1:01:47] captive
[1:01:48] you need to look at the spirit
[1:01:50] and stop saying i hate her
[1:01:53] it's not her it's the spirit that's in
[1:01:55] her
[1:01:56] then you hate that spirit and you pray
[1:01:58] to god amen deliver them from that
[1:02:01] spirit
[1:02:02] are you with me
[1:02:04] so you know how to pray for them and
[1:02:06] love them
[1:02:08] uh well i i i have nothing to do with
[1:02:10] them i'm a oh no no no no
[1:02:14] if you got love love a cup of what
[1:02:17] a multitude of what
[1:02:18] sin what if jesus said well because you
[1:02:21] did listen i'm gonna avoid you i ain't
[1:02:23] gonna have nothing to do with you
[1:02:26] all you have to do is do that one day
[1:02:29] you can't go a day
[1:02:31] that you're walking so perfect that god
[1:02:33] says
[1:02:34] you're perfect
[1:02:37] but god can say you perfect but he's
[1:02:39] saying you perfect because
[1:02:41] of what your attitude towards the word
[1:02:45] are you with me
[1:02:47] he saw job he said a perfect and upright
[1:02:49] man
[1:02:50] what god can look at him perfect amen
[1:02:53] why because god knew that that man would
[1:02:56] give sacrifice not only for himself but
[1:02:59] for his children
[1:03:01] amen and god saw that man continually
[1:03:05] sacrifice and god knew amen when you
[1:03:09] if you stumble or you fall god knows
[1:03:11] that in your heart you're going to
[1:03:12] repent quickly
[1:03:14] god said david was a man after my own
[1:03:16] heart though he did some wicked stuff
[1:03:18] but david had a repentant heart
[1:03:21] not only did he have a repentant heart
[1:03:23] he wanted to do right and make things
[1:03:25] right and live right
[1:03:28] are you with me but you know some folk
[1:03:30] amen they just do things and thank god
[1:03:33] they're gonna make god forgive them
[1:03:34] because amen i'ma ask him to forgive me
[1:03:37] he got to do it
[1:03:38] god he's a forgiving god and he doesn't
[1:03:41] but you know god people don't realize
[1:03:45] that their action they're not really
[1:03:47] they're telling god what to do they're
[1:03:48] not asking god
[1:03:50] a lot of folk tell god that amen you
[1:03:53] said it and
[1:03:55] almost god you better do it
[1:03:57] are you with me but one day you're going
[1:03:59] to find out god is god and he's a just
[1:04:02] god
[1:04:03] amen he knows whether or not
[1:04:05] you know
[1:04:07] you for real or whether or not you're
[1:04:09] faking
[1:04:11] you know a lot of times folk be faking
[1:04:14] that they're christian and that they
[1:04:15] love god there's a lot of make-believers
[1:04:17] you know
[1:04:18] there's a lot of hypocrites amen when it
[1:04:21] comes down to salvation and being a
[1:04:22] christian there's a lot of hypocrites in
[1:04:24] the pulpit there's a lot of hypocrites
[1:04:26] all over the place
[1:04:28] but that don't have nothing to do with
[1:04:29] you you just be real
[1:04:32] whatsoever you do for jesus let it be
[1:04:34] real
[1:04:35] you have a responsibility for your own
[1:04:38] soul you be real amen let it be real
[1:04:40] whatever you do for jesus let it let it
[1:04:43] be real
[1:04:45] okay
[1:04:46] so by the grace y'all
[1:04:48] oh god god is good
[1:04:51] you love him
[1:04:54] so here we are amen hating one another
[1:04:59] you know
[1:05:00] one of the most wicked place you can go
[1:05:02] to sometimes
[1:05:04] is the church
[1:05:08] people in the club they're so drunk that
[1:05:10] they gonna
[1:05:11] hug the enemies
[1:05:14] people out there at the crack house
[1:05:15] they're so cr they just buy other folk
[1:05:17] crack come on
[1:05:19] people in
[1:05:20] drinking hey you man you want a shot
[1:05:23] they're loving everybody they're so high
[1:05:25] they they're loving everybody man you
[1:05:27] want something
[1:05:29] come on get some of this
[1:05:32] you know what i'm saying
[1:05:33] so people are actually you know doing
[1:05:36] things that
[1:05:38] under another influence or another
[1:05:40] spirit they doing they showing so much
[1:05:42] love one to another but that's not
[1:05:45] godly love
[1:05:47] to give a man a drink
[1:05:49] to give a man some crack
[1:05:51] to give a man a cigarette you know
[1:05:53] you know oh man never got so much i'll
[1:05:56] tell you sometimes look like they all do
[1:05:57] the christians in the right
[1:05:59] but at the same time but when you give a
[1:06:02] man truth
[1:06:04] you're giving the word of god you're
[1:06:05] giving a man eternal life
[1:06:07] are you what man
[1:06:08] you're giving us something that's real
[1:06:10] you're giving it something that
[1:06:10] everlasting whatever they give it it'll
[1:06:13] weigh off
[1:06:15] the
[1:06:16] little friendship of the world a little
[1:06:18] you know people i'm going to tell you
[1:06:19] something
[1:06:20] a true friend you make a man that's
[1:06:23] still going to be your friend
[1:06:25] amen you can talk about them next year
[1:06:27] gonna be your friend
[1:06:29] you can do it wrong they're still gonna
[1:06:30] be your friend that's a true friend
[1:06:33] isn't that right
[1:06:34] a true friend to stick with you
[1:06:37] why
[1:06:38] because they believe that you know
[1:06:40] friendship is a valuable it means
[1:06:42] something
[1:06:44] when friendship is a valuable thing that
[1:06:47] it does mean something to the individual
[1:06:50] and i want you to know
[1:06:52] that a lot of people don't value
[1:06:54] friendship
[1:06:57] they just
[1:06:58] they give up on you quick
[1:07:01] you know i was looking at a a precious
[1:07:03] brother
[1:07:04] that ministered all over the world
[1:07:08] he's running some difficult times in his
[1:07:10] life
[1:07:12] and i said i wish
[1:07:14] that i could you know sit down and talk
[1:07:16] with him
[1:07:17] and see how many friends he got now
[1:07:20] and i thought about job i said
[1:07:24] brother minister all over the world
[1:07:27] probably in
[1:07:28] 75 100 different countries
[1:07:31] but how many friends
[1:07:33] how many friends folk
[1:07:36] church pack hundreds
[1:07:38] of people but when you go through some
[1:07:40] difficult times how many people are
[1:07:42] going to be really there with you
[1:07:45] still sticking with you praying for you
[1:07:49] trusting god believing for you
[1:07:51] i thought about job
[1:07:53] you know sometimes
[1:07:55] in your troubled times they say why
[1:07:57] don't you just go and take your life
[1:07:58] commit suicide
[1:08:00] joe white said why don't you curse your
[1:08:01] god and what
[1:08:03] die you know what's going on no
[1:08:05] no you know you know how it is pressure
[1:08:08] gets so
[1:08:09] difficult and things could go so wrong
[1:08:11] in your life
[1:08:13] sometimes things can get so
[1:08:15] turned around and so mixed up
[1:08:18] so why don't you just go
[1:08:19] boom i mean it's easy or just take some
[1:08:23] just take off
[1:08:24] it's gone it it ain't it ain't worth
[1:08:27] nothing
[1:08:28] so it's all wife one closely you know
[1:08:31] sometimes folk real close to you amen
[1:08:35] they really he's all friends they talk
[1:08:37] about what should have done wrong job
[1:08:39] you know you did this and that amen
[1:08:42] you know every everything your children
[1:08:45] taken and
[1:08:47] your cattle everything your resources

[1:10:04] we're gonna have to have tests and
[1:10:06] trials and tribulations brother and
[1:10:08] sister
[1:10:09] amen but god is expecting us to come out

[1:10:16] furnace of fire amen it's going to be
[1:10:18] affliction and things that you have to
[1:10:20] pass through amen but god said though
[1:10:22] you go through the waters no you go
[1:10:24] through the floods so you go through the
[1:10:25] fire he said i'll be with you
[1:10:28] are you with me

[1:11:32] and i can see him saying weeping man do
[1:11:34] it for a night

[1:11:39] but he said weeping man do it for a
