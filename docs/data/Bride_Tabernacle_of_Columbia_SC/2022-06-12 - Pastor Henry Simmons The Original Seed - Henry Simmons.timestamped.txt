[34:47] hebrews 11
[34:48] and 1
[34:51] through 6. i'll read the first year read
[34:53] the next
[34:54] now faith is the substance of things
[34:57] hoped for
[34:58] the evidence of things
[35:01] not seen to
[35:07] through faith we understand that the
[35:09] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[35:11] that the things which are seen were not
[35:13] made by the things which do appear
[35:17] for
[35:33] by faith enough was translated that he
[35:37] should not see death
[35:39] and
[35:40] was not found
[35:42] because god had translated him
[35:45] for before his translation he had this
[35:49] testimony that he pleads god together
[35:53] but without faith it's impossible to
[35:55] please him for he that coming to god
[35:58] must believe that he is and that he is a
[36:01] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[36:04] him
[36:05] amen god bless you to which you may be
[36:07] seated
[36:10] we want to talk this morning
[36:12] concerning the original
[36:14] scene
[36:16] and we know that
[36:18] the spoken word is the original seed
[36:23] amen and god said let there be light and
[36:26] the bible says there was light
[36:29] amen because god said it it was
[36:33] praise god if you say to the mountain
[36:37] amen because we are coming back into
[36:39] spoken word what was in the original
[36:42] amen would come back amen to
[36:45] amen
[36:47] every seed in genesis
[36:49] 1 every seed must bring forth of its
[36:52] kind so we must bring forth the same
[36:56] seed amen if we deceive amen then we're
[37:00] going to bring forth the bible says the
[37:02] seed is the word
[37:05] isn't that right
[37:06] so he said the parable is the seed is
[37:08] the word
[37:10] praise god this good seed of the
[37:12] children of the kingdom
[37:14] are you with me
[37:16] the tares are the children of the wicked
[37:18] one
[37:19] are you with me
[37:21] but we're talking about the spoken word
[37:23] amen is the original seed the original
[37:26] seed amen
[37:27] praise god sometimes amen we have amen
[37:31] uh uh folks that are a c but it's not
[37:35] original
[37:36] amen it's hybrid seed
[37:39] as the prophet god said in the program
[37:41] is eight it's hybrid amen
[37:43] so by the grace of god we must watch
[37:46] amen whether or not we try to mingle and
[37:49] mix the seed
[37:51] with our own ideas our own thoughts
[37:55] amen
[37:56] so
[37:57] uh
[37:59] eve he met in the beginning amen
[38:02] she doubted
[38:04] the word and because of doubt amen it
[38:07] brought forth death
[38:10] amen in other words amen you cannot mix
[38:14] the word with unbelief
[38:17] you cannot mix amen
[38:19] see
[38:20] satan uh the serpent began to inject his
[38:25] own
[38:27] amen
[38:28] ad amen to the word you shall not surely
[38:31] die
[38:33] we can't add to the word we can't take
[38:35] away from the word the word must be pure
[38:40] the word stands alone
[38:42] by itself is right
[38:45] you can't make the word noble uh better
[38:48] than it is you can't make it no less
[38:50] than if the word stands alone
[38:54] and amen so it it it's the original
[38:58] you know
[38:59] some folks amen the one
[39:01] you know
[39:03] they call false prophets but in order to
[39:06] have a false you have to have a real
[39:09] first
[39:10] amen
[39:12] you have to have a truth before you have
[39:15] a false
[39:17] are you a man
[39:18] in order to have a counterfeit and made
[39:21] off the real
[39:23] are you with me
[39:24] so you got the original the real thing
[39:26] and then you got the counterfeit
[39:29] praise god a lot of times folks that
[39:31] were added to the scripture and some
[39:34] folks are taken away from the scriptures
[39:36] but the scripture must be amen the word
[39:39] amen must be pure
[39:41] you cannot tamper with it
[39:44] praise god it's just like
[39:47] they
[39:48] they take an orange and a lemon and look
[39:51] you know and they put it together amen
[39:54] they take certain fruits and amen and
[39:57] that's what has caused all the trouble
[39:59] amen
[40:01] in the world people have mixed and
[40:03] mangled the seeds
[40:04] that a mustard seed is the smallest of
[40:07] all seeds and and it cannot be mixed
[40:11] amen it's not the size of the mustard
[40:13] seed it's the pureness of the mustard
[40:16] seed
[40:16] it cannot be mixed
[40:19] are you with me
[40:20] so you cannot mix the mustard seed with
[40:24] nothing else amen
[40:26] praise god and now we we look at the uh
[40:30] the hybridization of the age that we're
[40:33] living in and it has caused amen are so
[40:37] many diseases and so many things that
[40:39] happen in
[40:41] in the bodies of
[40:44] folk and having an effect amen on the
[40:47] human life because the of the
[40:50] hybridization of
[40:52] of of people mixing amen and trying to
[40:56] make things better than what god made it
[40:59] praise god see the the devil will offer
[41:02] you uh something better than what god
[41:05] has to offer
[41:07] and that's what happens uh the trouble
[41:09] comes in
[41:10] when we try amen
[41:12] to
[41:14] some folk are trying to make church so
[41:17] much better for the young people to
[41:19] their catering and they're mixing the
[41:21] world with the church
[41:23] amen but we have to have the original we
[41:25] must come back to the original
[41:28] praise god because the spoken word is
[41:30] the original seed it must be the
[41:32] original church it must be the original
[41:34] seed and the original seed would do what
[41:38] god said it'll do
[41:40] praise god we don't have to try amen to
[41:44] entertain we don't have to try to fix
[41:46] something that amen is not broken
[41:50] praise god the word of god is not broken
[41:53] the word of god will accomplish that
[41:56] which god sent me to do
[41:59] you praise god hallelujah
[42:01] praise god you can't make jesus no more
[42:03] amen no greater god than he is and no
[42:06] less amen jesus stands as i am
[42:11] praise god
[42:12] it stands alone
[42:14] praise god
[42:17] and here we are
[42:18] go to um saint john 15.
[42:23] the original seed
[42:26] you know i i look at sometimes in the
[42:29] the mule the mule amen they got they
[42:32] they
[42:33] they took the dunking and the horse and
[42:35] they breaded it amen and they made a
[42:38] mule
[42:39] a mule could be a hard worker but he
[42:42] shows stuff and ain't it
[42:45] and you know when you see folk in the
[42:48] church that's so stubborn you know they
[42:50] got new religion
[42:52] they got their own ideas amen they just
[42:55] can't walk by faith and amen they got
[42:58] the whys and what kind why i got to do
[43:01] it this way and
[43:03] and they can kind of question god amen
[43:06] god is god you don't have to question
[43:08] god if god said it i believe it and that
[43:11] sells it
[43:12] amen but some folk want to know why why
[43:15] i got to do it this way why i got to do
[43:17] it that way if the word they said it
[43:20] they meant we live by
[43:23] amen we walk by faith not by sight and
[43:26] man should not live by what
[43:29] read alone but by
[43:31] every word to proceed out of the mouth
[43:32] of god if god's word said it amen you
[43:36] don't have to see it or understand it

[1:02:13] the truth
[1:02:15] the apostles had love but they told the
[1:02:17] people the truth
[1:02:19] because it was not the truth they could
[1:02:21] not be free
[1:02:23] are you with me

[1:02:32] gift of the holy ghost

[1:02:45] repentance be baptized in the name of
[1:02:48] jesus christ for the remission of sin
[1:02:50] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:02:51] holy ghost if you don't do that then
[1:02:54] what can we do we can't give you nothing
[1:02:56] else but the word
[1:02:58] amen people can give you all kind of
[1:03:01] things amen

[1:03:04] jesus christ in your heart that's right

[1:03:08] be baptized in jesus christ's name
[1:03:12] are you with me

[1:03:15] then you also should receive the gift of
[1:03:18] the holy ghost
[1:03:20] or you have been
[1:03:23] but a lot of times folk give you so much
[1:03:25] just enough
[1:03:27] to make you think you got it all
[1:03:31] are you a man
[1:03:33] they give you enough of
[1:03:35] the truth to make you think you got it
[1:03:38] all that's all you need just a little
[1:03:40] bit of jesus
[1:03:42] you want all that god has for you
[1:03:46] and all that god has allotted for this
[1:03:48] day in this age that we live in we need
[1:03:51] all of it

[1:04:40] don't have
[1:04:41] it's not an illegal impaired and they
[1:04:44] meant the illegitim it's more than
[1:04:46] people that's married
[1:04:50] and in the days of noah the sons of god
[1:04:52] saw the daughters of men and that's why
[1:04:54] the young men don't want to choose the
[1:04:56] daughter of god they want to choose the
[1:04:57] daughter of the men because in the days
[1:04:59] of noah they saw the sons of god amen

[1:05:04] the daughters of men and they married

[1:18:27] the love of god in their heart would
[1:18:28] want anybody to be lost
[1:18:31] are you with me
[1:18:32] but we know that folks are going to be
[1:18:33] lost because folks are going to turn
[1:18:35] down the word

[1:18:39] going to judge him but but i would say
[1:18:40] but we

[1:19:56] he which is john to a holler is what
[1:20:00] one body for the two says he shall be
[1:20:02] what

[1:20:07] what
[1:20:08] one spirit
[1:20:10] the bible said by one spirit are we
[1:20:13] baptized into what
[1:20:15] one body talking about jesus christ

[1:20:54] coming against the word
[1:20:57] the bible truth that you see and
[1:20:59] understand and know
[1:21:00] you stay with the word
[1:21:03] praise god it's not worth your soul
[1:21:06] amen to get off the word to join
[1:21:08] yourself
[1:21:10] to somebody that's off the word
[1:21:12] praise god
[1:21:14] many people left the words

[1:21:19] it just
[1:21:21] they can do what they want to do
[1:21:23] and get to heaven the broad way lead it
[1:21:25] to destruction
[1:21:27] they ain't getting away
[1:21:31] this is some things i wanted to bring
[1:21:33] out but maybe i'll just cut off
[1:21:36] what i was seeing brother and sister i
[1:21:38] was saying that
[1:21:40] people joined themselves to spirits
[1:21:45] and people are not faithful to god
[1:21:47] because they're handing soul out
[1:21:50] if you're not sold out in your spirit to
[1:21:53] love the word don't fall in love with
[1:21:55] brother simmons oh
[1:21:57] i just love brother simon no no no no

[1:22:17] going to espouse you to one husband
[1:22:20] even christ

[1:22:24] see that's what's wrong we
[1:22:26] oh that's my friend not my buddy
[1:22:28] sometimes when it comes down to the
[1:22:30] words you stay with the word
[1:22:34] mama daddy sister brother stay with the
[1:22:36] word
[1:22:38] praise god if anything that not exalting
[1:22:41] jesus christ and not exalting this bible
[1:22:44] amen you stay with the word
[1:22:47] if the message of god sent in this hour
[1:22:50] did anything has brought us back to
[1:22:52] jesus christ and he is the word
[1:22:55] are you with me
[1:22:57] so when we come out of mr battle we
[1:22:59] ain't coming to no denomination coming
[1:23:02] to know this and that we're just coming
[1:23:04] back to the bible
[1:23:06] amen why well we had it all the time
[1:23:09] everybody had it all the time but look
[1:23:11] what they added to it
[1:23:14] are you with me
[1:23:16] folk added to the bible added listen out
[1:23:19] of that and it ain't even scripture
[1:23:22] oh you look man
[1:23:24] so man should not live by bread alone
[1:23:26] but by what
[1:23:29] that's
[1:23:29] that's what we come down to
[1:23:31] and brother and
[1:23:32] sister we got to preach it that way
[1:23:36] we got to teach it that way
[1:23:37] and we got to live it
[1:23:40] are you with me
[1:23:42] it's not no compromising
[1:23:44] amen you don't want to compromise with
[1:23:47] your eternal destination
[1:23:49] if you want to make it in you don't want
[1:23:51] to compromise with nobody
[1:23:54] you love the people
[1:23:57] and you love the center
[1:23:59] you love
[1:24:00] god is not saying nothing about those
[1:24:03] people and the nomination
[1:24:06] it's the system
[1:24:09] i used to hear bishop watching all the
[1:24:10] time say
[1:24:12] about his mom he said the train you on
[1:24:14] the train and the train going in a
[1:24:16] certain direction and you on that train
[1:24:19] and that train go
[1:24:21] you're going with it
[1:24:23] it's it's a system
[1:24:26] now that's why god called us out because
[1:24:28] we know the system where it's headed
[1:24:32] upon this rock he said i'll build my
[1:24:34] church
[1:24:36] then the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:24:38] against it

[1:26:43] on the way we live
[1:26:46] the way we love one another the way we
[1:26:48] care about one another let's let the
[1:26:50] word have a deeper meaning as you look
[1:26:53] out at folks that are maybe walking in
[1:26:57] arrow but they don't know it
[1:26:59] why get upset with them people don't

[1:27:46] because they're not going to hear you
[1:27:49] are you with me
[1:27:51] everybody and then there may be somebody
[1:27:53] else come by
[1:27:54] and they hear them
[1:27:56] and they say this is what you've been
[1:27:58] trying to tell me but i see it now
[1:28:02] so many times that had happened
[1:28:05] we witnessed to somebody
[1:28:07] and they didn't receive us but somebody
[1:28:09] else come by they received them
[1:28:12] that's the purpose of the five-fold
[1:28:13] ministry
[1:28:15] praise god the pastor can't
