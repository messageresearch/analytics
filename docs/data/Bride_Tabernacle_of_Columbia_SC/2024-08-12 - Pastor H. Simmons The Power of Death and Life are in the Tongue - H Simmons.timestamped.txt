[0:27] pretty good somebody come in and there's
[0:30] they shoot a little spirit in
[0:33] there and then and then it spread all
[0:35] over the PE all over the
[0:38] church and he said the most of the time
[0:42] when what you thinking the folks got
[0:44] something against you and all that he
[0:46] said a lot of times they ain't nothing
[0:48] but the
[0:49] devil nothing but the
[0:51] devil you'll find out if you follow it
[0:54] up it's nothing but the devil that's

[1:04] is goodness I'm going tell you
[1:07] something we it it's time to get that
[1:10] poison
[1:12] out of individuals lives
[1:16] amen when you full of poison you can't
[1:19] function right
[1:21] amen my brother the other day they had
[1:24] to cut off his leg because of gang
[1:28] green so they they had no choice but
[1:32] because they could not get the poison
[1:35] out so they had to cut it
[1:38] off are you with
[1:41] me poison will infect your whole body
[1:45] and cause you to be so sick that you
[1:47] can't
[1:50] function now pausing in a Christian's
[1:53] life causes them to
[1:56] be so sick sin sick to they cannot
[2:03] function okay you want to be able to
[2:07] function amen as a Christian amen and a
[2:11] Christian cannot function if they're
[2:14] full of poison amen are you with
[2:19] me now what are you saying he said
[2:21] therewith we bless we God come at the
[2:25] tongue even the father and there with we
[2:29] what
[2:31] which are made after the similitude of
[2:36] God I don't like him I don't like
[2:40] her only thing I like is my little one
[2:42] and two my little crowd I get around
[2:45] them and I I don't want nothing to do
[2:47] with nobody
[2:50] else
[2:52] tongue a lot of people
[2:55] are they're victimized because of the
[2:58] tongue and they're go and they hang out
[3:01] with folk amen that that are are not
[3:05] respectable some folks to become part of
[3:08] gain some people uh they they they go
[3:11] hang out with the people that will
[3:13] accept
[3:16] them and then those other folk that
[3:19] think they uh
[3:21] Untouchable and they're so much better
[3:23] than others those folks will find
[3:28] out in life
[3:30] that they won't be able to
[3:33] function because why they think more
[3:36] highly of themselves than they ought to
[3:40] think God does not La a highminded
[3:43] person amen amen God resists the proud
[3:48] but he give grace to the what the humble
[3:51] isn't that right amen but uh a lot of
[3:54] folks don't care whether you think I I
[3:57] ain't got to be humble because I'm
[3:59] somebody
[4:00] special you don't never get too
[4:04] important that God is not the Bible say
[4:09] wherefore God has highly exalted him and
[4:12] given him a name which is above every
[4:14] name but what what did he do he said let
[4:17] this mind be in you that was also in
[4:18] Christ Jesus and the mind that he had
[4:21] the Bible said he humbled themselves and
[4:24] became in the fashion of a man
[4:26] amen why to die on the cross for us
[4:30] amen he was humble he was God but he
[4:33] came down and condescend amen he didn't
[4:37] think himself no better amen and he
[4:40] became a Friend of Sinners and
[4:43] publicans
[4:45] amen they said they call him a wine
[4:47] begler Friend of Sinners why because the
[4:51] people that thought they were high
[4:52] minded they was in the church and they
[4:54] thought there was somebody special they
[4:56] look down on other folk amen
[5:01] but Jesus said I came to seek and save
[5:03] those that are lost
[5:05] amen are you with me amen so he says
[5:09] here in the 10th verse he
[5:13] says out of the same mouth proceeded
[5:17] blessing and what CS my brethren these
[5:21] things ought not to
[5:23] but you know I I asked the question I
[5:26] this morning as I was praying meditating
[5:29] I I asked ask the question is the mean
[5:31] man
[5:35] happy is the nasty Spirit happy does
[5:39] that make you happy to be
[5:42] nasty you know some people they they
[5:45] wouldn't
[5:46] smile you you give them
[5:50] $50 they might gigle the false
[5:55] conception you
[5:56] know but a main person person just
[6:00] carries a attitude what makes you
[6:04] happy what what does God has to do for
[6:07] you to make you happy make you feel
[6:10] good
[6:12] amen you know what I'm saying it's like
[6:16] what does God has to do for
[6:18] you some people
[6:21] just go in the depressed
[6:24] stage why because they think
[6:26] about the Bible say as he thinketh in
[6:29] his heart what so he and out of the
[6:32] abundance of the
[6:34] heart are you with me so if the if you
[6:38] think your thoughts are wrong then your
[6:41] words going to be wrong that's right if

[11:39] to God what did you say how did he that
[11:42] why because their M their minds are
[11:45] elsewhere

[12:39] many times we put curses on people when
[12:42] when we were
[12:44] little and an old person we walk past
[12:47] the street and you don't never want them
[12:50] to point their
[12:51] hand well we oh no you sudden and
[12:56] respectable cuz if a old person did
[13:00] this and say a little word oh Lord I'm
[13:04] in trouble no no we don't want
[13:08] that we didn't want the older person to
[13:12] speak on us in a negative
[13:18] way when parents tell their child you
[13:20] never be nothing you ain't no good
[13:22] you're
[13:24] nothing I wish I wouldn't have never had

[13:55] teacher and ain't 10 years old
[14:00] why because they done put all that
[14:01] poison in them that's right that's
[14:04] right you notice that people uh uh they
