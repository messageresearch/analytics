the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen god is good this morning amen we want to look at the book of exodus 23 by god's grace you feel all right this morning i try not to hold you alone exodus 23. we thank god for brother stephen his brother stephen stephen right thank god for our brother steven here this morning with us he was a real good help with the tent putting the tent up amen we thank god for all your prayers the lord really blessed us on yesterday we were able to get it up so we thank the lord for that amen god always making a way amy and i believe he's dropping out blessings in the way amen something that we won't have room enough to receive how many believe that this morning i like that and that song that says the sister was singing i know that i can make it come on i know i can stand no matter what comes my way come on you know as i was saying the other week i was riding down the road and and i was saying to myself i said lord i said what's the worst thing in this life that'll happen to me and i said you know what it don't matter i said because i know i can make it through it because it ain't going to be my strength but it's going to be his strength and i said god don't have to show us which he most of time he don't but he says that i put no more on you than what you can bear so that we got to get our mind condition right that we're not afraid of the trials that's overhead i believe it was job said the thing i feared came upon me so we're not fearing what's up ahead we we ready to face the challenge to meet the challenge and it's not because we know we got strength but as greater as he that is in us how many believe that this morning so when we've come to this trial we know that the spirit of the lord is going to do what he's going to lift up a standard against him and sometimes people look at you and put you on a pedestal man you so strong come on but they don't know where your strength come from they don't know where your help where your help coming from i say it like that guy because we look to the heels when we come with our help and we know that there is a power in the name of jesus how many believe that this morning hallelujah you see the word comes when you when we start thinking getting our thinking right and it start changing everything come on like they say you can say hallelujah anyhow say what what trial what's my greatest trial i believe uh paul said oh death where is thy sting come on oh grave where is thy victory come on you got no power over me as jesus said once he said no man taking my life but i lay it down he said you wouldn't have no power over me other than what my father in heaven gave you come on and that's the same thing even here today i don't care what you're going through come on i don't care how your body feels or what you faced with the devil don't got no power over you nothing he can only do whatever the lord allowed come on and if the lord allowed it that means he's going to get some glory out of it he's going to give you grace to make it through it come on and let it like they sing that song god's pulling me through hallelujah i can't walk but he pulling me through come on how many feel like the lord pulling them through this morning dragging them hallelujah amen so look at exodus 23 by god's grace i won't try not to hold you along this morning i want to start here at the at the 20th verse and we'll read the 20th verse and take your seats and behold i sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and bring thee into the place which i have prepared you may be seated we'll read a little further down it says you're talking about the angel he says beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy until thy enemies an adversary unto thy adversaries for my angels shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites and the hittites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the evites and the jerusalets and i will cut them off thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shall utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and ye shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and will take sickness away from the midst of thee don't that sound good this morning he said if you serve the lord your god he shall bless thy bread in thy water and will take sickness away from the midst of thee he says there shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land the number of thy days i will fulfill i will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come and will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and i will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivite and the canaanite in the hit type of from before thee and i will not drive them out from before thee in one year come on he said lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little i will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land i will set thy bounds from the red sea even until the sea of the philistines from the desert unto the river i will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee thou shall make no covenant with them nor with their gods they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me for thou serve their gods it will surely be a snare unto thee my god of the blessed to the reading of his word this morning by god's grace i just want to minister to you on a little topic and i entitled it little by little amen little by little at a sub-topic growing into your inheritance amen i said little by little we find that here you know i've been reading over the scripture now for probably the last two weeks and it's just so many rich things in the word of god that you can't you can't never get enough of so it amen reading i was thinking i said lord oh what a promise that you made them and i said you brought him out of a bondage and then he gets them to a place and he begins to talk to them about blessings come on and about things that were in the land and he began to tell them how he was going to deliver them but it was one thing he he told him he made a promise i like that concerning their health he says that i'll take sickness away from you come on and all these things he says i'll drive out all the inhabitants of the land he says he says that uh i'll be an enemy to your enemies come on and an adversary to your adversary come on i said god god has got your back this morning he says but what i'm gonna do i'm gonna send my angel before you he says and he gave them one thing he says i'm gonna send my angel before you and he says that uh i want you to obey him come on he says that whatever i speak he said because my name is in him and when i speak he says that i want you to obey him now as long as you obey him come on he said it won't be no enemies and nothing to be able to stand before you come on he says because that's that's what it is and i says you know a lot of times we we have we have trouble with that come on that's where the trouble come in we want with a lot of times we looking for the blessings of god which he promised to give us come on but he he also desires that we obey him come on he says that he'll give the holy ghost to them that what obey him we know that a lot of times it ain't in begging god you being a son or daughter god we don't have to beg god for certain things for things because what it is god prom god made us promises so when we come to god we don't we don't have to like lord please please begging god but what it is it's all and saying lord you promised it god i've done my part hallelujah and now god i'm looking for you to do your part and i know without a shadow of a doubt that god not only or is he able to do his part but he will fulfill his part and that's what it is we just come to a place to where we remind god of his promises i remember even um god's promises are so powerful you know one thing about it he said his word left us him out and it ain't gonna return void when god you know it's so much uh power and when god speaks you know mountains has to move situations uh has to come back together lives have to be changed when god speak why because that ain't just like a normal man speaking but that's deity speaking that's that's that's power in in what he's saying so we find that i says what it is you know he even promised abraham once he says that in blessing i'mma bless you and multiplying i'm gonna multiply your seeds he said since you obey me says i'll i'll your seeds would be as one place he said the sands of the sea then he says the stars of the heaven then it says you know all because you obey me and then they come to even uh even a place in the children of israel when they were being disobedient and all i remember one time when they sinned against god and god told abraham i mean now abraham but moses he says that that hey i want you to move out of the way i'm gonna destroy him and i'm gonna raise up a nation of you out of you but i'm gonna show you how how rich god promises is because moses even when god told him that he told the lord he said lord he told the lord he got to repent for even thinking like that come on he says because you made a promise to their forefathers that he was going to bless his seed you made a promise to us for and and god that's the promise that you made and the bible said the lord repented didn't it come on and what to do what to keep his promise and that's one thing about it you know god will do his part come on he's looking for you and i to do our part i said lord what it is in me god i i know they ain't dwelling no good thing come on in my body in the flesh we warn against it every day come on but i said god i want to do my part god whatever you ask of me lord that's what i want to do and i know that when i can get to that place to where you walking in such a way that you ain't worry about pleasing man in the church come on get that out your mind you get to that place the way you walking and you pleasing god then it don't matter what the crowd is saying around you and everybody's doing all this come on i remember the scriptures how david says he says many are they that rise up against me come on looking at his situation many that's saying of my soul there ain't no help with him in god he said but thou o lord thou o lord not the church thou lord not my armies and my weapons thou lord are shield for me my glory and the lifter of my head come on it doesn't matter when the whole world is against you how beautiful is the gospel how he even says when my own mother and father forsake me god will pick me up hallelujah when god is on your side it don't matter nothing don't matter when god is on your side hallelujah thousands of armies might come against you but when god is on your side come on open this man eyes that he might see that it's more with us than it is with them i'm rejoicing in the midst of my enemies in the midst of my trials why because i know where my help come from hallelujah i don't know about you i'm encouraged this morning i'm encouraged i just say to follow jesus oh yes i am come on it didn't say through the through the mountaintops and the sun rises but it says do hard trials tribulations persecution i'm gonna stay faithful i'm encouraged to walk with jesus oh yes i am oh jesus are you encouraged this morning but i said little by little he says that come on i want you to obey the angel come on in his voice and i said that many times we have a problem with that part with the obedience you know i said one time i says that we'll never be able to ever ever charge god and say lord you didn't do what you said you'd do come on because god always do what he said he'll do if you lined up with this word we'll never be able to say god you didn't do what you promised you'd do we'll never be able to hold god with that charge but long as we walk in according to his word come on he said and bless and i'm gonna bless you i'm gonna be an enemy to your enemies i'm gonna open doors i'm gonna make waves come on i'ma drive the inhabitants out in the land for your sake hallelujah why because i love you oh because you were in my mind before the beginning of time come on lord me but it was many that was better god didn't make no mistakes god saw you just like you were hallelujah but he knew the potential that was in you hallelujah and he reached down and he grabbed you i'm so glad hallelujah you know i couldn't and then you said to yourself you couldn't have made it on your own come on come on you in the world lost without god walking in the way of the wicked come on sin was on your mind every day come on but god the bible says it was what rich in mercy he thought about you when you didn't think about him come on he made ways when the devil had right and he was accusing you to destroy you come on but yet god the bloody lamb was there hallelujah covering that hallelujah because he knew that one day you'd come forth one day you desire to repent one day hallelujah you would hear his voice you recognize who you were oh jesus aren't you glad about that this morning i'm so glad hallelujah oh jesus you know i just love that song so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours so glad you found me and you set me free come on you know what kind of bondage we were in you know we were talking last night and brother thompson and those and we were talking about addictions and how drug addictions and alcohol and things you know they got they got heavy holes on people how some would sell their children for a piece of crap come on some would they'd give every they do everything for a piece of for a piece of crap come on they was telling me last night how a man wanted to walk he'd rather walk 10 miles you know from the store just so he can get him a drink come on in the middle of the dark but what it is those addictions aren't they got the people bound it's demon powers come on got their souls in prison spirits bound in chains hallelujah but i know one that can break those chains i know one that could deliver from alcohol i know one that can deliver from crack cocaine and all the demon powers there is no hole too too tight that the devil can't let that guard that the devil got on you that god can't set you free he has no spirit or nothing that's in this world that when god speaks they won't have to let you go hallelujah and that's what we get on our knees and pray for god you speak god send your anointing that will destroy the yokes that'll break the shackles off of people's life we don't just want a good sermon but god we want the anointing because we know that that destroys the yolks that unhooks the shackles sets somebody free that they can come and serve the lord hallelujah oh jesus hallelujah you know i was thinking about that when moses down in egypt and pharaoh began to tell him who shall i let go to go out to serve the lord he says we want our young we want our old come on we want our husband we want our wives we want our cattle we don't want to leave not one hoof behind come on and i thought about that come on as he said even here in the scriptures when you go into the land come on you don't make no pacts and things with them because they'll make they'll be a snare to you come on don't make no pact with the devil come on he said who do you want who do you want to leave who do you want delivered i want my children hallelujah i want your children i want my wife i want my loved ones i want all hallelujah i don't want to leave not one hoof behind god save them all oh god hallelujah we don't have to settle with nothing the devil give us come on god said let them go hallelujah let them go all of them let them go oh jesus how many want that this morning oh god somebody get a lot of praise this morning say what it is come on yo i says we have a problem with that with obedience come on many times people have a problem with that like i said you won't be able to hold god you can't hold god charge and say lord you didn't do come on because if you do what god asks you to do god go come through i know that come on it's not that i believe it i know that that god will come through why because that's his word and heaven and earth will pass away before one one jot out his word past heaven and earth will pass away and god will keep his promise he'll uproot he'll tear down he'll do whatever he got to do come on to keep his promise to you hallelujah but we find that i said that says you know you know in the scriptures it says that you know the obeys are better than sacrifice come on come on some people making sacrifices you say doing god a service and they're not being his will come on sometimes we can say lord i'm doing this for you but what did god ask you to do come on and that's what we say god it ain't that i could do this for you lord come on what did god ask you to do you know i believe saul he says lord what will thou have me to do he could have said lord i could speak so many different languages i've been taught at the feet of gamalia i can do all these things for you nobody i believe he had to understand that lord what will thou have me to do i believe if the lord told him he just want him to hold the door i believe he would have just held the door whatever god asked him i believe in his heart he wanted to do whatever god asked him to do and that's what it is come and come in like it says obedience is better than sacrifice lord not saying what can i do for you what i mean what can i do for you lord but lord what will you have me to do god help me find my position you know we were preaching on the foundation a couple of weeks back and says you know that all the stones are fitly framed together to do what to build up the house of god come on when you're talking about some when you talk about being fitted you know like some of those pipefitters and those welders and stuff when they fit certain things it's cut out to go in a certain spot come on and then once you begin cutting on that iron and and doing all this fitting that that that piece up or whatever it is only going to fit in one place so it's got to be cut right and sometimes you know we look at perfection i remember working in the steel mill and sometimes it everything we had zero tolerance because it says you know this building going to be 100 stories high so if you allow 16th here in the eighth here by the time you get to the top you might be you feed off way off the mark come on so we had a zero tolerance sometimes the blade we had certain things we had to do to get that you couldn't cut it right so you cut it a little bit over and then send it up to the hill where the meal was at and they milled that thing and perfect come on they wanted perfection hallelujah and that's what it is that's how god what he desires out of our life come on perfection come on you can't say lord come on i'm gonna eat you off it'll be all right no but when he when you go to pl put you in your position come on then if you off a little bit you ain't gonna fit in there right hallelujah so god don't want you to be uh nothing off come on just let the master work on you let the master build you and make you and moses hallelujah lord i'm weak in this area let them work on you hallelujah oh jesus sometimes we got to get down on our knees and cry out to god i remember many times i cried out to the lord and i said lord i'm afraid of myself because i don't know what i'm capable of god take me lord take control of my mind take control of my mouth take control of my hands all these things are important to me hallelujah because when you go to put me in my position god i want to be right hallelujah i don't know about you but i want to be right oh jesus i don't want to be found without the garment on they need to say brother how'd you get in here hallelujah but you got to come in by the door holy hallelujah oh jesus the bible says straight as the gate how many believe that this morning narrows the way oh but only if you will find it come on i pray that we all being that few well he says you know you're talking about like it says i don't want to be able to finish for the sake of time but just laying a foundation come on little by little you know what he says i want you to obey him come on obama you know the obey is better than the sacrifice the harkin the father rams come on he even called it style that has rebellion he says rebellion is as a center witchcraft come on what it is we don't want to obey god when god speaks come on going against the grain what it is rebellion he said it's a sin or witchcraft it ain't a man's word but it's god's word come on lord i want to line up with your word i want to line up with the witness scriptures god at all costs if i got to lose friends if i got to lose this money i got to lose all god i want to line up hallelujah sister used to sing a song if my soul is lost it won't be nobody fault but mine oh jesus and i say that even this morning if your soul was lost come on we've been ministering the last two weeks on that day it's gonna be between you and god you'll have to give an account for the way you lived hallelujah but i want to be able to say lord i did the best i could hallelujah with what i had a fault with all i had god when my strength was gone i crawled him oh jesus i did all i can do how many feel like that this morning come on i says little by little oh god made them so many great promises didn't he come on but he laid that before he says i'm gonna send my angel before you say my name is in him come on and i want you to obey him come on and if you obey him i'm gonna open everything up for you come on but i like how he says i like how he says in the scriptures here he says it in the in the in the 30th verse well let's look at the 29th verse again and this is where i really take my topic from he says i will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little i will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land come on i say what it is a lot of times you know we live in in in this age in this hour where we want things so fast come on we want it and just sometimes if god didn't just just do it just that quick sometimes that's when we get into that mold lord you didn't do what you promised you'd do come on but what it is you know it's even said that your right mental attitude toward the word of god or bring any promise of god to pass come on your your mental attitude got to be right you'll find some that that say they get nothing out of the word but then you'll have the man right next to him he getting all come on why sometimes it's the mental attitude some people they want to tempt god god you like you god do this come on but didn't the devil try that come on and it didn't work did it we don't force god hands like that come on he's god he don't have to prove himself come on he's god he can do what he want when he won't it's not in us but then you'll have that man that other man come on that he's not trying to force god hallelujah but he's in real need he need god to do something for him he need god to make a way come on he he said lord i need your help oh my enemies dysphoria i think about jacob he said i got to meet esau tomorrow and i'm afraid of him come on on that other side he was fighting he was then he began wrestling come on when he needed god then god showed up didn't he come on i said do you need god this morning he said i'll supply your needs according to his riches in glory i don't know about you but i need god i need god every day lord i need his help every day i need his touch every day i need god hallelujah oh jesus maybe you don't need god or you think you don't need god i heard somebody say one time i says i says to myself i says i said i said i wouldn't have made it this far if it wasn't for god he's the only reason why i'm here and i heard somebody say i made it this far without him come on but i said you say that in ignorance because you can't take one breath without him you can't walk unless the lord hold your hand you when you lay down at night you would have never got up if it wasn't for god come on oh jesus things can change in a split moment that's why when we walk we thank god that's why we get home we thank god that's why we get our meal to eat we thank god that's why when that money hit the bank you thank god that's when you get your card crank it up you thank god hallelujah because god didn't have to do it yet he did hallelujah oh jesus hallelujah i don't know about you but i need him i need the oh i needy come on not every day but every hour i need you every minute i need you i need you

gonna prosper you i'ma i'm gonna drive out of here as he says until you grow into it come on that's why we said growing unto your heritage come home god don't give it all to you at once sometimes he know that'll destroy you but he allows you to grow into your inheritance grow into it come on little by little how many believe that this morning but we find that i said that that's that makes a you

comes to those who need them god know you need them come on but he'll wait but we were saying once he'll wait till the hour get real dark on it and then he want to see what's your attitude towards it
