Pastor to stand behind this sacred desk I appreciate some of our church folk came with us tonight we appreciate that you don't know me some of you may know about me but just for a moment before we get to it let's won't hold you long won't preach long I'm mindful of that I know some's got to travel back a good dis it's but just for a moment I want to I want you to take a journey with me and tell you about my life how I ended up where I'm at now I was born in Florida not too far from where we spoke of our brother there spoke of s choppy had a brother that's pastored in that area still today he's been pastoring about 55 years I'm the baby of 14 children the same mother and same father my grandparents were in in the late 1800s my father was born in 1917 we were not religious people my father and mother never talked about God they never mentioned God we didn't have a Bible in our home we were poor the home that I grew up in had holes in the walls they had no windows and some of you can relate to that old day they didn't have screens and sometimes in the night I heard some of my sisters screaming cuz a cow had got out the pastor and come and lick them on the face reaching into their bedroom we didn't we didn't have we didn't have of ourselves our own bed everything was shared by three or four children sleeping in one bed we didn't sleep long ways we slept sideways being the least of the 14 I never had the privilege of ever being able to sleep on the end but one time and I'll tell you about that in just a moment my older brothers my dad was an alcoholic he didn't serve God and he worked Faithfully he had to raise a lot of kids we worked a farm and my my father and mother didn't take us to church at that given time my father's the only guy I know that would leave home broke and come back with a fth of liquor and he's a type of guy that when alcohol got into his body brother he turned into a devil and he wanted to beat anything that was in front of him first of all was my mother and then Mom would get all of us kids up and take us to the woods and keep us out in the woods to 3 or 4:00 in the morning my father would pass out and then Mom would say it's safe to come back into the home and we'd go back in and get what sleep we could and then off to school we didn't have a school bus to pick us up at our house we had to walk three and four miles to meet the school bus life was easy to the extent of what it is today we we had to work I milk cows I milked 110 cows every morning morning for I went to school that's not with hands that's with an automatic milker cuz some ladies I told that to she said you do it by hand no I don't think I could make it to school if I had to milk 110 cows when I got off the school bus I had to repeat the same process because so many kids it was a farm life one of my older brothers had turned to drugs and through that drug life he became pretty well wealthy at the time he had retes he had Trans Ams he had Condominiums he had Rolex watches and then during the summertime what break I could get I'd go stay with him and it was my brother there that one that had introduced me to drugs at a young age before long it wasn't just doing marijuana it wasn't just doing cocaine but now it's doing acid barbits Etc by the time I was 12 years old my mind had been burnt the psychiatrist being four of four different psychiatrists had told my mother that I'd never retain that if you told me something I'd forget it five minutes later my life had diminished but I didn't know anything about religion I didn't know anything about God and that's the life that I took and it wasn't before long until one thing led to another my brother one afternoon asked me to ride with him to a house and in the paper sack was drugs I never seen them I just held them and he asked me to go to the door and pass the door through the drug uh the drugs through the door and they'd give me money and come back to the car well that will sound simple but it didn't happen that way that night that afternoon I was cut under the eye with my eyeball on my chin I went running for my life my brother left and I was shot in the back with a shotgun I'd made it to the swamp not too far outside of sop choppy and it crawled through the woods to make it through that about a city block there was a highway where a 72y old lady had picked me up that morning and took me to the hospital I knew there was something on my life but I didn't know what it was why God kept sparing me over and over it was after the getting out of the hospital my brother asked me to come back and stay with him I stayed three or 4 days it was during that time I had ODed on acid and tried to jump out of a car going 60 miles an hour when they had got me to the hospital they were working on my body I was trying to trying to uh pray in my thoughts I couldn't couldn't talk I couldn't breathe I couldn't get nothing out and I kept saying if there is a God I didn't know this God I didn't know nothing about this Jesus I said if there is one I need you to save me I need help I don't want to die like this God spared my life that day then before long about three weeks had passed this is this is the only time in my life that my brothers let me sleep on the end of the bed that night about 3:30 in the morning I felt something holding my hand there was a fire that illuminated up my whole arm right to the side of my head when I woke up there was nothing standing there but I could feel a presence I didn't know what it was I was scared I jumped up left the room and as most boys would do run to Mom that's the comfort and I told my mom I said there something in that room I don't want to go back in that room they said your brothers are in that room I said there's something in that room I don't want nothing to do with and my mother for the first time said Son do you know the Lord for the first time she mentions do you know the Lord and I said the Lord do you know that guy lives up there yeah that guy do you know him I said no Mom I don't know him so my mom prayed with me what little prayer she prayed what little background of Religion she had she was a good mother she was the best mother to me in the world my father not so much at that time and then it was after that morning about another three days would pass until I'd have a dream and then then this dream this whole time God's dealing with me but I don't know him but it's a process it's a step because what I want to talk about tonight is that you're God's promise and I'm going to prove to you by the Bible how you belong to God God and you know you you may not can get to God but he'll sure get to you RJ Reynolds he was a prime example he was the guy that founded the the Winston cigarette company he was an atheist at heart didn't believe in God didn't he and and his son had to be tutored inside of a prison being inside the house with a chain lead fence that's put around this entire premises of this Palace in which RJ Reynolds owned and but that young boy his own son was educated by tutors that was paid for and brought into the home and then one day RJ had to go up to Michigan to one of his conventions and he he he had lost his janitor who had taken care of the premises and the hedges and hired somebody else but little did he know that the man that he hired was a man that was Holy Ghost filled Hallelujah RJ had left town and that man got out there and was cutting the grass and doing the hedges and he'd sing songs like Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound he would sing a song like I fly away he would sing a song like oh Victory in Jesus and before long he had got up there to the window and looked in and saw RJ Reynold's son satting on the edge of the bed and he he thought that boy needs to know about Jesus he goes and knocks on the door and that young boy comes and opens the door and he said sir can I help you remember you can't get to God he'll get to you he said son I want to ask you a question have you ever heard about Jesus he said sir I've never heard that name because like my parents RJ never allowed a Bible in the home he never wanted to infiltrate his son's mind with any knowledge of religion or anything to do with Jesus but this man said I want to tell you about the greatest man that ever lived he was more than a dead risor and a sea Walker Oh no to the architect

couldn't take it out of his heart this would be this would be my story I couldn't get to God I didn't know anything about God I couldn't find God I didn't know how to pray and then one one uh day of the week my mother asked me to go to the bank with her and asked me to go in and make a deposit and I did and I bumped into a man on the way out and he stopped me he said son I'm going to give you thus saeth the Lord and He prophesied I didn't know what prophecy was he prophesied and said you'll be an evangelist you'll travel to the United States and you'll go to Foreign Fields well I've been to 40 countries amen we were poor there's no way I could have ever travel we didn't have no money he gave me a prophecy and read my life and I went out and told my mother I said there's a guy in there's a fortune teller he's telling me what my future is amen said what did he tell you he said I'd preach he said I'd travel amen and he he said I I even go to forign Fields my mother l she said don't he know we're poor we were you got one pair of shoes a year if you wore them out that was it and being the baby of the 14 I didn't I didn't get hand-me-downs I got hme Downs nothing fit me cuz everything got passed down everything I had was patched all your clothes was patched you you folk know what I'm talking about some of you times might have been difficult and hard but it was my upbringing to come to God and I remember I remember on this particular night when when I had had that dream of hell and I told God in that dream I said I don't know who you are but I don't want to go to hell it wasn't long after that that God gave me inspiration I gave my heart to him and then I had a desire to go to church my mother and father said well we go as a family first time we're going to a Baptist Church amen and then from the Baptist Church we graduated we decid to step up a little bit move to the Methodist Church so we went on up to the Methodist Church and like most churches to me there was no life there you couldn't get an amen you couldn't get a smile out of the congregation you couldn't get a Hallelujah you couldn't get a wave offering it was just dead and it never spoke to me and I must confess please forgive me amen I'm a healthy man at my age but you sit on the back row and look up and see the chewing gum people have left and I'd grab that Red Man chew it a while put it back don't know who it belong to wouldn't do it today wouldn't recommend it and I'd grab that spearmint chew it a while put it back cuz I knew next week it'd be waiting on me amen that's the kind of life that I got out of going to church my sister dropped by she had done older sister she had done got married moved away and she found the Pentecostal Church and she says Mark I want to take you to a Pentecostal church I said what Pentecostal what is that said well you've been you went to the Baptist Church all right the Methodist Church but it's just a little bit more life than what I said I want to go amen if there's a church that's got some life that's where I want to go I went in that old church and there was a big old uh H wood stove over here top of it was cherry red that's how they heated the church bigger one right over over here and it was cherry red man if they would have warned me and told me how dangerous it was to go to a Pentecostal Church got look back then then white women wore their hair up here and it had about 400 bobby pins that was planted into it to hold it up called The Beehive and if you'd have told me how dangerous it was I'd have took goggles in a football helmet cuz when them women got to move in their heads and bobby pins were flying every everywhere you could get your eye poked out but I watch I watch the move of God take place in that church and them women and men get to running and to come around that corner they'd push off the top of that red cherry hot top of that stove and I that's the first time I'm introduced to Pentecost so I go back home just a young kid my dad had an old Corn Crib where we used put corn in one corner of that old corn crib and potatoes in the other and I'd lay there on my face between those two uh vegetations and pray and say God I need I need this thing called the Holy Ghost I want to have an experience like I have never had an experience and as time went on God gave me an experience after experience 1978 I get a call they didn't have cell phones or beepers then and I get a call and they said are you that young boy maral that just found the Lord had an experience delivered from drugs I said that's me they said we want you to come give your testimony at our church tonight Assembly of God Pentecostal I said I'll be there and hung the phone up and then I got to thinking who were they where's the church at what's the address I don't even have license and I'm sitting there pondering that I'm so excited about somebody wanting me to come talk and then the phone run back and I said yes please give me your address I wrote it down I've been preach I was a Street Preacher then I I was in Pentecost I'll tell you how I got to the message just in a little bit this is all under Pentecost and I called a boy who I had witnessed to on the streets that I'd led him to the Lord named George Smith and I said George I need a ride he said where you going I said 40 miles up the road he said I ain't got no gas I said don't worry about it I've been saving my pot bottles up I'm going to cast them in get you some gas you take me there and bring me back he said okay so he picks me up listen this ain't your normal car this thing had leprosy quarter panel was just shaking in the front like this there was air conditioning in the back floorboards there was no floorboards it's anything could fly through the bottom hey it's a ride I don't care look I'm used to riding horses and mules amen it's okay to ride this old Ford so he he goes to the gas station I cash it in as we get to the gas pumps all I got was $2.95 I can't go 40 miles in a gas guzzler at $2.95 but I wasn't telling George that cuz George was my Thomas he's he's got to see it to believe it so what I did was a little figle had a little Jacob left in me got in behind the car seat pulled up to the next pup which red $20 George walks out looks at the pump says $20 he didn't ask me if I put 20 in I put $2.95 in but I pulled the car up to two to the $20 one we get in the car we get halfway there th this is outside of s Choy a place called ly Haven outside of Panama he starts hit hitting the steering wheel and he said you lied to me you lied to me I said I never said a word the pup lied to you the pump said $20 but if you look at the other pump that's the one I used I said look George we're halfway there let's finish the ride let's go so I get there we we made it on $2.95 God moved that night young girl 18 years old first miracle I ever saw amen got out of the wheelchair for the first time in 18 years amen over 400 people in the service God moved miraculously we leave I get outside in George we get in the car he said tank is empty he said you get any offering I said offering what's an offering he said you know preachers when they preach the church will give them something I said no I didn't get an offering he said you better go back in in there and ask for an offering I said I'm not going in there and ask for an offering I said look we made it here on $2.95 God got us here he's going to get us back 40 more miles so George was convinced we get halfway down the [Music] road you thought we run out of gas but we didn't we had a flat I jump out of the car I'm on a spiritual High I am praising God I'm I'm lit yeah you know what I'm talking about when you have felt God like you're lit and I was excited I was looking up to the Stars I was thanking God and George is still sitting in the car I said George come on open the trunk he's still sitting in the car I knew something's wrong George we don't have a spare do we he said on top of that we ain't got a jack I said okay George I'm gonna take the Bible and I'm going to do exactly what it says God be my witness to the day I send before the Judgment this is exactly what I did I laid my hands on a sick Tire Bible said lay hands on sick didn't say sick people that's how I computed as a young preacher and I said God I need air in this tire I need to get home Lord I need you to put air in this tire and I prayed and I said God I believe you I believe you I went back behind the car George is sitting there with that old doubt and Thomas spirit and all of a sudden I could hear the noise he heard the noise he jumped out of the car cuz it's something was going when George jumped out they was air right back in that time that's my second Super natural that I seen God do I don't have time tonight to share my whole life but my journey started in 1978 in 1988 in that 10year period I was already on four television stations I had built a Pentecostal Ministry to 8 and 10,000 people that's how I blossom in 10 years in 1988 I was pastoring a church a little over 200 people in morgon and God sent a little seed woman in that Pentecostal church that started giving me quotes of brother brandham and then it got to where she says to my wife who is here tonight Sister Hall we just celebrated our anniversary and by the way it's my first wife my last wife it's the only wife I've had don't have another one 38 years that's my sugar booger and I ain't letting go of her I'm keeping her she's got me trained you don't want to stop when you get trained don't want to start over she said it's too far to drive back to my house every Sunday can I come to your house oh Lord that was a mistake for me but not for God I had no way of getting to God but God got to me she every Sunday brother Holloway she would bring quote after quote after quote and then she brought me a sermon called serpent seed I listened to that sermon on serpent seed seven times and the light went off I told her I said she said do you see what's happened in the message of the hour that this Pentecostal shout and all the emotion some of it's fake some of it's real I said I understand she said you got to make a decision I said oh no I'm not splitting my church I got so traumatized folks this is the truth I was under so much pressure because if I accepted this truth that's being presented to me the message of the hour I'm going to lose my church and all these conferences that I have built that I was preaching in in the television stations I had reached the Pinnacle of my Ministry and if I if I go this direction I'm going to lose every bit of it and I'm going to be right back to right back to the start I would not have no Fellowship this is how traumatized I became I took a 357 Magnum went out in the woods loaded the gun stuck it to my temple and pull the trigger I had to make a decision suicide was the way out for me but when I pulled the trigger nothing went off and I pulled the trigger trigger nothing went off and I pulled the trigger nothing went off when I held in the air and fired it it went off when I held in the air and pulled the trigger it went off went off not here but up you can't tell me God don't ordain lives even our Prophet attempted his own life to be taken to God I made the decision I lost everything Ministry went to nothing didn't know any brothers didn't have any Fellowship got death threats got bad letters it got so bad financially I went from being Supreme to nothing that they repossessed my two vehicles they repossessed my house move five kids and a wife into a 15t travel trailer only because I was willing to accept this message would you do it again brother Hall in a heartbeat in a heartbeat cuz everything that was taken from me God has returned it back a h hundredfold over and over and [Applause] over so since 1989 to this day I have studied and preached the message of the hour and preached around these states and preached in 40 countries and I'm telling you I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now but I know where God brought me from and if you will be real with yourself tonight you can see that when you were even out and sin you can see the hand of God was on your life if you wouldn't mind could I just share a little just a little thought and then I'll close Exodus chapter 12 I got several scriptures I want to join right in here Exodus 12 and verse 30 uh 46 if you want to stand for this reading of the word is this okay tonight I wanted you to know who markall was where my journey has been and what's brought me to where I'm at it wasn't without a fight it wasn't without a battle but I wouldn't take nothing for my journey and all my kids have served under my Ministry and almost we got 11 grandchildren and one to be here in December God's been good to me in Exodus 12 and verse 46 in one house shall it be eaten and thou shalt not carry forth alt of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall you break a bone thereof listen to that thought neither shall you break a bone thereof St John chapter 19 and verse 36 St John 19 verse 36 St John 1936 for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken father thank you for this word thank you for this church and this church family thank you for these lives that have stood the test of time who have their own testimonies God I just ask that you would help me with this gift to get out of the way and speak to the heart tonight we need your help Lord we ask in Jesus name amen you have your seat just a thought I goingon to hold you we find that there's a prophecy of an ordinance that going forward after they come out of Egypt that when they do the Passover each year not a bone of that Lamb's body is to be broken we find that David speaks also about the bones of Jesus and not one bone of his body shall be broken then John said these things were written or prophesied in the scripture that not one bone of his body shall be broken then we find in Luke example in Ezekiel 37 where the spirit of God's upon this Prophet he's carried away in the spirit and God tells him to prophesy to these bones and he asked him he said son of man can these bones live can they live again and he says oh God thou knowest bones why is the scripture in many places talk about the Lord's body's bones and speaks about Ezekiel Israel scattered with bones why is it so important brother Hall well let me tell you a bone means strength a bone is the structure of the whole man bone means power imobil ability for movement a bone is the framework made up of a many member body a bone is unity and every bone is connected to a bone but coming from the scriptures a bone spiritually speaking means promise it means promise we find in Genesis there the setting where God brother bam said that God had attributes he was a father but nothing to father he was a Healer but nothing to heal he was a savior but nothing to save then we find that this despairing longing for Fellowship God would make Man In His Image and as time would go on he realized that when he was absent not walking in the cool of a day with Adam that Adam long for Fellowship so what would God do would he take something of another substance no he is going to show Redemption right here in Genesis 2 the Bible said the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs everybody say bone and he closed up the flesh thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto man and man said this is bone of my bone what was Adam saying he was saying Eve you're my promise you're as much a part of me as I am of you why because woman bride was taken out of man and the Bible said he said your bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh therefore shall a man leave his father and mother in Cleveland to his wife and they shall become one flesh in essence who was Eve she was him she was him she was she was taken from a part of the original creation he amen and Satan would put his nasty foot on this Earth amen vicariously and enter into the serpent brother bandam said it was not it was not Satan himself but it was Satan's Spirit behind the voice and deceived Eve amen and then we call call what cause the fall and there Adam was with his wife who had become educated by the tree of knowledge of good good and evil she's come back to introduce it he had a choice to make amen he could have said hey God start over I got another reib give me somebody else but he couldn't do that because she was part of him and what was eeve to Adam Eve was Adam's promise Eve was Adam's promise the Bible said that Jesus will be formed in Us in the in the the series adoption number two the prophet of God said now he wanted to put things in time amen he had he had made something to worship so his attributes produced this then he made a man then in this man he looked Lonesome so now to know now his great mind what he had his picture of Christ and the church what was happening with Adam and Eve God had pre plan that same thing with the bride and Christ he said that he took not a different piece of clay and made a woman but he took from the side of Adam a rib and took from the spirit of Adam the feminine amen and he put that part inside that bone who was made of Eve like in Eden where there Adam and Eve was in the beginning The Same Spirit their names was called Adam he was both Adam and Eve together and when was he separated to go the test what happened he fell by the word that was the word Adam went after her to redeem her but he couldn't do it he didn't have the antidote he didn't have the the the blood he didn't have the pure blood he was vow amen so what was Adam willing to do he was willing to die for his bride that he might could redeem her he wasn't going to separate himself from her because she was his promise she is bone of my bone she is Flesh of My Flesh then Paul is going to look by inspiration being a prophet he's going to pick up that incident amen and Paul is going to say it this way in Ephesians 5:28 he said so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies that's a lot of loving men Lord that's a lot of loving and he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hateth his own flesh Amen to that but nourish and cherish it even the Lord the church and then Paul would say for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his Amen on son on Adam could not deny Eve no more than God can deny the elect you came from him amen so then can we go on Bones is in the Bible Jesus said look look with me in Psalms 22 and 1 and verse 12 and 14 22 and one see if this sounds familiar now David remember Christ hadn't come yet but but David's going to prophesy and he's going to say my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring look at verse 12 many bulls have compassed me strong Bulls of Bastion have beset me around they gaped upon me with their mouths as raving and roaring lons now what's this verse I am poured out like what this is Christ and all my bones not broken out of joint so to you moms that's got children that ain't in church they're not broken they're just out of joint Hallelujah not one bone of his body shall be broken and David said that his bones cuz when they would beat him with the cat of nine tals two Roman soldiers on either side but unlimited to re resources of whipping a man ever how long they wanted to they they they annihilated his flesh they annihilated his body amen then we find out David said his his bones would be out of joint they cannot be broken why it is a prophecy because bone in the Bible means promise and God will never break a promise that he has given to the church everything he says he can buy it up and will bring it to pass it means to me there's a verse that says not one bone will be broken and that's where we read in Exodus and quite interesting that in Genesis chapter 50 Israel had engaged and come to the end of the road with a leader called Joseph Joseph had gathered the children of Israel together and he said look you make me a promise that you you don't leave my bones in Egypt amen and here's the promise God will surely visit you they're waiting on a prophet they're waiting on a deliverer they're waiting for Jehovah to come down amen now remember Israel lived over here in the suburbs in the place called Goan amen and over here was Egypt amen so sometimes in those 430 something 30 years they get discouraged amen but somebody say come on over here look at this box what it looks like just a bunch of Bones to me no no them bones are a promise there's a promise on them bones amen that one day God will surely visit me he had a promise bones and he said he said in verse 25 he took the oath he made on promise don't you leave my bones in Egypt you going you're going out of here and this is the promise God will surely visit you how many times in Despair and discouragement did they get down amen they wanted to quit but as long Brother Jay as they could see the bones they had a promise and this is true this is true we find that Jesus would go to the whipping post you know what's odd what's odd to me is we always talk about the crucifixion and the bleeding of Jesus on the cross but we forget to fail to realize he didn't shed blood just one time Pastor he shed blood seven times the first time he would be eight days old amen it's called circumcision and it meant he had need of a redeemer the second time he would shed blood is when he'd go into the Garden of Gethsemane and the Bible said that his sweat become as great drops of blood what was he doing that blood was shed for a Deliverance to pave right back our prayers to the throne of God that we don't have to go through a man we can go straight to God the third time he'd shed his blood they had a post about so high amen theyd lay our Lord across that post into his gut TI his wrist to his ankles two Roman soldiers with a cat of nine tails that weighed 200 lb and bringing those 200 lb of velocity those leather straps would go into our Lord's body they didn't rip it up they pulled it to shred his back why was that Bloodshed for brother Hall by his stripes we are healed they were there then put a robe a purple robe on his body put a cross on his back bear him up gala's hill and when he got up there that robe had become a Band-Aid they pulled that robe off his body to reopen the blood amen what was that for brother Hall he said I'm married to the backslider he's a god of a second chance then they would take the crown of thorns and they were driving to his skull amen what was that Bloodshed for brother Hall every demonic every Power of hell that ever fights your mind he shed a blood for the Deliverance the sixth time he would shed his blood is when they nailed him to the cross through his hands and through his feet never for man to die that way again the seventh time he shed his blood is when they had pierced his side and came blood in water now came to the Sabbath day Jesus was still still he was giving up the ghost He loyal he was dying amen and the Roman soldier come up there because by custom after they died guess what they would do they would break his bones but his bones couldn't be broke cuz it represented something to the church it represented a promise not one bone not one promise he ever gave will be broken they could not break his bones because there was a propy that said not a bone will be broken two more and I'll let you go Samson the Philistines he was anointed he was raised up by God to kill the Philistines to deliver Israel they came against him one day and Samson reached over and grabbed a jaw bone and picked it up the Bible said heaps upon heaps what what's that mean brother Hall that means he was cracking through a half inch skull shoving their bodies and piling them up one two three he had done slew a thousand he had heaps he had piling them up heaps upon heaps he had done pile them up brother my call away amen and then he takes the bone his promise and he throws it away how many of us have done that we let go of the promise we let go of the promise that God said you are my child you are my seed start believing what God said you are God said go get the bone GL to God he reached down and grabbed the bone he held it up and God clav the whole Supernatural water came through that hole of that bone the promise was poured out upon him and the Bible said his Spirit revived because bone is a promise Elijah's leaving the scene and he asked Elisha would asked Elijah what would you have me do he said dude I've seen you operate I've seen you work I want a double portion of what you got he said youve asked a hard thing but so be it when you see me go away take the man on well Elisha is on his deathbed one Miracle there was four of Elijah he would be eight he's got seven he's dying and the King joash comes to Elisha and he says he says the king says to to Elisha said hey tell me about our deliverance he said take your bow Heen take your era put it in Elisha got behind him and put his hands on his hands drew the era and shot it out the window he said now take the era and smot it on the ground and the King said one 2 3 three and Elisha got Furious he said you should have spin five or six times and you would annihilated that that that company amen that nationality but because you've only spit three times you only got three victories Elisha dies one Miracle short of fulfilling the promise of a double portion God fulfills This Promise whether you're dead or you're alive the mobites had invaded the city and when they invaded the city the two Israelites had a dead body and they were going to bury it but when the mobites got to chasing them they were looking for a place to stash it and there was a hole there and so they just dropped that by dead body right down in that hole but little did they know they dropped that body down on the bones of Elisha and when that body hit the bones of Elisha he jumped back out why because bones made promise so let me say tonight your bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh brother bandam said that a man can go a long time and not recognize he's a Son of God I did I did but I can see God's Trail and God's hand all the way on my life up to this very hour God is your promise let's stand tonight musicians would you come thank you for giving me a little time to speak and tell you about me just for a moment sorry so lengthy God is a promise and as Adam would say your bone of my bone flesh and my flesh to deny you Eve is to deny me and that's what Jesus is saying brother Brenham typed that out very carefully and said this is exactly what was happenening in the Gard Gardens what's happening with a bride in the church we're bone of his bone right and we're flesh of his flesh let's don't quit on the supernatural God still heals yes sir God still delivers he's in the healing business yes sir I preached a a couple sermons here recently at our church God's attracted to your needs he just needs somebody that's got a need where you don't care about the person next to you you give God a need with sincerity he's coming for you cuz he wants to heal you more than you want to be healed he wants to feel you more than you want to be filled he's still God I believe it's time that we get so sincere before the Lord It's not playing church we mean business with God could we bow our heads tonight father is day David would tell you from his own writings of the scripture he said we're a needy people God we are needy there's so many in the house tonight Lord they need a touch minds are being attacked by the enemy distraught families hurt and pain but God there one thing I would love to see
