you're keeping us each and every day from seeing and unseen dangers lord you're keeping us and lord we want to say thank you lord we ask that you come down lord and i'm missing lord bless this service lord bless your people lord speak to every need tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen let's turn to the book of joshua chapter one amen when you got it say amen amen joshua chapter 1 and it reads now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nine moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness in this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the lands of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i be with thee i will not fail thee nor for safety be strong and of good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto you unto their fathers to give them amen god bless to reading those where you may be seated amen i'd like to speak on a little small topic called don't lose faith amen don't lose faith now we know in the story here we reading about joshua and the children of israel crossing over jordan amen but if you go back previous in the book of in the book of genesis you read about in the book of numbers how moses sent 12 spies into the into what they call the promised land that god had promised them and they went to search out the land and they went to those they went to search it out and they found many things they found out that there were giants in the land there were walled cities in the land there was people a fearful people that they had never seen but and then they found that there was the land was flowing where god promised milk and honey it was a bounty for land it was a plentiful land and then when they came back to the children of israel they came back and there were ten spots to say we should not go up we should not go and possess this land because there are many adversaries in this land there's many problems in this land we're going to have to fight for it we're going to have to struggle for it we're going to go through some things if we go and we possess this land if we cross over jordan and but there were two people joshua and caleb that said no we are more than able to to to possess the land because god has promised it to and they're trying to encourage the people but those 10 spies they went they said if you if you say a bad word it makes it'll spread to 50 people you say a good word it may spread to 10. so those bad spies they went and they sold the seed that we can't do it and they got the people behind them and they realized they convinced the people that we are not able to go up but joshua and caleb they never lost their faith they never lost in believing that god promised us this land and we're going to possess that land so they had so the people they didn't realize by not going into that land when god told them they was going to suffer there was a generation that was gonna have to pass away before they could go into that land and they sat there wandering in the wilderness going in circles because they didn't want to possess what god had given to them in the time that god had sent them sometimes you say lord i want to be in your will not my will because i don't want to be going in circles like they like they went in circles all that time and and joshua and caleb they said no we we want to possess the land and they eventually here in the book of joshua you see that moses had died and most of the people that had done the convincing they had passed away and now god said and i would say now you're able to go into the land he said every every ground that your foot shall tread on that you you're able to possess that land because he gave it to you all the lands of the enemies that you saw before god gave it to you and it's your land to possess amen and if you if you look on if you look in the book of um first kings chapter 17 return to first kings chapter 17 amen first kings 17 we see another person that didn't give up the giving that didn't give up that didn't give up their faith they held on if you read here in the verse 8 it said in the word of the lord came unto him saying arise verse 17 and 8 verse 9. arise get thee to z giraffe zeroff which belonged to zydon and dwelled there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i prayed the immorsal bread in thy hand and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and elijah said unto her fear not go and do what thou has said but make but make me therefore a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus said saith the lord god of israel the burial of meal shall not waste neither shall the crucial oil fail until the day that the lord sinneth reign upon the earth amen in this story you see the servant of god elijah god has sent him by the brook by the brook um and he was getting fed by the ravens god was sending him food by the ravens and they was they were sending him but one day the brook dried up so god said go down to this city there's one there's a widow woman there that i'm gonna have to sustain you and he went down there and he saw the widow woman now the widow woman she was out there gathering two sticks to make a meal for her son her and her son and she basically got to the point this is the end we don't made it this far but this is the end but but something when elijah told her to make the cake for him first she she said but i only got this little bit and he said go ahead and make it for me first and uh and if you make it for me first then you'll then your meal and your oil won't won't run out none until the rain comes and so you see in the story where the woman she could have would could have not listened she could have went about her way and said you know what i don't he talking foolishness let me move on just make this and let's go ahead and we'll we'll make it somehow if we make it if we don't but she she didn't lose faith in the words that elijah told her she didn't she didn't stutter she said you know i'm gonna go do this and and see if it happened if it come to pass then so be it if it don't well we was gonna perish anyway so so she didn't she didn't lose her faith in the larger he had faith in her that she was gonna do it because god told her that she was there if she was gonna sustain them amen and that's just one of the that's one example in the bible that you see where where you don't give up your faith don't ever lose your faith but in the scripture if you go down in james it says but faith without works is dead so if you if you can have all the faith but if you ain't doing nothing about it then you'll never achieve nothing you'll never push forward and god you'll never get down and you never if you don't spend the time in prayer and fasting and getting closer to god and seeing exactly what he wants then you will never get reap the benefits i wrote i wrote down the lord's when dealing with me i said sometimes if you're in school sometimes you're going to school and sometimes you can get to the place where you're going through the motion but some came to me and said how can you expect to get a grades but you're giving c effort how can you expect to get a grades but you're given c effort now sometimes you might you might multiple choices just write and get an a but there's a times where you need to know what you're doing you need to understand that the hard work and the hard effort that i'm putting in is going to reap benefits in the future you may not see it now but you you looking for the harvest not for not for the seeds that you planted in the ground and so he said and just thinking about it sometimes we do god the same way lord i'm expecting big blessings but i'm not praying i'm not reading my bible i'm not fasting i'm not trying to get closer to you i can barely make it to church sometimes but i'm expecting god you to do x y and z for me because you said that you was going to do it and god said where's your effort where where is where's do you you got to you got to do something you got to put in the effort to show forward that i can trust you he in the story in the bible he gave there's a story where jesus told the parable where he gave one man five talents one man three times and one man one talent the one with five when doubled his talents the one with three win doubled his talent but the one with one he went and buried his talent and said lord i knew that you were a hard master so i didn't want to lose it and the lord came back and he he took his talent and gave it to the one with five and said because he knew what to do with it he was putting forth the effort he said even if i lose i'm gonna win even if i lose lord i may win i might lose out on some friends i might lose out on some some things of doing in this life but if even if i lose i'm going to win i'm going to make it all i want to do is make it lord and if i got to lose a few things over here to make it lord take him away lord search me o god and try my reins lord amen you're looking and you say david said that that lord i want you to search me lord create me a clean heart oh lord and renew a right spirit and means and you're looking lord i want to put forth the effort lord not not just giving the faith but giving the effort for it lord i know that you can you you do what you said you can do now i got to do what you told me to do he said pick up your cross and follow me and the cross is not a light thing it was not a light piece piece of wood that you had to carry up a hill but he said pick up your cross and follow me that meant that whatever what whatever you was he was going to give you you was going to have to work for it you was going to have to make some sacrifices you was gonna make some you was gonna have to do do some things to make it yeah it wasn't gonna be he said my yoke is easy but my burden is light so if you get he said that he was you were gonna get these things but then you have to turn them over and give it to him amen and i wrote down something else he said said right now um whatever you're going through sometimes it's only a test it's only a test and when you know that it's just a test it'll change your attitudes towards the situation it'll change how you react to the situation because you realize lord you're only building my character god you're only taking me through to show me where i am sometimes god gotta take you through something to show you you need to pray more you need to study more you need to get get closer to me you you ain't where you think you are and and god god shows us these things in life and it's like lord are we listening are we paying heed so that we don't lose our faith in you we don't we don't we don't we realize that these things are only a test the end goal is to make it in lord everything that i do lord i want it to be pleasing to you so when i get to in front of you lord i want to hear well done good and faithful servant enter into my rest and lord in just understanding lord whatever i do i want to put the works behind it to push forward because it's all about how you respond it's all about how you respond to to any situation you look at abraham in the bible abraham waited 25 years for the thing that god had promised him and then later on when when isaac got a little bit older god sent abraham and told him to go sacrifice him and it looked counterintuitive but abraham he didn't lose faith in god he saw what god had done so far so he said so he went and he went he took he took eyes and a few servants and they went on a journey they went on the journey to a mountain and he left the servants at the base of the mountain and isaac asked him once they got there he said where's the sacrifice abraham said the lord will provide he didn't tell him what what the plan was and then when he got up there he laid the altar out and he he got ready and then he tied isaac and put him on the altar and was getting ready to to to take him out and the lord stayed his hand and and sent a ram in the bush to sacrifice on on that altar abraham it was about how he responded to the things that he was going through he didn't lose faith in god because it was a test on the trial he didn't lose faith in god because it seemed it seemed absurd to the natural man he didn't lose his faith he he responded in the right way uh and the prophet of god he said and he was talking about the story of moses and he said god took moses in the backside of the desert and he had to teach him and he said he said and god called the man that was moses but moses was a great deal like us every time we come to a place to something had to be done moses every time we come to a place just something had to be done moses called out oh lord what must i do in this place now isn't that just like we do god had blessed him and anointed him above his brother and given him a message in a ministry that had not been on the earth since that day until that day and yet every time something taken place moses run off to god with the lord what must i do what must i do in this case god kind of got kind of a tired of it i believe and said why are you crying to me speak to the people and go forward my if any time ever look like they ought to retreat was man but god has no retreat any time ever looked like they ought to retreat was then but god has no retreat sometimes you you're going through life and you're facing certain things and look like i should be going back but god doesn't retreat he goes there's no place to retreat in god go forward the doctor says it's cancer go forward if he says it's tb go for it if the devil says you can't give this up go for it if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic go for it the church turns you out go for it there's no retreating back go for it speak and go forward sometimes you got to get to that place lord i gotta go forward i'm tired of getting knocked back and knocked down and situations coming at me from all which ways lord i gotta go forward i wanna put in the time put in the effort to go forward lord lord push me forward lord lead and guide me and lord let me speak your word he says speak what speak his word go forth thus saith the lord and move on you got to go forward in god you want to make that logical you want to make that transition lord lord lead me forward lord guide me god in my footsteps and lord don't let me lose faith in you let me get stronger let me focus on you more lord let me take the time lord to get closer to you lord i want to move forward i want to take steps forward lord in you so i may see you one day lord jesus lord i may not be where i thought i ought to be but lord let me move forward let me put more time lord into prayer let me take more time in the fashion lord let me get closer to you lord each and every day lord let me read my bible more lord jesus let me do the things that i need to do to get closer lord lord push me forward let's let's go forward let's go forward as a church you see the signs of the times and the things that are happening in the world and you see the time is getting shorter and shorter and we got to we got to be preparing to go somewhere we got to be preparing to get our life in order to go somewhere lord push me forward let's go forward in god let's not lose our faith let's not give up hope let's go on and let's let's cry out for the ones that are falling by the way because god is the one that can bring them back because this is only a test you don't know what your prayers could be doing for someone else keeping them helping them pushing them forward and god continue to put that hedge around them that the devil don't take them all the way lord jesus lord let me push forward let me go forward let me lord let me ask you for direction lord lead and guide me lord jesus so that i can see you lord jesus said lord i want to go forward i want to speak for speak things and see that they are lord speak claim lives back claim people back claim victory back in my life lord jesus lord i want to go forward lord no more by the side no more wasting time because lord i i on my job one time they made us do a time study and where you're supposed to report everything that you do while you're working every 15 minutes you know what that showed me i wasted a lot of time i waste a lot of time and i said sometimes how much more time would i have if i just looked at how much time i'm wasting and spent five percent more doing something that was productive what would i be able to achieve lord what would i be able to do what would you be able to use me for if i spend five percent more time letting you allowing you to use me being on one accord with you spend five percent more time praying instead of watching things and doing different things listening to things lord if i spend 10 10 to 15 minutes more praying than i do right now what would you what would the impact be on my life what would the impact be on someone else's life what would the impact be if if sometimes i said we need to be prayer champions you think of a game that you may be playing sometimes you're on level one and level and there's different levels to a game and and you see the person that wins it all they become a champion and says sometimes lord i want to become a prayer champion i want to be someone lord that that i reach my heart when i reached my highest level you find me on my knees you find me there listening lord trying to figure out your direction for my life lord you find me there praying for your people you find me there lord interceding for your people and lord we want to be able to push forward and go forward in you lord and don't lose hope and don't lose faith in you amen [Applause] appreciate the word tonight amen don't lose faith amen you know i was uh ministering on sunday be it unto me according to thy word you know i said one thing is you know about it's the way you look at the situation i says you know the way you look at the situation to change the whole thing i said you know that first one that angel came to mary and he began to give her a salutation one of the first things he began to tell her he says that you blessed and highly favored i says what it is mary might not even been known to anybody in the world at the time but her family and the people around her but yet when the angels seen the first thing he told her you blessed and you highly favored and i believe that you know that might have caused her to look at herself a little different come on and nobody don't know who i am but the lord he said i'm blessed and highly favored so i began to think about that and dwell on that a little bit i said come on and no matter what you're going through in life right now no matter what you're faced with right now i said to be here with blood running warm in your veins come on i said when when you think about all your good days and i was telling my mom it was coming up she was telling me some things and you know it was on a heart and all i said yeah i said but you know you think about those bad days i said but think about those good days come on i said and those good days like that song says they outweigh all of the bad come on and i said you got something to praise god about you know that angel i said like i said it might have startled her but he said you blessed in highly favored but her question was you know as the brother caleb who knows preaching on don't lose faith her question was was lord how can this be and he began to tell her he said he says the holy ghost gonna overshadow you and that thing that's gonna come from you is gonna be you know a blessing you know we know the scriptures and all and then but her reply was well lord be it unto me come on according to your word and i said that's what we got to start when we look at the word of god that way not looking at oh how's it going how is this going to happen no we ain't looking at it that way what we're saying god be it unto me come on i say if you challenge with a sickness tonight what what is it oh the doctor might have said this about it and that and they might have said we got to do this to repair this oh but come on but the word of god says that he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him i said sometimes you know we're living in a world where we have all those restless nights and we got a lot of things on our mind but don't you know that when he went up to calvary he was whip wounded and all these things the chastisement of our peace was upon them and he says they that keep their mind on him he'll keep him at what perfect peace come on and as he says that with his stripes you are healed come on and that's what he says so no matter what the report is come on be it unto me according to thy word oh lord i started looking at certain blessings and certain things that god said about us and i said what it is be it unto me i said be it unto you tonight according to the word of god why because the thing is it ain't it's it's the way we change in the way we're looking at the situation as our brother caleb was saying you're changing we're changing the way we're looking at it not that oh i can't do it but we're more than able you know it's kind of striking because brother caleb went to joshua one that's what me and the children been reading all week long is the book of joshua and going over how you know howdy says that hey and and caleb was going over how he was talking about when they went to spy out the land how there was walls cities in the land and all these things and but even though they were all that in the land joshua and caleb eyes wasn't looking at none of that was it it was looking at a god that brought them this far it's more than able to take them the rest of the way so what do we look at tonight come on a god that brought us this far i don't know the brother of him was telling me tonight 50 years he coming up on i said god brought you a long way didn't he and he's still blessing you a god that brought you this far come on it ain't nothing that we've never seen before come on the bible says that that which has been that which is nice already been come on ain't nothing new under the sun the same god that whipped the devil back then is the same god that's going whip them right now how many believe that the same god that opened the red sea is the same god that's gonna open doors right now the same god that healed that said i'm the lord that god that healeth thee that heals it in he gonna heal you right now why because he said i'm the lord and i change not he's the same yesterday what today and forever now be it unto me come on according to thy word this it's how and that's why he says don't lose your faith it's how you look at the same situation saints come on that same god he's that same god i was thinking about david and how you know the bible says that when when the champion goliath come on when he came out boasting everybody was afraid of him wasn't he shaking in their boots wasn't it but what about this little boy was the difference he was looking at a situation different wasn't he he wasn't looking at that giant but he was looking at god was with me back there in the wilderness come on i know what the supernatural is like and i know that i am incapable in myself but when he comes hallelujah i say when the spirit of god comes that's all i want so what do we do we're standing here saying lord we're waiting on you come on i know the situation is hard i know the mountain seems too high to climb but what is it lord i'm waiting on you god because when you come i know that the situation is gonna be taken care of everything's gonna be all right when my guards show up hallelujah he said he said come on put this armor on he said i ain't proved that yet come on somebody giving you all kind of ways out well maybe the lord are doing this so maybe we can do this and and come on but i ain't proved that yet hallelujah but what did you prove when i got down on my knees i know that prayer works i know that when i
