worship leader and musicians we appreciate everybody the ones that cleans and does the things that folk don't see thank God for them amen all of those on that label with us in the gospel we certainly appreciate each and every one of you amen when one miss amen we certainly amen miss you keep pressing the battle everyone 21 24 and 21 it says for then shall there be Great Tribulation such as not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should what no flesh be saved but for the what for the elect sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you Lo his Christ are there believe it not for there shall be there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the what very elect may God bless the reading this word you may be seated and we want to go back here to the 22nd verse except those days be shorten there shall no flesh be saved I believe those days are here I believe we have come to those days that we are the world is in such a turmoil and such a condition that we can come to the time where it can get so bad that if God didn't have mercy there would be no flesh save are you with me but he says but for the what that's what I want to talk about this morning for the elect sake and I want to say for your sake for your sake for the elect sake I want to speak to each and every one of us that you and I that are here this morning and those that are listening father the elect s when I speak of the elect it means those that were picked out in other words those that are chosen we like to elaborate father upon those that are elect those that are chosen not just because we go to church not what because we identify with a certain persuasion but we must identify with the word and what the word has identified as those that are elect we must look and see whether or not we can identify ourselves with the word when he speaks of elect you can say is he talking about me just as much as Mary knew that Isaiah 17 Isaiah 7:14 was talking about her and John knew that Isaiah 40 was talking about him the voice of one crying in the wilderness and those on the day of Pentecost could identify with said this is that which is spoken of by the prophet Joel then the elect must also be clearly identified those that was picked out those that were chosen because we're talking about the shortening of the days for the elect sake so interchanging that word elect and chosen because elect means to be chosen we know that John tells us that Jesus said you have not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordain you that you should go forth and that you should bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain so for the elect sake amen I'm so glad that God chose me how about you you know when I was uh praying and God taking me through this the scripture First Peter 1 1 and four I might start at the third verse 1 Peter 1 I was thinking about how blessed I am and how blessed we are I mean we have nothing to hold our heads down for we must walk with the uh I might use the word pride but I a word bless how blessed we are we can walk with our heads up knowing that God has truly blessed us and that we are the elect of God and God I I it doesn't matter if you're going through sickness you're going through crisis it doesn't matter but Paul testify I let nothing separate me from the love of God that I found in Christ amen I know what it's all about amen I I I'm elect so I I'll let nothing separate me because I know that I'm elect see I know what God has done for me and I know what he's doing for me even now amen so many Christian when they even face death they were not afraid because they had already passed from Death To Life amen they knew that death could not harm them death was already taken care of are you with me so a Christian knowing that they are are the elect of God chosen of God Amen not only just identifying as a Christian because we know that the church consists of five wise and five foolish amen but to be amen the elect of God and be the bride that call out of the church amen not just to be in the church where God calls a bride out the church amen as my own Bishop used to say he called the church out of the church so he calls the bride out of the church amen and many people amen going to identify amen as being amen the uh uh the bridegroom Comet and there's a Midnight Cry amen and many people going to rise up and try to come but they'll find out they don't have all there's no translation power amen there's nothing to change them amen praise God so when the bridegroom cometh they going to find they running short of all brother and sister don't run short of all brother here we are at this end time uh I said first Peter 2 excuse me 1 Peter 2 I said 1 Peter one let's verse one and four let's go to uh two and four two and four first pet 2 and four it says to whom come unto a Lively Stone a living Stone this allowed indeed of men but what now somebody says the elect of [Music] God is is because of his grace not human will but the grace of God Amen you are the elect of God Amen by the grace of God not what we've done but what he's done are you with me and not what we can do amen he that began a good work in us he's able to completed he's able to finish what he started if God start out and he saved us then God can complete the full job if you couldn't do anything to save yourself but by his grace he saved us then Grace will carry us all away Grace can complete the full job are you with me so brother and sister don't get in Grace way Grace don't let him get get in your way Grace I got two Grace in here okay so don't don't let nothing get in Grace way amen let Grace carry you all the way amen because Grace has rest started the work let Grace finish it so don't start boasting or bragging about what You' have done or what you can do because we can do nothing for he said without me you can do oh yes so here we are as we journey through this he says but he chose but chosen of God you're precious brother and sister isn't that lovely that you precious somebody said precious is in the sight of the Lord is the death of one of his Saints but you are precious isn't that right so uh he said ye also as Lively stones are built up a what a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer what spiritual sacrifice is acceptable to God by Jesus Christ brother and sister just think about the elect of God for the elect sake and what God has afforded you and I what God has given you and I amen then we ought to offer sacrifices Lord I love you thank you Lord it's no pain there no sorrow it's nothing that we could go through amen that could uh drown the love of God out no fire can't burn it water can't drown it hallelujah oh yes amen what God has given us it outweighs amen all of our pains all of our sorrows all of our troubles all of our disappointment what God is giv us it excels all of that it supersedes everything amen because what God has us amen given us is his agape love his Spirit his life that amen causes us to live in him we live we move and we have our beings it because he live I live oh yes oh God is good to us amen hallelujah oh I'm on my way to heaven and join my trip amen he says that spiritual house holy priesthood off for Spiritual sacrifice acceptable God by Jesus Christ sixth verse says wherefore also it is contained in scriptures Behold our l in Zion a Chief Cornerstone what elect and what
