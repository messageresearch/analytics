[35:45] you have your bibles
[35:48] turn with me to the book of acts
[36:01] acts one
[36:10] i want to read maybe one or two
[36:11] scriptures there and then we want to go
[36:12] to the book of second corinthians
[36:16] 11.
[36:18] the book of acts
[36:26] nine through eleven
[36:31] and when he had spoken these things
[36:35] while they behold he was taken up
[36:39] any cloud received him out of their
[36:41] sight
[36:43] and while they looked steadfast toward
[36:45] heaven
[36:46] as he went up behold two men stood by
[36:49] them in white apparel
[36:52] which also said yemen of galilee
[36:56] why stand thee gazing up into heaven
[37:00] and that's why i wanna drop our thought
[37:02] this same jesus
[37:04] which is taken up from you into heaven
[37:08] shall so come in like manner and you
[37:11] have seen him
[37:12] go into heaven i'm gonna go ahead and
[37:15] pray and let you be seated then we go to
[37:16] the book of second corinthians father
[37:19] god we thank you for your word tonight
[37:21] god may your blessed
[37:22] sanctified quicken it in jesus name amen
[37:26] let me recede it
[37:28] and turn with me to the book of second
[37:30] corinthians
[37:32] remember i want to draw my thoughts from
[37:34] acts
[37:36] 1 11
[37:37] this same jesus
[37:41] not another jesus but this same jesus
[37:46] acts 11
[37:47] second excuse me second corinthians
[37:51] 11
[37:56] 2-4
[37:58] for i am jealous over you with godly
[38:01] jealous
[38:02] if i have a spouse you to one husband
[38:06] that i may present you as the chaste
[38:08] virgin to christ
[38:10] but i fear at least by any means
[38:13] as the serpent begal eve
[38:16] through his septility so your mind
[38:19] should be corrupt from the simplicity i
[38:22] like that
[38:23] the simplicity that is in christ
[38:26] for if he that cometh preaches another
[38:29] jesus
[38:30] whom we have not mispreached
[38:33] or if you receive another spirit
[38:35] which you have not received or another
[38:37] gospel
[38:39] which ye have not accepted ye might bear
[38:44] with him amen
[38:47] i'll say tonight i wanted you for
[38:50] a little thought just for a few minutes
[38:52] tonight
[38:54] and it was something that i was kind of
[38:57] sharing speaking down marion
[39:00] to the saints there and it was just
[39:04] my reading the weekend just kind of just
[39:06] stuck out to me
[39:08] and i began just to think about you know
[39:12] this same jesus
[39:15] this same jesus and paul here
[39:19] had picked it up
[39:21] you know and said
[39:23] uh several places through the scripture
[39:24] i'm not going to turn to galatians and
[39:27] first corinthians and
[39:29] different places in here
[39:32] and if you notice the bible
[39:34] the disciples
[39:37] they had one focus that they were
[39:39] pointing the people to
[39:43] i remember i thought about paul as he
[39:47] was in that religious system
[39:51] going about persecuting
[39:55] the early christians the church of that
[39:57] day
[39:59] and paul was a very staunch
[40:03] man that
[40:05] really didn't play
[40:08] with what he believed he was sincere
[40:13] he was dedicated
[40:16] to what he had been taught or what he
[40:18] had believed
[40:21] and paul went out carrying
[40:24] threatens and
[40:26] consenting even to stiffen death
[40:30] but one day
[40:32] something happened to saul
[40:36] while he was on his road to do another
[40:38] one of his religious
[40:40] uh duties
[40:44] amen and like i said we have a lot of
[40:46] sincere people
[40:49] but a lot of times you can be sincerely
[40:52] wrong
[40:55] and paul was one of those people that
[40:59] really was taught upon the gamaya one of
[41:02] the
[41:03] chief
[41:04] renowned men of that day
[41:07] and he had letters
[41:10] to go and uh
[41:12] carry out
[41:15] religious duties that
[41:17] his uh
[41:19] church he was affiliated with
[41:22] but he meant something along the way
[41:29] he met something that he wasn't
[41:32] expecting to meet
[41:34] amen amen
[41:37] and that something
[41:39] caused paul to be smitten
[41:42] blind
[41:45] and
[41:46] paul
[41:48] no doubt didn't know what hit him
[41:54] he fell down the beginning say who art
[41:56] thou lord amen
[42:00] and that voice spoke out saying i am
[42:02] jesus
[42:06] i like the way that voice when it comes
[42:09] and i want you to notice this if that
[42:12] any other voice that you hear not
[42:14] pointing you to jesus christ it's the
[42:17] wrong voice
[42:22] god
[42:24] saw the paul's heart
[42:27] he had chosen song
[42:31] to be a vessel
[42:34] but before god could use them paul god
[42:37] had to do something
[42:41] and i believe each and every one of us
[42:43] and we've been going our separate way
[42:46] one day something happened
[42:49] we were going about our careers we were
[42:51] going about our lives we've been going
[42:53] by doing different things but there was
[42:55] something that happened in our life
[42:59] and we had to look up
[43:02] to find out what wasn't going on
[43:05] and then you heard a voice
[43:10] and i want to tell you something that
[43:12] voice that you heard
[43:14] if you really ever heard that voice of
[43:17] god you can never be the same again
[43:23] you will never out you may not
[43:26] understand it you may can't explain it
[43:30] but it's something if it's god it'll
[43:33] cause something to happen in
[43:38] you i can never forget
[43:43] i could never forget
[43:46] because that day scene i believe that
[43:50] every one of us in particular
[43:53] you must meet that voice
[43:59] and that voice has a name
[44:04] one name the bible said in acts there is
[44:07] no
[44:08] other name given amongst men whereby you
[44:12] must
[44:14] be saved
[44:18] i'll be another player it said that god
[44:20] had had highly exalted him and given him
[44:25] a name above
[44:27] every name
[44:31] oh my
[44:33] no wonder people don't want to preach in
[44:35] that name
[44:38] god in this hour came and restored the
[44:41] truth
[44:42] the revelation of that name
[44:45] amen
[44:46] and he's showing the light on it and let
[44:49] us know that it's not three persons the
[44:52] one god but it's one guard with three
[44:56] attributes
[44:57] [Music]
[44:58] father above us
[45:01] son on earth
[45:02] in the holy ghost he's sent back to the
[45:04] church
[45:07] one god
[45:10] same in character
[45:12] same in power
[45:15] same in word
[45:18] same in life
[45:21] not two different standards
[45:24] one life
[45:26] one god one faith one baptism
[45:32] and under that name the bible say
[45:35] devils tremble
[45:41] the very purpose of
[45:43] this end time revelation god sent with
[45:46] us restore the truth
[45:49] because in the dark age of history they
[45:52] lost this light
[45:56] it got so bad the way there was doing
[45:59] all kinds of things in other people's
[46:01] names
[46:04] and god wouldn't identify himself with
[46:07] nothing else but his name
[46:12] that's why in matthew he said go ye into
[46:15] all the world and preach the gospel
[46:18] baptizing them in the name of
[46:24] he particular in a n-a-m-e
[46:29] what was he doing there's only
[46:31] one name i'm gonna recognize
[46:38] but the people that they seem to
[46:42] want to give the people
[46:44] a different name
[46:50] and in that name
[46:54] if it's not jesus christ the lord jesus
[46:56] christ
[47:00] though there may be a lot of good names
[47:02] in the earth
[47:05] that does have authority with it
[47:08] but there's no other power
[47:12] given the most men that you can be saved
[47:16] on
[47:20] the bible say in the early church to say
[47:22] they will call christians
[47:27] not a name like we got today in a
[47:29] different denominational systems
[47:32] but chris it was a universal church
[47:40] and god
[47:41] wanted them to to to be in unity under
[47:46] his spirit
[47:48] and get back to that one name
[47:56] that's why i was telling people i said
[47:58] that
[47:59] listen
[48:01] we're not pointing the people to the
[48:03] real source of life we failed
[48:08] as ministers depart the people to the
[48:11] real person
[48:14] not the one that
[48:16] came with the myth but the one that gave
[48:18] the message
[48:21] and the message was already written
[48:27] in the bible the bible said all
[48:29] scripture is given by inspiration by god
[48:37] and god let the truth of his word
[48:40] throughout every age to be made known to
[48:43] the people that were living in that
[48:45] particular generation
[48:52] but oh in that name
[48:55] there's deliverance
[48:58] there's healing in that name
[49:04] i like it in john and say in the
[49:06] beginning was the word
[49:10] see in the beginning was the word
[49:13] the word was with god and the word was
[49:16] god
[49:19] another place we typically say great is
[49:21] the mystery of god god was
[49:26] see paul said the simplicity of the
[49:29] gospel
[49:31] see that's what make god so great
[49:35] because he comes so
[49:38] low and he hid himself in a vessel body
[49:43] called jesus christ
[49:46] and the very people that should knew who
[49:50] he was they said who is this
[49:55] why because he didn't come under their
[49:59] affiliation name
[50:02] but he came outside of every
[50:06] religious affiliation of that hour
[50:09] but he was the living
[50:12] representation of god in flesh
[50:17] reconciling the world back to himself
[50:23] everywhere jesus went he took no credit
[50:26] for him he said i can do
[50:28] nothing
[50:32] except my father showed me
[50:38] what a wonderful name that is
[50:42] a name
[50:45] sometimes i know he
[50:47] i say i do
[50:50] sometimes you can get so heavy
[50:56] burning down with things and
[50:59] you may not even find the words to pray
[51:02] but if you said oh jesus
[51:06] amen oh my
[51:09] dear late night album when everybody
[51:11] else was sleeping god wake you up and
[51:14] you begin to just you know go somewhere
[51:17] on your knees all you can say is jesus
[51:20] jesus
[51:25] you know i believe that early people at
[51:28] pentecost when they tear it though they
[51:30] have the maybe a little
[51:32] not clear to him but something happened
[51:35] to some of those people
[51:38] every day we can mark them that that
[51:41] wasn't it let me tell you something some
[51:43] of them live way better than we do
[51:47] with all the truth we got
[51:50] they met the person
[51:53] they met god and god made himself
[51:57] visible to them from that day they'll
[52:00] tell you i can never be the same again
[52:07] i wish we could get some of that
[52:11] the end time message people
[52:16] because we're missing something
[52:19] we've carried the people in all kind of
[52:22] isms
[52:24] and god said no no i don't recognize
[52:27] no other name than the name of the lord
[52:29] jesus christ
[52:31] that's where i put my approval
[52:34] you may call buddha and all kind of
[52:36] other names but god don't even pay
[52:38] attention to that
[52:40] amen
[52:42] he looking for his name
[52:46] that's why when you receive the holy
[52:48] ghost
[52:50] oh you just don't know what you have in
[52:53] your possession
[52:54] [Music]
[52:56] oh but the devil know
[52:59] you might not fully understand what you
[53:02] have but when it does click when it does
[53:05] or be made known revealed to you
[53:09] you understand that
[53:11] as jesus said when he went to the hell
[53:14] and he wrote he said all power
[53:20] in other words he realized what he had
[53:23] he understood even death couldn't hold
[53:26] his body down
[53:29] that's why
[53:30] death
[53:31] can't hold you down
[53:36] the devil used to torment us about it
[53:40] now we understood that listen
[53:43] that's not the end of it
[53:45] because if that same spirit dwell in you
[53:50] he will quicken your mortal body
[53:56] all it does is is change your dwelling
[54:00] place
[54:03] and it must be chained one way or the
[54:05] other
[54:08] but in that name
[54:11] there's so much power
[54:14] in that name
[54:17] why people don't want to call his name
[54:20] don't you know when you call anybody
[54:22] else's name more than you call jesus
[54:24] christ's name god is the jealous god
[54:29] come on god is jealous
[54:31] and we say he said i'll spouse you to
[54:34] one husband
[54:36] come on don't cut don't tell me that uh
[54:38] what we got going today no no no
[54:40] jesus christ is your husband amen
[54:46] paul begin to set that new testament
[54:50] into particular because paul already
[54:52] needs it now after my departure
[54:54] he said our grievous wolves
[54:57] preachers
[54:59] were going to come in and begin to
[55:01] scatter you
[55:03] here he said that to speak perverse
[55:05] things
[55:07] turning you from the lord jesus christ
[55:10] to somebody else
[55:13] but god wanted his hour get back to the
[55:16] word
[55:18] amen get back to your husband
[55:24] oh my
[55:26] i'll tell you the truth
[55:28] let me read something else quote me to
[55:30] the book of galatians
[55:36] that same jesus
[55:38] let me tell you something that the same
[55:40] jesus is right here tonight
[55:44] see people are looking for him there
[55:46] looking for him young he said what you
[55:48] looking for he said no no he's not there
[55:53] people looking for jesus in some a
[55:55] certain church or a certain place
[55:58] what you look at he said here i am right
[56:00] here i'm right here in my word
[56:05] see when jesus came
[56:07] he was the living reality of the word
[56:13] for that particular hour
[56:17] god had hid himself
[56:21] in a body called jesus
[56:25] and didn't even know that that was god
[56:27] on earth
[56:30] walking amongst them
[56:33] he did every work
[56:35] everything the scripture spoke of him
[56:38] jesus made it manifest
[56:42] [Music]
[56:44] and he never that's what i like about uh
[56:47] you know somebody at home but they never
[56:49] take credit for anything
[56:53] you can't take credit for nothing but
[56:56] you can pardon god damn it
[57:00] how did you made it through it was god
[57:03] brought me through
[57:05] how do you make it through what you're
[57:07] going through god done it
[57:13] paul said i am what i am by the grace of
[57:15] god
[57:18] you know what i know in this hour
[57:21] the yellow song said i can't even walk
[57:24] except you hold my hand
[57:27] let me tell you the older you get you
[57:29] understand that a little better
[57:31] you can't even get up
[57:34] except god gets you up
[57:37] you can't even
[57:38] talk except god give you a voice to talk
[57:43] you can't even breathe
[57:45] if god don't give a breath of life
[57:48] [Music]
[57:50] if i was whatever you're doing word or
[57:51] deed do it in what
[57:54] oh yeah
[57:56] whatever you get whatever god bless you
[57:58] with thank god for your mercy
[58:02] i don't have nothing to boast of my own
[58:04] god but i thank you for your grace
[58:10] amen for the girl to say that song
[58:15] all that belongs to you
[58:18] all of the glory
[58:20] oh not some all
[58:23] all that you are it belongs to him
[58:27] all what you have is because of him all
[58:31] that you have going to have is because
[58:34] of him
[58:36] all that you are
[58:39] it's not your marriage
[58:41] but it's the grace of god in your life
[58:44] that's why we all walk in such a
[58:46] humility
[58:48] of the grace of god because we have been
[58:51] privileged people
[58:54] oh my god
[58:56] we have been privileged
[58:59] people to be partakers
[59:03] of this heavenly gift
[59:06] that god has given to you
[59:10] now he could have given to anybody else
[59:15] oh god but i thank you
[59:17] that you didn't pass me by lord
[59:20] god i thank you you saw fit as wretched
[59:23] and undone as i have god you saw fit
[59:29] to give somebody like
[59:32] [Music]
[59:35] look what kind of people we were
[59:38] i was telling the church back home
[59:40] marrying called home
[59:42] and i was telling i say you know
[59:44] if you understand the birth of jesus
[59:47] where he was born at
[59:49] he was born in one of the lowest
[59:52] places that a baby could be born
[59:56] it wasn't a pretty hospital roses
[59:59] but it was a stable actually like a cave
[1:00:02] where they kept animals
[1:00:06] cow
[1:00:08] were in there it was it stunk in here
[1:00:13] but that's where our king went to be
[1:00:16] born
[1:00:18] why did he went so low look at it again
[1:00:21] he was hiding himself in this you know
[1:00:25] kings don't be born that way
[1:00:28] they be born in some place that royal
[1:00:31] but not no not god he went to the lowest
[1:00:35] you know why because we were so low
[1:00:39] and he wanted to identify
[1:00:42] with us how low we were yet he came down
[1:00:47] to see about us
[1:00:51] sister shaw let's say it makes me want
[1:00:54] to shout
[1:00:57] when i think about
[1:01:00] all
[1:01:02] that he's done for us
[1:01:05] when i think about how low he
[1:01:08] went
[1:01:10] he went uh or did
[1:01:13] that nobody else would do amen
[1:01:17] and he did it oh
[1:01:19] how he must love us
[1:01:24] and he demonstrated that because you
[1:01:27] were on my mind i'm not going to lose
[1:01:30] you
[1:01:32] i know you may be messed up i know you
[1:01:34] got a laughing in your life but i went
[1:01:37] to the lowest
[1:01:39] to be born in a stinking manger
[1:01:44] for you
[1:01:49] what kind of love is that
[1:01:51] what kind of love is that bro
[1:01:54] that's love for that song saying that's
[1:01:56] love
[1:01:58] come on he he hung his head
[1:02:01] he was script
[1:02:04] beaten
[1:02:06] not because of what he did because he
[1:02:08] done nothing
[1:02:10] now he became sin
[1:02:13] not that he was but he became for us
[1:02:16] what was he doing he was taking our
[1:02:19] place
[1:02:22] oh my
[1:02:23] and then people turn down this great
[1:02:27] grace of god
[1:02:30] because they don't fully understand what
[1:02:33] calvary meant to them
[1:02:36] what it meant
[1:02:38] you were made free
[1:02:41] the penalty that we were under he said i
[1:02:46] come to lift that off of you and you
[1:02:49] don't have to do that no more
[1:02:53] i wish the world could really catch this
[1:02:57] okay not something high
[1:03:00] but it's simple amen what happened has
[1:03:03] that the religious people
[1:03:07] have really
[1:03:08] made this gospel some
[1:03:11] weakened down
[1:03:13] thing as some social
[1:03:17] but no don't let them do that to you
[1:03:20] let me tell you something because what
[1:03:21] he did
[1:03:23] it was great
[1:03:26] do it was free it cost something
[1:03:30] it caused a life
[1:03:33] to be laid down
[1:03:35] for us
[1:03:37] that's why you don't take this for
[1:03:39] granted
[1:03:41] you know you cherish
[1:03:44] yes you may have some time the way
[1:03:47] things get low but when i think about
[1:03:50] the goodness of god and all he is done
[1:03:54] for you
[1:03:59] lord have mercy
[1:04:02] i see why the sovereign god said he said
[1:04:04] we ought to be the most happiest
[1:04:07] people
[1:04:09] but we don't fully understand what we
[1:04:11] got
[1:04:13] but when you fully
[1:04:15] understand church that nothing can harm
[1:04:19] you
[1:04:19] [Music]
[1:04:21] ever god got your back
[1:04:25] no matter what you're going through no
[1:04:27] matter what you're dealing with god is
[1:04:29] your protector
[1:04:35] the book of hebrews 13 says jesus christ
[1:04:38] is
[1:04:40] the what the same
[1:04:45] i like that
[1:04:46] that's why if you sick come on god is a
[1:04:49] healer
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:04:52] he never lost the power
[1:04:55] come on we're not looking at some so
[1:04:56] some empty tune that we don't know no no
[1:04:59] no no no heroes
[1:05:03] and he didn't rules weak he wrote with
[1:05:05] all power
[1:05:08] the devil knew he never thought man if i
[1:05:11] would have known this is going to happen
[1:05:14] i may would have been your good body
[1:05:18] but i crossed off have you crucified
[1:05:21] figure that i was gonna be done with it
[1:05:24] oh my but in his death
[1:05:27] he conquered more in his life
[1:05:32] because in the earthly ministry he was
[1:05:34] on earth but when he died and rose again
[1:05:37] now everything over the whole earth
[1:05:40] was under his authority
[1:05:46] lord i wish i had
[1:05:48] voices
[1:05:50] galatians we're going to close
[1:05:57] you know
[1:05:58] i'm learning
[1:06:00] and i'm understanding i know right now
[1:06:04] we're in a cycle
[1:06:07] to where everything
[1:06:09] seemed to be going on
[1:06:12] and just one blow after the other
[1:06:16] one thing after another
[1:06:19] temperature seven i said he likes
[1:06:20] calling when i said are you tired as i
[1:06:22] am
[1:06:23] and you say a little
[1:06:26] because there's so much going on
[1:06:29] you can't keep up with what's going on
[1:06:32] and so what's going on all over the
[1:06:34] place
[1:06:36] i mean you wonder lord what's really
[1:06:38] going on
[1:06:40] but i understand one thing we got to
[1:06:42] make our call in our election
[1:06:44] sure i'll tell the people back home
[1:06:47] remember and i said listen if there's
[1:06:50] ever a day you want to know what you're
[1:06:52] doing is right by god and be sure you
[1:06:56] get a checkup
[1:06:59] and don't check your neighbor out check
[1:07:01] yourself
[1:07:04] we must examine our own self you got to
[1:07:08] know sister brother where i stand with
[1:07:12] you god
[1:07:13] do i have enough to make it through in
[1:07:16] this hour
[1:07:17] cause they're gonna take something more
[1:07:22] it's gonna take something more than just
[1:07:24] coming to church
[1:07:26] it's gonna take something more than just
[1:07:28] singing and clapping
[1:07:30] we got to have something that can anchor
[1:07:32] us
[1:07:34] because the storms are blowing
[1:07:37] and we're going to need an anchor that
[1:07:39] when that storm blow you might rock
[1:07:43] and you might lean
[1:07:46] but your soul is anchored
[1:07:49] and let me tell you something you don't
[1:07:51] hold the anchor but the anchor holds you
[1:07:58] this flesh we gotta want to give up
[1:08:03] because they go through so much
[1:08:06] sometimes sometimes people like to say
[1:08:10] what's the use it's like nothing seems
[1:08:12] to go
[1:08:14] let me tell you everything the server
[1:08:16] goes to everything is going exactly the
[1:08:19] way god intended for it
[1:08:23] he said nothing is out of care because
[1:08:25] god knows everything
[1:08:28] nothing is out of order we think this
[1:08:30] and that no no god got a purpose behind
[1:08:34] everything he allows to take place
[1:08:39] once you understand the purpose of god
[1:08:42] in your life you'll understand lord
[1:08:44] whatever you're doing in this season
[1:08:48] lord don't do it without me
[1:08:54] oh my
[1:08:57] i feel i feel i feel
[1:09:01] maybe i feel by myself
[1:09:05] but that's all right
[1:09:07] this is the individual journey anyhow
[1:09:11] and we're not so much about feeling but
[1:09:13] i know there's something going on
[1:09:17] it's later than we think be sure you got
[1:09:21] oil
[1:09:23] be sure you got oil
[1:09:26] and be sure you got enough because it
[1:09:27] might be then got a little low
[1:09:30] you need to get a double potion you need
[1:09:33] to get a a a re-uh dedication
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] i look at the bible days and i saw that
[1:09:40] after the pastor didn't have to see the
[1:09:42] holy ghost and then they start going
[1:09:44] through great persecution and things
[1:09:45] were going on in that hour you know what
[1:09:48] they did this pray lord we need another
[1:09:50] dose
[1:09:52] and the bible said the holy ghost came
[1:09:54] and it shook the place
[1:09:56] i wish that we could get that tonight
[1:10:00] i wish we could get that kind of mind
[1:10:03] that lord we are facing rebelling demon
[1:10:07] power lord we need another dose

[1:10:27] i'm not gonna even try to read it
[1:10:30] light us again
[1:10:33] we need a fire
[1:10:36] and not a painted fire but we need a
[1:10:38] fire you need your own fire amen amen
[1:10:42] come on we can't live off nobody else
[1:10:43] fought here no more
[1:10:45] we can't live off what god used to do
[1:10:47] and
[1:10:48] what he has done
[1:10:50] all the things that we make us say that
[1:10:53] the prophet is i would do that's good
[1:10:55] but where is yours
[1:10:59] yeah where is your
[1:11:02] testimony
[1:11:04] what has god been doing with us
[1:11:11] because it's not enough just to read
[1:11:12] what he used to do
[1:11:14] to remember the bible say hebrew jesus
[1:11:16] christ is
[1:11:18] so if he is
[1:11:20] he got to be doing something now
[1:11:23] come on let's get with it

[1:11:28] if he is the same what has he done for
[1:11:32] you
[1:11:35] that's what i want to know
[1:11:38] we don't even have testimony services
[1:11:40] let the people become seen that
[1:11:42] everybody see i'm going through
[1:11:45] you're supposed to
[1:11:49] but what god is doing
[1:11:51] he's trying to purge those things out of
[1:11:54] you
[1:11:56] the way you can get to the next level
[1:11:59] what is he doing he's beating all the
[1:12:02] drops
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:04] he's beating all of the arrogancy and
[1:12:07] the pride and and that fleshly and god
[1:12:11] will try to humble you so you can look
[1:12:14] up
[1:12:20] tonight
[1:12:22] appreciate you
