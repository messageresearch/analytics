[38:12] and try to teach a little bit or talk to
[38:14] you because i'm not good at teaching so
[38:18] y'all just pray for us amen
[38:21] it says
[38:23] in 1-13 in whom
[38:27] ye also trusted
[38:29] after that she heard the word of truth
[38:32] the gospel of your salvation
[38:35] in whom also after ye what
[38:38] after you believe you know as i said he
[38:42] said after you after you believe you
[38:44] were sealed with the holy spirit of
[38:46] promise
[38:47] now it's one thing the bible said he
[38:48] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[38:50] saved but he did believe it not shall be
[38:53] damned
[38:54] now after you believe
[38:56] he said have you
[38:58] i mean you were sealed
[39:01] amen
[39:02] so most of the religious world the
[39:04] christian world teaches that when you
[39:06] believe you have you're born again and
[39:08] you have this holy ghost
[39:11] but the bible teaches us in acts 19
[39:14] let's go back down just to bring
[39:16] everybody up to pass
[39:18] we're talking about the seal of god in
[39:20] the mark of the beast you realize that
[39:22] they're actually calling the mark that
[39:24] they put upon them that's what kept them
[39:27] from being destroyed
[39:29] but interchanging the mark that ezekiel
[39:32] is talking about
[39:33] with the seal think on it as the seal of
[39:36] god where god sees you amen
[39:39] god put his mark upon you or your life
[39:41] are you with me
[39:43] so i want you to look at um
[39:46] acts uh 19
[39:48] and i'll
[39:50] show you that the most
[39:51] of the people
[39:53] think that they're born again and think
[39:55] that they have the holy ghost because
[39:57] the preachers teach them that
[40:00] but it does not transform or change
[40:02] their life and neither do they have the
[40:04] power of the spirit
[40:06] because they're being taught that they
[40:08] have what they don't have
[40:10] are you with me
[40:12] you know
[40:13] sometimes folks tell you you got money
[40:15] in the bank and you go down to try to
[40:17] draw it out and you don't you don't have
[40:19] none
[40:20] so don't
[40:23] you know
[40:25] you don't want to try to go into heaven
[40:27] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:29] without being born again
[40:31] see john said except a man be born again
[40:33] he cannot what
[40:35] you can't see the kingdom and cannot
[40:37] enter into the kingdom of god isn't that
[40:39] right
[40:40] so you need to be born again
[40:42] as john said to nicodemus you must be
[40:45] born of water and of spirit
[40:48] are you with me
[40:49] not just the water but the water and the
[40:51] spirit okay
[40:53] so uh your your birth is not completed
[40:56] just
[40:57] doing one part you must have both
[41:01] be baptized in the water and you must
[41:03] receive the spirit
[41:05] so oftentimes people say i baptize you
[41:08] in the water
[41:09] in the name of the father son the holy
[41:11] ghost and say you got the spirit
[41:14] you understand but peter said repent and
[41:16] be baptized every one of you in the name
[41:18] of jesus christ for the remission of sin
[41:20] and you shall receive what
[41:23] the holy ghost not that you have it but
[41:25] you shall receive it
[41:27] are you with me
[41:29] okay so a lot of people tell you when
[41:32] you get baptized you have the spirit
[41:34] you're born again now you got to
[41:36] understand that
[41:38] the seal of god is the baptism of the
[41:40] holy ghost and we want to talk about
[41:42] sealing
[41:43] now you re your reason why
[41:46] mo a lot of people attitudes are so bad
[41:50] in why people are having difficult amen
[41:53] with christians because it's total
[41:55] there's so many christians that don't
[41:57] have the life because they have told
[41:59] them they're born again and they're not
[42:02] living nothing and and it's all right to
[42:04] do something anything
[42:06] the teacher you know it's all right to
[42:08] be a
[42:09] homosexual or whatever you say well
[42:11] you're born again
[42:13] it's all right you know to the living
[42:15] adultery you're born again you believe
[42:17] it you accept the jesus you know what
[42:19] i'm saying so uh being born again it's
[42:22] all right to take a drink and do this
[42:24] smoke you know do anything you're born
[42:27] again you're christian
[42:29] okay
[42:30] now
[42:32] born again i mean just believing and
[42:34] accepting jesus christ is just
[42:37] justification you accept what he's done
[42:39] for you amen it's not what you've done
[42:42] for yourself you're accepting and
[42:43] believing that jesus christ had died for
[42:46] your sin then to believe that and to
[42:49] take that first step but that's not a
[42:51] finished work
[42:53] and we're going to get to hopefully we
[42:55] get to the finishing work that god wants
[42:57] to he may do a complete a finished work
[43:00] in your life
[43:02] amen he just don't want to justify you
[43:04] he want to sanctify you and he wants you
[43:06] to fear you with the spirit
[43:08] are you with me
[43:09] so
[43:10] it's not enough just to start i you know
[43:13] i as i was meditating this morning and
[43:15] praying uh a god you know a lot of folk
[43:18] i i don't care how long they've been
[43:20] coming to church got to go deeper in
[43:22] christ
[43:23] a lot of times as a as a pastor i've
[43:26] seen of many folks over the years over
[43:29] 40 some odd years you know i i i've seen
[43:33] many people say well you know i got the
[43:35] holy ghost and i knew they needed a
[43:37] deeper touch i wasn't going to tell them
[43:39] you know discourage them i knew
[43:41] and then life goes on they might sit
[43:43] around and be in church faithfully for
[43:46] 20 years sometimes 30 years
[43:49] a long time then all of a sudden that
[43:51] man left his wife or the wife left her
[43:53] husband or whatever i
[43:56] all the time i i didn't want to
[43:57] discourage him because they was claiming
[44:00] they needed a deeper touch i call it a
[44:02] deeper touch
[44:04] you know and a lot of times people need
[44:06] a deeper touch and you can tell when
[44:08] their meanness come out of them
[44:12] you know every now and then they buzz
[44:14] off with the temple they get a little
[44:16] nasty attitude and stuff like that you
[44:18] know they need a deeper touch
[44:21] those kind of christians you can't tell
[44:23] them nothing
[44:24] because they're so spiritual and so holy
[44:27] so you can't correct them at all because
[44:29] they're going to correct you when you
[44:30] get through correcting them
[44:33] so they're going to tell you all your
[44:34] faults amen this is like the supervisor
[44:38] on the job trying to point out what he
[44:39] wants you to do and how he don't want
[44:41] you to do it and you turn around telling
[44:43] supervisor what they need to be doing
[44:47] how they need to be running the job you
[44:49] know what i'm saying and you got so many
[44:51] people that can do an expert job at what
[44:54] you do and they can tell you all
[44:59] you don't do that amen the bible says we
[45:02] don't measure ourselves by ourselves
[45:04] amen don't look at another man and try
[45:06] to say well because god might
[45:09] your problem and that personal problem
[45:11] might be a different problem
[45:13] amen when god is working on you you must
[45:16] let god work on you don't look at others
[45:19] and say well listen uh-uh you you let
[45:22] god work on you as an individual
[45:25] because your trial and my trial might
[45:27] not be the same trial
[45:29] what i'm struggling with and what i'm
[45:31] battling with may not be your battle at
[45:34] all
[45:35] that might be something that you're
[45:37] victorious but you can say well uh i can
[45:40] see yours but can you see your own
[45:43] because each and every one of us amen
[45:46] must come to maturity and let's come to
[45:48] perfection and we all are striving for
[45:50] the same thing god to perfect us in our
[45:53] lives each every one of us can look
[45:56] around oh i see this and i see that
[45:59] and all of us would be guilty
[46:01] amen but god looked at us through the
[46:03] blood like he looked at the israelis he
[46:05] said i see no iniquity in jacob
[46:07] as you know balaam tried to curse him
[46:09] amen god said blessed in the man whom
[46:12] the lord were not imputed nicodemy why
[46:14] because god looks beyond what you're
[46:17] seeing in the physical but god looked
[46:19] beyond amen he looked beyond david
[46:21] fought he said
[46:23] he saw david as a man after his own
[46:25] heart
[46:26] are you what man it doesn't matter how
[46:29] amen physically how he looked and all
[46:32] the
[46:33] terrible things he did but god looked at
[46:35] it amen differently
[46:38] and god showed because he's vindicated
[46:40] his life vet with so much supernatural
[46:44] so much of blessing that god continually
[46:46] saw that he was with david in spite of
[46:48] all his faults
[46:50] oh you would be
[46:52] so by the grace of god uh god amen when
[46:56] god's uh uh anointing individual for a
[46:59] particular thing amen nobody can say
[47:02] well
[47:03] why did why god you know god anoints
[47:07] whoever you you know peter
[47:09] looked like he was the fastest one
[47:11] cutting the man ear off with a swole and
[47:13] then cursing and swan and he didn't but
[47:15] god looked beyond peter temple and he
[47:18] saw that one day peter was going to come
[47:20] to the place where he need to be god
[47:22] looked beyond jacob with all his
[47:24] craftiness and know that jacob one day
[47:27] was gonna wrestle with the angel and
[47:29] gonna be a prince with god
[47:32] amen so that's what uh god looks
[47:35] sometimes amen and he sees amen he sees
[47:38] your end he sees uh what's in you he
[47:41] sees your amen hard
[47:43] sometimes we don't know amen so the best
[47:47] the thing is let's just pray one for
[47:49] another
[47:51] okay
[47:53] i'm going the 19 it says
[47:57] he says
[47:59] and he said unto them have you received
[48:01] the holy ghost since you believe
[48:03] now i i said you'll seal
[48:07] amen
[48:08] with the holy ghost
[48:10] after you believe now
[48:12] the ceiling comes after you believe
[48:15] this is what they say
[48:19] okay i'm gonna read it again in 1901 and
[48:22] it came to pass a while paul says that
[48:23] corinth paul having passed through the
[48:25] overthrows
[48:27] came to ephesus and finding certain
[48:28] disciples he said unto them have you
[48:30] received the holy ghost what
[48:33] believes that sense okay
[48:36] they said
[48:37] unto him we have not so much as her
[48:40] whether that be what
[48:42] any holy ghost
[48:44] and he said unto them until what then
[48:46] were you up
[48:48] baptized
[48:51] praise god
[48:52] now and they said unto what
[48:56] you know
[48:57] most of the baptists think john the
[48:59] baptist started their church
[49:02] and they said what
[49:04] they said unto john's baptism john
[49:06] baptized with the baptism look look what
[49:08] he said then said paul
[49:10] uh john verily baptized with the baptism
[49:13] where the repentance sentence the people
[49:16] that they should believe on him which
[49:17] should come after him that is on who
[49:21] christ jesus and when they heard this
[49:24] they were what
[49:27] lord jesus are you with me
[49:30] see they got baptized in the name of the
[49:32] lord jesus and then what happened
[49:34] did they were they born again did they
[49:36] have the holy ghost no this is what he
[49:38] said
[49:39] and when paul had what
[49:42] the holy ghost came on them and they
[49:45] what
[49:46] they speak with tongues and prophesied
[49:48] you know what i'm saying
[49:50] now tongues is not the evidence of the
[49:52] holy ghost amen but many people that
[49:54] received the holy ghost amen speak in
[49:57] tongues
[49:58] are you with me
[50:00] paul said i would that you all speak
[50:02] with tongues
[50:03] not that the tongues were the holy ghost
[50:06] the holy ghost is jesus christ amen
[50:09] it's the person of jesus christ in you
[50:11] amen
[50:13] so when jesus is in you he began to live
[50:16] his life through you
[50:18] are you with me
[50:19] see because a lot of people think that
[50:22] amen jesus is in them and
[50:24] and sometimes amen
[50:26] they got a little potion but they don't
[50:28] have the fullness of what they need to
[50:31] have and that's why people don't
[50:33] oftentimes they don't go deep enough
[50:35] they don't go farther enough in christ
[50:38] amen and sometimes you can't tell them
[50:41] nothing because they meant they've been
[50:43] serving the lord for 20 35 boy i've been
[50:48] serving the love for you were born
[50:52] and see what i'm saying how can you
[50:54] correct them how can you tell them you
[50:56] need a deeper touch sister brother you
[50:58] need a deeper touch
[51:00] are you with me
[51:01] but you just keep on believing god to
[51:04] touch them in a greater way
[51:06] sometimes it's on the deathbed
[51:08] for many people god gives them that
[51:11] deepness on their deathbed
[51:13] and uh because they come to a total
[51:16] surrendered place and sometimes some
[51:19] tragic happens in life till they realize
[51:22] i need more of god's
[51:24] situations come in life that cause
[51:26] people to become desperate sometimes
[51:28] sickness come in the body they get
[51:30] desperate with god they begin to yield
[51:32] itself fully to god and say god i need
[51:35] you now i need you more than i ever
[51:37] needed you before lord i'm not in the
[51:39] right place i realized amen i'm not as
[51:42] strong as i thought i was i'm not as you
[51:44] know i i'm not where i need to be and
[51:47] sometimes they begin to yawn in their
[51:49] spirit and cry to god it's only until
[51:51] those people get in those places do they
[51:54] realize amen i'm not where i need to be
[51:57] in god and sometimes i don't care how
[51:59] how much you cry and how much you come
[52:02] to the altar and how much you feel like
[52:04] you're repenting amen you still don't go
[52:07] far enough
[52:10] are you look man see sometimes amen it
[52:13] has to be sometimes we have to separate
[52:15] ourselves from all unbeliefs everything
[52:18] that's holding us back everything amen
[52:21] that we're doing amen that's not
[52:23] pleasing god we got to come to the point
[52:25] that we got to be willing to give it up
[52:28] and we want the seal of god in our life
[52:30] we want the baptism of the holy ghost we
[52:33] got to give up we got to come clean
[52:36] amen and and sometimes we're not willing
[52:38] to amen to
[52:40] give up all these things for the baptism
[52:42] of the holy ghost we're not willing to
[52:44] get surrender our whole life to god we
[52:47] we want to say lord i surrender all that
[52:50] i mean that's a good thought and a good
[52:52] saying amen but you can see the
[52:54] stubbornness and the rebellious in folks
[52:56] sometimes that said i surrender all amen
[53:00] you know sometimes people think amen
[53:02] that
[53:04] that i
[53:05] brother simmers you want to have
[53:07] preeminence over me you want to tell me
[53:10] how to run my life but you're only
[53:12] telling them what the word of god said
[53:14] for their own benefit amen you're trying
[53:17] to help them amen because you see down
[53:19] the road amen all your rebellion and all
[53:22] your rejection we know what is waiting
[53:24] on you down the road it's going to make
[53:26] your life more difficult it's going to
[53:28] make your walk even more harder to walk
[53:32] that the walk amen that straight narrow
[53:35] way we know all about that we know amen
[53:38] that you're going to have struggles we
[53:40] know that you're going to need to be
[53:42] stronger we know that when you come down
[53:45] to your tests when things are amen amen
[53:48] when your battle really gets hard and
[53:50] aiming to roll really get rough and
[53:52] tough it means that you're going to need
[53:54] that deeper walk with god you're going
[53:57] to need that place where you know amen
[53:59] that you know that you know that god is
[54:03] my god and i know i trust you lord
[54:06] you're going to need him when you walk
[54:08] through the valleys and shadows of death
[54:10] amen you're gonna have to have something
[54:12] that amen you're gonna have to have
[54:14] something down deep that said i will
[54:16] fear no evil because i know that you're
[54:18] with me lord i know
[54:22] no god
[54:25] i know you're with me
[54:28] praise god
[54:30] it won't be no more
[54:32] just intellectual knowledge just
[54:34] amen you can't take your meanness in
[54:36] there
[54:38] praise god you can't take your temple
[54:40] over there
[54:42] praise god you can't take your nasty
[54:44] attitude there
[54:46] praise god it's going to be perfect love
[54:48] and nothing else
[54:50] praise god it's going to be perfection
[54:52] amen it's going to be godliness amen not
[54:55] your type of godliness but it's going to
[54:57] be jesus christ
[55:00] are you with me
[55:01] it's going to be jesus living his life
[55:04] through you
[55:05] what a wonderful thing that jesus could
[55:07] come in tabernacle in human flesh and
[55:10] give us of his spirit and live in our
[55:12] lives what a wonderful thing that god
[55:15] has done for you and i that are willing
[55:17] to surrender and willing to subject
[55:20] ourselves and willing to lay down our
[55:22] amen praise god lay down our lives and
[55:25] lay down our thoughts and our ideals and
[55:28] take up our cross and follow him
[55:31] what is it amen
[55:33] brothers and sisters means everything
[55:37] praise god
[55:39] you know i was just meditating on the
[55:41] lord and i says you know we spend too
[55:43] much time on all the other stuff
[55:46] and you you i don't care how big a
[55:48] christian you think you are but you got
[55:50] too much baggage
[55:52] brother called me the other day
[55:55] from new york and i hadn't heard from
[55:57] him
[55:57] oh
[55:59] almost 20 years and he was telling me he
[56:02] said
[56:03] brother simmons
[56:05] you know i'm not where i need to be
[56:07] he said but
[56:09] i guess he's seen this on the internet
[56:10] or something and he says
[56:13] and i appreciate the brother and he
[56:15] started telling me he says i hadn't seen
[56:18] you almost 20 years
[56:20] he said but you know
[56:22] i got to be honest with you
[56:24] she said
[56:25] i believe the lord is soon to come
[56:29] he said i know
[56:30] in my spirit
[56:32] i know i ain't where i need to be and i
[56:34] know i'm not serving the law he said i
[56:36] got too many weights
[56:38] and i know i i'm weighted down and i got
[56:41] to get rid of these weights that i have
[56:44] and i'm honest with you i got weights
[56:46] and i got situations that i got to get
[56:48] out of
[56:49] if i'm gonna make it
[56:50] but he said i know
[56:52] for sure that the lord is soon to come
[56:55] he said i can look around and i can see
[56:57] the signs of the time and
[56:59] [Music]
[57:00] man he could not preach me
[57:03] on the phone
[57:04] but knowing that he ain't ready
[57:08] so i told him where the church was in
[57:10] the bronx and so forth
[57:12] i i mean i gave him
[57:15] the pastor's number that he could go to
[57:17] church there if he wants to
[57:19] but by the grace of god now
[57:22] i'm gonna tell you something brother and
[57:23] sister
[57:24] uh you can you can know it
[57:28] you can know the lord is soon to come
[57:30] you can know things are right not right
[57:32] in your life but what you're gonna do
[57:34] about it
[57:35] or you're gonna still take the weights

[59:04] oh he was man
[59:06] if we ever needed to pray he said those

[1:03:46] last
[1:03:47] all that other stuff that you achieve
[1:03:49] and accomplish ain't gonna mean nothing
[1:03:51] over there where we going and none of
[1:03:53] that's gonna mean a thing
[1:03:56] praise god
[1:03:57] and all folks say about you do tell you
[1:04:00] that all of that's gonna be over with
[1:04:02] after a while anyway
[1:04:04] so you ain't got to worry about it
[1:04:05] because that you you ain't taking it
[1:04:07] over there so you might as well just
[1:04:09] leave it on
[1:04:11] amen you might want to say well i
[1:04:13] everything amen because that's yo that's
[1:04:16] your joy and your crown you overcame how
[1:04:18] did you overcome in love you overcame

[1:04:25] you overcame that's your victory
[1:04:29] if you don't have to go through nothing
[1:04:30] how are you going to have any victory
[1:04:33] how are you going to be an overcomer
[1:04:36] amen the things that you suffer amen
[1:04:38] when you get over there you say thank
[1:04:40] you lord for allowing me to hold to your
[1:04:43] unchanging hand in spite of all the
[1:04:46] difficulties and all the snails and all
[1:04:48] the traps and all the talking about all
[1:04:51] i've been to
[1:04:52] thank you lord
[1:04:54] thank you lord
[1:04:56] god you did it for me
[1:04:58] god you did it for me
[1:05:01] spite of all you did it for me
[1:05:03] oh yes brother and sister it'll be worth
[1:05:06] it all when you amen when you cross over
[1:05:09] there
[1:05:10] it'll be all over
[1:05:13] amen we got something to praise the lord
[1:05:15] about
[1:05:16] we got something to be thankful to god
[1:05:18] about
[1:05:21] so we're talking about
[1:05:22] the seal of god and the mark of the
[1:05:24] beast
[1:05:25] are you with me
[1:05:27] so in on jeremiah 32 we're talking about
[1:05:30] we said it was three things we're
[1:05:32] talking about the seal represent to
[1:05:34] finish war uh that it's a finish work uh
[1:05:38] transaction or finish work we're talking
[1:05:41] about it represents ownership
[1:05:44] and we talk about the seal represents
[1:05:46] security
[1:05:48] so it's three things if you're taking
[1:05:49] notes okay finish work
[1:05:52] or finish transition the transition
[1:05:55] transaction
[1:05:58] ownership
[1:05:59] and security
[1:06:01] okay
[1:06:02] so by the grace of god the seal of god
[1:06:04] now
[1:06:05] you got to uh examine your walk with
[1:06:07] christ and see whether or not you uh
[1:06:10] believe in yourself that you're sealed
[1:06:12] now i i told you all the time on my
[1:06:15] christian walk i i knew i wouldn't see
[1:06:17] him
[1:06:19] i knew i hadn't you know i i hadn't come
[1:06:22] to the place my face you haven't come
[1:06:24] into the place where you you know you
[1:06:27] you almost uh scared you might backslide
[1:06:31] i don't know what about some of y'all
[1:06:33] but i i was in that place as a young
[1:06:35] christian uh fearing that you know i
[1:06:38] god uh you know you're begging god every
[1:06:40] day hey lord help me you know you stand
[1:06:44] on your prayer on your knees day and
[1:06:45] night asking god to keep you because
[1:06:47] you're in a place now that you know
[1:06:49] you're bathed in christ and and you know
[1:06:52] you just you know so many things that
[1:06:54] you got to overcome and you got to know
[1:06:56] you're strong enough to keep on moving
[1:06:58] on
[1:06:59] but as a baby state i you know you have
[1:07:02] struggles you have things that you're
[1:07:03] facing in your life and you know you
[1:07:05] hadn't got that deeper walk yet you know
[1:07:08] you you had a man you hadn't got so far
[1:07:10] over
[1:07:12] praise god
[1:07:13] but some people didn't
[1:07:15] don't go through that struggle
[1:07:17] so i said lord help me the whole long
[1:07:20] you know and i i i kind of count the
[1:07:22] first year
[1:07:23] and i i kind of attracted my first year
[1:07:26] my my first year journey i said lord if
[1:07:29] you could keep me
[1:07:31] you know i i've been out there a little
[1:07:33] bit
[1:07:34] i've been out there thinking that i was
[1:07:36] somebody but i said lord if you can just
[1:07:38] keep me just one year
[1:07:41] you know i i believe that i'll be i i'll
[1:07:44] cross over somewhere
[1:07:46] and i and i i stayed in prayer
[1:07:49] amen oh i was confronted with things but
[1:07:52] i wanted to be kept
[1:07:54] or you would be
[1:07:55] so you battled in proud constantly in
[1:07:58] prayer doing everything you you and god
[1:08:01] kept me
[1:08:03] you know
[1:08:04] and i said how can i let a year
[1:08:06] being in christ pass me by amen how can
[1:08:11] i go back and start amen this stuff
[1:08:15] but you know god was sealing me away
[1:08:18] amen but it it it it took uh uh
[1:08:22] steps amen in my life and amen and god
[1:08:26] was proving himself faithful to me
[1:08:29] because i knew in this journey that i
[1:08:31] wasn't able to keep myself and i wasn't
[1:08:33] able to i wasn't strong enough to to be
[1:08:36] able to endure i knew that i i knew i
[1:08:40] needed him to do it for me because i
[1:08:42] told him i said lord i knew you were
[1:08:44] able to keep that which i've committed
[1:08:46] unto you against that day and lord i've
[1:08:49] committed my life to you and i'm asking
[1:08:51] you lord constantly keep that which i've
[1:08:54] committed unto you
[1:08:56] he said you don't have to beg the lord
[1:08:58] to do that he's gonna do that i said but
[1:09:00] you know when you you're a young baby
[1:09:02] and young christian amen you you don't
[1:09:05] know how to approach him you're just
[1:09:07] telling him you know constantly lord
[1:09:09] amen you come down to your tests you the
[1:09:11] lord you are able to keep that which
[1:09:14] i've committed unto you
[1:09:16] and sometimes people say amen oh boy you
[1:09:19] stronger than me
[1:09:21] oh you so strong i said no
[1:09:23] i asked god to keep that which i've
[1:09:25] committed in him it's the god is the
[1:09:28] strong one i'm the weak one and i
[1:09:30] realize that and i always keep that in
[1:09:33] my mind that i know i can't keep myself
[1:09:37] if i'm gonna be kept it's gonna be him
[1:09:39] that keep me
[1:09:41] praise god
[1:09:45] so uh

[1:09:53] uh

[1:09:56] that he might be buried in this
[1:09:58] particular field and i'm going to tell
[1:10:00] you something there's something about
[1:10:03] them
[1:10:04] having a barrier place because joseph
[1:10:06] when he got ready to leave
[1:10:08] uh when the children were illegal was to
[1:10:10] leave
[1:10:11] egypt
[1:10:12] joseph was told he said
[1:10:15] you know
[1:10:16] i don't want you to bury me in egypt
[1:10:20] are you with me
[1:10:22] he was careful to tell them when you
[1:10:25] leave egypt
[1:10:27] take my bones with you
[1:10:30] praise god i want you to bury me
[1:10:33] amen with my
[1:10:36] father with my mother bury me
[1:10:39] he had a certain birthing place where he
[1:10:42] wanted to see god just don't want you to
[1:10:44] be buried anywhere
[1:10:47] amen see some folk will bury you just uh
[1:10:50] in egypt or in anywhere
[1:10:53] is it how you want to be baptized
[1:10:56] we'll baptize you any way you want them
[1:10:59] amen but he said
[1:11:01] when you leave here
[1:11:03] bury me
[1:11:05] take my bones with you
[1:11:07] praise god i'm gonna tell you brother
[1:11:09] sister amen he wanted to be buried
[1:11:12] in the place where the resurrection was
[1:11:14] going to take place
[1:11:16] amen are you what man
[1:11:18] because he knew one day job said though
[1:11:20] the skin worms eating my flesh yet in my
[1:11:23] flesh shelves i'll see god and joe said
[1:11:25] i know at the latter day i stand upon
[1:11:28] the earth

[1:11:58] them with the good canes
[1:12:00] are you up man
[1:12:02] i'm going to tell you something that's
[1:12:03] why it makes a difference while you're
[1:12:05] buried
[1:12:06] praise god because when you're buried
[1:12:09] amen you've got to be buried in the
[1:12:10] place where the resurrection going to
[1:12:12] take place

[1:12:51] name of jesus christ
[1:12:54] i'm going to tell you brother and sister
[1:12:55] so when i said the finished work uh
[1:12:58] finished transition
[1:13:00] transaction okay uh 32 and and
[1:13:04] 11. he said jeremiah 32 and 11. so i

[1:13:15] according to the law of and custom
[1:13:18] and
[1:13:21] that which was over
[1:13:24] and i gave the evidence of the purchase
[1:13:29] unto
[1:13:30] barack
[1:13:32] baruch
[1:13:34] and
[1:13:35] the son of
[1:13:38] narayana

[1:13:45] okay
[1:13:47] in the sight of my hannah leo

[1:13:52] and in the presence of
[1:13:54] the witnesses
[1:13:56] and subscribe

[1:14:01] before all the jews that sat in the
[1:14:05] courts of the prison

[1:14:10] it was the evidence
[1:14:12] of the transaction

[1:14:19] he said both which was sealed
[1:14:22] i'm talking about when you seal
[1:14:25] amen it's a finished word the
[1:14:27] transaction has been finished
[1:14:29] are you with me

[1:14:51] of god which he's purchased with his own
[1:14:53] blood all right are you up man
[1:14:56] so when jesus died on the cross shedded
[1:14:59] his blood he said he gave up the ghost

[1:16:20] jeremiah 32 you'll find out
[1:16:23] the things that we're saying amen
[1:16:26] first of all
[1:16:27] it's it's talked about
[1:16:28] offending he finished your transaction
[1:16:31] transaction amen next of all it showed
[1:16:35] that ownership
[1:16:36] next of all it showed that you're
[1:16:39] secured
[1:16:40] amen
[1:16:41] i'm gonna talk about you know
[1:16:44] some people don't feel i say because you
[1:16:46] don't go deeper though you don't feel
[1:16:48] like yo your christian walk is secure
[1:16:53] and it's not not secure a lot of people
[1:16:55] don't have security
[1:16:57] you know they don't have eternal
[1:16:59] security a lot of people they don't feel
[1:17:01] secure and they're not secure what
[1:17:04] they'll want because they know they're
[1:17:05] not secure
[1:17:07] and how many how long will you not a
[1:17:10] walk in security know that you're secure
[1:17:13] know that you're
[1:17:14] safe for some people uh
[1:17:19] they they they walk and they walk
[1:17:21] trembling scared and fearful
[1:17:24] that anytime they can backside anytime
[1:17:26] they can go out and commit adultery or
[1:17:28] fornicate or do any kind of thing
[1:17:30] anytime they can do it
[1:17:33] because why they're not secure
[1:17:35] anytime they can pull up for pornography
[1:17:37] and start watching it again
[1:17:40] because they are not what
[1:17:42] they're not secure in their walk they
[1:17:44] hadn't gone deep enough
[1:17:46] and and so so it's so many people that
[1:17:49] are so insecure
[1:17:50] if it's ever been an hour where
[1:17:52] christians i i'm talking about uh
[1:17:55] whereby christians seem to be more
[1:17:57] secure ever ever many times i'm talking
[1:18:00] about grand mamas and granddaddies
[1:18:03] i'm talking about folks that have been
[1:18:05] supposed to serve in the lord uh uh
[1:18:07] whole
[1:18:09] i'm talking about if it's anybody ever
[1:18:11] ever been a time when folks
[1:18:15] are insecure amen
[1:18:17] i'm going to tell you something
[1:18:19] in your house you don't feel secure
[1:18:22] on your job you don't feel everything is
[1:18:25] uh
[1:18:26] your job and you just think amen i'm on
[1:18:28] the job 25 years amen i got a retirement
[1:18:33] i can set back and knowing that this job
[1:18:36] i got job security
[1:18:38] amen but in the church people used to
[1:18:41] come and they get filled with the holy
[1:18:43] ghost and they feel secure people come
[1:18:46] and they say i'm filled with the holy
[1:18:48] ghost and they ain't secure because they
[1:18:50] say it
[1:18:52] praise god it's something that's got an
[1:18:54] ankle in your soul
[1:18:57] praise god what's it once the holy ghost
[1:19:00] come and see you it you can't seal
[1:19:02] yourself that's right
[1:19:04] amen you can't feel yourself with the
[1:19:07] holy ghost you can say i'm filled but
[1:19:09] you can't feel yourself that's right
[1:19:12] the holy ghost is the evidence that the
[1:19:14] blood has been applied
[1:19:16] praise god uh you know you might claim
[1:19:19] the blood you can claim it all you want
[1:19:21] amen until the blood claims you
[1:19:25] are you with me
[1:19:27] the blood claims you and let you know

[1:19:33] well
[1:19:34] i'm pleased to dwell

[1:19:39] so it's a different thing
[1:19:41] when the blood has secured you and
[1:19:44] you're not walking in your own security
[1:19:47] because your security will fail you
[1:19:51] praise god if you're trusting in
[1:19:53] yourself you gonna fail

[1:28:09] people
[1:28:10] the ones that's out there leading the
[1:28:12] way elvis and all kind of names you know

[1:28:19] lot of people that wouldn't abroad is
[1:28:21] the way to lead it to what
[1:28:23] destruction isn't that right
[1:28:25] straight in
[1:28:26] but you know what
[1:28:28] when it all boils down we're going to
[1:28:30] wish we made the right decision
[1:28:35] you know i i said in the prisons
[1:28:37] all over the state of south carolina
[1:28:39] especially young men i i sat there with
[1:28:42] them the young ladies i sat there with
[1:28:44] them
[1:28:45] and as i look at them in the comm the
[1:28:47] things that they've done something i'm
[1:28:49] facing 20 30 years and they're sitting
[1:28:52] there
[1:28:53] telling me their stories you know
[1:28:55] and i sat there and look at them what
[1:28:57] what can i do
[1:28:59] some says
[1:29:00] well i never came forget the young man
[1:29:02] he said i was in med school and i want
[1:29:04] to get back out i want to go back to med
[1:29:06] school i want to be a doctor he said but
[1:29:09] i made the wrong choice
[1:29:12] he said you know anybody can help me
[1:29:14] because i you know i made a bad decision
[1:29:17] one time
[1:29:18] i said well bro
[1:29:21] you know i got a cousin that's so and so
[1:29:23] on and i will see
[1:29:26] but
[1:29:27] to see the pain
[1:29:29] of making the wrong choice
[1:29:32] it don't take but a moment to make the
[1:29:34] wrong choice
[1:29:35] but it don't take about a moment to make
[1:29:37] the right one too
[1:29:39] are you real man
[1:29:40] you can make the right decision in a
[1:29:43] moment and you can make the wrong one in
[1:29:45] just a moment
[1:29:47] and your whole life is destroyed by
[1:29:49] making the wrong choice and your whole
[1:29:52] life can be saved by making the right
[1:29:54] choice
[1:29:56] are you with me
[1:29:57] so that's up to you i'm glad that god
[1:29:59] came by
[1:30:01] and brought conviction to my heart
[1:30:03] as a young man because my pathway
[1:30:07] you know i can look at most of my
[1:30:09] friends and most of the fellows to play
[1:30:11] ball with me
[1:30:12] most of them was dead before they got
[1:30:15] out of their 20s
[1:30:16] or they were serving life sentences
[1:30:20] and some of them was bound to
[1:30:22] professional ball
[1:30:23] but they got caught up in the drug scene
[1:30:27] and i look around and i see him and i
[1:30:29] said i said lord you spared me
[1:30:33] you spared me you came to me
[1:30:36] as a young person and you gave me that
[1:30:38] opportunity to make that decision to
[1:30:41] make that choice
[1:30:42] and i'm glad that god
[1:30:44] touched my heart and i made the right
[1:30:46] decision
[1:30:49] i don't i don't regret it i missed out
[1:30:51] on my youth they say
[1:30:53] i missed out on all the pledges of this
[1:30:56] life they say
[1:30:58] because all i know is
[1:31:01] the lord jesus
[1:31:04] he he hasn't failed me yet
[1:31:08] he's good to me
[1:31:10] and i thank god
[1:31:12] how many of you thank god for the
[1:31:13] decision you made to serve christ
[1:31:23] i said i was going to get there but it
[1:31:25] seemed like that's another whole story
[1:31:27] if i don't do nothing to read then
[1:31:30] greeting ought to be enough
[1:31:32] 13 and 14 revelation
[1:31:35] and it is saving them to dwell on the
[1:31:37] earth by the means of the miracles which
[1:31:40] he had power to do in the sight of the
[1:31:42] what
[1:31:44] beast
[1:31:46] sand to them that dwell on the earth
[1:31:49] that they should make an image to the
[1:31:51] beast
[1:31:52] which
[1:31:53] had
[1:31:55] the wounded by a sword and did live
[1:31:59] and he had power to give life into the
[1:32:02] image of the beast
[1:32:04] and that image that the image of the
[1:32:07] beast should both speak
[1:32:09] and calls
[1:32:13] and calls that
[1:32:15] as many as
[1:32:16] would not worship the image of the beast
[1:32:20] should be what
[1:32:22] i'm gonna tell you the supreme court
[1:32:25] is making some drastic decisions
[1:32:30] right now
[1:32:34] and you can see what
[1:32:37] who the supreme court justices are
[1:32:43] and i'm saying you can find out who the
[1:32:45] senators and representatives are
[1:32:47] and who the president is
[1:32:50] remember if it was possible to see the
[1:32:52] very lay
[1:32:55] it's going to come down to a religious
[1:32:56] small
[1:32:59] it won't be a computer
[1:33:02] it won't be a shot an injection
[1:33:06] but it won't be
[1:33:10] russia
[1:33:12] it won't be communism
[1:33:15] because it never that'll never deceive
[1:33:17] the very land
[1:33:20] it's got to be close to you
[1:33:22] like it was jesus judas was to jesus
[1:33:30] he said friend
[1:33:32] treasure me with a
[1:33:34] kiss could it be so close to you
[1:33:39] the one that went out and cast out
[1:33:40] devils and came back and you know what
[1:33:43] are the twelve
[1:33:48] could that one be right here among you
[1:33:51] that would cause you
[1:33:56] if you would not receive the mark but
[1:33:58] you need to know what it is
[1:34:02] you see the mark of god the seal of god
[1:34:05] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:34:07] if that's
[1:34:09] spiritual
[1:34:11] wouldn't the mark of the beast be
[1:34:12] likewise
[1:34:16] are you with me
[1:34:17] so brother and sister we are right at
[1:34:19] that
[1:34:20] point
[1:34:22] that people are
[1:34:24] don't know what's going on but it's
[1:34:26] working
[1:34:28] underground
[1:34:29] by the time it come out it's too late
[1:34:35] by the time it hit the earth
[1:34:38] you see the whole world was paralyzed by
[1:34:40] coronavirus
[1:34:43] what if the antichrist come and take
[1:34:45] over boom overnight
[1:34:48] if coronavirus could do that what if the
[1:34:50] anti-christ come boom take over
[1:34:54] people said well i thought the rapture
[1:34:55] takes place full of tribulation
[1:34:59] rather than says it did
[1:35:01] but did you miss it
[1:35:04] why because you failed to get that
[1:35:05] deeper walk
[1:35:08] you just wanted to be do enough just to
[1:35:10] say i'm in the church and and i'm saved
[1:35:12] that's all you wanted you didn't want to
[1:35:14] go see how you all ran now
[1:35:17] are you with me see how your lamps went
[1:35:20] out
[1:35:21] are you with me
[1:35:23] because you didn't do the extra
[1:35:26] you didn't think it's necessary to do
[1:35:28] the extra
[1:35:30] that deeper walk that you were satisfied
[1:35:32] with just going to church and just you
[1:35:35] know i i'm religious i'm saved and i
[1:35:38] ain't worrying about nothing
[1:35:40] you know we got that nonchalant attitude
[1:35:45] but
[1:35:45] it's it's a folks that's serious about
[1:35:48] god
[1:35:49] and serious about their walk
[1:35:52] serious about their soul
[1:35:54] put a mark upon them
[1:35:57] all the rest of them
[1:35:59] don't worry about it
[1:36:00] praise god
[1:36:02] because
[1:36:04] the one with the writers ink horn
[1:36:07] the one with the
[1:36:09] destroyed weapon coming through
[1:36:13] amen
[1:36:14] and he looking for those that got the
[1:36:16] mark if they don't have the mark he says
[1:36:17] slam
[1:36:22] children

[1:36:27] so
[1:36:28] it's common brothers and sisters right
[1:36:29] around the corner
[1:36:31] maybe later than you think

[1:36:38] we're doing and and
[1:36:40] just do our little thing and we can do
[1:36:43] it and we think we're getting by just do

[1:36:55] take god's light put things
[1:36:58] before god
[1:37:00] how they re
