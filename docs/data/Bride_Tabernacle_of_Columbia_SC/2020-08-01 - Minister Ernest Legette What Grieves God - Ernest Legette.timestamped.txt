[19:50] what to do
[19:52] but oh god i know that from the
[19:54] beginning of time you saw all these
[19:56] things before they even happened
[19:58] and god i know that you've already got
[20:01] the way prepared for us
[20:04] so i pray right now lord by the holy

[20:22] oh jesus have mercy i pray bless us now
[20:27] thank you for all your many blessings in
[20:30] jesus christ's name
[20:32] amen
[20:35] amen we want to look at the book of
[20:36] hebrews by god's grace
[20:39] hebrews 3.
[20:52] it was something i've been ministering
[21:00] on
[21:04] hebrews 3 and we'll begin at the
[21:09] at the 7 first
[21:13] hebrews 3 and 7 and it reads
[21:18] wherefore as the holy ghost saith today
[21:21] if you will hear his voice
[21:23] harden out your hearts as in the
[21:26] provocation
[21:27] in a day of temptation in the wilderness
[21:29] when your fathers tempted me
[21:32] prove me and saw my works 40 years
[21:35] wherefore was i grieve with that
[21:38] generation
[21:39] and said they do air always err in their
[21:42] way
[21:42] in their heart and they have not known
[21:45] my ways
[21:46] so i swear in my wrath that
[21:50] i mean they shall not enter into my rest
[21:53] take heed
[21:54] brethren lest there be in any of you
[21:57] an evil heart of unbelief in departing
[22:01] from the living god but exhort one
[22:04] another daily
[22:05] while it is called today lest
[22:08] any of you harden through deceitfulness
[22:11] of sin
[22:13] for we are made partakers of christ if
[22:16] we hold
[22:17] the beginning of the con confidence
[22:19] steadfast
[22:20] of our confidence steadfast until the
[22:22] end while it is said
[22:24] today if you will hear his voice harden
[22:27] out your heart
[22:28] as in the provocation for some when they
[22:31] had heard did provoke
[22:33] howbeit not all that came out of egypt
[22:35] by moses
[22:37] but with whom he was grieved 40 years
[22:40] was it not with them that had sinned
[22:43] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[22:46] and to whom
[22:48] swear he that they should not enter into
[22:50] his rest
[22:51] but to them that believe not so we see
[22:55] then
[22:55] so we see that they could not enter in
[23:00] because of unbelief may god have blessed
[23:02] to the reading of his word
[23:04] tonight by god's grace just for a moment
[23:08] i want to speak to you on a topic and i
[23:12] entitled it what grieves god amen
[23:15] what grieves god or will say what makes
[23:19] god angry you know we're just looking
[23:22] here and we when we're looking at that
[23:24] word
[23:25] grieve we says that you know what hurts
[23:29] god
[23:30] or what wounds him what brings him pain
[23:34] you know what saddens him or what or
[23:37] what upsets him
[23:39] you know or in one particular way they
[23:43] say
[23:43] what breaks his heart come on i says
[23:47] what grieves god what saddens him what
[23:50] what makes him angry what what breaks
[23:53] his heart
[23:54] so we're talking about tonight
[23:57] what grieves god so we know here i says
[24:00] here in the scriptures is just a little
[24:02] something that
[24:02] you know the lord had put on our hearts
[24:04] and i've been ministering on it now for
[24:06] the last couple weeks but
[24:07] it's just is is what grieves god what
[24:10] you know we always say that faith is the
[24:13] key
[24:14] come on that that unlocks every door
[24:18] all god wants is you know somebody to
[24:21] believe
[24:21] him all that he does all that he does in
[24:25] the prelude of the
[24:27] the the miracles the signs and the
[24:29] wonders you know what he says that 80
[24:30] i think they said 80 of jesus ministry
[24:33] was healing
[24:34] so what he was doing he was just trying
[24:37] to
[24:38] to do something in the people's midst
[24:40] just to just to get their faith to arise
[24:43] just so they can believe him that's what
[24:46] god
[24:46] god wants god wants you know someone to
[24:50] believe
[24:50] him you know i says that here in the
[24:53] scriptures
[24:54] how how it wraps up you know just
[24:56] talking about the children of israel
[24:59] it says that you see it says we see that
[25:02] many of them they couldn't enter in
[25:04] because of their unbelief
[25:06] so we know that you know when we're
[25:08] talking about sin
[25:10] you say what is sin sin isn't isn't
[25:13] necessarily drinking
[25:14] smoking committing adultery and all
[25:16] those things those are the attributes of
[25:18] sin
[25:19] but what sin is the real sin is the
[25:22] unbelief
[25:23] you do those things because you don't
[25:26] believe
[25:27] uh god is who he say he is or you do
[25:30] those things because you don't believe
[25:32] that
[25:32] they that do those things what god said
[25:35] is going to happen to do
[25:36] they do those things that's why they can
[25:38] live those lives
[25:39] that's why you know people can uh play
[25:42] church that's why people can make all
[25:44] kind of jokes about
[25:46] god and and have no respect for him
[25:49] it's not that you know that that is just
[25:52] a sin
[25:52] but they don't believe that he is god
[25:56] and he's gonna he's gonna repay one day
[25:58] so they do those things but
[26:00] god you know he goes to extra distance
[26:03] a lot of times just to get us he does we
[26:06] would call him extraordinary but
[26:08] he does supernatural things just to get
[26:10] us to believe
[26:12] and that's what we wrestle with a lot of
[26:14] times i like how
[26:15] in the scriptures he says he says uh
[26:19] will he find faith you know when he
[26:21] returns
[26:22] because he talks about uh the unjust
[26:24] judge
[26:25] and he talks about how you know the
[26:28] unjust judge
[26:29] he didn't fear god nor man but it was a
[26:32] woman who needed something
[26:33] done he she needed some avenging so she
[26:36] kept coming to him and he says that
[26:39] let let me so this lady won't won't wear
[26:41] me he said let me just go ahead and
[26:44] and uh give her a request cause because
[26:46] her
[26:47] i believe her faithfulness her diligence
[26:49] before she wearing me
[26:50] but he it goes on to say in the
[26:52] scriptures that men ought to pray always
[26:55] without fainting he says so if the
[26:57] unjust judge
[26:58] would do those things he says how much
[27:01] more than
[27:02] that you know our god or or what he do
[27:05] for the elect
[27:06] you know it's not i i want to encourage
[27:09] everybody
[27:10] that it's not don't get weary and well
[27:12] doing you know the bible says that
[27:14] you know they that wait upon the lord
[27:17] they'll renew their strength
[27:18] you know they'll mount up wings as
[27:20] eagles come on you waiting
[27:22] you're waiting on the lord you might get
[27:24] tired you might get a little weary
[27:26] sometimes
[27:27] in this journey because you're pressing
[27:28] your way you you got patience and you
[27:30] wear it
[27:31] but it says they that wait on the lord
[27:33] they'll renew their strength come on
[27:35] in that time when you feel as though you
[27:38] weary and you might faint
[27:40] watch what god does he'll come down
[27:43] sometimes when you think you ain't got
[27:44] enough to go that extra mile
[27:46] god just you just send something fresh a
[27:49] fresh anointing a fresh
[27:51] something on your life and what it does
[27:53] it gives you
[27:55] faith to say hey i feel like traveling
[27:57] on i feel like going a little bit
[27:59] further last night
[28:00] it was a battle it was a fight i might
[28:02] have felt like giving up but i got a
[28:04] little bit more fight in me
[28:05] i got a little bit more patience i got a
[28:07] little bit more i'mma wait just a little
[28:09] bit longer
[28:10] lord on the lord what it was it wasn't
[28:12] you
[28:13] but it was god did something in the
[28:15] spirit that gave you
[28:17] a little bit more to go on and i thank
[28:19] god for that and sometimes
[28:21] we need that sometimes we need to get
[28:23] down on our knees and pray
[28:25] and say god i need a little bit more
[28:27] lord come on i remember when uh
[28:29] when the church uh world in the book of
[28:31] acts when they were
[28:32] getting pressure and persecuted on on
[28:35] every end
[28:36] i believe that the bible says they got
[28:38] together and they began to pray
[28:40] even though they know persecution was
[28:42] hidden and they were hiding sometimes
[28:44] going but they said lord give us
[28:45] boldness god
[28:47] god we need something from you god to
[28:49] help us
[28:50] because we know that it's the mountains
[28:52] that we're gonna have to climb we know
[28:53] it's an uphill fight
[28:55] but god give us boldness lord to stand
[28:57] so they had to pray to god
[28:59] for for a little extra and that's what
[29:02] it is i says
[29:03] as an individual from the ministry on
[29:05] down we can't be
[29:07] we can't be um ashamed to say god i need
[29:10] more lord i need i need more god
[29:13] lord what i got oh i believe david said
[29:16] uh my cup runneth over he didn't just be
[29:19] satisfied with just a little bit of
[29:21] feeling of the cup god let my cup run
[29:24] over god let it spill
[29:25] i need more and that's the way i've been
[29:27] praying here lately i said god i need
[29:30] more lord i need your help god i need
[29:32] you to increase my boundaries god i need
[29:34] your blessings
[29:35] god i need spiritual wisdom lord i need
[29:38] guidance i've been trying it on my own
[29:40] god and you know trying it on my own it
[29:43] just don't work out
[29:44] all the time i said god i need you your
[29:46] step your help
[29:47] every step of the way you know this
[29:50] world is so wicked
[29:51] we come into times where it's so evil
[29:53] come on that the bible says that
[29:55] if it were possible it'll deceive the
[29:57] very elect you know it says that
[29:59] you know he was going to deceive all in
[30:01] the end the the
[30:02] the rich the the poor the bond the free
[30:06] all these people says god if it is that
[30:08] way how much more
[30:10] do we need to not just or just walk with
[30:12] god but we need to be like god we need
[30:15] god to
[30:16] to be in us engulf us god what i that's
[30:19] what we say is
[30:20] it's always the importance of receiving
[30:22] the baptism of the holy ghost and that's
[30:24] what we want to talk about tonight
[30:25] not it's not good enough just to come
[30:28] out but you got to go in come on
[30:30] and he says they didn't go in because of
[30:32] unbelief and that's what we're battling
[30:34] with tonight they were going into a
[30:36] natural land
[30:37] but you and i god has brought us out of
[30:39] sin and shame brought us
[30:40] out of out of the uh of denominational
[30:43] creeds and dogmas the way we can see
[30:46] that it's not it's not man made theology
[30:49] and all these things but we've been
[30:50] brought
[30:51] to the word we see god for who he is and
[30:53] now he's saying i want you to do what
[30:55] don't don't be like them don't perish
[30:57] but i've done so many great things for
[30:59] you believe me
[31:00] don't have an evil heart of unbelief but
[31:02] i want you to go in
[31:04] come on he said they died you know a lot
[31:06] of times we see
[31:07] casualties no no i'm getting ahead of
[31:10] myself
[31:10] but we see casualties god did so many
[31:13] great works
[31:14] so many great things in people's lives
[31:16] brought them delivered them from alcohol
[31:18] delivered them from prostitution crack
[31:20] cocaine delivered them from many things
[31:22] maybe heal their bodies
[31:24] brought them off of a death bed so many
[31:27] uh
[31:27] powerful testimonies but yet god has
[31:29] done those things but don't stop there
[31:31] because
[31:32] god you can have a powerful testimony
[31:34] and still not gideon come on
[31:36] still die in the wilderness you think
[31:38] about those that were walking around in
[31:40] the wilderness
[31:40] those 40 years they could talk and they
[31:43] could tell some of the younger group
[31:45] of that was with them oh how we were in
[31:47] bondage and god sent the man
[31:49] one day with thus saith the lord god
[31:51] began to do
[31:52] it took what we call supernatural
[31:54] intervention he would come down and he
[31:56] done some mighty things
[31:57] i was there when the red sea open i was
[31:59] there when they gave us water in the
[32:01] desert i was there come on
[32:03] when all these great battles and all
[32:04] these come on many of them were there
[32:06] but what happened they didn't get in
[32:08] they died in the wilderness come on but
[32:10] you had two
[32:11] that that they didn't have what they
[32:14] call a sin of unbelief they didn't
[32:16] wouldn't uh um they said we know god has
[32:18] brought us from a mighty long way
[32:20] and yes god has won some battles for us
[32:22] but we ain't gonna stop right here come
[32:24] on we still got a race to run
[32:26] we still got ground we got to obtain the
[32:29] battle ain't over yet we still
[32:30] got to go in come on let's go in and
[32:33] that's what he says
[32:34] i always i says what it is you know god
[32:37] i don't want
[32:38] uh uh uh your your testimony uh your
[32:42] or or the be in vain come on and that's
[32:45] what the devil want to do
[32:46] he want to destroy your testimony he
[32:49] wants you to perish with all those great
[32:50] things god has done for you
[32:52] come on your testimony to be in vain i
[32:55] said don't let your testimony be in vain
[32:57] but be victorious come on being over
[33:00] like he says
[33:01] they they have overcome come on i know
[33:03] he said you overcome the world because
[33:05] i've overcome the world don't just
[33:07] uh you know you can have a lot of good
[33:09] victories but did you win the war
[33:11] come on when it was said and done did
[33:13] you come out with when you come out
[33:15] standing strong
[33:16] did you come out victorious you might
[33:19] have won the battle here and won the
[33:20] battle there but when the whole picture
[33:22] was done come on
[33:23] hey did you come out victorious was the
[33:26] end of the story you won
[33:28] and that's what it is we fight battles
[33:30] and we might lose some battles
[33:31] but at the end of the day i want to win
[33:33] the war how many want to win the war
[33:35] tonight
[33:35] and that's what we're finding that says
[33:37] you know you know he says that that many
[33:40] you know we find that they didn't enter
[33:42] in uh because of their unbelief
[33:44] and you know i says that you know from
[33:47] those things
[33:48] smoking drinking all those things they
[33:50] aren't
[33:51] they aren't uh that isn't what what
[33:53] we're seeing is that's just the
[33:54] attributes of it
[33:56] you do those things you know because you
[33:58] just don't believe
[34:00] who he is and i says what it is you're
[34:02] not separated
[34:05] from god because of those things you do
[34:08] but you're separated from god because
[34:12] you you you chose not to walk in his
[34:14] provided way
[34:15] come on god made a way of escape for you
[34:19] but you chose not to walk in that way so
[34:22] you inherited all those attributes of
[34:24] sin that's why you do those things
[34:27] because you don't believe come on many
[34:29] people say i believe
[34:30] well you know you do those things
[34:32] because you don't believe if you
[34:34] genuinely believed you know a god
[34:38] and what he said then you wouldn't you
[34:39] wouldn't do those in your heart you
[34:41] might slip but you'll quickly be
[34:42] reconciled with god
[34:43] because you you believe god and you what
[34:45] you want to do in your heart he says
[34:48] they had
[34:49] in them it says in them was an evil
[34:51] heart
[34:52] come on of unbelief and that's what it
[34:54] is god
[34:55] that's the part that god is judging god
[34:58] is judging our heart now god knows
[35:00] that we're just men and and and we like
[35:02] to say that
[35:03] and sometimes we get caught up in the
[35:05] situations and all that but what's ever
[35:07] in your heart
[35:08] come on that's what's going to come out
[35:10] we look at a tree
[35:12] you know i've heard it saying that the
[35:14] fruits on the tree
[35:16] ain't what ain't what makes the tree
[35:18] good or bad
[35:19] it only identifies uh uh what the tree
[35:22] is come on
[35:23] the fruits of the apples or whatever it
[35:25] just identifies what type of tree it is
[35:28] the oranges just identifies what type of
[35:30] tree it is
[35:31] and that's why it says uh uh you'll
[35:33] you'll know
[35:34] uh uh you'll know the tree come on by
[35:37] the fruit that it bears
[35:38] so a lot of times you can speak from
[35:40] your heart
[35:41] but we ain't just i mean you can speak
[35:43] from your mouth
[35:44] but we ain't looking at a lot of times
[35:46] will come out of your mouth
[35:48] because what comes out of the man's
[35:50] mouth sometimes might deceive him
[35:52] but you let the word try it come on the
[35:54] word is
[35:55] sharper than any two-edged sword it can
[35:57] divide those things
[35:59] it can look beyond the scenes or what
[36:01] the preacher can't look beyond
[36:03] it can look beyond the scenes of what
[36:05] the world can't see and it
[36:07] when it looks beyond the scene it sees
[36:09] the real you
[36:10] and that's what uh god wants to deal
[36:12] with that's what all the
[36:13] the crying out the preaching is about to
[36:17] to to shake you up because it wants to
[36:19] deal with the real you come on
[36:21] the outward a man might deceive a person
[36:25] day by day but what's in that heart come
[36:27] on that's what we want to deal with
[36:29] i said god i might not have it all right
[36:31] many times on the outside
[36:33] but when you look in my heart god let my
[36:35] heart be right
[36:36] let my heart be in a way i believe in
[36:40] david and all all of his wickedness that
[36:43] you can look at and the things he done
[36:46] god can say he's a man after my own
[36:48] heart come on
[36:49] i know that in his heart come on he's
[36:51] it's something in his heart
[36:53] i ca i can look over that when y'all
[36:54] want to stone him and kill him
[36:56] and dethrone him i can say i forgive him
[36:58] be oh i can say i'm gonna bear with him
[37:00] because i know what's in his heart
[37:02] come on and that's what it is i say god
[37:05] that's when you look in my heart god
[37:07] in my heart let me you know i like that
[37:09] song and say that's in my heart
[37:11] to serve the lord lord let it be in my
[37:13] heart god
[37:14] i'm not so much necessarily looking at
[37:16] the outside because if the heart is
[37:18] right
[37:19] the outside gonna get right come on
[37:21] because that's what it says
[37:23] when you look at when you look at the
[37:24] fruit of the tree it's going to identify
[37:27] what type of tree it is and i thank god
[37:30] for that
[37:30] so that's what we we we contend with i
[37:33] said is that you know
[37:35] the the your unbelief that's what it
[37:37] does
[37:39] you're not separated from god because
[37:40] you're a sinner but
[37:42] and that's what happens when you choose
[37:44] not to walk in this provided way come on
[37:46] you destroy yourself a lot of times you
[37:49] know i was thinking
[37:50] about noah in the days of noah you know
[37:52] yes they were
[37:53] evil and and the thoughts and
[37:55] imagination of men's heart was on evil
[37:57] continually
[37:58] come on i believe we're living in such a
[38:00] day as that now
[38:01] all the way you look around men's heart
[38:03] on evil continually
[38:04] but yet they're religious and they still
[38:07] want to confess god
[38:08] they want to have a form of godliness
[38:10] come on but they're still denying the
[38:12] power
[38:13] i believe that god still has power and
[38:16] his power
[38:17] he can still keep you come on i don't
[38:19] care how wicked the world is and how
[38:21] many
[38:21] pools that the world got on you but once
[38:23] the holy ghost
[38:24] has come in and to you it's an anchor
[38:27] come on that's what it is
[38:28] it's an anchor that when the world began
[38:31] to pour on you
[38:32] the winds begin to try to toss you that
[38:34] anchor gonna hold you come on
[38:36] it's gonna keep you solid why because
[38:38] there's power in that anchor that anchor
[38:40] ain't just
[38:40] hooked in the sand but that anchor is
[38:42] hooked on a rock hallelujah
[38:44] come on when you want to get loose i
[38:47] thank the lord
[38:48] that he still got you anchored and he
[38:51] reminds you come on
[38:52] it's only for a little while endure i
[38:54] want you to fight
[38:55] he didn't like he says he i give you the
[38:57] land but you're going to have to fight
[38:59] for it every
[39:00] place that you touch i'm giving it to
[39:02] you hallelujah
[39:04] i look at it like way i said lord what
[39:06] it is this mind
[39:07] let's don't talk negative we speaking
[39:09] positive it's mine why
[39:11] because the lord gave me a promise this
[39:13] is where my foot stepped on and god has
[39:15] given it to me
[39:16] now i'm gonna fight for it but god is
[39:18] fighting all of my battles
[39:20] but i believe that well we find that
[39:22] like it says
[39:24] what it is uh to encourage your faith we
[39:26] look at like i was saying i was
[39:28] meditating on
[39:29] on the days of noah how the imagination
[39:32] of men's heart
[39:33] come on it was on evil continually but
[39:36] that ain't what that ain't what
[39:37] destroyed them what destroyed them was
[39:40] when god made a way of escape for them
[39:42] come on god had to provide a way of
[39:44] escape then
[39:45] the ark come on and even though they
[39:48] were sin and wicked
[39:49] i believe if they would have got in the
[39:50] ark they would have been saved come on
[39:52] but they chose not to get in the ark
[39:54] they chose to die
[39:56] in their sins and that's what jesus says
[39:59] once he says that
[40:00] if you don't believe that i'm he come on
[40:02] he says you'll die in your sins come on
[40:04] you got to believe that i'm here and i'm
[40:06] and i'm telling you something that's
[40:08] going to help you save your soul
[40:09] i'm telling you something that's gonna
[40:11] keep you out of the out of the
[40:12] tribulation that's gonna keep you
[40:14] from separating yourself from god it
[40:16] might hurt your flesh
[40:18] you might not want to do it but what i'm
[40:19] telling you it's gonna save you
[40:21] come on and that's what it is you know
[40:23] the word that's why it says preach it in
[40:25] season out of season oh it hurts
[40:27] sometimes
[40:28] we have to battle sometimes but it's for
[40:30] the saving of your soul
[40:31] god won't do nothing to hurt you but he
[40:33] does those things because he loves you
[40:36] and he don't want you to perish with the
[40:38] world he's made a way of escape
[40:39] that's what he came and all is coming
[40:42] and dying for you imagine
[40:43] to the extent god went to save us he
[40:46] didn't send nobody but he came himself
[40:49] he bled and he died he he let him whip
[40:51] him he let him spit on him
[40:53] and and went that distance why because
[40:55] he loved you and i
[40:56] and for him to make a way of escape and
[40:59] yet people every day
[41:00] they choose that they don't want to walk
[41:02] in that way of escape but they rather
[41:03] die in their sins
[41:05] come on but god has a chosen group that
[41:08] that that love and they and they and
[41:10] they thank god they're thankful for what
[41:13] he done for him god
[41:14] if you can go that distance from me lord
[41:15] i can go the distance from you
[41:17] come on the world is picking at you for
[41:19] wanting to be holy the world is
[41:20] picking at you for wanting to stand up
[41:22] and be honest and live right for god the
[41:24] world is picking at you because you
[41:26] ain't indulging in sin
[41:27] but what is that i said lord let the
[41:29] world mock but god i want to be one of
[41:31] those despised few
[41:33] they rejected you god what about and i
[41:35] know that they reject me as well
[41:37] but god i'm willing to bear that
[41:38] reproach why because of my love for you
[41:41] god
[41:42] you could have left me in my sin you
[41:44] could have had me
[41:45] uh dying without a without a a a a a
[41:48] a way oh god to be reconciled back to
[41:51] you but
[41:52] even when i was dead and trespassing sin
[41:55] god you buried with me
[41:56] god thank you and that's what we thank
[41:59] the lord for come on
[42:00] so we find that and that's what should
[42:02] have been enough
[42:04] you know even with the children of
[42:06] israel that we find in here
[42:08] that should have been enough when they
[42:11] god when we look
[42:12] back lord and see where you brought us
[42:14] from and we see god what you've done for
[42:16] us
[42:17] oh god then we're going to stay with you
[42:19] lord come on we could have stayed in
[42:21] egypt and just died there
[42:23] but god if i die here in the battlefield
[42:25] lord let me die but i know i won't die
[42:27] come home why because you promised that
[42:29] you'll give me the land come on
[42:30] so what it is we we just saying that
[42:33] going through the motion but god
[42:34] when we look back if israel can only and
[42:37] that's what uh
[42:38] joshua and caleb you know the bible says
[42:40] you know after the ten spies come back
[42:42] and
[42:42] they had the people all shook up come on
[42:45] in their minds
[42:46] it's giants in the land the bible says
[42:48] that joshua and caleb
[42:49] steal the people come on and they said
[42:51] come on yeah
[42:52] it might be giants in the land it says
[42:55] but our god is
[42:56] able come on he's able can't you see i
[42:59] believe they wanted to remind the people
[43:00] come on
[43:01] what god has done for you look back
[43:03] ain't that enough
[43:04] shouldn't that have sealed your
[43:06] testimony god done those things because
[43:09] out of all that you asked god for he did
[43:11] things time
[43:12] at the time again just to get you to
[43:14] believe him and now here we are
[43:16] we're to the place to where we at the
[43:18] land it's time to go in
[43:20] you're going to let the devil stop you
[43:21] from going in come on you're going to
[43:23] let the devil
[43:24] get you to stop believing god now after
[43:26] all that god has done for you come on
[43:28] brother and sister let's stop like me
[43:31] and let's quit
[43:32] looking at the situation in the battle
[43:34] before us and let's just press on
[43:36] knowing that if god
[43:37] didn't want god to do it again he never
[43:40] failed his promises are yeah and nothing
[43:42] god never gave us a promise that he
[43:44] didn't come through on and if
[43:46] whatever it takes god i'ma wait on him
[43:48] come on
[43:49] stand there that's what he says you know
[43:52] i says what grieves god come on
[43:55] what hurts them what makes them angry
[43:57] the bible says that
[43:59] for 40 years what he says was i grieve
[44:02] with that generation
[44:04] because why they didn't believe me
[44:06] that's all that i've done for them they
[44:08] they it didn't that god didn't give them
[44:10] the land they chose not to go in
[44:12] and that's what it is many people they
[44:14] say that
[44:15] you know when when you come in and you
[44:18] repent of your sins
[44:19] and you've been baptized come on in the
[44:22] name of the lord jesus christ
[44:23] and for the mission of your sins the
[44:25] bible says
[44:26] come on it's not that what the man told
[44:29] you or what the preacher told you but
[44:30] the bible says
[44:32] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[44:34] ghost come on
[44:35] you ain't got to work for it it's a gift
[44:37] that god has given you
[44:38] if you don't go in come on it's because
[44:41] you chose not to go in
[44:42] you believe even for the saving uh or
[44:45] the salvation
[44:46] for your salvation to be sanctified come
[44:49] on go on in
[44:50] to the promise what it is god has
[44:52] promised you the holy ghost
[44:53] i said the holy ghost is yours all you
[44:55] got to do is receive it don't let the
[44:57] devil you scarecrows you to the land
[44:59] it's giants and all those things come on
[45:01] it was a
[45:02] supernatural happening that brought you
[45:04] out of sin and it's going to be a
[45:05] supernatural happening to bring you into
[45:07] the land
[45:07] into the promise of the holy ghost god
[45:09] i'm looking for the supernatural
[45:11] god i'm looking for you to do something
[45:13] real again in my life that's what it is
[45:15] we pressing on to it
[45:16] devil i might be here today i'll fall
[45:19] down today and
[45:19] fall down tomorrow but i'm still
[45:21] pressing i'm still getting up
[45:23] i'm still fighting the holy ghost is
[45:24] mine why because god promised it to me
[45:27] and i ain't gonna perish god has brought
[45:29] too much for me for me to die in the
[45:31] wilderness god
[45:32] has brought me too far to come and just
[45:33] be a former church member i can't do
[45:36] that come on
[45:36] you say i got to go on then i got to be
[45:39] that super racist
[45:40] i got to be that one that lay hands on
[45:42] the sick and they shall recover not
[45:44] because of me
[45:45] but it's the power that god has invested
[45:47] in you by the holy ghost come on
[45:49] you got to be the one do the greater
[45:51] works
[45:53] come on an evil heart
[45:56] he said of unbelief makes god angry
[46:00] because time and time again people don't
[46:01] believe them
[46:03] all that i've done for them and yet they
[46:05] don't believe me
[46:06] the bible said he swore by his wrath
[46:08] come on he was angry
[46:10] he said i swore about my wrath they
[46:12] ain't gonna enter in come on
[46:14] i did all what what else can i do you
[46:16] know the bible says that
[46:18] uh or without faith it's impossible
[46:22] to please god come on it's impossible
[46:25] to please him without faith he says
[46:27] before you
[46:28] even come to god you got to first
[46:31] uh believe that he is god come on
[46:35] and that he's a rewarder of them that
[46:38] diligently seek him come on
[46:41] he put that in there because sometimes
[46:43] like we were
[46:44] saying and he says man ought to pray
[46:46] always come on
[46:47] you know pray day and night come on god
[46:50] god ain't
[46:51] some people think their prayers going on
[46:53] there so come on but god ain't forgot
[46:55] your prayers god
[46:56] he heard you i like how he told i think
[46:58] it was daniel
[46:59] or one he said i heard you the first day
[47:01] that you prayed come on
[47:02] he said ever since the first time you
[47:04] prayed i heard you but what it was the
[47:06] devil
[47:06] you know we know he was trying to hinder
[47:08] the blessed god he says but i heard you
[47:11] the first day you prayed come on and
[47:13] that's encouraging
[47:14] to me we keep praying and we keep crying
[47:17] but god he heard you the first time come
[47:19] on and what it is
[47:21] we didn't stop we kept pressing we kept
[47:24] pressing
[47:25] not only did we press but we confess
[47:28] come on that the work is already done
[47:30] you know the bible says that these
[47:32] things
[47:32] were done before the foundation of the
[47:34] world come on only thing we doing is
[47:36] just
[47:37] acting out and moving in the path that
[47:39] god has allotted for us
[47:41] and i thank god for that come on i says
[47:43] god just help me to be faithful
[47:45] i know they they sing a song sometimes
[47:49] i promise the lord come on that i hold
[47:51] out come on
[47:52] hold out until he comes come on come on
[47:55] is that just a song are we holding out
[47:57] is that just a song or are we waiting
[48:00] are we willing
[48:01] to have patience come on i believe the
[48:03] bible says
[48:04] let patience have it have his perfect
[48:06] work come on
[48:07] that it might perfect us and that's what
[48:09] we're doing what are we doing right now
[48:11] waiting on the lord come on what are we
[48:13] doing right now waiting on this
[48:14] leadership
[48:15] waiting on his direction or where we
[48:17] going to go come on
[48:18] god has all the answers how many believe
[48:20] that but we says
[48:22] what grieves god i say is that you know
[48:25] let's look at hebrews 4
[48:27] by god's grace what grieves god you know
[48:31] what what makes
[48:32] them like we said what makes them angry
[48:37] come on i said god i don't want to make
[48:39] you angry
[48:41] god i don't want to upset you lord i
[48:44] don't want to
[48:45] like they say break your heart come on i
[48:48] don't want to break your heart lord
[48:49] come on but god i just want to believe
[48:51] you
[48:52] and and whatever you path you got set
[48:56] before you
[48:56] before me lord help me to believe you
[48:59] whatever situation
[49:01] you know might come my way lord help me
[49:04] just to stand
[49:05] firm hold out come on
[49:08] until you come i like how in the
[49:11] scriptures
[49:12] even jesus looked at the disciples and
[49:15] at that time i think it was 70 walking
[49:17] with him and
[49:18] he said set the man eat my flesh and
[49:20] drink my blood come on
[49:22] and then he won't have an apartment he
[49:24] was saying no says man that's a hard
[49:25] saying
[49:26] they walked away and they went back and
[49:28] then jesus look at the rest and say hey
[49:30] are you going to walk away as well one
[49:33] point he called one of them the devil
[49:35] says i chose 12 of you but one of you a
[49:37] devil come on he said you're going to
[49:39] walk away
[49:39] but peter i believe it says lord
[49:43] he says uh we know that what you're
[49:46] saying i don't even understand it i like
[49:48] i said i don't even understand what
[49:49] you're saying i'm not gonna say oh i
[49:52] know what you're saying he said lord i
[49:53] don't even understand what you're saying
[49:54] right now
[49:55] he said but i know god that in in the
[49:58] buy-and-buy
[49:59] you'll reveal what you're saying he says
[50:02] plus he says where we gonna go
[50:04] come on we don't for sukkah where we
[50:07] gonna go
[50:08] i'm convinced that that you got the the
[50:11] keys come on
[50:13] we're just paraphrasing it to your
[50:14] eternal life you got what i'm
[50:16] what i need you got something that i'm
[50:18] longing for so
[50:20] i don't understand it right now but i'm
[50:22] willing to wait on it i'm willing to
[50:23] follow you to the end god
[50:25] come on and that's what it is a lot of
[50:27] times
[50:28] you know uh things happen that cause you
[50:31] to turn around
[50:32] but i believe as peter said we don't
[50:34] forsook all lord where we gonna go
[50:36] come on you know the man that happened
[50:38] forsook and all he's got planned to turn
[50:40] around at any time
[50:43] he's got something in reserve held back
[50:45] so when the battle gets hot
[50:47] he's got a backup plan come on but
[50:50] with guards you don't need a backup plan
[50:53] with the lord
[50:54] he is the backup plan as we say come on
[50:56] i believe
[50:57] when he asks you to come when he calls
[50:59] the man he says
[51:00] drop what you're doing you don't need to
[51:02] come on just follow me i already got the
[51:04] way made
[51:04] and what it is he's asking you to step
[51:06] out on faith
[51:08] he didn't even show abraham but he said
[51:10] get you out of your country come on from
[51:12] around your family come on get you out
[51:14] there you say well you know how many
[51:15] bandits and thieves out there you know
[51:17] how many nations out there
[51:18] that might consume us no he said get you
[51:20] out of there and then abraham i don't
[51:22] believe
[51:22] was concerned about those things but by
[51:25] faith
[51:26] he stepped out come on not knowing where
[51:28] he was going but
[51:29] it says that he he professed that he was
[51:32] a pilgrimage he was in search for
[51:34] something
[51:34] for a city whose builder and maker was
[51:37] god come on he wasn't concerned about
[51:39] the other nations around him that could
[51:40] have potentially swallowed him up
[51:42] but by faith he stepped out he made that
[51:45] he made that movement by faith to step
[51:49] out and just believe god come on without
[51:52] a backup plan like he says
[51:54] he says he told jesus told peter knows
[51:56] he said no man
[51:57] has forsaken all come on you might think
[52:00] you gave up something but god
[52:01] jesus gave up way more than what we gave
[52:04] up he said but since you did give it up
[52:05] i'm gonna give you not only a
[52:07] hundredfold in this life but in the life
[52:09] to come i'm gonna give you everlasting
[52:10] life come on
[52:11] i encourage you tonight give up
[52:13] everything forsake all
[52:15] you don't need like we said they say a
[52:16] backup plan god is your backup plan
[52:18] recycle
[52:20] reserve you know because god is he he's
[52:22] going to make the way god
[52:24] is already there we're stepping out what
[52:25] it is we're stepping out
[52:27] we're moving out in faith i believe that
[52:29] how many want to move out in faith today
[52:31] come on
[52:32] which says we're not not to be in a
[52:34] radical way
[52:35] but as paul says once he says in the way
[52:39] that
[52:39] i worship god they call it heresy in the
[52:41] way that i worship god
[52:43] he says all these things i believe paul
[52:45] had a lot of things
[52:46] at his disposal but he says that when i
[52:48] i counted it all what
[52:50] loss so i might gain christ come on
[52:54] he had a revelation that you had to
[52:56] forsake all
[52:57] he had a revelation come on the the
[53:00] give it all up i believe the bible says
[53:03] that that that uh
[53:04] uh moses he forsook uh uh
[53:07] to be the son of pharaoh's daughter he
[53:10] forsook the throne come on all these
[53:12] things
[53:12] to be what to go out there and be
[53:14] amongst god's children to be
[53:16] because he saw uh something greater in
[53:19] him
[53:19] he saw something greater in the
[53:21] afflictions and the suffering
[53:23] he saw he had a vision that the other
[53:25] ones couldn't see
[53:26] and that's what it is god has to change
[53:29] our vision
[53:30] that way we ain't looking on these
[53:31] natural eyes but we're looking through
[53:33] the eyes of faith
[53:34] we're looking into the spirit realm we
[53:36] can see what the other
[53:38] church members can't see we can see what
[53:40] the other people ain't seeing that's why
[53:42] we can go to this and you can try to
[53:43] convince them but if they ain't seeing
[53:45] what you see and they won't be able to
[53:46] go the only thing you can do is pray
[53:48] and say god open their eyes that they
[53:50] can see lord come on
[53:52] there is blessings in the suffering it's
[53:54] blessings if i hold out
[53:55] it's blessings if i live oh god
[53:57] according to what you asked me to do god
[54:00] come on hallelujah and i believe that
[54:02] with all of my heart
[54:04] oh glory to god come on what grieves god
[54:08] let's look here at hebrews 4 by god's
[54:11] grace
[54:12] 4-1 it says
[54:16] let us therefore fear lest a promise
[54:19] being left us
[54:20] to enter into his rest less less a
[54:23] promise being left us of entering to his
[54:25] rest
[54:26] any of you should seem to come short of
[54:29] it come on
[54:30] you know like we was talking about that
[54:32] he's talking about that natural rest
[54:34] but today what we're looking at we're
[54:36] looking at
[54:37] entering to the true rest come on
[54:39] entering into the
[54:40] the baptism of the holy ghost a place
[54:42] the way you resting
[54:44] from your your sinful works your labels
[54:46] a place to where
[54:47] like we says the battle is over because
[54:50] why greater is he that is in you
[54:52] than he that is in the world he said let
[54:54] us fear
[54:55] come on unless lest any of you would
[54:58] come
[54:59] short of that promise come on he says
[55:01] and not enter in
[55:03] you know paul laying it out here he says
[55:06] fear what it is
[55:07] he says i want he said let us fear he
[55:09] says don't don't fall
[55:11] short of it come on don't get to the
[55:13] place and fall
[55:14] short you know i believe that he says in
[55:17] one place
[55:17] he says you did run well you ran well
[55:20] but what hindered you come on
[55:21] you ran you ran the race but when you
[55:24] got to the finish line you didn't cross
[55:25] over
[55:26] come on he says don't fall short of it
[55:29] but run you know those runners when they
[55:32] see that
[55:33] they might be running and jogging but
[55:34] when they see the finish line in their
[55:36] view
[55:37] you know they might be tired they might
[55:39] be on their last leg
[55:40] but it's something when they see the
[55:41] finish line they give it all they got
[55:44] they give it to the body drop why the
[55:46] run that's the hardest
[55:48] they're gonna run when they see the
[55:49] finish line they might have been running
[55:50] but they're gonna run even harder
[55:51] when they can see the end why because
[55:53] the end is near so we got to run harder
[55:56] and i want to say you might have been
[55:57] running but i want to i want to
[55:58] encourage you today you we see the end
[56:00] is now how you know the end is now
[56:02] because we see the
[56:04] pestilence and the things coming on the
[56:06] earth we see that
[56:07] that the prophecy is being fulfilled we
[56:09] see that that everything is coming
[56:11] to a head now we see that god has given
[56:13] us no other way of escape but him come
[56:16] on
[56:16] the the medical world ain't gonna say
[56:18] that they failed you
[56:19] because they doing their best but god is
[56:21] allowing things to come up in from every
[56:24] in the job world economy busted come on
[56:26] there's no other way out
[56:29] but look up come on there's no other way
[56:32] out
[56:32] but get down on your knees and say lord
[56:36] here it is lord we're at the finish line
[56:39] we got to run now
[56:40] if i prayed uh if i ever prayed i really
[56:43] got to pray now
[56:44] but i ever pressed i really got to press
[56:46] now hallelujah
[56:48] because i see the finish line right
[56:50] there and i'm gonna run with all i got
[56:52] god oh hallelujah when i get to the end
[56:55] even when i don't have enough watch god
[56:57] come down
[56:58] watch those angle wings come down and
[57:00] bear you up and pick you up and carry
[57:03] you on across the finish line
[57:04] i believe that with all of my heart god
[57:06] ain't gonna let you just fall and die he
[57:08] gonna say i saw
[57:09] you pressed i saw you gave it all you
[57:11] got hallelujah
[57:13] and i'm gonna take you the rest of the
[57:15] way and i believe that
[57:17] oh i believe that with all of my heart
[57:19] so what it is
[57:20] he says he says let
[57:24] he says let us therefore fear
[57:27] lest a promise being left us of enter
[57:29] into his rest any of you should come
[57:31] short don't come short of it
[57:32] come on i said go in that's what i'm
[57:36] saying
[57:36] you know we're looking at god giving us
[57:39] a warning
[57:40] he says i want to i believe paul writing
[57:42] uh god was giving us a warning
[57:44] come on don't be like them i want to
[57:46] show you how to they mistakes
[57:48] where they fell short don't you fall
[57:51] short
[57:52] he says he didn't even consider a lot of
[57:54] the other things he says but what where
[57:56] they fell
[57:56] short at was because of their unbelief
[57:59] where they got me upset with them
[58:01] well i swore by my wrath because all i'd
[58:03] done for them and they wouldn't believe
[58:05] me
[58:05] they refused to go in come on and i'm
[58:07] warning you
[58:08] don't you be like them but you go in
[58:11] come on when you get to the land don't
[58:12] you
[58:13] don't you start uh doubting and having
[58:15] faith but you keep pressing come on
[58:16] you keep fighting come on fight your way
[58:18] into the kingdom press your way into the
[58:20] kingdom the bible says
[58:22] he says that when john i believe talking
[58:24] about the kingdom of god
[58:25] he says that he said that every man come
[58:28] on
[58:28] you got the pressure into it come on he
[58:30] said the violent they gonna take it by
[58:32] force come on
[58:33] press your win to it fight your way into
[58:36] it don't come short
[58:37] take it by force it's mine healing is
[58:39] mine deliverance is mine
[58:41] the holy ghost is mine god promised it
[58:43] to me i'm
[58:44] taking it by force i'm not asking the
[58:46] devil for it
[58:47] to leave me and back up come on taking
[58:49] it because god gave it to me
[58:52] hallelujah and that's what it is taking
[58:55] it
[58:56] and like how here it says in the second
[58:58] verse
[58:59] he says for unto us was the gospel
[59:02] preached
[59:03] as well unto them but the word preached
[59:07] did not profit them not being mixed
[59:10] with faith of them in them that heard
[59:14] come on he said the word was preached to
[59:16] them
[59:17] come on for their day he says but it
[59:20] didn't profit them
[59:22] come on he said the word it didn't
[59:24] profit him
[59:25] the reason why i didn't profit them he
[59:27] said because
[59:28] they didn't mix it with faith come on
[59:31] they had
[59:32] they had the word and but they didn't
[59:34] they didn't have faith they didn't mix
[59:36] it with faith come on
[59:37] all of the word when you get in the word
[59:40] you know i like how the song says
[59:42] every time i hear god's word something
[59:45] in my heart
[59:46] gets stirred and i can feel the praises
[59:49] of rumbling in my soul come on that's
[59:51] what the word has got to do to if the
[59:53] word ain't stirring your heart come on
[59:55] the words got to stir your heart when it
[59:58] stirs your heart
[59:59] it's a faith what it is arising because
[1:00:01] something in you
[1:00:02] believing in what it said you believe
[1:00:05] that the word is true
[1:00:06] you believe that god is gonna come
[1:00:08] through you believe that god
[1:00:09] is gonna do what he says that's why it
[1:00:11] gives you joy unspeakable and full of
[1:00:14] glory why because you hearing the word
[1:00:16] something your heart gets sturdy you
[1:00:18] begin rejoicing oh thank you lord
[1:00:20] thank you god in the midst of what i'm
[1:00:22] going through i heard the word
[1:00:24] i believed it weeping may endure for a
[1:00:26] night but
[1:00:27] joy is coming in the morning something
[1:00:28] in my heart is dirt you say why are you
[1:00:30] praising god
[1:00:31] shouldn't you be looking at the things
[1:00:33] around you no i'm looking up
[1:00:34] i'm looking to the hills i see jesus i
[1:00:37] don't see my troubles i don't see my
[1:00:39] situation i see the promises of god i
[1:00:41] see god being who he said he was and who
[1:00:43] he
[1:00:44] promised he'll be more now than ever
[1:00:47] hallelujah i believe the word
[1:00:51] mix it he said it didn't profit them i
[1:00:54] asked the question
[1:00:55] is the word profit in you come on
[1:00:59] or is it not are you getting
[1:01:02] or you say the profit come on are you
[1:01:05] getting the full benefits out of the
[1:01:06] word come on
[1:01:07] are you seeing the dividends like let's
[1:01:10] say
[1:01:10] come out of the word are you seeing is
[1:01:12] the word profiting you
[1:01:14] or is it just with casual we just hell
[1:01:16] we yeah went to church had another good
[1:01:18] service what
[1:01:19] oh come on but it's the word profit in
[1:01:20] you are you coming out strong
[1:01:24] are you coming out better because that's
[1:01:26] what it is you know
[1:01:27] like we were saying those trials and
[1:01:28] tribulations what are they doing
[1:01:30] they building you come on to be better
[1:01:33] to be
[1:01:34] to be stronger i always like that how
[1:01:38] how uh and i use it all the time the
[1:01:40] example of david
[1:01:41] on the on but out there heard in the
[1:01:43] sheep come on what it was his trials and
[1:01:45] the things that he was faced with
[1:01:46] it was building them it was shaping and
[1:01:49] molding them making them
[1:01:50] until he and to who he was that he come
[1:01:53] to a place
[1:01:54] that you know no weapon come on formed
[1:01:56] against me is going to prosper
[1:01:57] he can write beautiful scriptures
[1:01:59] because he know he says
[1:02:01] he says the lord is my shepherd and i
[1:02:03] shall not want come on
[1:02:05] god has provided all my needs come on i
[1:02:07] don't know who your shepherd but i don't

[1:09:21] the battle
[1:09:23] we know we're at the end now
[1:09:27] somebody said how long would it take for
[1:09:31] the mark of the beast
[1:09:34] to take over
[1:09:38] how long would it take
[1:09:42] that our money that we have
[1:09:46] to be nothing and we're going to a
[1:09:49] cashless
[1:09:50] society that no man can buy
[1:09:54] not sell some folks say they can do it
[1:10:00] overnight
[1:10:04] because all the money
[1:10:07] the trillions the millions that they're
[1:10:09] giving out now
[1:10:14] they got nothing to back it up no gold
[1:10:16] standard no nothing
[1:10:21] so we're in a terrible condition now
[1:10:27] it used to be that they can look back
[1:10:31] and they can give you paper money or
[1:10:33] whatever
[1:10:35] but they had gold to back it up
[1:10:39] now they have nothing running out of
[1:10:44] resources
[1:10:48] how long would it take
[1:10:53] the world is saying
[1:10:56] i won't receive the mark of the beast
[1:11:02] but we'll find out that
[1:11:05] these conditions that we are facing
[1:11:07] right now
[1:11:10] the whole world has come to a standstill
[1:11:14] because of a virus
[1:11:18] the virus have taken the world and
[1:11:22] brought the whole world
[1:11:25] the bible said the man of sin will come
[1:11:31] the whole world is going to bow down and
[1:11:33] worship me
[1:11:38] the world needs help they need that
[1:11:42] superman to appear
[1:11:46] when he steps out on the scene with the
[1:11:48] answers
[1:11:51] to the problems that the world is facing
[1:11:56] the world are gladly
[1:12:00] received the antichrist
[1:12:05] won't be long brother sister
[1:12:10] the world would find their superman
[1:12:15] because they ex rejected jesus christ
[1:12:19] the word because of rejection of jesus
[1:12:24] christ's
[1:12:24] word
[1:12:28] as they rejected him when he was
[1:12:30] manifested in flesh
[1:12:33] now he's revealed in his own word
[1:12:37] and he's been rejected again
[1:12:41] they say that jesus was not the messiah
[1:12:45] he wasn't the king
[1:12:48] they said the word the bible the word of
[1:12:51] god
[1:12:52] i don't want it i don't want the word
[1:12:57] brother and sister look what kind of
[1:12:59] world we're living in
[1:13:01] they're not rejected and
[1:13:07] deny the word they won't have
[1:13:12] jesus the word
[1:13:17] there's no beauty to be desired to him
[1:13:20] because they have already
[1:13:24] they have their barabbas
[1:13:27] they have their creeds their dogmas
[1:13:29] their
[1:13:31] conceptions of what kind of god they
[1:13:33] want
[1:13:36] the god of lust the god of immorality
[1:13:42] they have their barabbas
[1:13:45] yes they have their god they have the
[1:13:48] one that they have sold out the word
[1:13:51] and said we don't want the word give us
[1:13:53] forevers
[1:13:56] they justify
[1:14:00] abortion and
[1:14:04] they justify all the immoralities
[1:14:08] that the world speaks against
[1:14:13] and they said that's the rivals we want
[1:14:17] not the bible not the word of god not
[1:14:20] jesus
[1:14:21] but we won't but rabbits
[1:14:26] we need jesus i said we need jesus
[1:14:31] we need the word we need god
[1:14:36] oh yes we need god the world need jesus

[1:15:05] don't grieve him no longer

[1:15:12] because it can take place overnight
[1:15:17] and no man can buy not sell

[1:15:23] beast
