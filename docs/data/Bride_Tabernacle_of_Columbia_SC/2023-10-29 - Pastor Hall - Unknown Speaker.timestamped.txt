[1:04:24] it's but just for a moment I want to I
[1:04:27] want you to take a journey with me and
[1:04:29] tell you about my life how I ended up
[1:04:32] where I'm at
[1:04:33] now I was born in Florida not too far
[1:04:37] from where we spoke of our brother there
[1:04:39] spoke of s choppy had a brother that's
[1:04:42] pastored in that area still today he's
[1:04:45] been pastoring about 55 years I'm the
[1:04:47] baby of 14 children the same mother and
[1:04:51] same father my grandparents were in in
[1:04:54] the late 1800s my father was born in
[1:04:58] 1917 we were not religious people my
[1:05:01] father and mother never talked about God
[1:05:04] they never mentioned God we didn't have
[1:05:06] a Bible in our home we were poor the
[1:05:08] home that I grew up in had holes in the
[1:05:11] walls they had no windows and some of
[1:05:14] you can relate to that old day they
[1:05:17] didn't have screens and sometimes in the
[1:05:19] night I heard some of my sisters
[1:05:20] screaming cuz a cow had got out the
[1:05:23] pastor and come and lick them on the
[1:05:24] face reaching into their bedroom we
[1:05:28] didn't we didn't have we didn't have of
[1:05:31] ourselves our own bed everything was
[1:05:34] shared by three or four children
[1:05:36] sleeping in one bed we didn't sleep long
[1:05:38] ways we slept sideways being the least
[1:05:42] of the
[1:05:42] 14 I never had the privilege of ever
[1:05:45] being able to sleep on the end but one
[1:05:47] time and I'll tell you about that in
[1:05:49] just a moment my older brothers my dad
[1:05:52] was an alcoholic he didn't serve God and
[1:05:55] he worked Faithfully he had to raise a
[1:05:57] lot of kids we worked a farm and my my
[1:06:01] father and mother didn't take us to
[1:06:03] church at that given time my father's
[1:06:05] the only guy I know that would leave
[1:06:07] home broke and come back with a fth of
[1:06:10] liquor and he's a type of guy that when
[1:06:12] alcohol got into his body brother he
[1:06:15] turned into a devil and he wanted to
[1:06:18] beat anything that was in front of him
[1:06:20] first of all was my mother and then Mom
[1:06:23] would get all of us kids up and take us
[1:06:25] to the woods and keep us out in the
[1:06:27] woods to 3 or 4:00 in the morning my
[1:06:30] father would pass out and then Mom would
[1:06:32] say it's safe to come back into the home
[1:06:35] and we'd go back in and get what sleep
[1:06:37] we could and then off to school we
[1:06:39] didn't have a school bus to pick us up
[1:06:41] at our house we had to walk three and
[1:06:43] four miles to meet the school bus life
[1:06:46] was easy to the extent of what it is
[1:06:49] today we we had to work I milk cows I
[1:06:52] milked 110 cows every morning morning
[1:06:54] for I went to school that's not with
[1:06:56] hands that's with an automatic milker
[1:06:58] cuz some ladies I told that to she said
[1:07:01] you do it by hand no I don't think I
[1:07:03] could make it to school if I had to milk
[1:07:05] 110
[1:07:06] cows when I got off the school bus I had
[1:07:09] to repeat the same process because so
[1:07:12] many kids it was a farm life one of my
[1:07:15] older brothers had turned to drugs and
[1:07:18] through that drug life he became pretty
[1:07:21] well wealthy at the time he had retes he
[1:07:24] had Trans Ams he had Condominiums he had
[1:07:27] Rolex watches and then during the
[1:07:29] summertime what break I could get I'd go
[1:07:32] stay with him and it was my brother
[1:07:34] there that one that had introduced me to
[1:07:37] drugs at a young age before long it
[1:07:40] wasn't just doing marijuana it wasn't
[1:07:42] just doing cocaine but now it's doing
[1:07:44] acid barbits Etc by the time I was 12
[1:07:48] years old my mind had been burnt the
[1:07:52] psychiatrist being four of four
[1:07:54] different psychiatrists had told my
[1:07:56] mother that I'd never retain that if you
[1:07:58] told me something I'd forget it five
[1:08:01] minutes later my life had diminished but
[1:08:04] I didn't know anything about religion I
[1:08:07] didn't know anything about God and
[1:08:10] that's the life that I took and it
[1:08:12] wasn't before long
[1:08:14] until one thing led to another my
[1:08:17] brother one afternoon asked me to ride
[1:08:19] with him to a house and in the paper
[1:08:22] sack was drugs I never seen them I just
[1:08:25] held them and he asked me to go to the
[1:08:27] door and pass the door through the drug
[1:08:29] uh the drugs through the door and they'd
[1:08:31] give me money and come back to the car
[1:08:33] well that will sound simple but it
[1:08:35] didn't happen that way that night that
[1:08:37] afternoon I was cut under the eye with
[1:08:40] my eyeball on my chin I went running for
[1:08:42] my life my brother left and I was shot
[1:08:44] in the back with a shotgun I'd made it
[1:08:47] to the swamp not too far outside of sop
[1:08:51] choppy and it crawled through the woods
[1:08:53] to make it through that about a city
[1:08:55] block there was a highway where a 72y
[1:08:57] old lady had picked me up that morning
[1:09:00] and took me to the hospital I knew there
[1:09:03] was something on my life but I didn't
[1:09:06] know what it was why God kept sparing me
[1:09:08] over and over it was after the getting
[1:09:11] out of the hospital my brother asked me
[1:09:13] to come back and stay with him I stayed
[1:09:15] three or 4 days it was during that time
[1:09:18] I had ODed on acid and tried to jump out
[1:09:21] of a car going 60 miles an hour when
[1:09:24] they had got me to the hospital they
[1:09:25] were working on my body I was trying to
[1:09:28] trying to uh pray in my thoughts I
[1:09:32] couldn't couldn't talk I couldn't
[1:09:34] breathe I couldn't get nothing out and I
[1:09:36] kept saying if there is a God I didn't
[1:09:38] know this God I didn't know nothing
[1:09:40] about this Jesus I said if there is one
[1:09:43] I need you to save me I need help I
[1:09:45] don't want to die like this God spared
[1:09:48] my life that day then before long about
[1:09:52] three weeks had passed this is this is
[1:09:53] the only time in my life that my
[1:09:55] brothers let me sleep on the end of the
[1:09:58] bed that night about 3:30 in the
[1:10:01] morning I felt something holding my hand
[1:10:05] there was a fire that illuminated up my
[1:10:07] whole arm right to the side of my head
[1:10:09] when I woke up there was nothing
[1:10:11] standing there but I could feel a
[1:10:12] presence I didn't know what it was I was
[1:10:15] scared I jumped up left the room and as
[1:10:18] most boys would do run to Mom that's the
[1:10:20] comfort and I told my mom I said there
[1:10:22] something in that room I don't want to
[1:10:24] go back in that room they said your
[1:10:25] brothers are in that room I said there's
[1:10:27] something in that room I don't want
[1:10:29] nothing to do with and my mother for the
[1:10:32] first time said
[1:10:33] Son do you know the Lord for the first
[1:10:37] time she mentions do you know the Lord
[1:10:40] and I said the Lord do you know that guy
[1:10:43] lives up there yeah that guy do you know
[1:10:45] him I said no Mom I don't know
[1:10:47] him so my mom prayed with me what little
[1:10:51] prayer she prayed what little background
[1:10:53] of Religion she had she was a good
[1:10:55] mother she was the best mother to me in
[1:10:57] the world my father not so much at that
[1:11:00] time and then it was after that
[1:11:04] morning about another three days would
[1:11:07] pass until I'd have a dream and then
[1:11:09] then this dream this whole time God's
[1:11:11] dealing with me but I don't know him but
[1:11:14] it's a process it's a step because what
[1:11:17] I want to talk about tonight is that
[1:11:19] you're God's promise and I'm going to
[1:11:21] prove to you by the Bible how you belong
[1:11:23] to God God and you know you you may not
[1:11:26] can get to God but he'll sure get to you
[1:11:29] RJ Reynolds he was a prime example he
[1:11:33] was the guy that founded the the Winston
[1:11:35] cigarette company he was an atheist at
[1:11:38] heart didn't believe in God didn't he
[1:11:41] and and his son had to be tutored inside
[1:11:43] of a prison being inside the house with
[1:11:46] a chain lead fence that's put around
[1:11:48] this entire premises of this Palace in
[1:11:51] which RJ Reynolds owned and but that
[1:11:54] young boy his own son was educated by
[1:11:57] tutors that was paid for and brought
[1:11:59] into the home and then one day RJ had to
[1:12:03] go up to Michigan to one of his
[1:12:05] conventions and he he he had lost his
[1:12:08] janitor who had taken care of the
[1:12:10] premises and the hedges and hired
[1:12:13] somebody else but little did he know

[1:12:17] that was Holy Ghost filled Hallelujah RJ
[1:12:21] had left town and that man got out there

[1:12:48] thought that boy needs to know about

[1:13:18] knowledge of religion or anything to do

[1:19:59] particular night when when I had had
[1:20:02] that dream of hell and I told God in
[1:20:05] that dream I said I don't know who you
[1:20:06] are but I don't want to go to hell it
[1:20:08] wasn't long after that that God gave me
[1:20:11] inspiration I gave my heart to him and

[1:20:17] mother and father said well we go as a
[1:20:19] family first time we're going to a
[1:20:21] Baptist Church
[1:20:23] amen and then from the Baptist Church we
[1:20:25] graduated we decid to step up a little
[1:20:28] bit move to the Methodist Church so we
[1:20:31] went on up to the Methodist Church and
[1:20:34] like most churches to me there was no
[1:20:36] life there you couldn't get an amen you
[1:20:39] couldn't get a smile out of the
[1:20:40] congregation you couldn't get a
[1:20:42] Hallelujah you couldn't get a wave

[1:20:47] spoke to me and I must confess please
[1:20:49] forgive me amen I'm a healthy man at my
[1:20:52] age but you sit on the back row and look
[1:20:54] up and see the chewing gum people have

[1:20:59] while put it back don't know who it
[1:21:00] belong to wouldn't do it today wouldn't
[1:21:03] recommend it and I'd grab that spearmint
[1:21:05] chew it a while put it back cuz I knew
[1:21:07] next week it'd be waiting on me amen
[1:21:10] that's the kind of life that I got out
[1:21:13] of going to church my sister dropped by
[1:21:16] she had done older sister she had done
[1:21:19] got married moved away and she found the
[1:21:21] Pentecostal Church
[1:21:23] and she says Mark I want to take you to
[1:21:26] a Pentecostal church I said what
[1:21:29] Pentecostal what is that said well
[1:21:31] you've been you went to the Baptist
[1:21:33] Church all right the Methodist Church
[1:21:34] but it's just a little bit more life
[1:21:36] than what I said I want to go amen if
[1:21:39] there's a church that's got some life
[1:21:41] that's where I want to go I went in that
[1:21:44] old church and there was a big old uh H
[1:21:46] wood stove over here top of it was
[1:21:48] cherry red that's how they heated the
[1:21:50] church bigger one right over over here
[1:21:53] and it was cherry red man if they would
[1:21:56] have warned me and told me how dangerous
[1:21:58] it was to go to a Pentecostal Church got
[1:22:01] look back then then white women wore
[1:22:03] their hair up
[1:22:05] here and it had about 400 bobby pins
[1:22:09] that was planted into it to hold it up
[1:22:11] called The Beehive and if you'd have
[1:22:14] told me how dangerous it was I'd have
[1:22:16] took goggles in a football helmet cuz
[1:22:18] when them women got to move in their
[1:22:20] heads and bobby pins were flying every
[1:22:22] everywhere you could get your eye poked

[1:22:28] take place in that church and them women
[1:22:30] and men get to running and to come
[1:22:32] around that corner they'd push off the

[1:26:50] offering he said you better go back in
[1:26:52] in there and ask for an
[1:26:54] offering I said I'm not going in there
[1:26:57] and ask for an
[1:26:59] offering I said look we made it here on
[1:27:04] $2.95 God got us here he's going to get
[1:27:07] us back 40 more
[1:27:09] miles so George was
[1:27:11] convinced we get halfway down the
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:18] road you thought we run out of gas but
[1:27:20] we didn't we had a flat
[1:27:23] I jump out of the car I'm on a spiritual
[1:27:27] High I am praising God I'm I'm lit yeah
[1:27:30] you know what I'm talking about when you
[1:27:31] have felt God like you're lit and I was
[1:27:34] excited I was looking up to the Stars I
[1:27:36] was thanking God and George is still
[1:27:39] sitting in the
[1:27:42] car I said George come on open the trunk
[1:27:47] he's still sitting in the car I knew
[1:27:49] something's wrong George
[1:27:52] we don't have a spare do
[1:27:56] we he said on top of that we ain't got a
[1:28:03] jack I said okay George I'm gonna take
[1:28:06] the Bible and I'm going to do exactly
[1:28:09] what it
[1:28:10] says God be my witness to the day I send
[1:28:13] before the Judgment this is exactly what
[1:28:15] I did I laid my hands on a sick Tire
[1:28:18] Bible said lay hands on sick didn't say
[1:28:20] sick people that's how I computed as a
[1:28:24] young preacher and I said God I need air
[1:28:27] in this tire I need to get home Lord I
[1:28:28] need you to put air in this tire and I
[1:28:30] prayed and I said God I believe you I
[1:28:32] believe you I went back behind the car
[1:28:34] George is sitting there with that old
[1:28:35] doubt and Thomas spirit and all of a
[1:28:37] sudden I could hear the noise he heard
[1:28:39] the noise he jumped out of the car cuz
[1:28:40] it's something was
[1:28:43] going when George jumped out they was
[1:28:46] air right back in that
[1:28:49] time that's my second Super natural that
[1:28:53] I seen God
[1:28:55] do I don't have time tonight to share my
[1:28:58] whole life but my journey started in
[1:29:01] 1978 in
[1:29:03] 1988 in that 10year period I was already
[1:29:07] on four television stations I had built
[1:29:10] a Pentecostal Ministry to 8 and 10,000
[1:29:14] people that's how I blossom in 10 years
[1:29:18] in 1988 I was pastoring a church a
[1:29:21] little over 200 people in morgon and God
[1:29:24] sent a little seed woman in that
[1:29:27] Pentecostal church that started giving
[1:29:29] me quotes of brother
[1:29:33] brandham and then it got to where she
[1:29:36] says to my wife who is here tonight
[1:29:39] Sister Hall we just celebrated our
[1:29:41] anniversary and by the way it's my first
[1:29:43] wife my last wife it's the only wife
[1:29:45] I've
[1:29:46] had don't have another one 38
[1:29:50] years
[1:29:52] that's my sugar booger and I ain't
[1:29:54] letting go of her I'm keeping her she's
[1:29:57] got me trained you don't want to stop
[1:29:59] when you get trained don't want to start
[1:30:03] over she said it's too far to drive back
[1:30:07] to my house every Sunday can I come to
[1:30:10] your
[1:30:12] house oh Lord that was a mistake for me
[1:30:15] but not for God I had no way of getting
[1:30:18] to God but God got to
[1:30:20] me she every Sunday brother Holloway she
[1:30:25] would bring quote after quote after
[1:30:27] quote and then she brought me a sermon
[1:30:31] called serpent seed I listened to that
[1:30:34] sermon on serpent seed seven times and
[1:30:37] the light went
[1:30:40] off I told her I said she said do you
[1:30:43] see what's happened in the message of
[1:30:45] the hour that this Pentecostal shout and
[1:30:48] all the emotion some of it's fake some
[1:30:50] of it's real I said I understand
[1:30:52] she said you got to make a decision I
[1:30:54] said oh no I'm not splitting my
[1:30:58] church I got so traumatized folks this
[1:31:02] is the
[1:31:03] truth I was under so much pressure
[1:31:07] because if I accepted this truth that's
[1:31:09] being presented to me the message of the
[1:31:11] hour I'm going to lose my church and all
[1:31:14] these conferences that I have built that
[1:31:16] I was preaching in in the television
[1:31:18] stations I had reached the Pinnacle of
[1:31:20] my Ministry
[1:31:22] and if I if I go this direction I'm
[1:31:24] going to lose every bit of it and I'm
[1:31:26] going to be right back to right back to
[1:31:28] the start I would not have no
[1:31:30] Fellowship this is how traumatized I
[1:31:33] became I took a 357 Magnum went out in
[1:31:36] the woods loaded the gun stuck it to my
[1:31:38] temple and pull the
[1:31:41] trigger I had to make a
[1:31:44] decision suicide was the way out for me
[1:31:48] but when I pulled the trigger nothing
[1:31:50] went off and I pulled the trigger
[1:31:51] trigger nothing went off and I pulled
[1:31:53] the trigger nothing went off when I held
[1:31:55] in the air and fired it it went off when
[1:31:56] I held in the air and pulled the trigger
[1:31:58] it went off went off not here but up you
[1:32:01] can't tell me God don't ordain lives
[1:32:05] even our Prophet attempted his own life
[1:32:07] to be taken to
[1:32:10] God I made the
[1:32:12] decision I lost everything Ministry went
[1:32:16] to nothing didn't know any brothers
[1:32:17] didn't have any Fellowship got death
[1:32:19] threats got bad letters it got so bad
[1:32:23] financially I went from being Supreme to
[1:32:26] nothing that they repossessed my two
[1:32:28] vehicles they repossessed my house move
[1:32:31] five kids and a wife into a 15t travel
[1:32:34] trailer only because I was willing to
[1:32:38] accept this
[1:32:39] message would you do it again brother
[1:32:41] Hall in a heartbeat in a heartbeat cuz
[1:32:45] everything that was taken from me God
[1:32:47] has returned it back a h hundredfold
[1:32:50] over and over and
[1:32:54] [Applause]
[1:32:56] over so since
[1:32:59] 1989 to this day I have studied and
[1:33:03] preached the message of the hour and
[1:33:06] preached around these states and
[1:33:07] preached in 40 countries and I'm telling
[1:33:10] you I wouldn't take nothing for my
[1:33:11] journey now but I know where God brought
[1:33:15] me from and if you will be real with
[1:33:17] yourself tonight you can see that when
[1:33:19] you were even out and sin you can see
[1:33:22] the hand of God was on your life if you
[1:33:26] wouldn't mind could I just share a
[1:33:29] little just a little thought and then
[1:33:30] I'll
[1:33:32] close Exodus chapter
[1:33:34] 12 I got several scriptures I want to
[1:33:37] join right in here Exodus 12 and verse
[1:33:41] 30 uh 46 if you want to stand for this
[1:33:44] reading of the
[1:33:45] word is this okay
[1:33:48] tonight I wanted you to know who markall
[1:33:51] was where my journey has been and what's
[1:33:53] brought me to where I'm
[1:33:56] at it wasn't without a fight it wasn't
[1:33:59] without a
[1:34:00] battle but I wouldn't take nothing for
[1:34:02] my
[1:34:03] journey and all my kids have served
[1:34:06] under my
[1:34:07] Ministry and almost we got 11
[1:34:10] grandchildren and one to be here in
[1:34:12] December God's been good to me in Exodus
[1:34:17] 12 and verse 46 in one house shall it be
[1:34:22] eaten and thou shalt not carry forth alt
[1:34:25] of the flesh abroad out of the house
[1:34:27] neither shall you break a bone thereof
[1:34:32] listen to that thought neither shall you
[1:34:34] break a bone
[1:34:38] thereof St John chapter
[1:34:41] 19 and verse 36 St John 19 verse
[1:34:49] 36 St John 1936 for these things were
[1:34:55] done that the scripture should be
[1:35:00] fulfilled a
[1:35:02] bone of him shall
[1:35:06] not be
[1:35:08] broken father thank you for this word
[1:35:12] thank you for this church and this
[1:35:13] church family thank you for these lives
[1:35:16] that have stood the test of time who
[1:35:18] have their own testimonies God I just
[1:35:21] ask that you would help me with this
[1:35:24] gift to get out of the way and speak to
[1:35:27] the heart tonight we need your help Lord
[1:35:30] we ask in Jesus name amen you have your
[1:35:34] seat just a thought I goingon to hold
[1:35:36] you we find that there's a prophecy of
[1:35:40] an ordinance that going forward after
[1:35:44] they come out of Egypt that when they do
[1:35:47] the Passover each year not a bone of
[1:35:51] that Lamb's body is to be broken we find
[1:35:55] that David speaks also about the bones
[1:36:00] of Jesus and not one bone of his body
[1:36:05] shall be
[1:36:07] broken then John said these things were
[1:36:11] written or prophesied in the scripture
[1:36:14] that not one bone of his body shall be
[1:36:18] broken then we find in Luke example in
[1:36:22] Ezekiel 37 where the spirit of God's
[1:36:25] upon this Prophet he's carried away in
[1:36:28] the spirit and God tells him to prophesy
[1:36:32] to these
[1:36:33] bones and he asked him he said son of
[1:36:36] man can these bones
[1:36:41] live can they live again and he says oh
[1:36:45] God thou
[1:36:49] knowest bones why is the scripture in
[1:36:53] many places talk about the Lord's body's
[1:36:57] bones and speaks about Ezekiel Israel
[1:37:01] scattered with bones why is it so
[1:37:05] important brother Hall well let me tell
[1:37:08] you a bone means
[1:37:11] strength a bone is the structure of the
[1:37:16] whole man bone means power imobil
[1:37:21] ability for movement a bone is the
[1:37:25] framework made up of a many member body
[1:37:29] a bone is unity and every bone is
[1:37:34] connected to a
[1:37:37] bone but coming from the
[1:37:40] scriptures a bone spiritually
[1:37:44] speaking means
[1:37:47] promise it means promise we find in
[1:37:51] Genesis there the setting where God
[1:37:56] brother bam said that God had
[1:37:58] attributes he was a father but nothing
[1:38:01] to father he was a Healer but nothing to
[1:38:04] heal he was a savior but nothing to save
[1:38:09] then we find that this despairing
[1:38:11] longing for Fellowship God would make
[1:38:15] Man In His Image and as time would go on
[1:38:19] he realized that when he was absent not
[1:38:22] walking in the cool of a day with Adam
[1:38:24] that Adam long for Fellowship so what
[1:38:29] would God do would he take something of
[1:38:32] another substance no he is going to show
[1:38:36] Redemption right here in Genesis 2 the
[1:38:40] Bible said the Lord God caused a deep
[1:38:43] sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[1:38:47] he took one of his ribs everybody say
[1:38:51] bone and he closed up the flesh thereof
[1:38:55] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:38:58] from man made he a
[1:39:01] woman and brought her unto man and man
[1:39:06] said this is bone of my bone what was
[1:39:11] Adam saying he was saying Eve you're my
[1:39:14] promise you're as much a part of me as I
[1:39:18] am of you why because woman bride was
[1:39:23] taken out of man and the Bible said he
[1:39:27] said your bone of my bone Flesh of My
[1:39:31] Flesh therefore shall a man leave his
[1:39:35] father and mother in Cleveland to his
[1:39:36] wife and they shall become one flesh in
[1:39:41] essence who was Eve she was him she was
[1:39:45] him she was she was taken from a part of
[1:39:48] the original creation he amen and Satan
[1:39:52] would put his nasty foot on this Earth
[1:39:55] amen vicariously and enter into the
[1:39:58] serpent brother bandam said it was not
[1:40:01] it was not Satan himself but it was
[1:40:04] Satan's Spirit behind the voice and
[1:40:09] deceived Eve amen and then we call call
[1:40:13] what cause the fall and there Adam was
[1:40:16] with his wife who had become educated by
[1:40:19] the tree of knowledge of good good and
[1:40:21] evil she's come back to introduce it he
[1:40:24] had a choice to make amen he could have
[1:40:26] said hey God start over I got another
[1:40:29] reib give me somebody else but he
[1:40:31] couldn't do that because she was part of
[1:40:35] him and what was eeve to Adam Eve was
[1:40:39] Adam's
[1:40:41] promise Eve was Adam's
[1:40:46] promise the Bible said that Jesus will
[1:40:48] be formed in Us in the in the the series
[1:40:51] adoption number two the prophet of God
[1:40:54] said now he wanted to put things in time
[1:40:57] amen he had he had made something to
[1:41:00] worship so his attributes produced this
[1:41:04] then he made a man then in this man he
[1:41:07] looked Lonesome so now to know now his
[1:41:11] great mind what he had his picture of
[1:41:14] Christ and the church what was happening
[1:41:18] with Adam and Eve God had pre plan that
[1:41:21] same thing with the bride and
[1:41:25] Christ he said that he took not a
[1:41:29] different piece of clay and made a woman
[1:41:32] but he took from the side of Adam a rib
[1:41:35] and took from the spirit of Adam the
[1:41:38] feminine amen and he put that part
[1:41:41] inside that bone who was made of Eve
[1:41:45] like in Eden where there Adam and Eve
[1:41:48] was in the beginning The Same Spirit
[1:41:50] their names was called Adam he was both
[1:41:54] Adam and Eve together and when was he
[1:41:57] separated to go the test what happened
[1:41:59] he fell by the word that was the word
[1:42:03] Adam went after her to redeem her but he
[1:42:06] couldn't do it he didn't have the
[1:42:08] antidote he didn't have the the the
[1:42:10] blood he didn't have the pure blood he
[1:42:13] was vow amen so what was Adam willing to
[1:42:16] do he was willing to die for his bride
[1:42:20] that he might could redeem her he wasn't
[1:42:23] going to separate himself from her
[1:42:26] because she was his
[1:42:29] promise she is bone of my bone she is
[1:42:34] Flesh of My
[1:42:37] Flesh then Paul is going to look by
[1:42:40] inspiration being a prophet he's going
[1:42:42] to pick up that incident amen and Paul
[1:42:45] is going to say it this way in Ephesians
[1:42:47] 5:28 he said so ought men to love their
[1:42:51] wives as their own bodies that's a lot
[1:42:54] of loving men Lord that's a lot of
[1:42:57] loving and he that loveth his wife
[1:42:59] loveth
[1:43:00] himself for no man ever yet hateth his
[1:43:04] own flesh Amen to that but nourish and
[1:43:07] cherish it even the Lord the church and
[1:43:10] then Paul would say for we are
[1:43:13] members of his body of his flesh and of
[1:43:19] his
[1:43:22] Amen on son on Adam could not deny Eve
[1:43:26] no more than God can deny the
[1:43:29] elect you came from
[1:43:32] him amen so then can we go on Bones is
[1:43:36] in the Bible Jesus said look look with
[1:43:39] me in Psalms 22 and 1 and verse 12 and
[1:43:43] 14 22 and one see if this sounds
[1:43:47] familiar now David remember Christ
[1:43:49] hadn't come yet but but David's going to
[1:43:51] prophesy and he's going to say my God my
[1:43:56] God why hast Thou forsaken me why art
[1:44:00] thou so far from helping me and from the
[1:44:04] words of my roaring look at verse 12
[1:44:08] many bulls have compassed me strong
[1:44:11] Bulls of Bastion have beset me around
[1:44:13] they gaped upon me with their mouths as
[1:44:16] raving and roaring lons now what's this
[1:44:18] verse I am poured out like what this is
[1:44:21] Christ and all my
[1:44:25] bones not
[1:44:27] broken out of
[1:44:30] joint so to you moms that's got children
[1:44:33] that ain't in church they're not broken
[1:44:36] they're just out of
[1:44:38] joint Hallelujah not one bone of his
[1:44:41] body shall be broken and David said that
[1:44:44] his bones cuz when they would beat him
[1:44:46] with the cat of nine tals two Roman
[1:44:48] soldiers on either side but unlimited to
[1:44:51] re resources of whipping a man ever how
[1:44:53] long they wanted to they they they
[1:44:56] annihilated his flesh they annihilated
[1:44:58] his body amen then we find out David
[1:45:01] said his his bones would be out of joint
[1:45:04] they cannot be broken why it is a
[1:45:07] prophecy because bone in the Bible means
[1:45:11] promise and God will never break a
[1:45:14] promise that he has given to the
[1:45:16] church everything he says he can buy it
[1:45:20] up and will bring it to
[1:45:23] pass it means to me there's a verse that
[1:45:26] says not one bone will be broken and
[1:45:29] that's where we read in Exodus and quite
[1:45:32] interesting that in Genesis chapter 50
[1:45:35] Israel had engaged and come to the end
[1:45:37] of the road with a leader called
[1:45:39] Joseph Joseph had gathered the children
[1:45:42] of Israel together and he said look you
[1:45:45] make me a
[1:45:49] promise that you you don't leave my
[1:45:52] bones in
[1:45:55] Egypt amen and here's the promise God
[1:46:00] will surely visit you they're waiting on
[1:46:03] a prophet they're waiting on a deliverer
[1:46:06] they're waiting for Jehovah to come down
[1:46:08] amen now remember Israel lived over here
[1:46:10] in the suburbs in the place called Goan
[1:46:13] amen and over here was Egypt amen so
[1:46:16] sometimes in those 430 something 30
[1:46:19] years they get discouraged amen but
[1:46:22] somebody say come on over here look at
[1:46:25] this box what it looks like just a bunch
[1:46:27] of Bones to me no no them bones are a
[1:46:31] promise there's a promise on them bones
[1:46:35] amen that one day God will surely visit
[1:46:41] me he had a
[1:46:43] promise
[1:46:45] bones and he said he said in verse 25 he
[1:46:48] took the oath he made on promise don't
[1:46:51] you leave my bones in Egypt you going
[1:46:53] you're going out of here and this is the
[1:46:55] promise God will surely visit you how
[1:46:58] many times in Despair and discouragement
[1:47:00] did they get down amen they wanted to
[1:47:02] quit but as long Brother Jay as they
[1:47:05] could see the bones they had a
[1:47:10] promise and this is true this is true we
[1:47:15] find that Jesus would go to the whipping
[1:47:18] post you know what's odd what's odd to
[1:47:21] me is we always talk about the
[1:47:24] crucifixion and the bleeding of Jesus on
[1:47:27] the cross but we forget to fail to
[1:47:30] realize he didn't shed blood just one
[1:47:33] time Pastor he shed blood seven
[1:47:37] times the first time he would be eight
[1:47:40] days old amen it's called circumcision
[1:47:44] and it meant he had need of a redeemer
[1:47:48] the second time he would shed blood is
[1:47:50] when he'd go into the Garden of
[1:47:53] Gethsemane and the Bible said that his
[1:47:55] sweat become as great drops of blood
[1:48:00] what was he doing that blood was shed
[1:48:02] for a Deliverance to pave right back our
[1:48:05] prayers to the throne of God that we
[1:48:07] don't have to go through a man we can go
[1:48:10] straight to God the third time he'd shed
[1:48:13] his blood they had a post about so high
[1:48:17] amen theyd lay our Lord across that post
[1:48:20] into his gut TI his wrist to his ankles
[1:48:23] two Roman soldiers with a cat of nine
[1:48:25] tails that weighed 200 lb and bringing
[1:48:29] those 200 lb of velocity those leather
[1:48:32] straps would go into our Lord's body
[1:48:35] they didn't rip it up they pulled it to
[1:48:37] shred his back why was that Bloodshed
[1:48:40] for brother Hall by his stripes we are
[1:48:45] healed they were there then put a robe a
[1:48:48] purple robe on his body put a cross on
[1:48:51] his back bear him up gala's hill and
[1:48:54] when he got up there that robe had
[1:48:57] become a
[1:48:58] Band-Aid they pulled that robe off his
[1:49:01] body to reopen the blood amen what was
[1:49:04] that for brother Hall he said I'm
[1:49:05] married to the
[1:49:07] backslider he's a god of a second
[1:49:10] chance then they would take the crown of
[1:49:13] thorns and they were driving to his
[1:49:15] skull amen what was that Bloodshed for
[1:49:18] brother Hall every demonic every Power
[1:49:21] of hell that ever fights your mind he
[1:49:23] shed a blood for the Deliverance the
[1:49:26] sixth time he would shed his blood is
[1:49:29] when they nailed him to the cross
[1:49:31] through his hands and through his feet
[1:49:33] never for man to die that way
[1:49:37] again the seventh time he shed his blood
[1:49:40] is when they had pierced his side and
[1:49:43] came blood in water now came to the
[1:49:45] Sabbath day Jesus was still still he was
[1:49:48] giving up the ghost He loyal
[1:49:52] he was dying amen and the Roman soldier
[1:49:54] come up there because by custom after
[1:49:57] they died guess what they would do they
[1:49:59] would break his bones but his bones
[1:50:03] couldn't be broke cuz it represented
[1:50:05] something to the church it represented a
[1:50:08] promise not one bone not one promise he
[1:50:12] ever gave will be
[1:50:15] broken they could not break his bones
[1:50:18] because there was a propy that said not
[1:50:21] a
[1:50:23] bone will be
[1:50:26] broken two more and I'll let you
[1:50:29] go
[1:50:31] Samson the Philistines he was anointed
[1:50:34] he was raised up by God to kill the
[1:50:37] Philistines to deliver Israel they came
[1:50:40] against him one day and Samson reached
[1:50:42] over and grabbed a
[1:50:43] jaw
[1:50:45] bone and picked it up the Bible said
[1:50:48] heaps upon heaps what what's that mean
[1:50:50] brother Hall that means he was cracking
[1:50:52] through a half inch skull shoving their
[1:50:55] bodies and piling them up one two three
[1:50:59] he had done slew a thousand he had heaps
[1:51:01] he had piling them up heaps upon heaps
[1:51:03] he had done pile them up brother my call
[1:51:05] away amen and then he takes the bone his
[1:51:09] promise and he throws it
[1:51:12] away how many of us have done that we
[1:51:15] let go of the promise we let go of the
[1:51:17] promise that God said you are my child
[1:51:19] you are my seed start believing what God
[1:51:22] said you
[1:51:26] are God said go get the
[1:51:29] bone GL to God he reached down and
[1:51:32] grabbed the
[1:51:33] bone he held it up and God clav the
[1:51:36] whole Supernatural water came through
[1:51:40] that hole of that bone the promise was
[1:51:42] poured out upon him and the Bible said
[1:51:45] his
[1:51:46] Spirit
[1:51:48] revived because bone is a
[1:51:52] promise Elijah's leaving the
[1:51:55] scene and he asked Elisha would asked
[1:51:59] Elijah what would you have me do he said
[1:52:02] dude I've seen you
[1:52:03] operate I've seen you work I want a
[1:52:07] double portion of what you
[1:52:08] got he said youve asked a hard thing but
[1:52:11] so be it when you see me go away take
[1:52:13] the man on well Elisha is on his
[1:52:17] deathbed one Miracle there was four of
[1:52:20] Elijah he would be eight he's got seven
[1:52:23] he's dying and the King joash comes to
[1:52:26] Elisha and he says he says the king says
[1:52:29] to to Elisha said hey tell me about our
[1:52:33] deliverance he said take your bow Heen
[1:52:36] take your era put it in Elisha got
[1:52:38] behind him and put his hands on his
[1:52:40] hands drew the era and shot it out the
[1:52:43] window he said now take the era and smot
[1:52:46] it on the ground and the King said one 2
[1:52:49] 3 three and Elisha got Furious he said
[1:52:53] you should have spin five or six times
[1:52:55] and you would annihilated that that that
[1:52:58] company amen that nationality but
[1:53:00] because you've only spit three times you
[1:53:02] only got three
[1:53:04] victories Elisha dies one
[1:53:08] Miracle short of fulfilling the promise
[1:53:11] of a double portion God fulfills This
[1:53:14] Promise whether you're dead or you're
[1:53:16] alive the mobites had invaded the city
[1:53:19] and when they invaded the city the two
[1:53:21] Israelites had a dead body and they were
[1:53:23] going to bury it but when the mobites
[1:53:25] got to chasing them they were looking
[1:53:26] for a place to stash it and there was a
[1:53:29] hole there and so they just dropped that
[1:53:30] by dead body right down in that hole but
[1:53:33] little did they know they dropped that
[1:53:35] body down on the bones of Elisha and
[1:53:40] when that body hit the bones of Elisha
[1:53:43] he jumped back out why because bones
[1:53:47] made
[1:53:48] promise
[1:53:51] so let me say
[1:53:53] tonight your bone of his
[1:53:56] bone and flesh of his
[1:53:59] flesh brother bandam said that a man can
[1:54:03] go a long time and not recognize he's a
[1:54:05] Son of
[1:54:06] God I
[1:54:08] did I did but I can see God's Trail and
[1:54:11] God's hand all the way on my life up to
