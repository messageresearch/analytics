[45:12] to minister to you this morning and I
[45:15] also bring you greetings from our people
[45:18] uh back
[45:20] home now I would like to just pick a
[45:24] little some little
[45:27] subject and um as we open to the Bible
[45:31] on 2 Corinthians chapter
[45:35] 5:1 2 Corinthians chapter
[45:46] 5:1 and also Ecclesiastes 3:1 2
[45:50] Corinthians 5:1 reads for we know that
[45:53] if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[45:55] were dissolved we have a building of God
[45:58] and a house not made with hands Eternal
[46:01] in the
[46:02] heavens Ecclesiastes 3 one to
[46:07] everything there is a season and a time
[46:11] to every purpose under the heaven amen
[46:15] may God add blessings to reading of his
[46:17] word as we take our
[46:21] seats
[46:24] now I want to title my
[46:28] message seasons
[46:32] change seasons change but with
[46:36] a subheading or a
[46:39] thought bodies that
[46:43] die and bodies that don't
[46:48] die
[46:54] amen rightfully we know that for sure
[46:58] that we have
[47:00] seasons in the whole year from January
[47:03] to December we have
[47:06] seasons some have three seasons some
[47:09] have summer autumn winter spring some
[47:11] have summer and winter depending on
[47:14] where you are settled in this part of
[47:18] the globe and this seasons were ordained
[47:21] of God for a purpose that's why we see
[47:25] right there in Ecclesiastes chapter
[47:27] three to everything there is a season
[47:30] and a time to every purpose under the
[47:33] heaven so in other words when God set
[47:35] out Seasons he set out purpose for every
[47:40] season there is a purpose that God wants
[47:42] to accomplish and while we see these
[47:45] Seasons also changing from Summer to
[47:49] Winter to Autumn to Spring there is also
[47:52] seasons for our lives that change from
[47:55] time to time amen we don't go just in
[47:58] one season but our seasons of life also
[48:01] changes families of Seasons you have
[48:05] seasons whereby everything is moving on
[48:07] smoothly but you come to a season also
[48:10] where things are just STP stey upside
[48:12] down there's Seasons when you are
[48:15] enjoying good health but there is also
[48:17] season when you are sick there is
[48:19] Seasons also for individuals there is
[48:22] Seasons when you are in job and there is
[48:25] season that you're out of job job and
[48:27] all those Seasons you find them in all
[48:30] aspects of Life the same applies we have
[48:34] seasons also for an individual you have
[48:36] seasons also for a
[48:39] church churches have their Seasons they
[48:42] Seasons when everything is okay but
[48:44] there is Seasons also that we go under
[48:47] trials but God has prepared those
[48:50] seasons for a purpose amen we don't
[48:53] shine Seasons because we don't have
[48:57] capacity to shine them but what you can
[49:00] do as a Believer is to try and comply
[49:03] with season because when you try to
[49:06] fight season you suffer the consequences
[49:09] Hallelujah say maybe is is the hot
[49:13] season and then you say no it's not hot
[49:16] you take a heavy jacket on you you take
[49:18] a heavy shirt on you the next time thing
[49:21] is you sweating the next thing is you
[49:23] collapse the next thing is you die
[49:26] because you are fighting season so you
[49:29] better comply with season God is seasons
[49:33] for your life amen amen when it becomes
[49:36] the hot season you should also put on
[49:39] light cloths amen you should
[49:41] also uh throw away your jackets but when
[49:45] it comes to the H H winter season you
[49:48] say I'm a strong man I don't put on a
[49:50] heavy jacket and the next thing is you
[49:53] shivering the next thing you are cold
[49:56] the next thing you have pneumonia and
[49:58] the next thing you die why those are the
[50:02] consequences of not complying with
[50:05] Seasons so seasons are such that they
[50:09] are forced upon us and when they are
[50:11] forced upon us we have to comply with
[50:14] season no doubt in your life my brother
[50:17] I don't know what season you're going
[50:19] through but some are going through the
[50:21] season of mouring some are going through
[50:24] the season of comfort that's why there
[50:27] you see to everything there is a season
[50:30] and a time to every purpose there is a
[50:33] time to die there is a time to leave
[50:36] there is a time to be comforted there is
[50:38] a time to gather there is a time to
[50:40] throw away those are the seasons of God
[50:43] and we have got to watch carefully when
[50:46] those Seasons come in God's word there
[50:49] is always what God says about our
[50:52] Seasons amen when we are in our seasons
[50:55] of sickness God has got a word of us oh
[50:59] here you oh Israel the Lord your God
[51:03] Health all your diseases them that
[51:05] believe they shall lay their hands upon
[51:08] the sick and the sick shall recover
[51:10] that's a word for the season of sickness
[51:13] amen amen when you lowed down and cast
[51:15] down when you think no one knows me when
[51:18] you think no one knows love don't that
[51:21] no one loves you no one sees you but in
[51:24] that season God has a word for you that
[51:28] God his eyes is upon the sparrow His Eye
[51:32] Is upon every creation His Eye Is upon
[51:36] the end and I want to declare this
[51:38] morning the eye of God is upon you no
[51:41] matter what season you are going through
[51:44] no matter what season you are suffering
[51:46] no matter what season lays ahead of you
[51:49] but God is right he is there to comfort
[51:53] the bered he is there to give soless to
[51:57] those who have lost their loved one it's
[52:00] a season of mourning it's a season of
[52:03] crying but God is right there to comfort
[52:06] amen amen no wonder why then the Bible
[52:10] shows that comfort
[52:13] you one another with these words so the
[52:18] Lord has got words of comfort he knows
[52:22] at some point we need to be comforted he
[52:25] knows at some some point we we we we are
[52:28] weak at some point we are crying at some
[52:31] point things are not moving well but he
[52:34] says wherefore Comfort one another with
[52:37] these words amen amen as much as we have
[52:41] words to say as much as we have things
[52:44] to give as much as we have cause to help
[52:47] with but he said Comfort one another
[52:51] with these words what Comforts us is
[52:54] God's word amen amen that's first
[52:57] Thessalonians 4 verse 18 wherefore
[53:00] Comfort one another with these words oh
[53:03] in the season of morning in the season
[53:05] of bement in the season of heaviness
[53:08] comfort you one another with these words
[53:11] that's why verse 13 of First Corinthians
[53:14] 4 says but but I would not have you to
[53:17] be ignorant Brethren concerning them
[53:20] which are asleep that you sorrow not
[53:23] even as others which have no hope amen
[53:26] so in that season some sorrow without
[53:30] hope but there are some who sorrow with
[53:33] a hope but those who sorrow with the
[53:35] hope they are comforted by these words
[53:38] and Paul says I don't want you to be
[53:41] ignorant if you choose to be ignorant
[53:44] yourself then you can just be ignorant
[53:46] but you don't have to be ignorant you
[53:50] have to be comforted by his word when
[53:52] you come into God's house when the
[53:55] minister stands to minister
[53:57] is to give comfort and soulless for
[54:00] those who feel heavy for those who feel
[54:04] the loss amen amen
[54:07] amen so he says if we believe Jesus died
[54:10] and rose again so even them also which
[54:13] sleep in Jesus will God bring with them
[54:16] so when you lose a loved one you can
[54:18] feel so sorrowful you can feel so bitten
[54:21] down but he says because Jesus died and
[54:25] rose again amen so if your loved one has
[54:28] died and gone to be before the Lord when
[54:31] Jesus comes he will bring your loved
[54:35] ones all you need is to be honest
[54:38] sincere before God then you know you'll
[54:42] be able to meet One of These Fine days
[54:44] so our source of comfort is in God's
[54:48] word amen amen we understand it's a
[54:52] change of season you cannot fight season
[54:56] you cannot withstand season you cannot
[54:59] run away from season but when season
[55:01] come you got to comply so as Christians
[55:05] how do we comply with our seasons of
[55:07] life we comply with our seasons of Life
[55:10] by the word and through the word amen
[55:14] amen
[55:15] amen and there Paul begins to mention
[55:19] that we who are Liv shall not hinder
[55:22] them who are asleep he is talking about
[55:24] those who have gone on before us that
[55:27] though they are safe and sound in the
[55:29] Lord but there is two groups there right
[55:32] who go into the change of body the one
[55:35] who sleep in Christ and the ones who are
[55:37] still alive we who are alive shall not
[55:40] hinder them who have gone who are dead
[55:43] in Christ who are asleep in Christ amen
[55:47] those dead in Christ shall rise first
[55:51] amen amen and then we who are Al second
[55:54] group shall be change in the twinkling
[55:57] of an eye then we shall go to meet up in
[56:00] the air and together we shall go to meet
[56:03] the Lord and the scripture says when we
[56:06] see him we shall know him why shall we
[56:09] know him because we will be in a body
[56:13] which is just like his he comes down in
[56:16] a glorified body and we because of the
[56:18] change we are also in those bodies so we
[56:21] will see him as he is and he will see us
[56:25] also as we are amen so we have a hope to
[56:30] comfort one another with that at least
[56:32] one of these five days there is going to
[56:34] be a gathering in the air there's going
[56:36] to be a meeting in the air Hallelujah
[56:39] Redeemer Jesus we are going to meet my
[56:42] brother this Stone and T body cannot be
[56:46] able to hold up that which God has
[56:48] prepared for you so this body has got to
[56:51] be changed this body has got to be
[56:54] transformed for when you die this body
[56:57] will lay it in the ground am because
[57:01] this is dust amen first God created man
[57:04] in his own image he was a spirit man but
[57:08] then he formed that man of the soil and
[57:12] he breathe the breath of life amen
[57:14] that's what when we go to the Grave we
[57:16] say dust Thou Art and unto dust shall
[57:19] thou remain this is for this natural
[57:23] body but for the soul which came from
[57:26] God which is the gene of life which is
[57:30] your representation because you're
[57:32] either represented from on high or you
[57:35] represented from the pit of Hell so what
[57:38] happens here is you are represented
[57:41] somewhere amen and I thank God with you
[57:44] and I we are represented from on high
[57:48] amen amen So when you say d Thou Art and
[57:52] unto D shall thou remain that's this
[57:54] body that was not say to the soul but
[57:57] the soul goes back to the owner because
[58:00] that's the gene of life that's the GTI
[58:03] Gene of God that's the life that God
[58:06] imparted unto you am amen so do you see
[58:10] that my brother my sister so you see in
[58:14] Seasons as seasons change the seasons of
[58:17] Our Lives also change we have the season
[58:20] of mortal life the season of mortal life
[58:23] is the season when we are living this
[58:25] body of life
[58:26] this house of glay One of These Fine
[58:29] days shall best wide open One of These
[58:32] Fine days shall give up oh I'm looking
[58:36] forward for a day when I give up this
[58:39] body and that body that's waiting for me
[58:42] I go into it no sooner do I step out of
[58:46] this body I enter into a Heavenly Body I
[58:50] enter intoh that Celestial body and
[58:54] Heavenly Body so when you die you don't
[58:58] just move around like a spirit but there
[59:00] is a body that's waiting for you and
[59:03] that body that's waiting for you is that
[59:05] one whereby it cannot get sick that one
[59:09] cannot get tired that one cannot get old
[59:12] I am longing for that body I am longing
[59:16] and ending for that body whereby I will
[59:18] never be sick whereby I'll will never
[59:21] die whereby I'll never have gray hair
[59:23] whereby I'll never get tired all that
[59:26] day is coming
[59:28] Hallelujah so you see right there we
[59:31] have mortal bodies which is our natural
[59:34] bodies where we stay so we have the
[59:36] season of natural bodies the season of
[59:40] mortal life in the season of mortal life
[59:43] we get married in the season of mortal
[59:45] life we have wives in the season of
[59:48] mortal life we have children in the
[59:50] season of mortal life we go to work in
[59:53] the season of mortal life we get old we
[59:56] get tired we get young in the season of
[59:58] mortal life because we are governed by
[1:00:01] time amen as time moves our bodies show
[1:00:06] how much time we have moved amen amen
[1:00:09] that's a season but my brother my sister
[1:00:12] there is yet another season when we step
[1:00:15] out of the season of mortal life we step
[1:00:18] into the season of Immortal Life
[1:00:21] Immortal Life is a life that cannot die
[1:00:24] Amen in other words when you have
[1:00:26] eternal life then you cannot die in that
[1:00:29] body my brother my sister we stand in
[1:00:32] his presence in that body We Are Forever
[1:00:36] More there Hallelujah no more bad
[1:00:40] thoughts no more bad ideas why because
[1:00:43] we are in the season of immortal life
[1:00:47] amen now in that in that season we don't
[1:00:51] stay natural houses in the season of
[1:00:54] mortal life you stay in your house which
[1:00:56] is built of morar which is built of
[1:00:59] dager but in the season of immortal life
[1:01:03] you don't stay there he says in my
[1:01:05] father's kingdoms are many mansions how
[1:01:09] can a kingdom have in my father's house
[1:01:11] are many mansions how can Mansions be in
[1:01:14] a house that is a domain that is a
[1:01:18] kingdom in my father's kingdom are many
[1:01:21] borders in my father's kingdom are many
[1:01:24] houses that when you step out of this
[1:01:26] house you go into that house no wonder
[1:01:29] why Jesus said oh he says about his body
[1:01:33] destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will
[1:01:36] raise it up some thought he was
[1:01:38] referring to Solomon's Temple yet he was
[1:01:42] referring to his own body so when you're
[1:01:44] speaking about the temple there he
[1:01:46] speaking about your body amen so we have
[1:01:51] another season that's coming that's a
[1:01:53] season of immortal life that's a season
[1:01:56] oh because everything has got Seasons
[1:01:58] amen amen even Ministries have got
[1:02:01] Seasons you've got them in their High
[1:02:04] season and they go into their middle
[1:02:06] season and they go into their Pig season
[1:02:09] amen life always has got his season you

[1:02:15] middle there and then you come now to
[1:02:17] the Old Stage amen it's seasons of life

[1:02:24] prepared us for each stage of the season
[1:02:27] of life amen hallelujah amen so you see
[1:02:31] right there as seasons change we comply
[1:02:34] with the change of season oh this
[1:02:36] morning it is my prayer that God can
[1:02:39] undertake for you also that if you're in
[1:02:41] the season of sickness that God can be
[1:02:44] able to heal you in the name of Jesus
[1:02:47] Christ we want to bind all sicknesses we
[1:02:50] want to evict all sick sickness and
[1:02:52] disease in Jesus Christ's name you be
[1:02:57] delivered why God has a better season
[1:03:01] for you and the better Seasons where you
[1:03:04] can enjoy your good health oh my brother
[1:03:08] my sister maybe you are too long in your
[1:03:11] season you are not married but you want
[1:03:13] to be married God can change your season
[1:03:16] God can be able to Grant you a a a a a
[1:03:20] partner for Life a husband for Life a
[1:03:23] wife for life can he can change your
[1:03:26] season amen maybe youve been looking for
[1:03:28] a job for too long but you canot get a
[1:03:31] job somehow but God can change your
[1:03:33] season and give you yet a job to live by
[1:03:36] amen amen maybe you've been looking for
[1:03:38] a breakthrough you want the baptism of
[1:03:41] the Holy Ghost you feel that I want more
[1:03:44] and more of God it's a season God Can
[1:03:47] Break Forth That season before you and
[1:03:49] give it to you amen amen seasons change
[1:03:53] amen allow the change of season don't
[1:03:57] continue in yesterday's season you need
[1:04:00] a season of
[1:04:02] today when you take breakfast in the
[1:04:04] morning it's one season but you cannot
[1:04:07] take breakfast at 12 12 noon you have to
[1:04:11] take lunch because it's now another
[1:04:13] season so a season dictates to you what
[1:04:17] you are to feed upon what you are to eat
[1:04:20] on and when you come to supper you
[1:04:23] cannot take lunch because it's another
[1:04:25] season the same applies in our lives
[1:04:29] like in this time we are living in the
[1:04:31] end times time is far spend we are
[1:04:34] living the closing moments of life of of
[1:04:37] this world things are top stey why it's
[1:04:41] another season it calls upon us to be
[1:04:44] ready I want to be ready I want to be
[1:04:48] ready to walk in Jerusalem just like
[1:04:51] John it's a season when we need to eat
[1:04:55] that word like never before it's a
[1:04:58] season when we need to be persistent
[1:05:01] like never before it's a season when
[1:05:04] we've got to come to church like never
[1:05:06] before it's a season when we've got to
[1:05:09] praise him like never before it's a
[1:05:11] season where we've got to be honest like
[1:05:14] never before it's a season where we have
[1:05:17] to look up to God like never before
[1:05:20] Hallelujah of Jesus that's our season
[1:05:24] amen when people are finding no use to
[1:05:28] save the Lord we are saying this is our
[1:05:30] season amen though we are getting gray
[1:05:32] haired we will saving all the same if
[1:05:35] the young people refuse to save him we
[1:05:37] will save him with our gray hair until
[1:05:39] we rest it's another season my brother
[1:05:42] you better say Lord help me I don't want
[1:05:45] to miss my season I don't want to miss
[1:05:47] the season of the hour I don't want to
[1:05:49] miss what God has prepared for us for
[1:05:52] this day amen seasons change amen amen
[1:05:56] amen and when season change you have to
[1:05:59] comply with season you have to move with
[1:06:02] season so there is a time to be born
[1:06:06] there is a time to die there is a time
[1:06:08] to plant there is a time to plant now
[1:06:10] there is nothing wrong with each one of
[1:06:13] these Seasons amen but it's when you
[1:06:15] don't know why that season has to be
[1:06:18] there that's why you are
[1:06:20] worried it's a time to plant but after
[1:06:23] planting you're waiting for the time of
[1:06:27] pling Amen so when you get to understand
[1:06:30] that in planting God has a purpose in
[1:06:33] pling God has a purpose that comforts
[1:06:36] you to know that is all moving according
[1:06:39] to season amen so season is a time frame
[1:06:44] in that time frame once you fulfill
