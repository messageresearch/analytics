uh end we the service would be 930 9:30 sometimes we have at 10 but 9:30 look forward to communion and feet washing that night so it's 9:30 that's say is the 31st and we'll be bringing in that's on a Sunday night so new year will be on the Monday okay so by the grace of God telling youe of time God bless you 4 and 13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not is even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus would God bring with them for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shower with the voice of an archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord God bless the read word you may be seated I want to talk to you tonight about the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord he said in the F 15th verse this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them that asleep the saints that died in the Lord and went to sleep they because we know uh uh child of God cannot die but he said whosoever liveth and believe in me shall never die that's why Jesus said my friend that latter sleep and they said if Lord if he do sleepeth he doeth well and he said he said he's sleeping and I'm going to awake him and then they didn't understand he he said lers is dead amen so he went there and he realized lers was dead and they all were crying and Jesus even wept but he knew that when they said they'll see their brother again at the latter day and so forth and Jesus told them that I am the resurrection he not that I shall be but I am present tense and just as much as he said that then he send and now we're looking forward to the coming of the Lord some looking forward to the Rapture the Rapture means to be caught up the word rapture is not in the Bible some people are debate it and they'll tell you no such thing as Rapture is not in the Bible but we're just talking about being caught up the so sometimes people strain at a KN and they swallow camerel but it means to be caught up the Bible says we'll be caught up together to meet the Lord amen we which the 17th verse says we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them caught up together with them in a the clouds last night at Mullins I was talking about the cloud but I don't want to get so far in talking about the cloud because you know the prophet of God talked about the Rapture in three phases the shout the voice and the trumpet and we realized that the shout was the message and we realized that on Sunset Mountain the cloud came down and he said he was caught up in the consolation of seven angels and he was caught up in the SE constellation of those seven angels and the Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation which to be open and he was to go back and uh God would reveal the Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation so by the grace of God we realize that the message the Bible was a sealed book as Daniel was told to seal it the prophecy of the book until the time of the end I'm taking my time are y'all With Me Seal up the says of the prophecy to the time of the end not trying to get too excited just want to talk to you tonight but we're at that cycle of time but somewhere in the Bible we have to come to the realization that we at the end and if we I we are at the end then the book was to be sealed to the the end time of the end so by the grace of God let's look at um Matthew 24 the coming of the Lord some people you know says the coming of the Lord and his appearance is two different things and we don't want to get into the debate on that his appearance and his coming but nevertheless we know that through the revealed word of the hour that an invisible Union is taking place now and you and I amen that are the Bride of Jesus Christ we're being united and we are being it's a union bride and the Brom groom coming together amen he said the bridegroom cometh the coming of the Lord the Lord is coming the bridegroom cometh but to you and I it's an invisible Union taking place so the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife so he said his wife has made herself ready so when you are not married amen but this reunion that is taking place now God is calling you I show you the bride the Lamb's wife so you and I are not just coming to church and not just saying we're Christians but we realize that there has been a invisible Union the the Lord himself has descended and the prophet of God brings out he bring he does three things in his descension the shout the voice and the trumpet are you with me so we know that if he's descended then where is it he's here he's here in our midst are you with him so if the Lord himself is here then where is he amen the bride and the groom becoming one it's a it it has to be that way are you with me so I'm just talking to you but hope you understand when you listen and study the word for your the hour that you understand who's who you are and what's taking place in the spiritual realm because if there nothing that's taking place with you amen and then you see uh Israel and what's going on over in the Middle East Israel is our time piece and we're watching that seeing what's taking place over there then something is taking place here because the natural types is spiritual so something should be taking place in your midst now God is moving now amen but if he's not moving in you amen then something is wrong so by the grace of God I say I ain't going to get excited because I won't bring out nothing I just get excited 24 and three and as he sat upon the mountain of olets the disciples came unto him priv privately saying tell us when should these things be and what shall be the sign of the what thy coming coming of the Lord when you thy coming now they ask him when shall be the sign of thy coming talking to Jesus right he was there with him talking to him are you with me what should be the sign of thy coming and of the what so if he was that with them now they're talking about and the end of the world so you have uh uh references here that I we we're concerned about when the world going to come to end if they were concerned about the end of the world and we were seeing that the nuclear powers and all the earthquakes and all the things that are taking place shouldn't we be concerned about the end of the world but they were more concerned about the coming of the Lord because they knew that you know if we recognize that the world was coming to the end then we know that the coming of the Lord can get us out of here are you with me so God comes to amen he promised that I I'm coming back for you ain't that right he said don't let your heart be troubled I'm coming back for you but the problem is he want he wants us to be ready when he come are you with me but our Readiness is not depending on what we can do is what he's doing for us amen so the brine makes yourself ready because he inside of you is quickening you and changing you and bringing you to the place you need to be so the as you eat the word amen you become the word are you with me so God wants you to eat on the word I I was just reading my Bible this morning and I said how many people read their Bibles anymore maybe they so busy studying the message I said this Bible it it it it must always become life to you the Bible always got to become I said Lord this how good this word is I said it always don't never let the world become stale or something that you don't need the word God will be you pick up you you read in the morning and read you know you go through the day yeah Lord I'm thinking about the goodness of what your word say Amen because he said servant of God said if you want to get closer to the Lord he said read your what read your Bible and pray so that that's the secret of getting closer to the Lord reading your Bible and pray pray he could said well I want you to listen to my tapes and I want you to study them uhuh he said read your Bible and what pray okay some you know I listen to this court I listen to that's fine but he said read your Bible and pray are you with me and and and don't let nothing take the place of you reading your Bible in your prayer life because if things begin to get in your way and you don't read your Bible and pray you know I I as a young preacher we used should have you know ministers meetings all the time and back you know even before we came into the message and and all the teachers that would teach the young ministers and all they always said you spend more time in prayer than you do studying so they always stress if you're gonna St you spend more time praying that God can give you something to give to people then studying something to give to people always spend most of your time in prayer so it's always an emphasis on prayer where's your prayer life so a as it is to the minister it's also important to your Christian walk that you spend your time in prayer because God will let you know things that are to come come are you with me he'll show you things to come but God can't show you nothing if you don't spend time with him praying are you with me your your your prayer life has to be uh very essential very important to you and you learn amen the moving of God and you learn amen how God you you know he He makes himself it's a relationship and you can listen to God and see if you if you're not praying and really getting in tune with God then you just go through the motion and you're always going to depend on outside help and not him he wants to help you he wants to lead you he wants to guide you he wants to be in control of your life so you must pray are you with me so they said in the end of the world so he he told them many things he said Jesus said Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man what now the first thing I want you to know concerning your questions take heed that no man will deceive you amen for many shall come in my name saying I'm Christ and shall what shall deceive many many people going to be anointed okay and you shall hear of walls and rumors of walls see that you be not troubled for these things must come to pass but the end is what for Nations shall rise against nation and kingdoms against kingdoms and there shall be famin and pestilence and earthquakes and divers places all these things all all the these are the what the beginning of Sorrow if it's any sorrow is happening all over the world cuz these things are happening and all these things are the beginning of Sorrow okay it says then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be what hated of all Nations and you know Israel looks like the victim of that and as Israel is the victim in the natural people of God and out of all the religions of the world Israel the Jews are spotlights just in that little place called Jerusalem and Palestine in that area the Jews uh you know all nations got their eyes on Israel it doesn't matter how how they uh killed those people over in the Israelites I mean the the Jews or whatever the everybody's looking at how many Palestines you killed or whatever so it's a political thing we don't want to get involved in that but we know that as all nations turn and going to hate you for his name's sake so I'm I'm saying you're going to be hated for his name's sake now you think people just going to hate you because you go to church because you say you're a Christian you don't have no problem how many you been hated because you say you're a Christian now it's got to be something that's going to cause folks to hate you amen because your Christianity got to it's got to stand out above and it's got to be something that you you have that that caus them to hate you you know the Pharisees and the Sadducees all came together and they United themselves against uh uh Jesus isn't that right and they came against John the Baptist amen they they see what I'm saying once you become United with him in the right kind of way that a persecution follows because light does not have fellowship with Darkness if you for real and you mean it for real and you want Jesus for real and you're not playing around and playing games uh folk come to church they come to bride Tabernacle they go to church and they say I'm message Believers and all of that but you know if you're really for real you going to go through something it's going to be a different your life must be a different because why it's an invisible union he he he's going to come in and appear in the cloud and we're going to see his corporate body but he has appeared to you as an individual in the form of the revealed word of the hour and that's your mate are you with me so you must recognize amen Who You Are God has revealed himself to you as an individual that's been a uniting you and the word becoming one amen when and and the rest of the world look at it who are you I I I got many scriptures here but like I said before that's what that was the problem the even the woman said Lord we know when the Messiah coming you know what I'm saying we know when the I cometh and she didn't know what was going on neither does the rest of the world know what's that going on now because uh that woman they was expecting him to come and he said when he come she said when he come he will tell us all things are you with me he would tell us all things so it was something about him telling all things he said because she said shall I proceive that you a prophet and when you when you come you'll tell us all things so when she Jesus said I'm he she ran and told it that comes to a man that told me what you think he told her all things amen that ever I've done are you with me see what I'm saying once a word strike you in the right kind of place and God reveals himself to you in an intimate way it goes down deep amen it changes your whole life it makes a difference to you praise God it brings you out amen of a religious spirit amen I she didn't have to come to that mountain no more amen praise God because Jacob build the well amen praise God and neither in Jerusalem but he said the hour cometh and now is amen that the true worship is going to worship me in spirit and truth brother and sister it's coming a time when you're going to worship Him in spirit and truth it doesn't matter what folk say but you got to get in him praise God and you're going to worship God in spirit and truth you're going to come praising the Lord your eyes ain't going to be on Amen I'm tired I'm I'm going worship God in spirit and Truth amen God I love you I found myself in the hospital just you know preaching praying preaching Lord I love you and brother Jones right that with me I said and he repeat going right on I said to we wake up this whole Hospital shake up this Hospital amen so by the grace of God but I I I you know you you you you can't hold you know this thing back now you got to be bold soldiers you got to you got to you can't hold back letting folk know amen I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the power of God under salvation to everyone that believe praise God Hallelujah don't be ashamed of your testimony so I'm not going to get into the depths of you know about the Fig Tree and he said now 32 32 he says he said now learn a parable 24 and 32 he says now learn a parable of fig tree when his branches is yet tender and put it forth at leaves you know that some is not now the fig tree is Israel Israel had not been a nation for over 2,000 and something years they were cut off and they were carried into uh the Jews were carried into Babylon and then the the the 10 tribes are scattered in the Syrian and so forth and it was just scattered abroad but as far as them coming together as a nation they wasn't a nation they weren even reckon among the Nations they were scattered people but God said in Ezekiel 37 son of man can these bones live and he said Lord God thou know it he said prophesied to the bones said oh you dry bones hear the word of the Lord and the Israel came back together in 1946 The Prophet said but in the reckon among the nations in 1948 Israel came back after being off the map as a nation for over 2,000 somebody said 2500 years they came back to be a nation are you with me when Israel came back to be a nation let me let me read this and show you what he's saying uh the the Fig Tree when you see the Fig Tree put it forth the leaves know that summer is what n amen so we getting a little closer we if you read the rest of that chapter it says some is n so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it's what you know that it's near even what even at the door see it's closer it's at the door now now if it's been at the door since 1948 and he said then he went on to say in the 34th verse that's why everybody just about that new Bible prophecy and studyed the Bible in 88 they was looking for the world to come to an end and the Rapture to take place and all and and everybody was anticipating how many of you was born in in 88 most of y'all weren't born in 88 how many of you wasn't born in 88 and after the Raptor with it to place y'all would have minut you see what I'm saying y'all wouldn't have been a part of it so what happened God held up the Rapture for y'all you know what I'm saying because he said here in the 34th verse verily verily I say unto you this what and they said the generation usually is 40 years okay cuz they the the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness how long 40 years right and the the young people that was born in the wilderness they went over into the promised land but all the people that came out except Joshua and Caleb even Moses died there you know what I'm saying and the they died except Joshua and Caleb and they went on into the promise so people that studied Bible said 40 years is the generation it says here 34th verse again verily verily I say unto you this generation shall not what pass until what so we I mean 88 and we still here so what what are we saying brothers and sisters God must have waited on some of y'all are you with me he knew y'all was coming and he waited other than that back then we were so stirred up so fired up we thought we were going to heaven I wasn't thinking about getting married CU I'm going to heaven are you with me but we didn't go so Caleb is here Josh and Rachel you see because we were so stirred up because we thought we were gone and then the next st came and uh the next ster big ster coming in the year 2000 because what happened uh it was the seventh day one day is with the Lord is what thousand years and a thousand years is what what did God do on the seventh day okay so 6,000 years so everybody was s oh the computers going to crash world going to come to here and how many years uh uh around in 2000 you 2000 how many of you were wasn't here in 2000 let me see your hand well God waited again on y'all you see what I'm saying must have been held up for y'all some of y'all I see what I'm saying and if he held it up for for you then what what are you waiting on God Amen saw some reason why he didn't let see the seventh day uh God rested from all his Works amen isn't that right and so by the grace of God so they figured that uh the Thousand Years which is God came in Son of Man and Son of God and Son of David see because they asked Jesus The Question Master will th at this time restore the kingdom to Israel uh uh let me let me show y'all uhuh acts one act one I I I know I'm going through too much but I hope you I hope you're getting a little bit if you don't get it all just get a little something he says in the sixth verse Acts 1 and 6 when they therefore were come together they asked him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel right see Israel looking for G the Messiah and when Jesus came to restore the kingdom to Israel and they and pilot put an inscription on his on his head and said what king of the Jews you see what I'm saying and if if he was King then this King was supposed to come rule with a rod of iron and was supposed to restore the kingdom back to Israel are you with me and John came and said repent for the what kingdom of heaven is at hand see it was the kingdom of heaven and they thought it was the kingdom and he was coming as son of David and he came as son of man to die on the cross are you with me and he's the son of God in the church ages through the Holy Ghost but he promised again before the coming of the Lord to come again as son of man Ministry are you with me so he's here again getting us ready for Rapture in faith are you with me because he's getting us out of here we're not just coming to church amen just to be a group of people that coming to church we we we're looking forward to a Rapture amen and that Rapture takes place before the Great Tribulation period when the Great Tribulation period take place then God lifts the Holy Ghost off the earth and the Holy Ghost is gone amen from the church and there are two Jews two two prophets over there in Israel speaking in the Book of Revelation 11 to Israel and that Israel oh I'll show you that in a minute y'all see y'all ready to go home he going too long y'all all right everybody all right okay restore and he said unto them seventh verse it is not for you to what to know the what Time of the Season ain't that right which the father has what on the power now look he put it in his own power and then he didn't leave you there but he said in the eth verse but but I I I'm not going to leave you there he put it in his own power are you with me but I I I'm not finished don't y'all stop there but isn't that right you shall what so how you going to know you shall receive what power power power amen when you get get the power the questions can be answered are you with me but you shall rece receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses of me so he went on to talk about the baptism of Holy Ghost I want you to know the the coming of the Lord is connected with the power are you with me the the rest the restoring of all things of uh restoring the kingdom to Israel is connected with the power of the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost come on you then you God began to open up the season and the time amen now the day and the hour is another thing are you with me but God want you to know what time it is Sir he wants you to know the hour you're living in that we need to get ready to get out of here here but it's got to something you know as you Unite with him and you and him become one amen the prophet said we get so close to him and we'll get so much like him that he can't stay away from us then we'll go up amen even the dead Saints amen uh come up out of the Grave you remember in the first resurrection amen the dead saints come and they walked around Jerusalem and they saw him appeared many are you with me so Amen in the resurrection Grand you said I saw Grandmama last night you said yeah in your dream no I saw her walking she talk to me no you a see no Grandmama so the resurrection how you think the Saints felt when the resurrection took place and they Jesus rose no I don't know whether he rose or not the Bible said many that slept in the dust of the earth arose with him and walked around Jerusalem y'all y'all I need to turn now y'all got it okay so by the grace of God um I'm gonna just get away from this for a minute and um just go to Zachariah 12 and I'm going close because just dealing with the coming of the Lord is and it's something got to go down resumate what inside of us and a stirring of God if the word of God don't stir you up I don't know what else going to stir you up Zechariah 12 and9 Zechariah 12:9 and the Lord Lord shall be king over all the Earth and in that day shall there be one Lord and what oh y'all 14 excuse I mean I said 12 and I was reading 14 excuse me and uh he said excuse me and it shall come to pass in that day that I will what I would seek to destroy what now you know all the nations is going to come against Jerusalem and they almost doing that people are Marching all over the world by the thousands and tens of thousands on all different countries and Nations and they really hate the Jews are you with me just because they are Jews that hate them and you want people to love you because you save and you're a Christian no because your light shine they hate the light your life makes a difference but God is giving you favor God is giving you favor for the season he's holding back the Four Winds he's holding back what they want if they could they would because you you make them you make them feel bad because of your lifestyle they want to talk about all kind of filthy and ungodly stuff but when you you know you a Christian now you know I just thank the Lord that every now and then you find somebody that will give you some respect but it's going to come an hour where that's respect going to be gone amen people ain't going to respect you because you're a Christian they going to hate you because you're a Christian I'm not talking about a church goal I'm talking about somebody that really know God are you with me it's it's it's getting close now okay the natural types is spiritual if they doing it there what about you you said when I stand up I'm against this and I'm against that I ain't G to say these things but y'all know what I'm talking about what you stand against sin amen and people want to sin and they don't want you to say nothing about it they want you to tell them it's all right and they going to go to heaven doing the stuff they do and living the way they live and you you tell them no sir you ain't going to heaven man sister you won't go to heaven looking like that you won't go to heaven brother doing the stuff you doing you're not going to heaven oh man you condemn me Jud the I say judge you not no the word judge you I didn't judge you are you with me the Bible judge Jud you God judge you judgment begin in the house of God okay I got to close Okay let me see and I will pour out upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and what supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have what whom they have pierced and see now how in the world they going to look upon him whom they had pierced except they look in this word and see what they have done are you with me you think Jesus is going to say look upon me whom you pierc no those true prophets going to be preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and they going to recognize that Jesus is the one that we crucified and kill whom you pierc they G to say oh and they're going to repent 144,000 of them and they're going to be killed because they accept the gospel are you with me and and and that's what I'm saying people look for Jesus to come in a corporate body but Jesus comes in the form of the word and they can't recognize him because the Bible said in the beginning with the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word was made flesh are you with me so when Jesus come in the form of the word they're looking for him to come the coming of the Lord Jesus is come in the form of the word but you didn't recognize Jesus because he was in word form are you with me but he always came that way when you saw Moses come it was a God that was in Moses amen and fulfilling the word that was spoken by the prophet Abraham Isaac and Jacob that God said you're going to discern you're going to be in the land for 400 years after 400 years I'm going to deliver you are you with me so what happens is when God comes in the form of the word the coming of the Lord the Lord come down I'm come down to deliver them but God didn't come he sent Moses are you with me and see when when when the Lord comes in the form of the rapturing of the bride and getting the church ready for Rapture the Lord comes according to the word but we missing because some sometimes he's veiled he's veiled in flesh just like you and I amen as the Bride of Jesus Christ they don't believe that you amen a m Jesus Christ amen you don't they don't believe that because they didn't believe he was and they can't see amen but you it's because of what you believe you see and you believe you've accepted amen what the blood oh that was shed for you him whom they pierc and it says and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that in bitterness for his first born and in that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the morning of ha da in the valley of me I'm telling you it's all going to be over after a while and will you be ready uh for the coming of the Lord if he comes in word form would you recognize him and I said he has come as he said said Lord we thought that Elias was first come and restore all things and he said I'm telling you Elijah has come already and you missed him and that was John the Baptist that he's talking about are you with me but he said Elijah shall first come and restore all things and he comes to restore all things in this hour but who going to believe that P he didn't believe John he cut his head off neither do people think we don't need you we got Moses Abraham Isaac and Jacob I'm saying brother and sisters it comes a time when you as the Bride of Jesus Christ wake up and see amen God is soon to come this thing is getting it's getting rough some of the news reporters they said that America is backing up from Israel and the nations are getting the little that's back in Israel they it's a lot of pressure getting out there it's a lot of pressure they want to be they want to want to stick with them but it's a lot of pressure it's a lot of chaos going on you got to know where you standing you got to know what's going on you got to know that you got to keep your eyes on Jesus and and your walk with God you got to know that any time this thing can break wide open and if it does where you going to be if it does happen God only knows I want to keep my eyes on Jesus and I want to be ready for the Rapture because all of this I can so I said well you you're saying that the Jews are right and Palestinians wrong I getting involved in all of that all I know is that we got to be ready are you with me I'm not getting involved with the Palestines with the Jews all of that I said you got to be ready are you with me said brother Simmons you know you need all that political stuff all the political world Satan got control over with all of that amen but God people shall be delivered and that's what we got to be concerned where you standing with God how's your life how you living have you have you done the things you know to do are you don't just come to church get to know God don't just come and sit and listen and ask the preacher ask God to lead you guide you to open the word to you amen God
