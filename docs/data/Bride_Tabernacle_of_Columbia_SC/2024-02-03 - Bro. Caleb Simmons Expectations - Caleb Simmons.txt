those that may just be listening Lord speak to every need tonight in Jesus name we pray amen [Music] amen amen if you have your Bibles you ask you turn to the Book of Luke Luke Chapter 2 I think it's verse 25 if you got it say amen amen and it reads and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was uh was just in the vout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for my eyes have seen thy salvation which thou H has prepared before the face of all the people and a light to lighten the Gentiles and a glory to thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother marveled at these things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed him and said unto Mary his mother behold this child is set for the the fall and Rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which was spoken against ye a sword shall pierce through his own soul also and that thou and that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed amen God bless the readings of the word you may be seated amen tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled expectations expectations and you look in the word of God and you see that Simeon he wasn't just waiting on a promise that God had given him he was expecting something he was expecting that one day he was going to see the God that was going to be of Salvation And so Simeon he got there and it was not only told to him it was it was something that he knew down in the inside in the inside of him that he knew was true it wasn't something that somebody had told him it was something that he believed in see when you believe in something you know that it's true it doesn't matter if somebody told you or not you can expect and know that it's true said he said now one thing that I read and said now look at Simeon he said now he had to believe something more than you believe cuz you think about what Simeon was going through Simeon was believing something that he didn't even know was true he had no experience of what was going to happen there was no thing it was just written down he had no expectation to go back and read it and see that it happened he had to believe something more than we believe cuz he had to believe in the impossible he had to believe in the unexpected and see he had an expectation that what he believe was going to come to pass he had an expectation that I could set and say I can believe that this is going to happen because the Lord spoke to me because the Lord spoke to me I can believe that it's going to happen I can take it by faith and go go on with it and said he said now can you do that he said now the same holy ghost that led Simeon is the same Holy Ghost that's here tonight there's not two Holy Spirits are there there's just one Holy Spirit see this the same God that's doing things over and over again to prove to you and I that he's still God said I can go to God and I can expect God to do what he said he would do cuz he said he's the same yesterday today and forever he said he's the same God that can do the impossible said now they're getting healed but Jesus Christ so Christ had never come to Earth see Simeon had believed in a God that he had never seen he had to believe in a God that that only had spoke to him he said Jesus hadn't even come to Earth yet and still Simeon was waiting on God to be revealed to him he was still waiting there and I thought about it I said you know it wasn't just him waiting he was in the right place he wasn't waiting here there in the field he was in the right place when he was waiting on God to show up he was in the right place and not only that he was expecting God but he was doing something he was doing something while he was expecting God he might have been reading he might have been praying he might have been studying but he was doing something he was about his father's business said you might not know what may happen but you can always be about your father's business you can always go and you can ask God lord what would you have me to do Lord what would you you have me to do he said Simeon but it was prophesied that he would come see Simeon believed in a prophecy he believed that that Jesus was going to come and Simeon had the promise of the Holy Ghost that he was going to see him said Simeon knew that he was going to see him said now go all God always had someone that believed his word God always had someone that believed his word amen are you a Believer tonight amen are you a Believer tonight amen amen so somebody's going to expect God to fulfill his words while other pass it by now it was in that day so it is now the church has gotten formal and gotten away from God so we look into the world today and we can see many things happening in church many things that we might not have thought or expected but they're happening in church but it says somebody's going to expect God to fulfill his word somebody's going to have an expectation that God will do what he said he would do said somebody's going to have have an expectation that God is going to come judge his people cuz God he whipped them out of the temple when they were doing wrong in his house see they going to have an expectation that God is going to set things right God is going to do a work and then nobody can say it was him or it was them it was only God that did it cuz God knows the thoughts and the intents of the heart see God you got to have an expectation that God knows what he's doing God knows what he's doing and if you expect God to do something he'll do it if you expect God and I was reading that you must believe that all things are possible to him that believes but be expecting God to deliver you for he promised it and as soon as your faith can catch up it's gone away as soon as your faith can catch up to what you believe and you don't doubt it it'll it'll go away and and that's right and now whatever you expect that's what God will do amen whatever you expect it's not what mother or sister or brother expect it's what you expect whatever you expect that's what God will do see I can stand on that whatever I expect that's what God will do see I expect God to move in my life so I'm going to watch him do it all I got to do is expect God to do it and he will show up it may not be when you want it but he'll be right on time said whatever you expect that's what God will do said said be expecting God to deliver you for he promised it and as soon as your faith catch it can catch up it's going away said see you got to believe in what you expect God to do you got to have faith and not doubt cuz he said if you have the faith of a mustard seed it can move mountains say how many mountains have you moved with your faith if you have faith of a mustard SE it'll move mountains how many mountains have you moved with the faith in your life said God re will reveal himself to those who are expecting him how many are expecting him tonight said God will reveal himself to those that are expecting him and you look in the Bible and you remember when Jesus was born that there was the Magi that were out and said the Magi they were expecting to see the star of Jacob rise there were many people out there but they was expecting that star to show up they was searching they was watching the skies they was expecting in that star to show up and they were from the East and they listened to Bam's prophecy which said there would be a star of Jacob rise and they were looking for it there was they were expecting it and they were the ones who saw it see not everybody saw that star but they were expecting it and they saw it so everybody might not see Jesus but if you are expecting you'll see him if you are expecting God then you'll see him if you are looking in the right right place and you're in the right place you'll see God cuz you're expecting him to be there he said when two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be in the midst so when you come into the house of God you should expect God to be there cuz he said I will be in the midst he said I will be in the midst so you can expect God to be there but it's according to what you expect I was reading something and it said you know if you were looking for a fault you the devil surely show it to you the devil surely to you but that's what you expected when you walked in the door you expected to find something to be wrong but if you were expecting God to show up he'll meet you there if you expecting God to do something he'll meet you there if you were expecting God to move in your life he'll meet you there you were expecting God to heal you he'll heal you you were expecting God to deliver you he'll deliver you because it's whatever you expect it's not what your mother your sister or brother what you expect so you got to show up with an expectation that Lord I need something from you Lord I need you to move in my life Lord I may need a healing and Lord I'm expecting you to heal me Lord cuz you said by your strikes we are heal so it's already done but I'm expecting to see the manifestation of your word in my life and my body and my home and my family Lord I'm expecting and that I know that you'll show up and do what you said you would do it said and how and how many tonight expecting to be healed see let's see your hands and said well you're not going to be disappointed cuz if you you just can't be dis disappointed if you're expecting it said you're not going to be disappointed then if you just can't be disappointed if you're expecting it if you're not expecting it then you say well I'll wa maybe tomorrow afternoon I'll get it tomorrow well that's when you'll get it so whenever you expect it that's when you'll get it so if you going to take that test and you expecting to maybe get a beat guess what you going to get you going to get that beat you probably should have asked God to do give you an A and you probably would have got it because it was given to you for what you expected not for what anybody else expected what you expected God said I can do all things he there ain't no limitations on what he can do he said now now you got to put in the work and study now he ain't say just show up he he said you got to do something in order to get it but once you do it you can expect God to show up and and fill in the gaps where you might be missing say Jesus said according to your faith be it unto you according to your faith said some sometimes you look and you say why isn't things happening but it's according to your faith it's what you're expecting is what when you walk in do you believe that God is going to do for you say everybody some people may feel the Lord and may be in a you say you come to service you see sister so and so oh the Lord really touched her oh the brother so and so the Lord really touched him and then you looking around and say Lord why didn't you touch me and the Lord said what did you expect what did you expect you just showed up and said I'm going to church tonight and you came and plop down on the Pew and you didn't expect God to do nothing for you so what God what should God do for you your expectation is so low that God said H okay I guess you didn't really care I guess you didn't really want nothing so he'll let you go on but it's sometimes you got to elevate your faith it's according to your faith it's not according to the preacher's faith and sometimes you may get in the prayer line and and get prayed for and say why am I not healed it's according to your faith said the preacher doesn't give you healing but one day when your faith catches up to what you expect things will happen for you things will move in your life that you might not have done thought and God can do exceedingly abundantly more than you can ask or think but it's what you expect it's according to your faith he said Simeon he said could you imagine Simeon was there and could you imagine some of those Scholars said don't pay no attention to the old fell I believe he's just he's got old now and his Minds kindly went away from him said you know Simeon was over there maybe for years and years waiting on this child to show up he you might have seen hundreds of thousands of children be born and come to that Temple but he was still waiting cuz there was nothing there that had told him this was the one there was nothing there he his expectation was still elevated and high because he was waiting on his promise he was waiting on a promise that was delivered unto him it was delivered unto him said people might have picked Adam and said he done got old now and his Minds kindly went away from him and the poor old fell he's a good old man but you know old man like that isn't going to why you looked at him for age and looked at the condition of the world today why why we know he isn't coming now said they might have looked around and said you know he going to pass away before he see this you see how old he is you can imagine you know sometimes when you see an elderly person sometimes you say okay and they tell you something you know the Lord is soon to come the Lord is soon to come like sister Oar told us every day the Lord is soon to come but you know sometimes you get away from that expectation that the Lord is soon to come because you're living life you're doing things and time is passing and you look back and you say they've been saying that all my life the Lord is soon to come all my life I've been hearing that the Lord's coming soon but say you know what you won't be in the right place if you don't expect him to come you won't be in the right condition if you don't expect him to come you won't be ready when he comes if you're not expecting him to come so sometimes you got to get ready before the thing happens to you see Simeon wasn't out plying the field he was in the place to meet where the Messiah was going to be he was exactly where he was told to be because he knew that one day he was coming it might have been 10 15 20 30 45 years before he seen him but he was in the right place to see him said but if you're not expecting God to come back then you conduct your life you may conduct it a certain way you might not have no urgency to your life you might not be urgent to you know I got to get to the house of the Lord cuz you know one day they said we won't get to go but you see you're just living because you've been hearing things all your life but one day if they do happen then you say well then you're going to try to catch up but it might be too late so what are you expecting say you got to set your expectation some sometimes times in in life you change your expectations you might have set a goal and said you know what this month I want to save this much well when you hit your goal the next month you said well I can do that and maybe a little bit more so you change your expectation sometimes you got to update your expectations and and as the world grows and things are going on sometimes you got to re-evaluate what am I expecting I got to re-evaluate when I go to the house of the Lord what am I expecting am I expecting it to be like it was the last time sometimes we get that mindset you know I don't want to well I guess and then sometimes you got to come and say Lord It's not according to them and it's according to my faith say I can be the one lick of fire that calls God on the scene I can be that one lick of fire that catches the rest of everyone on fire but it where does it start it starts with you it starts with me it starts with with the person from the back door to the front door but each and every one of us you can Elevate somebody you can take it and say Lord take this fire that's in me and Lord let it burn and Lord let it not be hidden but Lord you may come and let it grow Lord breathe the Breath of Life onto this breath of on this little liquor Fire Lord and let it grow so it'll shine more for you it'll shine brighter for you and said they were looking at Simeon and his age and they looked at the condition they said he uh he's still saying that he going to see it but said Simon had one reason that he believed said the Holy Ghost had revealed it to him sometimes you may go to church but it ain't till it come revealed to you that you don't understand said when you when it's revealed to you that Jesus is soon to come oh you take off with a world of fire behind you you said Lord I got to get right Lord I got to get ready cuz you're soon to come and when it clicks to you one day you say oh all this don't matter none of this right here matter and this one talking and that one it don't matter cuz Jesus is soon to come said sister o she said it every day Jesus is soon to come that's all she had to say but she said that Jesus was soon to come because it was revealed to her it was something that was deep down on the inside that she knew beyond the Shadow of Doubt that God was soon to come that sometimes you got to set your expectation Lord I know that you're coming so Lord help help me get ready Lord I don't want to in that moment I don't want to be getting ready I want to be ready but if this is my day to get ready Lord get me ready cuz Lord I don't want nothing stopping me I don't want nothing hindering me I don't want nothing that I'm thinking in my mind to stop me Lord from going over lord I don't want to be looking at this one or that one Lord I got too much to worry about myself Lord I can look in my own life and say Lord I need help Lord I'm expecting you to do a work in my life see it's according to your faith he said he Simon but Simon had one reason that he believed that is the Holy Ghost had revealed it to him there's the thing God had told Simon that he wasn't going to see death until he had seen the Christ he wasn't going to see that see Simon had an expectation that it's the Simeon he had an expectation that he that God was going to do what he said he would do Simeon had an expectation that he was going to that God was going to do what he said he going to do and and Simeon believed in it there was no doubt that this was going to happen cuz if he had doubt he probably would have left a long time ago those that believ for a season when the opportunities change they go after opportunity but when it's revealed to him so deeply and so strong he stayed in his place and stayed in his position until he saw the Lord until he saw the Lord and he believed that what the Holy Ghost said was the truth said he believed that what the Holy Ghost said was the truth say Simeon he had changed Simeon he might have been living life but when that was revealed to him he changed his expectation he changed what he was expecting God to do he changed what he was walking in and going in and in his path of Life maybe and he changed and said I got to go to that one place cuz I know right there that's where I'm going to see him and he might have stayed there for years but he said I got to stay here until I see what God promised me said sometimes you may go left or right but sometimes you got to stand still and know that he is God you got to stand still and know that he's the same God you got to stand still and know that he can do the the things that you asked him to do cuz he's the same God I said in the old church before we came over here I said we used to have something on the on the wall behind the pull pit anybody remember what it said it said expect the supernatural says sometimes we got to go back to expecting God to do the supernatural so we got to go back to expecting God to do the Supernatural cuz he's the same God he didn't change he didn't change so what's the difference it's what we expect from God to do see he's the same God and it's what we expect God to do said I wrote down I said all we expect in the L Lord Lord to return and if you are what are you doing to prepare yourself for his coming and said what about those that are around you says sometimes you you don't go witness him because because you don't think the Lord is soon to come your expectation is that's far down the line but what if he came tonight would you be ready if he came tonight would you be ready said that you look down and he said you may not know the day or the hour but you can know the season say said that sometimes it said what are you expecting from God what are you expecting of the Lord you can see the signs of the time and you might think that it's we still got time but what are you doing to prepare yourself for it's coming excuse me said none of us are too old or too young for God not to for God not to move in our lives say God can move in your life no matter what age you are God can come down and all it takes is you getting down and say Lord I need your help Lord I I'm expecting something from you Lord I'm expecting you to move in my life you don't know what that may do for the people that are around you to see you crying out and say Lord I need you I need you I don't need someone and it may be all alone in the lonely night and all the lonely hours God sees those things God said he captures the tears that you cry see God hears every prayer but you got to believe and you got to have faith that what you ask God to do he'll do it said set your expectation on what you ask God to do and he'll do it said you can expect the impossible because he's the god of the impossible said said I expect God to do things but do I hold on to what I expect God to do do I hold on and I stand firm on on what I expect God to do cuz if you expect healing he'll heal you he said when your faith catches up then it'll be gone just like that and I believe that God will do the things he can if he held up a plane to meet a mother's prayer what can he do for you if he if he went down and he can heal the blind eyes what can he do for you if he can raise the dead what can he do for you I said none of us are dead in here today so what else can he do for you if you got life health and strength that's more reason to expect God to do more cuz he is able to do exceedingly and more than we ask or think so sometimes we have not because we ask not and when we ask we ask a Miss but Lord I'm expecting you to do what your word said you would do Lord I'm expecting you to show up cuz you said in your word that you would show up Lord I'm expecting you to move because you said in your word you would move Lord you gave us examples that I can believe and have faith that Lord you're going to do exactly what you said you would do cuz that's what I expect of you God and you said your word cannot return unto you void and said he's a God and I change not so if he can't change then I can keep expecting if he can't if he don't change then I can keep believing I can have faith that God will do exceedingly and more and more and that each and every day he can take me higher and I can believe more each and every day I might only have the faith of a mustard seed but if I keep believing it'll grow if I keep believing it'll grow next long I ain't got no Mustard Seed Faith I got a stalk Faith a little plant start to grow next thing I know I turn around and I keep believing and I keep believing next thing I know I got a little tree forming and it's growing and it's getting taller not only is it getting taller it's getting stronger and now I'm starting to believe God to do more and I turn around and there's some leaves forming on the tree next thing I know there's some branches forming on the tree and this tree is getting stronger it's growing higher and it's growing taller next thing I know I'm I can put barely put my fingers around it and see my faith is growing because I'm watching what God is doing in this tree I'm watching how God is moving and growing this and say it's just that small you look at the oak tree and you don't see the acorn but it was there and you look at it and say Lord I can expect it because all it takes is a little faith to move mountains it don't take much it take a little faith to move mountains so Lord if I can expect with my little bit of Faith Lord Jesus with my little bit of Faith what can he do for me if I can expect with maybe my little bit of meal and my little bit of oil what can he do for me he supplied it all through the whole drought season but what could he do he sent a he sent a prophet to come by just because of a little bit of Faith with a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil he said that's all that God needs he don't need you to come and make drastic changes God will do all the changing all you got to do is believe he don't expect you to go from night to day God to do all that for you all you got to do is believe that he is God and that he can't and they don't change and he can do that in your life that's all you have to do but you got to expect God to do it you got to expect God to do it you won't get what you don't expect you won't get what you don't expect because God is the god that he just wants you to have a little faith that I and then he then he can turn around and you may look and say I told you I would do it cuz that's the god that you serve that's the god that we serve I said I got to expect more from God I got to expect you can expect God to fill you with the Holy Ghost CU that's what he promised you but you got to expect the god to do it first you got to believe and be saved and be baptized and then he said the gift is that you shall receive the Holy Ghost but see whatever ever you expect that's what you'll get whatever you expect so if you don't expect it you'll never get it but in in this day and age you got to expect God to do CU you don't know what tests and trials may come your way you don't know what God may put in your life to prove that he is God but sometimes you got to expect that he's the same God that can move mountains he's the same God that can stop the Sun and stop time he's the same God that heals and delivers because Lord it's whatever I'm expecting you to do I can believe that you you'll do it [Applause] amen praise God Amen what are you expecting amen I expect it amen I expect a miracle amen do I have it amen if you believe you have it you got it praise God you don't have to see before you believe you believe before you see and if you believe it you can see the glory of God so we thank God for the word you appreciate the word tonight let us stand tonight thank God for brother Kelly brother Kelly come on up here and say something yeah y'all can sit back down let brother Kelly s God bless you brother praise the Lord praise the lord we said praise the Lord praise the Lord you know I was sitting there rejoicing brother because I just preached that message last Sunday I knew it was the Holy Ghost you know I kept put brother Simms kept coming on my heart and uh I was riding now then and uh I stopped and a little light flashed up on my truck and I said Lord now I know you spoke to my heart and I said if this light is on then I need to on on and turn around so I got there and I pulled out my book and see what it the problem might have been and uh I went in the store and then I came back and I fired the truck up and uh got there and you know it's light was out so when the light went out so I know the Lord wanted me to keep coming and then you know he met me back there and uh I knew uh right now that it wasn't a time but I knew the Lord was leading me here at this specific time uh you know but not not over preaching the what he preached but expectation is a great thing you know you're talking about when you come into the house of the Lord we the only one know that the impossible is possible is that right so we come expecting great things he told us to ask and ask abundant abundantly is that right you know when you come into the house of the Lord we got to realize in this age here now that we're just the bride of Christ and brother forgive me cu the anointing don't drop down in here and you got to understand who you are and whatever you ask if my word abide in you and you abide in me whatever you ask you can receive it is that right you know it you know s brother he couldn't even go nowhere is that right the Bible say he couldn't even go nowhere is that right because God had made a promise to him and he was an old man at the time he took a lot of persecution at the time uh but Simeon was it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost uh as the precious brother said when you see the young ministers rising up and studying the message of the hour he's catching a hold of it it's not a man is that right it's Christ in the Holy Ghost form back on the scene again and we got a great God we serve a mighty God we serve a miraculous God of and what he ask you know when you come in the house of the Lord is like he said in the old church you got to expect the Supernatural is that right you see it in the mirror every day when you wake up it's in us we see the body changes is that right we see him changing us we don't appear to be anything right now but the Bible say we're going to be just like him but you know when the man sat in the gates called Beautiful he sat there for 40 years is that right brother Kaleb he said he was expecting that right he got to the to the point where his faith was so low all he was expecting was money is that right arms when he sat in the gate but the gates of beautiful men it was an appointed time uh and that a point in time when Peter and John saw him at the gate he forgot about in the house of the Lord his salvation he forgot about the house of the Lord it was Deliverance he forgot about in the house of the Lord it was healing he was gaed about in the house of the Lord it was Miracles they come and don't make it
