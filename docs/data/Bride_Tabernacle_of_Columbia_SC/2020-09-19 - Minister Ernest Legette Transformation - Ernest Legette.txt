the hungry i pray you feed them those o god that are in need i pray you'll meet all their needs thank you lord in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] god is good amen tonight by god's grace i just want to look at romans 12 and 1. god is good amen [Music] romans 12 and 1 and it reads i beseech you brethren by them by the mercies of the of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may be that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect the will of god may god it bless to the reading of his word you may be seated tonight by god's grace just for a moment i want to miss it to you on a little subject that uh lord put on my heart and ministered a couple of weeks ago and i entitled it transformation amen transformation looking here in the scriptures how you know it's something that the lord he doesn't want us like he says i don't want you to conform but i want transformation you know to conform be you know to just fit in or or by abide by the laws or do whatever you know it takes just to blend in but god doesn't want us just to blend in come on we have a lot of that in the church world where we just want to blend in come on but he says i don't want you to conform be don't be conformed to the world but he says i want you to be transformed and paul said it like this about a renewing of your mind so tonight we want to talk about a transformation you know i like how hearing the scriptures how he says you know present your bodies he says a living sacrifice holy and acceptable you know it's it's some things that we look at how you know how he says i want you to present it i want it to be acceptable god you know all praise isn't accepted by god all worship isn't accepted by god sometimes we give god what we think we we can we want to give god but you know we find out that god ain't going to just accept anything but he wants uh uh you to come his provided way or he wants an acceptable sacrifice come on i think about cain and abel and how cain just gave god the fruits of the land but that wasn't what god wanted come on and he even told them if you do what they will do he says i'll accept you you'll be accepted god wasn't going to just accept anything sometimes we wonder why you know god isn't blessing us so we've been rejected come on because we're not giving god what's acceptable come on he says a living sacrifice uh uh it says holy acceptable unto god you know i think about it i was meditating on the lord and how the children of israel you know at one point and many times they just gave god anything he talked about one time by the tables he says they're full of vomit he talked about in malachi how he says you're bringing me a lame the lame and and all these things to my table you just giving me anything he says and i ain't gonna accept it he says i'll tell you what he says give it to your governors or give it you know to to like we say the boss man on the job but give it to the people of the world around you and see will they accept it come on and if they you look at it he says he says if i be a father he says if you won't give that to your natural father and i being a father he says where is my honor he says you won't give it to your natural masters and i'm being a master he says whatever he says come on i'm not accepting that so we find that you know they try to give god anything but he says you know he says give it give it to the to those and and see what they accept come on but we find out that many times you know i says god that's why we were saying uh uh to ourselves praying that lord we want to find your will that's when we say lord we want a word from you the word from you that we get we want to know where you're leading us we want to know which direction you want to go in we want to know the will of god for our lives that's the word that we want not just to say god gonna bless you with a new car new house come on those things are good but the word that i want is lord your leadership and direction where where do you want me lord come on what do you want out of my life you know i want to give you god what you want that's the word that i need the leadership and direction of the holy ghost how many need that tonight so we find that you know i says you know we're looking here and i i said sometimes he says i want i want i want it i want it to be holy and acceptable you know we find that a lot of things like we said that we give god it ain't acceptable you know i thought about i says you know i was in my car today and i even said it the other week i says you know god gave you two hands you say why you say that because everybody don't have two hands everybody don't have that blessing to have two hands god gave us two hands come on and we won't even sometimes raise our hands to say lord thank you we won't worship god come on now is that acceptable that's unacceptable come on god gave us a voice didn't he gave us good lungs you know some people were born not with good lungs some people had lungs taken away some some just have struggled to breathe but god has blessed us come on with good lungs to breathe come on a good voice that we can stand up and and talk and sing strong but yet we won't even sing sometimes we won't even give god back what he gave us now is that acceptable that's unacceptable and i said that's why he says make a joyful noise unto the lord god gave you a voice and you won't even make a noise unto him that's unacceptable come on he gave your hands and you won't even clap them songs going on we won't clap our hands that's unacceptable come on he says give me what's acceptable hallelujah i think about brother carol used to say that he used to by the testimony about worrying about the shoes that he got on his feet until he saw looked over and saw a man that didn't have no legs come on then he learned come on you know sometimes god knows that we're doing the best we can with what we got come on god knows that sometimes but a lot of times we find out that we ain't doing the best we can with what god gave us but we misused things come on we misused the things that god has given us we misuse uh our time we misuse it and i say that why because it it becomes a rebuke to you because i said lord am and what i am what i've given you acceptable because god says i want you to present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable come on god sometimes open uh pulls back the veil and open the eyes of the people and say this is what you've given me come on in my eyes this is what it looks like come on you this is what i blessed you with and this is all you giving me i think about the ones with the talent he says he gave some this many some that many but and then he coming what it is he was holding him accountable for the things that he gave them for the gifts that he gave them and i says god when god you know god holds you accountable for the gift that he gave you god gonna hold you accountable because some didn't have but they did all they could with what they had come on hallelujah and i said god that's what we want to do lord i want to give you all we to the place in our christian journey in our lives that we know we at the end come on i think about the brother that passed away come on we don't know when the day of the hour gonna come everything might look good today but tomorrow god might require of you what did you do with the life that i gave you what did you do come on with the breath that i gave you then we have to beg you to praise god hallelujah come on the two hands did i have to beg you to lift them up say lord thank you then i have to beg you to clap bring noise into my storehouse come on hallelujah that's unacceptable but god wants to ex god you say he won't reject your praise god will accept it if you've given him all you got how many believe that tonight but we find that i says he he wants he wants things he wants what's acceptable you know i look at hearing how you know he's saying i want you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice you know a sacrifice god always says yes we we're presenting our bodies with sacrifice it ain't easy come on i was ministering on the other week the path to glory you know that pathway to heaven it ain't an easy road it's a hard road it's a lonely road it's a road where sometimes you're gonna have to stand by yourself many times what it is when you go behind there that veil is just you and god and god alone come on many times you know i think about how isaiah said it came the year that king azad died that's when i saw the lord god gonna have to it's gonna be waters of separation it's gonna be times where you're gonna have to walk alone it ain't easy role it's sacrifices that you've got to make but god is calling us to that then i want you to present your body as a living sacrifice you won't lose your reward the sacrifice that you make for god remember you can't give a greater sacrifice than what he gave for you and i come on and i don't believe that we can but we can give god all that we have how many believe that tonight but we find that he says you know a living sacrifice come on it's not that god of begs us or drags us but like we always say makes us free more agents you know and he he's giving you an opportunity to uh like he says i want you to be a living a living sacrifice and many times people they use that terminology that this is this is my life and and and this it may be true in a sense come on but god gave you that life but he still you got a choice that you can make you can choo you you choosing uh the power from the way you going the road that you're traveling down you got to make a choice but remember the choice the choices that you choose i mean the things you choose or the path you choose to go down with that life you're going to be held accountable one day for the choice that you made come on and that's one thing we don't reckon with sometimes that you know the things that we do in this life god gonna hold us accountable we don't we don't reckon sometimes that hey we just gonna slide but like they say when you know better you do better come on when you when god has opened your eyes and show you then he's expecting more out of you come on god when he when he anoints you and bless you you know god is expecting something in return come on how many believe that tonight god is expecting no you can't give god more than what he gave you can't repay god for what he's given to you but god is expecting something in return he's expecting a sold out life he's expecting somebody to testify and tell about the goodness of god and where he brought them from you know many times god can do something for somebody and they won't even tell what god has done for him they sit back and not even acknowledging him come on but god wants you to acknowledge him that he is that same god that he's still alive and well somebody needs to know that somebody need to know that god is still healing somebody need to know that god is still delivering somebody needs to know that the holy ghost is still real somebody need to know that prayer still works somebody need to know that the anointing still breaks jokes somebody need to know that hallelujah god don't just do things for us for us to sit back and just not even come on but god wants somebody to know that he's still lord in the earth how many believe that tonight god is so good that's why we always loved telling our testimony you know i was sharing with one of the guys at work and and how what the lord done for me and where and where it brought me from and i can every time i tell it sometimes a lot of times you can feel the presence of god why because it's what it is you realizing that it ain't nothing that you've done i was sharing with the guy i said you know i was at a place in my life i was at work i said i was at a place in my life where i needed god's help i needed god to deliver me and i said i'm still at that same place right now i need god to deliver me i mean it started i started ministering in my spirit and you know what the presence of god came and something happened in the room hallelujah why because i was giving god the glory and god came down i believe something touched his heart the way he can feel like god did something for him he can do it for me as well and that's the hope that we give in the world that when the world sees you they'll realize that if he did it for him maybe he can do it for me hallelujah glory you know sharing with a guy at work and and just testifying of another guy or something what the lord had done for me and and i said you know that's why i i'd love to press my way through that's why i love to press my way into prayer rest my way into things i said because he didn't have to do it he could have chose to leave me right where i was at i said but he didn't he died for me come on he reached out his hand you always sing that song when he reached down his hand come on for me i was lost hallelujah have you ever been lost i was undone without god or his son but when he reached down his hands for me oh jesus and i reached out i was able to grab that hand and he picked me up out of that mucking that maori clay and i've been running for my life ever since hallelujah you know i was sharing with the guy another guy who worked a testimony he said earnest you almost persuaded me to go to church in the morning and i said the thing is i thought about king agrippa i said i don't want to almost persuade you but i wish that you go on to the house of the lord because the same god that did it for me he's here to do it for you as well hallelujah but what it is come on god using what god gave you come on sometimes we think it's just the ministry or just the great singers or the great musicians come on but each and every one of us you know we can read further down in the scripture and it talks about the gifts that that god has given you and he has no respect of person but you got to use what god gave you to be a blessing to somebody else around you you know that's when the that's where the anointing is because all we're doing all all we're doing is giving god glory all we're doing is lifting him up and he'll draw the men unto us you know it's something you know i always think about in in a song got in my spirit the other day and you know i've been i've been singing it to myself ever since thinking about some trials and tribulations and the little song got in my spirit says that i don't feel no ways tired come on but i come too far from where i started from nobody told me that the road was going to be easy but i don't believe hallelujah he brought me this far to leave me you know i started singing that song to myself and the presence of god came in the car come on and i started feeling like hey i feel like running feel like i'm fresh on the page again starting all over i said when i think about where god has brought me from he brought me too far come on come too far from where i started from get behind me satan want to get in your mind and get you to turn around want to get in your mind tell you too tired come on i come too far from where i started from hallelujah nobody told me that the road was going to be easy god is still here right now he brought me right here to leave me hallelujah but god is still here i believe that hallelujah do it one more time lord i feel like samson do it one more time god call your spirit out just once more lord hallelujah you didn't bring me this far to leave me hallelujah i don't feel tired tonight i don't feel no way he's tired when i look back hallelujah all the storms that i've been through of the rain i think about i believe it was caleb he says i'm just as strong today as i was back then come on god made me some promises he promised me a mountain and that's what i want i don't want to live here without the promises that god made me hallelujah oh jesus come on i want to say tonight you got to press your way into it you know the devil comes to your mind he says i want you to be transformed by the renewing of your mind get your mind right come on i want your mind to be renewed remember that god gave you promises and not one of his promises will fall to the ground but they're just as real today as they was the day that god made those promises all you got to do is reach out with the hand of faith and grab hold to the word and god will bring it to pass how many believe that tonight hallelujah but we find that we're talking about like we say it's being transformed it's something about it it says you know you you can you can live your life the way that you want to desire but remember you'll be held accountable come on you'll be held accountable with the things that god has blessed you with you know and what you did with them come on but i didn't have a beautiful voice but you had a voice i didn't have i couldn't sing the best i could i wasn't able to speak but you had good lungs come on oh hallelujah don't let the tape play where you was in the service and you wouldn't clap your hands don't let the tape play when when everybody was worshiping you wouldn't raise your hands don't let the tape play when something you know the word was speaking to you and you wouldn't say amen don't let the tape play when you know that god was doing something in your life but yet you held back on him hallelujah that was unacceptable i say give god what's acceptable to him tonight hallelujah don't you know we can take off when we realize what god is doing in our midst i believe that hallelujah things happen when you begin to worship things happen when you begin to praise you know i've been sometimes in the prayer clause and the body be weary but then i just start saying thank you jesus thank you jesus sometimes i might just say thank you jesus i might scream out hallelujah all of a sudden things begin to take place and happen down in your spirit why because it's something about you giving god what's acceptable to him you've given him that press that he's looking forward to you giving it to him how many want to give god that tonight come on we're talking about being transformed hallelujah you know it's something about it you know what we find that i says what it is uh uh you know you can't you can't conform unto until that type of worship or that type of prayer you can't conform to it but it's something about you know a transformation has to take place and how does a transformation take place through the baptism of the holy ghost you know we find that many times we can come and many people they conform to christianity they they they come and they conform just to be in church but they never get that transformation you know we're thinking about how when the world was void and it was full of darkness come on but when god began to speak to that world that was void and full of darkness when god began to speak that's what it was when he began to speak transformation began to take place it was a world in darkness without form and without lord but when he began to speak when he said let there be light come on transformation took place when he said let the earth bring forth transformation started taking place come on what it was because almighty was speaking and transformation began to take place don't you know god is still speaking today let the word of god go deep enough into your spirit down to the realms of your soul that transformation can begin to take place many times we hear the word and we said it had no effect on us it's not nothing wrong with the word but it's the ground that's falling on come on let the ground be right when the ground is right and transformation will take place how many believe that tonight that's why we always say god help me create me a clean heart and renew the right spirit in me god i want to hear the word i want it to fall on ground something can happen some can begin changing down on the inside of my soul lord hallelujah transformation begin to take place that's what keeps you stirred that's what keeps you going because something is happening come on down in the deep how many believe that tonight well we find that he says i want i want you to be i want you to be transformed we looked at i said it is something how even the world when it was in that when it was in that stage you know he began to speak transformation began to take place things begin to happen and that's what it is you know many times people you can hear the preacher or you can just read the bible intellectually but nothing seems to be taking place down on the inside that's why it says the letter of kill but the spirit is what gives life come on the holy ghost bringing life to the word doing something picking it up off the pages and delivering it to you then you know we sing the song he's changing me come on from glory to glory he's changing me and that's what it is in our christian journey we are not being stalemate but we ought to be changing god ought to be bringing us from revelation to revelation from glory to glory you moving higher in god what it is it's the word of god transforming you that same god that spoke to a world that was in darkness and full of void that same god is speaking and just as transformation took place then transformation is taking place now people can't understand that you ain't who you used to be they think they know you but they don't understand what god is doing in your life hallelujah they don't understand that it's more than just my shouting and yelling and screaming and hollering but something real is taking place life is is starting to resonate hallelujah and one day we'll do more than just that but we'll be translated out of here how many believe that and i believe that come on moving us into a realm i believe of faith to where you know it's something high in the word of god he said if you would only believe all things are possible come on moving you into that realm to where you just believe all god said come on all things are possible god i'm in need you said all things are possible lord we need healing all things are possible let me think about a testimony someone told me the other day of what the lord done for him i said see he's still that same god he's still that miracle worker he's still doing the same things that he done when he walked the shores of galilee why because he's still god how many believe that tonight but we find that i said what it is he says don't be conformed but be but be uh transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god you know when when the transformation you know takes place in your life you you receive the baptism of the holy ghost it's not just a shout out dance but it's jesus christ a person come on living he comes to dwell in you that is no longer he is no longer you that's living i believe as paul said but it's christ that's living in me a transformation has taken place i am not who i used to be come on it's not that i always been this way well the transformation hadn't taken place yet because when the transformation takes place then all things have become new come on he says be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might be able to prove that which is good the good and the acceptable will of god how are you going to prove that because it's going to be him in you uh uh doing his own will him in you using your feet using your hands doing his will the holy ghost i believe that how many believe that tonight and that's what we want i said lord we sang all the time god fill me up lord come on fill me up until i i i won't thirst no more fill me up lord until my cup run over fill me up lord until the i i like how the song says consume me lord with the fire of your spirit come on i don't want none of me lord but all of you god fill me up lord let the holy ghost fall let the fire fall let the rain come down lord that we can prove what's the good and acceptable will of god hallelujah that's the only way we're going to get out of here that's the only way we're going to be able to to to uh display a perfect love and agape love the love that he wants we got to get out the way we got to die to ourselves and let him live in us hallelujah you know when that transformation takes place it ain't what people doing to you come on because you're dead hallelujah and christ is living in you so it's not about you but it's about him hallelujah and if he can hang on a cross and say father forgive them because they don't know what they're doing if god can forgive them from what they've done to him how about you and i have forgiven each other for what the little things these light afflictions that the devil put on our lives tonight hallelujah i say that's worth my dying it's worth my crying it's worth my living hallelujah it's worth my giving to make heaven my home how many believe that tonight come on i don't believe god brought you this far to leave you i believe god is still with you i believe the same god that picked you up is still right here right now in full majesty and full power in full glory come on god didn't let you down sometimes we let him down i say pick up the pieces and carry on hallelujah i say get on fire again i say start praying like you never prayed before i say start crying like you never cried before we want god to be the same yesterday today forever but we got to get back to where we first believe we got to get back to crying we got to get back to praying we got to get back to fasting and doing what we used to do hallelujah and he'll do what he used to do how many believe that tonight because he's the same god he's the same god and nothing can be taken away from him they say the world has changed but god ain't changed they say i don't see him but he said the world wouldn't see him but he said you'll see me because i don't am i with you but i'll be in you are you seeing god tonight hallelujah you ought to be seeing his power you ought to still be seeing that same miraculous god hallelujah let a transformation take place come on it's it's past that we conform come on just to be regular church members but transformation is taking place hallelujah we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus we get sitting in a company of an of an innumerable amount of angels come on hallelujah you know the atmosphere of faith the prophet of god says it invites angels to come near come on hallelujah do you believe tonight angels should come near i believe praise amen appreciate the word today amen god is good amen god power to transform amen amen it takes the power of god to transform us we can't do it on our own amen it's just like the prophet god told the story as this man was a jew and uh so he was converted to catholicism and they pulled holy war on him amen and he became a catholic amen so after he went through the rituals of becoming a catholic they sprinkled the water on him and went through the procedure and he became a catholic so the man had a ham it was on friday and he sprinkled some holy water on the ham and he said it was fish are you with me but he said him springing out holy water on that ham didn't make it a fish because they probably eat fish on friday so neither does the different rituals and things people do makes them born again make them have the holy ghost amen you got to have a real genuine transformation a real experience with god if you don't have a real experience with god you can do what the church say what the preachers say and you can please a lot of people but you got to come in that place it meant when you surrender all to god and you become one with him a real genuine experience thought about that being born again being transformed being changed from a sinner to a saint being baptized into the body of jesus christ by the spirit of the living god amen not somebody going through a ritual are you with me changing from one church one denomination to another denomination but real experience with god not having some type of thought or some type of creed it's some type a concept but a real experience with god you and god having a real experience we can come to church and we can be faithful to the church but do we have an experience in a relationship with jesus christ are we really born again are we really transformed has god transformed our lives if he did it brother and sister then we would need to walk in the power of trans for formation we ought to walk amen with the new walk amen if any man be in christ he's a new creature there's a new life amen old things have passed away all things become new that's what it
