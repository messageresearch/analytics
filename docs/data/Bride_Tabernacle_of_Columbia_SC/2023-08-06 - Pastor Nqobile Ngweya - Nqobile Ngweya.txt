anything can happen God dwells in the Praises of his people I want to thank our pastor for giving me this opportunities privilege to stand before you ministering the word of the Lord and I want to thank my brother and I we are meeting for the first time and here we've been seeing each other we've been talking online and sister mature and all of you are here may the Lord bless you I'm from Zimbabwe I'm Pastor I'm doctor because in the medical I ran my surgery is about four surgeries then in the spiritual I've been planting churches when you talk of medical that's who professionally I am but when you talk of missionary that's who I am that is see how it's been saying that in the body I may be tired I think um I came with my family this time but I left them in Florida you know sometimes you have to balance Ministry and family so that you don't in the whole world and lose your children so we're to just have a good time in Florida even Disneyland and places last weekend I was ministering in UK and the previous I think Wednesday I was in ministering in Dubai then the other weekend I was in Canada so it's definitely from traveling I've been a bit worn out but I feel like traveling on I do think our pasta and um we'll open our Bible to the book of hakai I don't want to keep you along I'll just think 45 minutes should be good enough for us and [Music] um we see how the Lord takes over when we Minister it's not actually us ministering is God coming down to speak to his people there is a scripture in the Bible that says when the god when the when the tepanic was dedicated the crowd of Glory came down until the ministers failed to minister because of the presence of God I know each one of you have different needs and desires may God come down and prove that is the same yesterday today and forever I just learned it a few minutes ago from Florida because when I I was here I think it was yesterday but one or yesterday uh time difference is making a difference so I flew back to join my family and then I I'm flew in this morning as soon as I finish from the last cold place where I'll be in the at the airport to join my family again right we are doing missionary work at home and um about 20 of our churches have church stands and we believe we'll build even in trouble as times and make impact you know will be mortal once and I believe when you give to the Lord you'll never lose I will open from Hawkeye um chapter I'll open chapter two verse 15. says I pray you consider from this day upwards before the stone was laid a stone in the temple of the Lord I'll skip to verse 18. consider now from this day upwards from the 24th day of the ninth month even the day the foundation of the Lord's Temple was laid considered I'll escape to verse 20 and again the word of the Lord came to Akai in the 24th day of the month um I'll go to verse 23. in that day he said the Lord of hosts I will take self Propel my servant the son of shitail and say the Lord and I'll make him a sickness for I've chosen thee save the Lord of hosts let us pray our heavenly father we come to the service into our hands let the Holy Spirit come in a mighty way to send the needs of your people remove all their burdens as the Bible says the yorkship is destroyed because of the anointing that Holy Spirit father answer every unspoken need in unspoken desires father may he be that father will say from this day upwards something has happened in our lives that our Holy Ghost father so annoying to your people that all their burdens will be broken during the preaching of the word as the Bible says while Peter had Speck they were filled with holy spirit that everyone father never did the same father may all sicknesses be broken may you come and prove that you are the same yesterday to end forever and you specialize in things not impossible May that power of transformation come Lord father and attend to everyone who is who is saying enough is enough I'm sick and tired of this situation may the same Jesus come Lord father and prove that is a present help in time of need and when your people and fight their battles raise them to new platforming new Spears in that spiritual way they shall know you better Lord father in The Power of your Resurrection in Jesus name I pray amen right to represented I usually preach with my PowerPoint and my slides but I thought um when I was coming I thought maybe the airlines will keep changing the times you know when I was traveling back they kept changing the time so I thought I only have time to set up anything so my subject today is from the scripture there it says consider from this day upwards where we see in the Bible it happened that on the 24th day of the ninth month that's when God says he takes his seven sirupa Bell and it happens actually to be the day when God took our prophet but he says I will take the rubber bill in the last verse say he says I will take you and make a Signet a powerful Authority so it was a ninth month is December to Israel because April is the first month so the 24th day of the ninth month is 24 December to us because April is the first month you come from April in Israel so here he's saying I will take my servant then but he says consider from this day upwards so God takes his servant but he says consider from this day upwards in other words um in verse 20 there let's go to verse three okay he says who is left among you who has seen this house in a first glory and how do we see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison as nothing so looking at your life and your ought to be condition looking at your life and the promise of the hour looking at your life and the message is it not in comparison as nothing so your starting point it may look like you have not reached these fears and dimensions and channels spots where you want to live as a Christian but God who has the power to restore is saying the glory of the latter house shall exceed out of the former now he takes his servant then on the 24th day of the ninth month which is 24 December but now it says consider from that day apart this message is continuous this message is Unstoppable when God took Christ he says greater work shall you do because that which Christ was doing is continued after his taken when God took Moses he says I was with Moses so shall I be with Joshua so the message was Unstoppable because when he took Moses he did not take away the pillar of fire it did not take away the count of Glory so God is still here today doing the same he is the same yesterday today and forever meaning your life cannot be the same yesterday today and forever that same God can come out of the patches of the Bible to meet you today he can come out of this spoken word he can come out of the sermon he can come out of your dream of that inspiration he can come out of the anointing he can come out of the atmosphere to be a present help in your life it's not enough to carry the Bible without the god of the Bible it's not enough to have the spoken word without the god of the spoken word it's not enough to have the books and attempts without the god that books and attempts that same God must prove himself so that you know him in the power of his resurrection I've seen that God opened the eyes of the blind during preaching I've seen Lambs disappearing I've actually repair referred patience for my surgery to church some conditions that I failed to handle at the century we end with them at the altar in that same God I've seen him restore even marriages that were broken where brother and sister were were divorced for 20 years in their sweethearts today so he says the starting point it's in your eyes in comparison is nothing when you look at your life in broken pieces God is able to take broken pieces and make something beautiful and something very good in your life it says I will write this tale again so we should see a progress of the spoken word in our lives this message is not a museum to say 1963 this happened 1965 this happened but the same thing is happening today the same power of the message now the book of Acts did not end with amen or other books ends in the New Testament end with amen but the book of Acts ends as if to be continued the last amen will be the last testimony in the pride when the last one comes in and we give the amen recall so whatever happened in the book of Acts must be happening what the church here did Pentecost is the standard it's right so we must see the same power same Holy Spirit same testimonies same special Miracles same holiness so if in the book of Acts they would cast out Devils we cast out Devils if in the book of Acts they will live holy we live holy it's in the book of Acts that special Miracles we have special miracles in the book of Acts if they have Apostles and fivefold Ministry we have the fivefold ministry so the same is continuing the same God is in coming in power and continuing when Elijah was taken up consider from that day onwards the same power that was in Elijah was now in Elijah being a continuation of the Elijah Ministry he could not be a continuation of a miracle that he was not humble saving under he was pouring water in the hands of Elijah he served under that Ministry then he became a continuation so as soon as Elijah was taken the same power in that proportion was seen in Elijah actually the last miracle of Elijah is the first miracle of Elisha the opening of Jordan River so he started exactly where Elijah left so it became a continuation actually Hebrews 11 Saints and their testimonies the Bible says they without us are not perfect meaning that our testimony is in the quality of Miracles and walk with God must exceed that of Hebrews level if under the blood of bulls and goats they will say sun stand still and sun stands under the blood of bulls and goats they will shut the mouth of lions and the Bible says out of weakness they were made strong it means your testimony must be higher than that under the blood of Jesus Christ the anointing that operates in your life must be higher than that and I'm clear that that same Jesus is here to meet you if you have a situation in your life that looks impossible while we are preaching the word May the power of God touch you and answer you and bring Total Restoration of what the devil stall in your life let it come back again so Christ says great awake shall you do where he finished disciples continued from there when God finished the creation Adam continued from there naming the animals saying and when he says this is an elephant God said amen whatever he named that animal that's what the animal became that is the power that we have as a child of God that whatever you call your situation that's what it shall be if you say I'm Healed that's what it shall be if you say I'm free that's what it shall be if you say I shall come out of this your life will go the direction of your words when you speak you know what God is that's what we are in a measure if God is God we are amateur God if God is light we are light if God is the king he has made us Kings if God is a priest he has met us priests if God whatever he is we are a chip of the old block if he is the Messiah he has made us Messiah God has put something in in us that will meet the challenge of the hour and I know there are potentials loaded in your life I'm only coming with jumpers to jumpstart that power into manifestation so that you don't live in underprivileged life but know that you are born for such a time as this born to do exploits our ought to be condition is when we do it to do exploits to be a Powerhouse not a pest house a Christian is loaded with potentials and blessings that your situation is too low for you the devil must not know what is happening in your life you must only know the size of your shoe and he must only be under your feet that is his own position you must not know what is happening in your marriage in your finances but you must only know to be under your feet that is the position of a Believer with dominion and adoption when you are in your spiritual rank as a Believer God's agenda in our life is to restore us when he met men many in Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 yet Dominion offered the fowls of the air and over the beasts of the land and over the the fish of the sea that's why when our Prophet comes you will demonstrate that dominion over the flying things and say bees go back to your place you will come to the fish of the sea and say little fish I give you life you come to the Beast of the land they say bull go back to your place that's why in Revelation chapter 10 that Mighty Angel demonstrate that Dominion with Heavenly powers and he put his foot on the sea that is the power that you have to control atmospheres to rule and govern as a son and daughter of God it's not that we shall have that power in the Millennium right now we have it that right now we shall exercise it people believe that we shall have that power more in this quiz correct but if the devil has squeezed you now show that power you have already been squeezed financially prematurely you've been been squeezed in your health use the Deadpool manifestation to speak to your mountain and your Mountain shall hear you remember your situation here's your voice if the trip on his head your situation hears if the mountain had your situation hears if the sun had and the moon ahead your situation here today it's a speaking service everyone will speak to the amounted and you shall see the results of the power of God so the book of Moses it is written in the Books of Moses that Moses died and the Book of Moses continue a bit after the death of Moses in the book of Samuel is written that Samuel died in the books of Samuel continue after the death of Samia so this message after the prophet messenger is gone there is no way where he says he's no longer here the angel is still here God has empowered their people and he says if the people shall the pride shall know who she is you can only know who you are by knowing who he is now the pride knows who the prophet is they know more about what God can do but they don't know who they are you shall know as you are known in heaven it's a perfect picture in heaven is what God is coming to restore in your life when you look at the perfect picture and that picture in your life now is it not in your eyes in comparison as nothing when you look at who God has called you to be and what you are now but I know you have this testimony that you are not what you should be yet you are not what you used to be every day you're getting better and better and I believe we move in line with the quotations and scriptures of our time if in 1960s our Prophet says there is a power that is coming into the church and now it's coming in that God will show annoying people that they will speak the word into flash like lightning I believe now that power we are already needs because it can't be future forever if he says the church is moving into a sphere right now that it was going to shut the whole world that church shall not be forever moving into a sphere they should be in that sphere now if he says the church is moving is living a million miles below their privileges let's say he says that in the 50s and 60s by now we can't be a million miles otherwise we are not responding we can't be a million miles now if we have not reached there maybe we are in we have a mileage that we can cover this service to reach our privileges what I'm saying is that it shall not be future always one day you shall step into what you have believed one day you shall experience what you are born to be you are here for a purpose and there are not enough devils in hell to stop you from being what God saw you becoming and God will release the anointing to Aid you to reach those levels in those fears life was in prayer life was in consecration levels in living right until the death is a mere spectator in your life the Devi has no chance financially spiritual in all directions of your life you are prevailing against all forces of evil so there is a continuation the Bible says consider from this day upwards in Revelation chapter 5 John is whipping saying no man could open the book The Abstract title Deeds of redemption Johnny is crying because he knows he wants to reach a certain level he knows that when that book is opened his answers are coming now we've opened this book and I believe your answers are coming when the book was opened there was praise when the book of the of the word of God is open Let There Be praise in your life now when John was weeping he didn't know that the line is already prevailed when you are crying about your circumstances you don't know that God has already answered your answer is older than your problem before you were in that situation there was already a scripture somewhere there was already a quotation somewhere there was already the anointing somewhere there was already a power somewhere to take you out of that situation and the reason why you desire to come out of that situation is because there is a deep calling to a dip the reason why of that desire is because there is a power somewhere that can answer that desire so your answer is older than your problem when John was weeping it was already done because Angels speak prophetically when the angel says the Elder says the lion head already prevailed when the book was still closed when your situation is still looking impossible God is already prevailed I read in the Bible how Angels speak prophetically in Revelation chapter 14 the angel says Papillon is Fallen then chapter 18 chapter 17 we see Babylon is moving around actually becoming more mysterious mystery Papillon when the engine says Patron is falling it becomes even more mysterious when we say your sickness is gone and it becomes more mysterious it's just because the next chapter people be saying alas in one hour Babylon is falling Allah it was declared before and what we did shall materialize the blessing that we declare upon your life one day shall be your personal property your Victory spiritually we declare your victory in your marriage we declare your victory in your health we declare your victory in your dreams we declare your victory in your children we declare your Victory academically in your paperwork in your permits in your documents let God answer in every direction of your life [Applause] that is the code of the message when you are associated with this message your life becomes Supernatural and it's naturally Supernatural meaning the Miracles become a regular routine now John was weeping because there was a crisis in heaven the one who sorted the crisis in heaven can sort the crisis in your life when no pop or bishop or Pastor or any Angel could answer that one man was Worthy when people could not help you there is someone who can help you but look at this your answer is older than you your problem when John was weeping the answer was already there when that woman when women were going to anoint Christ we're crying that who shall roll this turn they didn't know that his turn is already rolled those who are going to a mouse were crying walking with their answer crying working with their solution crying when you are carrying the message in the Bible you are working with your answer complaining but when their eyes were opened what opened their eyes was a continuation of the words of Christ when Christ did what he did before he died breaking the bread their eyes opened and today if God does something that he did when he was working in Galilee when he was working in in Jeffersonville our Prophet actually says Christ was more successful in Jeffersonville because of the Greater Works let me say Christ seems to be also more successful in Colombia in in in in South Carolina because of the Greater Works where you can even impact life where even missing limbs shall be restored now if missing limbs can be restored what more limbs that are there that just need healing now if God remove the weight of your sins he can remove the lamp from your body if God paid the debt that you could not even attempt to pay you can pay other debts in your life if it takes a a mustard seed a very small seed like that to move a mountain you need a fraction of that to move your problem if it takes part a millionth of a second in a moment in the think of an eye to change your entire body it takes him less than that to remove cancer from your body I've seen I've yet many testimonies during preaching and I believe today something special happen in your life brother we must become what we came to be in this message we we believe and we know that we are the super race final voice one in a million but as one in a million things are not moving in your life it's final voice things are not moving in your life you are struggling as the final voice but what you believe what you decree about yourself must one day match the happenings that's why the Bible is saying consider from this day upwards there is an experience that can happen that can turn around the tables there is two things that God does with tables some of them he prepares them in the presence of the enemies but sometimes he turns the tables when things are not moving if you are statement spiritual financially they shall be movement consider from this day upwards Moses yet try this purpose without the anointing but when he met the burning bush consider from that day upwards the most it was running away from Pharaoh now yet the fire in him he went to meet what he was running away from when disciples were running away from Pharisees and they locked themselves in the upper room when the Holy Ghost came down consider from that day upwards they went out looking for the Pharisees and said you Pharisees with Wicked hands crucified they were not fearing anymore now because the fire in them was more than the fire outside when they were boiled in Drums of oil like John the oil in them was more than the oil outside when they put in Lion's Den like Daniel the lion in them was more than the lying outside when they put in the fire furnace like shutting me check the fire in the Moss more than the far outside when they face the Giants like David the Giant in them was more than the child outside Creator is he that is within you than the one in the world we have to become the message what silences critics is not when you you you bring arguments but when your life proves that Jesus is Alive when your testimony when you save the same results that they are they're arguing about they see that same testimony knew that's what silence is the critics when the god of the Bible comes so in Revelation chapter 5 when John the same spot where he was crying in a few seconds that same spot you as rejoicing he says everything on Earth help me say you honor and Glory the same place where you are crying you shall rejoice in that same oh brother that chapter five started with pain and sorrow and tears of pain and it ended with the tears of joy the same service there is a before and after what you wear before the service and what you are after the service our good specializes in things that impossible if you have any rivers that you think unprossable and any mountain that you cannot turn it through our God is here for those mountains I've seen God changing Track Addicts to become message addicts I'm an attic to myself I can't live without the word I always want to be a bit High you know a Higher Ground a higher plane that I found every day brother I want to just get a dose of the Holy Ghost the message is so powerful that you don't need this whole container just a lead of quotations you'll be high you'll be already shouting Victory you know a drunk man does not see problems he's a part of the problems when I'm drunk with the spirit I'm a part of the situation uh our God is the Practical God that God must be seen in our services every time must be seen in our marriages in our children it's not a talk that we are we are better than denominations it's something that must be seen it's the people who said these are Christians because they saw Christ in them it's the people who say the spirit of Elijah now rest on Elijah is the people in denominations who say surely these are the people it's not us saying we are the best we are something must speak for you that same God the devil is so cheap in your life that he has no access when you when you leave that life is so close to God the devil becomes a mere spectator the devil is so cheap that when he wants to attack you he asks for permission from God the devil is so cheap that he has no keys to his home the bottom of speed the Angeles keys to the bottle of spit the devil is so cheap that he knows his time is short he's so cheap that he walks like a roaring lion but he's not a lion he's a liar the team is so cheap that with a finger of God not a hand we cast out devils they tell me so cheap that when the weakest of creatures pray there is confusion in hell not when we are in the center for our prayers when we are start when we are busy creating God our Father already there is confusion in hell now brother to for you to be not tossed to and from to be unshaken even in shaking times you need that experience where you can say consider from this day upwards I believe when David finished the Mighty Men of David continued those men who came to David as vain man running away from debts when they gathered around David something entered them that made them start killing the alliance as David did that made them killed Giants as devoted when they gathered around Christ something entered them that made them cast out Devils as Christ did when you gather around the message something must enter you that makes you Supernatural life I don't believe in Supernatural life of a messenger a natural life of believers who follow him no we must say the same Jesus alive says would see Jesus I know some of you have seen the devil but have you seen Jesus in your life I've seen the devil in my children the death in my husband the devil in the pastor the devil hey if you have so much of the devil in you you will see him everywhere but if you have so much of Christ in you you will see Christ in your pastor Christ in your life Christ in you the hope of glory what the devil fears is a Believer who knows his position because your position is linked to your possession so the original pre-fall state of man is what we are being restored to in the threefold purpose of God to reveal himself to a preeminence in a body of Believers and to restore the kingdom meaning whatever the devil stole from you must be restored today and it must be Sevenfold you must be seven times healthier than before you were sick whatever the devil stole from your life we want to force him we are not in talking terms with the devil but we are in casting terms today we want to silence the devil in your life I know something can happen in your life that we can say from that time consider from this day upwards your body is not a temp of sicknesses you are a temple of the holy spirit so what you don't want in your body must live yes if we believe that our bodies shall be changed in a moment in the think of an eye let's see a change in our lives now let's see a change you know God can restore what has been stolen in your marriage when you say enough is enough God can bring a permanent solution I don't believe in dealing with the same issue over and over but I believe whosoever the sun sets free is free indeed there can't be a permanent solution to those evil dreams they can be a permanent solution to those evil desires they can be a permanent solution to those evil addictions there can be a permanent solution to all those battles when we take the blood of Jesus Christ and put a full stop to your situation and we draw a no-fly zone for the devil in your life when question was in Egypt but Egypt was not in God we are in lautisia is not in US there was a spirit a spiritual boundary between Goshen and Egypt there was no physical separation but frogs could see the boundaries they were trying to fly over this side they knew that they of this site cannot be touched by what is touching those of that side as the lockers were flying they all of a sudden met a spiritual boundary as problems are flying let them see a spirit God says I will make a difference between Israel and Egypt the difference between us and other people is the Holy Ghost take away the Holy Ghost you remain the same as other people the difference between us and other people is the grace of God that's why none of us should burst in any way all of us must be patient with those who are outside this pulpit is not a push pit to push people into a pit it's a Pulpit to pull people from the pit that is how God works his program he has given us a minister of reconciliation by the grace of God I've seen serious tumors one sister at the cancer of the of the cervix came on Sunday we prayed for her eight demons manifested and they went away with the cancer and my friend Dr ngwenya the guy was supposed to operate that system it happened in 2012 she still has healed as she was there is no hard feeling half Deliverance half Holy Ghost baptism when God does something in your life the devil cannot reverse it things must happen if God has done it before he can do it if God has healed you before he can heal you again if God has touched you before he can touch you again if God has used you before he can use you again if God has forgiven you before and anointed you before he can anoint you before again if God has opened the way for you he shall open away again if God is undertaken for you he can undertake for you again I want you to believe today our services are not normal services we cannot coexist with spirits and the sicknesses when God comes down something must vanish in your life I want to put every Spirit under my feet today every service is a shutdown and I believe things change overnight [Applause] choice that moved from that prison to the throne overnight one night he was in prison with a promise to come out you are in that situation with the promise hanging over you and we are activating the promise before you were in that situation there was a scripture written to take you out the Bible says when you pass through the waters I'll be with you when you pass through the fire Isaiah 15 43 that scripture was written before Jonah was in the waters when he entered the waters God says when you you are in the waters it was written before Jonah was born Maybe but it worked when he entered the waters because it says when you pass through the waters it was written before they were in the fire furnace and he says when you enter the fire I'll be with you so there is a scripture that was written before you were born oh the love of God is so great in if you read in Revelation chapter 5 there are more than 100 trillion angels in heaven shouting the places of God so if demons that fail are attacked probably it's about 50 trillion devils meaning even if the devil adds 200 million he has ended yes it is 0.2 of demons but look at this let's say if the Angels like return in Revelation chapter 500 trillion um and there are trillions of devils when Angels they say 50 trillion engines fell it's not the actual number it's just amazing mathematics God has no mathematics in this program so if a 50 trillion engines fell and God did not make a Plan of Redemption and within two people fail and God says we have to move now when trillions of angels fell would say good riddance I'm not going to die for this but when two people in the Garden of Eden Fell down from his glory God came down [Applause] town he has made you above angels Angelita pooped is more powerful than the angel in heaven that's why I'm saying Heaven Affairs can sort your home affairs it's higher than that all the Fifth Dimension things that happening in you in your life are lower because we are speaking from the seventh dimension and God is a god of restoration listen as I'm about to cross I think I fight for so minutes to close but I'm feeling like this is me feeling I'm feeling like they should be a special case today to be attended when God gives gifts to his people he knows how to answer the patterns of the people it says the end time message will meet the end time conditions we cannot preach about the God and dismiss people with their problems there must be a performance blessed is she that believeth for they shall be a performance remember brother the holy spirit that was in our prophet oh that was in Jesus Christ is not Class A Holy Spirit and you receive caspi God there's no classes of the anointing to say this is for prophets this is for a regular member the same Holy Cross it's in you today the same power to speak the word don't leave it to yourself when Cornelius saw a vision Visions are not for Prophets Cornelius was not yet baptized in the name of Jesus Christ when he saw a vision he he didn't even have the Holy Spirit when he's so efficient he just desired things of God if you are hungry and test for the things of God thing will magnetize God into your life When Auntie Jemima saw that dream and vision she didn't even have the seals and the Thunders yes because that same God who has given us a rich message of the seals standards in the abstract tits must break the seals of your life ensure the worst writers that are damaging things financial and spiritual in your life he must show the host writers that are Galloping in your spiritual life making you fail to pray that same God must reveal also the church edges of your life because some of you are in Ephesus you've lost your first love some of you I are in Smyrna you are persecuted you are poor but you are rich some of you are in pecamus you have been married with wealthy websites and pornographic sites and things thoroughly married some of you are in the dark edges of the attire things are that Financial that spiritually but God is the Morning Star [Music] some of you are in satis you have a name that you live but you are dead you have a name that you're a brother and a sister but you are dead some of you are in Philadelphia God says because you have little strength I will set before you an open door and I say may God open doors in your life that you have never entered before some of you are in love this year I like this because laodicea started as a nothing as the west of the edges there is not even a eulogy where gods in other edges is touched by praising them for the good but in laodicea he has nothing to praise them for so it was the worst Edge but as we speak today is the best because Christ canceled them sent his Spirit sent the message and there's never been a day like this day this is the best of all ages so out of weakness they were made strong you start as nothing but courteous attendance of taking no parties and making somebody's out of them God is attendance of taking broken pieces and making masterpieces out of them the broken pieces of your life if you give them to God now he is a master of restoration he knows how to restore my prayer today is that everything that the devil stole from your life shall come back in a mysterious way when Ezekiel went to the fall of tripods he found things so disjointed he found so many bones that way it was negative after negative one it was a valley two there were broken bones two maybe three they were so dusty maybe they were so cold it was negative after Negative they were so hopeless but when he spoke the word things started connecting yes I speak the word I say dry marriage is here at the word of the Lord dry youth hear the word of the Lord backslide has come back to God now maybe let me ask um youth let's turn to our feet because I want to finish very soon why I want to finish very soon I want to steal 10 minutes to assist somebody in prayer I believe in the power of the word of God I believe in the power of the spoken word there is power in the written word there is power in the spoken word there is power in the revealed word there is power in the manifested word and there's power in you as a written episode as much as this word was translated you shall be translated one of these days now this power in the first poem laying one of hands and so forth there's power in the Deadpool now we're going to pull it first and third until there's an answer I believe in laying on offense as the Bible says I believe in casting all Devils as the Bible says I know preaching cast out devil is true when Christ finished the sermon on the mountain there was still a leper I know many deficit gone he had to deal with that leper when the prophet is preached a three-hour sermon you say this is a stubborn case I have to deal with it but he has been preaching so whosoever escapes the sword of jail or whatever sword the other one escapes the other sword will destroy when the prophet descend a tumor in meter by first pull hence he cast It Out by Deadpool and said before the doctors touch my wife let the hand of God dissolve the tumor I've been all around the world ministering the word of God this one thing I can tell you God is not a respecter of persons and God does not fail his people today if you need the Holy Spirit you shall receive the Holy Spirit today if there is a sickness in your body that sickness will vanish that great physician is here the great emancipator the great section the great job big big job fact is here to answer you what men fail that's what God Specializes in what you have failed to do I want to say today even if you have tried to live a Christian Life and they have been failing consider from this day upwards something has to happen when party Robinson the Holy Cross is his temper disappeared when Esther went in to be with the King Herman's problem disappeared your problem must disappear today in the name of Jesus Christ healing is your Redemptive rights blessings are your Redemptive rights a Christian is not followed by deaths and poverty and worries and Misfortune and BPS but surely goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life you must be blessed Luke chapter 2 verse 52 the Child Jesus grew physically in stature that is physical in wisdom mentally in favor with man that is socially in favor with God that is spiritual May a blessing of God be 360 Degrees around you financially spiritually my children like this message because they've seen God we went to our farm one time with a dairy farm we went to a farm there and we saw a cow that was buried we prayed for it give twins now it's fair that I'm trying to tell my children do's and don'ts only but when you meet the supernatural the those who do themselves and the don'ts who don't themselves so when you meet that power of God which I invite every pet slider and everyone who has feeling emptiness in their lives May that power touch them today this moment as I call the musicians to take their positions we're all going to pray for a short time then I will ask only few people we have hardest patterns because I believe patterns are lifted Calvary if you have a situation and your problem gets so heavy and you think there's no way through he is the lion that prevailed it here's the mighty conqueror this word is not in word only but in power and demonstration we have more than seven Barren people that we prayed for that have children now is anything to add for the Lord father God can come out of the pages of the Bible there is no window shopping on the promise of God when you see something take it when you enter a shop you enter with your prayer with your shopping list but when you come out you come out with Goods when you enter the House of Prayer you enter with a prayer list but when you come out you come out with Goods it's going to materialize what you believe one day you shall step into it they were playing a song when I was preaching in a place called philippus I saw people living their crashes like that now what is strange is that I feel this [Music] let's all cross our eyes and each one pray for a short time in their own way then after that I'll lay hands on a few with different burdens just to show that he is here that power that will take us to the rapture will take away evil desires it will take away every imaginations it will take away evil dreams it will take away

Daniel moved from the Lion's Den to promotion overnight many people should move from lot deeper to the king's table overnight God can turn your situation that has been there for 10 years this moment I
