[40:01] Teenage life that was a junction of time
[40:04] there were changes made in life somebody
[40:06] says every seven years you come to
[40:09] Junctions and things change
[40:11] and they said that you know at 40 and 40
[40:14] is Judgment amen
[40:16] and uh the objections of time come
[40:20] but in our lives as we go through
[40:22] Junctions and different Crossroads comes
[40:25] in our lives decisions has to be made
[40:28] amen sometimes it comes to a junction of
[40:31] time
[40:33] when we want to you know go off to
[40:35] school and you graduate from high school
[40:38] when you come to a junction decisions
[40:40] that I make whether I go to trade
[40:42] whether I go to college and those
[40:44] objections of time
[40:46] those particular animals in life
[40:49] decisions have to be made
[40:52] amen
[40:53] sometimes we're faced with decisions
[40:55] that we don't want to make we want
[40:58] somebody to make our decisions for us
[41:01] but we come to a place where we have to
[41:04] make our own decision when it comes down
[41:06] to uh the junction when Christ called
[41:09] you to himself for salvation you have to
[41:12] make your own decision about it
[41:14] sometimes we'll we'll make decisions
[41:16] based on the family we'll make decisions
[41:19] based on friends we make decisions based
[41:22] on uh uh uh us a Grandmama or granddad
[41:25] but you got to make your decision for
[41:28] God on your own
[41:30] you got to know that God is speaking to
[41:32] your heart and God is calling you as an
[41:35] individual
[41:36] the Cambio church called and it's got to
[41:38] be an individual calling he said my
[41:41] sheep will hear my voice they know my
[41:43] voice amen when God is speaking to you
[41:46] amen can't no devil in hell amen stop
[41:50] you from coming
[41:52] are you a man if God said come then
[41:55] you're able to come no matter what the
[41:57] condition is amen you know that Jesus
[42:00] Christ died for your sin and that his
[42:03] blood was shedded for you
[42:05] and then no devil can hold you in sin if
[42:08] you want to receive amen what Jesus done
[42:11] for you amen
[42:12] so that Junction when you make that
[42:15] decision that was a junction in time
[42:17] there was a junction in your life that
[42:19] Jesus came into your life and changed
[42:22] your whole life
[42:23] amen everything changed
[42:26] the way you think changed the way you're
[42:28] walking the way your talk changed
[42:31] everything changed because that was a
[42:34] junction
[42:35] when Jesus saved me
[42:38] amen things change some folks amen they
[42:42] come to that Junction and they only come
[42:45] uh they make their minds up partially
[42:48] they let Jesus in partially amen it's
[42:52] not a total surrendering where there are
[42:54] major changes in life
[42:59] and I heard you know
[43:01] uh God's service talk about when when uh
[43:06] there are Junctions that come amen and
[43:10] in the days of Noah
[43:13] and when the days of Noah came he says
[43:16] uh the miraculous
[43:19] speaks of the omnipotent
[43:22] and when the omnipotent takes place
[43:25] amen Miracles uh vindicate the god the
[43:30] miraculous the Miracles take place
[43:32] defindicate that God I mean you'll come
[43:36] to that Junction
[43:38] it was a miracle that amen Noah was
[43:41] building an ark Amen on dry land
[43:45] people had never seen rain
[43:48] amen because it never rains but yet it
[43:52] was God speaking to Noah telling them to
[43:55] belong
[43:57] that's something when God speaks to your
[44:00] heart as an individual
[44:02] when God deals with you as an individual
[44:06] praise God Nobody Knows the inner voice
[44:10] nobody knows what amen when God Amen is
[44:13] able to speak to you amen maybe it's not
[44:17] an art of a voice but God began to deal
[44:19] with your ins and outs and what you
[44:22] going through in life
[44:24] and God began to talk to you and tell
[44:26] you it's time to make a change
[44:30] it's time you'll come to a junction it's
[44:33] time to give your heart to him it's time
[44:35] to give God your problems your situation
[44:38] your condition it's time to let God
[44:41] handle what you can't fix
[44:44] it it's time to let God fix things for
[44:47] you let's let God provide your every
[44:50] need
[44:51] it's time to let God take a while
[44:55] sometimes we have trouble on every side
[44:58] where we're not willing to let God
[45:00] happen our problems in our situations in
[45:03] our conditions we're not willing
[45:06] willing to do that but I've said if you
[45:09] allow him then God will back up his word
[45:13] with the miraculous
[45:16] amen praise God because you're listening
[45:18] to the omnipotent God the god that got
[45:22] all power
[45:23] to a god that can do exceedingly and
[45:27] abundantly above all that which we can
[45:30] actually think a God that can handle
[45:33] your problems a God that can stop amen
[45:37] every condition that you're facing
[45:39] if you let him Hound in
[45:43] in the days of Noah
[45:46] the people that want to believe that
[45:48] they have come to a time of a junction
[45:53] they heard no humble servant
[45:57] talking about rain but
[45:59] they didn't want to believe that
[46:02] I mean when you're speaking of an odd
[46:05] thing and it's not the common thing he
[46:09] was probably the only preacher was
[46:11] preaching what he was preaching
[46:14] amen that the world was getting ready to
[46:15] be destroyed in the world had come to an
[46:18] end
[46:19] he probably was the only one that had
[46:23] that voice that was speaking of such a
[46:25] thing
[46:26] and who would believe that report who
[46:29] would believe such a thing could happen
[46:31] all the scientific world and everything
[46:34] was the scientific world was beyond what
[46:37] we have now
[46:39] amen it probably you know you talk about
[46:42] the computer age and all of that the
[46:44] things that they did then with the
[46:46] pyramids and all they they haven't been
[46:49] able to match it yet
[46:51] are you up man
[46:52] so that age were was uh Beyond and
[46:56] looked like this age that we're living
[46:57] in
[46:58] yet they said it could not rain it
[47:01] wouldn't rain
[47:02] but Noah had an uncommon message
[47:05] speaking of something that was not
[47:08] really in that uh if it happened it
[47:12] happened it has to be a miracle
[47:15] there have to be something Supernatural
[47:17] you have to be something amen out of the
[47:20] ordinary
[47:22] brother and sister
[47:24] I believe because of your message you
[47:26] suffer

[47:31] your message
[47:33] are you a man
[47:35] the bible say that they that live Godly
[47:37] in Christ Jesus gonna suffer persecution
[47:40] but you find that we're living in a
[47:42] world where people don't want to suffer
[47:45] no more
[47:47] amen we don't want to go through it
[47:50] Jesus said If any man come after me let
[47:52] him deny himself take up his cross and
[47:55] follow me
[47:57] Amen brother when you come to that
[47:58] Junction
[47:59] they make the cross don't seem too hard

[1:14:34] you see what I'm saying

[1:15:15] for everything that he's done for you
[1:15:17] and everything he's doing for you you
[1:15:20] ought to give him praise every day
[1:15:23] oh
[1:15:26] this is that Junction and the Bible says
[1:15:29] that acted was in the days of Noah and
[1:15:31] as it was in the days of lot they were
[1:15:33] eating the drinking marriage giving in
[1:15:34] marriage and he said thus shall it be in
[1:15:37] the day when the son of man prophet of
[1:15:39] God said he said you know
[1:15:42] they had angels to come down
[1:15:45] at that Junction
[1:15:47] Moses had Angels the pillar of fire
[1:15:49] Supernatural intervention every Junction
[1:15:51] he said ages came down
[1:15:54] in that Junction of time
[1:15:57] and he came down among men
[1:16:00] remember the Three Angels came and
[1:16:02] talked to Abraham
[1:16:03] the silly high from Abraham the thing
[1:16:06] we're about to do it was the miraculous
[1:16:08] men came down ain't just came down as a
[1:16:12] men
[1:16:12] and they told them we're getting ready
[1:16:14] to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:16:16] isn't that right
[1:16:18] he said those angels
[1:16:20] and he was talking about how the age
[1:16:22] would come to him all the time and talk
[1:16:23] to him
[1:16:24] he said Angels Among the people right
[1:16:27] now
[1:16:28] they come as men
[1:16:30] and they talk to the people
[1:16:33] they're telling you of the what's
[1:16:35] getting ready to happen and things men
[1:16:39] amen
[1:16:41] these are supernatural angels that when
[1:16:43] they went down to Sodom the smart the
[1:16:45] people blind
[1:16:47] that were trying to get in the house
[1:16:48] tell me they didn't want the Virgin
[1:16:50] daughters but they wanted to go with the
[1:16:52] men
[1:16:53] isn't that right
[1:16:55] so what is happening now the devil is
[1:16:58] smiting people
[1:17:00] people are blind because they don't want
[1:17:03] God
[1:17:04] when you don't want God the devil will
[1:17:07] blind your mind
[1:17:09] are you with me
[1:17:11] and the devil is actually
[1:17:15] allowing people to become blind by
[1:17:17] rejecting the word of God
[1:17:20] I gotta go
[1:17:21] but it's a junction
[1:17:23] as those angels came down remember
[1:17:26] Elohim God the Lord stayed with Abraham
[1:17:31] they elect are you with me
[1:17:35] and I'm saying God would stay with delay
[1:17:38] there must be
[1:17:41] somebody here now staying with you
[1:17:45] if you're the elect
[1:17:49] why the worst rest of the world is being
[1:17:51] blind
[1:17:53] there's something keeping you from being
[1:17:55] blind
[1:17:58] he said shall I hide from Abraham the
[1:18:00] thing that I'm about to do the world
[1:18:04] is getting ready to be destroyed he said
[1:18:08] that he would come with flaming
[1:18:11] fire amen
[1:18:14] I'm gonna talk about
[1:18:16] as I closed today
[1:18:21] it's going to be a a bad thing to
[1:18:24] experience the wrath of God
[1:18:28] and to be left behind
[1:18:31] he says
[1:18:33] in the seventh verse and to you who are
[1:18:37] troubled he says what
[1:18:39] rest with us I'm closing when the Lord
[1:18:43] Jesus shall be what
[1:18:46] reveal from heaven with his wife
[1:18:49] Mighty angels I believe the angels of
[1:18:52] God
[1:18:54] it says UFOs and all of that
[1:18:58] the prophet God said those are angels
[1:19:01] coming
[1:19:03] like they came to Sodom and should I
[1:19:06] hide from Abraham the things
[1:19:10] he said I'm going to see whether to cry
[1:19:12] is all together what he said
[1:19:15] if the Angels came and visited
[1:19:18] South Carolina visit Columbia South
[1:19:21] Carolina what would they give go back to
[1:19:23] God and Report
[1:19:26] are you with me
[1:19:28] would he say God is all right they're
[1:19:30] destroyed
[1:19:32] South Carolina it's all right to destroy
[1:19:35] this world
[1:19:36] a way to go back and say Lord
[1:19:39] there's too many righteous there too
[1:19:41] many people trying to live for you
[1:19:43] it's bad
[1:19:45] how many would he find
[1:19:48] in the days of Noah he found Aid
[1:19:51] in Sodom he couldn't even get 10.
[1:19:55] Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities round
[1:19:57] about and couldn't find 10 and out of
[1:19:59] all those cities
[1:20:01] are you with me
[1:20:03] if he found 10 he would expired
[1:20:07] I wanted to find 10 in Colombia
[1:20:10] 10 this morning
[1:20:12] I know there are churches with two
[1:20:15] thousand five five hundred
[1:20:19] people are in the big crowds and they
[1:20:21] all said ain't ready we're ready for
[1:20:23] heaven
[1:20:25] but are they really ready
[1:20:27] brother and sister are you really ready
[1:20:31] he says
[1:20:33] Dave first says
[1:20:36] in flame of fire taken what
[1:20:40] vendors on them that know not God
[1:20:43] and that what
[1:20:48] who's the ninth verse who shall be what
[1:20:52] punished with what
[1:20:55] from the what
[1:20:59] let me tell you something
[1:21:02] it's something it's going to happen
[1:21:04] Everlasting destruction from the
[1:21:06] president and from the glory of his word
[1:21:09] power
[1:21:11] when he shall come to be what
[1:21:17] I'll tell you something
[1:21:18] he's going to come and
[1:21:20] to be glorified well
[1:21:25] and that's what I'm talking about
[1:21:27] you
[1:21:28] ought to let his glory come in you
[1:21:31] experience his glory
[1:21:33] instead of all this fussing in spirit
[1:21:36] let his glory come in
