[34:11] amen amen if you have your Bibles this
[34:13] morning you want to turn to the book of
[34:17] First
[34:22] Kings chapter 19
[34:54] might be a familiar scripture to some
[34:55] but
[35:02] let's start reading at the first verse
[35:05] and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah
[35:07] had done and with all how he had slain
[35:10] all the prophets with the sword then
[35:13] Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah
[35:15] saying so let the gods do to me and more
[35:19] also if I make not thy life as the life
[35:22] of one of those by tomorrow about this
[35:25] time and when he saw that arose and went
[35:29] for his life and came to BBA which
[35:31] belongeth to Judah and let his Serv and
[35:34] left his servant there but he himself
[35:37] went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness
[35:40] and came and sat down under a juniper
[35:42] tree and he requested for himself that
[35:45] he might die and he said it is enough
[35:48] now oh Lord take away my life for I am
[35:51] not better than my fathers as and as he
[35:54] lay and slept under juniper tree behold
[35:57] then an angel touched him and said unto
[35:59] him arise and eat and he looked and
[36:01] behold there was a cake making on the co
[36:06] and a cruise of water at his head and he
[36:09] did eat and drink and laid down again
[36:12] and the angel of the Lord came again the
[36:14] second time and touched him and said
[36:17] arise and eat because the journey is too
[36:20] great for thee and he arose and did eat
[36:22] and
[36:23] drink and went in the strength of that
[36:26] meat 40 days and 40 nights unto horb
[36:29] Mount of God and he came thither unto a
[36:33] cave and lodged there and behold the
[36:36] word of the Lord came unto him and said
[36:39] unto him what does thou hear Elijah amen
[36:43] God bless the reading of this word you
[36:44] might you may be
[36:47] seated amen I like to speak on a little
[36:50] topic that I in time I
[36:55] entitled it's time for a check
[36:58] it's time for a checkin and we see that
[37:01] Elijah had gotten to the point that he
[37:03] was discouraged he had gotten to the
[37:05] point that he was so low that he asked
[37:07] the Lord to take his life but I don't
[37:09] want to stay on that part I wanted to
[37:11] get to the point where in verse 9 he
[37:14] says what Dost thou hear Elijah and
[37:17] Elijah had gotten to a place that he was
[37:19] just sitting in in this one spot like he
[37:22] was hiding and God had to come and get
[37:25] him and said Elijah you have a purpose
[37:28] to do you have a plan that I have
[37:30] purpose for you to do so what Dost thou
[37:32] hear why are you sitting here it was
[37:34] time for Elijah to have a checkin with
[37:37] God it was time for him to have a
[37:39] checkin with God or a checkup with God
[37:42] where God had to come and he had to tell
[37:44] Elijah what are you doing here why are
[37:47] you sitting still in this cave hiding
[37:49] when I called you to go forth and to do
[37:51] what I told you to do see God has to
[37:54] sometimes we got to have check-ins with
[37:56] God we got to come to come to our senses
[37:59] and come to him and said Lord I I need a
[38:01] tune up I need a check up with you Lord
[38:04] I want you to examine my walk examine my
[38:06] life so that you can so that I may
[38:09] understand where I am and what I need to
[38:11] do cuz my whole goal is to make it and
[38:14] if I ain't going to make it then I need
[38:16] to figure out why I'm not going to make
[38:17] it see if it's something small or
[38:20] something great it's time for me to have
[38:22] a checkin with God see it's time for me
[38:25] to have a checkup with God so that he
[38:27] can tell me what's wrong amen and and he
[38:30] can tell me how to fix it and if I can't
[38:32] fix it I know the one that can fix it
[38:35] see I but first of all I got to have a
[38:37] moment where I can check in with God
[38:39] Amen
[38:41] yes I said back when I was working we
[38:44] had these things that we call checkins
[38:46] with our managers so like we had them
[38:49] what we scheduled them we had weekly
[38:51] checkins and it was basically a progress
[38:54] report what did you do this week and
[38:55] what do you plan to do next week and is
[38:57] there any way that they could help you
[39:00] well sometimes I I would think back to
[39:02] those times when I when I was there
[39:04] working on that job and and sometimes
[39:06] you didn't want to have your check
[39:08] in and people and people was like why
[39:11] won't you cuz sometimes you ain't do a
[39:12] whole lot that week so you was like I
[39:15] don't want to talk to you cuz I ain't
[39:16] got no reason to report to you to tell
[39:18] you what I did I have no reasons and
[39:21] sometimes we get with God cuz we be like
[39:23] I didn't do nothing for the Lord this
[39:25] week I don't want to have a check with
[39:27] God this week cuz I didn't do nothing
[39:29] you know I you know it was a struggle
[39:31] this week so I don't want to have this
[39:33] check in but that doesn't mean you
[39:35] shouldn't have the check in that doesn't
[39:37] mean that you should postpone the
[39:39] calendar invite on your calendar said
[39:41] let's move it to Monday because I'm
[39:43] going to try to do something on Friday
[39:45] when it's scheduled on Friday you
[39:47] sometimes we do that because we trying
[39:49] to and that's what you sometimes we do
[39:50] to God lord don't come near me this week
[39:53] um wait till next week I'll be better
[39:55] next week and then by the time you know
[39:58] it it's a week it's two weeks cuz
[40:00] sometime they cancel on Monday cuz they
[40:02] out of work on Monday so you say thank
[40:03] you
[40:04] Jesus and and that and that's how we do
[40:07] God sometimes we oh he too busy for me
[40:09] right now he didn't see it so we going
[40:11] to go on and we going to clean this up
[40:13] next week but when when does the
[40:15] check-in become too
[40:17] late when does the checkin become too
[40:20] late where where where it's like the
[40:22] next thing you know they laying you off
[40:23] your job because you done postponed
[40:25] postponed when you could have went ain't
[40:27] got help in the first place when you
[40:29] could have had that slight check in and
[40:31] corrected a small mistake versus having
[40:33] a big mistake down the
[40:35] road but sometimes we we in the process
[40:38] of
[40:39] delaying of delaying and say you know
[40:41] what I'm going to fix it in the future
[40:44] I'm going to fix it in the future but
[40:46] not all the time do you have a future to
[40:48] fix it in amen amen and sometimes you
[40:50] don't have a future to fix it in if the
[40:53] job crashed tomorrow then you got to go
[40:54] find another job you can't fix it no
[40:56] more at that job amen it's just a lesson
[40:59] learned and sometimes you got to
[41:01] understand that God be trying to work on
[41:03] you so you don't have to go through that
[41:05] lesson somewhere else you don't have to
[41:07] go through there and build and try to
[41:09] build a new Equity with someone else God
[41:12] has a way of making sure that you have
[41:14] those checkins and sometimes when you
[41:16] don't want to have a checkin God come
[41:18] knocking on your door to find you like
[41:22] he did Adam and Eve he said Adam Eve
[41:24] Where Art Thou it wasn't that God didn't
[41:27] know where where they were he wanted
[41:29] them to come have a checkin with them he
[41:31] knew what they had done he could all he
[41:33] knew all things but he wanted them to
[41:36] come have a checkin with him he wanted
[41:39] them to decide you know what it's time
[41:40] for us to go get right with God it's
[41:43] time for us to go do what he asked us to
[41:45] do it's time for us to come but God
[41:48] wants he gave us a choice he gave us a
[41:51] choice that we can look at it and say
[41:53] you know what I want to have my check-in
[41:55] with God Amen man and each and every day
[41:57] that you have breath in your body you
[41:59] can have a check in with God you can
[42:02] have you can say Lord check on me I was
[42:04] thinking about it and I thought about it
[42:07] when when they if you ever watched a a
[42:11] car race if you ever watched a NASCAR
[42:14] race and when they're racing many of
[42:16] times they have this thing that they
[42:18] call a pit stop and in the pit stop what
[42:21] is the pit stop for the pit stop is
[42:24] where you can go and tune up your car as
[42:26] quick as as possible so if you need new
[42:30] tires if you need more fuel if if you
[42:33] need these minor things they can do it
[42:36] and and they do it and they try to do it
[42:38] as quick as possible and I said
[42:40] sometimes we're running the race but we
[42:42] never making no pit stops and we
[42:45] wondering why the car breaking down we
[42:48] wondering why the car ain't running as
[42:50] smooth as it used to we wondering why
[42:52] hey the fuel tank getting low but we not
[42:55] we don't want to have a pit stop
[42:57] we don't want to pause for a second and
[43:00] take time and go there and get tuned up
[43:02] we don't want to stop what we doing to
[43:05] to to allow God to work on us mold us
[43:08] and make us and build us so that we can
[43:10] go around this track faster we don't
[43:13] want to have those moments because those
[43:15] are hard moments those are not moments
[43:17] that are easy for us those are moments
[43:19] that take time out of our regular
[43:21] scheduled plan of what we have going on
[43:23] in our
[43:25] lives see but God wants you to say you
[43:28] know what sometimes you got to take this
[43:29] moment to pause amen because if you
[43:32] don't take this moment to pause the
[43:33] wheels going to fall off and you going
[43:36] to be in the middle of a race with
[43:37] things zooming all around you and your
[43:39] wheels fall off and now you are a hazard
[43:42] on the track amen you are Hazard on the
[43:45] track because you don't want to take a
[43:47] time to pause and say Lord tune Me Up
[43:50] Lord I want to have my check in with you
[43:52] Lord I need a check up in my life Lord I
[43:55] need to examine my walk can see where I
[43:58] am the prophet of God said he said If
[44:01] any man can watch your own life and and
[44:05] any man can watch your own life and
[44:07] about tell what you are if you just
[44:11] check up on yourself whether you're
[44:13] really a Christian or not watch the
[44:16] things you do watch what you say and
[44:19] your Associates and so forth and you'll
[44:22] find out whether you really got anything
[44:24] or not see sometimes that's why some
[44:28] people are afraid to have a checkup with
[44:30] God cuz they don't want to see
[44:33] themselves in the in in the mirror they
[44:35] don't want God to put the mirror in
[44:37] front of them and show them exactly who
[44:38] they are and show them exactly what you
[44:41] are and and sometimes when when you have
[44:44] those moments you realize you can do
[44:46] like David and go down on your knees and
[44:48] say Lord forgive me amen Lord forgive me
[44:52] because sometime you can may think that
[44:54] you going along and you just coasting
[44:56] and the Lord trying to tell you your
[44:57] wheels about to fall off he trying to
[45:00] tell you that you're about to run out of
[45:01] fuel he trying to tell you that you know
[45:04] what if you don't go into this pit stop
[45:06] now is you might not make this last
[45:09] laugh see sometimes you got to take that
[45:11] pause and say Lord I want to have a
[45:13] checkin with you I want to have a
[45:16] check-in with you Lord I want your
[45:18] presence with me Lord I want you to come
[45:21] near me and show me who I am cuz then
[45:24] when you show me then I can work on me I
[45:26] can do the things that I need to do the
[45:28] Lord to make sure that I'm ready for
[45:30] whatever is coming on the last lap Lord
[45:32] that I'm ready for whatever is going to
[45:34] be fall me on this last lap see some
[45:37] people don't want to have it but I said
[45:39] Lord it it they can keep running but I
[45:42] don't want to stop amen I want to take
[45:44] this pause now so that I can run I can
[45:46] run this last lap as fast as I need to
[45:50] yes Lord say you never know how how
[45:53] quickly the last lap is amen but if if
[45:57] you don't get a tune up you may never
[45:58] make the last
[46:00] lap see th those pit stops are important
[46:04] to make sure the car can continue to run
[46:06] continue to run continue to run that
[46:08] don't mean the car don't have Nicks and
[46:10] bruises on it that don't mean the car
[46:13] ain't got too close to the wall and and
[46:15] got a couple scrapes and scratches on it
[46:18] sometimes the car barely make it to the
[46:20] pit
[46:21] stop sometime they barely make it into
[46:24] the pit stop and and when they make it
[46:27] in but when they get done it's like a
[46:28] new car on the road and sometimes you
[46:31] got to ask Lord Lord I need your
[46:33] strength to make this last lap Lord I
[46:36] need you your your overcoming power to
[46:39] make this last lap Lord I need you to do
[46:42] something in my life to remind me and to
[46:44] show me that you're still here and that
[46:46] you're still with me and that you'll be
[46:49] with me until the end like you said you
[46:51] would Lord I got to come to the moment
[46:53] to hold you to your promises to make
[46:56] sure that even when it get dark outside
[46:58] and it get dark in the room with me Lord
[47:00] I know that you're still here even
[47:03] though I may not can see or feel you I
[47:05] know that you're still here cuz Lord you
[47:07] promised that you'll never leave me and
[47:09] you'll never forsake me and you'll be
[47:11] there to the end but see you won't get
[47:13] that until you have your check in amen
[47:16] see you got to take those moments and
[47:18] pause and say Lord I need you to
[47:20] continue to do a work Lord I need you to
[47:23] continue to do a work in my life Lord I
[47:25] need to get along with you so that I
[47:27] know that Lord what you want me to do
[47:30] there was something God wanted Elijah to
[47:32] do that's why he came and said Elijah
[47:35] why sest thou
[47:36] here he said what does TH hear Elijah
[47:40] cuz he had something that he wanted
[47:42] wanted us to do I was talking to a
[47:44] friend about this and they was like and
[47:46] they ma made a great analogy and they
[47:48] said sometimes it's like when you when
[47:50] you're graduating and you're going from
[47:53] high school to college you know some
[47:55] people want to stay in high school
[47:57] with all they
[47:59] friends with all their Associates and
[48:02] where it's
[48:03] easy sometimes we get to places in life
[48:06] where we just decide you know what I'm
[48:08] okay here I'm okay I can settle here
[48:11] this this is good for me you know the
[48:14] Lord the Lord has done enough for me in
[48:16] my life I'm good right here and we get
[48:19] afraid to take the next step cuz we
[48:21] don't know what that might be it might
[48:22] be harder on the next step you might not
[48:25] know what to do on the next step there's
[48:27] less guidance on the next step cuz when
[48:30] when you in middle school from K12 to to
[48:34] about high school you know that you're
[48:36] going on if you pass your classes and go
[48:38] to you're going to the next grade you're
[48:41] going to the next grade all you got to
[48:42] do is sure do your work and it's
[48:44] pre-planned the school bus come you get
[48:46] on the bus you go to school or some or
[48:49] you drive to school once you get old
[48:50] enough to drive to school but you know
[48:52] where you going it's the same place
[48:54] every day and you're going to see these
[48:56] teachers and you got your school friends
[48:58] that you might have been friends with
[48:59] for a long time and they right there
[49:01] with
[49:02] you but when you go off the college is
[49:06] different cuz what's familiar is
[49:09] gone what's familiar is no longer there
[49:12] that safety net that was there around
[49:15] you is no longer there and now you got
[49:18] to make your own decisions now you got
[49:21] to make some of your own choices not all
[49:23] of them but you get to make your own
[49:25] choices some time you get to make of
[49:27] what I want to eat even though you might
[49:29] get a meal plan some people or you might
[49:31] eat at home depending on what you do but
[49:33] you get to decide what you want to do
[49:36] sometimes you get to decide what you
[49:37] want to major
[49:38] in what school you want to go to
[49:41] sometime that's a choice sometimes
[49:43] that's a choice what school you want to
[49:44] go to what you want to major in what
[49:46] classes you want to take when you want
[49:48] to take them and ain't nobody unless
[49:50] you're getting guidance going to tell
[49:51] you what you what what you going to do
[49:54] it's up to you and see God puts us in
[49:57] situations sometimes that allow us to
[50:00] make choices like that decide what we
[50:03] want to do but he already has it all in
[50:06] the plan and he knows what you going to
[50:08] do before you do it but he allows you to
[50:10] make you think that you making a choice
[50:14] but many of times our choices are
[50:16] influenced about who we
[50:17] around it's influenced about what our
[50:20] friends are doing sometimes is
[50:22] influenced about okay um let's see this
[50:25] was easy for me so therefore I think
[50:27] it's going to be easy for me on the next
[50:29] level that ain't always necessarily true
[50:33] amen just cuz you think it's easy and
[50:35] this but when you go to that next level
[50:38] woo Lord Jesus it can be a whole lot
[50:40] harder I know from experience and so and
[50:44] sometimes you have to go to God and say
[50:46] Lord what would you have me to do amen
[50:49] yes and when God speak to you and give
[50:52] you that Revelation for yourself it's
[50:54] like standing on a solid rock amen
[50:57] because no matter how hard you struggle
[50:59] no matter how much you may almost fail
[51:02] and maybe sometimes fa you know that's
[51:04] what you supposed to do you know that's
[51:06] what you're supposed to do and no matter
[51:08] how many people discourage you and talk
[51:10] down to you it don't matter who it is
[51:12] family friends and others you you stand
[51:15] on it because that's what the Lord told
[51:17] you to do amen and see that's what
[51:20] sometimes God want you to stand alone by
[51:22] yourself so that you can get a word from
[51:25] him so that you know what you supposed
[51:26] to do he wants you to take that pit stop
[51:29] so that he going to tell you Hey listen
[51:31] don't go to the the inside of the track
[51:33] ride on the outside and you may say
[51:36] that's the longest way to get there to
[51:38] the Finish Line riding on the outside
[51:40] that's the but he he didn't tell you
[51:41] that there was going to be a crash on
[51:43] the inside he didn't tell you that there
[51:45] was going to be a couple people that's
[51:47] going to be fighting back and forth and
[51:49] weaving in and out on the inside he
[51:51] didn't tell you all that he just said
[51:52] ride on the outside and you wondering
[51:55] why you riding out there take the
[51:56] longest way to get to the finish line
[51:59] but there was a reason there was a
[52:02] reason but you would have never known if
[52:04] you didn't take the pit stop and said
[52:05] Lord I want you to show me what I'm
[52:07] supposed to do amen Lord I want you to
[52:10] show me how I'm supposed to act Lord I
[52:13] want you to show me how I'm supposed to
[52:15] respond see but it's taking that pit
[52:18] stop where God to show you exactly what
[52:20] you supposed to do he might not tell you
[52:22] all the steps and what how you supposed
[52:24] to do it but he might not tell you
[52:25] what's ahead but he give you leadership
[52:27] and Direction but it takes a time for
[52:30] you to pause and say it's time for me to
[52:32] have a checkup with God Amen it's time
[52:34] for him to show me Hey listen my wheels
[52:37] about to fall off I need him to replace
[52:38] the wheels Lord I need you to replace
[52:41] the fuel in the tank cuz Lord sometimes
[52:44] it's getting kind of low sometimes it's
[52:46] getting kind of
[52:48] discouraging sometimes the battles are
[52:50] getting harder the battles are getting
[52:52] tougher but Lord I need you to refuel
[52:54] the tank give give me some more Joy Lord
[52:57] give me some more happiness Lord give me
[52:59] some more Praises Lord let let let me
[53:02] enjoy you more Lord Lord let me let me
[53:04] get down and say Lord I Thank you more
[53:06] and let me get down and say Lord I lift
[53:08] my hands to give you more glory to give
[53:11] you more praise J see you got to go to
[53:14] him and say Lord I need you to refuel
[53:15] the tank amen cuz sometimes the tank
[53:18] ain't getting fueled while you while you
[53:20] going through life you got to go to them
[53:21] and take a pause Lord I need a special
[53:24] feeling Lord I don't need just to I need
[53:27] a special I need some special fuel for
[53:29] this for these trials and tribulations
[53:32] Lord I need a special v v Vindication
[53:35] from you amen yes yes Lord see that's
[53:39] what you got to go to cuz it's going to
[53:41] take more than what you what you had
[53:43] before sometime they put Nitro in the
[53:46] fuel and boy your your tank justoo it
[53:48] just take off it's it's something
[53:50] special in that fuel and when you flip
[53:53] that switch you you didn't realize how
[53:55] fast the car could go
[53:57] you didn't even realize that this car
[53:59] had this capability but when they put
[54:01] the put that fuel in there oh my God the
[54:04] car run to a whole new level and
[54:07] sometimes you got to ask God lord I need
[54:09] my car to run on a whole new level amen
[54:12] Lord I need you to elevate the car that
[54:14] I'm driving so that you know what I I
[54:16] can finish this race Lord Lord like this
[54:19] this ain't a regular race this a this a
[54:21] different type of race cuz all the
[54:23] devils in Hell done got loose on on the
[54:27] this a different typee of race that I
[54:28] got to run but when I run this race I
[54:30] know where the finish line going to
[54:33] be see I know what the finish line is
[54:36] that's why I can't give up on the race
[54:38] that's why I can't lay down the race
[54:40] some may lay ass to the side and you say
[54:42] no I'm a I'm going to quit the race some
[54:45] might decide to quit but I can't quit
[54:47] the race cuz I'm looking forward to the
[54:49] Finish Line I'm looking forward to where
[54:52] God is going to place me when I get to
[54:53] that Finish Line it don't matter how the
[54:56] race has been run before but Lord as I
[54:58] run this lab of this race as I ended
[55:01] this year and going to next year Lord I
[55:03] want to run faster than I did last year
[55:06] and whatever was befalling in this year
[55:08] I'm not taking to next year amen see
[55:10] that's the that's the type of pit stop
[55:12] that I want to have amen yes every some
[55:15] people just going in there and say and
[55:17] they telling God what they want they
[55:19] come to the pit stop and say all I need
[55:20] is
[55:22] fuel but it's not to your it's not your
[55:25] decision see see when you come to the
[55:27] pit stop there's a Pit Boss that's up
[55:29] there and telling exactly what they want
[55:31] under the
[55:32] car there's a Pit Boss is that has the
[55:36] complete control when you come to the
[55:37] pit
[55:38] stop and is guiding you around the track
[55:41] see sometimes you we go to God and say
[55:44] Lord this is what I want this this this
[55:46] this we don't go to him like Jesus got
[55:49] to his time for his checkin In The
[55:51] Garden of Gethsemane and when he had
[55:53] that check-in with God he said not my
[55:55] will but thy will be done amen yes when
[55:59] you have one of those checkins it can
[56:01] change the complexity of your entire
[56:03] decisions in life amen because you come
[56:07] to the moment that you say Lord I don't
[56:09] want what I want I want what you want
[56:11] for me amen and don't realize that if if
[56:15] you do what what he wants for you you
[56:17] get exceedingly abundantly more than you
[56:20] ever thought or imagine was possible for
[56:22] you amen you'll get more than you ever
[56:25] thought just by saying Lord I want your
[56:28] will to be done didn't mean it's going
[56:30] to be easy but it's just mean that he
[56:32] going to be there in the moments when
[56:34] it's not easy it doesn't mean that it's
[56:36] going it's going to be something that
[56:38] you going to lolly gag on
[56:40] through it's going to be something that
[56:43] that God will take you through things so
[56:44] he can mold you and make you into what
[56:46] he wants you to be am that's why he
[56:49] takes you through things so that you can
[56:50] say cuz all he wanted to do was be a
[56:53] savior amen so he had to take somebody
[56:55] and say Hey listen I need to be saved
[56:58] amen and he takes you through things
[57:00] that he wanted to be a Healer so he
[57:02] allows people to get
[57:04] sick just so you can go to him and say
[57:07] if I have faith to believe that by his
[57:09] stripes SE I'm Healed I'm healed amen
[57:12] and and it doesn't matter whether it
[57:14] happens today or happens tomorrow it's
[57:16] going to happen because I believe and
[57:19] even if it don't happen like the like
[57:21] the Hebrew boy said we still believe
[57:23] that he's still the same God if he don't
[57:25] deliver us from we not careful with what
[57:28] we're saying if he don't Deliver Us from
[57:30] the fiery furnace that don't mean he not
[57:33] God that just mean that that was the
[57:35] that was his plan for us that's where he
[57:37] wanted us to go and that's how he wanted
[57:39] to end it for us amen yes amen see
[57:42] that's what it is you get to that point
[57:44] that you said Lord thy will be done and
[57:46] that's it
[57:48] amen and and and I like to tell people I
[57:51] said that's a scary prayer to pray cuz
[57:54] you have no outcome
[57:56] you have no there there's nothing on the
[57:58] end of that prayer there's nothing to
[58:00] say hey do it this way there's nothing
[58:03] to say hey I wanted to come this
[58:05] way because God's will is totally
[58:08] different from how we would ever think
[58:10] amen when God has his will is totally
[58:13] different than how we think cuz God is
[58:16] say you know what instead of going
[58:18] straight I'm going to take you around
[58:20] the corner and around here and go this
[58:22] way and around that curve that you can't
[58:25] see what's around that curve and allow
[58:27] you to get to where exactly where you
[58:29] thought you could see down the
[58:31] road but he didn't tell you that there
[58:33] was a sink hole in the middle of that
[58:34] road if you had keep going straight that
[58:37] nobody could see it was just
[58:40] discovered but see that's how God does a
[58:42] thing because he knows exactly what's
[58:44] coming ahead he knows exactly what's on
[58:47] the road in the pathway and if you keep
[58:49] going then you might fall in that hole
[58:52] and nobody ever know because because
[58:55] that by that time they don't put up the
[58:57] detour sign they go around see God has a
[59:01] way of just leading you into what he
[59:03] wants you to do he leads you into how he
[59:05] wants you to live he leads you and he
[59:08] put a great God book in front of you
[59:10] that if you read it he'll tell you
[59:11] exactly what he wants you to do and
[59:13] he'll lead you so that in such a way
[59:16] that you'll say Lord I know it's nothing
[59:19] but you amen yes when it gets done and
[59:22] you look back you say I know that was
[59:24] nothing but the Lord amen when you look
[59:26] back and you say this ain't how I
[59:28] thought it was going to happen but you
[59:30] know what God thank you Lord because it
[59:33] was better than I thought it would be
[59:36] when he got done it was like it was more
[59:38] miraculous than I thought it would be
[59:40] see when he leads and guides you and you
[59:42] have that check in with him he'll take
[59:44] you to and allow and show you things
[59:47] that you may have never seen before that
[59:50] you may have never experienced before
[59:51] that you can turn around and to my
[59:53] friends and they can say hey that was
[59:55] God they Marvel at what happens to you
[59:58] they Marvel at what goes on for you and
[1:00:01] they just said that person just
[1:00:05] blessed and they Marvel at how God
[1:00:07] blessed you no it's because you turn and
[1:00:10] you put your faith and trust in him and
[1:00:12] you say Lord I want you to do the work
[1:00:14] not me do the work and when you turn and
[1:00:17] you put your trust in him God will do
[1:00:19] things that you didn't think was
[1:00:21] possible God can do the things that you
[1:00:24] thought were were just some sideline no
[1:00:26] those were the main things that God
[1:00:28] wanted done and say Lord I don't want to
[1:00:31] this one to put me here or that one to
[1:00:33] put me there but I Lord I want to do
[1:00:35] exactly what you purpos for me to do and
[1:00:38] Lord I don't want to be afraid to do
[1:00:40] what you asked me to do Am Lord so you
[1:00:42] got to be like Paul Lord I want I I want
[1:00:44] to be bold for you like Peter Lord I I
[1:00:47] want to do exactly what you call me to
[1:00:49] be see in that pit stop you'll have
[1:00:52] those conversations with God Amen and
[1:00:55] when you have have your check in and
[1:00:57] your your check up with God you examine
[1:01:00] yourself because the whole goal is is is
[1:01:03] to get better and to get stronger each
[1:01:05] and every time that you that you go to
[1:01:07] God and every time you come in the door
[1:01:09] you should leave different than the way
[1:01:11] that you came in
[1:01:14] amen cuz you never know how many more
[1:01:16] times did you get to come in the door
[1:01:19] and see God has a way of of allowing us
[1:01:21] to say you know what I'm coming to you
[1:01:23] today I'm coming to you today I want I
[1:01:26] want you to to get something and and and
[1:01:28] so it seeps down in the deep inside of
[1:01:31] you that even if you can't come in the
[1:01:32] door you can still talk to me that you
[1:01:35] can still reach me but it's according to
[1:01:37] your relationship with him and see
[1:01:39] that's what God wants you he wants you
[1:01:41] to have a check in with
[1:01:43] him he wants you to have a check up with
[1:01:46] him so that he can come to you and so
[1:01:48] that you can come to him and said Lord I
[1:01:50] want you to do what you want to do in my
[1:01:52] life yes Jes Lord
[1:01:56] Lord I I I wrote down something that I
[1:01:59] was going to um speak on it sometime but
[1:02:02] I I wrote it down and I said running
[1:02:04] from your
[1:02:06] responsibilities so many of times you
[1:02:08] can get into places where you run from
[1:02:09] your
[1:02:11] responsibilities well you you decide
[1:02:13] that I don't want to do this no more so
[1:02:14] you go somewhere else I don't want to do
[1:02:17] and it can be anything it could be
[1:02:19] something small so so someone ask you to
[1:02:22] take out the trash you go to ask
[1:02:23] somebody else to do it it's something
[1:02:26] really simple but God has a way that he
[1:02:28] got something that he wants you to do
[1:02:30] and as long as you running from it God
[1:02:33] allow you to go through things until you
[1:02:35] do exactly what he wants you to do and
[1:02:38] see God has a way if you have your check
[1:02:40] in you can avoid all that in between
[1:02:43] stuff going in the the belly of the well
[1:02:45] like Jonah did you can avoid all that by
[1:02:48] just having to check in with God and say
[1:02:49] Yes Lord and just go ahead and do it see
[1:02:53] that's what God wants to show you and he
[1:02:54] wants to do for your life this morning
[1:02:58] [Applause]
[1:03:08] amen praise God amen amen thank the Lord
[1:03:13] amen I appreciate the
[1:03:16] Lord I was thinking about the young man
[1:03:21] I
[1:03:22] was ask me to come and pray for a young
[1:03:24] man he's senior high
[1:03:27] school and
[1:03:30] uh they gave him up the doctor gave him
[1:03:34] up and I just went down to murle beach
[1:03:38] the another
[1:03:40] day to pray with him talk with him
[1:03:45] concerning his
[1:03:48] soul and as I was talking to Young
[1:03:51] nurses came in the room and they was
[1:03:55] standing inside that they came to do
[1:03:58] something for
[1:04:00] him and uh and I looked at them and say
[1:04:05] excuse me can I you
[1:04:09] know you you need me to stop they said
[1:04:12] no no you go ahead home and I was
[1:04:16] telling the young man
[1:04:19] about you know his soul and ask him way
[1:04:22] he stood with God
[1:04:26] to see a young man that's a senior in
[1:04:28] high
[1:04:30] school it says
[1:04:32] he's taking special classes so he was
[1:04:36] very intelligent young
[1:04:39] man but lying there with the tra in
[1:04:44] and I
[1:04:47] says I'm going to talk to you and tell
[1:04:50] you so do you know the Lord do you are
[1:04:53] you saved
[1:04:55] shook his hand and yeah I've accepted
[1:04:59] the Lord he couldn't talk that well
[1:05:02] because of the tra being the end he just
[1:05:06] says you've accepted
[1:05:09] Jesus I say he said yeah
[1:05:13] yes
[1:05:15] yes I
[1:05:17] say I'm going to ask you I'mma go
[1:05:21] through the scriptures
[1:05:23] anyway and I want you to
[1:05:26] I went through the scriptures concerning
[1:05:28] confessing with the mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:05:30] and believing in your heart that God
[1:05:32] raised him from the dead and thou shall
[1:05:33] be
[1:05:35] saved and the young man looked and he I
[1:05:38] said I want
[1:05:40] you just with all of your heart I want
[1:05:43] to make this I want to make this thing
[1:05:47] sure what's going on with you I want to
[1:05:49] make it
[1:05:50] sure I want to make sure because you
[1:05:53] know you done as say
[1:05:56] God Is A Healer and he's a miracle
[1:05:59] worker but I said the most important
[1:06:03] thing is your
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:06] soul I said God has a place prepared for
[1:06:10] them who
[1:06:12] believe and he loves
[1:06:14] you and he died for
[1:06:18] you this life healing is just for a
[1:06:22] moment just for a little
[1:06:24] while but your soul can spend
[1:06:30] eternity I said eternal life means more
[1:06:33] than healing right
[1:06:37] now yes God is a miracle worker God Is A
[1:06:40] Healer but eternal life means more so as
[1:06:44] I was talking to the young man and the
[1:06:47] two young
[1:06:49] ladies I looked at them again they said
[1:06:51] go ahead go ahead
[1:06:55] and uh we began to talk to him
[1:06:59] about after talking to him concerning
[1:07:02] his soul and confessing the Lord and
[1:07:04] making sure that that's
[1:07:06] right I start telling him testimonies
[1:07:11] of how God healed others I don't think
[1:07:15] he knew the gravity of his situation he
[1:07:18] didn't know how I don't think nobody
[1:07:20] told him I don't know whether anybody
[1:07:22] told him that he don't have long to
[1:07:26] live that whatever is wrong with is
[1:07:31] incurable it'll take God and God
[1:07:34] Alone to
[1:07:37] Healing other than that the doctors is
[1:07:40] all gave up they bought him from
[1:07:44] chareston and bought him closer to
[1:07:46] home cuz everybody's giving
[1:07:53] up and I says well I need to
[1:07:56] go and so I went
[1:08:00] in and this young man what got me I
[1:08:04] say after talking to him a while getting
[1:08:08] ready to pray I said tell me
[1:08:11] something what do you
[1:08:14] want what do you
[1:08:19] want I I
[1:08:21] say he said I
[1:08:23] want he couldn't talk
[1:08:26] I mean I could understand what he
[1:08:28] said I said he said I want to be
[1:08:33] healed I want to be
[1:08:41] healed laying there in that
[1:08:46] situation I said I'm going believe God
[1:08:50] and y'all believe God if you think about
[1:08:51] what I'm telling you
[1:08:56] his name is
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:09:00] Crawford I can tell you his first name
[1:09:06] Zia think about it
[1:09:09] maybe God would hear one of y'all
[1:09:13] prayer think about it
[1:09:16] because my heart was broken my you know
[1:09:20] I just didn't you don't want to see that
[1:09:27] but I want you to think about your
[1:09:30] life what if it was your
[1:09:36] life is God
[1:09:40] unfair do we
[1:09:42] deserve more than we
[1:09:46] have how do we treat what are we doing
[1:09:49] with this
[1:09:50] life so at the end of my conversation I
[1:09:52] says if God would heal you young man
[1:09:56] if God will heal
[1:09:59] you would you live for him would you
[1:10:03] give your
[1:10:04] life as a witness and a testimony to the
[1:10:08] Lord Jesus Christ he shook his head and
[1:10:11] he say yes I will live for
[1:10:15] him and I'll give my
[1:10:18] life as a
[1:10:20] testimony you see yes that's what I want
[1:10:26] you
[1:10:27] know I've seen a lot of
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:31] Miracles but I always try to stress the
[1:10:35] greatest
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:37] Miracle is that our
[1:10:39] soul is
[1:10:43] Sav because this life here
[1:10:47] is it's only here for a
[1:10:50] moment went to murder beach and B and
[1:10:53] then yes
[1:10:57] yesterday
[1:10:58] uh I went to Florence and by the funeral
[1:11:02] home to with Tanya Grace
[1:11:06] there she told
[1:11:09] me called me and told me she had many
[1:11:12] operations I guess God done raised her
[1:11:14] up and worked so many miracles in her
[1:11:18] life this time is sound a little
[1:11:22] different I've heard
[1:11:26] Supernatural things are happening in her
[1:11:28] life so many times she
[1:11:30] says brother
[1:11:34] Simmons I'm having this operation is
[1:11:37] very serious she had a lot of serious
[1:11:41] operations she says brother
[1:11:45] Simmons
[1:11:50] if they saying that it's a great
[1:11:53] possibility that I might not make
[1:11:57] it she said but I want you to know one
[1:12:00] thing I'm going to take the
[1:12:03] operation if I don't make
[1:12:06] it I'm all
[1:12:10] right she made it out operation made it
[1:12:13] back to rehab and
[1:12:16] everything and the other
[1:12:19] day brother Nathan called me
[1:12:23] said she was on her way to recovery on
[1:12:26] the way home she had a heart
[1:12:29] attack and she
[1:12:31] died she had a heart attack and we went
[1:12:34] in prayer for
[1:12:35] her but she
[1:12:38] went I'm telling you life is very
[1:12:42] short you don't know when your number is
[1:12:44] call and when your day is
[1:12:46] coming I'm saying it to the young Youth
[1:12:49] and send it
[1:12:50] to the ones that think they got time
[1:12:55] you don't know when your time is
[1:12:59] up Caleb said you need to have a check
[1:13:02] in with
[1:13:04] God you need to have a check up where do
[1:13:07] you stand where's your
[1:13:10] life what are you doing do you want
[1:13:13] eternal life do you want to be a
[1:13:16] Christian do you want to be
[1:13:18] saved would you offer this the life that
[1:13:21] you living would you would you be able
[1:13:24] to stand before God and say God I hope
[1:13:26] you accept
[1:13:28] this because one day your life is going
[1:13:31] to be a sacrifice a Living Sacrifice a
[1:13:34] testimony and you're going to present
[1:13:36] you you're going to stand before God and
[1:13:38] you're going to say to God this is my
[1:13:41] life this is what I give you by for what
[1:13:45] you gave me I give it
[1:13:47] this with the master will God be pleased
[1:13:52] if he calls you you want him to accept
[1:13:56] your your life the life that you're
[1:13:58] living the thing you want him to accept
[1:14:02] that are you willing to make that check
[1:14:06] of take your time and say Lord examine
[1:14:09] me Lord I want your will to be done in
[1:14:11] my
[1:14:11] life all your goals and all your
[1:14:14] achievement but one day when you stand
[1:14:16] before him that won't mean
[1:14:19] nothing I told a young man you can be
[1:14:22] healed today but the greatest Miracle is
[1:14:26] your
[1:14:28] soul the greatest miracle for you and
[1:14:31] I is
[1:14:34] not hitting the lottery and getting a
[1:14:37] billion dollars and becoming a
[1:14:40] billionaire your
[1:14:43] greatest Miracle is your
[1:14:47] soul because one soul is worth more than
[1:14:49] 10,000
[1:14:51] wordss are you with me
[1:14:55] and do you
[1:14:56] value your own soul that's worth more
[1:14:59] than 10,000
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:03] Worlds the prophet said one
[1:15:06] soul is worth more than 10,000
[1:15:10] worlds just think about it how valuable
[1:15:13] your soul
[1:15:16] is eternal life that you can live and be
[1:15:20] with him forever
[1:15:23] [Music]
[1:15:26] no more misery no more as Caleb said you
[1:15:29] don't have to make decisions and this
[1:15:31] and
[1:15:32] that go to college and this and that and
[1:15:36] and and be bother with all these
[1:15:41] things when you got eternal life
[1:15:44] everything else becomes
[1:15:48] secondary first the kingdom of God and
[1:15:50] his righteousness and all other things
[1:15:52] he said I'll take care for you it'll be
[1:15:55] added but let me have Jesus first God
