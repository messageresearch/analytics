[29:13] promise there shall be light in the
[29:15] evening time
[29:17] so we thank god that there is light
[29:20] in the midst of this dark hour that
[29:22] we're living in
[29:24] the darkness is getting thicker and
[29:26] thicker
[29:28] the bible says men hard to fail because
[29:31] of fear
[29:32] the things that's coming upon the earth
[29:36] brother and sister i don't want to be
[29:37] here
[29:38] when the wrath of god in the nation of
[29:41] god is pulled out
[29:42] of his fury
[29:45] i don't know about you but i thank god
[29:48] that his grace is upon our lives right
[29:50] now
[29:55] ephesians 1 and 4.
[29:58] should according as he has chosen us
[30:02] where
[30:04] in him before when
[30:07] that we should be holy
[30:09] and without blame before him in love
[30:12] having predestinated us into adoption
[30:15] children
[30:16] by jesus christ to himself
[30:19] according to the good pleasure
[30:21] of
[30:22] his will
[30:24] sixth verse to the praise of the glory
[30:27] of his grace
[30:30] when
[30:31] he has made us what
[30:35] acceptable in the in the beloved amen
[30:38] whom we have redemption through his what
[30:41] blood
[30:43] the forgiveness of sin
[30:47] according to
[30:48] the riches of his grace god bless you in
[30:51] two words you may be seated
[30:55] i tell you just reading this is powerful
[30:59] i'm going to tell you something
[31:00] nothing
[31:02] would take the place of the word of god
[31:06] no quotes of any man myself uh whether
[31:12] it be wesley whether it be luther
[31:14] whether it be whatever
[31:16] nothing would take the place of this
[31:18] bible
[31:21] nothing should be exalted over the word
[31:23] of god
[31:25] are you with me
[31:29] so
[31:30] you gotta understand that nothing
[31:33] nobody
[31:35] nothing
[31:36] should be exalted over this word nothing
[31:39] would take the place
[31:42] prophet of god said if you want to get
[31:43] closer to the lord he said what
[31:47] read the message and pray
[31:50] read what
[31:51] because the bible is the one
[31:54] it's the message
[31:57] see
[31:58] but if you make the message something
[32:00] other than the bible then you've you've
[32:02] lost the whole
[32:04] revelation of the of the message because
[32:06] you've taken something else to make it
[32:09] the message
[32:10] if the message is the bible
[32:13] then
[32:14] read your bible and pray
[32:17] are you with me
[32:19] so we got to understand
[32:21] that
[32:23] we're being restored back to
[32:25] the word
[32:27] are you with me
[32:28] so don't let nothing nothing take the
[32:31] place of your bible
[32:34] or no preacher no quotes no nothing take
[32:38] the place of the bible
[32:40] always see and you can get you can draw
[32:44] nourishment and you can draw strength
[32:46] from this from the word of god are you
[32:49] with me
[32:50] don't let nothing replace that
[32:53] everything else can sound good feel good
[32:56] but the word of god has that
[32:59] nourishment and that nutrients in which
[33:02] the soul needs
[33:04] amen that's the word of life
[33:07] amen
[33:09] praise god everything else can sound
[33:11] better can sound good but the word of
[33:14] god
[33:15] must be exalted above everything
[33:19] are you with me
[33:21] and that's the purpose of the message of
[33:23] the hour to bring us back to the word
[33:26] okay
[33:28] don't let nobody
[33:30] no man deceive you
[33:32] because many folk
[33:35] got this over here and that over there
[33:37] and they make the bible a secondary book
[33:42] are you with me
[33:45] so
[33:46] that's why the blood and the it
[33:49] got me in the seventh verse they make
[33:51] the blood
[33:52] er
[33:54] the blood of 2000 years ago is not for
[33:57] us today
[33:59] the blood of jesus has never lost
[34:04] never lost his power
[34:06] praise god the only way
[34:09] you and i are saved is through the what
[34:12] the blood of jesus
[34:15] without the shedding of blood there's no
[34:18] no remission i'm saying
[34:21] are you with me
[34:22] so don't let nobody down play
[34:25] talk you out of it
[34:28] are you open
[34:30] manipulate
[34:32] maneuver
[34:34] amen
[34:35] the blood of jesus
[34:37] that that's why i hate to stop here for
[34:39] a moment
[34:42] in whom we have redemption through his
[34:46] see
[34:47] it it just sank down in my spirit
[34:50] when when
[34:51] when we read that i said i got to stop
[34:55] we have redemption
[34:56] through
[34:59] his blood
[35:01] amen we had many great preachers many
[35:03] great prophets
[35:05] moses elijah
[35:07] amen jeremiah
[35:09] amen john the baptist amen but
[35:12] redemption is only through the blood of
[35:15] jesus christ
[35:18] are you with me
[35:20] we had great many great prophets many
[35:22] great kings
[35:23] many great priests but
[35:26] he's the high priest of our profession
[35:29] are you up here
[35:33] so let's not
[35:34] i don't know why i got
[35:36] i i mean i went over that way a little
[35:39] bit but
[35:40] keep your eyes focused on one thing if
[35:43] you don't read your bible
[35:45] you you lo
[35:46] you can look at all the internet
[35:49] all the preachers are
[35:51] on the on this and that and if you don't
[35:53] get your substance from this word
[35:57] because yo
[35:58] you know
[35:59] i see why the prophet said read your
[36:01] bible and pray if you want to get close
[36:03] to the lord
[36:04] because you can lose focus
[36:07] you can start looking at men and you can
[36:09] start looking at uh you know what i'm
[36:11] saying this or that he said read your
[36:13] bible and pray
[36:17] okay
[36:18] not say it but do it
[36:21] are you with me
[36:22] a lot of folks have said what he said
[36:24] not do what he said
[36:26] okay
[36:29] it says here
[36:31] redemption through his blood the
[36:33] forgiveness of sin according to the
[36:35] riches of his what
[36:37] grace
[36:38] the eighth verse
[36:40] of ephesians 1 and 8
[36:42] when he has met
[36:45] has a bound to
[36:47] toward us
[36:48] in all wisdom and pruitt
[36:52] having made known unto us the mystery of
[36:55] his what
[36:57] [Music]
[36:59] i believe paul was speaking to them now
[37:02] and it's relevant to us now
[37:06] that god has made known
[37:09] unto us the mystery of his will
[37:12] as he did for that particular age
[37:15] he made known the mystery of his will to
[37:18] that age and in our age amen he's made
[37:22] known the mysteries of his will for this
[37:25] age are you with me
[37:28] so you and i must channel in to the
[37:30] mystery of his will for that age
[37:33] as paul said as a wise master builder i
[37:36] have laid the foundation
[37:38] the foundation has been laid
[37:40] it meant the house has been built we had
[37:42] to head
[37:46] so we at the end now
[37:49] we're at the top of
[37:53] are you with me
[37:55] and we're not looking for headship of
[37:58] man we were looking for christ the word
[38:00] to be the headship
[38:03] so the headstone is grace grace
[38:07] okay
[38:11] oh lord
[38:14] it's going to take god stepping out on
[38:16] the scene and doing some things to open
[38:19] the eyes i wasn't going to talk about
[38:23] um
[38:25] when the eyes were open they knew him
[38:28] and then i'm going to
[38:29] i was going to actually
[38:32] what's in your eyes
[38:37] maybe we'll get to that sunday i don't
[38:39] know
[38:40] oh okay
[38:44] it says having made known us the mystery
[38:47] of his will according to his good
[38:50] pleasure which he has purpose where
[38:54] in himself that in the dispensation of
[38:56] the what
[38:59] he might gather together in one all
[39:02] things in christ
[39:04] both which are in heaven
[39:06] and which are in earth
[39:08] even in him
[39:10] in whom
[39:11] also we have attained
[39:14] an inheritance
[39:17] being predestinated according to the
[39:20] purpose of him who worketh all things
[39:24] after the cancer of what
[39:28] his own will
[39:30] that we should be to the what
[39:34] who first trusted in what
[39:37] christ we got to trust
[39:40] him whom
[39:44] in whom ye also trusted
[39:47] after ye
[39:49] heard the word of truth
[39:52] so you got to hear it first
[39:55] not with your ears but
[39:58] see they had ears to hear but they heard
[40:00] not
[40:02] the eye just see but they was blind
[40:06] are you with me
[40:08] so it's got to be a different ear he
[40:10] that has a
[40:12] ear to hear let him hear what
[40:15] the spirit says to the church
[40:18] so the spirit got to be there in order
[40:22] for you to hear without the spirit of
[40:25] god you don't
[40:27] you
[40:28] you don't hear god
[40:31] god is not you know
[40:33] i was
[40:34] thinking about the prophet said
[40:36] little boy was in the mirror
[40:38] he was from a rural place in the country
[40:41] and way back in the country and he came
[40:44] to the city
[40:45] and he never saw a mural before staying
[40:47] with his
[40:49] relatives
[40:50] and they had a mirror
[40:53] and he was looking in the mirror
[40:55] and he didn't know what it was he saw
[40:57] something in the mirror
[40:59] and he was looking
[41:01] and uh
[41:02] as he was looking in the mirror
[41:04] and he did his hand like that did this
[41:06] that
[41:07] and then all of a sudden
[41:09] the boy discovered he had never seen the
[41:11] mirror before
[41:12] but the boy discovered he said that's me
[41:18] you know
[41:19] and what we look in the mirror of the
[41:22] word
[41:24] and we discover
[41:26] that's me
[41:29] amen but you got to see yourself in the
[41:32] in the mural if you don't never see
[41:35] yourself in the mural amen you don't
[41:38] know how you
[41:41] you know what i'm saying
[41:42] that's what happens when when your seed
[41:45] and you sheep
[41:47] amen it's something about you you
[41:49] recognize yourself in the book
[41:53] amen because amen john can only identify
[41:57] himself in the book amen he had a true
[42:00] identification because
[42:02] amen he saw
[42:04] his life being manifest and what he was
[42:06] manifesting he saw it in the book
[42:10] then he could say i'm i'm the voice
[42:13] of one crying in the wilderness
[42:15] so he knew his
[42:17] and you cannot say that until it's
[42:19] revealed to you
[42:21] until you can see yourself in the book
[42:23] other than that you're taking other
[42:25] people's word
[42:26] you you have confidence in the preacher
[42:29] and you believe in the preacher you have
[42:30] confidence and that's why so many fall
[42:32] away from the faith
[42:35] amen so many fall away from the
[42:37] the truth and from god because they
[42:40] never really they took their parents
[42:42] amen i was born this way i was raised
[42:45] this way and they never saw themselves
[42:48] in the book
[42:51] so the word
[42:53] amen got to talk to you
[42:57] until the word starts talking to you
[43:01] amen
[43:02] and and when the word talk to you
[43:05] amen and you hear the voice of the word
[43:08] it's coming off the pages now it's
[43:10] getting amen it's got a voice
[43:13] and it starts speaking to you
[43:16] amen
[43:18] and if you don't never hear the word
[43:19] speak that's why people don't read the
[43:21] bible because the word don't talk back
[43:26] don't have a conversation but people
[43:28] that read their bible they know the word
[43:29] will speak to you
[43:33] it'll talk to you it's alive
[43:35] it's not dead
[43:38] to others it's just that letter
[43:40] but to others it's alive that's why it
[43:43] speaks back
[43:45] it does something to you
[43:47] when you read your bible you begin to oh
[43:50] something comes off the pages
[43:53] it's not just something it's just about
[43:55] another book like you read and and you
[43:58] get caught up in fantasizing and uh
[44:03] romanticizing and all of that
[44:06] but this bible amen it does something
[44:09] amen to uh wash you
[44:13] it purifies you
[44:15] it sanctifies you it cleans you up
[44:19] it feeds your soul amen
[44:23] the word of god
[44:26] it's got something it's got the
[44:27] nutrients that causes your spiritual man
[44:30] amen to be faith
[44:34] praise god that's why my soul get happy
[44:38] amen it's sweeter than honey in the
[44:40] honeycomb
[44:41] because it it shows me that's me
[44:44] yes lord this is what you've done for me
[44:48] amen oh i'm glad to know amen that i'm
[44:52] in the book
[44:53] praise god i'm not
[44:55] it's not a dead letter
[44:56] that's why you leave your bible at the
[44:58] church
[45:00] because it don't mean much to you
[45:04] they can gather dust it don't
[45:06] it don't speak back
[45:08] until this word becomes more than your
[45:11] necessary food it speaks back
[45:14] praise god
[45:16] you know you know sometimes you get so
[45:18] much word in you you're going through
[45:19] the word and you only never pick up the
[45:21] bible
[45:24] don't have to pick it up sometimes
[45:27] you're just feasting on the word why
[45:29] because the word is so much a part of
[45:31] you
[45:32] you know you meditate on it day and
[45:34] night
[45:35] you begin to quote you begin to quote
[45:37] the bible and the bible began to speak
[45:40] back to you
[45:42] why because it's off the page it's nice
[45:44] it's inside you
[45:46] oh you're with me
[45:48] and when the word get inside you when
[45:50] you're about to go against the words
[45:52] they meant that word to come back
[45:56] are you with me
[45:57] because it's with you
[45:59] that word have i
[46:03] see until it get in your heart
[46:07] you'll keep on sinning against it
[46:09] but god word have i hid in my heart that
[46:12] i
[46:14] are you with me
[46:15] amen when the word is in the inside you
[46:18] don't have to worry about it because the
[46:20] word is a buckle and a shield
[46:24] are you with me
[46:26] oh it's my sword and my shield
[46:30] oh i i thank god amen that the word of
[46:34] god will do what it's saying
[46:36] that is like fire shut up in my bones
[46:40] the word of god amen praise god it's
[46:42] good
[46:44] better than honey in the honeycomb
[46:48] amen praise god
[46:50] it's a lamp into my feet
[46:53] praise god light to my path
[46:56] amen what about it the brother sister is
[46:59] it that good to you
[47:01] don't let nothing replace the word
[47:04] don't let nobody replace the word
[47:06] amen praise god don't get caught up with
[47:09] with all kind of devices and you don't
[47:12] and you leave off the word
[47:14] amen praise god amen
[47:16] god is a jealous god and he said i won't
[47:19] have
[47:20] no other god before me
[47:23] are you with me
[47:25] stay with the book
[47:27] ain't that the bible amen
[47:29] it's the word of god
[47:33] don't let nobody fool you now
[47:40] so
[47:41] i believe people lost focus on what the
[47:43] message is all about
[47:45] it's about the bible
[47:48] are you with me
[47:52] so he says here
[48:05] i'll read the 11th verse in whom also we
[48:07] have attained an inheritance being
[48:10] predestinated according to the purpose
[48:11] of him the work of all things after the
[48:14] council of his own will that we should
[48:16] be to the praise of his glory who first
[48:19] trusted in christ
[48:21] this is what the verse that i choose my
[48:23] subject from and whom
[48:27] ye also trusted
[48:30] after that you heard the word of truth
[48:33] the gospel of your salvation
[48:36] in whom also after ye what
[48:40] not when you believe as the prophet the
[48:43] baptist said we receive the holy ghost
[48:45] when we believe
[48:48] are you with me
[48:50] they said we when we believe we got the
[48:52] holy ghost we're born again we got the
[48:55] holy ghost
[48:56] the bible says here he said
[48:58] whom
[49:00] ye also trusted after you heard the word
[49:03] of truth the gospel of your salvation in
[49:06] whom after ye believed you were what
[49:10] you were sealed with the holy spirit of
[49:13] promise
[49:14] amen that's why paul in the 19th chapter
[49:17] of acts let's just look there for a
[49:19] moment
[49:20] see because some folks say they
[49:23] they receive the holy ghost when they
[49:25] believe they got the holy ghost
[49:29] are you with me
[49:31] and um
[49:33] potentially
[49:36] you know what i'm saying
[49:38] but
[49:39] by the grace of god it says and it came
[49:41] to pass
[49:42] acts 19 and it came to pass uh while
[49:45] polos was was at congress paul having
[49:48] passed through the upper coast came to
[49:50] ephesus and finding certain disciples he
[49:51] said unto them have you received what
[49:55] the holy ghost what
[49:58] since you believed they were believers
[50:00] but they didn't have the holy ghost
[50:02] are you with me
[50:04] so it's many believers
[50:08] that have accepted christ and they're
[50:09] believers
[50:10] have you he didn't say you didn't
[50:12] believe he said since you bleed
[50:15] see some folks are taking said
[50:17] you know if you're not with us you're
[50:19] not a believer
[50:20] you're not even a saved
[50:23] you know you you're nothing
[50:26] but he said have you received the holy
[50:29] ghost since you believe
[50:31] i'm not going to take away believing
[50:35] because the prophet god said
[50:37] he said i see that light over you sister
[50:40] you're a christian
[50:42] you didn't say your baptism your methods
[50:44] you this he said you're a christian
[50:47] the light said that
[50:49] are you with me
[50:50] but some folk are so quick to say you
[50:52] ain't nothing
[50:54] they got more nerves
[50:57] but the angel god and that light said
[51:00] you're christian
[51:02] you said i see that light
[51:04] are you with me just like he can look
[51:06] and see cancer in people and see the
[51:09] tuberculosis and all of that
[51:12] he looked and he said i see that light
[51:15] are you with me
[51:17] i think sometimes we're so
[51:19] quick
[51:20] to condemn
[51:24] are you with me
[51:25] so we got a lot of nerves
[51:28] man i don't know
[51:30] people just so be so excited about what
[51:32] they got to if other folks ain't got it
[51:36] you know let's stop them
[51:39] jesus said leave them alone
[51:43] they talking about me and my name
[51:45] then
[51:46] they
[51:47] ain't against a day for us
[51:49] are you look man
[51:51] you know at harvest time he said i'll do
[51:53] the work
[51:54] not you
[51:56] but i'll do it
[51:58] sit for my angels and they'll do it
[52:01] i believe the word is during the
[52:02] separation now
[52:05] i believe god is sent forth his angels
[52:07] and the word is separating right now
[52:10] but you got to have a revelation not as
[52:12] men suppose now
[52:14] see we we suppose that we're going to
[52:16] get up and we're gonna do this and we're
[52:18] gonna do that and we start separating
[52:20] ourselves no no we don't have to
[52:22] separate ourselves the word or do the
[52:25] separation
[52:27] are you what man
[52:28] praise god what fellowship has
[52:32] amen light with what
[52:36] oh goodness you don't have to worry
[52:37] about it the darkness when the light
[52:39] comes the darling's got to separate
[52:41] itself
[52:42] are you with me
[52:44] the light ain't got the fight against
[52:46] the dog there's all the light got to do
[52:47] is what
[52:49] just shine
[52:51] are you a man
[52:53] praise god that's all you got to whoa
[52:56] darkness get out my way oh no
[53:01] light ain't got no struggle not no fight
[53:04] and god
[53:05] praise god
[53:07] he said this is condemnation because
[53:08] light has come
[53:11] amen praise god
[53:15] and men love what
[53:17] rather than light because what
[53:20] the deeds are evil don't worry about it
[53:22] they'll be manifested
[53:24] praise god amen so the deeds are
[53:27] manifesting themselves
[53:30] are you with me
[53:32] their very action what they do how they
[53:34] live is manifesting itself
[53:39] are you with me
[53:40] so brother and sister don't you try

[1:14:02] praise god but if i'm telling you the
[1:14:04] truth amen

[1:14:10] can i can make mistakes and say
[1:14:12] something i shouldn't have said or i can
[1:14:14] you know
[1:14:16] whatever but the thing is you can come
[1:14:18] to me and say brother simmons why did
[1:14:20] you say that
[1:14:22] you know what i'm saying
[1:14:24] because if i said something
[1:14:26] intentionally to hurt you
[1:14:28] or to talk about you or talk down to you
[1:14:31] but if i say something to help you and
[1:14:33] you
[1:14:34] received it the other way when i meant
[1:14:37] it for good
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:41] praise god
[1:14:43] but see what happens amen the devil will
[1:14:46] take the word by the time it gets to
[1:14:48] your ear and he'll take it and twist it
[1:14:53] it's supposed to be for your good but
[1:14:54] when the devil gets you all twisted up
[1:14:57] in your head you say pastor don't care
[1:14:59] nothing about me
[1:15:02] see what i'm saying
[1:15:03] pastor don't love me
[1:15:06] pastor
[1:15:08] got his picks all kind of stuff that
[1:15:13] i'm gonna tell you something it ain't a
[1:15:15] buddy-buddy friendship
[1:15:17] it's the word
[1:15:19] amen
[1:15:20] we come for the word and the word alone
[1:15:25] amen thank god that we can love one
[1:15:27] another
[1:15:28] praise god and i'm gonna tell you
[1:15:30] something
[1:15:31] i think paul
[1:15:33] he had somebody he was closer to
[1:15:36] and barnabas had somebody he was closer
[1:15:38] to oh you wouldn't man
[1:15:40] so it was happening that all things
[1:15:43] weren't the good they went one right
[1:15:44] direction the other went the other
[1:15:45] direction and it came back together and
[1:15:48] the holy ghost shoes both for direction
[1:15:51] are you what man
[1:15:52] see the holy ghost can do it but you see
[1:15:55] somebody say well
[1:15:56] what folks want i'm gonna say that old
[1:15:58] devil
[1:16:00] john martin we want to go back
[1:16:03] and see about his family and we're out
[1:16:05] here on the missionary trip and he's
[1:16:07] going back oh lord man don't come back
[1:16:09] with all the morning back with me
[1:16:12] but they didn't fall out
[1:16:14] barnum said come on go with me
[1:16:17] are you with me
[1:16:19] so it's something about god
[1:16:22] god will work on things if you keep the
[1:16:24] right spirit regardless of amen how we
[1:16:27] different if we keep the right spirit
[1:16:29] god will walk it all to our good
[1:16:32] but if one of us get a bad attitude or
[1:16:34] bad spirit then it'll it
[1:16:37] it can do a lot of damage
[1:16:39] you don't never get placed to the devil
[1:16:42] don't never let the enemy come in
[1:16:45] [Music]
[1:16:46] and accuse the brothers
[1:16:48] amen said you know the prophet said they
[1:16:51] didn't mean it
[1:16:52] and you got to always keep that attitude
[1:16:55] they didn't mean to hurt me they didn't
[1:16:56] mean to say that they didn't mean that
[1:16:59] isn't that right
[1:17:00] and when you keep that kind of love and
[1:17:02] that kind of forgiveness things will
[1:17:04] work out
[1:17:06] what a beautiful home you could have
[1:17:08] what a beautiful marriage you could have
[1:17:11] what a beautiful family you can have
[1:17:13] what a beautiful job you can go in and
[1:17:15] worry

[1:17:32] amen just be sweet
[1:17:34] just be loving and be kind and god will
[1:17:37] work it out
[1:17:38] praise god

[1:25:18] god
[1:25:18] this is what he's saying to the seal of
[1:25:20] god children
[1:25:22] this is what he's saying ephesians 4 and
[1:25:24] 30. he said
[1:25:26] and grieve not the what
[1:25:31] he said if it was possible he deceived
[1:25:33] the very elect if it was possible
[1:25:36] he said
[1:25:38] whereby you're sealed until what
[1:25:42] now
[1:25:44] this is this is what i like here
[1:25:46] because
[1:25:48] you can rejoice because you seal
[1:25:51] but he's saying to you that a sealed he

[1:26:20] clamor and what
[1:26:23] evil speaking be what

[1:26:32] and what this is what i like this is
[1:26:34] what i like and be what
[1:26:40] i ain't speaking to her because she got
[1:26:42] a bad spirit

[1:26:51] she's a hypocrite he's a hypocrite come
[1:26:54] on

[1:26:59] god wants that
[1:27:01] his attributes to flow out from you
[1:27:05] just be kind regardless of what
[1:27:07] condition another individual is in he's

[1:27:49] well i know i know
[1:27:51] let it go
[1:27:56] i ain't gonna let it go okay hold on to
[1:27:58] it i can't help you
[1:28:01] all the preaching in the world can't
[1:28:02] help you
[1:28:04] praise god jesus christ himself came
[1:28:06] down he can't help you
[1:28:09] why because you won't let it go
[1:28:14] we want to hold on to
[1:28:18] the pain and the hurt and the
[1:28:19] disappointment
[1:28:22] don't hold on to it
[1:28:24] let it go
[1:28:26] you know
[1:28:27] how long do it too long already let it
[1:28:30] go
[1:28:31] it's a god
[1:28:33] oh let me let me show you what he says
[1:28:35] at an end he said be kind what
[1:28:39] not to some people
[1:28:44] amen
[1:28:46] one two one
[1:28:48] that's that's you just be kind to
[1:28:49] everybody
[1:28:51] okay
[1:28:52] he says
[1:28:53] and what
[1:28:55] tend to hearted
[1:28:59] i find sometimes
[1:29:00] we're too we're too rough
[1:29:04] sometimes we can be a little too
[1:29:07] rough
[1:29:08] to be christians
[1:29:11] sometimes we can say things that the
[1:29:13] holy spirit would grieve the very holy
[1:29:15] spirit
[1:29:19] sometimes we can think things that would
[1:29:21] cause the holy spirit to be grieved
[1:29:27] he said grieve not the holy spirit so it
[1:29:30] must be that you can have the holy
[1:29:33] spirit and you can cause the holy spirit
[1:29:34] to be what
[1:29:36] grieve so he said grieve not the holy
[1:29:39] spirit if you want god to stay
[1:29:42] with you
[1:29:43] you can you this is the way you keep god
[1:29:46] the holy spirit you keep the seal
[1:29:49] praise god and know that you're sealed
[1:29:52] this is the way you can maintain
[1:29:55] this is your security this is your home
[1:29:59] he said
[1:30:01] be kind
[1:30:03] uh
[1:30:04] one
[1:30:05] one towards another tender hearted and
[1:30:07] what
[1:30:09] for what
[1:30:11] i already forgave him i told him i was
[1:30:13] sorry i forgave him
[1:30:16] yeah i believe that
[1:30:20] your actions showing that you didn't
[1:30:21] forgive them
[1:30:24] because every time you look around you
[1:30:26] got to bring up that same situation
[1:30:30] and when you bring it up
[1:30:33] your pain returned
[1:30:35] you know what brother branham said he
[1:30:37] said
[1:30:38] your faith
[1:30:40] causes sickness to go and your unbelief
[1:30:42] will cause you to work
[1:30:45] isn't that right
[1:30:46] and so what happens
[1:30:49] amen yo
[1:30:51] what you speak
[1:30:53] you forgave for a moment then you spoke
[1:30:56] it right back
[1:30:57] you took your forgiveness right by
[1:31:00] you forgave
[1:31:02] and you said and it was real peaceful
[1:31:04] and real nice
[1:31:05] and then next thing you know
[1:31:09] yeah
[1:31:10] yeah but
[1:31:12] when you overtalk yourself and you're
[1:31:14] over
[1:31:15] everything just come right back on you
[1:31:17] same situation and you never get victory
[1:31:21] you never get the victory in your life
[1:31:24] because why you keep on bringing that
[1:31:26] same thing up over and over and over and
[1:31:29] over and again
[1:31:32] you need to let it go
[1:31:36] until you let it go amen it's gonna keep
[1:31:38] on that hurt the pain the sorrow
[1:31:41] everything that you went through you're
[1:31:43] going to keep on going through it over
[1:31:44] and over and over in your mind
[1:31:47] the other person could be going on about
[1:31:49] the business ain't thinking about it no
[1:31:51] more but you holding on to it
[1:31:56] the person that caused all the hurt and
[1:31:58] all the pain going on and you up there
[1:32:00] still taking it around
[1:32:04] are you with me
[1:32:06] brother and sister i said let it
[1:32:10] let it go
[1:32:13] okay let it go
[1:32:16] and half of the time ain't nothing
[1:32:17] something the devil got there anyway
[1:32:20] you have that what the cause what
[1:32:23] division
[1:32:26] to divide and conquer
[1:32:28] amen
[1:32:30] he says
[1:32:32] forgiving one another even as
[1:32:35] god for what
[1:32:38] has what
[1:32:40] well
[1:32:42] you remember when
[1:32:43] that's why
[1:32:45] folk dead and gone you still ain't
[1:32:47] forgiven
[1:32:49] now i know the dead folk ain't did
[1:32:51] nothing
[1:32:54] yeah they did something to me when
[1:32:56] they're living
[1:32:58] they still living to you
[1:33:01] why cause you still bringing up that
[1:33:02] same stuff
[1:33:05] they might as well be living because
[1:33:06] you're hurting your pain
[1:33:08] you're still living off of that and
[1:33:10] that's causing a root of bitterness
[1:33:13] in you
[1:33:16] and that thing is working until you let
[1:33:18] that go you still gonna have a lot of
[1:33:20] bitterness and it's going to come out
[1:33:22] and you'll you cannot walk in perfect
[1:33:25] love because you're living in the past
[1:33:27] amen
[1:33:29] and everything that happened to you in
[1:33:30] the past it began to work because you
[1:33:33] see it coming again at you and you're
[1:33:35] trying to protect
[1:33:36] yourself from being hurt again
[1:33:39] as long as you're trying to protect
[1:33:40] yourself from being hurt
[1:33:42] oh lord have mercy
[1:33:50] praise god
[1:33:56] even when folks try to help you you
[1:33:58] think they're trying to hurt you
[1:34:03] are you with me
[1:34:06] we begin to get a little
[1:34:10] when anything look like it's coming your
[1:34:12] way
[1:34:13] sometimes we can't even receive love
[1:34:17] because we think something is behind it
[1:34:22] are you with me
[1:34:25] let's just love one another
[1:34:28] love god with all your heart
[1:34:31] with everything you've got
[1:34:34] are you a man
[1:34:35] once you love god right
[1:34:38] it'll begin
[1:34:40] little seven rainbow colors will begin
[1:34:42] to come forth out of you
[1:34:44] are you with me because you have the
[1:34:46] covenant of god and the blood apply
[1:34:49] are you with me
[1:34:51] then you'll find faith virtue knowledge

[1:44:07] hey man you appreciate the word tonight
[1:44:13] you know i really appreciate he said a
[1:44:14] lot of things tonight that some golden
[1:44:16] nuggets say man
[1:44:18] you know i was thinking about that
[1:44:20] something when how he was saying that
[1:44:22] you know the lord is still working on us
[1:44:24] and none of us perfect
[1:44:26] it reminded me something uh
[1:44:27] i think deacon walker was saying the
[1:44:29] other week
[1:44:30] he was talking about a song
[1:44:32] he said that it took the lord only a
[1:44:34] week to make the earth the sun the moon
[1:44:36] and the stars
[1:44:38] but after all these years he's still
[1:44:39] working on me
[1:44:41] and i believe that with all of my heart
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:44] you know i really thank god tonight for
[1:44:46] his grace and his mercy appreciate the
[1:44:48] word like i said don't let it slip
[1:44:51] but those nuggets that we heard and
[1:44:53] those things ponder on them
[1:44:55] go home and ponder on them in your heart
[1:44:57] i believe it's some releasing
[1:45:00] and some freedom that we can get from
[1:45:03] some things that got us bound if we can
[1:45:05] only learn how as he was saying to let
[1:45:07] go amen
[1:45:08] let go and let god how many believe that
[1:45:11] tonight
[1:45:12] i really thank god as he was saying you
[1:45:14] know uh a lot of times
[1:45:18] some people may think that the preacher
[1:45:19] is preaching at them or on them but they
[1:45:23] understand that's why that that the word
[1:45:25] ain't just for the people but the
[1:45:26] preacher is getting it too
[1:45:28] a lot of times everybody tell me say man
[1:45:31] you say come on after everything you say
[1:45:34] but i said you know why because i be
[1:45:35] preaching to myself
[1:45:37] a lot of times that you're ministering
[1:45:39] things be coming out you don't even it's
[1:45:42] just coming out and as it's coming out
[1:45:44] i'll be saying come on because i'll be
[1:45:46] preaching to myself and a lot of times
[1:45:48] what it is the word come to you first so
[1:45:51] you have to do all the repenting and and
[1:45:53] laying before god before you give it to
[1:45:55] the people because that's what the
[1:45:57] spirit said to you
