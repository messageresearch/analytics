[35:01] bestest friend here they drove all the
[35:04] way four hours to be with us brother
[35:06] Carl his and her husband we just want to
[35:10] share a short
[35:12] testimony I think it's about 7 years
[35:15] ago I was at my house in Fort
[35:19] Lauderdale and I was walking through the
[35:23] door and I heard a voice saying there
[35:26] there's a number on your telephone go
[35:28] and call it
[35:30] now and I was still walking and the
[35:32] voice said call the number now but I
[35:36] know the voice of the Lord I said yes
[35:39] Lord and I saw the number but it was a
[35:42] strange number because my phone was
[35:44] changed and I didn't know the number so
[35:46] I dialed the
[35:48] number and I
[35:50] said I was asked to call this number and
[35:52] brother car picked up the phone he said
[35:55] sister Hannah sister Hannah
[35:57] I didn't know it was him he said I'm not
[36:01] talking about you here they were in
[36:03] Georgia she and brother Carl were
[36:06] sitting around the table I think
[36:08] breakfast time yeah and they were having
[36:10] breakfast but she was in tears and she
[36:12] was burdened and she was crying and he
[36:15] is telling her I want you to meet this n
[36:17] sister I want you to talk to this n
[36:19] sister and she could pray for you take
[36:24] [Music]
[36:25] yeah so at that time um I was going
[36:31] through a real hard trial um my husband
[36:33] and I my husband had served 23 years in
[36:37] the military and um he had retired and
[36:43] he took it really
[36:44] hard so um we had also been in church
[36:49] most of our adult life um we came into
[36:53] the message we did not grow up in the
[36:55] message but um um we came into the
[36:58] message and my husband I think um we
[37:02] raised our kids in church but I think
[37:05] for the most part he was about 75%
[37:08] committed and then um when he retired
[37:12] from the military it sent him into a
[37:15] crisis um in a lot of ways and then the
[37:19] enemy just came right
[37:21] in and it almost tore our marriage
[37:25] apart and and our marriage
[37:28] was I would say for the most part we
[37:32] probably in the world's eyes had about
[37:35] 1%
[37:37] chance and that morning we had met with
[37:40] um brother Caesar he was trying to help
[37:43] us in every way that he could and we had
[37:46] met um at a restaurant and my husband
[37:51] had gotten so mad that morning he had
[37:54] got up from the table and left and he
[37:56] said said that's it he said I'm done
[37:59] we're
[38:01] through and I was sitting there
[38:04] devastated and brother Caesar started
[38:07] speaking about sister Hannah and I had
[38:09] never met her and he said you have to
[38:11] meet this sister because the Lord is
[38:14] with her and the Lord Works through
[38:18] her and I said because I had nobody in
[38:21] my life but brother Caesar and his wife
[38:24] and I really needed somebody and I was
[38:27] devastated and I said what am I going to
[38:29] do he's gone and I knew when my husband
[38:32] got up from that table I knew he meant
[38:34] what he said he was gone that was
[38:39] it about that time sister Hannah called
[38:43] like Al the blue she said who am I
[38:44] speaking to the Lord just told me to
[38:46] call this number and she said I lost all
[38:48] the phone numbers in my phone and who is
[38:51] this and and brother Caesar just laughed
[38:55] he said we were just speaking about you
[38:58] and
[38:59] um I explained my situation to her and
[39:03] she said well let's just
[39:07] pray and she she started to pray and she
[39:10] said Lord she
[39:13] said I ask you I just a real simple
[39:16] prayer and I forget exactly I can't
[39:18] quote it
[39:20] exactly I said holy spirit go and arrest
[39:23] him wherever he is and bring him back to
[39:25] this table and let them renew their vows
[39:29] like the old time and let them open the
[39:31] gap of communication what they don't
[39:33] have but I never knew that was a problem
[39:36] she just said she needed prayer
[39:39] and so we sat there and then sister
[39:42] Hannah started giving some testimonies
[39:44] about what God had been doing in in her
[39:48] local assembly and so we just sat there
[39:51] and a few minutes later my husband
[39:53] walked back through the door and he
[39:55] looks so
[39:57] defeated and he just sat there and sat
[40:00] down at the table and um sister Hannah
[40:04] kept giving testimonies a few more
[40:06] testimonies and she said well she said I
[40:09] need to go God bless you and she
[40:11] introduced herself to my husband and and
[40:14] that was that
[40:16] and I'm sitting there and I'm just
[40:18] smiling because he didn't know that
[40:21] sister Hannah had prayed for the Holy
[40:23] Spirit to arrest him and bring him back
[40:26] and he was sitting there and he looked a
[40:27] little confused but he said I don't know
[40:31] what happened but he
[40:33] said something just happened and I had
[40:35] to come back
[40:41] [Music]
[40:43] here
[40:46] so so it's been seven years and I have
[40:50] to tell you I have the best
[40:55] marriage
[41:01] my husband is now 100%
[41:13] committed and I have the best
[41:15] friend in the whole wide
[41:18] world that I could ever ask
[41:21] for so God can take a very isolated
[41:25] lonely
[41:28] person who is a living testimony of
[41:32] Grace a broken
[41:35] marriage a broken
[41:37] home and with one simple
[41:40] prayer
[41:42] restore
[41:44] everything

[1:02:13] little bit now I knew them as just
[1:02:15] little little ones
[1:02:17] amen I remember when I'd preached I'd
[1:02:20] stand at the door at the old church
[1:02:22] there and they come and say brother Paul
[1:02:23] I love how you You
[1:02:26] Preach I try to preach simple break it
[1:02:29] down to that the little ones with Hest
[1:02:31] I'm not too intellectual
[1:02:34] anyway amen I've got a a pretty big
[1:02:38] Bible I was wondering if to walk with a
[1:02:40] smaller Bible or my usual this is what I
[1:02:44] usually use now um you know getting on a
[1:02:48] little bit in age so you need to see the
[1:02:50] prince a little
[1:02:53] bigger
[1:02:55] so don't don't don't worry too much
[1:02:57] about it and this is just a little
[1:02:59] notebook it's just about two or three
[1:03:01] pages some little notes okay so I'll try
[1:03:05] not to be too long usually when you come
[1:03:07] from Trinidad while they're preaching
[1:03:08] some of the
[1:03:09] ministers we started around 10:00 10:30
[1:03:13] and when it reached 1:00 2:00 they say
[1:03:16] well we're now moving on to the third
[1:03:20] poll we got to go an hour again right
[1:03:23] but I'm not one of d
[1:03:26] right some Churches they're like
[1:03:30] services will be about 6 hours so you
[1:03:33] know I re I guess you know Christians
[1:03:36] don't die right they sleep so by the 6th
[1:03:39] hour you're get in that sixth
[1:03:41] [Laughter]
[1:03:47] Dimension
[1:03:50] amen amen I think I'm going to get in
[1:03:53] trouble when I go back back to turn
[1:03:58] that I hope this sermon doesn't go
[1:04:01] around the
[1:04:03] world Amen the Lord Rich to bless
[1:04:07] you I've toally enjoyed myself and you
[1:04:10] know

[1:04:14] Spirit have Liberty amen and freedom you
[1:04:17] know Friday some of you all just held
[1:04:19] back a little
[1:04:21] bit yeah especially at the end of the
[1:04:23] service you should have just let the
[1:04:24] Lord just flow and and and use you in
[1:04:27] whatever way and you know because there
[1:04:29] might be somebody depending on the power
[1:04:32] of God demonstrated in your life
[1:04:35] amen that might be the time of their
[1:04:37] Victory or their breakthrough that they
[1:04:39] so need and so desire so so don't hold
[1:04:43] back amen you feel the spirit and the
[1:04:45] presence among upon you you just let the
[1:04:48] Lord have his way and flow freely
[1:04:50] through you all amen that's what we
[1:04:52] spoke about on Friday amen come to that
[1:04:55] place where the Holy Spirit Will flow so
[1:04:57] freely through US amen it won't be us
[1:05:00] speaking it'll be the holy spirit
[1:05:03] amen it'll be him moving through you and
[1:05:08] I well as I told you on Friday I I'm not
[1:05:11] one very good with um naming a Ser
[1:05:14] because many of times I start with
[1:05:16] something I end up somewhere
[1:05:18] else so my sermon could have lots of
[1:05:21] names this morning possibly all things
[1:05:23] are Poss possible or when two
[1:05:25] omnipotents
[1:05:28] meet or perfect Faith
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:36] but we just want the Lord to have his
[1:05:39] way
[1:05:43] amen you know the prophet
[1:05:46] said that m is
[1:05:51] omnipotent you believe that yes sir
[1:05:56] I want to read it to you a little bit
[1:05:58] amen would that be
[1:06:01] fine amen we we spoke about being
[1:06:03] redeemed back to all that Adam had lost
[1:06:06] and that fellowship and the fellowship
[1:06:08] that Adam had with God and he he lived
[1:06:10] in that presence
[1:06:12] constantly
[1:06:14] amen and and Adam had power to speak to
[1:06:16] that tree tree there and it said tree
[1:06:20] you be taken up and be planted over
[1:06:21] there it'll go amen it had to obey his
[1:06:25] word
[1:06:32] amen well when Adam
[1:06:36] fell that Fellowship that man had with
[1:06:38] God was
[1:06:40] broken but God had an objective behind
[1:06:43] all of
[1:06:44] that he had so much attributes within
[1:06:47] himself that he needed to
[1:06:49] display if there wasn't someone Fallen
[1:06:52] how would he we know what Redemption is
[1:06:54] all
[1:06:56] about if you're not sick how how are you
[1:06:59] going to know what it feels like to be
[1:07:01] really
[1:07:04] well how do you know something is good
[1:07:06] unless you ain't got the
[1:07:08] bad so there's a purpose in it all God
[1:07:12] had a purpose in it all amen and he
[1:07:15] wanted to express himself to the
[1:07:19] fullness
[1:07:22] amen well he's got a bride
[1:07:24] in this
[1:07:26] day and he wants to express himself in
[1:07:29] the fullness in his bride isn't that the
[1:07:31] truth amen not just a a a a defeated
[1:07:35] group of people just
[1:07:37] amen you know just going along with the
[1:07:40] flow sometime we feel good sometime we
[1:07:42] feel bad now that that's we do go
[1:07:44] through those times right but there's a
[1:07:46] purpose in it
[1:07:48] all amen we got mountains we got valleys
[1:07:51] but there's a purpose behind it all amen
[1:07:53] hey amen
[1:07:55] amen well after man had
[1:07:58] fallen and that connection was
[1:08:00] broken when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:04] came He restored back that
[1:08:07] connection the prophet in the message
[1:08:09] the patma vision says he said every
[1:08:12] obstacle from human beings that might be
[1:08:16] connected like in the Garden of Eden he
[1:08:18] cut every obstacle
[1:08:20] amen I said he cut every obstacle
[1:08:24] so there's nothing to hinder us now from
[1:08:29] receiving the full blessings of the
[1:08:34] Lord he says no man I I was going to
[1:08:37] choke it that mean he was going to hold
[1:08:38] it back he wasn't going to say it but he
[1:08:41] he said but I'm going to say it he says
[1:08:44] man is
[1:08:47] omnipotent you don't believe that but he
[1:08:49] is a man fully surrendered to God so not
[1:08:53] just a man as I said to you on S on
[1:08:56] Friday
[1:08:58] that he's calling us to that place of
[1:09:00] full surrender we where you know I said
[1:09:05] we got to be more sincere it's not that
[1:09:06] you're not sincere but you got to be
[1:09:08] more sincere now he's calling you to a
[1:09:12] higher level it's not that you're not a
[1:09:13] Christian or not a Believer yes you are
[1:09:15] it's not that you don't have the Holy
[1:09:16] Ghost you've got
[1:09:18] it but he wants to bring you now to
[1:09:21] another
[1:09:22] level isn't that the truth yes sir he
[1:09:26] says he says you don't believe that but
[1:09:28] he is a man fully surrendered to God is
[1:09:33] omnipotent did he not say in Mark 11:22
[1:09:36] whatsoever things you say and don't
[1:09:38] doubt in your heart so it's not just
[1:09:41] what you
[1:09:44] say Amen you can't doubt in your
[1:09:47] heart that's faith without a doubt now
[1:09:51] amen he says and don't doubt in your
[1:09:56] heart it'll come to pass you can have
[1:10:00] what you've
[1:10:01] said what happens when two omnipotents
[1:10:04] meet when God and man comes together two
[1:10:08] omnipotents imagine God and a man with
[1:10:11] perfect faith comes together oh
[1:10:15] Hallelujah what's going to happen when
[1:10:20] God comes on the scene and there's a man
[1:10:23] and with that perfect
[1:10:26] Faith something's got to take
[1:10:28] place the miraculous got to take place
[1:10:31] the supernatural's got to take place
[1:10:34] it's got
[1:10:38] to
[1:10:41] amen whatever you'd say with that
[1:10:44] creative power of omnipotence of God
[1:10:47] knowing that he's promised
[1:10:50] it and said it in his word it creates a
[1:10:53] power
[1:10:54] that goes out yonder and brings things
[1:10:57] to pass things that is not it makes them
[1:11:01] as though they are because two
[1:11:04] omnipotents have met there he stands
[1:11:07] isn't he wonderful that's what you've
[1:11:10] been restored back
[1:11:11] to
[1:11:14] amen
[1:11:18] now let let me read something to you
[1:11:20] here
[1:11:22] again
[1:11:28] let me see if I find it
[1:11:33] amen oh my I can't where did I write
[1:11:37] that down
[1:11:39] anyway you see I'm not very good at this
[1:11:45] right I'm depending on
[1:11:52] him thank you Lord
[1:11:56] Jesus God in the message fate
[1:11:59] 1961 God doesn't have little weak
[1:12:03] spots you know we got some muscles a
[1:12:06] little bit weaker and some really

[1:28:20] revealed no this is not this is not mind
[1:28:22] over matter that's the reason why many
[1:28:24] of people have fallen away you know they
[1:28:26] tried to figure out all these spiritual
[1:28:28] things
[1:28:30] mentally some of them want to see
[1:28:32] certain Supernatural things they and
[1:28:34] they try to manufacture things and and
[1:28:37] and and when they get disappointed they
[1:28:38] fall away no no no you've learned that

[1:29:08] you want to just put your as side here
[1:29:09] for a little
[1:29:11] while praise the Lord anyhow but you
[1:29:14] know some of us get disappointed with

[1:29:27] Calvary now you love him too much to
[1:29:29] fail him you he said stand still right

[1:29:47] this Satan will be powerless before
[1:29:53] her do you believe that's you he's
[1:29:55] speaking
[1:29:57] about the
[1:29:59] bride the true
[1:30:02] church well tell him you're
[1:30:05] powerless you're
[1:30:07] powerless in front of
[1:30:11] Jesus amen he was the fullness of the
[1:30:14] word and the word is abiding in me
[1:30:19] now who am I I'm a of my
[1:30:24] savior I'm that Revelation for the hour
[1:30:28] isn't that the truth we're to be that
[1:30:29] lived voice we to be that scripture
[1:30:32] being fulfilled in our day there's a
[1:30:35] portion of the word allotted for you and
[1:30:38] I but we've got a mighty message in this
[1:30:41] day yes
[1:30:44] sir yes sir and it's been Vindicated to
[1:30:48] be the
[1:30:50] truth
[1:30:54] was there a devil could have stood
[1:30:56] before that man that was so fully
[1:30:58] surrendered in the hands of God in our
[1:31:01] day God waved that before us he did it
[1:31:04] for a
[1:31:06] reason you know I grew up in a
[1:31:10] message Dad was a minister first message
[1:31:14] minister in Pastor in in the island of
[1:31:18] Trinidad he took the message many of
[1:31:20] places so I grew up in a m message
[1:31:22] hearing a message seeing how you live as
[1:31:25] a message believing person
[1:31:27] but that ain't going to save
[1:31:31] me I needed to know something know that
[1:31:35] I know that I
[1:31:38] know you know and i' played the message
[1:31:41] after Daddy had gone and they came out
[1:31:44] with the CDs and you could play one
[1:31:45] message after another after the tips you
[1:31:47] know for I knew it in the times of the
[1:31:49] big reals like that
[1:31:53] and then they got the little cassets and
[1:31:55] then they got the the the
[1:31:59] CDs so you'd play it all night some I'd
[1:32:03] fall asleep listening and one
[1:32:06] night I woke up and I hear that prayer
[1:32:09] line I just like something struck
[1:32:13] me that's nothing but the Lord Jesus
[1:32:16] Christ that's not a man
[1:32:18] there that's not my the Lord Jesus
[1:32:21] Christ in not
[1:32:28] man I'm begin to see that message in a
[1:32:31] different way
[1:32:36] now began to feed on this a little
[1:32:39] differently now then
[1:32:43] lately it seems as though it's become so
[1:32:46] new to
[1:32:47] me I've been in a message all my
[1:32:50] life but see God's taking us from
[1:32:53] another stage to another
[1:32:55] stage higher and
[1:32:59] higher closer and
[1:33:02] closer the Rapture is at
[1:33:05] hand some is beginning to take place and
[1:33:08] last year you know our little family
[1:33:10] group we we started studying the Holy
[1:33:13] Ghost
[1:33:14] series and after the Holy Ghost series I
[1:33:16] went onto the adoption
[1:33:18] series after the adoption series I went
[1:33:20] onto the church ages I me really
[1:33:23] studying
[1:33:26] this
[1:33:28] and after the church ages did both the
[1:33:31] church ages the sermons preached and the
[1:33:33] book
[1:33:34] amen together doing them
[1:33:36] together and then I went on to Daniel 70
[1:33:39] weeks before Daniel 70 weeks sorry
[1:33:42] Revelation chapter 4 and 5 I started
[1:33:44] following you know how the prophet
[1:33:46] brought deeper truths you know little by
[1:33:50] little and it's the Holy Spirit was
[1:33:52] doing that you know in the prophet's
[1:33:54] life and these things it's for you and
[1:33:58] I so I want to get all that's for
[1:34:02] me and then I went on to Daniel 70 weeks
[1:34:05] and from
[1:34:07] there did some of those the sermons in
[1:34:10] 1962 and then I said I'm going on to the
[1:34:12] Seven
[1:34:14] Seals
[1:34:17] amen and just around the turn of the
[1:34:20] year I started it and and we started the
[1:34:23] first seal and we were going through one
[1:34:25] by
[1:34:26] one and I had a dream somewhere early
[1:34:29] part of the year I'm fascinated by by
[1:34:33] the solar system and all these
[1:34:37] things and I dreamt I had awoken at
[1:34:40] night and I now not all dreams are of
[1:34:42] the Lord right but I believe this was of
[1:34:48] him I dream I went out in the night of
[1:34:51] this
[1:34:53] and I looked up in the
[1:34:55] sky and I can see all the constellations
[1:34:58] drawn
[1:35:02] out when I looked up though there was an
[1:35:04] eagle I was
[1:35:08] seeing so I said you know when I got up
[1:35:10] in the morning I said I got to search
[1:35:11] that message and fin a because I know
[1:35:14] you know constellation with the eagle in
[1:35:16] it you know proph spoke about that
[1:35:19] mother Eagle up there and and I can't
[1:35:22] remember the exact quat
[1:35:23] anyway
[1:35:25] and everything was so real and so
[1:35:30] clear I began to see all these things
[1:35:32] and then I saw the moon and the moon was
[1:35:35] like so close right up I'm like so close
[1:35:37] to it but there was this great big black
[1:35:39] thing over it but I'm seeing beyond
[1:35:42] that and I'm seeing it it's all in its
[1:35:50] fullness when I awoke I said
[1:35:54] my you know some dreams when you're
[1:35:56] awake you feel the presence of the Lord
[1:35:58] there in that
[1:36:00] room just around that time briam dreamt
[1:36:04] he saw me hug the Lord
[1:36:07] Jesus and when I hugg the Lord Jesus the
[1:36:10] whole Bible
[1:36:14] Hallelujah became just open up to
[1:36:20] me and now as I study I I told you like
[1:36:23] just something just flicked on I
[1:36:25] couldn't do it you you thirsted for this
[1:36:27] all your
[1:36:29] life you're longed for this all your
[1:36:33] life it goes beyond
[1:36:35] intellect we we've understood it
[1:36:38] mentally the prophet says the greater
[1:36:39] part of faith we got is mental Faith but
[1:36:42] it's got to come down here it's got to
[1:36:44] become a divine revelation spiritual
[1:36:47] Revelation so when you hear I'm speaking
[1:36:49] about the omnipotent God
[1:36:52] it's not up here I'm speaking about I'm
[1:36:54] speaking about down
[1:36:55] here I know he's the omnipotent
[1:37:05] God and not only is he
[1:37:08] omnipotent but if I let him have his way
[1:37:11] with
[1:37:11] me let him have freedom and liberty to
[1:37:15] flow freely through
[1:37:20] me
[1:37:31] I'll
[1:37:33] see that man fully surrendered to
[1:37:37] God that omnipotent
[1:37:40] man you'd see it that that's what I'm
[1:37:44] here today to challenge your
[1:37:50] fate now now if you really believe it
[1:37:52] that Holy Spirit Will anoint that Faith
[1:37:54] you know yes if you believe it without a
[1:37:56] doubt because it's faith that pleases
[1:37:59] him and that's what he's looking for
[1:38:02] will I find fith when I
[1:38:04] come without faith it's impossible to
[1:38:07] please God remember when the prophet had
[1:38:09] that that experience with the
[1:38:12] squirrels there was that
[1:38:16] scripture that he was baffled all about
[1:38:18] so long and then he went out hunting you
[1:38:21] see there's a time and a season for
[1:38:23] everything that's why I believe we're in
[1:38:24] a special season you know brother
[1:38:26] Simmons was asking me he said did were
[1:38:28] you listening to my sermons the last
[1:38:30] month or so I said
[1:38:32] no but I think I just flipped through
[1:38:34] and I saw perfect Faith he was speaking
[1:38:36] on perfect Faith some time ago but I
[1:38:38] wasn't listening said man you you you
[1:38:41] you preached on Friday what I've been
[1:38:43] saying for the last month or
[1:38:45] so and I spoke to brother car last night
[1:38:48] he came over at the hotel to have some
[1:38:50] fellowship
[1:38:52] and he said brother he said what you
[1:38:54] were saying
[1:38:55] there he knew that's he said that's what
[1:38:59] God's been calling me
[1:39:03] to that's what God is calling all of us
[1:39:08] to it's required of
[1:39:15] us this bride won't
[1:39:20] fail
[1:39:23] I said this bride won't fail there's an
[1:39:25] anointing in this age that has come

[1:40:13] one that really is running the
[1:40:15] show yeah that one when it strikes deep
[1:40:19] down in there

[1:40:26] consecration a greater consecration you
