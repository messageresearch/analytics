[38:09] have been arraigned and finally and
[38:11] clean and white for the fine linen is
[38:15] the righteousness of the Saints may be
[38:17] seated
[38:18] [Music]
[38:20] God is good amen
[38:23] we're coming down to the
[38:28] the marriage of the lamb and
[38:32] and uh
[38:35] we talked about
[38:37] we want to say are you ready to be
[38:40] married
[38:42] are you
[38:44] prepared are you ready
[38:46] to be married
[38:51] CNN
[38:53] Young
[38:55] people
[38:57] when they get a certain age they're
[38:59] looking forward to
[39:01] it's a normal thing to look forward to
[39:03] being married
[39:06] that's the norm
[39:11] and with marriage they're looking for
[39:14] a life after
[39:16] marriage
[39:21] now here it we're talking
[39:24] I guess we getting some Echo back we're
[39:27] talking about the marriage of the Lamb
[39:31] we're talking about
[39:33] the wife has made herself ready
[39:38] but are you ready to be married
[39:41] the preparations
[39:43] sometimes I look back and
[39:46] my life and sometimes
[39:48] I knew that
[39:50] at an early age
[39:52] sometimes I you felt like yeah I want to
[39:55] be married
[39:56] but was I ready to be married
[40:00] somebody says well bro
[40:02] a young man I want to introduce you to
[40:04] my daughter a young man I want to
[40:06] introduce you to this one on the job
[40:09] everybody wants to introduce you to
[40:11] somebody
[40:12] but you got to know whether or not
[40:13] you're ready
[40:17] even though there was a desire to be
[40:20] married
[40:22] but whether you're ready for marriage
[40:26] the church that we came up in
[40:29] they had to
[40:31] future homes or something like that
[40:34] and they prepared
[40:36] the young girls young ladies
[40:41] they tried to prepare them for marriage
[40:45] how to be
[40:48] even in school you had with the home
[40:51] economics or whatever
[40:53] they had things to try to get you ready
[40:57] for marriage
[40:59] so you were taught
[41:01] how to do certain dishes cook
[41:06] then you're supposed to be taught how to
[41:09] clean
[41:12] how to sew
[41:18] and what was expected of you
[41:21] as a wife
[41:25] sometimes
[41:27] we come from all walks of life
[41:31] sometimes there were single parents
[41:36] sometimes there's no father figure
[41:40] so young man
[41:42] and marriage
[41:44] the future is
[41:46] what kind of father will I be
[41:50] what kind of mother will I be
[41:54] am I ready to be a mother
[41:57] am I ready to be a father
[42:02] so I must position myself
[42:05] and I got to see whether or not I'm
[42:07] ready for marriage
[42:10] but many times our attention
[42:14] on whether we're ready to be married
[42:16] most of the time our
[42:19] I find many times we are trying to get
[42:23] the image of marriage to set upon my
[42:25] wedding day
[42:28] the wedding day is all about marriage
[42:31] how I want to look what kind of dress
[42:32] I'm gonna wear and uh you know who I
[42:36] want to be in my wedding and I will all
[42:39] that preparation
[42:42] but am I prepared for marriage have I
[42:45] made ready for it
[42:47] Jesus said concerning his wife he told
[42:52] her
[42:52] that I'm gonna make preparation I'm
[42:54] going to prepare a place for you
[42:58] are you with me
[43:00] so I'm talking to you this morning but
[43:04] I was just praying
[43:06] about it oh I want to bring certain
[43:09] principles out
[43:12] you know marriage is also
[43:16] you got to look at who you're going to
[43:18] marry
[43:21] and are y'all compatible
[43:26] the Bible speaks and says
[43:29] be not unequally yoked
[43:34] is your yoke equal
[43:38] am I prepared in everywhere
[43:42] be not unequily yoked together with
[43:45] unbelievables
[43:47] in other words do you have the same
[43:50] purpose same mind
[43:55] probably God's talks about an invisible
[43:57] Union
[44:00] he also speaks of children abroad
[44:05] that invisible Union
[44:10] should take place in spirit form
[44:15] sometimes I was looking by consciousness
[44:20] do you choose the bride or does God
[44:22] choose you a bride
[44:27] so you can choose who you want
[44:31] but God
[44:34] chooses for you
[44:37] when God makes the choice
[44:40] it's different
[44:42] when you make the choice you're going to
[44:44] come into some pitfalls and some hard
[44:46] things that you're going to have to go
[44:48] through
[44:49] but when God chooses for you
[44:52] then he don't make a mistake
[44:57] many people have made choices for us
[45:03] but the choice that God makes
[45:06] that's that makes a difference
[45:09] are you with me
[45:11] now God doesn't doesn't make a mistake
[45:16] are you ready for marriage do you
[45:18] qualify
[45:20] what are your qualifications
[45:25] most of the time
[45:29] all we are looking for is the outward
[45:31] appearance
[45:36] is to fulfill our
[45:38] lust
[45:41] we're not looking for
[45:44] compatibility
[45:47] character
[45:50] we're looking for substance someone that
[45:55] can
[45:56] nurture
[45:58] because if you look forward to
[46:01] Eve was to reproduce Adam
[46:07] the product of
[46:10] What comes forth and who those
[46:12] individuals are
[46:16] the Bible said train up a child and
[46:18] where it should go and when his old
[46:20] won't depart
[46:24] do we have
[46:26] that nurturing that is needed
[46:31] can we provide
[46:33] that type of character are we just going
[46:36] to have a child and have children
[46:41] and don't know how to manage
[46:46] we can't manage ourselves we can't
[46:48] manage them we can't manage we will
[46:53] you know I want to use the word
[46:54] oblivious
[46:59] we just lost
[47:02] when uh a state of
[47:06] what did I just do
[47:09] but yet we want to be grown we want to
[47:11] be
[47:13] um strong we want to be I am a dog I am
[47:20] I am smart I'm intelligent I'm this all
[47:24] of that don't mean a thing
[47:29] the fruits of your label
[47:32] what are you going to produce
[47:37] sometimes a responsibility
[47:40] the lies within
[47:42] am I ready to be married
[47:46] sometimes if you really examine it you
[47:49] you're thoroughly hell no
[47:53] I don't know about that
[47:56] I'm not really really are you ready to
[47:59] take on the responsibilities
[48:04] are you ready to
[48:07] give up because marriage is no more
[48:11] Twain the two becoming
[48:15] to becoming one
[48:17] let me
[48:19] just go through a scripture two because
[48:21] we're living in an age of Chaos
[48:26] the churches are getting all confused
[48:28] the preachers are getting confused
[48:31] that used to understand
[48:33] separate principles
[48:35] I'm just going to read these scriptures
[48:37] because
[48:39] I want to set a little foundation around
[48:41] that because of what's going on
[48:48] around us and our environment
[48:53] sometimes the passages look like they've
[48:55] gotten a state of Amnesia confusion
[48:59] but the word of God
[49:01] it's the same
[49:04] the word of God is the same as it ever
[49:06] was
[49:07] what's written in this Bible is the same
[49:11] same Bible
[49:13] same truth
[49:15] it says here
[49:17] and uh Matthew 19 and 4.
[49:22] and he answered the Pharisees talking
[49:24] about my
[49:26] is it lawful to put away your wife and
[49:28] he answered and said unto them have you
[49:31] not read
[49:32] that he which made them at at the
[49:35] beginning made them what
[49:38] so don't worry about
[49:40] was a this woman with woman a man with
[49:44] man no made him what
[49:46] male and female so don't worry about
[49:48] that we're not dealing with that this
[49:50] morning
[49:51] made a male and female isn't that right
[49:54] and he said
[49:55] but it's called shall a man what
[50:00] and we'll live in we'll we're talking
[50:02] about
[50:05] my parents with David and Charlotte
[50:07] Simmons
[50:10] are you with me
[50:13] and if I'm going to be married to Christ
[50:16] then it's not denying David and
[50:19] Charlotte Simmons but I got to leave my
[50:23] natural birth which was a sinful birth
[50:26] are you with me
[50:28] I was born in sin shaping and iniquity
[50:33] so I got to in order to be married to
[50:36] Christ I got to leave that
[50:41] are you with me
[50:42] I can't be my are you married to Christ
[50:45] and still holding on to that damn it
[50:48] nature
[50:51] are you with me
[50:54] I'm getting ahead of myself but
[50:56] hopefully you understand leave your
[50:58] father and the mother shall cleave to
[51:01] his wife why
[51:03] and they twain shall be what
[51:05] one flesh
[51:08] the Bible teaches us by one Spirit or we
[51:11] baptize into what
[51:13] one body God is calling for a union a
[51:16] union with him
[51:18] are you ready to be United with Jesus
[51:21] Christ are you ready to be married
[51:25] the union with Christ is different
[51:31] in your union what Christ ought to be
[51:34] so
[51:36] that you can look at your union with
[51:38] Christ and your union in the natural
[51:40] marriage look at your union in the
[51:43] spiritual marriage
[51:45] okay because here it talks about
[51:49] his wife has made herself ready
[51:55] okay he said well for
[51:57] there are no more Twain but they're one
[52:00] flesh
[52:03] what therefore God has joined together
[52:06] let not what
[52:09] let no man put a son
[52:12] so I said this is an invisible Union
[52:14] here that you've been coming one in
[52:17] Christ
[52:19] he said your normal Twain you know more
[52:22] chew but you're one
[52:26] are you with me
[52:27] he said this is a great mystery but I
[52:30] speak concerning Christ in the church
[52:34] amen you are married amen and it's wife
[52:38] has made herself ready
[52:42] I was telling Caleb and I say your power
[52:46] of your Victory is in your prayers
[52:51] you must overcome in your prayers and
[52:54] get Victory through praying
[52:57] and when you pray through amen you can
[53:00] make it through
[53:02] When you pray and you know that your
[53:04] prayers have been heard and God has
[53:06] conquered your enemy
[53:13] a lot of times the lack of prayer crying
[53:16] out the god in desperation amen when you
[53:20] get detriment enough that God I need
[53:22] Deliverance
[53:24] I need your power
[53:27] God I can't make it without you
[53:31] get desperate
[53:34] concerning our faith in him
[53:37] are you ready to be married he said for
[53:41] the marriage of the Lamb has come
[53:44] and his wife has made herself ready
[53:49] are you with me
[53:52] so in Simplicity here
[53:54] uh
[53:59] as we read let not man put us on and
[54:02] they said unto him why didn't Moses then
[54:05] command to give a right and a divorce
[54:08] and then to put it away he said unto
[54:10] them Moses because of the what
[54:13] hardness of your heart
[54:16] because of the hardness of your heart
[54:19] suffered you to put away your wives
[54:22] right
[54:24] he suffered you because your heart was
[54:26] hard to put away
[54:29] he said but from the beginning it was
[54:32] what
[54:33] is not so amen
[54:36] so it wasn't so
[54:39] he said and I say unto you
[54:41] whosoever shall put away his wife except
[54:45] it be for what
[54:47] fornication
[54:49] the angel told uh Joseph in the dream
[54:52] fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife
[54:56] he was engaged to her
[54:59] but he said fear not to take him to thee
[55:01] Mary thy wife for that which is conceded
[55:03] here is of the Holy Ghost
[55:06] amen
[55:08] when he wanted to put a wave because he
[55:11] hadn't married her yet he was engaged
[55:14] but he said this is your wife
[55:17] and I'm saying you were married to Jesus
[55:19] Christ right now he's your husband
[55:22] are you with me
[55:25] it is already you've already made God
[55:27] decision
[55:28] you've already said I will I do
[55:33] are you a man
[55:37] so in that you have said that I made a
[55:40] commitment to Christ I said Lord I
[55:42] accept you as my Lord and my savior then
[55:45] you are my husband
[55:51] are you with me and I invite your Holy
[55:54] Ghost I invite your Holy Spirit in
[55:58] I want you to be welcome to come into my
[56:01] life
[56:01] so Holy Ghost come on
[56:06] I said I do I will
[56:09] I said I I I I want you to be my Lord my
[56:13] savior
[56:14] but I want you to know it wasn't your
[56:16] choice
[56:18] it wasn't you'd have made that decision
[56:20] it was God that gave you that heart that
[56:23] mind and that will and that Walton
[56:28] amen because he chose you you were
[56:30] willing to accept
[56:33] that little noise that little push that
[56:36] little thing that said do it
[56:41] something said it's for me in Christ and
[56:44] my savior he died for my sins I need my
[56:48] Lord and I want to accept him
[56:51] something inside you begin to
[56:53] believe that
[56:55] doesn't matter what Mama believed her
[56:57] daddy believe her sister brother it
[56:59] doesn't matter what friends believe
[57:00] something inside of me saying yes
[57:03] I believe
[57:06] praise God
[57:08] and what made you qualified to be the
[57:11] Lamb's wife
[57:13] amen why would you become under the
[57:17] qualification how do you fit that moles
[57:21] because the Lamb's wife is supposed to
[57:23] be his church his bride
[57:25] which is his body isn't that right
[57:29] the Bible said that he in order to marry
[57:33] him we we must be a church with our spot
[57:36] or without blemish amen
[57:40] without wrinkle or any such thing isn't
[57:44] that right
[57:45] so what makes you that way
[57:54] for his wife has made herself ready
[57:58] amen
[58:00] so what makes you so clean and so pure
[58:03] and so right inside of God that you can
[58:07] say that I'm Justified and I'm equally
[58:09] young and I can be one what makes you
[58:13] that way
[58:16] saying You must be perfect to marry
[58:19] perfection
[58:23] for he said be ye perfect as your father
[58:25] which is in heaven is perfect
[58:28] if I'm going to marry Jesus Christ then
[58:30] I as an individual must be perfect and
[58:33] how can I be perfect when I'm born in
[58:35] sin shaping in iniquity how can that
[58:37] happen
[58:39] with God's God is looking for perfection
[58:42] without blemish without spot
[58:47] are you with me so how am I going to
[58:51] reach that particular how can he marry
[58:53] me a sinner
[58:54] a ratchet undone
[59:00] he said unto her was granted that she be
[59:04] arrayed and white linen
[59:09] amen
[59:11] it's going to be pure it's going to be
[59:13] white
[59:14] amen
[59:17] God is is granting you something he's
[59:20] given you that garment to be dressed to
[59:23] him
[59:25] and I believe that
[59:28] the Bible says
[59:31] he made himself
[59:33] sin
[59:35] that you might be clothed
[59:39] amen that you might be clothed with his
[59:42] righteousness
[59:44] are you with me
[59:46] see the lamb in the Old Testament amen
[59:51] when the lamb was without spot and it
[59:53] was offered as a sacrifice for your sins
[59:56] in the Old Testament it can only cover
[59:58] up your sins
[1:00:02] it could not take away your sin because
[1:00:04] you had the same desires
[1:00:10] but you had a covering for sin because
[1:00:14] of the Lamb that was sad his blood for
[1:00:18] you in the Old Testament
[1:00:25] he said for the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:00:29] come and his wife has made herself ready
[1:00:35] so actually you're looking at the lamb
[1:00:40] praise God if the lamb in the Old
[1:00:44] Testament could cover how much more the
[1:00:47] lamb that was without spot without the
[1:00:50] limits
[1:00:52] are you with me
[1:00:54] the lamb that does not spot without the
[1:00:57] limits shattered his blood
[1:01:01] that you might be made the righteousness
[1:01:04] of God that he could take away every
[1:01:07] blemish of his spot
[1:01:09] never rank away from your life
[1:01:13] oh God
[1:01:16] amen is because you can be equally yoked
[1:01:21] you can be holy because I am Holy
[1:01:24] praise God how can you be holy it's
[1:01:27] because a holy God came praise God and
[1:01:30] Jesus was demanded
[1:01:33] amen he became the justifier
[1:01:38] he justified us
[1:01:41] amen by his own blood
[1:01:44] are you with me
[1:01:47] so
[1:01:49] for fornication that's before you get
[1:01:51] married
[1:01:52] committed the door to whosoever uh
[1:01:55] married her that's put away committed
[1:01:57] adultery isn't that right
[1:01:59] a mark 10 and 5.
[1:02:05] I know I'm getting over some some things
[1:02:08] giving you a lot of information Mark 10
[1:02:11] and 5. God is good amen
[1:02:14] don't go around and I hear make a
[1:02:17] mistake
[1:02:19] and then you got to deal with it the
[1:02:20] rest of your life
[1:02:23] are you with me
[1:02:26] there's no excuse
[1:02:29] I don't know what the preacher's
[1:02:30] preaching and teaching but the Bible
[1:02:33] says in the days of Noah there was
[1:02:34] marriage and giving in marriage
[1:02:39] I know God no hadn't changed his mind
[1:02:41] about his word
[1:02:44] I know Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:02:45] and the daily forever
[1:02:48] I don't know what they're teaching out
[1:02:50] there
[1:02:51] and what they're preaching and what they
[1:02:52] believe in
[1:02:53] but I know whose report I believe
[1:02:57] I believe what the word said
[1:02:59] are you with me are you believing what
[1:03:02] the Bible say
[1:03:03] I don't care how great or how eloquent
[1:03:06] some preacher can tell you something
[1:03:08] believe what the word says
[1:03:12] God is hidden in his own word
[1:03:14] he's there
[1:03:17] no confusion
[1:03:18] Mark 10 and 5.
[1:03:21] and Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:03:23] them
[1:03:24] Moses gave him a bill and divorcement
[1:03:27] they said
[1:03:29] for the hardness of your heart he wrote
[1:03:33] you this precept
[1:03:35] but from the what
[1:03:37] from the beginning of creation
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:44] he made them male and female for this
[1:03:47] cause shall a man leave his father and
[1:03:49] mother and cleave into his wife
[1:03:52] and the twain shall be one flesh
[1:03:55] so then
[1:03:57] they are no more Twain but one flesh
[1:04:01] what therefore God has joined together
[1:04:03] let not what
[1:04:07] in the house
[1:04:09] his disciples asked him again of this
[1:04:13] matter
[1:04:14] I hope you asking him again in this
[1:04:16] matter
[1:04:19] let me see if he's going to say anything
[1:04:21] different
[1:04:23] we make it a little plainer
[1:04:25] in case you didn't understand it in
[1:04:26] Matthew let me make it a little plainer
[1:04:29] are you with me
[1:04:31] 11. and he said unto them whosoever
[1:04:36] shall put away his what
[1:04:38] wife and married or what
[1:04:42] committed adultery what
[1:04:45] okay the man can but the woman can
[1:04:53] the mankind but the woman can't
[1:04:58] who give him a right to say something
[1:05:00] different from what the Bible say
[1:05:03] who has a right to say something
[1:05:04] different than what the Bible Well ah an
[1:05:07] interpretation uh who has a right to
[1:05:10] interpret the word different
[1:05:13] God mean what he says it's plain isn't
[1:05:16] that right
[1:05:18] why are we why are we going to add an
[1:05:19] interpretation to that
[1:05:22] is that right
[1:05:24] we don't need no interpretation
[1:05:26] it's right there plane isn't that right
[1:05:29] let me read it again
[1:05:33] and he said unto them whosoever shall
[1:05:35] what
[1:05:37] put away his wife and what
[1:05:42] um
[1:05:43] committed what
[1:05:46] and if a woman shall what
[1:05:50] and be married to what
[1:05:53] she what
[1:05:55] the church might not get full up

[1:06:18] ain't nothing but you know what I'm
[1:06:20] saying
[1:06:22] people are afraid of the word
[1:06:26] they want to make excuse for doing what
[1:06:28] they want to do and then they want to
[1:06:30] blame brother Simmons for it
[1:06:34] are you up man
[1:06:36] don't blame me
[1:06:38] blame the word
[1:06:41] amen I'm just only saying what he said
[1:06:43] isn't that right well y'all believe bro
[1:06:46] oh it ain't nothing about me it's about
[1:06:49] the word

[1:06:53] he said
[1:06:55] he said so what I say
[1:06:57] I'm saying what he's saying
[1:07:00] the Bible
[1:07:04] let God be what
[1:07:06] let God Be True in there
[1:07:09] every man alive isn't that right
[1:07:12] but something oh Lord have mercy oh I
[1:07:16] don't want you to stand stand with the
[1:07:18] word don't worry about standing with me
[1:07:20] stand on your conviction if you don't
[1:07:23] believe it then that's up to you
[1:07:25] but I believe what the Bible say
[1:07:29] in Romans 7.

[1:07:34] you asked me why are you saying all
[1:07:35] these things brother Sim somebody might
[1:07:38] be getting ready to do something crazy

[1:08:21] how that
