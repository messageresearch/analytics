[29:12] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[29:14] Lord amen
[29:15] you have your Bibles turned with me to
[29:17] the Book of Matthew the 22nd chapter
[29:22] Matthew 22
[29:26] .
[29:28] and let's start at 34 through 40.
[29:36] Matthew 22 34.
[29:40] through 40.
[29:45] but when the Pharisees had heard that he
[29:49] had put the Sadducees
[29:51] to silence they were gathered together
[29:55] then one of them which was a lawyer
[29:58] asked him a question tempting him and
[30:02] saying master
[30:04] which is the great commandment in the
[30:07] law
[30:08] Jesus said unto him
[30:11] thou shall love the Lord thy God with
[30:14] all thy heart with all thy soul and with
[30:18] all thy mind
[30:19] this is the first and great commandment
[30:24] and the second light until it thou shall
[30:28] love thy neighbor as thyself
[30:31] on these two Commandments
[30:34] hang all the law in the prophets let us
[30:39] pray father
[30:40] we thank you God for your word tonight
[30:42] we ask you God to bless it in Jesus name
[30:45] amen have you seated
[30:48] I want to read another scripture you'll
[30:50] be seated and we'll come back here to
[30:52] Matthew uh go with me if you will to the
[30:54] book of um First Corinthians
[30:58] and I want to kind of just get this in
[31:00] before I
[31:03] go past it
[31:06] we were kind of using this back
[31:10] the other night in Marion and I just
[31:12] felt
[31:14] to let us share a little bit of it here
[31:17] by God's grace
[31:19] uh First Corinthians
[31:21] 13.
[31:24] 3-8
[31:27] never go back to Matthew 22.
[31:30] third verse Matthew excuse me
[31:33] First Corinthians 13 and 3. and though I
[31:37] bestow all my goods to feed the poor
[31:40] and though I give my body to be burned
[31:43] and have not charity it profited me
[31:47] nothing
[31:48] charity suffereth long in his kind
[31:52] charity intervieweth not charity borneth
[31:58] not itself is not puff up
[32:01] doeth not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[32:05] not her own
[32:07] is not easily provoked
[32:09] thank no evil Rejoice not in iniquity
[32:13] but rejoice in the truth
[32:16] all things believeth all things hope all
[32:20] things endureth all things
[32:22] charity never failing but whether there
[32:27] be prophecies they shall fail
[32:30] whether there'll be tongues they shall
[32:32] cease
[32:33] whether there be knowledge it shall
[32:36] vanish away
[32:38] amen
[32:40] let's go back to the Book of Matthew 20
[32:45] 22
[32:46] I kind of want to use for a little
[32:49] thought tonight and something that we
[32:52] was kind of working with
[32:54] the other night at Marion
[32:58] and I entitled it
[33:02] A Love Affair
[33:05] a love of fear
[33:08] I like the way that
[33:11] Jesus
[33:13] described this and we know the different
[33:15] type of Love Philo in our God play
[33:19] and no matter who you meet these days if
[33:21] you ask people do they love God they say
[33:24] I love God
[33:26] well we know Jesus said if you love me
[33:28] then you'll keep my Commandments
[33:31] another place Jesus was telling the
[33:34] people because and I think very much
[33:37] parallel to this generation he said you
[33:41] love me with your mouth but your heart
[33:43] is far from me
[33:46] and that is so true in this hour
[33:49] especially when it comes to the
[33:50] religious Realm
[33:52] uh because everybody just believed
[33:56] because they know that they ought to
[33:59] love everybody
[34:02] but to really possess it
[34:05] is another thing
[34:08] uh because God love is not partial
[34:14] I like your highest describe it there
[34:16] you know First Corinthians 13 He said
[34:19] God love charity is it envious
[34:23] it's long it's enduring see uh it's not
[34:28] something you put on today and then
[34:30] tomorrow is gone
[34:33] like a many even I've been saying the
[34:36] other night you know that uh because we
[34:39] know that the word love is has been
[34:41] expressed uh in our terminology that you
[34:46] know that we love you we love you we
[34:49] love you but I believe the love that God
[34:52] really is talking about and it's
[34:55] something even when the prophet of God
[34:57] went over the other side he said nothing
[34:59] going to enter there but perfect love
[35:04] he didn't say none of the Mysteries
[35:07] he said number to deeply but he said
[35:09] nothing but perfect love
[35:12] we're into there it's not your knowledge
[35:15] are your gifts
[35:18] no matter how much money you give to the
[35:21] church give your body to be burned
[35:24] he said if charity no dare it Prophet
[35:27] should nothing
[35:28] so above anything that you can give or
[35:32] do
[35:33] which is good to do those things I
[35:35] believe out of the abundance of your
[35:37] heart if it's real love you will do
[35:40] these things
[35:41] but then because we're living in the end
[35:43] of impersonation
[35:46] and people can impersonate that they do
[35:50] this or to do that you see what I do but
[35:53] yet in the heart
[35:55] they can still not have the love of God
[35:57] there
[35:59] could people do things uh because of a
[36:03] reason
[36:04] I wrote down something I say you know uh
[36:07] fetal love is a flesh they love and that
[36:10] love we do things for people because of
[36:14] because you my cousin because you were
[36:18] this because but God love doesn't in
[36:21] spite of
[36:23] in spite of what we did God yet gave his
[36:27] life for us
[36:29] in spite of what we were and and how we
[36:33] were living yet God knew
[36:36] and his love was so genuine that he
[36:39] wasn't worried about what state we were
[36:42] in
[36:43] he had a bigger picture
[36:47] so he gave his life the Bible said for
[36:50] God so loved the world
[36:54] when he gave his life not just uh 20 uh
[36:58] 20 or whatever no before the foundation
[37:01] of the world
[37:04] the whole act God did it was because of
[37:07] the love
[37:09] that he had for us because we were lost
[37:15] we've lost total Fellowship
[37:19] we were uh away from God
[37:24] no way back
[37:26] but God grace in Mercy Made A Way
[37:31] to reconcile us back to him again
[37:36] that's why I'm understanding uh you know
[37:39] I thought that the servant of God said
[37:41] he said you know we ought to be the most
[37:44] happiest people there is on the Earth
[37:47] why but because of of of what he did for
[37:52] us
[37:54] and what it cost him he did it something
[37:58] that no other man would do
[38:00] and can do
[38:03] and you know he didn't send Angel to do
[38:05] it
[38:06] he came himself
[38:09] wrapped in a body
[38:11] to walk
[38:13] on the earth in the flesh
[38:16] to be tilted to be hated to be spit on
[38:21] to be ridiculed to be talked about to be
[38:26] called a devil
[38:28] oh my
[38:30] God and we worry sometimes that our
[38:32] little like persecution
[38:37] and we can't hardly take it but he took
[38:40] it
[38:42] and he didn't have to but because of the
[38:45] love that he had even for his own
[38:48] enemies
[38:52] but his Pharisee the religious people
[38:56] came to him tempted him you know just uh
[39:00] see what he gonna say to try to
[39:03] catch him in some type of a commandment
[39:07] you know that wasn't written but I like
[39:10] the way Jesus always referred them back
[39:13] to the scripture
[39:16] and they said what is the greatest
[39:18] commandment
[39:19] you know I thought about I said you know
[39:21] he could have said a lot of things are
[39:24] concerning the law and uh you know the
[39:26] the Commandments and all but he said the
[39:29] greatest of all
[39:31] he said the love the Lord God with all
[39:35] thy heart all thy mind see in other
[39:39] words to give God every fiber of you
[39:45] that's what he did
[39:47] you know parallel he was saying
[39:49] Ephesians and I'm not going to turn down
[39:51] five he said husband love your wife
[39:56] as Christ loved the church that this is
[40:00] a great mystery but I'm speaking unto
[40:02] the church
[40:04] so God is expecting the church his
[40:07] church now
[40:09] to be wrapped up in a love that's
[40:13] unconditional
[40:16] regardless of what goes on or regardless
[40:20] of what happens tomorrow I'll be with
[40:22] Paul saying what shall separate us from
[40:25] the love of God
[40:30] what will separate you from the love of
[40:33] God
[40:34] she had trials to persecution he said
[40:37] name all these things we're more than
[40:40] conquerors
[40:42] see love love conquers
[40:47] every situation
[40:50] if we really understood it and why
[40:54] things are gone along with to happen
[40:58] I was saying so many times that
[41:01] everything that I'm learning and I'm I'm
[41:03] reflecting back on things in my life
[41:06] that I'm seeing now coming back over a
[41:09] lot of things that I dealt with and had
[41:12] uh went through in life and I look at it
[41:15] now and I said you know God was using
[41:17] this just to prepare you
[41:21] just to prepare you for what he really
[41:23] wants you to do
[41:26] everything that happens in our life
[41:28] there's a purpose
[41:31] see we look at all they do no no no no
[41:33] no no
[41:34] I'll be I heard somebody saying God even
[41:37] gotten the devil working for you
[41:40] what is he doing he is bringing you to a
[41:44] place of perfection
[41:47] he's building a character now a Godly
[41:51] character
[41:52] how does he do it through suffering
[41:57] and that's something we don't like to do
[42:01] suffer
[42:03] we want to be always on the Mountaintop
[42:06] the sister and brother there's some days
[42:08] you're going to be in the valley
[42:11] but even in the valley you can still see
[42:14] God
[42:17] I like that's on this thing sometimes
[42:19] then he could have Let Me Drown
[42:22] yes sir he he can let us just you know
[42:26] but no God that's why I said is uh God
[42:30] knows exactly how big brother said he
[42:32] put no more on you than you can bear
[42:36] I know we think we can't have a bell and
[42:39] sometimes those things be really
[42:41] strenuous but we did at those times we
[42:45] must trust that God got it all under
[42:48] control
[42:51] how we don't know but God I'm going to
[42:54] trust them
[42:56] that God sees everything
[43:00] every move that we make
[43:03] he knows everything that's going on in
[43:05] our life even right now but God said do
[43:09] you trust me
[43:11] in other words do you believe that I
[43:14] just didn't save you the illusion
[43:20] I believe one place the scripture is
[43:21] said that I have engraved you
[43:25] in the palm of my hand amen
[43:29] you in the palm of God Hand and the
[43:33] devil can't do you no harm but the
[43:35] children to sing that song Amen
[43:38] yes he got you in the palm of his hand
[43:40] and you might wonder and you might fret
[43:44] but let me tell you something God is in
[43:46] through with us yet
[43:50] but I understand this that
[43:54] what are the reasons that people uh get
[43:58] discouraged and about what's going on in
[44:02] their life uh and they make uh bad
[44:06] choices of this
[44:09] um not want to serve God on anymore a
[44:13] day uh feel that God did them wrong it's
[44:16] because they did love for God Isn't in
[44:19] the right place
[44:24] I type it out a lot of times that
[44:27] man never really love his wife he don't
[44:30] want to do nothing to just please her
[44:32] other herder
[44:35] he understand that the vows that they
[44:38] made was to death
[44:40] do they part
[44:43] and one of the reason that they're vile
[44:46] they begin to repeat those vows do you
[44:49] Jeremiah take this woman
[44:52] then they go over there saying for
[44:55] health
[44:56] of sickness for better
[44:58] or worse for richer are poor see
[45:03] their stipulation and letting us know
[45:06] you're gonna have these times
[45:09] that they will get a little rough
[45:12] but if it's real love you begin to bind
[45:15] yourself closer to more
[45:20] the little spats and a little
[45:22] disagreements you know just the other
[45:25] day you know I've had our 33rd
[45:27] anniversary uh whatnot you know you look
[45:30] back over the years and look back from
[45:32] where you started from where you at now
[45:36] and I can also see it with a true heart
[45:38] you know I love her more now than I did
[45:40] back then
[45:42] because you don't grow and went through
[45:44] some times that where you understand no
[45:47] matter what you went through you stayed
[45:49] together
[45:51] it takes a coward to run out
[45:55] but it takes two people that really love
[45:57] God they're going to trust God
[45:59] regardless of
[46:01] regardless of how it is I'm going to
[46:04] stay under the blood of the children
[46:07] I'm going to stay under the love and
[46:09] protection of God
[46:12] see but too many times many people will
[46:15] run away
[46:17] I believe it was said in the uh uh in
[46:20] the church ages the Ephesus it says that
[46:23] uh one of the complaints about them that
[46:26] they left their first love
[46:29] what was their first love it was the
[46:31] word
[46:33] it was God first
[46:36] I believe that's what what I would first
[46:39] think we started out on fire
[46:42] you man couldn't wait
[46:45] as David said I was glad when they said
[46:48] unto me let us go into the house of the
[46:51] Lord
[46:52] we were glad to be able to be one in the
[46:56] number one more time
[46:58] we went down when I messed up because we
[47:01] scared that that is something God was
[47:03] going to do Supernatural
[47:06] fire in the love of God that was burning
[47:09] in our hearts you couldn't keep you from
[47:12] the Church of God
[47:15] but after a while things happen
[47:19] I believe Paul said wouldn't believe he
[47:21] said you did run well but what hindia
[47:24] and the servant of God said what
[47:26] happened what he said the cares of this
[47:28] life
[47:31] begin to choke
[47:34] the love of God out of us
[47:38] the cares of this world begin to give us
[47:42] a more materialistic things that we can
[47:46] gain
[47:48] amen and before we know it it happened
[47:51] to all of us but little by little it
[47:53] crept in
[47:55] now we got much much much much much more
[47:59] than we ever had our whole life
[48:02] but look at them spiritual
[48:06] um
[48:07] can't even hardly get a prayer through
[48:12] hard
[48:14] to get their people everywhere
[48:18] it's hard to get the people back
[48:21] you know to the place that where they
[48:23] love God more than they love anything
[48:27] brother you have the the big bucks on a
[48:30] fine cars or the fine house it doesn't
[48:32] matter
[48:34] because you understand those things are
[48:36] temporal
[48:37] don't get me wrong I believe it God
[48:39] bless you thank God for it
[48:42] and I believe you do right by God God
[48:44] will bless you
[48:46] but I'm not so hyped up on me because
[48:49] what I got here I need something up
[48:52] there
[48:54] I mean brother Jared made that song you
[48:56] know how I want to go down there I want
[48:58] to go up here
[49:00] he's still working on that record I
[49:02] believe
[49:04] his first song he made
[49:07] I don't want to go down there but I why
[49:09] because a little boy he knew there was
[49:11] something up there
[49:13] see now he probably can look at it and
[49:15] say Lord have mercy I got to go up there
[49:18] now
[49:19] because down here enough but chaos
[49:24] look what we got to do and look what we
[49:26] got to deal with
[49:28] every day of our life
[49:30] there's a battle
[49:33] the battle going on the demon power is a
[49:37] pressing us
[49:38] attacking our mind sucking the very life
[49:42] of God out of us
[49:44] making us get too comfortable here
[49:48] and making us think God don't care
[49:49] anymore
[49:52] I mean the Bible said what a place that
[49:54] because the Lord the lady is coming
[49:57] old thing continue
[50:00] as they were people now going backwards
[50:04] you know oh it's been a long time
[50:07] you know some even doubting whether the
[50:09] Lord is going to come
[50:12] in other words they'll die I say dollar
[50:14] because then let me tell you something
[50:15] if we really believe and understood you
[50:19] know or that is later that we think we
[50:22] be packing up ready to get out of here
[50:26] we'll be doing everything right now I
[50:30] could do I know how to do Lord I want to
[50:33] be ready
[50:36] I read the Bible saying Revelation said
[50:38] that his bride had made
[50:41] herself ready
[50:43] in other words each and every one of us
[50:46] you got to make yourself High
[50:49] by the word
[50:52] the very purpose God sent us this word
[50:55] in this hour was to give us the thing to
[50:59] prepare us
[51:01] for his second coming amen the word of
[51:04] God prepare us
[51:07] is coming
[51:12] I like it too because
[51:14] I thought about you know of many of the
[51:16] things that Jesus could have said to
[51:18] them
[51:20] you know in other words
[51:22] what will be the greatest thing
[51:26] in this hour
[51:28] what is what would be the greatest
[51:30] commandment of this hour
[51:33] what would be the main screen line of of
[51:37] uh us preparing ourself you know for God
[51:41] in this hour I'll be the servant of God
[51:43] so one of the initiative evidence of the
[51:45] Holy Ghost that is love
[51:48] event
[51:50] I want to read something
[51:53] another scripture
[51:56] find it Matthew 5.
[52:02] the love of God
[52:05] should have brought in our hearts by the
[52:07] Holy Ghost
[52:08] I'm in Real Love Now not this stuff that
[52:11] people talking about
[52:14] um I love you today but come Monday I
[52:16] ain't like you anymore
[52:19] you know or we love people one of the
[52:22] saddest one of the saddest things that
[52:25] I've seen in lately
[52:29] is that uh people have this thing that
[52:33] they only love them those that in their
[52:37] Church they can't love outside
[52:41] the owner can love amongst these walls
[52:43] they can't love nobody out there because
[52:45] they ain't like us
[52:48] what does that
[52:49] does that mean like you
[52:51] you know in other words that uh as long
[52:55] as you're with me I love you
[52:57] but if you decided to go somewhere else
[53:00] and then I don't love you like that
[53:02] because you ain't identified with us
[53:06] come on is that what Jesus did
[53:09] I believe he went outside his box
[53:14] he went even out sometime he had to even
[53:16] send his own disciples somewhere else to
[53:19] go talk to this lady who had five
[53:22] husbands
[53:24] because they wouldn't understood the
[53:27] love that he had for the lowest of the
[53:30] lowest sea he never tried Somebody went
[53:33] to the news the church folks they just
[53:36] heard about Jesus but he went to know
[53:38] them without
[53:41] oh without the message of the hour
[53:46] he went to those who didn't even know
[53:48] nothing about
[53:50] um a prophetic Ministry
[53:53] if you know he went he went to them in
[53:57] that state and he wanted to try to help
[54:00] them to lift them up
[54:03] what did he presented to them he gave
[54:06] them the word
[54:08] because he was a Living Word
[54:11] see he knew what he had he knew what
[54:13] they needed
[54:15] and the people needed the word of God to
[54:19] get him out of this condition
[54:21] and that's what it gonna take Sinister
[54:23] it's not the Deep things that we're
[54:26] trying to get the people to see give him
[54:29] Jesus
[54:33] and he is the word
[54:35] amen
[54:37] but we're trying to be mystified
[54:41] you know we're trying to be intellectual
[54:44] Giants
[54:46] and we missing the little sheeps and the
[54:49] little lambs
[54:52] oh yeah we're getting the up any luck
[54:55] but we missing the real sheep see
[54:59] because Jesus said my sheep will hear my
[55:03] voice in a stranger they don't want to
[55:06] hear they won't hear
[55:08] so he's looking for sheeps
[55:11] it seems are vulnerable they did they
[55:14] have to have a leader
[55:20] they're easily to be persuaded without a
[55:23] shepherd
[55:26] that's why Jesus Christ is the bishop
[55:28] and The Shepherd of our soul
[55:32] it can't be that uh I believe you know
[55:35] that God uses vessels
[55:40] to deal with people
[55:43] but it's not so much the main figure
[55:46] it's the spirit of God in him
[55:50] and he understand that it takes a wise
[55:53] man to win souls
[55:56] see one planet one water God give the
[56:00] increase
[56:03] the people you may be talking to right
[56:05] now may not come but if they are
[56:08] predestined to see the god they'll fell
[56:12] up somewhere down the line
[56:14] I believe that
[56:17] you all know that we're really gleaning
[56:19] the fields now
[56:22] very hard very difficult very in a
[56:27] religious country as we're living in
[56:30] that everybody now got it
[56:35] and they just satisfied that I have
[56:38] arrived we have around that
[56:41] and even sometime even amongst people
[56:45] because they've heard a cried because
[56:48] they have heard to come out of her my
[56:51] people
[56:52] they can get satisfied
[56:56] but let me tell you something until
[56:58] Jesus come don't you get satisfied
[57:02] you can never get all that God has for
[57:06] you
[57:07] because there's just so much that God
[57:09] wants to bring to us
[57:12] I believe I like that story he said
[57:14] Falling In Love With Jesus
[57:17] it's the best thing I ever did
[57:21] falling in love again
[57:24] that's what I believe not following you
[57:27] well someone with the trip because it
[57:29] it's going to take the love of God to
[57:31] keep us in this hour
[57:34] because we're going to face obstacles
[57:37] you're gonna face some hardships and
[57:40] some hard things but yet and all of that
[57:42] Lord I know you love me
[57:46] you better understand everything now but
[57:48] something you understand it better by
[57:50] and by
[57:52] when the morning come
[57:55] let's go to Matthew 5.
[58:02] 43-46.
[58:06] he said you have heard
[58:09] that it has been said
[58:11] thou shall love thy neighbor and hate
[58:14] thy enemy
[58:16] but I say unto you love your enemies
[58:21] bless them that curse you
[58:23] do good to them that hate you and pray
[58:27] for them which despitefully use you and
[58:31] persecute you
[58:33] that ye may be the children of your
[58:35] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[58:39] the son to rise on the evil and on the
[58:43] good
[58:44] instead of rain on the just and on the
[58:48] unjust
[58:49] but if you love them which love you what
[58:53] reward have ye do not even the publicans
[58:57] the same
[58:59] in other words you know he said you know
[59:01] we love them that do good to us and we
[59:04] want to get do something good for them
[59:06] but how about the one that don't like
[59:08] you
[59:10] the one that despitefully talk about you
[59:13] scandalize you
[59:15] do you love them
[59:19] see it's easy to love them they love you
[59:22] and sometimes the one we think love us
[59:25] don't love us
[59:27] they love what you can do for them
[59:30] or what they can get from you
[59:33] see what the love you in spite of what
[59:36] you're dealing with are going through my
[59:38] love hasn't changed that's real love
[59:43] what makes a man want to run out on his
[59:46] wife his love isn't right
[59:50] his love is not for in his heart he
[59:52] don't really love her
[59:54] because he love her like God wants her
[59:57] to you want to do nothing
[1:00:00] to hurt
[1:00:02] your wife
[1:00:04] and the church won't do nothing to hurt
[1:00:06] God don't worry about hurting the church
[1:00:10] but you're sitting against God
[1:00:13] you don't want to bring no bad reproach
[1:00:16] upon the word because you love him
[1:00:21] see it I I love him that much the Lord
[1:00:24] whatever I need to do even I make a
[1:00:26] mistake Lord let me get it right
[1:00:31] see if love is corrective
[1:00:35] if you don't like to be corrected then
[1:00:37] you don't love the person
[1:00:39] you let those children do anything let
[1:00:42] everybody do anything it's all right no
[1:00:46] Your Love ain't right for that child
[1:00:49] so to have to correct the children they
[1:00:52] don't like you sometimes but they're
[1:00:54] understanding and it did me good
[1:00:58] look back in the days what we thought
[1:01:00] was hard no it might be even hard but
[1:01:03] what the world got out there
[1:01:06] oh my Lord
[1:01:08] let me tell you something the devil's
[1:01:10] not playing
[1:01:12] and he don't patch you either but I've
[1:01:15] been about to say the way of a
[1:01:16] transgressor is hard
[1:01:20] they always say if you make your bed
[1:01:22] harder you're gonna have to lay in it
[1:01:25] and there are some things that I've done
[1:01:27] in my life I wish I never would have did
[1:01:30] but because of not listening properly I
[1:01:33] had to suffer
[1:01:36] and it leaves some imprint on you to the
[1:01:39] rest of your life you always look about
[1:01:41] I wish I would I wish but that's water
[1:01:43] in the bridge
[1:01:45] what I'm gonna do with it now I'm gonna
[1:01:48] use it as a stuffing store I'm gonna
[1:01:50] learn from that
[1:01:51] and I'm going to tell my children I'm
[1:01:53] gonna tell somebody else don't go that
[1:01:55] way
[1:01:56] see your children young people the
[1:01:59] reason why we are telling you these
[1:02:00] things now because we know what road the
[1:02:04] devil has for you
[1:02:05] we'd have been down there and done those
[1:02:08] things it hasn't changed
[1:02:10] just a different little format
[1:02:13] you know now it does become a little
[1:02:16] more uh
[1:02:19] educational
[1:02:22] a way of doing the same evil
[1:02:27] putting good labels on evil doings
[1:02:32] of down there saying Tower letting the
[1:02:35] child uh decide what gender they are
[1:02:38] ain't that sick
[1:02:41] let them decide I also said the proof
[1:02:45] isn't important
[1:02:48] the evidence is they're already down
[1:02:51] you can say this and say that oh no no
[1:02:54] no you can't change that
[1:02:57] I don't care what you say happen oh I
[1:03:00] didn't mind this didn't happen that
[1:03:02] didn't happen still yet the proof
[1:03:06] the proof is right there
[1:03:09] can't be denied
[1:03:12] no matter what you say out of your mouth
[1:03:15] God didn't make no mistake when he made
[1:03:18] you
[1:03:19] he made you just like he made you
[1:03:23] you are what you are by the grace of God
[1:03:26] I don't care what Futures didn't maybe
[1:03:29] develop part and all of that that's all
[1:03:31] right you steal what what made you
[1:03:37] from the very beginning he made Adam and
[1:03:39] Eve
[1:03:42] he separated them
[1:03:45] he gave them a certain agenda
[1:03:48] in their bodies
[1:03:51] they were built a certain way
[1:03:54] they cannot erase that they couldn't
[1:03:56] change that
[1:03:58] but you see with the education of these
[1:04:00] trying to change the whole thing
[1:04:02] have a surgery to remove this and remove
[1:04:07] that
[1:04:08] oh my perversion
[1:04:12] see that's what the devil do but Jesus
[1:04:14] said he said
[1:04:15] uh you heard eye for eye
[1:04:18] in other words you do it to me I'ma Do
[1:04:20] it to you
[1:04:23] in other words I'm gonna get even with
[1:04:24] you
[1:04:26] no
[1:04:27] we don't do that as Christian but the
[1:04:30] love of God got to be like if you don't
[1:04:32] have it you'll be doing the eye for eye
[1:04:36] you know we do it in a little slick way
[1:04:40] you know
[1:04:42] very subtle not so much out out but
[1:04:47] cunningly
[1:04:49] to get them back
[1:04:52] but no leave that to God you just love
[1:04:56] them
[1:05:01] he said what this world really looking
[1:05:04] for is the love of God
[1:05:07] okay everybody just stay in love with
[1:05:09] their mouth everybody know them know
[1:05:11] it go beyond that I believe love has
[1:05:14] actions
[1:05:17] you know it's like uh people can love
[1:05:19] God on Sunday about Monday the love God
[1:05:22] gone
[1:05:24] ourselves in the barbershop
[1:05:26] then you are terribly upset
[1:05:31] but when you can get it you all cheers
[1:05:35] I believe this regardless of what we
[1:05:38] have to deal with and it's better said
[1:05:40] than done because we all have to deal
[1:05:43] with things in this life
[1:05:46] and sometimes it gets real home
[1:05:49] and God's going to allow it to come home
[1:05:52] to you
[1:05:53] because we got to be tried on what we
[1:05:56] say we got
[1:05:59] you're going to be proven to be one in a
[1:06:02] million
[1:06:04] oh you can't say no so I'm one in a
[1:06:06] million but we go to sleep
[1:06:09] could the testing time is going to come
[1:06:14] oh to all of us none of us can escape it
[1:06:19] that's why now we really need to get
[1:06:22] grounded and rooted in the love of God
[1:06:27] you know don't love people because if
[1:06:29] somebody else don't love them vice versa
[1:06:33] groups you know sometimes wanna you know
[1:06:36] don't love this one but love that one
[1:06:38] and that's partiality
[1:06:41] God in like that
[1:06:44] and you give to the door that can give
[1:06:45] back give them somebody that can't give
[1:06:47] back
[1:06:49] oh I ain't giving them
[1:06:53] I don't give them so much now they're
[1:06:55] like that's true
[1:06:57] but how do you know God in testing you
[1:07:01] I didn't say give him everything but
[1:07:03] you're gonna have some wisdom with
[1:07:04] because all the time it's not the
[1:07:06] material things you know I'm learning
[1:07:09] something this you can if if any parent
[1:07:12] just want to buy these children
[1:07:13] everything
[1:07:16] but I'm you trying to party love
[1:07:20] you can't buy they love
[1:07:24] see you got to show yourself respect but
[1:07:27] and they can feel that you love them
[1:07:33] or if you get the all these A's and
[1:07:35] nothing wrong with AIDS shall I like
[1:07:37] yeah that's good
[1:07:39] but they're still your child
[1:07:43] I'm learning parenting you have some
[1:07:46] children to do this to do that but
[1:07:48] regardless of at the end of it they
[1:07:50] steal your child
[1:07:54] and regardless of some of us that went
[1:07:56] way out the way but we still was God's
[1:07:59] child
[1:08:01] and God knew what it takes to reel us
[1:08:04] back
[1:08:06] why your love must be long
[1:08:12] sometime years
[1:08:15] one of the things I learned so much
[1:08:17] about the Simmons taught the word and
[1:08:20] talked to me a lot of times about a lot
[1:08:22] of things down and I've been wondering
[1:08:25] why he's telling me this and but now I
[1:08:28] see
[1:08:29] the Lord have mercy do I see now
[1:08:34] and let me tell you something
[1:08:36] you don't know what God's preparing you
[1:08:38] for
[1:08:40] something everyone already every one of
[1:08:43] it there's something God got for you to
[1:08:45] do
[1:08:47] I tell people back home God ain't never
[1:08:48] save us for nothing
[1:08:51] why would God save nothing to do nothing
[1:08:55] but God got something for you to do it
[1:08:58] maybe a one person
[1:09:00] you might have one person God wants you
[1:09:03] just to witness to one person something
[1:09:05] it's not your talking it's your living
[1:09:09] the best sermon we can preach mother
[1:09:12] Ernest is a life live before the people
[1:09:17] you are the best Thunder sermon let the
[1:09:20] love of God shed abroad in your heart
[1:09:22] just flow through you
[1:09:25] you'll bring more souls to the kingdom
[1:09:28] because believe it or not they're
[1:09:29] watching you
[1:09:32] you don't even think so even your enemy
[1:09:35] that one that cut up on the job that you
[1:09:37] and give you a hard time they're
[1:09:39] watching you
[1:09:41] as soon as you got to see me they'll say
[1:09:43] hey
[1:09:45] I thought you say you was a Christian
[1:09:50] you'll say it about us
[1:09:52] you know but
[1:09:55] but I understand that it's gonna take a
[1:09:58] revelation for us to understand that you
[1:10:01] tell but deep
[1:10:03] the love of God is deep
[1:10:06] and it's rich
[1:10:07] and it's powerful
[1:10:16] God no no gift
[1:10:20] no Dynamic message is greater
[1:10:24] no tongues no interpretation no prophecy
[1:10:27] but he said love all of these other
[1:10:31] gifts need to be surrounded with love
[1:10:35] to be effective
[1:10:39] that's why I enjoy listening to the
[1:10:40] spirit of God because he could go down
[1:10:42] on any any level
[1:10:44] and and reconcile the people no matter
[1:10:47] what they were in
[1:10:48] you know a lot of times he's talking to
[1:10:51] a woman preacher and he says sister you
[1:10:54] said you said a long call you he says go
[1:10:55] do what the Lord tell you to do
[1:10:58] wow
[1:10:59] we wouldn't do that in this the hill
[1:11:01] would we
[1:11:03] we're going to rebuke them sharply all
[1:11:06] right
[1:11:07] he dealt with all kind of people we have
[1:11:10] to learn we're gonna have to deal with
[1:11:11] all
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:18] not say you're compromised but you just
[1:11:20] share the goodness of God let God do the
[1:11:23] drawing
[1:11:25] see you gotta get all that there you
[1:11:27] know sixth Dimension and all of this
[1:11:30] right here no just just come to the
[1:11:32] basic bring them to Jesus
[1:11:36] and close it on this brother Ernest
[1:11:40] testimony on the sea
[1:11:43] he said we're on a great tantrum a great
[1:11:46] dress tantrum
[1:11:49] is just like in fashion like the world
[1:11:52] he said love not the world nor the
[1:11:55] things of the world if you do the love
[1:11:58] of God is not even in you he said I
[1:12:02] don't care how much you speak in tongue
[1:12:05] jump up and down dance cut hair wear
[1:12:08] dresses like that your man you man
[1:12:12] permitted your own fruits tell where you
[1:12:16] were at that's exactly right no wonder
[1:12:19] we're in such a chaos as we are in The
[1:12:23] Winds of the Communists in The Winds of
[1:12:26] this catechism in the world of
[1:12:28] economical organization he says because
[1:12:31] of we love the world more we love God
[1:12:36] God is looking for a church
[1:12:39] that is so out completely
[1:12:43] to him
[1:12:46] how do we get there God
[1:12:49] fill us with your love
[1:12:52] real love
[1:12:54] that's not partial love that's not picky
[1:12:58] love that not
[1:13:00] um you know sideway but genuine love for
[1:13:03] even my enemies
[1:13:07] because they hate you you don't have to
[1:13:09] have the same Spirit they have
[1:13:12] show love toward them and keep showing
[1:13:14] love toward them
[1:13:18] it takes God to do that
[1:13:20] God bless you tonight brother Ernest
[1:13:22] [Applause]
[1:13:32] how many enjoy the word tonight amen
[1:13:34] the love of God Amen I was thinking
[1:13:37] about when he was ministering tonight I
[1:13:39] was sharing with some people some
[1:13:41] testimonies of my life and the mindset
[1:13:43] that I used to have
[1:13:45] before the Lord saved me but in all that
[1:13:49] I was thinking I said but nevertheless
[1:13:52] God loved me in spite of
[1:13:55] all of that
[1:13:57] and all that I was sharing with the boys
[1:13:59] you could you couldn't even believe it
[1:14:02] who not not earnest
[1:14:04] but we all born in sin
[1:14:06] we all came in this world with a certain
[1:14:09] mind frame but through election God knew
[1:14:12] that one day we hear his voice
[1:14:14] so I said even in all of what I was
[1:14:17] dealing with him and doing going through
[1:14:19] I said God loved me in spite of all that
[1:14:23] you know Satan the devil accused you and
[1:14:25] all that but his love he loves you in
[1:14:27] spite of all that because he knew that
[1:14:29] one day you'd come to him so I was
[1:14:31] thinking about that you know tonight and
[1:14:33] I says you know if God can love us in
[1:14:36] spite of
[1:14:37] how much more we can love one another
[1:14:40] I was sharing with him at work as some
[1:14:43] people across the street homeless one
[1:14:44] time I said you know because they was
[1:14:46] making some remarks I said but my heart
[1:14:49] won't let me say those certain things
[1:14:51] I said because I realized the condition
[1:14:54] I was in the only reason why I ain't
[1:14:56] over there homeless is because of the
[1:14:58] grace of God
[1:15:00] the only reason why I ain't over there
[1:15:02] and ain't over here is because that's
[1:15:04] just the way God God this was the Lord's
[1:15:06] doing not none of mine so you look at
[1:15:09] yourself I says that how can you can't
[1:15:12] look down on nobody
[1:15:15] how can you look down on somebody
[1:15:17] because God didn't look down on you did
[1:15:19] he he looked down and uncovered you
[1:15:21] uncovered your life it'd have been bad
[1:15:24] wouldn't it
[1:15:25] he just pulled a cut the light on just
[1:15:28] to show those dark those dark spots that
[1:15:30] nobody didn't know you had in your life
[1:15:33] those things in your in your spirit
[1:15:35] that's all messed up God cut the light
[1:15:37] on there and exposed it right
[1:15:40] but he don't do that he loved you in
