we look to you this morning may you bless your word in jesus name amen second corinthians 4 and 1. ii corinthians 4 and 1. [Music] said therefore sin we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking and crafting this not handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man conscious in the sight of god but if our gospel will be heared it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the mind of them which believe not least the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god shall shine unto them but we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord ourselves your servant for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts given the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always burn about in the body the dying of our lord jesus that the life also jesus might be made manifest in our bodies for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifested in our modern flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sake that the abundance of grace might through the thanksgiving of many renown rebound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light afflictions which is but for a moment working for us are for exceeding an eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal regardless the reason towards you may be seated this morning we want to talk to you about looking to the unseen looking to the unseen and god's servant says [Music] we do not look with our eyes uh we do he said we did not see with our eyes that's the way he said we do not see with our eyes we look with our eyes we see with our heart in other words as we go to saint john three and three we kind of understand what he was saying saint john 3 and 3. he said we look with our eyes and we see we we do not see with our eyes we look with our eyes and we see with our heart we look with our eyes and we see with our heart here in saint john 3 and 3 nicodemus talked about to jesus rabbi we know that thou teaching to come from god because no man can do these miracles except god be with him and jesus asked and said unto him verily verily i sanded thee except for man be what the a man be what born again he cannot in other words that's why he said we cannot see we look with our eyes we cannot see with our eyes because we see with our heart in other words the sin that we're talking about is to understand and accept a man be born again he cannot see cannot understand the kingdom of god and that's why so many people are victims of looking but not sin because many they looked what they wasn't able to see and he told his disciples blessed are your eyes because you see for many thought they were sin but they were blind so he was saying in in second corinthians 4 he said if our gospel behead it is here to them that are lost amen because he said whom the god of this world has blinded the mind of them that what they believe not because they don't believe then the god of this world he blinds them and our eyes will deceive us because we look at what we see the problem with man is looking to what he see but i said look until the what unseen looking until the what unseen not to what we're deceived by what we see are you with me and that's where the devil works with your what you see with your eyes what you're looking at with your eyes the devil used your eyes to deceive you you remember he said all that is in the world is the lust of amen let's look at it again uh what was that first john 2 see the devil gonna use your eyes as a gate the bible says upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it the light of the body is the eye amen and the devil amen a blind you with the your natural eyes will deceive you he says in the 15th verse or the second first john second chapter he said love not the world what these are the things that are in the world amen if any man love the what love the world the love of the father is what for all that is in the world is what the lust of the flesh and what see the eyes will desire what god the body might want what the eyes see but there is a compartment that's in the heart we call the soul amen and the soul the bible says the just shall live by what amen and uh ii corinthians 5 it talks about we walk by faith not by sight so the soul must have the element of faith done in your heart the devil uses your head but god wants your heart the devil works with your intellect but god has that he wants to show the heart amen and it's very much that people are persuaded by what they see and they usually believe what they see but i say to you look until looking to the unseen the things that you cannot see because the things that you see are only temporal they're only temporary and and the devil was deceive you with the temporary things are you with me the things that only for a moment the things that only going to be here just for a season and a little while i think job styles it has a few days before he said a man that is born of a woman is over a few days amen and those few days are full of trouble oh you have been but jesus tried to take us to the unseen and he said let not your heart be what amen for in my father's house of many nations see jesus tried to elevate you out of the scene room into the unseen realm and give you something that you can trust in amen you cannot trust what you see every everything that you see amen it's temporal don't you ever forget it as a believer in christ don't base your hopes and your confidence on the things that you see but continue to look unto the unseen because he said faith is the substance of things what and it's the evidence of things so in your soul in your heart and in the inner man there's an outward man and there's an inward man he said though our aquaman what perish so the ark was seen what you see physically amen the outward man of perish amen we know that this world as we see with our natural odds it will perish amen that's why he said god so loved the world amen that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believed in him shall not amen so this this temporal world this amen but god wants you to amen the things that are not seen they are eternal are you a man so it's the unseen that we're trying to get you to understand but you cannot see or understand these things except you are born again see well if you're not born again you're not going to understand what we're talking about but if you have enough faith to believe this morning amen then you can't be born again because amen you must he said he that believeth on me as the scripture has said that out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water so to believe what god said is to cause a transformation a change with inside of the inner man the outside might resemble the same but the end of man god wants to get down into that inner man and faith in what god says will cause the inner man to be charged up and fired up it'll bring amen transformation in your life what you believe amen on the inside now this outside shell amen don't let it be amen your ultimate so as we said the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and what the pride of life this life now don't don't get caught up in this life here because he said which is not of the father and he said in the 17th verse the world as we know with what this world will pass away the bible said the elements going to melt with the what fervent heat it's going to burn up the world that we now know amen but peter took us takes us to the unseen he said but nevertheless he said now the world we know it's going to catch on fire it's going to burn up but peter said now i want you to look to the unseen nevertheless we are caught into his promise god has made you and i a promise we according to his promise look for a new heaven and a new earth weigh in dwell it it's not going to be righteousness right here amen but god has a new place amen and god amen let me go back here to the second corinthians because i i gotta move on because i want you to look into the unseen because god has gone to prepare a place for you that he said well i am that you may be also god wants to take you into the inner veil amen god wants to take you into a place amen amen that the natural man cannot see the things of god he does not know the things of god because he's only looking amen to the outside amen but god wants to go into the inner man into your soul and cause as amen that seed of god to be dermatized and quickened by his spirit and be brought to life and have the preeminence in your life hallelujah so here we are he said here in um uh the the latter verse of that chapter it says while we look not on the things which are what sing eighteenth verse why we look not on the things of the scene but the things which are not what see okay not i said looking until the what looking unto the unseen we're not looking at the things we're looking at the things that are not seen oh you look man okay it says for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen eternal now i want to go on to the fifth chapter and here and number one it says we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved amen now we know that but the world don't know that because they'll only look into what they see amen but we know that of our earthly house or this tabernacle you know what what got me as i was praying this morning it was the ability that people don't trust god they trust what they see but they don't trust they don't look to the unseen amen but to trust god is to believe what he says ain't meant to have enough confidence that god would do what he said i'm gonna skip over and almost go to the end of what i was had prepared and go to hold it down and conventions there and then let me go to first john 5. because a lack of confidence is is is what traps man first john fight because we don't have a confidence in god you never ask god you know when you lose confidence in a person you know many people amen they lose confidence in ministry they lose confidence and husband lose confidence in wife they lose confidence in children once you lose confidence in them you don't trust them no more you know it doesn't matter how well or how much if a person you know if i if i'm passionate a person lose confidence in me you know i can't help them it's no way for me to help a person if they don't have confidence in them in you and matter of fact if they go to you to ask you something they ain't got confidence in you i mean i don't care how well you counsel them i don't care how well you talk to them if what you tell them they don't have confidence in you it don't mean nothing either way you just waste a whole lot of time are you with me because if a person don't have confidence in you they just going through the motion but they must have confidence in you in order to trust you are you with me because if they don't have if you don't have confidence in god who he is and what he can do for you then you don't actually go to god and ask him for anything but if you know that he is god and he can help you are you with me i said the reason why we look to the scene but we don't look to the unseen you know sometimes god can look beyond david's fault and he can seek god david's heart and and sometimes folk would look at david and amen uh adulterers and what he did to the best even how he got your eyes killed and how he did this but god looked beyond his faults and he saw his heart and god was able to amen come as son of david amen to be identified with david as oh lord can you see that god gonna be identified as son of david amen i won't you be ashamed to be identified with oh with god amen wretched mercy it just shows you how much he loves us how much he cares about us how god sees amen the man sees the outward appearance but god sees the word god sees the heart amen it doesn't matter how you come up to your email uh revelation or understanding but god sees your heart amen you might make many uh mistakes and you might fall many times but god knows your heart god knows you amen that sometimes amen you got to say i'm a failure amen and i know i'm a failure but god you know my heart holly do you if something down in the inside won't let me go amen the devil said you ready well give up forget it you failed too much remember something telling me to go ahead something inside me telling me to go ahead you know let me focus look at me despise me folks said even you're washed up but something inside me telling me to go ahead go ahead anyhow amy don't give up it doesn't matter what they think about you keep on pressing on hallelujah they've been knocked down but not knocked out amen you knocked me down but i'm not knocked out oh hallelujah cast down but not forsaken perplexed but i'm not in despair amen are you with me i'm not giving up on god many are the affliction of the righteous but the lord shall deliver them out of them all are you praise god the doctors might have said such a bevel is all over but god said it ain't over amen to god says it's over hallelujah praise god oh to see brother frank and listen to his voice amen the encouragement amen that god can do anything amen nothing too hard for him god is good he's a master for god god god can handle your situation god can reach town and he can oh hallelujah you can pick you up hallelujah now hearing on first john 5 here in 14 he says for this is the confidence that we have where first john 5 and 14. for and this is the confident that we have what that's what all i'm asking you to do brother sisters look to the unseen and this is the confidence that we have in brother simmons and mama and daddy and wife and husbands and children but this is the confidence that we have in him pray praise god amen because you can have confidence in me and and i can act crazy or do something stupid you can have confidence in your husband he can do some crazy stuff or say something oh lord amen but this is the confident you know what you know the bible said you didn't run well who didn't handle you you ran well who handed you who should separate us from the love of god looking into the unseen don't look into the circumstances and conditioning things that happen amen he talked about a lot of things i'm despairing i'm perplexing i oh god i go through some things that trouble on every side but i ain't giving up why because i know that the things that i'm going through a temporary but i know that god got a far exceeded weight of glory repent i know what god has prepared for them that if i can go through this little room there's a little while that i got to go through let me go through hallelujah praise god husband turned it back on your wife turned it back children to go forsaken but let me go through this a little while just a little while long oh hallelujah realizing your pain your hurt is going to be for a little while it's a little your pain your sorrows your hurt your disappointment it's only going to be for a season just a little while look not at those things because they're only temporal even look until they're unseen look beyond that amen that's you get discouraged because why are you okay for this is the confidence that we have where in him amen praise god and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we what i'm gonna tell you something james said when we act we cannot we actually miss and that's what therefore we don't get what we and he said when you ask the double mind man is unstable in all his ways when you ask god for something if you trust him you believe it amen don't be double-minded don't ask god for to do something and don't believe he can do it how do i your action shows amen that you don't believe that god can do what you ask them to do we go we turn around and we take matters in our own hands and we already said i'm leaving in the hand of the lord that's just your words your action shows whether or not you're leaving in the hands of the lord or not if you're gonna leave it in the hand of the lord if you have confidence in god that he is god that fights your battles that gives you the victory that overcomes the world amen because you have faith in him you got confidence in god god if you did it then you'll do it now god i don't know how but i know you will hallelujah i gotta have enough passion to wait on god praise god he'll bring you out if you trust and never doubt he will surely bring you out take your battle to the law and leave him down well i'll leave him there amen oh yes i'll trust him amen don't you doubt the lord oh he'll do what he's saying he says that we ask anything according to his what and we know his will is his what his word or we ask anything according to his will he what he hears us do you believe me here his ear is open to the cry amen them that put their trust in him amen god ear is open to your cry amen and god ear is not heavy that he cannot hear his arm is not short that he cannot save amen god knows how to do it but oh hallelujah oh what disturbs me this morning as i was praying i said oh god let me i felt like running around the church amen because amen the confident that we have in him i'm not going to be alone this morning lord's will but it's a lack of confidence a lot of trust in god you know we want to put our unbelief on everybody else and we want to blame everybody else for what we're going through it's a lack of confidence in god amen we want to put our amen unbelief in our faith and our amen oh we want to put it on somebody else amen but amen i heard somebody say this me it's me oh lord standing in the need of prayer amen nobody thought but mine oh if i die my soul is lost it ain't nobody fought my mind are you with me if i don't have what uh they may ask him for then it ain't god's fault amen i want to know whether you trust him enough they mean it doesn't matter how long it takes i am determined to take god at his word oh yes i have a determination i i made up my mind that god is my lord he's my god amen somebody said it may not come when you want him but he'll be there on time amen he's a longtime guard and he'll be there amen he'll show up praise god he might let you go through a little something he'll show up he'll get there he won't let you down praise god he won't let you down hallelujah praise god you see it's all right to help enjoy the word of god and let the real word of god renew your spirit and renew your mind and absolve and let it sink down in the inside and let your soul be revived amen that you can drink of the water and amen praise god to the thirsty soul and let it stir up something inside yes lord thank you for coming by to see about me and helping me on the way amen i i can only speak to you what he speaks to my spirit amen and i can just share it with you amen as i begin to trust god for something to say to you and god comes and begin to minister to me that i can minister it back to you amen praise god because if it's good to me amen praise god and if it's for me oh lord and i said god what you want for your children amen what you want them to hear amen now look he says if it's conscious we we know he hears us and if the 15th verse if we know that he hears us whatsoever we act we know that we have the what the petition that we what that we deserve here i want you to go away from here this morning amen if you have got enough confidence in god to ask to know that we have the petition to have enough confidence god i'm asking you and then to know that we have it amen because i know god wants me to have it god wants your home to be blessed god wants your marriages to be blessed god wants your children to be blessed god wants you to be prosperous and in health that's the will of god amen for you and for your life amen so it's all right to acts according to his word and caught his will amen it's all right to have enough faith and confidence in god that if i ask anything amen according to his will i know he is amen i can desire things
