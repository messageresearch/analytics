guide me you o God move here today by your spirit in the working of your Mighty power when we leave here knowing oh God that you spoke to our needs Lord God you touch you heal you delivered you're set free God fill somebody with your spirit in Jesus name we pray amen the book of Acts 13 acts 13 and 44. I read the first you read the next and re-read the last verse together acts 13 and 44. the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the words of God 45. and then Paul and barnwell's wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should be first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles 47. and when the Gentiles heard this they were Glide and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believe 49. but the Jews stirred up The Devout and honorable women and the chief men of the city and raise persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their course 51. gather the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost may God bless you read this word you may be seated in the 48th verse she says at the end of it it says as many as were ordained to eternal life believe you know I I I was telling them Marlins on Thursday that we were gonna start it off with uh born for a purpose for this purpose or this cause was I born but I thought we just this morning die of praying and ordained to eternal life I just couldn't get away from it it looked like it's all running together ordained to eternal life now sometimes we struggle in trying to understand the mind of God and understand the purpose of God and the will of God just trying to understand God man in this finite mind cannot understand the infinite Mind Of God but yet he tries to figure out and he blames god with his little finite mind amen knowing that God by violence he said your thoughts are not my thoughts and and and see what man think that he's just got a little intellect that God allows him to have for a few moments and so he he tries to figure out that amen that he can come back God and what God purpose and what God is doing he tries to bombard he tries to understand see if we're going to serve God the Bible said he that cometh to God because first of all believe that he is and he is a reward of them that dealing to seek him and it is something about believing that God is amen he said the invisible thing to God had clearly May has seen by the things which are made so you see the heaven you see the Earth you see even yourself the Bible said is he has made us and not we ourselves well you know where do we come from amen the Bible said God created man in his own image in his own likeness are you with me now if you can figure out another means another way as a scientific world through the test to I mean to twos and all kind of mixing of Steve or what what did they get this uh seed from or whatever to mix are you with me man can only pervert what God has already made so uh a day to eternal life these uh Jews that God was the chosen people supposedly be amen that supposedly have God but yet they find it necessary amen when light has come amen that they had the Old Testament and as the day we have the Bible they had the Old Testament they could say well we got the Bible we got Moses Abraham Isaac and Jacob but when God seemed to look like he's stepping out of the pages of the Bible and he's actually amen uh moving for amen the pro the prophecy amen and to the prophecy being fulfilled amen the word of God that was led up was being made manifested in the flesh but yet they could not recognize the manifestation of God God was amen stepping out of History amen and he was coming on the scene same thing they struggled because they had the letter they could go back and read Moses they could go back and read their Bibles on the side of the street now amen if God does something today amen a man that is religious go to church got their Bible they can look in their Bible and read it but when the when the word becomes alive they fail to see it amen now though the scripture said a virgin shall conceived yet when a virgin conceded who want to believe something like that I've talked about God's people that read their Bible all the time but yet when Mary comes on the scene amen you so Jesus you've been born a fornication come on man get away from that you know you we don't believe that those were God said he came into his own but his own what if he came the day he would come in the same way because the Bible said Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever amen what you already said in your religion said in your church said in your ideals amen when the word of God come you already think you got it amen what we need we already got God what we need we already got the word what we need we don't need nothing else amen and that's what it and so Paul even Saul or Paul amen he called amen a ridiculous thing man this is mine this is uh heresy uh this is uh uh what are y'all trying to do we ain't got the one God y'all worship this one called Jesus what in the world we got Jehovah but they had Jehovah only in letter form only in the traditional form amen yet when uh amen the word became life they could not recognize the word being made and manifest because why they already thought they had it and when we already think we got what we it takes amen we don't see no father amen and accepting nothing else and God don't want you to accept another God but he wants you to accept God when he reveals himself in his own word are you up man God won't say Amen tell you you cannot relax amen because you amen come to church see sometimes we feel secured we feel secured in our uh uh our religious spirit amen sometimes we don't know where we get our spirit from and no more mother that God did a lot of wonderful things it meant to the Jews and a lot of Miracles and things that they could testify amen that God did in their lives you had a lot of folks that the new God and God had moved in their life and they had testimonies but hear the word amen for that day they could not recognize and that's what is happening amen people amen are are ready to say I know I know God what God heard my prayer God did this God did that yet when Jesus came on the scene no we don't need you amen if Jesus came today what would you stand would you be like one of these Jews hey what y'all doing you know what I'm saying that Jesus came today he would come the same way he came then amen he would come to you and you would already be secured already be I got everything I need I know God hurt myself oh Lord and it wasn't that Jesus didn't come to condemn the world but what save the world I came to seek and save that which is lost amen I didn't come to destroy what you got but I come to fulfill I I I didn't come to take the law away from you but I came to fulfill amen I want you to know that there's been a dispensation of change amen and I want you to know that for this time the law and the prophets were until John but from this time the kingdom of what God is fruit amen God he was talking about the kingdom has come amen and because the kingdom of God is preached they didn't want it why because they were already they've got my uh they were talking about David amen and this is what he says this is what this is what got them really mad in the 13th chapter he said in the 33rd verse she says God has fulfilled the same unto us and their children in that he has raised up Jesus again as it is also written in the second song Thou Art my what thou my son this day have I what and as concerning that he raised up him up from the dead now no more to return to what corruption he said on this wise I will give you the sure mercies of David wherefore he has he said also in another song thou shall not what you mean to tell me Jesus did not seek corruption are you with me y'all what y'all talking about so this is strange to the here and they had never heard such a thing but it was written in the scripture he was taking them back to the Bible yet they didn't want to believe it because they didn't want to believe in this Jesus that they have taken their wicked hands they've crucified and slain neither were the word is made manifested through the religious spirits today want to believe what the word says because they already think they got it are you a man when you think you got it amen it says for David I'm gonna tell you there's something can you see a ball it man we're talking about the kingdom that it's come and talk about a king and uh what what y'all what's wrong with these people that's what the Jews said y'all now y'all don't believe something like that don't you know we got the Jehovah God we got Abraham we got prophecy we got oh God Kings and you telling me about Jesus oh the attitude of those people that day is the same attitude of the people today that's why people even can sit inside Brad Tabernacle and have that same nasty spirit are you with me they can sit here and the word you see because if you're not a thing to eternal life you can't receive you can't believe are you with me you say I don't care who I ain't gonna believe it no you won't believe it because you got to be a name to eternal life are you with me and eternal life is in his son are you with me and if you're gonna receive his son you're gonna receive his word are you with me you cannot receive the Son of God and not receive the word of God because the word is eternal life are you with me but a lot of folks say I receive Jesus but the word of God is eternal life he was the word but he was the word manifested brother and sister you were going for a purpose and I can't get there this morning but you were born to manifest the word and to manifest the word of God for your day and the hour you live in not amen trying to manifest what Moses did or what Noah did but you the manifested word in this last day hour God has chosen you here now to be the light of the manifestation of the word are you with me when God said let there be light there was light and you are the light of the world are you up there so God has chosen you to light up this dark and corrupt age that we're living in God has chosen you amen as the light even Jesus said I am the light of the world but men love Darkness rather than light because they're white the Deeds are evil amen if they were of the light they would come to the light are you with me I'm not you know you said well what's the preface Amy tell everybody God loves you and everybody going to heaven and it's going to be all right but if if everybody went to heaven it'd be just like it is here are you with me we have all this sin corruption all this oh me nasty all this all this filthy and all these spirits that these people are going to carry to help them with them because if they go to experience going with them isn't that right if you go to heaven your attitude gonna go right there with you I I know God and let me I heard one uh a man of God says oh Lord I call the man of God because you say he is one of the largest churches in Colombia I was at a funeral and the preacher said um it was one of our friends came up in church with us but she sort of went to her persuasion and she became a minister and at her funeral the the Pastor said oh when sister so and so on get to heaven she gonna say I don't want to see Jesus but I want to see Paul because I'm going to straighten you out when you said a woman couldn't preach you know I felt like what's wrong with this all these people said here what's wrong with them and this man a teacher in at the college teaching preachers and all and everything can articulate I could never touch him in preaching but we're not trying to it's the truth that we're interested in not in how well you can speak and how well you can I intelligent you are but it's a word could you imagine somebody with that kind of intelligence a teacher of preachers and yet he assess a statement like that I don't want to see Jesus I want to see Paul where I can straighten them out Lord have mercy are you with me but I I believe that today some people if they would examine themselves they'll straighten out some of the men of God that God used in such a supernatural ways and they'll tell them amen you must have a Devil Within you because I don't believe you would you you you you're true see sometimes people think that my experience with God and my intellectual intelligence even though amen I may not be as apologize you but one thing I do know I oh Lord have mercy you see what I'm saying we've got in our minds that we're we're in a place that we can examine enough amen God are you with me that we put God up into our little uh on our scale God is Not on your scale on my scale God is above our scale it's either above all that we can ask I think amen he's Beyond amen we can't and we oh your thoughts are not my thoughts and your ways are not my ways you can't oh Lord only thing amen God allows us through his Spirit just to understand what we do understand amen and that's only by the grace of God that God gives you amen a potion amen imagine and not every man has the same measure are you with me but it's only God's grace to us in our lives that God gives us Grace amen that we have imagined so thank God for the little magic that he gives us but God let me see so so he says I I got to go on I gotta I gotta off but y'all y'all sometimes you get amen people can say some stuff amen I'm saying to you this morning be careful what you think be careful about your thoughts and be very careful what come out your mouth you know some things people can say out their mouth I couldn't say you know I I hate to hear people say the n-word when they said I sound like they're cursing and I said wow I can't hear that don't don't don't don't let don't be so loose with the tongue try to try to be careful how you speak just because it used to you know it's a terminology no no no no no be careful how you speak Amen Let Your word be with Grace you're Christians let your words be with Grace season with salt be careful what you say how how it comes off you know if you got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost you know attack you are you up man you you don't speak like that you can't say anything out your mouth amen the closer you get to God you'll find yourself walking in more maturity but when you fall off man everything can fly out your mind any kind of way you can say anything you know what I'm saying but once you once you get closer to God you examine how you say what you say are you a man now that you trying to examine it it's the holy spirit in you that won't let you say certain things and when you said it ought to check you you can't just be I I just the way I am no no no God don't have to take you the Way You Are he wants to make you the way he wants you to be are you a man God can't use you he wants to the new man amen which is created in Christ Jesus amen the recreated man the new man the new you are you with me so don't let anything come out your mouth okay I gotta go move on move on but ordain into eternal life now you couldn't tell those people you couldn't confess to him that they wouldn't have known to eternal life you couldn't convince them that they didn't have everything they needed that's what the Jews they had seen they heard about all the signs and wonders and there was God's special chosen people they were God's people but mind you Moses was born for a purpose isn't that right and the purpose because when he was born the the mother they saw that he was a proper child he was special so they put him in a little bastard and put him on the river and the Pharaoh daughter got him isn't that right God got away amen if he ordained you for a purpose God got a way to make sure that that purpose is fulfilled are you with me your reaction and your response to the word of God shows your destiny are you with me how you respond to the word it shows whether or not you believe the word or not those that were dead to eternal life the Bible said they believed the rest of my arms they persecuted they they talked about it they wanted to kill Paul and Barnabas were they not Jews were they not the religious Church Gods or whatever yeah but they couldn't they couldn't receive the word why because it was new to their ears and anything new to us I can't believe that but if you have if you ordained to eternal life something in you said I believe it it's got to be that that that that that that that firm desired that's something not inside your bones it says I believe it um Romans 8 I gotta move on I I know I'm behind time now Romans 8 and 14. it says for as many as the led by the spirit of God they are the what sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry what father the spirit itself witness with our spirit uh excuse me the spirit is said that witness with our spirit that we are the what now if the spirit don't bear witness that you you are a son or daughter God you're children of God then what what's what's going on it's got to be something inside your bad Witness amen you know I wrote some diners and then prayer this morning I wrote something down uh depression pressure pressure will cause what's in you to come out of you pressure wood you saw yourself some folks I didn't mean to curse yes you did it was in you I didn't mean to slap you it was in you it just shows you you might have a gross a growth spurt where you need to grow you might need to get some of that stuff out of you that's in you and God allows you to do certain things to show that it's something in you the need to get out of you are you up man so a lot of things that's in us that we think that way I got the Holy Ghost Inside the inside of my bone amen I got fire in my bone and then God shows some other kind of Fire coming out of there some of some mean hatred father some Fighting fight amen it's not all love but God wants you to be so full of the love of God Amen and the power of forgiveness that you don't even recognize to your brother your sister what was done to you amen 10 years ago 20 years ago amen I will what I've been through what I went through I ain't gonna let my children go through and I'm gonna stand up for them you better let God take care of things you better walk in forgiveness and let God take care of things but if you try to take care of things on your own you're gonna get yourself in a big mess you got to walk in the love of God Amen and you you know when you walk in the love of God pain is going to change anyhow amen you'll find out you know when things start happening amen God's uh just positive people start reaping what they sow is not because you wanted it to happen amen things just gonna happen whatsoever man so naturally also reap don't worry about it but in your heart it's the love of God it's forgiveness in your heart it said God I want more of you Lord Lord I love you I just want your purpose your will to be done so Russia brings things up the best of the worst are you with me if you want to see the wax let pressure come you want to see it fast let pressure come how you respond to pressure determines what's in the inside of you amen I I mean the best of us could uh respond oh you know somebody catch you on a slide and pop up man you know knock them out they just got you on God then you you pick him up and shake the hand my wife said I had a dream somebody say to me I told my wife somebody come up to me go around telling lies on me tell me you committed that Daughtry and I I said I took him and put them into my [Laughter] I knocked him I didn't know she said what you did it's just telling the children you know what your daddy said can you imagine your daddy punching somebody knock them out I said oh well by the grace of God then uh I said well you know I said I don't know what that means somebody lying on you and uh so by the grace God we all go go through certain things it was a little bit more to it but I got it right now but but by the grace of God I said that person alive I've been all around the world nobody could say I've done nothing like that oh you see what I'm saying a lot of Grace all righty crazy girl and you didn't know you sometimes you don't know what's in you what's in you come out something hurts you to your heart amen and you were respond in such a way are you with me and so you don't know what's going to what is going to take to bring some stuff out you oh you have been well some stuff can hit you so hard and you don't react before you know you reacted I didn't even know I had I didn't have that in my notes now I didn't know I was going to say it I was you know that was something I probably would have kept at home but by the grace of God let me let me go on um God is good amen he said the 17th verse it says and if children they're in the ears of God then ears and ears of God and Jonah is with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also what glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be what compared with the what the glory that shall be revealed where in us get that resonate with you see the word of God who resonates you know it means something it kind of touches it kind of says something to my spirit as a Son of God it kind of speaks to me but when you are not a danger eternal life it doesn't speak to you you surround isn't somebody reading the Bible but when it speaks to you amen and it resonates what's inside of you amen you say thank you Jesus you know it was something about Jacob and Esau he said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hate it amen before the children ever born God had already returned one I love nothing I hate now why did God do such a thing like that I'll tell you why in a minute he said in the next verse for the earn his expectation of the creature waiting for the what see what what all creation is waiting on you and I to be made manifested the manifestation of the sons of God now Jesus knew when his hour come we got to know that it's a time that God all creation is waiting on you and I to be manifested sons of God that that your purpose will be in here in the earth is to come to full maturity the corner we've got to get right and then the top that he met the son amen right into the sea praise God for the hardest time are you up man so you coming in the form Madison station amen what the grain the corner wheat falls in the ground and die amen it abide the law but if it died it'll bring full forward oh you look man so Jesus amen talks about us sir we will see Jesus amen it's the time amen that we're not in amen praise in planning time and we're not in the growth Spirit but we're in Harvest Time amen when you fully come to maturity in this hour the church that went

and 18. I'm gonna read this portion first Peter I'm rejoicing in in the whole program glory of God it's a lot of things election is therefore according to full knowledge God has elected us we are the elect we are chosen but election is according to full knowledge and full knowledge is according to the election God is I'm not science he knows everything the Bible tells us he knows the end from what so the choices that you make by full knowledge regarding men are all knowing he knew what you would be before you were ever born and he knew your choices that you would make so he could speak in the Bible before uh Jacob and Esau was ever born said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated because he knew the actions that Esau was going to take and God knows your thoughts and the actions in the tents of your heart God know what your heart want to do he know exactly what you got in your mind your intent of your heart he knows exactly because he's the word of God he knows your thoughts and intent of your heart he knows exactly what you want to do and you can't hide it from God are you with me so if you don't you don't intend to do right don't you think you're gonna get by and you so smart I I I I don't have to comply with your word God knows you already don't worry about a thing you wouldn't have tank ordained the eternal life anyway so God ain't worried about that God still he's still in control but if you're a danger eternal life it's something not inside you that harmless and thirst for God yes you might have a lot of things blocking you a lot of things knocking you a lot of things against you but not in your heart there's a yearning there's a desire I want to be a Christian I want to live for God God I know that you chose me that I oh Lord there's something about that ain't
