church on time to hear foolishness but we come to see Jesus and Lord we pray that you come on the scene and move all flesh out the way that you might get Glory that you might get praise and Jesus Jesus wonderful name we thank you amen as we stand the Book of Genesis 1. appreciate the Saints uh making it up this morning amen brother Gordon and sister Rachel had a episode with the door I said Lord thank the lord we could get in the building amen amen man God is good if you haven't say man Genesis 1 and one in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light D and the Darkness he called night and the evening in the morning were the first day may the Lord had a blessing to the reason that this word you may be seated I thought this morning identified Christ of all ages identified Christ of all ages so we look to be identified of Christ in this age and as I read the scriptures he called the light day and the Darkness he called night and when you look at what that word identified that word identified means to be like something a image of something so when you're walking do the through the day you have a shadow or image of yourself so identify a Christ of all ages as we look in the word we want to see Jesus and we want to look like him we want to be like him and we want to act like him so any way that we are acting that is not like him is not identifying ourselves right John 1. Saint John 1. and I don't want to move too fast sometimes I move a little fast Saint John 1 and 1. he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made so this morning each and every one of us was made by God in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not so to this morning if we're going to comprehend the things of God we have to be in the light we have to be part of the light and there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light see we are not that light but we come to Bear witness of that light and when we bear witness of the True Light that's Jesus then we'll draw men to Christ that was the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood not of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God so identify Christ of this age we're looking at a birth we're looking at something that identifies you with his word so if you are identified with his word this morning I don't get too excited because I I want to teach this morning if you identified with his word then you will look like Christ you will look like the word Hebrews 1. God who had sun-dried times and in diverse manners she speaking time paths unto the fathers by the prophets helping these last days spoken to us by his son who have appointed heir of all things who've been who may who also made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person of holding All Things by the word of his power and when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of God and the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he by inheritance obtain a more excellent Name than they For unto the Angels which he said at any time thought might son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he should be to me a son and again when he bringeth the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship Him so as we are identifying ourselves with Christ we are looking at the mirror the word and we're looking and the word is our mirror we are identifying ourselves in such a way that Jesus is in US how he's in us this morning he's in Us by his word you know I tell the church I said if you want to get closer to God read your Bible and pray every day but when you it's it's where you are dwelling at my subtopic today is where you are living identify Christ of all ages there are three places that you are living at one of the places is justification that's the outer quotes and then you got the Intercourse which is sanctification and then you have the wholeness of wholeness is where you are dwelling at a man that I was working on last Thursday it's the manner that you were eating is the same manner but it's where you are keeping yourself that's what God is looking for when you're eating the Manna is where you are eating at you're in the Tabernacle and it's where you are eating the manna see Jesus said in Isaiah 53 he said I Justified many many he justified her but we must go beyond justification is where you are eating the same manner that you were eating but if you were eating any justification it's going to go bad and you're gonna have to get new Mana sanctification it's the holy place is where you are eating the Manna it increases your faith you're clean and you're holy but that manner still dies it has worms in it but in the most holy place the Tabernacle is where the manner never goes bad so now you are on the mountain top all the time you are on the Mount Sinai as you say so it's where you are eating the manna where you are placed at in the Tabernacle sometimes I'm saved sometimes I'm not saved you know that's where it is but when you are in the most holy place there's the manner never goes bad Hebrews 10 and 7. the Lord had me deal with this to let people know where we are at why I have so much trouble trying to live a Christian Life why I have so much trouble to doing this and doing that why I I got I got faith and then the next minute I don't have faith I'm venturing without Authority I got all faith today and tomorrow I'm sad I'm on the I'm on I'm in the dumps Hebrews 10 and 7. he said then low said I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God and above when he says sacrifices and offerings and burnt offers and offerings for sin Thy word is not neither have pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second now let's go to verse 19. having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus have boldness have therefore Brethren boldness to any to the holy that's where we supposed to be in the most holy place that's where we're supposed to dwell to the holiest by the blood of Jesus by New and Living Way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh so the more you read your Bible the more you pray you entering into the holy place the most holy place and that is where you abide that is where your faith cannot be touched that is where the supernatural takes place right there in that place where God is dwelling with you Aaron went back there one year with a dead stick he passed through justification the stick was still dead he passed through sanctification it was still dead but when he left it back there by accident in the most holy place Glory begin the butt almonds uh a dead stick back day in the most holy place it begin to live church do you understand what I'm saying it's living back there you must get back there if you want eternal life these are coming the volume of the book he come that the veil may be rent in Twain from top to bottom that you you don't need the pastor the Deacon or the trustee you can enter into the holies of holies yourself that's why the Bible says in Revelation he has made us Kings and Priests what a king do he has a kingdom and what a priest does he has a service he's wrapped in my around the waist he is in service for the Lord second Corinthians 5 and 14. For the Love of Christ constraineth us because we that we just judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that he which live should not henceforth live unto themselves see God don't want you to live unto yourself he wants you to live in him self but unto him which died for them and rose again you're living for him you died and you Rigamortis set in and you're living for him oh they die that died which shall live wherefore henceforth now know we no man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more so you don't know no man after the flesh once he's born again once he's died death bell and Resurrection he died you've died to the things of the world it's you got to examine where you are living and once you examine where you are living then you can move forward see the Tabernacle has furniture all through I the fact that Tabernacle in justification position in place certain Furniture in justification and you can't stay there you must pass through to sanctification and there are certain Furniture in sanctification to bring it all to the sacrifice the Candlestick but you can't stop there you must go Beyond the Veil and when you go Beyond the Veil the curtain drops behind you and when the curtain drops behind you then it's you and God not nobody else in the church not your mother not your father not your brother not your sister not your husband your wife then the cotton drops then it's you and God together and now that's the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally that is why the Bible says if thou shall confess without mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thy heart that God has raising from the dead thou shall be saved with the heart the man believeth unto righteousness and see when God touch you and take you into that most holy place you want to go back there that is where life is that is whether understanding of the blood of Jesus that is where the righteousness of God is and once you go back there you'll never be the same you will never be the same and when you come out of there you can only love one another no matter what takes place in your life you are loved with guppy love why no matter how somebody treats you you're going to continue to love them I thank the Lord for his grace me and brother Johnny was dealing with some some family members that's real religious and I didn't know which way to go and my wife said you don't met your match now your cousin boy I tell you she is a preacher preachers ain't no scripture she don't know in the Bible she can't let she won't let me talk yeah I can't get an inch on her and she said pastor you are the greatest I said he said nothing you did all the talking and we prayed for she's going to court and the judge looked at it last week and thrown it out of court and she called me three four times and me and my wife looking at the phone I said should I answered I said I don't know that's a glory to God she's I'm just going to talk with you a minute pastor clue of family her daughters went to school with me so I'm just gonna talk a minute with you I answered the phone she talked hour and a half glory to God I talked with her yesterday she said I'm just going to talk with you man I called you yesterday she just said praise the Lord and was on the phone four minutes she's a pastor I thank you but the Holy Spirit revealed to me me and brother Johnny was dealing with her both of our family members and the Holy Spirit said she's in a place you can't help her he said but pray for her as a family member and love as a sister in Christ she's almost the age of my mom but I'ma tell you her her brain is like photographic memory as you put most preachers to shame the way you preach and talk but I said goodness of Grace she said when you came down to preaching something at the church either one told the pastor to bring you down there I said thank the Lord I love her with everything in me but I can't talk to her amen so the holy spirit said this is where I positionly placed her you can help her from a distance only ensure love and God revealed that to me yesterday in prayer with me and brother John at the church prayer and I told him that's where God reveal and see once once you get back into that Holy place that most holy place it ain't normal you it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and once the word is revealed to you then now he'll make known unto you the riches of his glory which is Christ in you and that unction which is the Holy Ghost which is the life of God coming inside of you revealing to you the things that are taking place and the scriptures look what he says wherefore here henceforth no no weed man no more after the flesh do we have known Christ after the flesh yet now no we hits him no more therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature he's a new creature old things are passed away behold All Things become new all things of God who have reconciled us by himself to himself by Jesus Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation so God reconciled you in Christ that's the reason the atonement was made to reconcile you back in Christ see the atonement was that when his blood was shed for you he'll turn a calorie now your blood no good my blood no good nobody blood no good but the atoning grace of the blood of Jesus when it was shed you could come boldly before the throne of grace as Hebrews said and find help in a time of trouble so now the blood that was spilled 2 000 years ago has not lost any power to save it can save to the atomosa because Isaiah said you have believed our report and to who the arm of the Lord been revealed he should grow up as a tender plant and a root out of dry ground and there's no formal covenants that we should see of him but we was wounded for our transgressions he would bruise for you and our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes you were healed and it's not just physical healing it's spiritual healing this morning God is spiritually healing you this morning because the blood of Jesus and when you accept that blood the atoning of that blood your sins has been pardoned through the blood of Christ that's why Peter can say with the blood of God and Paul could say it was the blood of Christ because he met him on the road to the Masters in Acts 9. he didn't see Jesus in the flesh but he saw him in Christ [Music] amen look what he says therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things will pass away behold All Things become new so when you are in Christ then there's something First Corinthians 12 and 13 said by one Spirit we all baptize into one body we are in the body of Christ not in the church physically but you're in body of Christ you are baptized into that body by the Holy Ghost and if you're not baptized into that body then you're not in that body Romans 12 and 1 said therefore brethren beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable for service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is a good and acceptable and perfect will of God see your mind is not going to tell you what is right Proverbs says your heart is wickedly and deceitful Above All Things who can know it but when you get Jesus inside of you will you get the Holy Ghost in you that's why he told Nicodemus you're a rule of the Jews but you must be born again and Nicodemus didn't understand what he said but he was a smart man he had a doctorate degree he said you must be gone born again and he said it's wind blood red listen and I'll hear the sound there but can't tell what's it here comes oh yes go so is everyone that is born of the spirit so the spirit of Christ will lead you into all truth John 16 and 13 say he the spirit of Truth has come he will not speak nothing of himself but he only see what the word says and all things of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given us the minister of reconciliation to which that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses unto themselves and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ so if you're an ambassador for Christ you shouldn't be ashamed of it you should be able to tell somebody about it an ambassador of U.N Nations United States Senate Ambassador over to Russia he's in representative for U.S so if you had an ambassador for Christ you are his God's Representatives on this Earth so wherever you go whoever you talk to is Christ you don't talk about what you've done your ministry it is Christ you talk about why because Christ is the one that brought you out of darkness and translated you into the kingdom of his dear son that's what Colossians 1 says you've translated us out of Darkness into the kingdom of his dear son and if you're in his kingdom then your part of his kingdom so now you are an ambassador for Christ and he is the word for he that made him to be sin for us that that knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so you are made the righteousness of God in him so it's no more you do what you want to do is Christ in you you're doing what Christ is saying you're doing what the word's saying John 15. John 15. you're doing what Christ is saying you doing what the word's saying John 15. John 15 and 26. I'm gonna read something here though the Lutheran Age come forth the judge shall live by faith that's the outer courts Along come the method is aged which is sanctification came the second definite work of Grace which came in that age that was under the altar age see the altar is the heart and then in the last days the restoration of the Holy Spirit the hidden life and I'm sure right there is where the trouble lies I want you to see it said most Christians can't deviate between the most holy place and the holy place the sanctification they live a clean life but the spirit of God has to fill you up the cup has come out of justification it's cleaned up it's washed then it's set out for service but not in service the Holy Spirit has to fill it up that's why Ezekiel 36 said I give you a new spirit to dwell with your spirit see some people so mean as the devil some people this is mean as the devil they can't even cope with themselves they're just so mean and nasty he said I'll give you a new spirit to deal with your spirit because you're so mean no no love is there just pure hatred and mean and then he said once you deal with that Spirit then I'll put my spirit in you Ezekiel talks about in John Joel 2 and 28. then I'll put my spirit in you see the new spirit is not your spirit and the new spirit is not the Holy Spirit but he'll give you a new spirit to deal with your spirit in sanctification until you get your life and you totally surrender to God then he'll send his spirit and then his Spirit a commandment a cup of obedience to the spirit of Christ then you see the spirit of Spirit of Christ The Works of the flesh which are manifested which are these The Works of the spirit which you manifests are these The Works of the soul is only faith in God's word see justification is just the outer courts sanctification is the Intercourse yes you almost there prevent potentially but down in there is where you and God meet and you and him alone he deals with Gentiles as individuals he deals with Israel as a nation when you meet in there in that place the most holy place you will never be the same yes you can go to church yes you can be an upstanding Christian but it's going to come a time that you'll be tested and find out where you stand and if you're standing on a solid rock which is Jesus glory to God you're standing on that Solid Rock talking to some guys at work and they look like they wanted to argue with one another take with him in here we all working together crew come help us from the maintenance because hey we all working together stop that foolishness right now big old fella told like that he looked around at me he said he's a what'd you say I said stop that foolishness with that guy let's get on get this work done it's 110 degrees out here and I'm watching y'all let's get this work done now I guess you the only preacher you're the only Christianity I said I'm the only Christian that's on fire must be I said because it's hot out here and you're all acting up and we got a job to do let's get it done now he's a preacher they told me you was a rough fella said I I said look at that man I used to be rough in the world I said God is good let's get this thing together and both of them look at me the little guy and the big guy and he said well we better go and get this done as y'all come over to help us camera this line let's get let's get work done and then he come and shake my hand and hit me on the back he said boy I tell you I said I would have been out here another hour with y'all with this foolishness I say love one another love one another no matter what they do they're spitting your face they slap you love them anyway because that is Jesus if Jesus wouldn't have loved them that did him at the cross he would have come down from the cross and all of us would be here in vain we'd be like Buddha and online Confucius and all them other gods Indian lady my neighborhood she like to talk to me and we start talking about Jesus and then she starts saying his son Jesus the moon Jesus and I said something my Minds you better get away from this lady here the cow Jesus they ground Jesus they Reign Jesus that's holy minute here now we're gonna live too far I said Jesus is his word and his life is the power of God into you and if that power resides into you the same power that's in that blood that shared 2 000 years ago that same blood has not lost any power it's got the power to save today as it did then when he was at Calvary and if he would have come off the cross you and I would be lost but he stood there and they whipped him and they beat him and they stabbed him in the side and the Bible said blood and water ruled out of me glory to God it was to sanctify the Old Testament Saints because they're about to be a resurrection and that second Ministry that second feeling of the Holy Ghost is to give you power to change from martial to immortality to get us out of here but you must get the fresh weed first before you can get the second wave he said If any man be in Christ he's a new creation old things that pass away behold All Things become new so now we're looking for the second anointing the unction of the holy ghost that comes upon the believer to Quicken him from Mortal to immortality so we can get out of here I know y'all don't want to stay here I know y'all don't want to stay here in the heart the soul lives in the heart and you believe from your heart people don't get religion in their head by book knowledge you get religion in Your Heart by an experience in your heart and the heart will always agree with the Bible but the head will reason and the Bible said that we cast down the reasoning we cast down all reasoning see now the hidden life is where you are eating it's where you are abiding I told the church a couple weeks ago I said this is what I want y'all to do I want y'all to read one or two chapters every day pray every day and I've seen the results already we get so busy that we can't read a chapter a day and you can't pray every day because a job uh this right here this little demon right here that's a little Spirit right there you use it for what you need to use it for and put it down if you pray as much as you got this in your hand this church will blow the roof or blow off you brother Simmons I had people coming all over out of the other states coming to get healed if we pray as much as we read this thing in look at this I clicked the Bible in the morning going to work and they want to give me five or ten ads for it cut on I said Lord have mercy distractions it's where you are abiding is where you are keeping yourself if you keeping yourself in the love of God and meditating on the word get quiet the hidden life Christ the hidden life in there says it's where you are abiding get quiet before God and watch God have a metamorphosis change in your life something will take place get away from the crying from the television from the noise and watch won't God begin to reveal to you the things that I help you to grow in Christ I said Lord I don't like to grow because every time you're growing you're going through something you don't grow why everything's going good you grow while you're suffering while you go through trials while you go through tests while you go through this thing that's what helps you to grow amen when somebody dislike you somebody hit you in the back somebody backstab you somebody talk about you you're growing and I tell the church if you get mad when somebody talk about you they even talk about dead people but dead people don't do what they can't talk back if you're dead in Christ you don't talk back you don't think about it no more people talk about dead people but if you if you grow and you love that person that talk about you God is going to take you to the next level when I was a little boy we had a commercial when his TV went off it said this is a test but American broadcast system this is only a test so you fighting the devil out there and this is only a test and you come to defeat him take David you might don't have a sword in your hand but your prayer life and your faith will take his sword and cut his head off get where God is abide where Christ is get in that secret place and watch the Power of Brad Tabernacle and Faith Tabernacle begin to explode because guess what the darker it get it means what if the Devils get the world is getting darker that means we got to shine brighter John 15 and 26. but when the Comfort has come who I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear Witness because ye have been with me from the beginning see if you've been with Jesus from the beginning you're going to Bear witness of the Resurrection see that's why we can commune with him because we've been with him from the beginning so now a thought a germ an expression God's thought so if God thought about you you in his eternal thoughts God don't have a thought that's not Eternal he's a Judas we're not with him but you were with him in the Lamb's Book of Life and God is going to send trouble with your weight until he gets you into the place that a metamorphosis did taking place in your life trouble gonna continue to come until you obey God's word and God can help you to grow church we in adoption season with winnowing time his wintering time is not a highly a Christian out there you put you in adoption season Hebrews 8. and I'm gonna close Hebrews 8. Hebrews 8 and 1. and I might have to go to seven it is now of the things which we have spoken this is the Sun we have such and high priest who is set at the right hand of God the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man what's that true Tabernacle it's you and I we are the two Tabernacles of God it wasn't faith it wasn't virtue it wasn't Temperance it's the seventh Tabernacle was the Bible said it cannot even be complete without us this is the true Tabernacle you and I in laosia what happened Satan came in God In the Garden of Eden and trick God's bride now God has got his bride in Satan Eden which is laodicea you are the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitching not man Forever high priestess is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices whereof it is a necessity that this man has somewhat also to offer for if he were on Earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law saith unto the example and Shadow of heavenly things and Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle for sin saith he that thou maketh all things according to the pattern showed thee in the mouth but now have he obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much more also he is a mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon better promises for if that first Covenant was faultless then should no place have been sought for the second for finding fault with them he said behold the Deeds come saith the Lord I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with the fathers and the date and I took them out of the land of Egypt because he continued not in my Covenant and I regarded him not said the law see the priesthood in the Old Testament was made a certain way offer but God said I'm going to make a new thing this priesthood that he came under not that Catholic priesthood because he had for no father mother but this priesthood was going to be a priesthood of worship worship is going to take you from salvation from a sinner to Salvation worship gonna take you from sin from justification and sanctification from sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's going to take you into the Holy Ghost Holiness of Holiness Jesus was showing that this bride is going to be true Tabernacle by wish when you offer a sacrifice unto God reading or praying you're going to completely yield yourself to the power and presence of Jesus that is what the bride does she yields herself to the house the husband know what the wife know what the husband wants done with the word Jesus know that you know what he wants done with it that's why the Bible said we have such a great high priest which is passing to the heavens Jesus the son of God let us not glory to God let us not falter let us not be weary but let us go into the wholeness of Holiness by the blood of Jesus Hebrews 10 and 19. we're going into the holy place by the blood of Jesus it's not nothing we've done but what Jesus has done for us we can't glory in nothing but in the cross of Calvin now look what he says for this Covenant that I make with the house of Israel said the Lord I put my laws into their minds and write them in their hearts and I will be to them and God and they shall be to me and people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor every man is brother saying know the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest and I will be merciful unto their unrighteousness and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more so don't worry about somebody remembering your sins Jesus remember no more you pass through Paul said let me go from glory to glory even by the spirit of Christ and for I will be merciful to their righteous unrighteousness and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more in that saith he a New Covenant I've made the first old now that which the chaith and wax his old is ready to vanish away 7 and 22 I'm closing by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better Testament see Melchizedek had no father no mother he met Abraham returning from the slaughter the Kings and he blessed him and he gave a tenth of all the spoil that he had thank the Lord for Melchizedek Ministry but Melchizedek Ministry couldn't save us they had to come another high priest and his name is Jesus and he passed through the heavens Jesus the son of God that's why the Bible said lay all your sins and iniquities upon him when Jesus died the Bible said he bypassed sex desire he wasn't born like we was born because Job 14 said man that's born of a woman deserve a few days and full of trouble even though the woman the man came by the woman woman has to come back by the man and if you're born of God you're born by the man Christ Jesus but if you're born of the devil and you stay there you're born by a woman now but anyone that's born of a man is born again anyone that's born of a woman is going to hell his glory to God the man was by the woman not a Woman by the man now glory to God if you understand what I'm saying if the man Christ Jesus had birthed you your birth into the body as First Corinthians 13 says in John 3 he told Nicodemus you must be born again not of just water not of just Lord Jesus Christ but you must be born by the spirit and if your birth of the spirit now you are baptized into the body of Christ in in the body of Christ there's nothing but the word in there now look what it says and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death so those priests couldn't continue but you have an everlasting priesthood but this man this was no ordinary man is what no ordinary man he's a Rose of Sharon he's a lily of the veil he's a Bright Morning Star but this man Oh Glory to God if I can exalt this man if I can get weak like John the Baptist this man John said I must decrease and he must increase I think the ministry right now should be in decreasing and as we decrease about what we've done and who we are I think he'll increase John said let me decrease and let him increase John said the bride groom has the bride first John 20 Saint John 1 and 29 the bride groom has the bride John was sending them to go with him and they locked John in prison and John began to look and his ego I was dimming over and the disciples came to him and said John John told him said ask him if this is him or shall we look for another and Jesus told John's disciples you follow me just a little while you see the death the death he or the leper's cleanser the blind eyes are open and they went back and told John what they saw and what he done Jesus said if you believe me for the very work sake I don't believe that I'm marrying Joseph's son I'm the Son of God made flesh that your sins might be eradicated in my blood but this man because he continued ever having an unchangeable priesthood see the Old Testament has a priesthood that was changing the priest went in in the Old Testament had a chain on him and a bell made a sound holy to the Lord and if he didn't approach God right they drug him out under the curtain did and sometimes we come into church every Sunday with problems instead of knowing that Jesus can heal us every Sunday from in and out we come with problems and don't know all we got to say As Romans 10 and 9 said if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thou art that God has raising from the dead thou shall be saved with the heart with the heart man believe it with the mouth confessions made unto salvation so once you confess to Jesus and you believe it in your heart that he can do it it's done just read the scriptures about the Fig Tree Peter said the Fig Tree we just passed it Lord are we coming back by and it's withered away he said if you believe Mark 11 and 22 said if you believe you see all things but you got to believe you got to trust and believe and the only thing can bring that type of faith in believing is the Holy Ghost you've got to get Beyond the Veil when life begins that's what brings the faith of the Holy Ghost back there if you got a sickness get back down it's gone just like that just like that it's gone look what he says unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able to save them under the utter moves that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such and high priests became who you and I for such and high priest became us and if you're a priest that means you in service not a woman preaching now you in service to offer spiritual sacrifices unto God which is your reasonable service see Jesus saying it's your reasonable story but if you don't want to do it you don't have to do it but it's your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God session for such and high priest became us who is wholly harmless undefiled separate from Sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those High priests to offer up sacrifices for first his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself so if he did one sacrifice to save us you only need one sacrifice to be saved for the lawmaker of men High priests which have infirmities but the word of old which is was since the law make of the son who is consecrated forevermore that's our preached this morning I'ma stay with what I say I'm closing I got 20 more scriptures but such an high priest became us identified Christ of all ages and when you identified with Christ there's something take place in you a metamorphosis take place in you death takes place in you and Christ is Resurrected and when he's resurrected all power in Heaven and Earth Jesus said in Matthew 20 and 19 is given unto me in him was the fullness of God first Colossians 1 and 26 in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead body so you are complete in him which is the head of all principalities all powers all things in him so when you eat him you above all principalities you're above sickness you're above trouble you're above trials but you got to be in him in him but first it must be Romans 10 and 9. you must confess and not only confession you must believe what you say and it shouldn't be your belief it should be God and but it's where you are keeping yourself if you're keeping yourself in the most holy place all things are possible to them that believe God bless you let us bow if you want prayer you can come as the brother sane to brother Gordon sings if you want prayer you can come if you say Lord I don't know where I'm placed at in the Tabernacle but I want to be in the most holy place you can lift your hands where you stand and we'll pray with you or if you want to come up we'll pray with you the Lord I I've been going up and down and in and out and I'm not consistently reading my Bible every day I'm not consistently praying every day but I want to get closer to you you can come or lift your hands Lord I know that this world is coming to a close they won't let you preach after a while unless you see the mark in your hand or your forehead Lord let us make a fool advantage of our opportunity in Christ Lord the ministry preaching sweating tears praying and crying that Souls would come to the kingdom people would continue to grow in Christ Lord help your people this morning what bothered us last year shouldn't be bothering us this year the things we went through last year we shouldn't go through this year God is going to keep the tests upon you until you overcome it said Lord help me to overcome by the blood of Jesus by New and Living Way which is consecrated for us through the Veil Lord help the little church in Camden Lord we've been having visitors every week Lord I pray you help people help us to say and do the things that are needed for salvation help us to do and say the things that drive us to the Holy Ghost the very presence in life of Jesus Christ in US not a denomination but your word Jesus is the truth this morning you can accept him or reject him but I believe you will receive accept him this morning into your heart and say God help me God work with me God have mercy on me Ephesians 1-5 says God who is rich in Mercy Lord you've had mercy on us and it's going to take more Mercy Lord put our lives to get us where we need to be but Lord help us depress toward the mark of the High Calling of God is in Christ Jesus church is just not a form of fashion but you coming to see the mighty king this morning and every morning Sunday morning and every morning you wake up say lord it's another day that I can tell somebody about your goodness I can tell somebody about your grace and God let me be so anointed and on fire that Souls would come to the kingdom and not to a man for I thank you this morning for pastor Simmons inviting us up pray you bless him and in his absence his son let your name be glorified bless the Tent Revival that somebody might be saved somebody might draw closer to you that somebody might see the power of the anointed word to take them from Darkness to light and through the Tabernacle you're the most holy place Lord is our prayer this morning have mercy upon your people have mercy upon my life continue to help me to surrender and heal and humble my life that Jesus the high priest can take full control and say what he want to say and do what he want to do into my heart in to my heart come into my Heart Lord Jesus come in today come in to stay come My Heart Lord Jesus Jesus into my heart into my heart come into my heart Lord Jesus Jesus come in today [Music] Jesus amen amen I mean I enjoyed the sermon today I tell you amen you know we we got a lot to give God to praise the glory for amen you know just just a minute testimonies and even just looking around us the church hey man we got we got to give God the praise the glory for what he's done for how he's just touched Our Lives even our family lives even different people here I'm just looking around and seeing amen you know God God just has a way just to be able to touch our lives and and even as brother Carl was preaching I was just thinking I said Lord you know I'm thinking of my testimonies in in different situation of how God has brought me through you know oftentimes we want God to just stop the situation but sometimes God is not going to stop this situation but God is going to get in the fire with us amen like he did with Shadrach Meshach and Abednego he didn't just stop the fire he didn't just you know say I'm just going to put out the fire but he got in the flame with him amen and that's what God sometimes do with our lives he get in the flame with us he get through our child 1000 tribulations but he comes in us and he he reveals himself in US amen and he gets in our fire with us amen it's all hearts and Minds clear amen let us pray Lord God thank you so much for your word Lord and Lord just take and bury that word deep inside our hearts Lord God that we'll be able to Manifest this word that we heard Lord touch the Lord God every heart that is here Lord touch every need that is here right now Lord God this Lord God bless the going forth of the temp Revival Lord that Lord we want people to be saved
