[music] Amen. Let us bow. Lord Jesus, we thank you for allowing us to come in your house this morning. Lord, we ask that you just come down and continue to move in our midst this morning. Lord, you said when two or three are gathered in my name that you would be there so we know that you're in our midst. Lord, we ask that you just move and Lord move us out of the way. Lord, anoint our lips, anoint our body, Lord, and anoint us that we may give you all the glory and all the honor and the praise. Lord, to say something that would meet the needs of your people this morning. In Jesus name [music] we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you got your Bibles this morning, we'll turn to the book of Luke, chapter 7. And when you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All righty. And it reads, "Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he ended he entered into Capernaum and a certain centurion servant who was dear unto him was sick and and ready to die. And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant." And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying that he was worthy for them he should for whom he should do this. For he loved our nation, and he has built us a synagogue. Then Jesus went with them, and when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof. Where wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee, but say in a in a word, and my servant shall be healed? For I am also a man set under authority, having unto me soldiers. And I say unto one, go, and he goeth, and to another come, and he cometh, and to my servants, do this, and he doeth it. When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, know not in Israel. And they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole that have been sick. Amen. God bless the reading of this word. You may be seated. Amen. This morning, I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled the unmoveable object versus the unstoppable force. The unmovable object versus the unstoppable force. And I was thinking about this and I was reading the story and and I thought about it. I said, you know, this servant, he might have been there was no other hope for him. He had gotten to a point that that his obstacle there was no other hope for him to overcome it. The only way that he had he could overcome it was by the power of God. He had to have someone that believed that God could do it. He had to have someone that would reach out in faith and believe that God could conquer this obstacle that was in front of him. I was reading and I was thinking about the definition. What is an obstacle? It's a thing that blocks one's way or prevents or hinders progress. Many times in life, you'll run into obstacles. You'll run into it whether it's a class, whether it's a person, whether it's a job, whether it's is what you're trying to figure out what to do next with your life. All of these are obstacles, but sometimes you get to obstacles that seem like they're unmovable. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that you can do about them. There's nothing that you can talk to anybody or say about it. These obstacles, they be they seem like they're unmovable. Well, on the other side of the obstacle, there's another force that's working behind it that comes against that combat this obstacle obstacle. And when you see it, you'll think about it and you'll say, "Well, this thing seems to be unmovable, but this force is unstoppable." Cuz when God starts moving, it's unstoppable. So, you got to you got to something that doesn't want to move and something that says, "I can't be stopped." Well, it seems like a paradox to some people, but eventually you have to realize that one has to give way to the other. One has to step aside and say, you know what, this this force is too powerful or the obstacle is too great. Well, when you start to look at it, this centurion, he realized that, you know what, this obstacle is not too great for the force that's going to come against it. When I go to God, I believe that he doesn't even have to come to me. That someone might have said, well, the sickness might have been the their unmovable obstacle. their sickness. This man's sickness might have been it looked like this was the end of his road. This was the end of his journey. There was nothing else that could be done. So he said, "You know what? I'm going to try one more thing." Sometimes you got to get to the point that you come to the end of your obstacle. You tried everything else. You tried to jump over it. You tried to dig under it. You tried to go around it. You tried to go to the left or the right, but it wouldn't move. You can't figure out how to get past it. But I ask you, did you try Jesus? &gt;&gt; Because that's the force that can move the object right on out of the way. That's the force that can come to the object and say and speak to the object and it moves instantaneously. But if it doesn't move instantaneously, you got to believe that when you spoke to it with the faith behind it that it will move. It doesn't matter whether you see it today or tomorrow, it's going to move. Because even though it might have seemed like it was unmovable, there was a power. But there was a force behind it, behind the words that you spoke in the faith, behind the word of God that when you spoke to it, it had to move because God said, "My word can't return it to me void." So it's not you speaking the word. It's not your lips speaking it. It's that you're speaking it and the power that God gave it and speaking to it that it would move. And that you're for sure that the words that I'm speaking, Lord, is not my words, but it's your words. It's what you put in your word and you told me to speak it. So if you told me to speak it, I got to have faith that it's going to do something. &gt;&gt; I got to have faith that what I'm speaking is going to move. I got to have faith that this obstacle, even though it seems unmovable, I don't know how it's going to move, but I know it's going to move. &gt;&gt; And when it moves, it's going to dissipate directly out of the way, that I don't even have to see you come. I know that when you spoke the word, something happened. I know that when I spoke the word, something took place. I might not see it today, tomorrow, next week, but I know something had to take place because I spoke your word and I believe that when I sent it forth, it was going to do what I asked you to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that's when people they started to look at they look more at the obstacle than they look at the force that's behind them. &gt;&gt; They look more at the obstacle than they trust in the force that's leading them and guiding them and and allowing them to live each and every single day. They're looking more at the problem than they are looking and saying that I don't know what the solution is, but I know there is a solution. I know that the solution is coming forward. And I know eventually the solution is going to show forth. See, I don't have to understand. I don't necessarily have to understand the problem. I got to un I got to trust the one that's teaching me how to overcome the problem. say I got to trust a teacher that's allowed me to go forth and see if you go to school and you and you studying something you are studying at some point in time you have to believe that the teacher can teach you well enough that you can pass the test now some people and they're not great teachers &gt;&gt; so you have to find supplemental help &gt;&gt; to allow you to pass the test cuz the test is going to come regardless of whether you wanted to come or not whe whether you understand the subject or not, the test is going to come. And just like in life, God allows the test come whether you think that you ready or not. You might say, "I'm not ready for that." But God has sent it anyway. Cuz in the process of it, you might not think you were ready, but God had been preparing you for the test to come. And he had been allowing you to go through this and go through that. And you wondering why and why this, but it was all in preparation for the test that was to come. It was all about, you know, I'm leading and guiding you around this so that one day when you face this test, you know that I'm able to overcome it. I'm giving you and building your faith to a point that you can believe that God is able to do it. It doesn't matter what this one or that one says or how they look at your situation, you know that God can overcome it for you. So when you in the classroom and and you have to believe in the teacher that the teacher is going to provide you with the materials to take the test. Even if they don't teach it to you well, they'll provide you with the materials to to take the test. And so at some point in time, you have to have faith and trust in someone. Whether that's your classmates, whether that's your teacher, whether that's the supplemental instructor, whether that's the tutor, you have to have faith in someone. Because when you start to put that faith, you have to believe that they're going to give me the tools that I need to overcome. &gt;&gt; And just like you can put it in someone, this teacher or this or this tutor or this like that, why not trust in God that made all the things that was ever created? &gt;&gt; Why not go to him and say, "Lord, they may not can explain it to me, but I know you can. I know that you can provide a way that I might not understand, but I I've heard testimonies of people said they took a test and the night before they took the test, they dreamed the whole test and the answer to the test. It's one thing to see the test. It's another thing to get the answers to the test. I said, man, that that's that's powerful right there. And and mind you at this they it was so powerful they didn't know it was one of the hardest classes, one of the hardest tests you could ever take. They they you know sometimes when Lord show you something, you get so excited. You get so excited. Oh my goodness, it can't be this this way. But they the Lord allowed them to see the test and the answer. They didn't even get to finish it, but made the highest score in the class. That's what God can do when you have faith and trust in him. when you believe in them and say, "Lord, I believe that the impossible is possible. I believe that even though I can't explain it, I know that you can do the things for me. I have to trust and believe that Lord, the way that you going to provide is the best way for me to go." And I believe that, you know, this might be an unmovable obstacle, but I know that the force that's coming behind it and the faith that I believe in is going to be allow me to overcome this obstacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. said, "Nothing is impossible with God." &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible with God. And and I thought about the story in second Kings 2 Kings chapter chapter 2. And I thought it was fitting. And we know the story of how Elijah, he goes up and the end of his ministry is over and God takes him on this journey. as he's leaving leaving the earth, he takes him on this journey and he goes and on the journey a lot of people was going with him. Then eventually he came to Jordan. He told everybody, "No, y'all stay right here. Y'all stay right here." But there was one person that said, "No, I'm not going to stay right here. I'm going with you to the end of the journey." And Elisha, he and Elisha, he said, "No, I'm going with you." Well, when Elijah came to Jordan, he took his mantel off and he smoked the water and he and he believed that when he smoked the water, the water was going to dissipate. So, it happened and the waters dissipated and they walked off on on dry land on across on dry land in verse 8 and it reads and it says, "And Elijah took his mantel and wrapped it together and smoked the waters and they were divided divided hither and thither. so that the two went over on dry ground. I wanted to show you so you see it. But when we skip down to verse verse 13 and 14, if you go further on the story, which you can read later on, you read the whole chapter and Elijah goes up. He's taken up in the fiery chariot and and God takes him off to earth. But he left one thing. He left his mantle behind. his mantle was basically his coat if you if you don't know but it was basically his coat and it fell off when he when he took was taken up in the chariot and in verse 13 and and Elisha he he he also he took up also the mantle of Elijah. So Elisha he was left behind and he take up the coat verse 13 that Elisha fell from him and went back and stood on by the bank of Jordan. See, Elisha had made it across the river. But now he had to go back. And Elijah was no more there. Elijah had gone on. God had took him. But Elisha had to cross back over that river. And he had come back to this thing that someone said, "You know what? I don't know how you going to get past that." You sometimes you tell people what you're going through and it's like, "Oh, I don't know how you going to get through that." Or they'll say, "You know what? Well, that that's your story, not mine." Or they'll say, "Oh, that's your problem. I'm glad God ain't give me that. But but when he got to there, he had in verse 14, it was striking that he said he took up the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoked the waters and he said, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" &gt;&gt; See, he was looking for the same God that was with Elijah to be there with him. &gt;&gt; He was looking for the same God that brought mama and daddy and all those through to be there for him. He was looking for the same God that pastor and this one might have talked about, but he wanted God to show up right there for him and to allow him to cross this river. See, sometimes you got to lean on and say, "Lord, I've heard testimonies, but now I need my own testimony. Lord, I've heard others speak about you, but Lord, now I need you to do it for me. Lord, I've heard others overcome unsurmountable obstacles. Come off of drugs, come off of this, that, but Lord, I need you to do it for me." Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not good enough for me to hear the stories. It's not good enough for me to see the things. Elisha saw it with his own eyes. It wasn't good enough for him. He said, "God, I need you to part Jordan River just like you did for him for me." &gt;&gt; He didn't want to lean on nobody's testimony but the one that God was going to give him. So he said, "Where is the God of Elijah?" He didn't say, "Where is Elijah?" He said, "Where's the God of Elijah?" He said, "I'm trusting in the the same one that did it for Elijah. I'm trusting in him to do it for me." And sometimes you got to take that faith, Lord. I've heard you do it for others. So, I'm trusting that you're the same God yesterday, today, and forever. And I'm trusting that you're going to do it for me. I don't know how. I don't know why, but I Lord, I'm trusting in you cuz I understand that you can do all things. And there's nothing left that you haven't seen. There's nothing that's a surprise for you. There's nothing that I can't understand or overcome because you've given me overcoming power. &gt;&gt; See, I got to understand the God that's behind me, that's pushing me forward, that's allowing me to live this life, that's allowing me to wake up every day, every morning, every step that I take and see if he's the same God that can do all of that, I know that he can overcome the thing that's in front of me. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, that wasn't the end of the story. God was just trying to He was just trying to say, "I got the same faith Elijah got. &gt;&gt; The same faith when he took it. I got that same faith, God. So, I'm expecting you to show up just like you did for him. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; If Elijah didn't trust in the God of If Elisha didn't trust in the God of Elijah, it wouldn't have parted for him. &gt;&gt; If he didn't have the same faith, it wouldn't have parted for him. But when he came there, he had that same faith. That's why he said, "Where is the God of Elijah?" &gt;&gt; Because I know that that's the one true living God that can part the red he parted the Red Sea and then he parted it for him. So I got the same faith. Not only have I seen it done, I want God to do the same thing for me. &gt;&gt; And see, I started to think about another story, a familiar story of a man named Gideon. And in Judges chapter 6, and I won't read the whole thing, it goes over three chapters. Judges chapter 6 through through 8, there was there was these enemies that was coming through that came against Israel. And when they came against Israel, they was all they was harassing them for years. And it was because of Israel's fault. Now, did they they they didn't do right in the sight of God. They they they was they had done some wrong things. So, God allowed the enemies to come against them. In verse in chapter 6, I read some of it and starting in verse one. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. Just imagine fighting your going your enemy fighting you and winning most of the battles for seven years. Now seven in the Bible it means completion. So after seven the the the eight means a new beginning. So seven was the year of completion. And he said in verse two, "And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel, which means they won. And because of of the Midianites of the Midionites, the children of Israel made them dense, which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds. See, the enemy was winning so well that that the children of God decided that they was going to hide. This was the best course of action for me. You know, I'm not going to tell anybody about Jesus. I don't want nobody to know that I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go out here and witness to nobody because I don't see God delivering me from anything. I I can't tell anybody that God is real because I don't, you know, it's it's those battles that they was fighting when the enemy was attacking them that they decided, you know, I still believe in God, but you know, I I can't witness about it. because I don't see it. If God ain't deliver me, he said he would deliver me from all these things. And let's read on down. [sighs] And he said in verse three, "So it was when Israel had sown that the Midionites came up and the Malachites and the children of the east, even they came up against them, and they camped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou came up come unto Gaza, and left no substance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ashes." See, when they came and they took they took all the things that might have said blessings. They waited till they did all the hard work, all the hard labor, all the studying. Ever ever ever ever studied all night, all day for weeks and still failed. I've been there. It a It ain't no fun. And and and then you have to have a resolve that's deep down inside of you. It's like, Lord, if you put me on this path, &gt;&gt; thank you. If you put me on this path &gt;&gt; and I believe that you sent me on this path, &gt;&gt; I got to believe that you're going to provide a way out of it. I &gt;&gt; I don't have to understand it, but I got to believe that you're going to provide a way out of it. and said said, "For they came up with their cattle in their tents, and they came as grasshoppers from multitude, for both they and their camels were without number, and they entered into the land to destroy it." And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord. And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of the oppressed that oppressed you, and dra them out before you, and I gave you their land. And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God. Fear not the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell, but ye have not obeyed my voice. And said, and there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak tree that was in Ofra, that pertained unto Joash the Aizerite, the son of and his son Gideon, threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Midianites. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him, the Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor. And and Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, then why is all this befallen us?" How many times may God come to you and say something to you or the word is preached and and you go to God with a question? Say, "God, well, I know that you said that I I'm healed. I'm delivered. But then why did you give me the sickness in the first place? &gt;&gt; Lord, I know that you said I'm victorious. Then why did you give me the test in the first place? And Gideon, he went to if the Lord be with us, then why then is all this befalling us? And where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, did not the Lord bring us out of Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of the Midianites. See, Gideon was just on the journey. He was looking at an obstacle that he couldn't see no way of overcoming. He was looking at a at a test that he couldn't see no way that he was going to pass it. He was looking at something that might that was insurmountable in the moment because he was a prisoner of the moment. He had heard many stories, but those stories wasn't doing him no good. He had heard many testimonies, but those testimonies, he was like, "I've heard the testimonies, but God, uh, that ain't doing nothing for my situation. That's not doing nothing for what I'm going through right now. That's not doing nothing for what what I'm facing right now." He said, "Where be all the miracles? Where be all the signs and wonders? Where's the God that they always talked about?" And then the angel showed them forth that, you know what? I am a true servant of the Lord. I came to you with the message that God is going to use you to deliver my people. And so and once once he realized that you know what this wasn't for play or for show. This was the real servant of God that came and spoke these things to him. He got faith. He realized you know what this is the same God from yesterday that they always spoke about. This is the same God and he's going to deliver us out of out of the hand of the Midianites. Not only did that, he he got such a testimony that others decided, you know what? I can join forces with you. I believe just like you. And so many people start joining the the the army. Oh my goodness, everybody got faith now. See, sometimes it only takes one to believe. &gt;&gt; It only takes one to believe. It only takes one to step out in faith to ignite the whole place. Ignite the whole church. Ignite everyone around you to believe that all things are possible. Even though we don't understand how we going to defeat the enemy, we going out in faith because we know that the enemy is defeated. &gt;&gt; There was so many people that decided to join the army that God said, "No, I can't use all of them. I didn't call all of them to go out in in there. Maybe they going to be more of a hindrance than a blessing." &gt;&gt; He said, "I got to bring it on down." So, he gave him a test and and certain people passed the test unbeknowingly and some people didn't. That was okay. It wasn't that anybody was supposed to be excluded. God just had the select few that he wanted. He just had the select few that he was going to use to allow them to overcome the enemy and said they came up to the army and then they had many things that happened. They had many things that happened when they came up to the to the army and and when they when when they when when they got around the enemy near the enemy. But I wanted to show you in chapter 7 and verse 6, he said when he gave him the test and he chose which men was going to be there, he said the number of them that lap putting their hands to their mouths were 300 men, but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. See, that's when God, he separated them from the many from the few. He separated the many from the few and he said, "You know what? I'm going to allow you to do something that might have seemed impossible. I'm going to take these 300 and we going to defeat all the Midianites. Now, I started reading and I and I got got really enthralled in the story. So, if you go down here, just to put it in context in chapter 8 and verse 10, I'm going to show you how many people actually was with them with the Midianites. He said, "Now Za [snorts] and Zamana were at Kor and their host that were with them were about 15,000 men. All that were left of all the host of the children of the east. From there fell 120,000 men that drew the sword." God used 300 to take out 120,000. 300 to take out 120,000. Now you talk about, you know, the enemy is quadruple, triple that whatever you want to use. That's a whole lot more than than than you be and everybody it ain't 300 people might be in here. So is 300 to take out 120,000. You said, "How is that possible?" Well, first of all, God let them think that it was a greater host of enemy coming against them than what was at the 300. God used the used confusion. He allowed them to take out each other versus taking out the enemy. And they wasn't coming against Israel. They was taking out each other. Some of them probably ended up losing their lives because other was trying to run to get away. You know, God used anything. Sometimes you don't know how God is going to take care of your enemy or take the obstacle out of the way, but sometimes God will let them be confused and let you go right on along. Said that that's what he used for them. And he allowed them to defeat the enemy. But when they when when they got a little bit of victory, they wasn't satisfied. Gideon, they killed the two princes, but they wasn't satisfied. When they killed the two princes, they went on. They said, "We haven't destroyed our enemy yet." This ain't all that God gave us. We got a little bit of victory, but we want the rest of it. He went and called his friends and he said, "Y'all y'all meet them at the river right down there and y'all take care of some of the enemy." Well, when he got to the friends, they got mad at him. Said, "Why you didn't invite us to the fight in the first place?" Cuz God ain't tell me to do that. &gt;&gt; They got mad at him. Some people say, "Why you didn't get me to pray?" Well, God, when he directed me to ask for prayer, he didn't direct me to ask everybody. He said, "Go to this one and that one." And sometimes you can't be offended when God uses this one or that one, but doesn't use you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, God has a purpose and a plan for what he's trying to get for it and what he's trying to do. &gt;&gt; See, Gideon, he went and told them, and after that, he said, "Listen, y'all took out all these, what y'all mad at?" They said, "Oh, yeah, you're right." So, they went on they but but the fight wasn't over. Gideon and his 300, they kept chasing. Well, when they got when they got to a certain place, they got they were hungry and they have been fighting all day long and they have been fighting and they kept going and they kept going and they got to some certain places and they and they went and they asked for some help. Many of times you think some people are your friends and they not cuz when you go to them for help, they be like, "I don't know you." They can't remember the times that you gave them help. They can't remember the times that you answered the phone late at night. They can't remember the times all that. They just are in their season of what what they call they they seem to be in a prosperous season. They don't remember the lowly moments when you were giving them encouragement that God can still make it and do all these things. So they was they was like, you know what? Nah, we ain't going to help you. But they didn't understand that it wasn't Gideon that was talking. Gideon said, you know what? You don't help us. Guess what? But we coming back and we going to destroy y'all too. &gt;&gt; So they went on on the journey. They went to some other people and they got the same spirit. It jumped from them to the next people and they said, "You know what? We ain't going to help y'all either." He said, "Don't worry about it. We come back to take care of y'all, too." So when he got done, he was able to defeat those enemies and also the people that said that that they thought that they could run to and have help from. He took care of all of them. See, God will take care of your enemies, your fmies, and the people that you think are on your side, too. He'll show you exactly who they are. He'll let your eyes be open so you can see, hey, them ain't my real friends. He'll let you see, oh, you know what? I can't go confide in them. Oh, I can't go talk to them like I thought I could. Because God is sometimes opening your eyes that you can go further in him, but you can't take everybody along with you. You can't go on and you can't say, "You know what? I'm going to take this one and that one." God has his journey for you and for you alone. He had that journey for for Gideon and those 300 men. If he would have took some others, they might have got tired and decided to quit. &gt;&gt; But he had them cuz he knew that they was going to last the whole journey. He knew that they was going to continue to fight on until they got complete and total victory over all their enemies that could come against them. He knew that, you know what, this obstacle that they were fighting against, they didn't have to see it no more after today. As long as they kept fighting and kept going, and they believe that God could do what he said he would do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said in verse 28 and verse 8, he said, "Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more, and the country was in quietness 40 years in the days of Gideon." God did such a work that that people, you know what, they said, "We ain't even going to fight them no more." We saw what God did for them. We saw the 300 defeat the 120, 140,000 people. We not going to fight them cuz if that's what God could do with 300. Just imagine if they got on one accord and started to fight together. Just imagine if they decided to band together and believe all with one accord that God could defeat their enemies. Just imagine, it don't matter how big our army is. It ain't greater than the God that they got allowing them to come against us. &gt;&gt; So when they realize that and they could stand on that and believe that then they can move on and and they could fight and they could go on. They said, "You know what? We going to give them peace &gt;&gt; because the one that's leading them believe and that God is with them." Said that that they realized that God was there and he was able to to bring them out. He said the prophet of God I was reading and he said he was talking about Israel and he was talking about he said but when he come forth and fight against them and taken from the from the people he was talking about Moses going into the children and going into the land uh the promised land and he said God told him and told Israel or Israel vowed to God if he would deliver the king into his hand that he'd utterly destroy the the man. And it's and that's a type that gay. If God will give you the spirit, the Holy Spirit, utterly destroy the sin out of your life. Move on. Nothing can stop the church. They may call you a fanatic. They may call you call call you simply to pack a Bible. They may say that you're a holy roller or whatever they do, nothing's going to stand in God's church. She's moving towards Canaan. And if you don't, if you don't go, God's going to take them that will go. That's right. He that church there's nothing. It's an irresistible force. That's right. And God will move everything. &gt;&gt; He said, "And God will move everything." And I I believe that this morning that there's nothing that can stand in the way of those that believe in God. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can stand in your way if you trust in God. If you believe that God is able to do it, there's nothing that can stand in your way. There's no demon, no devil from hell that can say, "You know what? I got victory over you." No, you don't. Cuz God gave me the victory. It doesn't matter whether it's today or tomorrow that I see this victory, but God gave me the victory. So, I'm going to trust on it. I'm going to stand on it. I'm going to believe that when he died and shed his blood, that there was no demon in hell that could come against me, that could attack me, that could overcome me because I believe that God did it for me. &gt;&gt; And I can have faith. I can stand in it. Whenever the devil comes, I can point them back to that blood that was shed for me way back on Calvary. See, when I understand the words come off the pages and they have a meaning to me, &gt;&gt; they have a life that lives on all by itself that I realize that I'm covered by the blood that I'm covered under the blood that I'm standing I've been washed in that blood and God ain't come down. And if you and if you haven't gotten there, you need to get that relationship with God that you can stand on it. That you can stand on the word of God that you can stand in faith and say, "Lord, I don't know how. I don't know why, but I believe that you can do it for me." [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Said, "I'm not looking to my left or looking to my right. I'm trusting in the one that does all things. I'm trusting in the one that can remove the obstacles, that can overcome the test, that can overcome the the demons and devils of hell that might be fighting me every single day. &gt;&gt; So, I'm believing in the one the force that's the power of God. &gt;&gt; If you didn't know the force that I was talking about, it was the power of God. And when when when you understand that there's a power that God has that no devil in hell can touch, no devil in hell can overcome, no devil in hell can defeat, is already giving you the victory. All you have to do is believe. All you do is have to do is have faith that God is able. That God is able. That God is able. That God is able. That God is able. That God is able. [applause] And you don't move from that. You don't stay be persuaded any other way. But God is still able. And God is still able. Even when I fall, God is still able. Even when I stumble, God is still able. Even when I don't understand, God is still able. Even when it gets worse, God is still able. [applause] &gt;&gt; See, I'm believing in the God that can do the impossible. &gt;&gt; And and then sometimes you got to touch and agree with somebody else. Hey, come here and let's stand on it together that God is able to do this for me. &gt;&gt; See, I don't have to lean to my left or the right, but I may go to a brother and sister in prayer in confidence and say, "Stand on this with me. Let's watch and see what God will do. Let's stand on it. Let's watch and see what God will do." And then we sit there and we wait for God to do it. That when we get up in the morning, we say, "Lord, I know that you've already done it. Lord, the next day, I know that you already done it. and the next day. Lord, I know that you already done it. Lord, you didn't do it yesterday, but I believe you're going to do it today. Well, if you didn't do it to last night, I know you'll do it today. Lord, I'm standing on it. I'm standing on it. I'm building my faith, Lord. I believe. I'm not doubting. I'm not wavering. I'm not stumbling. I'm not falling. I'm believing that you're the God that's able to overcome. [applause] &gt;&gt; See, that's what I'm standing on. That's what I'm believing God to do. That's what I'm trusting God to do. I don't understand it, but I know he can do it. &gt;&gt; Let us all stand. &gt;&gt; See, that's what I'm trusting in. &gt;&gt; You wonder why I come to church and I can be happy is because I know that God has already done it for me. I know that God is already moving in my life. I know that I don't understand it, but I know he's doing the things. I may not see the complete thing, but I know that God is doing it. &gt;&gt; Oh, let us bow. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we come before you today, Lord, we know that we may face some unsurmountable obstacles. Lord Jesus, we know that we might face some things that we don't understand. But Lord, this morning, Lord, we want to step out on faith. Is there anybody here this morning said, "Lord, I have a need. I have something that I'm going through. I have a desire, Lord, that I I need you to come and do something in my life. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Lord, you see all the hands that are lifted, Lord. I lifted my hands cuz Lord, I have something that I have placed before you, Lord. And Lord, I'm standing today and Lord, Lord, I might not have done it before, but Lord, I'm going to step forward in faith, Lord, and said, Lord, if I don't even see it, I know that it's possible. Lord, I know that you're going to do it for me. And Lord, I'm asking today that you come and strengthen our faith. Lord, come and move in a mighty and a special way that we can testify and have testimonies of this day and what God has done for us. Lord, we're trusting and believing that you continue to move and you continue to touch every heart and every need and every heart's desire. Lord, that there's someone here that has not turned their life to you. If you say this morning, Lord, I'm not in this place, but Lord, I want to give my heart to you this morning. And that's your heart's desires. I wonder if you just lift your hands this morning. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. You see all the hands that are lifted, all the hearts that are open, Lord. We ask that you just come in and touch these hearts, Lord. And we ask that you come in and be the savior over their lives. that today after this day they can walk in a way that they can say that my life has been changed. Lord, those that are seeking and want to take the next step and say, "Lord, I want to be baptized." Lord, we ask that they just come and they just continue to give your life to them and continue to Lord work in them. And if there's one this morning that said, "I would like to be baptized this morning." If you want to lift your hands, Lord, you see all the hearts and the hands. And Lord, we ask that you continue to move. And Lord, we ask that you continue to build a deeper and closer relationship with you with each and every one of us this morning. Lord, we ask you continue to move in our midst. Touch our hearts. Touch our desires. Lord, in Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [applause] AMEN. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God is good.
