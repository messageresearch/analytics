listening in Lord may you Lord speak a word to them tonight Lord to draw your people back to you again father Lord bless the word now God in Jesus name that we commit ourself to you amen and amen the book of St John 17 a little thought that we was kind of working with back Maran amen so we try to share just a little bit of it excuse me let take John 17 let's start at the 18th verse let's cut it short as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee and they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me them also as thou has loved me father bless Thy word Sanctified in Jesus name amen may be seated I want to use for a little thought for a few minutes tonight as we on part three there in Marion the unity of the one God in the one Church the unity of the one God and the one Church my sub topic is being unified being unified amen we read St John and I cut it short because it's a lot to read but just to try to share a little bit of what is Unity what is unity and I know there be be different meanings that people use to clarify to them what Unity really is so I want to read a definition and talking about Christian Unity tonight the unity of the one God in the one Church it says Unity Christian Unity is the result of God bringing together people I like that God bringing together people of different ethics background and social classes into one body by faith in Jesus Christ it's God bringing the people together and we also talk about the church and that church there is not literally talking about any certain SE of um denominations or anything of that like that but that church there is talking about a many member bride Jesus said one place nobody can come to the father father but by me so there is a call that God gives out and the Bible say another place that many are called but only a few servant of God said that's the elect he said that are chosen and there are many people that hear and have heard and hearing the Gospel of Jesus Christ and it gives them an opportunity to either receive it or to reject it now that we know more about the things of God that we know now because we have a better understanding of the things of God we know now that the Ser of God was saying that God predestines in other words it's not man saving nobody but but it's really an act of God in other words it says that before you were even born there's already something in you laying there something to either to receive the word or either to reject it so when the Holy Ghost begin to move upon us and I believe that that's what we have been experiencing I believe somewhere in our Christian Life we heard the Holy Spirit speaking to us you heard a call though you may heard the uh a certain sermon God uses a man under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and he begin to love that man to speak the things the word of God to you and it's stranged how you know it could be a church full of people and you know everybody hear different things when it come to preaching some just hear good sermons some hear deep things or whatever they call Deep then there's something that hear God's voice and they can recognize that it's not just a preacher that it was something that that came real home to me and God knows how to reach every one of us I never can uh forget the time that I was in uh the county there in Maran and the young man came there preach from the Church of Christ you know came and we was at the service that night and I never can forget it cuz to me it was the beginning of something new to me you know I have been to churches I grew up in church all my life plenty of churches sometime seven days during the week growing up and going to church and hearing preaching and going to church but it's different when you hear something that actually catch you and it's not Mom it's not Daddy you know but it's God then personally visiting you and it has to be to each and every one of us though our parents you we raised our children we should do those things but it come to a place they must receive God themselves in other words they must have a personalized encounter with God visiting them themselves if not they'll be living off of your religion and salvation I want to say there salvation so as I sat there and listen to the young man preach and the Star Lake you know he Pro it was straight is the gate wide straight and my first time hearing anyone uh preach that sermon and to me as we were there and I was in a very bad condition in my life I I was in a a very low Place being taught about the things of God hearing even the things of God going to church like you ought to but it came a time that it got personal I just didn't hear a preacher I believe I heard from the voice of God and before even did the Lord had already done spoke to me about some things but you know and I I never really understood what that really means and there's a lot of things that you may hear you may not understand it fully but I want to let you know if it's really of God it will carry you further in your experience with God because I know what it's like just to be going to church I've been there I did that but going to church didn't change I brought forth a change in my life that I really needed and I always tell people you know it's good to come to church you ought to do that but when you come you must come expecting something I believe now we are a little further down the road I just been looking things you know life is is strange you know from coming down to mull in 27 years old and now I'm 61 I say Lord but the S where it went where it went 27 years old now I'm 61 Lord have mercy so I I'm looking at life and I hope that we we can kind of maybe share with you that like you said life is like a vapor many young people look at their life not by they in school and they got a future they're looking at this and that but before you know it you'll be 27 to 28 you'll be making choices making decisions but I want to let you know young people they're the greatest decision you ever can make above all your career and your that's good to have those things it's real good to have a the career but above all of that get God first you may even be successful that's good you may even be a multimillion that's good but get God first you will never ever regret that decision but here now we talking about the unity of the one God in one Church the servant Gospel called message Christ the ministry of God revealed he said God had a three-fold purpose and God was trying to always bring his people to a place of unity but every time God seemed to try to move on the people they seem to always get in their own selfish motives and they try to do it the way they want and then it be confusion it's chaos but God has a plan and a way that he does things and God way is is by his word and as long as we stay with the word and the things of God then we can be unified properly the Ser God it takes us as a renewing of our minds other words have he said let this mind being you that was in Christ see now God's way of leading his church is through the holy spirit that why he said you must be born again see without the holy I'm talking the real Holy Ghost now I believe the real Holy Ghost is will make all of us live the same way it's not two holy ghosts if it make one live right it'll make the other one live right if one be clean then all ought to be clean see because it's not any man doing it's the holy ghost moving inside of us he is the uh director we don't tell him what to do we just listen to what he said we don't question what God said we just believe what God Said and God will never leave you to do something outside of the word you know I always in Serv of God said he said that the Bible is my absolute it must be dovetails must be written here regardless of what we hear regardless of what things that may come you know if I want to find out the exactly truth of something you know even what has been preached to us this hour we carry it back to the scriptures I believe that's what he taught us that if it doesn't Dove tail with the script he said leave that alone and not just compare one place it must go from Genesis the Revelation it don't need no other interpretation we have had the right interpretation of the scripture for this hour God didn't sent us that voice that gave us that now we must uh have a revelation that what he is saying and be to carry that back to the Bible because it's got to be Christ that's what the whole the message is Christ he ought to be the center of everything we preach he ought to be the very focus of what we do in our churches he ought to be the very center of how we being led B said they that are led by the spirit of God they are they are the sons of God so with the spirit of God leading you he lead you to the word and anytime something lead you away from the word word get away from it cuz it's not God and and if it's God then I like this God word will produce a character and a life in you see that's what the Holy Ghost come to do it come to uh what he come to do actually was bring the reflection of his own self Christ in you the hope of glory see so the life that we living is not you come on now it's not us it's him amen and God don't want to see us he want to see himself we ought to be the very reflection of the word your life ought to be a living testimony that Jesus Christ is not dead but he's alive how do you know can he live in me he lives in you see the life not the quotes the very life if the quotes not producing the life it got to be the wrong quotes get back to the word to serve go we got to get back we make things so complicated and it should be simple yes I know now we know we made things complicated and it should be simple Christ Tabernacle inner people again uniting under one headship the Holy Ghost see as he said here let me read some of that St John 21 he said that they all may be one as thy father are in me and I you and I in thee excuse me that there also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me see and that's what the word actually looking for they are looking for people that is reflect in Christ not just what we say out of our mouth we have done a lot of talking about it but where is the life to go with it where is the life that go with what we sat talking about you know it been years that we didn't use a frame of thought you know you know about the message and these things but it got to be Christ that's what the message is Christ is bringing God back on Earth again inside of a people because the church world has this thing in chaos not only of them even not going to come in our ranks we got so much fanaticism and so much things but but you know stay with the word going go to the scripture M me to First Corinthians 12 Unity of the one God we must to he Israel the Lord our God is one God one one Faith one baptism see one Holy Ghost to bring a many member bride into such a Unity First Corinthians going to drop down 12 and 18 Serv of God was saying this he said that the problem with the church that everybody just trying to do things that they not even called it's like the parts of your body the hand can't do what the leg supposed to do though they are part of their body but they got their own particular function scri [Music] 1218 say but now has God set the members who set them every one of them in the body as it had pleased him I want to God said it in the body it has pleased him so God uh doesn't justu things to be doing it God has a purpose why he does it he calls every one of us for something God has never called anybody for nothing there is a part that you and I must play if we are part of the body every part of your physical body there has a particular function and if that part isn't working properly it affects the whole body so is it when it come to the spiritual body of Christ you are important don't ever think you are not you are important to God regardless of what people think of you you are important to God you're not here to please people but you want to please God you're not here to please the church or the preacher but you want to please God in everything you do Lord I want to be pleasing to you regardless of how everybody else think about it I just want to be under the leadership of what you have called me for everybody can't be the foot but we need the foot so so many times is that and I'm finding out that what happens to people that they want to be something but you know what c you got to try to be nothing most of the one that want to be seen and want to uh uh you know to be on this um platter stere type I want to be in the Forefront that's not the way of Christ normally word God say would God call a man for something he runs from it not this hour they almost try to make it happen and when you do that then you make a mess you bring a reproach upon Christ let me read something Len this is a footnote okay but it just tied right in and it says about the body of Christ it says that the church in the New Testament is called the body of Christ and reflects the spiritual organism of the whole church on Earth he said when the local church is called the body of Christ the spiritual a aspects is emphasized as the church is considered to be the body so individual members are seen as parts of of the body and this is kind of got I use back home said for any church to function properly every member must do his or her part in a harmonous spirit of cooperation with other members see in harmony not out of order in harmony not try to to do what somebody else do no find out what God called you for and when you find it then you begin to humble yourself and you begin to work in at in harmony as the spirit of God lead us and if we can do it in that that's what get us a lot of time you know people don't like that you know order not God's order because nowaday that we finding out not well we we we think that God don't have order but God has order he set things in order he set the church in order he picked a fivefold Ministry and each one of them have their particular job their function and they're to be respected but also they are to work in harmony as the Holy Spirit lead them under the inspiration of God to teach and to preach the people of God the things that they need in order that we can function properly it's like so many time you know and thank God for you know people here that when time for the tent of different things you know everybody do the part that they do everybody know what they do any there one that maybe don't is well can I help yes we we need helpers badly barely we need helpers but there's something that all of us could do Ain but carrying a bag of ice carrying a table putting cloth on a table there is something even for the little children can help that's why we let them help chairs grab a say y'all grab a chair is getting near that seat seon to to prepare it why because we want things to work in a Harmony so that the Holy Spirit you know can can be pleased with what we do no selfish motives no no great great person I do this now no no no no we all helpers one of another for what purpose did God get Glory that's that's it right there God get not you not nobody God for the glorification of God whatever you do it because you want God to get the glory in it no self it about I no it's about him and if we're not doing thing for that purpose then we are doing it in vain see but you must understand he said that the church must understand what the purpose of God is for our lives it's not just about you know you know appreciate brother Simon and the pastor over the years that been trying to hold things together been trying to teach us and lead us in the right way so we must understand that we got to pull together we are more strong and more unified where we can come together but pulling this way one pulling that way one pulling it's hard to get anything done so that's why we we need the Holy Ghost and if we all have that the holy spirit in us that Mind Of God we understand we are working together that God get the glory that people want to come when the tent meeting when the tent meeting oh I'll be there because they feel the spirit they see the unity Al they say man y'all working together me said man we just appreciate coming cuz y'all know how to work together you know what I said brother thank God they don't see the struggle behind it special you know everybody see when the tent get up the lights under it the chairs there everything there but they don't see when ain't nothing been there and you got old people like me brother ear them trying to put a tent up and struggle with something we looking for young brothers and whatnot to help us and they come but see nobody see that but all of it still is for the glory of God we don't complain about man no thank God we able to do these things you ought to thank God that God give you something to do I don't believe nobody going to go to heaven that they ain't doing nothing no if you putting up a sign if you passing out tracks you doing something you witness to somebody invite somebody to come you doing something it may look little but it's great cuz that one person you invite might be the one might be the last one to get us out of here who knows see so that's why our mindset andin got to be whatever I do for Jesus I want it to be real I don't have to have you know um you know somebody telling me Oh brother brother thank you no no no I I don't need that a lot of time I don't like that I rather not don't don't say nothing about me don't even it don't I don't matter if you never know cuz I know that what God sees and then the purpose I'm doing it is not for you to be see me but it's because that my love for God that I I'll be happy with to do something for the Lord I mean all that he done done for us and you don't want to do nothing for God the god that spared you the god that's keeping you and watching over you protecting you when you should have been dead in God's grace and mercy touch your body and then you don't want to even give got a a a a a a testimony all that he done young people don't even realize that how much God look God keep a roof over your head you don't even know how the bills getting paid you don't even know what your parent have to struggle with but it's God doing that and you ought to be able to see now Lord I thank God for my parentless God been good some of y'all young children y'all don't know that actually y'all should have been dead and y'all some of y'all maybe on a dying bed in the hospital you in some bad situation and condition who got you out come on somebody come on don't let that you ain't got nothing to praise God for I don't believe there's nobody in here that God hasn't done something for already that what day you are to say I thank you Lord I Thank You Lord cuz I could have been dead I could have been cut off I could have been in my grave I could have been paralyzed I could be in the wheelchair but Lord you kept me I say Lord you kept me nobody else kept me God but it was you that kept me with that in mind I say thank you anyhow H oh yeah we got something to praise God for I ain't going to take it lightly either you ought not take it lightly we're time for Testimony service young people you need to stand up and say thank God for food on my table cuz you know you ain't put nothing there you don't pay that car insurance thank you Lord thank but you got to thank God that God made a way but n say God is a way maker come on even though when you don't see him working he's still working even though you may not see him working but he's still working he never never stop he never stopped working while you sleep he's working when the devil trying to take you out he working he set you up but God oh my the devil set you up but God Mercy said no I got a hedge around them oh yeah that why the Bible say everything has breath Hallelujah come on I said the only reason you don't have a right to praise God you ain't got breath in your body but if you got breath in your body you got to lift up your hand and say thank you [Applause] Jesus every morning my one of my man prayer said Lord thank you for putting breath in my body cuz it wasn't for you God I wouldn't be able to get up here you wouldn't be able to get up and put on them fine clothes and and do what you do if God didn't put breath in your body you ever feel how do you get up in the morning time what really gets you up God's mercy oh my hall I don't got all off now but that's all right God good sometime we don't realize how good he is let me tell you something he better to you than anything or any person you could ever imagine because God don't let you see what all he's doing there are things behind the SC goes on that God protecting us for principalities and powers and darkness of Satan out to [Music] destroy to scroy you but because of the press and because of the token that your parent has applied to the house to keep that death angel from you they standing in the gap between you and the enemy and they pleading your case Lord I apply the token to my whole house I don't know where they at tonight I don't know what they doing I can't be with them but God I applied the token sometime y'all may be in the middle of get ready to do something you know ain't right but something stop you what would it stop you that's God's grace and mercy [Music] many time I remember I was out in the club doing things what not all of a sudden I just stop Ain nobody else been there well somebody was there all right but I didn't know it was God Mercy that sto oh church I'm all off of it now God bless you [Applause] praise God Amen said they sent in the tape from the message last night in Mullins they sent him to brother jerem recording last night and nobody record I don't think nobody recorded praise God my topic was pray and praise praise God and it's all because we love him the love of God I'm still with the love of God if you love him amen if you love him and I was listening to the prophet today and he said if you love him he says doing the right thing he says you don't have to you know give somebody a drink of water uh go visit somebody in prison or or give somebody some food or something he said you you can do that for people that you care about he said but you ought to be able to do it for your enemy somebody who will kill you yes sir you ought to be able to do it for them he said because they did kill him they killed Jesus and you ought to be able to do for them he said but these things you don't have to practice this what I ought to do he said because you can't help yourself said eternal life is living for others if you got it it's automated praise
