[36:30] amen we can't trust ourselves we got to
[36:32] trust the
[36:33] Lord
[36:35] amen God is
[36:39] good 1 Corinthians 13 I read the first
[36:42] you read the next and we read the last
[36:44] verse
[36:45] together though I speak with the tongues
[36:48] of men and angels have not charity I am
[36:52] become a sounding brass and a tanken
[36:56] symbol to
[37:11] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[37:14] the poor and though I have the give
[37:18] though I give my body to be burnt and
[37:21] have not charity it profited me what
[37:24] nothing four charity suffer
[37:35] does not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[37:39] not her own is not easily provoke thanth
[37:45] no what evil
[37:51] sixth Beth all
[37:54] things believeth all things
[37:58] hopeth all things and doth what all
[38:02] things
[38:15] eight for we know in
[38:18] part and we prophesied in part 10
[38:29] when I was a child I spe as a child I
[38:33] understood as a child I thought as a
[38:35] child but when I became a man I put away
[38:39] childish things
[38:41] 12
[38:51] see together now by faith hope charity
[38:56] these three but the greatest of these is
[38:59] Charity may God bless the reading of his
[39:01] word you may be
[39:04] seated you know I I thank God he says
[39:08] we're talking about that when that which
[39:11] is perfect is
[39:12] come when that which is perfect is
[39:16] come and you know it was told us by the
[39:20] Bible and Jesus said in Matthew 5 be
[39:24] perfect as I
[39:26] perfect said in Hebrews be holy for I'm
[39:31] holy are you with me so when we look at
[39:36] what God requires the church say when he
[39:39] comes back for the church or comes back
[39:41] for his bride it'll be a church without
[39:44] spot rankor blemish or any such thing so
[39:48] God is looking for a
[39:50] perfect church or perfect indiv for you
[39:55] and I to be perfect
[39:57] so if Perfection is required then there
[40:01] must be provision made whereby we can be
[40:05] perfect
[40:07] amen if a Perfection is required then
[40:11] that must
[40:13] be
[40:15] amen if there's a deep call it to the
[40:18] Deep then there's a deep to respond amen
[40:21] if God is requiring
[40:23] Perfection then God is able to bring
[40:28] that to pass in our
[40:31] lives when that which is perfect is
[40:35] come
[40:38] now we
[40:40] want also talk to
[40:43] the the greatest gift of
[40:46] all amen God is when we speak of
[40:52] love and we think about God is the great
[40:55] Fountain of
[40:58] love amen God is the great Creator he's
[41:02] the great Fountain of
[41:04] Love first John tell us God is what God
[41:08] is
[41:10] love but we find ourselves
[41:13] battering every
[41:16] day you and and I and ourselves
[41:22] cannot love the way God wants us to love
[41:27] but it's not it's only
[41:30] because his
[41:33] love is given to
[41:36] us by the Holy
[41:39] Ghost the Bible tells us the Holy Ghost
[41:41] is the love of God sheded abroad in our
[41:43] hearts in Romans
[41:45] 5 so the love of God now what what's
[41:49] going to keep us everything else going
[41:51] to fail us but the greatest gift is what
[41:55] the greatest gift is love
[41:57] and love never in uh in 1 Corinthians 13
[42:01] and8 it says charity
[42:05] never charity never
[42:08] fail
[42:09] amen everything else a fail but charity
[42:13] never
[42:14] fail and we sing this song he never fail
[42:17] me yet Jesus Christ never fail me yet
[42:22] everywhere I go I tell the
[42:25] world I want the world to know that
[42:28] Jesus Christ what never fa never failed
[42:32] me yet amen amen amen so when we
[42:37] associate amen never fail amen charity
[42:42] never
[42:44] amen you know I rather be guilty of
[42:49] loving you too
[42:52] much than anything else amen are you
[42:56] with
[42:57] amen see sometimes we find it difficult
[43:01] to
[43:03] love when it looks like uh an individual
[43:07] have done you
[43:10] wrong but the Bible tells us
[43:13] Christ amen forgave
[43:16] us even when we were yet sinners Christ
[43:20] died for the
[43:22] ungodly now the gospel message we can
[43:25] have all kind of inter mment in church
[43:29] but the gospel message is God so love
[43:32] you amen the world that he gave his only
[43:36] begotten son amen whosoever believe in
[43:39] him should not perish but have what
[43:41] Everlasting everlasting life now when we
[43:45] talk
[43:47] about the Greater
[43:49] Love
[43:52] uh the great the greatest gift for I
[43:57] mean St John 15 St John 15 God is
[44:04] good St John
[44:06] 15 and I'm just going to start at the
[44:09] 15th verse St John 15 and
[44:12] 15
[44:13] amen he starts off I'm the vine I'm the
[44:17] True Vine my father is the husband
[44:20] amen but the 15th verse
[44:24] says uh the 13th verse says greater love
[44:28] has no man than
[44:29] what Greater
[44:32] Love greater love
[44:35] amen that which is perfect has
[44:39] come love
[44:45] amen God's Prophet
[44:48] said back in 54 and then he comes back
[44:51] in the church ages and said in that love
[45:00] is that which is perfect has
[45:04] come recycling over and over that which
[45:08] is perfect is
[45:11] come going beyond the curtain of time
[45:13] that which is
[45:15] perfect only perfect love can enter
[45:19] here are you with me so you and I must
[45:23] have perfect love
[45:27] perfect
[45:28] love when we speak of the perfect love
[45:31] we we're talking about where is
[45:34] divine uh perfect love of God rests in
[45:40] our
[45:41] hearts it seals
[45:44] us are you with
[45:46] me so the greater love has no man than
[45:51] this that a man lay down his
[45:55] life for his friend

[46:03] my friends if you do whatever I command

[1:19:29] efforts nothing wrong with doing a lot
[1:19:32] of these things but don't make those
[1:19:36] things sometimes people don't know what
[1:19:39] Spirit they are and they said pastor
[1:19:42] your discernment is
[1:19:44] off I be guilty a lot of times
[1:19:49] the you need to discern this person need
[1:19:53] this

[1:20:08] you know they wouldn't have left the
[1:20:09] church you have had oh you'd have had a
[1:20:13] a church full of

[1:20:53] care but I care
[1:20:56] here are you with me it wasn't to assist

[1:21:12] love you the pastor Miss but I ain't
[1:21:15] going to miss
[1:21:17] you you see what I'm

[1:21:27] get a seat in the
[1:21:28] church you
[1:21:32] couldn't their kind of
[1:21:35] love and their kind of
