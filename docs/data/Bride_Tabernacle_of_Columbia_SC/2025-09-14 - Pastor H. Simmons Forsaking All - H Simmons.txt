Amen. As we stand for reading the book of St. Luke 14th chapter and we're going to begin at the 25th verse. I'll read the first, you read the next and we'll read the latter verse together. Luke 14 and 25. And there went great multitudes with him. And he turned and said unto them 26, &gt;&gt; if any man come to me and not his father and mother and wife and children and brother and sister in his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. &gt;&gt; And whosoever doeth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciples. 28 &gt;&gt; For you intending to build tower sitt &gt;&gt; least hardly after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it. All that behold it began to mark him. 30 &gt;&gt; saying this man began to build and was not able to finish. &gt;&gt; Oh, what king goeth to war against another king setth not down first and consult whether he be able with 10,000 to meet him that cometh against him with 20,000. 32 [Applause] &gt;&gt; So likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he has. He cannot be my disciples. 34 &gt;&gt; together. It neither is fit for the land, nor yet for the donill, but men cast it out. He that has an ear, let him hear. God bless you. May you be seated. Praise God. We want to talk to you familiar word forsaken all. Forsaken all. The prophet God kind of spoke on that. Forsaken all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh are we willing to forsake everything? And that's I I I find that many I I believe that the foundation has to be laid in each and every one of our lives. And often times I tell about my Christian walk as I started out a lot of times as a teenager, you know, I got baptized and everything and you don't wanted to be a Christian, but you know, you sometimes you look around in the church and see other young people and you're just 18 years old and you want to you want to serve the Lord, but you look around at all the other young people and and you see what they're doing and sometimes you it stumbles you because you come from the world and you come to God and and you see the young people that perhaps they were supposed to be Christian all their life but yet it's a stumbling block for a young person coming in and seeing they don't have a desire or a lot of young people didn't have a desire to to be Christians, but they were just raised in the church, but their desires in their heart, they want to be out in the street and you talk. So goodness, you coming from that kind of lifestyle and you know not really, you know, getting depth in the streets, but you know, you come from the streets and the young people as a whole that's reared up, they wanted to experience some of the things you've experienced and then they can say, "Well, then I can come back and serve the Lord." But I said, "Oh, no. A lot of young people in my day, they didn't make it through. They didn't make it to get 18. A lot of them uh if they were 18, some of them are doing 20 years. And a lot of them, you know, lost their lives as young people or they was became almost drug addicts or alcoholic. I mean, most of a lot of the football players that played football that was supposed to be making the pros, man, those guys became heron addicts and and they were sniffing cocaine in high school. And a lot of times you you look for them to be successful, but by the grace of God, I want I want you to consider forsaking all. I had to come to a a time that I didn't look at others. I think we spent our times as Christian looking at what other people do. But as I was praying, I said, "God, what should I say this morning?" He says, "Forsaken all. You got to give it up all." And I'm I'm telling you, sometimes people serve the Lord for 20, 30, 40, 50 years, and they haven't got this. They hadn't even started right. They never started right. And I said, you know, but I thank God for his grace upon my life that one day I had to realize if I really wanted to be a Christian and if I really wanted to go to heaven and if I really wanted this that I had to give it up all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we come to a stage we give up a little this, a little of that. I didn't have a problem with drinking, smoking, uh, you know, but I had my problems. You going to get into that. I had my problems. You know what I'm saying? But, you know, by the grace of God, we we were born in sin shaped in iniquity. Sometimes people don't see a need of change in their life. But I saw a need because I I looked at my future and where I was going. My wife and I was talking about it the other day. She said while she was in college, she seen those older fellas maybe 25, 30 years old on the college campus come every year for to talk to the freshman. I said, "Yeah." And I looked at that life. I said, "Uh-uh. No. I I mean it's just graduating and then I looked at you know the fellas that you know and they at 18 and 21 they can go into the nightclub and all of that and they can drink and do you want that is that happiness is that joy. See what people want to be they want to be free. They want to be happy. They want to have a a a a blessing a phony a phony joy. People are not real. They're not really at peace because if they don't serve the Lord, they have to accept the invitation. They have to accept a pacify, something that won't satisfy them, but yet it it'll make them feel a little a little pleasure for a moment. make them feel a little happy for a season. But that's not why God ma how God made us for a purpose. He made us in the image and the likeness of God. Made man in his image and his likeness. So God meant from the beginning for you to be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So if you miss your purpose in life, you miss your purpose in life. what God put you in this world or let you come in this world to do. If you miss that, then you uh you you're miserable and you'll keep on thirsting, keep on hungering for something and you'll never be able to achieve it until you get God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody praise God. uh forsaken all now counting up the cost. I had to just surrender everything. I when I when I I I mean it didn't matter if nobody went, nobody served the Lord. I didn't care. I mean I had to just get I wanted God for myself. I wanted to know God for myself. So, you know, you get around 19 and you this ain't working. You know, in and out, backward and forward. That ain't working. I got to get down in the business. But, but 19, this ain't working. So, I had to get past all the distraction. I had to look at Jesus and see the need of God for myself in my life. And you got to get past all the distractions, all the other stuff that's keeping you from serving the Lord and giving him your all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, he started off if any man come after me, you know, he got to deny his father, mother, you know, hate, you know, hate, you got to give them, I mean, you can't let them be first. God has to be first in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometime we get we got family got this got that all kind of pro things first. But God has to be your absolute he must have to be he has to be first in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you got to and then he says your brother your sister you got got to hate him. That's what he says. In other words you got to you know you can't love them more than you love God. &gt;&gt; You can't let them be God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? But sometimes your your family would separate cause you not to serve the Lord and it cause you not to get in the position in the place where God want you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you let that be your anchor. But God wants to be your anchor. Then he says, "Not only that, then whosoever do not bear his cross." So serving the Lord, he said a cross. You know Jesus bear a cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. He went through something for you and I. &gt;&gt; The one that was in the world and the world was made by him. Yeah. And and all of that, he went through severe hatred and pain, sorrow, and suffering for you. And I didn't have to do it, but he he he showed us a pathway. And all the agony and pain and all that he suffered, he was doing that for you and I that you might know that he's a God that touched by the feeling of your infirmity. And then not only did he go through it for you and Amen. He showed you that this is the way you I Jesus bear the cross. Why don't you bear your take up your cross? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he's offering you something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He did it for us. We couldn't give him nothing, but he wanted to give us something. &gt;&gt; If you take up your cross and you follow him, he wants to give you eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to bless you. Amen. Uh, is it a blessing taking up my cross? Yes, it's a blessing when you take up your cross and follow him. Be his disciples. Now, I I I I I want you to know that we used to fashion ourselves after the world. We want to look like the world. We want to act like the world. with with us we unknowingly we want to look a certain way because we were conforming to the image of the world. The Bible tells us not to be conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind. We wanted to conform. We were conforming to an image and that image usually come from Hollywood. Are you with me? how the people are uh are are dressing or how they're looking, how the football players, the basketball players, which all are miserable miserable lives. They look, they smile and they're happy. Amen. But you know, you don't know the pain that they go through. You don't know the sorrow and agony that they go through. and and and then they they they look a certain way and they have a certain image or a certain persona and and sometimes we want to follow that image and think, "Oh, I'm cool. Oo, this is nice." Man don't know that the after the effects of all of that stuff. But he said, "Be my disciple." If you be his disciple, how I how do how do the other children going to look at me? How my family going to look at me to be his disciple? You mean to tell me in in order to be his disciple, I got to carry this cross. I mean, you know, I I got family that I love, but I want to be his disciple. You got to take up your cross. &gt;&gt; To be a disciple. And that's what I'm saying. A lot of people start on this Christian walk, but they hadn't really they hadn't really uh uh uh had a good foundationbased Christian walk. It's it's all in he said if the foundation be destroyed, what can the righteous do? The foundation. Amen. You got to lay a a foundation. Your foundation must be built upon the rock and not the sand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz the wind's going to blow and the storm going to come. And if your foundation and you are anchored on the rock, &gt;&gt; it's going to blow you away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The flood's going to drown you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things are coming in the life. Amen. That'll knock you. Amen. That'll rock you, that'll shake you. But if you on that solid rock, you don't have to worry about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can go through the storm. The storm. Amen. It won't hurt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your roots will just get deeper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, uh, as you look at this, he says, uh, that you take up your cross and and except you take up your cross, you cannot be my disciple. Uh and then he it went on to say which of you intending to build a tower not send it down and count up the cost whether you have sufficient to finish it. I say a a lot of times we didn't take time to you know to really you don't look at it am I get am I really surrendering all you know or am I just coming to a point I'm tired of living like this I don't want to do this I want to be a Christian I want to be saved but that's nice that's you know that's just general faith but is it as we said in uh Bible study isn't intellectual your faith or is it faith that's coming from your heart because you can receive Jesus intellectually in your mind but not in your heart. So the prophet talked about down in your soul down deep that you receiving Jesus Christ down in your soul. The Bible said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Ain't that right? But you wonder why you haven't received the gift of the Holy Ghost. Because God wants to Amen. God wants you to surrender all. Amen. There's no It's no It's no way you can get the Holy Ghost until you come into that place that you willing to surrender all. And I'm going to tell you I if you think that Amen. living a Christian life, you don't have a cross to carry, you don't have a cross to bear, then you're wrong. He telling you from the beginning, if you going to come after me and you're going to be my disciple, you take up your cross, it's going to be some pain. It's going to be some suffering. It's going to be some things you're going to go through. But I think God is worth it. &gt;&gt; It's worth all our suffering, all our pain. All we have to give up. God, Amen. going to give us something better. &gt;&gt; I mean, if he if anything he asked you to give up, he got something better to give you in return. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But see, but um now do we believe that &gt;&gt; some people are sat down and they they don't have but uh $50 in the bank. And now I I'm using the money as a as a scenario, but that that's not what I'm talking about. Some folk hold on to their $50 and won't give it up and God want to give them a million dollars, but they just so satisfied with their $50, they think they rich. You know what I'm saying? And and and the little uh uh little uh uh uh life that they have, the little uh uh little things that they're holding on to that they don't want to give up, they hold on to that because they think they got something. Oh, I got it. What you got? I'm pretty. What? What you got? I'm handsome. I'm cool. You holding on to that? That's what's keeping you from being his disciple? Amen. I I got some things that I'm doing that I know it ain't right, but I I I I ain't ready to give it up. You know, who wouldn't would be ready to give something up when I'm getting something of such great value? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I I mean, I might not want a Rolls Roy, but I you know, that that old um 2012, I not somebody give me a Rolls-Royce, I'll give it, you know, for a Rolls Roy. Even though I don't want one or Maser, what you call it? &gt;&gt; Maserati or whatever y'all want to call it, I give it up, you know. I I I I appreciate that old 2012 out there, but I I'll be glad to give it up. Somebody want to give me something way better. And I'm talking about God want to give you a better life, but you want to hold no you can have this if you going to give me something better, right? &gt;&gt; But you know, most people, Amen, they don't believe his report. They don't believe that God got a better life for you. God want to give you more than Amen. more than you could ever imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your mind can't even conceive what God want to do for you and through you and in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; you got to kind I I'm using this life scenario that you know you're building a a and you're building a house, building a building, but your life is is you you you're a temple and you're a building and God is building your character, building you up as an individual and he's trying to build you into the stature of a perfect man. He's bringing you into maturity. Amen. You know, sometimes parents don't have time for their children to mold their image. And so the school teacher in the schoolhouse are kind of try to help you out a little, but they can't help you. so much. The parents should be, you know, molding you and and shaping you in in in such a way that they know that you can handle life when you come uh to a certain age. That you can handle driving, you can handle a a job, you can handle getting out and getting out the house where we can have some more room. You know what I'm saying? They looking forward to that day. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Do you having children and having a family and they got some grands? They looking forward to that day. So what what they what they got to do is prepare you and try to get you ready for it. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So they're they're preparing you for that. that you know how to treat your husband, you know how to treat your wife, you know how to, you know, you know how to live. You know, parents are trying to get you to that place. Now, if they don't care, they just you just eat and drink and they going about their business. I had friends, parents with school teachers and different uh you know different types of jobs and and I went to their house and mama get in, she take her drink, daddy get in, take a drink, they go to their bedroom, you know, I didn't have, you know, rich parents and all of that. And I call him rich back then, you know, cuz we came up 15 of us, you know. You know, but but you know, mama had time to sit down and talk to you, daddy and all these little things. He got some wise sans and son this and son that, you know, but I said to these people, you know, they teach school, they have professional jobs and all, but seem like they ain't had no time for their children. I said, "Oh, this is strange." So I went from house to house with my friends and they included me with the you know the middle class at that time. I said I didn't think I was middle class but I'm saying but it's no time. So people go to church and they're listen they're looking for the word of God. They're looking for life and they go to church and the church is all about, you know, we want to build a bigger taking up three, four, five offerings and talking about an offering for this, an offering for that, and this, a plan for this, and a plan for that, and it's all about money. And then they give you a hype sermon to hype you up and lift you up, and you hyped up. But where's the where's the real I want God. &gt;&gt; Amen.

God is good. &gt;&gt; It's happily the 29th verse. happily after he had laid the foundation and not able to finish it. All that beholded it began to mark him. Now I don't want people to mark your Christian walk. I want your Christian walk to be solid. I want it to be firm and sure. I don't want people to be marking you. Are you with me?

You you you made an effort to try to know him by what? Your intellect, your knowledge, but did you try him in in your heart?

[Laughter] My children say, "Daddy, don't say closing cuz you go longer." So, I better take that back. Amen. Philippians 3 and 7. But what things were what? &gt;&gt; Gain to me those I count what? See, if you want Christ, you got to all that you gain, you got to count it loss. &gt;&gt; All that I have, I'm going to count it lost. Amen. It doesn't matter what what achievements you have. Paul was a great achiever. He was a supposed to be a good church boy. Amen. He kept the law. He was blameless. He had all the religion. But he was one thing he lacked. He was persecuting the ones that he thought was wrong. He was persecuting the saints of God and he got letters to put them in jail because they were preaching Jesus. I'm telling we getting close to that time now. We getting close to that hour where Amen. you might be coming under scrutiny for standing for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

But anyway, but you can take a stand for God and people hate you. You can take a stand for the word and people want to kill you. Amen. Because they despise. Amen. They despise somebody that's standing for God. You can't say what's right. Cuz the world so backwards when you say what's right, they think, Amen. That's a hate crime. You telling people what's the word of God say and they think you hate them. You love them because you tell them the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not compromising with the word. You telling the folks what the word say and they think you hate them. I listen to a little bit what that man was saying. He saying some good things. People shing. Amen. I don't get into that politics, but a lot of times you say some good things, people hate you. You try to live a Christian life, people will hate you for living a Christian life. Why? Because it's condemning them, their lifestyle. Come on, smoke a joint. I got a joint already. I'm smoking. You can't get higher than me. Amen. Praise God. I'm already I'm already high. Amen. Ain't that right? He said, "Be not drunk with wine, but rather be filled with the what? &gt;&gt; With the spirit." Amen. And so what what makes you happy? What makes you feel good? It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's Christ. &gt;&gt; I got to close. I told you but I I count loss. That's what Paul is saying. Yay doubtless and I count all things. Forsaken what? What we said? Forsaken what? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; Forsaken all. Then he says, "And I count all things but what? &gt;&gt; Laws for the ecstasy of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. for whom I have what? &gt;&gt; I suffered the loss of all things. All his degrees and all that schooling he went through. Lord have mercy. Theological training and coming up a Pharisee to the Pharisee. Now I got to give all of that up cuz I found out I was wrong. Amen. I was coming against the truth. Coming against Jesus. He didn't know Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus Christ of the New but that I may win Christ. Then he said that I might be found in him, not having my own what? &gt;&gt; Which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Then he says that I may know him in the what? &gt;&gt; Resurrection. &gt;&gt; In the power of his resurrection, in the fellowship of his what? &gt;&gt; Suffering. and being made conformed of uh not to Hollywood but to his what &gt;&gt; Paul says I die daily. Are you willing to die to yourself, your thoughts, your ideas? Are you willing to lose your identity and be like Christ? Have you forsaken all? You know, it's one thing to forsake it all and then, you know, when it came to Lot and his wife and his daughters, the angel said, "Get out the city and don't look back. All your labor and all your achievements, everything that you got in that city, the nice fine house because he was the mayor of the city and all of that, all of that you got, now you got to get out the city because God going to destroy it. And I'm saying to you, you got to run for your life and get out &gt;&gt; of your sin because God will destroy you. &gt;&gt; Sin will cause you to die and go to hell. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But if you want to hold on to it now, you know your destiny. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But if you willing to uh uh get out now, I'm going to tell you something. It must was some strong demons in in Sodom. They must have had a whole lot there. But God's prayer, somebody pray for me, brother Gordon, had me on their mind. It's some strong demon powers that caused them to not to want to leave till the angel had to get them by the hand &gt;&gt; and pull them out. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm saying, you know, sometime you got so much you're holding on to God have to take you by the hand and pull you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you you don't belong in this world here. You belong in another world. I got another dimension. I got a heavenly places. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to I'm trying to woo you. Can't you see? I'm trying to get your attention. What you holding on to? Surrender all. &gt;&gt; Forsake it all. And I got something better for you. &gt;&gt; But do you believe it? No. All you can do is to go uh what you see. The Bible said the just shall live by what? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Faith. We walk by faith, not by what? &gt;&gt; Sight. &gt;&gt; Sight. Amen. So, it's a faith. Amen. You must have he that cometh to God must first of all believe that he is &gt;&gt; and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. God, I believe. Amen. Praise God. That there's a that there's there's streets of gold. &gt;&gt; I believe that there's that there there's joy. Amen. and there's peace and there'll be no more pain, no more sorrow, no more crying, no more dying. God, you offering me eternal life. &gt;&gt; Out of all the problems and suffering and all the pain that I've been through, you giving me eternal life. All I got to do is believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forsake it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shake somebody hand and tell them, "Let's forsake all. Let's give it up all. &gt;&gt; Let's give up all. He said that's what powers in the church now. But it is controlled by law. And the law is not keeping a bunch of commandments. It's a law of faith. Jesus said, "All things are possible to them that believe." If you can believe it, whatever God will lead your soul to believe, that is yours. &gt;&gt; Every place the soul of your feet can set upon by faith. &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; God gives it to you. It's yours. You possess it. If you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you. You see what I mean? That's power. That power is controlled. If you are a son of God, are you a daughter of God that never leaves you? It's with you all the time, but your faith get away from it, but it's still there. But of course, that power is controlled by faith. We've have all us a world out there living in it. But if you a son of God or daughter of God, you got the power of God in you. You got created power. I said you got created power. You see when we speak anything if something is anchored in us to us we should never speak it until we can believe it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then when we believe it, we speak it. And that created word goes out. It's part of God. It creates. You have to have faith to speak it. It's got creative power in what you speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They can change your whole life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you believe what you say. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just say things just like not not knowing that we are create we are amateur gods and we can create. Sometime we just set things off the top of our head and just set things. Oh, I'm having a bad day. You having a bad day. It get worse and the day become bad. But you said this is the day the Lord has made. I will rejoice and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; How things are going? I'm blessed today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Things are going good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got to close. God bless you. But you have created power with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't no don't don't don't don't don't settle with oh I'm so down you are you're not living by feeling.
