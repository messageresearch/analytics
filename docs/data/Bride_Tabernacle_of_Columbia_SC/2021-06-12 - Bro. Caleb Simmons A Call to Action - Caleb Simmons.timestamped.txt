[29:32] verse 13 esther chapter 4 and verse 13.
[29:40] when you got it say amen
[29:43] amen that's esther chapter 4 and verse
[29:46] 13 and a reads
[29:48] the mordecai commanded to answer esther
[29:51] think not with ourselves that thou shalt
[29:54] escape in the king's house
[29:56] more than all the jews for if thou
[30:00] altogether holdeth thy peace at this
[30:02] time
[30:03] then shall their enlargements and
[30:06] deliverance arise
[30:08] to the jews from another place but thou
[30:10] in thy father's house shall be destroyed
[30:13] and who knoweth whether thou art come to
[30:15] the kingdom for such a time as this
[30:18] then answer made them return mordecai
[30:21] this answer
[30:23] go gather together all the jews that
[30:25] present
[30:26] and shoeshine that are present in
[30:29] shushan
[30:30] and fast heat for me and neither eat nor
[30:32] drink
[30:33] three days nights night
[30:36] or day i also and my maidens will fast
[30:39] likewise and so
[30:41] will i go in unto the king which is not
[30:44] according to the law
[30:45] and if i perish i perish so mordecai
[30:48] went his way and did according to all
[30:50] that
[30:51] esther had commanded him and man god
[30:53] bless to read another word you may be
[30:54] seated
[30:57] tonight we'd like to speak on a little
[31:00] topic called
[31:01] a call to action a call to action in
[31:05] this
[31:06] if you read before the story it goes
[31:08] into
[31:10] it talks about mordecai and how there
[31:11] was a man
[31:13] in the bible whose name was haman and
[31:15] haman had got this spirit of jealousy
[31:18] on him against mordecai
[31:22] and heyman heyman wanted
[31:26] what mordecai had and heyman he looked
[31:28] at mordecai and he said
[31:30] i'm going to do something i'm going to
[31:32] get rid of him better yet i'm going to
[31:34] get rid of
[31:34] all of his people just because of this
[31:37] one person
[31:39] just because of the actions of mordecai
[31:41] and he would not bow down to him
[31:43] he said i'm going to get rid of him and
[31:45] he put out a decree
[31:47] to get rid of to on a certain day at a
[31:50] certain time
[31:51] and had the king to give his approval he
[31:54] would have the opportunity to kill all
[31:56] of the jews
[31:57] and mordecai he sent he sent to
[32:01] he sent to esther and he said he said
[32:04] here in the scripture
[32:05] how do you know that god didn't put you
[32:07] in this place for such a time as this
[32:10] for such a maybe you are the ones maybe
[32:13] god will send deliverance down the line
[32:16] but by that time all your family and
[32:18] everyone your whole household will be
[32:19] wiped out
[32:21] and esther sent back what i call the
[32:24] call to action she said mordecai
[32:25] tell the people to fast and to pray
[32:29] and get down on your knees and after
[32:30] three days i'm gonna go to the king
[32:32] and if i perish i perish and today would
[32:35] like to tell you about
[32:37] to ask that that call to action it's a
[32:40] time that we're living in
[32:42] and it's a season that we're living in
[32:45] that
[32:45] that there has to be some actions behind
[32:47] what we say
[32:49] there has to be a life that's lived
[32:50] behind what you say
[32:52] and the prophet of god he said
[32:56] in the in the message desperation he
[32:58] said i believe that
[33:00] that we're in the days that we're living
[33:02] in where
[33:03] so much and paraphrasing he said there's
[33:05] so much going on and
[33:07] we're seeing the signs of the time we're
[33:09] seeing the way that the
[33:10] people are living we're seeing that
[33:13] we're seeing how things are going
[33:15] and he said that we've got to do
[33:17] something
[33:18] and the greatest weapon that god ever
[33:20] gave us was
[33:22] i remember this the young people did a
[33:24] skit one time and said
[33:26] we got to get this message to jesus we
[33:29] have
[33:29] we got to get this message to him we
[33:31] can't take it over by airplane
[33:33] we can't take it over by train but the
[33:35] only way that we can get the message to
[33:37] them we got to fall down on our knees
[33:39] and pray
[33:40] and that's a call to action that we all
[33:43] have the
[33:44] god has given us all the ability and the
[33:46] grace
[33:47] to be able to get down on our knees and
[33:49] pray and they say that the when the
[33:51] weakest christian
[33:53] gets on his knees with a sincere heart
[33:56] and asks god the devil starts to shake
[33:59] he starts to tremble
[34:00] because he know there's power in the
[34:02] name of jesus there's power
[34:04] when you get down there with a sincere
[34:06] heart and say lord
[34:08] you know you know best you know what it
[34:11] is and we all have that call and that
[34:13] purpose that we must choose
[34:15] as joshua said choose you this day whom
[34:17] you're going to serve
[34:19] because it's going to be required of us
[34:21] at that day when we meet him
[34:22] and we come to that judgment seat and
[34:25] say lord and the lord answer that
[34:26] question what did you do with the life
[34:28] that i gave you
[34:29] and it's that call is that it's that
[34:32] desire that has to be in you
[34:35] then lord i want to get draw closer to
[34:37] you
[34:38] i see the things that are going on i see
[34:40] the times lord i want to draw closer to
[34:43] you
[34:44] and you're calling me to to separate
[34:46] myself
[34:47] and said each one but god but it says
[34:50] that
[34:51] god has to do something many times most
[34:54] of us don't get to that place until
[34:56] and we are in dire need something has
[34:59] happened something has come up and we
[35:01] are in dire need
[35:02] for god to move we are in dire need
[35:05] there is no place that we can turn but
[35:07] to god
[35:08] there's no place many times these
[35:11] moments happen when there's nothing that
[35:13] we can do is go to god and say
[35:14] there's nothing the doctor said no the
[35:17] the lawyer said no the judge said no
[35:20] and we get into those moments in time
[35:22] and say lord now i need you
[35:24] but what an what about getting there
[35:26] before it happens
[35:28] i said the lord has been dealing and
[35:30] said don't get ready be ready
[35:32] don't a lot of times we we we in we
[35:35] think that
[35:36] when it happened we're gonna have time
[35:37] to get ready we're gonna be in
[35:39] uh lord i'm sort of getting get get
[35:42] getting ready
[35:43] but he said don't get ready be ready be
[35:45] ready for
[35:46] for what's going to come be ready for
[35:48] for the you see the sign god never sent
[35:50] judgment without warning
[35:52] he always warns his people and we see
[35:55] the things that's going on we see
[35:57] there's there's different moves of men
[36:00] across the world there's different
[36:01] powers and kingdoms
[36:03] rising up and showing forth their might
[36:06] showing forth
[36:07] and say that we only got so much time
[36:09] left
[36:10] and we can wait till it happens and say
[36:12] oh lord and crying and all to be filled
[36:14] up
[36:14] but by that time will it be too late
[36:17] will it be too late for
[36:19] for for you to get in action said when a
[36:22] soldier goes to battle
[36:24] and all of a sudden the shooting start
[36:26] he can't be looking for his gun
[36:28] he can't be trying to look on the ground
[36:30] oh is it down there by my feet is it
[36:32] under my bed
[36:33] he has to know that he is ready he is
[36:36] prepared
[36:38] he is ready to start this battle and to
[36:40] go in there and say
[36:41] if i perish i perish but i know that god
[36:44] has everything under control
[36:46] when i go because i i met him somewhere
[36:49] i had an
[36:49] experience with him i got down on my
[36:51] knees and god
[36:52] met me and i know the lord is real see
[36:55] you got to know him for yourself
[36:57] you can't depend on someone else's
[36:59] relationship with god
[37:00] and say i'm gonna lean lean on you so
[37:02] you can pull me through
[37:04] i'm gonna lean on you because i know
[37:06] that you know the lord
[37:08] so let me lean on you and see and see if
[37:10] you gonna hold me up too
[37:11] and i said that there's in the scripture
[37:13] where he talks about the
[37:15] the five wise and the five foolish and
[37:18] and the five foolish they
[37:19] they went to lean on the wise and the y
[37:20] i said no go get your own
[37:22] but by the time they went and they were
[37:24] searching and trying to get
[37:26] they realized when they came back they
[37:27] were too late
[37:29] so who are you leaning on are you
[37:30] leaning on jesus are you leaning on
[37:32] somebody else
[37:33] are you leaning on the one that that's
[37:35] all that'll never leave you and never
[37:37] forsake you
[37:38] or you're leaning on someone that knows
[37:39] him and said lord i want to lean on you
[37:42] i want to be able to trust you
[37:44] and when i need you in my time of need i
[37:46] know that you're going to be there
[37:48] in my time of need i know that but lord
[37:50] i want to have that relationship with
[37:52] you
[37:53] whether i get down on my knees i said
[37:54] one of the most wonderful things that
[37:56] ever happened to me in my life
[37:58] was when i prayed one time and i heard
[38:00] that i seen the lord do it
[38:01] exactly what i asked him to say that's
[38:04] that's a person
[38:05] that's when you know the personal
[38:07] relationship with you and god
[38:09] but thinking that every single
[38:11] relationship that you building
[38:13] has to in life is a building process
[38:16] it don't happen overnight if you have a
[38:18] true friendship
[38:20] with anybody in life it took time to
[38:23] build that true friendship
[38:24] it took time to whatever relationship
[38:27] friendship
[38:28] anything that you or partnership it took
[38:31] time
[38:32] to build that over time you developed
[38:34] that and you strengthened it
[38:36] and it takes time to get to certain
[38:38] levels in certain places with god
[38:40] but the only way to do it is down on
[38:42] your knees
[38:44] getting closer to him and sometimes the
[38:46] devil will fight
[38:47] the easiest thing when when you really
[38:49] get serious about it
[38:51] the devil people think well when i get
[38:53] serious
[38:54] about my relationship with god
[38:56] everything going to be easy
[38:57] because i got that determination that
[38:59] don't mean the devil ain't gonna fight
[39:01] you
[39:01] the devil gonna fight you more because
[39:05] because he knows that when you get that
[39:07] real relationship with them
[39:09] that you're gonna be able to do mighty
[39:11] things
[39:12] you're gonna be able to do things that
[39:14] he doesn't want he knows that
[39:16] he doesn't you don't always have to
[39:18] defeat the
[39:19] entire group sometimes all you got to do
[39:21] is take out the leader
[39:24] so if you are the leader and he takes
[39:27] you out
[39:28] he know that the rest of them gonna fall
[39:30] he know that other people around you
[39:32] watching you
[39:33] to see what you're gonna do because you
[39:34] declare that you are a christian
[39:36] but if you're falling in line with them
[39:38] how in the world are they gonna look up
[39:40] to you
[39:40] they say you're doing the same thing i'm
[39:42] doing you setting the standard
[39:45] i said you setting the standard but
[39:46] you're saying it's so low and god
[39:48] requires so much higher but he
[39:50] promised that he would give you the
[39:52] strength to endure he promised that he
[39:54] would give you
[39:55] the strength to be that light and he
[39:57] will make it stronger not you
[39:59] he will make it stronger you take that
[40:01] time and you get into prayer and you get
[40:03] with him and
[40:05] i said many times it it takes it takes a
[40:09] moment like the woman in luke chapter 8
[40:12] was the woman with the issue of blood
[40:14] she got to that point where
[40:16] she she got so desperate she said i
[40:18] don't even have to have god pray for me
[40:21] i don't have to have jesus pray for me
[40:23] all i need to do is touch the hem of his
[40:25] garment
[40:26] she knew that she got close enough she
[40:28] might have had to i can imagine had to
[40:31] push some people crawl on the ground
[40:33] crawl between some people
[40:35] and try to squeeze through some tight
[40:38] places
[40:38] but she knew if only i can get to jesus
[40:42] everything will be all right and she she
[40:44] took that call and she put in some
[40:46] actions
[40:47] they call you me they said one of the
[40:49] modest mottos of
[40:51] one of the armed forces is many are
[40:53] called but few are chosen
[40:55] many are called but few are chosen and
[40:58] and lord i want to be chosen by you lord
[41:01] i want you to call me where he leads me
[41:03] i'll follow
[41:04] and i'll go with them with them all the
[41:06] way home and said i want
[41:08] lord i want you to lead me and push me
[41:11] because lord lord i need your direction
[41:14] i need your guidance lord i need because
[41:16] i don't want to be
[41:17] outside of your will for my life i don't
[41:20] want to be anywhere that you don't want
[41:21] me to be lord
[41:23] and said in in the bible there was a
[41:26] there was another man
[41:28] there was it was gideon gideon was out
[41:31] there he was attending to his own life
[41:34] and one day god came to him paraphrasing
[41:36] that
[41:37] he said i want to use you to deliver my
[41:39] people and gideon said me
[41:42] me not little me nah lord i'm not worthy
[41:46] but god said no he said
[41:47] well if this be god let me test them he
[41:50] said
[41:50] i'm gonna put the sheep's cloth out
[41:52] there and lord i want the ground to be
[41:54] wet and the sheet cloth to be dry
[41:56] so god did it and then he came back he
[42:00] said well
[42:00] well that let me check it again so he
[42:03] came back the next day and said lord i
[42:05] want
[42:05] the ground to be dry and a sheep claw to
[42:08] be wet
[42:09] and so the next day god did god did what
[42:12] he asked
[42:13] and he came and he came and he run and
[42:15] he checked the cloth the next day
[42:17] it was full of water so much he was able
[42:18] to ring it out of it he said
[42:20] i know this is god so he put out a call
[42:23] to action
[42:24] to the people he put it out and he said
[42:27] he said he and so many thousands of
[42:30] people came
[42:32] and god said they're marching to go to
[42:34] the enemy and he said
[42:35] he said you got too many people and he
[42:38] just like what the enemy
[42:39] triple triple our size maybe even
[42:42] quadruple our size
[42:43] how you saying that i got too many and
[42:45] god said i want to weed some of these
[42:46] people out
[42:47] because not everybody gonna partake in
[42:50] this battle
[42:51] and he went down there and he went to
[42:52] the water and he said the men that do a
[42:55] certain action
[42:56] he said those are the men that you that
[42:58] you want that you want with you
[43:00] so he seen him and he sent everybody
[43:02] that came
[43:03] and everybody that did the certain
[43:05] action he said i want you to come and
[43:07] join
[43:07] because the lord has called you and
[43:09] positionally placed you for this time in
[43:11] in this battle and they got to the
[43:14] battle and he said
[43:15] god he said well how are we going to do
[43:17] this and the lord gave him a plan he
[43:18] said
[43:19] he said i want you to go get a trumpet
[43:22] and i want you to go get
[43:25] i want you to go get lanterns and
[43:28] vases to put over the lanterns and when
[43:31] it on
[43:31] on my signal i want everyone to blow
[43:34] their trumpets
[43:36] and to break the lances and cause it to
[43:38] light up around the whole
[43:39] we're going to encircle them so they got
[43:41] and they spread out all around
[43:43] the camp the enemy and they got there
[43:46] and they said
[43:47] and and they got there and gideon gave
[43:50] the signal and everyone blew their horn
[43:52] that call to action they blew it and
[43:55] this and
[43:56] the enemy thought that it was more than
[43:57] there was they thought it was way more
[44:00] than people than that was and they
[44:02] started to turn on each other
[44:04] and defeat them on cells they started to
[44:07] take them on
[44:08] selves out so just because the enemy is
[44:10] many don't mean
[44:12] that god can't deliver just because the
[44:14] enemy is coming from every side
[44:16] don't mean that god ain't got a plan to
[44:19] deliver you out of
[44:20] out of them all said elijah was sitting
[44:22] in samaria with his servant
[44:24] and they in the in the sumerians had
[44:26] surrounded them
[44:28] and and and in the servant over there he
[44:30] afraid that
[44:31] there ain't no way we gonna be able to
[44:33] defeat him and guys and elijah said lord
[44:36] open up open up his eyes
[44:43] open up his eyes yeah
[44:46] open up his eyes so that he can see that
[44:49] behind the enemy was the angels of god
[44:53] watching over them and was never going
[44:55] to allow them to destroy
[44:57] the assyrians it was was the enemy
[45:00] and they was watching all over them and
[45:04] he was always there god was always there
[45:07] as the songwriter said he was there all
[45:09] the time
[45:10] waiting patiently in line but god was
[45:12] always there
[45:13] so many times god doesn't leave us but
[45:16] we leave him
[45:18] we step away and we we say lord you know
[45:20] i want to do my thing so i'm going to
[45:22] step over here
[45:24] but but when i get ready i'm going to
[45:25] come back and you know we can still
[45:28] continue to march together
[45:31] and as the as the people say
[45:34] as the older people would say the birds
[45:37] of a feather they flock together
[45:39] and certain people god god god don't
[45:41] want you to be around
[45:42] because he know the influence that
[45:45] they're having on
[45:46] you said something one thing that i
[45:49] realized living life
[45:50] and some things and i said i ain't been
[45:52] here for that long
[45:53] but people that you are around have an
[45:56] effect on you
[45:58] whether you realize it or whether you
[46:00] don't and sometimes we get in situations
[46:02] where
[46:03] oh i'm helping them but don't realize
[46:06] the effect that they having on you
[46:09] and how they're causing you to to think
[46:11] certain things
[46:12] and it is until god separates you from
[46:14] them and you see
[46:16] wow i was in a certain mindset or a
[46:20] certain framework
[46:21] that i didn't even realize how much of
[46:23] an effect those people were having on me
[46:26] that's why that's why it's very it's
[46:28] very cautious if you see anyone
[46:31] in the scripture a lot of times you see
[46:33] them around a certain area
[46:35] any man or god any person of god in the
[46:37] scripture they want to be in a certain
[46:39] atmosphere
[46:40] they want to be in a certain around
[46:42] certain people
[46:44] many times you see that's why they have
[46:46] different things where
[46:47] all these different people come together
[46:50] the minds of the world and different
[46:52] places to all these different
[46:53] to put them all in the same place
[46:55] because they want to be
[46:57] as it was on the day of pentecost to try
[46:59] to get on one accord
[47:01] because the devil knows that if we all
[47:03] get in the same place with the same
[47:04] mindset
[47:06] with our mind on jesus that there's
[47:08] nothing that he can
[47:10] do there's no demon in hell that can
[47:12] overtake any one of god's people
[47:15] there's no demon in hell that could
[47:17] stick that can
[47:18] overtake us because he knows
[47:21] that if you get in that one place with
[47:23] your mind stared on him
[47:25] steadfast on on jesus
[47:30] then there's nothing that he can do to
[47:31] defeat you because you know
[47:33] that god has you you know that you know
[47:36] that
[47:36] lord yes some sometimes
[47:39] as the song said i don't believe he
[47:42] brought me this far just to lead me
[47:44] i don't believe whatever god has brought
[47:46] you through when you've had those real
[47:48] those real moments with god you know
[47:51] that god can continue to take you
[47:52] through
[47:54] amen and there was a centurion in the
[47:57] bible
[47:58] if you look in luke chapter seven
[47:59] there's a centurion in the bible
[48:01] he came to jesus because he felt like he
[48:04] needed to take an action
[48:07] his servant had fallen ill and it was
[48:09] one one of his servants
[48:11] and he said i got to go see jesus
[48:14] and he took that action and he came
[48:16] forward and he said i want to go see
[48:18] jesus because i need i need his help
[48:22] i need his help he he was he felt that
[48:26] call
[48:26] and his action went forth that i need i
[48:29] need to go see jesus
[48:31] and he came to jesus he said lord i
[48:34] paraphrase and he said lord i can
[48:38] he said lord i need i need you to heal
[48:40] my servant i'm just asking that you hear
[48:42] my sermon
[48:44] and when the lord said
[48:48] and the lord said that they're serving
[48:50] as well and he said
[48:51] in in the in the centurion and the lord
[48:54] asked him do you do you need like
[48:56] verification for it
[48:57] he said no he said i know that what you
[49:00] said
[49:02] is going to happen and the lord said i
[49:05] have not found greater faith than even
[49:07] in all of israel
[49:08] i've not found greater faith in all the
[49:11] israel that i
[49:12] that he can just send a word and
[49:15] and and people believe it because there
[49:18] was a call to action he
[49:20] there was a call to this to this to this
[49:22] centurion that
[49:24] he needed to go see jesus because he
[49:26] needed something to take place in his
[49:28] life
[49:28] he needed something to to be handled in
[49:31] his life
[49:32] he needed some situation a situation to
[49:35] be worked out
[49:36] and he knew that the only one that could
[49:37] do it was jesus
[49:40] the only one that could bring him forth
[49:42] was jesus
[49:43] so he and the way that god used it was
[49:46] to say
[49:47] to say a word to speak a word some
[49:50] things god just has to speak a word
[49:52] someone just has to speak a word and god
[49:54] and god will move mountains
[49:56] he said when the when the weakest
[49:58] christian all he has to have is the
[50:00] faith of a mustard seed
[50:02] the faith of a mustard seed and it can
[50:04] move mountains
[50:07] uh they said said one songwriter said
[50:10] you move mountains you cause walls to
[50:12] fall
[50:13] and with your power you perform miracles
[50:16] and there's nothing
[50:19] that's impossible because we're standing
[50:22] here
[50:23] only because you made a way and god has
[50:26] made a way
[50:27] and he has called us to to get down on
[50:30] our knees
[50:31] to pray through to get down there and he
[50:34] has called us to
[50:35] lord get in touch with him because we
[50:37] don't need him
[50:38] it's coming that point in time but we've
[50:40] seen over the last
[50:41] few years that we gonna need god
[50:45] because this world is not going in the
[50:47] upward swing
[50:48] yeah it may i said as you said lord and
[50:52] wrath remember mercy
[50:54] because god god always knows but if it's
[50:56] the time
[50:57] and it's the time for us to get up out
[50:59] of here lord i want to be ready
[51:02] i don't want to be getting ready lord i
[51:04] want to be ready
[51:05] lord i want i want you to i want to be
[51:07] prepared not getting prepared
[51:09] lord i don't want to be packing on my
[51:11] bags and say i'm going on a trip
[51:13] lord i want everything to be ready and
[51:15] say lord if it's my time
[51:17] let me go let me go cause lord you you
[51:19] set
[51:20] you set forth the work that i was
[51:22] supposed to do and you
[51:23] and lord you've accomplished it so it's
[51:26] if it's my time lord
[51:28] accomplish what you said you you were
[51:30] gonna do and call and thank you for
[51:32] calling me to action
[51:34] and that not only that lord let me
[51:36] recognize
[51:37] that you call me that you chose me
[51:41] because it's nothing to miss that call
[51:44] don't miss it
[51:45] don't miss it don't miss the call if god
[51:47] is calling you to take the action
[51:49] take that action yeah it may it may be
[51:52] some trials and some suffering that you
[51:54] have to go through
[51:55] and some sacrifice whenever there's a
[51:57] call there's always sacrifice
[52:00] yeah one one one of my co-workers he
[52:04] said whenever you
[52:06] whenever you say yes to something you're
[52:07] saying no to something
[52:09] else so take for instance
[52:12] if you say yes i can work on this but
[52:15] you already working on something else
[52:17] that means that you're saying no to it
[52:19] so i said lord
[52:21] i don't i want to say yes to jesus and
[52:24] no to the devil
[52:26] i want to say yes to heaven and no to
[52:28] hell
[52:29] lord let me say yes to you and know to

[55:55] that when that experience comes in our
[55:57] life it doesn't come to hurt us it

[56:00] take us back but it comes to build in us
[56:04] character character
