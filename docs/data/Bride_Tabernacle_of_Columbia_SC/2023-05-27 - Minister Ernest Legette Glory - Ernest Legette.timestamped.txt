[38:21] appreciate you and God we give you all
[38:22] the glory in the name of Jesus Christ we
[38:25] pray amen and amen
[38:28] God is good amen we want to look at
[38:31] First Corinthians by the grace of God
[38:33] 10 and we'll begin at the 12th verse
[38:44] first first Corinthians 10 and 12.
[38:52] you got to say Amen
[38:55] and it reads wherefore let him that
[38:58] thinketh he stand to take it take heed
[39:01] lest ye fall there I have no temptation
[39:04] taking you but such as is common to man
[39:07] but God is faithful whom will not suffer
[39:11] you to be tempted above that you are
[39:14] able but will with all with the
[39:17] Temptation also make a way uh make a way
[39:21] to escape that you may be able to Bear
[39:24] it may God have the blessing to read of
[39:25] his word he may be seated I'm going to
[39:28] read a little further down but that that
[39:30] is a consolation to know that you know
[39:33] he says there ain't no temptation taking
[39:35] such as common to man but God is
[39:37] faithful amen and he won't suffer you to
[39:40] go through nothing that you won't be
[39:41] able to bear
[39:42] and he says and even the things that you
[39:45] go through that he allow you to go
[39:47] through it he can also make a way of
[39:49] Escape
[39:50] for you and he says that you may be able
[39:53] to bear
[39:54] so in those times when you're thinking
[39:56] that you can't bear it because you're
[39:58] too weak guard he brought you through it
[40:00] to it like like I said he gonna bring
[40:02] you through it amen
[40:04] and give you that strength to make it
[40:06] through that so you know we always rest
[40:08] in that consolation I was talking I
[40:11] think his brother Jireh the other day
[40:12] was talking about something on the phone
[40:13] I told him I said man I couldn't bear
[40:15] that out he said yeah you could he kept
[40:18] telling me he says that if the Lord
[40:19] allowed it you'll be at a bear I said
[40:22] okay I know I can't bear that I said
[40:24] Lord no I Lord no I can't bear it so he
[40:26] can't allow me to go through it but
[40:28] nevertheless whatever whatever
[40:31] comes in your life you know God God
[40:34] gives us the mentality that you know no
[40:37] matter what comes my way no matter what
[40:39] challenge whatever I got to face I'm
[40:42] going I'm gonna make it through it it
[40:44] might catch me on the worst sometimes
[40:45] but nevertheless I'ma fight my way
[40:48] through it because God has brought me
[40:49] here and this is this is where I'm at
[40:52] and I'm gonna fight my way
[40:54] because God he said he put no more on us
[40:56] than we can Bear right you know I took
[40:58] me back to a time in my mind I was I was
[41:01] saying I said Lord you know what's the
[41:03] worst thing that's going to happen to me
[41:04] in this life and then I began to say you
[41:07] know it don't matter it don't matter
[41:09] what what happens because I was thinking
[41:12] that little song No matter
[41:14] um I mean what comes my way you know no
[41:17] matter you don't have to worry and all
[41:19] those things it says you know because
[41:21] God is going to take care of it so I
[41:23] said no matter what it is you know I
[41:25] know that I can make it I know I can
[41:28] stand no matter what comes my way my
[41:29] life is in his hands I know that so you
[41:32] know that's the consolation that we
[41:34] always uh come back to in our in our
[41:36] minds so you know tonight by the grace
[41:38] of God we want to talk about glory amen
[41:41] and and you know how we we make this um
[41:44] statement all the time it's just a part
[41:47] of our our speaking the the God we want
[41:50] to give you all the glory and a lot of
[41:52] times we're just saying that and it's
[41:54] just became the norm uh to us right so
[41:58] you know and uh I want to read a little
[42:00] further down just go down because I
[42:02] don't want to be too long here let's
[42:04] drop down to the to the 31st verse
[42:08] we're talking about Glory tonight amen
[42:10] to the 31st verse and it reads whether
[42:13] therefore you eat or drink whatsoever
[42:15] you do do all to the glory of God give
[42:20] none offense neither to the Jews nor
[42:21] Gentiles nor the Church of God even as I
[42:25] please all men in all things not uh
[42:27] seeking my own Prophet but the prophet
[42:30] of many that they may be saved but I
[42:33] want to dwell on that part you know
[42:34] because he was talking about a lot of
[42:36] things that you can go home and read it
[42:37] sometimes you know but he was talking
[42:39] about you know how to conduct yourself
[42:41] when you go amongst the Gentiles you
[42:43] know whatever a man put before you eat
[42:45] you know and he says if we've been
[42:47] sacrificed to Idols don't eat it he says
[42:50] but you know don't offend many but
[42:51] always try to think on the next man and
[42:55] not not on yourselves you know and then
[42:57] you begin to I like a little one place
[42:59] that kind of stuck to me how he was
[43:01] saying you know you can't eat at God's
[43:03] table and at the devil's table also he
[43:05] said you can't drink from the cup of the
[43:07] Lord and drink from the cup of the devil
[43:09] too you can't do that so you know those
[43:12] those things you know just kind of stick
[43:13] out to you but or he was as he was going
[43:16] on just talking about how to conduct
[43:18] yourself and things but he was saying no
[43:20] matter what you do eat or drink or
[43:22] whatever you do let it be to the glory
[43:24] of God and you know I was I was praying
[43:27] the other day and then and it just
[43:29] dropped in my spirit I said Lord I was
[43:31] saying to myself I said Lord you know no
[43:33] matter what I do or what I become in
[43:35] this life I want you to get the glory
[43:37] out of it and that's what it is I said
[43:39] Lord I want you to get the glory out of
[43:41] whatever whatever I do or become no
[43:44] matter what it is Lord I want you to get
[43:46] the glory out of my life you know
[43:48] sometimes you think uh uh you know you
[43:51] got to be you know I guess out in
[43:54] Forefront the scene and all these things
[43:55] for God to get Glory but God wants glory
[43:58] out of your life
[44:00] he won't and I says God I wanna I wanna
[44:03] give you the glory and it's like I said
[44:05] something dropped in my spirit I can
[44:07] hear the Lord saying to me the glory
[44:10] that that that I what I call Glory ain't
[44:13] what you thinking of Glory is
[44:16] you know sometimes we look at glory it's
[44:18] just as you know the power and all these
[44:21] things but he says I'm is sending me in
[44:23] one in my spirit you know I could show
[44:25] imma show you what glory is
[44:27] so I began to think about it I said you
[44:29] know when you think about Glory we're
[44:31] saying it we're looking at it as the
[44:33] praise or worship offered in
[44:35] Thanksgiving to deity
[44:37] you know praise or worship but I say is
[44:40] that you know God's path to Glory a lot
[44:43] of times you know like he says it ain't
[44:45] it ain't our path and what we're looking
[44:47] at I thought about you know uh just as a
[44:50] people the Roman people at Point what
[44:52] their where they've always sought out
[44:55] there was glory and they most time they
[44:56] sought out there on the battlefield so
[44:58] when they went to battle it was whoever
[45:00] won as many battles the most battles
[45:03] they were the most powerful neither ones
[45:05] had the most what they call it glory and
[45:07] then they would sometimes call
[45:09] themselves to be divine and all because
[45:11] of the battles that they won they saw it
[45:14] sought out the uh Power and that and
[45:16] they thought that you know that's
[45:18] getting that kind of Glory you know
[45:20] you'll be I guess um
[45:22] lifted up in front of men so they
[45:25] enjoyed that they lustered after that
[45:27] kind of glory and I started thought
[45:28] about that I said you know those Spirits
[45:31] are still here today that's why you know
[45:33] even themselves they were cut throats
[45:35] they were they would uh cut each other's
[45:37] throat just to become the emperor just
[45:39] to become consulate and all you know
[45:41] friends would turn against each other
[45:42] and all why because they wanted that
[45:44] Glory they wanted to beat that power and
[45:47] even though you know like I said those
[45:49] Spirits it even dwells in the church
[45:51] today it dwells there you know people
[45:54] say God I want you to get all the glory
[45:56] but yet they want they want themselves
[45:58] to be out in the Forefront and then you
[46:00] know what those
[46:02] same way they carried out the natural
[46:03] they do it in the spirit just cut people
[46:05] down Cut You Down whatever those things
[46:08] why to try to get the glory but I said
[46:10] you know God assured me that ain't the
[46:12] glory you know the the path when God the
[46:15] glory that God uh wants out your life
[46:17] ain't that type of Glory come on I was
[46:20] thinking about so many characters in The
[46:22] Bible and and I says you know God the
[46:25] glory that the path to the glory you
[46:28] know I thought about Joseph yes he could
[46:29] he had a gift that he dreamed dreams and
[46:32] interpret dreams and all those things
[46:34] that in itself seemed to be a special
[46:36] gift but the glory how did God get
[46:39] Gloria out of that you know and a lot of
[46:42] times it was through the things that he
[46:43] suffered you know that gift that he had
[46:46] caused his own Brothers to hate him
[46:48] because of that gift that he had didn't
[46:50] he you know and I thought about that I
[46:52] said what happens a lot of times God
[46:55] began to stir on your heart something
[46:57] and I said you know what happened uh
[47:00] Spirits jealousy all these things that
[47:02] come against us fight against you a lot
[47:05] of times it'll be your own family
[47:06] friends whatever whether they fight
[47:08] against you and all it is because it
[47:11] ain't them it ain't the people but it's
[47:13] Spirits because they know that God is
[47:15] one you you're trying to carry out what
[47:17] the will of God is for your life and the
[47:20] devil's job is to stop you he don't want
[47:22] you to carry out the will of God for
[47:24] your life so he'll use in anybody and
[47:27] anything he can to stop the will of God
[47:29] and it cause you to start fighting
[47:31] against people fighting against that one
[47:33] right there why are you fighting against
[47:34] them because you're thinking it's them
[47:36] but what it is it's the devil the whole
[47:38] time and you can't afford allow yourself
[47:40] to get engaged in in that type of
[47:43] warfare combat like that because then
[47:46] you won't be carrying out what the will
[47:47] of God is for your life but once God put
[47:50] something in your heart and you know
[47:52] what uh God is is requiring a calling
[47:55] throughout your life you got to have
[47:57] your eyes single on that what God has
[47:59] called you for come on and stay with it
[48:02] I believe that you know Laura was
[48:04] showing me showing me something you know
[48:06] the other day and I said it's God that's
[48:08] what it is sometimes we'll fight fight
[48:10] against this and that one but if it's
[48:13] the Lord you know and you ain't gonna
[48:14] better stop it but if it if it ain't him
[48:17] it won't come to nothing but
[48:19] nevertheless what it is I said God I
[48:21] want you to get the glory out of my life
[48:23] Lord I don't want to be in confrontation
[48:25] with all uh spirits and all you know
[48:27] you're going to have to I says but
[48:29] whatever it is God I want my I want to
[48:31] be single I want my eyes to stay focused
[48:35] oh God what you put in my heart to do
[48:37] what you what you called me for that's
[48:39] all I want to do God I just wanna and
[48:42] then that way I know you getting the
[48:43] glory out of it it ain't me but it's God
[48:46] getting the glory out of my life how
[48:48] many want that tonight but I say is that
[48:50] you know Joseph couldn't help that that
[48:52] the gift that he had could he but it
[48:56] brought about a bunch of jealousy and
[48:58] stuff didn't it it would cause his own
[49:00] Brothers selling but you know I said I
[49:03] wasn't saying that the glory I mean it
[49:06] was just in the gift but when when he
[49:08] can go and and be sold to um to Egypt
[49:12] and be lied on Hallelujah and get thrown
[49:15] in jail not only even in the midst of
[49:18] that he didn't lose his testimony did he
[49:20] even in the midst of that he still
[49:22] wanted God to get Glory out his life he
[49:25] could have stopped right there and says
[49:28] well this gift that God gave me is what
[49:30] got me into trouble I'm in now but no
[49:32] even in the jail he was still using the
[49:34] gift that God gave him interpreting
[49:37] dreams and so forth but God had a place
[49:39] to use that gift didn't he but when it
[49:41] came out what it was God God got Glory
[49:44] out of Joseph's life and it wasn't
[49:46] nothing that Joseph uh done to make
[49:49] himself
[49:50] so great and all these things but it was
[49:53] God that took him that gave him that
[49:55] gift and God took him down that path
[49:57] that road which I believe was a
[50:00] character building process
[50:02] go through all these things and why me
[50:05] Lord why I got to go through why I got
[50:07] to suffer these things but nevertheless
[50:09] he still I believe found a way to give
[50:11] God glory and all of that
[50:13] and in the very end he's his brother
[50:16] says that you know there was a a word
[50:18] about him getting revenge but he said no
[50:21] it wasn't you but it was God that sent
[50:23] me
[50:25] it was God the whole time because he he
[50:28] knew what was coming ahead and he wanted
[50:30] people to be saved
[50:32] so he took me down that road I had to
[50:35] suffer the things I had to suffer now I
[50:38] can see the tender hand of God the mercy
[50:41] of God and all these things I understand
[50:43] what it's all about now
[50:45] I know what it's like to be lied on
[50:47] cheated talked about mistreated like
[50:50] they said you know what that's like and
[50:52] I know how to forgive God's glory was in
[50:54] forgiveness
[50:56] God's glory was in that
[50:59] I believe it
[51:01] I said but what it is the glory come on
[51:03] God says his path to glory in our path
[51:06] right Moses was born to Prophet Prophet
[51:09] child and all those things had something
[51:12] that God wanted to do in his life but
[51:14] that wasn't necessarily the way the
[51:16] glory was but God waited till he got to
[51:19] be 80 years old
[51:21] right because he could have did it in
[51:23] his strength in his Youth and all that
[51:24] no he waited till he got to be 80 years
[51:26] old weak right can't hardly talking all
[51:30] these things now God said now I'ma send
[51:33] you
[51:34] and even looking at that didn't even
[51:37] look sensible reasonable and it I can
[51:39] hear in the scriptures you know Moses
[51:41] saying I can't talk right I can't talk I
[51:45] can't we just paraphrase can't hold it
[51:47] walk how you gonna send me look like if
[51:49] you to use me you'd use me when I was
[51:51] strong
[51:52] sometimes in our spirit we get that way
[51:54] God why you didn't use me in the good
[51:56] times when I was up on the mountain God
[51:58] why you didn't use me then come on but
[52:01] when where the glory of God is is when
[52:04] you at your weakest
[52:06] when you down and out
[52:09] when you when you ain't in the good
[52:11] times
[52:12] but when you all alone by yourself
[52:15] when you you realize you can't do the
[52:18] job you ain't even counting yourself
[52:20] worthy to be even to be called to do the
[52:23] job but that's where the glory of God
[52:25] shows up
[52:26] and he says that who made man's mouth
[52:29] damn come on I'm sending you I'm gonna
[52:31] use that you where I want to get Glory
[52:33] out of now so the glory wasn't
[52:35] necessarily in him being a prophet of
[52:37] who he was but God did it didn't he God
[52:41] or got him into that place and the path
[52:44] to Glory was a hard path but
[52:46] nevertheless to God be all the glory you
[52:48] look at Abraham's life oh 100 years old
[52:51] and all these things dried up but see
[52:53] what it is when you look at lives you're
[52:56] necessarily not looking at all the acts
[52:59] and the power they did but you looking
[53:00] at what God did for their lives and
[53:03] you're looking at how God took nothing
[53:05] and he turned it into something you look
[53:07] at how God took the the rejected the
[53:10] cast out the ones that was uh uh
[53:13] rejected by the world and he took them
[53:15] and he used them because they saw
[53:17] themselves not worthy Hallelujah oh
[53:20] Jesus but God got Glory out of it and
[53:23] it's easy to give God glory when you
[53:26] realize that it was no way possible it
[53:29] was nothing that you could do to help
[53:31] Salvage the situation
[53:34] when you know that it is nothing the
[53:36] doctors couldn't help you nobody
[53:38] couldn't help you
[53:39] friends because when you realize that
[53:41] the situation was over
[53:44] and all of a sudden something changed
[53:46] just overnight
[53:48] the quickening Spirit came the power
[53:50] came is different it's easy to give God
[53:54] glory then because you can look at it
[53:56] and say God I know it wasn't me
[53:58] I know it wasn't me ain't had nothing
[54:00] God that was you Lord
[54:02] when somebody asks you how you can't
[54:04] even mention yourself all you can do is
[54:06] talk about God
[54:09] it was God that did it it was God that
[54:12] brought me out it was God that took care
[54:13] it was God that watched over it was God
[54:15] that blessed me
[54:17] I had done given up but God showed up
[54:20] Hallelujah and I want to give him glory
[54:23] Hallelujah come on
[54:25] but I say it's the glory you know
[54:28] God the way we look at glory sometimes a
[54:31] lot of times ain't ain't you know what
[54:34] God God I like how he told Gideon he
[54:37] says that I don't want you to go down to
[54:40] all the men for them to think that they
[54:41] won the battle on themselves
[54:43] because God wanted to get Glory out the
[54:45] situation didn't he so he said I'm gonna
[54:47] take with these 300 but these these 300
[54:51] right here I'm gonna take them and I'm
[54:53] gonna go down there and I'm Gonna Give
[54:54] You Deliverance so when it's talked
[54:56] about years from now Hallelujah
[54:58] centuries from now they'll know that it
[55:01] was God that did it
[55:03] it wasn't man was no other no no no no
[55:06] great General devising the plan
[55:08] but it was God that did it God got Glory
[55:12] you know God wants some people that's
[55:13] going to give him glory God wants a man
[55:16] that he can use that he he won't have
[55:18] himself in the way a word about that's
[55:21] why Paul said thinking on himself don't
[55:23] think on Paul gave his life that others
[55:26] might you know he gave his life and his
[55:28] whole living all that sacrifice
[55:30] everything that he might see uh Souls
[55:34] come to the kingdom of God
[55:36] souls to be genuinely saved he might
[55:39] like it says been the priest and all
[55:41] that but he gave all that up because he
[55:44] saw it as as he says in one place he
[55:47] says I glory in my infirmities
[55:49] that the the power of Christ might dwell
[55:52] in me come on
[55:54] all my infirmities that's where God is
[55:57] getting the glory out of my life
[55:59] oh Hallelujah when I met my weakest
[56:02] that's when God is getting the glory so
[56:05] when I'm uh can't Holly got these things
[56:07] and I'm praying that God will take it
[56:09] away from him but no I realize God is
[56:12] getting Glory out of it because he
[56:14] helping me that I won't see myself
[56:16] higher than what I ought to be or think
[56:19] of myself higher than what I ought to be
[56:21] but he's keeping me at a level of
[56:23] humility
[56:24] the one the level of humility that I
[56:27] need to walk on for his power to be in
[56:29] my life Hallelujah I said God that's
[56:32] what I want oh sometimes we can we can
[56:35] bring about those things on ourselves
[56:37] but God said that ain't the glory I'm
[56:38] talking about
[56:40] out there thought about Luther and how
[56:42] you joined the the most strictest uh sex
[56:45] of monks and all
[56:47] whipping himself and doing all these
[56:49] things right to try to uh uh emulate or
[56:53] whatever the sufferings of Christ but he
[56:55] realized that ain't what God wanted
[56:57] God wanted a surrender heart God wanted
[57:00] to surrender life
[57:02] a child that no matter what he asked him
[57:04] to do they'll be willing to do it no
[57:07] matter what he asks them to give up
[57:08] they'll be willing to give up
[57:10] Hallelujah and they won't look to God as
[57:13] if he owe them nothing because they know
[57:15] that they owe him everything
[57:18] you know that's what we always says God
[57:20] don't owe us nothing but we owe him
[57:22] everything we owe him our life we owe
[57:25] him our souls Body Spirit we owe him all
[57:28] because he's the only reason we got the
[57:31] Breath of Life he's the only reason we
[57:33] ain't Dead and Gone he's the only reason
[57:36] we're in good health he's the only
[57:38] reason we were able to walk in the
[57:40] Church of God tonight so we owe him
[57:42] everything
[57:44] come on
[57:45] Hallelujah but it says you know I was
[57:48] thinking about going over that you know
[57:50] it was in my spirit says that you know
[57:53] he says I'm gonna show you the path to
[57:54] glory and I see how Christ the Bible
[57:58] says he left of himself of what no
[58:00] reputation right
[58:02] whoa he says you know he could have came
[58:05] down in a certain way but no he wanted
[58:07] to show you where his glory way God was
[58:09] getting Glory at where a man that didn't
[58:11] look like he was nothing
[58:13] right walking like it says with dirty
[58:16] feet maybe didn't look like he was
[58:18] nothing
[58:19] I thought about it when I was in prayer
[58:22] I said you know Jesus standing there
[58:25] before Pilate knows
[58:27] with blood dripping down his face with a
[58:29] crown of thorns on his head with a robe
[58:32] wrapped around him with dirty feet
[58:35] maybe bruises and all didn't look like
[58:38] much did it
[58:40] but they didn't know who was standing in
[58:42] front of him
[58:43] I said if they would only knew who that
[58:45] was behind all of that
[58:48] if they would only knew who they had
[58:49] standing right there in front of them
[58:51] but in all of that God was getting Glory
[58:54] out of it
[58:55] he said he glorified his name he said
[58:57] I'll glorified again God was getting
[58:59] Glory out of that
[59:00] he showed how low he could get
[59:02] Hallelujah
[59:04] oh Jesus I said they only had a no it
[59:07] didn't look like much that was standing
[59:09] right there in front of him didn't look
[59:11] like much God could have came down like
[59:13] it said all the style and all these
[59:15] things made a big scenery no but he he
[59:17] was showing you where his glory was at
[59:20] in the things that that that's uh uh uh
[59:22] well overlooked most of the time
[59:25] but he was showing you where his glory
[59:27] was at Hallelujah you know I was
[59:29] thinking about today
[59:31] I said you know
[59:33] God wants to get the glory out of life
[59:35] right I thought about Samson and how you
[59:38] know he was a Nazarite from birth
[59:41] and you know God raised him up for the
[59:44] purpose you know you could have said
[59:46] what God was using I mean the anointing
[59:47] would come on him and God was getting
[59:49] Glory yes God was using them but where
[59:52] the real glory came
[59:54] was when he had fallen come on God
[59:57] didn't put him in that place he ended up
[59:59] at his sins put him there his lust put
[1:00:02] him there but you know God even in that
[1:00:05] was going to get Glory out of it with
[1:00:07] his hair his locks chopped off I like
[1:00:10] how the Bible says but they started
[1:00:12] growing again
[1:00:14] Hallelujah God was getting ready to get
[1:00:16] Glory he was getting ready to show you
[1:00:18] he was getting ready to show that he
[1:00:20] even uh Samson know he was in a back
[1:00:23] sliding state that if that heart
[1:00:25] could genuinely come to repentance
[1:00:28] come on call out to God he said Lord
[1:00:31] just remember me but what it is even in
[1:00:34] that he says Lord let me die with my
[1:00:37] enemies come on
[1:00:39] and in that time he killed more it was
[1:00:42] talked about you know you we know he
[1:00:43] talked about him killing the lion and
[1:00:45] him pulling the gates up him doing all
[1:00:48] these uh mighty things that he's done
[1:00:51] but when you think about Samson you
[1:00:53] think about how his hair got chopped off
[1:00:54] for the most part his eyes got plucked
[1:00:57] out he's standing be in uh holding on to
[1:01:00] the pillars
[1:01:01] a backslidden state but a man even in
[1:01:04] that backsliding state with a genuine
[1:01:07] repentance calling out to God
[1:01:09] God heard him and remembered them didn't
[1:01:12] he and God glory out his life come on
[1:01:15] Hallelujah oh God I said Lord what it is
[1:01:19] you know the path to Glory he says I
[1:01:22] want to show you that that path to Glory
[1:01:23] It Ain't Easy come on it's a hard path
[1:01:28] and it's a pal that's that that that's
[1:01:30] painful
[1:01:32] painstaking a lot of times I says you
[1:01:34] know even in the younger younger
[1:01:36] Ministry you know sometimes you look at
[1:01:39] the older Saints or whatever all the
[1:01:41] Ministries and you might say Marvel at
[1:01:44] the certain things or but you don't
[1:01:47] understand that a lot of things came
[1:01:49] through suffering too a lot of things
[1:01:51] came through trials and tribulations
[1:01:54] ups and downs you didn't just get the
[1:01:56] they didn't just get the anointing and
[1:01:58] be able to walk with such wisdom and all
[1:02:00] that overnight
[1:02:01] but what happened you know God brought
[1:02:04] them through some things
[1:02:06] and when they came out because maybe you
[1:02:09] know sometimes you can feel like oh I'm
[1:02:11] I can play I could preach I could do
[1:02:13] whatever you know and maybe and maybe
[1:02:16] you can because of the gift that God
[1:02:17] gave you but he won't get his glory out
[1:02:20] of it how the glory comes a lot of times
[1:02:23] you got you give your life really over
[1:02:25] to the Lord and it ain't you speaking
[1:02:27] but it's God speaking come on but he
[1:02:29] takes you through some things
[1:02:31] he humbles you down a little bit
[1:02:34] brings you to that point Hallelujah The
[1:02:37] Way You Feel So Unworthy
[1:02:40] you feel like it God I can't do the job
[1:02:44] I don't know how to handle this
[1:02:45] situation what it is God brought you
[1:02:47] there sometimes you can say that from
[1:02:49] your mouth but it's it's a difference
[1:02:52] when God brought you there
[1:02:54] difference when God took you through
[1:02:56] something
[1:02:56] Hallelujah then he shows up y'all
[1:02:59] believe that tonight I believe it come
[1:03:01] on but I said you know what it is the
[1:03:04] glory you know we think about that Paul
[1:03:07] he's saying no matter what no matter
[1:03:08] what you do right
[1:03:10] do it all for the glory of God
[1:03:13] it says most of the time the glory of
[1:03:15] God is is mostly often you know
[1:03:18] associated with suffering
[1:03:20] and all those things I says but what it
[1:03:22] is you know God wants to get Glory out
[1:03:25] of your life
[1:03:26] a lot of times like we always talk about
[1:03:27] people say I want to be like Paul but
[1:03:30] you just want the glory and the power
[1:03:31] looking at it from that standpoint but
[1:03:34] look at all look at the suffering that
[1:03:35] he had to go through look at look at the
[1:03:37] life
[1:03:38] that had to be lived Hallelujah but you
[1:03:41] don't put yourself through those things
[1:03:43] you don't devise up sufferings for
[1:03:46] yourself come on but your job is just
[1:03:49] yield yourself as a vessel to God
[1:03:52] Lord I just want to do your will
[1:03:54] whatever comes my way just give me uh
[1:03:57] like he says uh uh uh make me able to
[1:03:59] Bear it God make a way for escape for me

[1:04:06] come to that no matter what part you got
[1:04:08] for my life no matter what you're
[1:04:10] calling me to God no matter what it is
[1:04:12] Lord let me do it with all of my heart
[1:04:15] let me get out of the way Lord and let
[1:04:17] you have your way in my life come on no
[1:04:20] matter what tomorrow might bring because
[1:04:21] in the end all I want I want to make it
[1:04:23] to Heaven I want to make I want I don't
[1:04:25] want my soul to be lost
[1:04:27] I want to hear you say Well done not
[1:04:30] good and faithful my good and faithful
[1:04:32] servant of God I want to hear those
[1:04:33] words
[1:04:34] help me to get out of the way
[1:04:36] you know a lot of times that's the
[1:04:38] struggle that's the battle we get out of
[1:04:40] the way
[1:04:42] we in the way our feelings in a way we
[1:04:44] get hurt feelings hurt everything why
[1:04:46] because you were in the way
[1:04:48] but when you get out of the way
[1:04:51] and let God
[1:04:52] get Glory out of your life
[1:04:54] in the shameness
[1:04:56] in the in the rejection come on that's
[1:04:59] where God gonna get Glory out of it come
[1:05:02] on and all of that God will get Glory
[1:05:04] out of how many believe that tonight I
[1:05:06] said come on the glory of God how many
[1:05:08] want to give God glory tonight we say it
[1:05:11] often all the times Lord I want to we're
[1:05:13] going to give you all the glory and all
[1:05:15] these things it just becomes a phrase or
[1:05:18] saying sometimes it's just
[1:05:20] self-conscious or whatever say those
[1:05:22] things but nevertheless in our hearts in
[1:05:25] your heart you really want to give God
[1:05:27] glory well no matter what comes your way
[1:05:30] you got to be willing to let God use you
[1:05:33] and get out of the way like I said what
[1:05:35] happens a lot of times when you come to
[1:05:37] that place you know and you doing what
[1:05:41] God asks you to do or or what God is
[1:05:43] leading you you know the devil he he
[1:05:45] don't want to see you in that place
[1:05:47] because he know that's where God gonna
[1:05:48] bless you at
[1:05:50] he know that's where your blessings are
[1:05:52] he knows I swear where others are going
[1:05:54] to be blessed at so he don't want to see
[1:05:56] you in that position he don't want to
[1:05:57] see you in that place come on so you use
[1:06:00] any and everything you will to keep you
[1:06:02] tied up conversation and all that way
[1:06:04] you can't be effective in the house of
[1:06:06] God or in the kingdom of God but to
[1:06:08] understand
[1:06:10] that we're we're not men Pleasers but
[1:06:12] we're here to please God
[1:06:14] and no matter what God I want to do your
[1:06:17] will I just want to please you Lord no
[1:06:20] matter what my what you calling me for
[1:06:22] whatever God I want to please you
[1:06:24] I might not never be to sometimes
[1:06:27] well-known person and all these things
[1:06:29] the biggest uh preacher and all but I
[1:06:33] just want to please God
[1:06:35] I just want to see souls coming to the
[1:06:37] kingdom
[1:06:38] if all he got was just a testimony that
[1:06:41] God gave you I want to tell that
[1:06:42] testimony of God
[1:06:44] what he gave me all I want to do is tell
[1:06:48] somebody about what God did for me
[1:06:50] because I'm still excited I'm glad that
[1:06:53] God saved me I'm glad that he picked me
[1:06:55] up turned my life around changed me from
[1:06:58] who I was
[1:07:00] I'm glad Hallelujah are you glad tonight
[1:07:02] amen
[1:07:14] praise God Amen
[1:07:17] I was just thinking the days I was
[1:07:20] reading and prophet of God says to the
[1:07:24] young ministers and the young this is
[1:07:27] not only the young ministers young
[1:07:28] people he said one thing you must
[1:07:32] understand you must understand
[1:07:36] and he was talking to the young
[1:07:38] ministers
[1:07:39] and he was saying not only the young
[1:07:42] people but
[1:07:43] the oldest likewise
[1:07:46] he said one thing you must do
[1:07:48] you must do
[1:07:50] he said you must
[1:07:52] be able to
[1:07:54] Master human ability
[1:07:58] he said you must be able to master human
[1:08:01] ability
[1:08:03] and that's what I was listening to
[1:08:05] brother Ernie's and he said
[1:08:08] you must be able to master human ability
[1:08:14] and he said
[1:08:16] that when you say you can do the job
[1:08:20] do your own when you think you're strong
[1:08:23] enough or you intelligent enough and you
[1:08:26] think you can do it
[1:08:34] you can't trust your own ability
[1:08:38] because you can't do the job Moses tried
[1:08:40] to do it
[1:08:43] then he had to flee
[1:08:47] you must learn to master
[1:08:51] human ability
[1:08:54] and I was just hearing that
[1:08:56] through the message tonight
[1:08:59] you must Master human ability when you
[1:09:02] say I can do it
[1:09:07] you'll never please God you'll never be
[1:09:09] able you'll always be a failure
[1:09:12] but you realize
[1:09:15] he said God want to use those to know
[1:09:21] you want to use those that know they
[1:09:23] can't do the job
[1:09:28] once you know amen without God it's
[1:09:32] impossible
[1:09:35] to do the job but when you know through
[1:09:37] your own human ability then you can do
[1:09:39] it
[1:09:40] you see you've been you're getting ready
[1:09:42] to make a mess
[1:09:44] you're getting ready to fail
[1:09:46] because you're going to trust in your
[1:09:48] own human ability your own knowledge
[1:09:51] your own wisdom your own's
[1:09:53] strength you're gonna trust in that
[1:09:57] and when we trust in our ability
[1:10:00] and our own strength and our own
[1:10:02] intelligence
[1:10:06] it's not how intelligently we are how
[1:10:08] smart we are
[1:10:12] but God
[1:10:15] the praise God want to get the glory his
[1:10:17] brother Ernest said
[1:10:21] gotta let you get to the point
[1:10:24] that you were told of failure like Saul
[1:10:26] when he went down to the masses
[1:10:29] you had all it took human intelligence
[1:10:32] and all of that
[1:10:34] but God let a light shine from heaven
[1:10:37] and he fell to the Earth
[1:10:39] and he was blind
[1:10:42] and he said Lord what would you have me
[1:10:44] to do
[1:10:46] are you up here
[1:10:48] that's what God want to do in our lives
[1:10:53] if we're not careful
[1:10:56] we'll be trying to do
[1:10:59] for ourselves
[1:11:01] and not let God do it
[1:11:06] we'll do it with our own human effort
[1:11:09] our own intelligence
[1:11:12] but we won't let God
[1:11:15] Spirit have control
[1:11:20] if you let God's spirit have control
[1:11:23] you'll find you the father up the road
[1:11:28] but when we think that we can do the job
[1:11:33] oh yes I know what I'm doing I can do it
[1:11:37] yes go right ahead
[1:11:40] but God would never accept human
[1:11:43] ability
[1:11:46] it's got to be totally God
[1:11:49] said we got to be willing to surrender
[1:11:52] all
[1:11:56] we got to see ourselves in nothing but
[1:11:58] God you everything
[1:12:01] God I'm nothing
[1:12:04] but you all in all
[1:12:08] but we see ourselves to be strong
[1:12:14] I can do that I can do it no you can't
[1:12:19] I know what I'm doing I know how to do
[1:12:21] it
[1:12:22] no you don't
[1:12:24] I know what I'm doing I know what I want
[1:12:28] what does God want
[1:12:33] does he want
[1:12:35] think about it brother sister
[1:12:38] brother Ernest had to come with that
[1:12:40] message
[1:12:42] and then have me reading the same thing
[1:12:44] today
[1:12:46] listen to what the prophet said
[1:12:49] I trust that God spoke to you and the
[1:12:53] day maybe he spoke
[1:12:54] wanted me to hear that
[1:12:57] they're confirmed
[1:13:00] we got the one thing we must do
[1:13:04] is to master human ability
[1:13:06] when you get ready to do something Lord
[1:13:11] I can
[1:13:13] but you can
[1:13:17] everything whatsoever you do in word or
[1:13:21] indeed do it all into what
[1:13:25] the name of Jesus
[1:13:28] realizing if I'm doing it Lord let me do
[1:13:31] it in your name where you can get the
[1:13:33] glory
[1:13:35] but if we're looking for the glory
[1:13:44] that's the carnal mind
[1:13:47] and God is good amen
[1:13:50] I love him let us stand thank God
[1:13:53] forever wolf tonight
[1:13:55] praise God God is good

[1:14:14] Hallelujah y'all seem tired in here
[1:14:17] praise God we didn't have but a few
[1:14:20] people last night in Mullins but
[1:14:23] God really
[1:14:25] come down and
[1:14:28] I believe God was speaking tonight
[1:14:31] I really believe God's speaking
[1:14:34] let's Master human ability okay
[1:14:40] anytime we get ourselves that we can do
[1:14:42] it
[1:14:45] stop and start praying God let me get
[1:14:49] out the way
[1:14:51] let me get out your way
[1:14:53] and let you do it
[1:14:58] he said young ministers young people
[1:15:02] we know what we how to do what we want
[1:15:04] done
[1:15:06] no we can let God do it

[1:15:33] it being your will
[1:15:36] Hallelujah
[1:15:39] somebody in all their human abilities
[1:15:41] think that I can get the job done
[1:15:46] yes I can get it done
[1:15:50] Hallelujah
[1:15:52] but you can
[1:15:58] so many times we'll fail God
[1:16:04] because we were trying to do it on our
[1:16:06] own
[1:16:08] but let's believe God today
[1:16:11] how many want to move out the way and
[1:16:13] let God have his way in your life

[1:16:20] trust in your ability God
