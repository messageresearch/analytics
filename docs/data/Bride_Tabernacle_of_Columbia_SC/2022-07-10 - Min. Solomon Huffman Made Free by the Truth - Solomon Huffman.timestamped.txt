[37:17] amen we're just happy to be a christian
[37:19] this morning aren't you
[37:21] amen so may god bless you uh the book of
[37:23] john in the eighth chapter
[37:25] i will read the 31st down to the 34th
[37:27] the bible i would read this and say
[37:29] jesus to those jews which believed on
[37:31] him
[37:32] if you continue in my word then are you
[37:34] my disciples indeed
[37:37] and ye shall know the truth and the
[37:39] truth shall make you free
[37:41] amen you shall know the truth and the
[37:43] truth shall make you free then they
[37:46] answered him we be abraham's seed and
[37:48] we're never in bondage to any man
[37:51] how says thou ye shall be made free and
[37:53] jesus answered them verily verily i say
[37:56] unto you whosoever committeth sin
[37:59] is the servant of sin amen whosoever
[38:02] committeth sin is the servant of sin we
[38:04] ask that god will bless his word as you
[38:06] can be seated
[38:08] and just for a few minutes of time this
[38:09] morning i want to speak to you on the
[38:11] subject of made free by the truth
[38:14] a man made free by the truth how many
[38:17] believes
[38:18] according to the scripture that the
[38:20] truth makes us free is that right amen
[38:23] the bible said you shall know the truth
[38:25] and the truth shall make you free and i
[38:28] just love the way that the bible reads
[38:29] that amen the bible doesn't say that the
[38:32] truth shall make you bound or the the
[38:34] truth shall make you in fear the truth
[38:36] shall bring you in bondage but the bible
[38:39] tells us that the truth of god makes us
[38:41] free and and so you you can never have
[38:44] any other product but freedom
[38:46] when you have the truth is that right
[38:48] amen you can't have bondage when you're
[38:50] underneath the truth you you can't have
[38:52] uh you you can't be bound when you're
[38:55] underneath the truth because amen the
[38:57] truth of the word of almighty god is
[38:59] what makes us free now now we all know
[39:01] that we live in an age that is blind
[39:03] miserable naked and knows it not amen
[39:06] the age that we're living in everybody
[39:08] thinks that they're right everybody's

[43:45] on to realize that when we read this
[43:48] bible and we have the truth of the word
[43:50] of almighty god amen we can come to god
[43:53] with such a boldness
[43:55] amen that's why the bible said in the
[43:56] book of hebrews come to god boldly
[43:59] amen come to us from boldly knowing that
[44:02] he must stand behind his word
[44:05] i tell you i rejoice in that to realize
[44:08] amen that the very creator of the
[44:10] heavens
[44:11] he's placed handcuffs on himself
[44:16] he's placed handcuffs on himself he
[44:18] literally and see he don't mind doing it
[44:21] either he don't mind binding himself to
[44:23] his own word
[44:25] it's amazing to realize that god he's
[44:28] handcuffed himself to where he is
[44:30] duty-bound obligated
[44:33] to his own word
[44:34] amen so when you come to almighty god in
[44:37] prayer and say god you promised this

[44:43] sick you are bound to your truth
[44:46] hallelujah
[44:47] amen god when you said that we could
[44:49] pray
[44:50] and you would hear from heaven he's
[44:52] obligated to give ear
[44:56] preach with me somebody he's obligated
[44:59] to give ear to your prayer
[45:01] he has made himself duty bound obligated
[45:05] amen to his own word and i'll say this
[45:08] he doesn't mind being bound to his own
[45:10] word but god wants to fulfill his word
[45:12] and your life
[45:14] he's not amen he ain't ashamed to have
[45:16] to stand behind it because it's the
[45:18] truth and he wants to stand behind his
[45:21] own word he's just looking for somebody
[45:23] to get bold enough
[45:26] i said he's looking for somebody to get
[45:28] bold enough that would say god this is
[45:31] the truth and this is your word and i'm
[45:34] gonna stand on out on your truth because
[45:37] i know your god and in you is no lie in
[45:41] you is no deception and you must stand
[45:44] behind the truth i know that you'll do
[45:47] it oh yeah what what about it this
[45:50] morning i mean what if god got some of
[45:52] his children to step out on the truth
[45:54] and say god i'm gonna believe you for my
[45:56] healing i'm gonna believe you from my
[45:58] family i believe you from my church
[46:01] i'm gonna believe you for this issue
[46:03] amen try the lord this morning
[46:06] and see if he's able

[46:13] see if he's able to do what he said he
[46:16] would do i'll say time and time again
[46:19] he will stand with his word
[46:28] thank you sir
[46:29] i said he'll stand with his word
[46:33] the truth shall make you free
[46:37] so you see the truth don't mind you
[46:40] is that right
[46:41] the truth does not bind the believer
[46:44] now i know there's there's preachers
[46:45] there's men through the ages they've
[46:47] took this bible they made condemnation
[46:50] you know what i'm talking about they've
[46:52] took the word they took the
[46:54] unadulterated truth of god
[46:57] and they put minds on people
[46:59] they bound them with fear they bound
[47:01] them with fears they bound them with sad
[47:03] but god never intended for his word
[47:07] to be used to bind anybody
[47:09] hallelujah he never intended to use the
[47:13] truth
[47:14] to bind anybody
[47:16] but he did intend to use the truth to
[47:19] set you free
[47:20] amen not to bind you but set you free
[47:24] amen now the devil wants to take the
[47:26] truth and alter it and make it be
[47:28] bondage make it be fear make it be
[47:30] complex and make it be everything god
[47:33] didn't intend for it to be
[47:35] but god wants to take the truth and he
[47:37] wants to set his children free
[47:40] by that truth god don't want to use his
[47:43] truth and beat you over the head with it
[47:46] he don't want to use his truth to make
[47:48] you live in fear brother he wants to use
[47:50] his truth to free the church of the
[47:54] living god
[47:56] there is freedom in the word there is
[47:58] liberty in the word
[48:00] in the truth of god his liberty and
[48:03] freedom
[48:05] for all
[48:07] glory to god
[48:09] in the truth
[48:11] not a lie
[48:12] amen let's ask the question who is the
[48:14] truth
[48:15] what is the truth who has the truth
[48:19] god does
[48:21] hallelujah amen god has the truth i love
[48:24] the way the bible reads in numbers 23 19
[48:27] amen god is not a man that he should lie
[48:30] neither the son of man that he should
[48:31] repent
[48:33] amen so god ain't like everybody else
[48:34] that's made a promise
[48:36] god ain't like everybody else just gave
[48:38] you his word
[48:39] god is not a man that he should lie
[48:42] or like someone that would have to
[48:44] repent in other words he's never had to
[48:47] take it back when his truth
[48:51] hey man he's never had to take it black
[48:53] when it was true but see you ever tell a
[48:55] lie
[48:56] you got to tell another lie to cover up
[48:58] that lie then another lie to cover up
[49:00] that lie but if you tell the truth the
[49:02] whole time
[49:04] amen you tell the truth the whole time
[49:07] you don't have to worry about covering
[49:09] it up
[49:10] amen i just want to say this god has
[49:12] never had to cover up any of his word
[49:14] and because he couldn't keep it
[49:16] he's never had to cover up the truth
[49:19] because he wasn't able to fulfill it but
[49:21] we know the truth of god and it is his
[49:25] word
[49:26] amen i just want to preach this for a
[49:27] moment i remember that truth as a person
[49:32] truth is a person
[49:34] you say who you talking about
[49:36] it ain't me it ain't your pastor amen it
[49:39] ain't somebody else the truth is the
[49:41] person
[49:42] who's the person
[49:44] jesus christ the word
[49:47] is the truth
[49:48] i'll tell you i got to praying on this
[49:50] brother henry i got to praying and
[49:51] thinking meditating on i thought my god
[49:54] i have actually met truth in the form of
[49:57] a person when i have had an experience
[50:00] with jesus christ
[50:02] hallelujah and i got to thinking on the
[50:04] ministry the earthly ministry of jesus
[50:07] christ when he was upon the earth amen
[50:10] and he took the scroll from the priest
[50:11] and he quoted out of isaiah's he said
[50:13] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[50:16] i'm going to bring good tidings to do so
[50:18] forth i'm going to bring liberty to them
[50:20] that are bound i meant to sell liberty
[50:22] to them that are bruised and i got to
[50:25] thinking on his message when he was on
[50:26] the earth i thought my god when truth
[50:29] was in a person
[50:31] when truth was in a body all he did was
[50:35] glory all he did was set liberty to them
[50:39] that were bound when truth was in a
[50:41] person he brought liberty he brought
[50:44] deliverance he brought healing he
[50:46] brought everything we had need of and i
[50:49] want to say this the person of the truth
[50:52] is in this pulling this morning and he
[50:55] can walk right up the aisle right to
[50:57] where you are and can do the same thing
[51:00] that he did when he was in that body
[51:03] the truth is a person and that person is
[51:07] here
[51:09] glory to god
[51:11] and you want to know how he acts
[51:13] he acts the same way that he did today
[51:16] when he was in that body come on he acts
[51:19] the same way he did when he was in that
[51:22] body he ain't here to bind your worship
[51:25] he ain't here to bind your praise
[51:27] he ain't here to bring sickness he's
[51:30] here to bring deliverance
[51:32] he's here to bring liberty
[51:34] he's here to hear your family he's here
[51:36] to help your marriage he's here to bring
[51:38] your lost loved ones back
[51:41] hallelujah he's here to
[51:44] amen he's here to lay his hands on the
[51:46] sick
[51:47] he's here to do everything that he did
[51:50] back then
[51:51] because truth never changes and the same
[51:54] thing truth did then is the same thing
[51:58] that truth does today
[52:02] hallelujah
[52:04] we're thankful for the truth
[52:07] we're thankful for the truth
[52:10] jesus christ is the truth
[52:12] hallelujah
[52:14] amen and when the truth is preached it
[52:17] does the same thing
[52:18] that it has always done
[52:21] the truth has never lost his effect
[52:24] the truth has never lost his ability
[52:27] even the truth has never lost any power
[52:30] but it is this it's the same truth that
[52:33] it has always been and in malachi 3 he
[52:36] said i am god
[52:38] and i changed not
[52:40] i'm the truth and i don't change
[52:44] hallelujah
[52:47] and the beginning was that truth the
[52:49] word
[52:50] and the truth was with god
[52:52] and the truth was god
[52:55] his word let's
[52:56] i'm not changing the scripture but his
[52:58] word is truth and in the beginning was
[53:00] truth the truth was god
[53:04] amen and that is the truth
[53:06] it's god almighty
[53:09] amen i want you to notice this god he's
[53:11] been truth all the way from before the
[53:14] foundations of the earth was ever laid
[53:17] he at any time has never lied
[53:20] at any time he's never been a deceiving
[53:22] god
[53:23] i mean at any time amen at any time he's
[53:27] never been faith amen never not been
[53:29] faithful to his own truth but he's been
[53:31] the truth the whole time
[53:34] and that truth has never changed and i
[53:36] love the scripture in john 16 13 how be
[53:38] it when he the spirit of truth has come
[53:41] he will guide you
[53:43] and all truth
[53:46] amen when the spirit of truth is come
[53:49] he will guide you back to truth
[53:52] so the spirit of truth brings you to the
[53:55] truth
[53:56] hallelujah in other words the holy ghost
[54:00] brings you to the truth
[54:02] not to a lie not to an idea but it
[54:05] brings you to the truth of the word of
[54:09] almighty god
[54:11] hallelujah now i want you to notice
[54:13] during the beginning with adam and eve
[54:14] god gave them the truth in the beginning
[54:16] did he not
[54:18] him and god spoke to him in genesis 2
[54:20] and 16 and said the lord god commanded
[54:22] the man saying of every tree of the
[54:25] garden i must freely eat but of the tree
[54:28] of knowledge of good and evil thou shall
[54:30] not eat of it for in that day that thou
[54:33] eat us thou shalt surely die
[54:35] now god gave his children in the
[54:37] beginning
[54:38] the truth of his word amen you can eat
[54:41] of any tree in this garden but the tree
[54:43] in the midst of the garden don't eat it
[54:46] for when you do eat it you shall surely
[54:48] die amen now they didn't have a whole
[54:50] lot of commandments to live by they
[54:52] didn't have a whole lot of word to live
[54:54] by but god gave them truth to live by
[54:57] now i want you to notice i mean i
[54:59] noticed the estate that they lived in
[55:02] amen when god gave them that word they
[55:05] were not in bondage
[55:08] hallelujah
[55:09] they were not in bondage but they could
[55:12] come to god in the cool of the evening
[55:14] they could fellowship they could talk to
[55:17] him he would talk back they could
[55:19] commune with god almighty they had such
[55:22] a amount such a pure and holy fellowship
[55:25] amen a communion between god and man
[55:29] and they had the truth
[55:31] but see the truth did not bring the
[55:33] bondage
[55:34] amen the truth did not amen the truth
[55:37] did not run them out of the garden of
[55:38] eden
[55:39] the truth brought them into fellowship
[55:41] the truth brought them into communion
[55:44] but see notice the
[55:46] devil he wants to pervert the truth
[55:50] amen he wants to change the truth
[55:52] is that right
[55:54] he wants to change it just a little bit
[55:56] now don't change all of it but just a
[55:58] little bit amen he wants to change it
[56:01] just a little bit
[56:02] i remember by doing so he kills all of
[56:05] it
[56:06] by changing one word
[56:08] and i want to say this if you want to
[56:10] change one word from this bible you're
[56:12] going to kill all of it you're going to
[56:14] lose all of the life that's in it you
[56:16] change just the least of it you're going
[56:18] to kill all of it
[56:21] amen that's what satan wanted to do he
[56:23] wanted to change anybody you you realize
[56:26] that the devil hates you having liberty
[56:28] the devil hates you having freedom and
[56:31] when the devil hates you being a free
[56:34] son of god
[56:35] he hates you coming to church lifting up
[56:38] your hands getting in spirit worshiping
[56:41] in spirit worshiping and truth and when
[56:43] the devil hates that more than anything
[56:46] when you enter into worship in spirit
[56:49] because then it's such a it's such a
[56:52] true pure worship when you go beyond the
[56:54] fleshly worship and you go into worship
[56:57] and spirit
[56:58] and so what he wants to do is bind all
[57:01] of that he wants to hinder all of that
[57:03] amen he saw adam and eve he thought my
[57:05] god i cannot stand the way that they
[57:08] fellowship with him they talk to him he
[57:11] talks to them they have such a they have
[57:13] such a community i can't stand to do it
[57:18] that was his motive see the devil wants
[57:20] worship
[57:21] he wants he he wants all that he wants
[57:23] to be god he hated seeing the fellowship
[57:26] so he thought what i'll do is i'll come
[57:28] to eve and say eve exactly what did god
[57:31] tell you well here's what he said we can
[57:32] eat any tree that's in the garden but
[57:35] the one in the midst of the garden we
[57:36] can't eat it or will die and then what
[57:38] did he do he changed one word
[57:40] not
[57:41] thou shall not surely die
[57:44] i mean he thought well i guess this is a
[57:46] pretty good idea i'll go ahead along
[57:47] with it
[57:49] but she didn't take it back to the word
[57:51] come on she and take it back to the word
[57:55] be very careful
[57:56] when you don't take it back to the word
[57:59] death is knocking at your door
[58:01] take it back to the word
[58:03] line it up with the word
[58:06] and then you keep the life but when you
[58:08] alter the word death enters in
[58:11] and that's what happened to them hey man
[58:13] she said well i think that's a pretty
[58:15] good teaching there i shall not surely
[58:17] die why it's a fruit to be desire to
[58:19] make one wise i'll just go and take a
[58:20] bite notice this even when she did what
[58:24] god told her not to
[58:27] when she broke the truth when she broke
[58:30] the word that god had given them
[58:32] amen now comes all of these emotions
[58:35] guilt
[58:36] shame depression
[58:39] amen all of these all of these different
[58:41] spirits amen the spirit of depression
[58:43] says wait a minute now i've got an
[58:45] attack on him hey man he flies up from
[58:48] hell and he attacks himself to eve's
[58:50] spirit
[58:52] is that right
[58:53] amen guilt and shame they say wait a
[58:55] minute here's an open door and it's
[58:56] humanity they fly up they go to even
[58:59] adam and they attach on to their spirits
[59:02] and then now they're forced out of the

[59:14] away
[59:16] they're walking around having to carry
[59:18] these things and having to deal with

[1:00:16] was the man named truth
[1:00:18] hallelujah the person named truth which
[1:00:22] was god was their only way out
[1:00:26] they had to carry all this baggage
[1:00:29] but church

[1:00:32] in this generation
[1:00:34] he has made himself known to the church
[1:00:37] of the living god
[1:00:39] hallelujah he has made himself known
[1:00:42] unto the bride of jesus christ by
[1:00:45] revealing himself

[1:00:52] ever known it
[1:00:55] hallelujah
[1:00:58] glory to god
[1:01:00] after disobeying the truth
[1:01:03] and shot them straight in the bondage
[1:01:05] and they became servants to sin
[1:01:08] amen they no longer could worship could
[1:01:10] fellowship could have communion
[1:01:13] because after leaving the truth was
[1:01:15] bondage
[1:01:16] amen after disobeying the truth was
[1:01:18] bondage
[1:01:20] hallelujah
[1:01:23] amen as i said there in the scripture in
[1:01:24] john 8 34 jesus answered them saying
[1:01:26] verily verily i say unto you

[1:01:31] is the servant of sin
[1:01:33] so you seek the truth was there freedom

[1:01:59] contend for the faith he said you see
[1:02:01] it's the truth that makes you free
[1:02:03] jesus said he that heareth my word
[1:02:06] and believeth on him that sent me so he
[1:02:09] actually ties those scriptures together
[1:02:11] and says it's the truth that shall make
[1:02:13] you free and then he quotes there amen
[1:02:16] in the book of john 5 24 but he that
[1:02:19] heareth my word

[1:04:26] beautifully there with the old testament
[1:04:29] i'm sure you're taught very well here
[1:04:30] but you notice there in the old
[1:04:32] testament that jubilee trumpet that
[1:04:34] would sound
[1:04:35] i mean now there was many people that
[1:04:37] could hear that trumpet
[1:04:39] mean many people could hear that trump
[1:04:41] but

[1:04:44] know what it meant
[1:04:46] amen you could not respond to jubilee is
[1:04:49] that correct if you did not know what
[1:04:51] the jubilee trumpet
[1:04:53] then you would not know that it was
[1:04:56] declaration that you could go free

[1:05:01] anybody that was a slave to amen that
[1:05:03] was a slave to their taskmaster they was
[1:05:06] a slave to any amen any particular
[1:05:09] movement there was a slave underneath
[1:05:10] that amen there would be an opportunity
[1:05:13] under the law that every 50 years
[1:05:16] jubilee trumpet could sound
[1:05:18] and if you heard the trumpet
[1:05:21] oh god if you heard the trumpet it was
[1:05:24] an opportunity

[1:05:43] when the trumpet sounded it meant you
[1:05:46] could go free
[1:05:50] and the prophet taught me that when you
[1:05:53] hear the sounding of the truth of the
[1:05:56] gospel when you hear that certain
[1:05:58] trumpet sound it is a sound that you can
[1:06:02] lift your hands and you can drop those

[1:10:21] powerful illustration in that even in
[1:10:23] the bible she's known as ray had the
[1:10:25] harlot

[1:10:28] that she had received them spies with
[1:10:30] peace
[1:10:31] amen she had received i mean received
[1:10:34] that message with peace and said this i

[1:13:15] hallelujah it was at the sounding of
[1:13:18] that seventh trumpet
[1:13:20] she begins hearing the creak and
[1:13:22] and the crackling and the crumbling and

[1:18:12] thought why in the world
[1:18:14] why are they acting that way
[1:18:16] he said open up my bible and i looked in
[1:18:19] the truth
[1:18:20] and i noticed that the victory brought
[1:18:23] on some dancing
[1:18:26] that dancing is associated with the
[1:18:28] victory he said so i didn't take the
[1:18:30] dance out of the church i didn't take
[1:18:33] the shot out of the church i just said

[1:19:04] i said glory to god
[1:19:06] we're free this morning
[1:19:12] ain't that what they would do
[1:19:14] they climb on top of that hill
[1:19:16] a strong man would do it and that right
[1:19:19] a strong man would climb on top of that
[1:19:21] hill and would stand up there because
[1:19:24] some people that was down in the valley
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:28] i'm gonna preach on this for a minute
[1:19:30] some people were down in the valley and
[1:19:32] they they weren't quite getting the
[1:19:34] message brother they weren't quite
[1:19:36] really entering in what was going on
[1:19:38] oh god
[1:19:40] some people were so low in that valley
[1:19:43] it wasn't really registering with him
[1:19:46] they said what in the world is all that
[1:19:47] shouting on the mountain what in the
[1:19:49] world's all that victory up there what's
[1:19:51] all that freedom about and so a strong
[1:19:53] man
[1:19:54] he would get on top of the mountain
[1:19:57] he would scream out the trumpet's been
[1:19:59] blown the trump has been
[1:20:02] blown and it goes to show it no matter
[1:20:06] how low you are in the valley it don't
[1:20:09] matter true it don't matter if you're
[1:20:11] underneath the valley if you hear the
[1:20:13] slightest blow of that trumpet brother i
[1:20:16] will stop what you're doing and say god
[1:20:18] this is my moment this is my service
[1:20:21] this is my opportunity amen this is my
[1:20:24] hour to receive my deliverance
[1:20:30] glory to god
[1:20:33] hallelujah
[1:20:36] god don't make slaves
[1:20:39] he frees them
[1:20:42] hallelujah
[1:20:43] i said god don't make slaves he frees
[1:20:46] them amen direct quote god does not make
[1:20:48] slaves he frees them
[1:20:50] amen so whenever you find yourself
[1:20:52] getting bound in your worship getting
[1:20:55] bound in your praise i want you to
[1:20:57] remember these words god ain't doing
[1:20:59] that to you
[1:21:00] i said god ain't doing that to you
[1:21:02] even when he tries to come and quieten
[1:21:04] things down well y'all just don't don't
[1:21:07] don't don't do what you're doing there i
[1:21:09] mean
[1:21:10] there's something i've studied our
[1:21:12] adversary you ever studied him i mean
[1:21:13] i've studied my adversary and i realized
[1:21:16] what he wants to do i've seen him in
[1:21:18] church services before i mean some
[1:21:20] people get free in their emotion
[1:21:23] they may cry a little bit they may lift
[1:21:25] their hands they they'll get free in
[1:21:26] their emotion but you see they're not
[1:21:29] really having a breakthrough in their
[1:21:30] spirits they're not really having a true
[1:21:33] breakthrough amen and you'll watch that
[1:21:35] stay on them i i'm gonna expose it here
[1:21:37] for a minute because it's the devil that
[1:21:39] does that it is not god that does that
[1:21:42] we're clear it's the devil that does
[1:21:44] that amen somebody will get free in
[1:21:46] their emotion they'll have a little bit
[1:21:48] of emotional worship but jesus came to
[1:21:51] that woman at the well and said what the
[1:21:54] hour is coming when they that worship me
[1:21:57] will worship me in spirit and in truth
[1:22:02] hallelujah
[1:22:03] so god is desiring
[1:22:05] more than just a fleshly worship but he
[1:22:08] wants it in spirit
[1:22:10] and in truth
[1:22:12] and the devil wants to get in the spirit
[1:22:15] i am going to hang on to you and tack
[1:22:17] himself to you and say remember
[1:22:19] yesterday remember two weeks ago
[1:22:22] remember this remember that
[1:22:24] and he'll keep your hands down
[1:22:26] if you let him
[1:22:29] i said if you let him he'll keep your
[1:22:32] hands down
[1:22:33] but i tell you i heard a story one time

[1:28:23] agree with you on this you hate that
[1:28:25] nicholas spirits

[1:28:57] word that we have zero strings attached
[1:29:00] to it
[1:29:01] but that we can come to the house of god
[1:29:04] we can preach the truth of this word
[1:29:06] we can worship in spirit we can worship
[1:29:09] in truth but we don't have to answer to
[1:29:11] nobody but to god almighty even though
[1:29:15] we respect our pastors and our leaders
