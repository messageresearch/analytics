heads let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you for coming down in our midst tonight Lord we ask that you'd move in such a mighty in a special way Lord touch each and every heart touch each and every need Lord move and say something to your people that would be a blessing Lord Lord help them in such a mighty in a special way and Lord may you get all the glory the honor and the praise cause Lord we thank you we thank you for allowing us to come into your house one more time Lord we thank you for keeping us safe and Lord keeping us on our jobs keeping us in our homes Lord Jesus Lord we ask that your presence will come down in our midst tonight and move in such a mighty in a special way in Jesus name we pray amen amen tonight if you got your Bibles we'll turn to turn a real real simple thing tonight turn to the Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 6. a very familiar scripture I'm sorry everyone knows it Matthew chapter 6 and we'll start in verse 5. said when our prayers thou shall not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of man verily I say unto thee they have their reward but thou will now pray as enter into thy closet and want and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which see it in secret shall reward open reward the openly but when you pray use not vain repetitions as the heathens do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knows what things ye have need of before ye ask him after this man are therefore pray Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen you may be seated tonight I'd like to speak on a little small topic and not entitled a prayer or also the power of Prayer and I read the scripture because it's it's when Jesus he came to Earth and he said he gave us instructions for how to pray he came down and he he said when you pray you should pray like this and it's pivotal to me that that's our communication with the father and that's the way that we communicate with God is to get down on our knees and to pray to him and when we pray to him things happen things can move God can do things but you got to talk to him you got to have that conversation to him and it's so important that we pray that it's so important that we remember those times on our knees where we got a hold of God and God moved and I missed God moved in our situation and as the songwriter said even when we don't see him working he's working even when we pray those prayers and we think they've forgotten God has a way of answering them when we need them he has a way of coming down and vindicating and surely I still heard those prayers I still heard what you got down on your knees it might have been years ago but I still heard what you asked me for and I'm gonna do exactly what you asked me to but it might not have been when you thought it was going to happen but it was right on time it was right on time it was right when God wanted you to have it he said I'm going to give it to you but he heard those prayers it's a Matthew 21-22 and he said in all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believe in you shall receive it see sometimes when you go down in prayer you got to believe what you're asking for you got to believe that lord lord I want you to do this and I believe that you are more than able to do it you're more than able to do what I'm asking you for whatever it is Lord I believe that it shall be done in Jesus name and you got to leave it at that you said it whatever ye shall ask in prayer believe in you shall receive it and Philippians it said four and six it said be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God said there's some Thanksgiving sometimes you got to go and before you ask you got to thank them you need to thank God and say Lord I Thank you for everything that you've done thus far and I know that I'm coming with a request but Lord I got so much more and thank you for there's so much more Lord I got to get down and say thank you you because even though it might look rough it might look tough but Lord there's still so much I can thank you for you've been that good to me you've been that even more good to me and David said if I had ten thousand Tums I couldn't praise you enough see there's some Thanksgiving that has to happen before you ask God for things because God just wants you to praise him he wouldn't have created you if he didn't want you to praise him he wouldn't have created everything that he created this world and let the devil fall from Heaven so that he could have someone to praise him he said before with with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God in James 5 15 he said and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and it if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him see you have to pray with faith you have to pray and it said and it says in the Scripture it says in the prayer of faith shall save the sick he said when you have faith with prayer it shall save the sick so if you're sick and you have and you pray with faith it said it shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up it's not anyone that any man can do it's not anything that any doctor can do anyone that anyone can say do except but the Lord shall raise him up and we have to go with faith and Lord You're Going To Raise Me Up Lord you're going to deliver my body Lord you're going to deliver me out of everything that I'm going through every demon that's coming against me Lord you're going to do it and he said if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven him and it says I think in the word it says that he'll throw him into the you're forgiveness and remember them no more and said that and I wrote out I said I thought about something I was faced with some situations recently and it made me examine my prayer life and I said Lord I went to pray for something then I got convicted and the Lord came to me and said you got to be right before you pray you go down on your knees sometimes you wonder why God ain't moved but have you gotten down and you said Lord forgive me for anything I said I done or even thought that was against you Lord forgive me and now I can pray now I can give you Thanksgiving because Lord I want to be right before you that you can hear my prayers Lord I want to be right before you that Lord I know that you're hearing what I say even though I mean I see that like you're moving but I know that you're moving because that's what you said you would do and Proverbs 15 29 he said the Lord is far from the wicked but he hears the prayers of the righteous the Lord May if you're doing things that are not right then it may not seem like God is moving in your life even when you're praying it may not see but you know I something a song that somebody prayed for me sometimes you don't know what God has protected you from because somebody was praying for you you don't know what God has kept you from because somebody was praying for you somebody was on their knees the Lord sent them and woke them up in the middle of the night and said pray for them pray for this one pray for that one because they need prayer they can't even intercede for themselves but Lord I'm going to intercede for them that Lord you bring them out Lord that you deliver them Lord that you take care of them Lord that you keep them from all harm keep them from those evil spirits that's coming against them Lord keep them from anything that may not be not like you it said in Proverbs 15 8 the the sacrifice of the wicked isn't an Abomination to the Lord but the prayers of the upright is his Delight the prayers of the upright is his Delight said that you got to be right with God when you go to pray when you expect God to move you want to be right with them you want to make sure that all channels are clear and said many times some people don't get it right to the end of the road but you got an opportunity each and every day to get it right you got an opportunity to every day that you have breath in your body say Lord I want to live closer and closer to you Lord I want to live closer and closer for you Lord I want to grow in in you and Lord I want you to do exceedingly and abundantly in my life in James 5 and 16 it said confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed some people wonder why they aren't healed and they haven't confessed what they have in them you can't move past that until you that's a scripture that's not anything that we said but that's in the scripture in James 5 and 16 it says confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the affection fervent prayer of the righteous man Avail as much she is you have to confess things sometimes you got to come and you if you got all against your brother your sister you got to come and confess to him and say brother forgive me sister forgive me Pastor forgive me anyone that you that you may feel that that you may feel against you have to come and confess it and get it right and then pray and then pray that you may be healed said in Ephesians said praying always with all prayer and supplication and spirit watching therefore unto all perseverance and supplication for All Saints in first Thessalonians 5 17 and said pray without ceasing so so God wanted to put that in the scripture if it wasn't important he wouldn't have put it there it was only three three words pray without ceasing it was but it was pivotal because with everything in life you need to have constant communication with God everything that you do you should be asking Lord should I do this Lord should I go here Lord should I conversate with these people Lord Lord God my tongue God my speech Lord Lord that I might not say something that's against you Lord that I may that I might be a light for you because whether you like it or not people are watching people are watching what you say people are watching how you react and sometimes the devil will send a test so that he so that you can react and to be to be so that your testimony may not be as impactful as it is because people are watching you they may not be watching a person that says something to you but they watching How You Gonna react and sometimes you got to pray and say Lord Keep Me Lord keep me from what's coming against me because I can't keep myself Lord watch over me and let no put a hedge around me that's what the devil said Lord I can't touch job because you gotta hedge around them but lift that hedge but God knew what was in job God knew that you know what no matter what I give Joe as long as you don't take his life he's not going to deny me not once he's not going to come against me once he's always going to stick with me because God knew what was in job just imagine how strong job had to be with his prayers when everyone comes against him even his own wife came against him the only one that he could talk to was God the only one that he could go to and confide in was God his body's feeling him his friends have failed him his wife has failed him his children have been killed they're gone all his wealth is gone who else does he have to turn to but God then I I wonder if job was praying all the time I guess he had to he didn't have no one else to turn to he didn't have no one else but God knew that when he didn't have no one else he still would turn to him he wouldn't forget what God had already done to him and if God could do that he could do more than he ever could expect and I I wrote down something I said sometimes you gotta ask for what you want you got to go to God and you gotta come with the right Spirit when you go to God you got to come with the right attitude when you go to God but once you come with the right attitude and the right Spirit then you can ask for things in Mark 7 and 7 he said ask and it shall be given seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open unto you so all you have to do is ask sometimes I think in James it says you have not because you ask not and when you ask you ask a Miss that's what James said you have not because you asked not and you ask sometimes like why don't I have this why don't I have that it's maybe because you ain't asked for it maybe because you you you got to there and the Lord was waiting on you to ask for more and you said I'm satisfied with what I have I'm satisfied with what I have Lord but but David said Lord I want my cup to run over Lord I wanted to overflow I wanted to overflow I don't want to just be filled I wanted to be spilling over sometimes you know I I've seen this in my own life sometimes you look around you say Lord why is everyone else being blessed around me and sometimes you look and you say you know what maybe the Lord is Blessing them because of me being in this place because I pray every day Lord bless them and bless this bless where I am bless my child bless and bless my co-workers Lord and I'm and they're receiving some of the blessings that God is pouring on your life and you wonder why man I can't understand this but God is doing the work it's not what you do it's not anything that you do you said Lord I Surrender everything the Lord I just want to be a willing vessel Lord I want you to fill me up and continue to fill me up Lord that I make my cup May overflow now others may feel your presence now Others May know that you are God that you are the one and the true God and there's nothing that I may say or do but they know that you are real to sometimes people when you when you start getting getting into that prayer people will come to you and ask you to pray because they know that God is moving on your prayers they'll come to you you made the stranger the person that don't like you or say they'll go through something and they'll come and they say hey can you pray for my family can you pray for this situation and you said they don't even like me they might have spoke things against me but they'll come to you because they know that when you pray things happen things change and that's the that's the god that we serve that he can change it in John 14 and 14 say if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it it's just that simple sometimes when you go to God and pray you got to believe that God is able and willing to answer what you ask him for you got to believe that God will do everything that he can what that he said he would do if it's not contrary to his word then you got to believe that God can do it you got to believe the Lord when I get down on my knees said that when the weakest Christian get down on they need is to pray all the devil's Shake because they know there's power in that prayer they know there's there's power in the prayers when they when you get down to pray and I was reading something and it touched me and said now there are some things in the Bible this Prophet God said he said there's some things in the Bible that God wants us wants us to challenge and God is an all-powerful God and he gives his servants a commission to do great things and we mustn't be afraid to ask God to do great things so we mustn't be afraid to ask God to do great things because he's asked us to do the impossible without him so if he's asked us to do the impossible we want to have the I'm nipping um omnipotent God to do those Impossibles he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow them that believe the impossible with man that's impossible with man and we mustn't be afraid to ask God to keep his word said we mustn't be afraid to ask God to keep his word so if God said it in his word then it shall be done he said no word can return to me boy so if you ask him and it's in his word then they can't turn return to him or so you believe that it's going to happen you believe that no matter how long it takes it's going to happen if you believe and God said I shall deliver that you believe that it's going to happen and it shall happen because that's in his word if you believe if you say that Lord you said you would heal then you got to believe that it's going to happen because it's in his words he said by his strength we are healed yes anything that's in his word you mustn't be afraid to ask God to keep his word because it's his word it's his word and he gave it and he said it can't return to me boy said when you get down to pray you said you want to defeat the Devil you use the word you don't use anything else you turned here and you said Lord in his word that's how Jesus defeated them and that's how we're supposed to defeat him I can't be afraid to ask God to keep his word I can't be afraid to ask God to do what he already said he would do he said he would bless me I can't be afraid of the blessings of God and I can't be afraid of the healing I can't be afraid of the Deliverance of God because he's God there's no one greater than him he said I own the cattle on a thousand hills and he can give it to you he's a God that can change things he's the god that can deliver he's a God that can set free he's a god that is above all names he's Jesus and there's no one that's higher than him said you can't you mustn't be afraid to ask God to keep his word see that's what prayer can do prayer it can move mountains it can cast things into the sea he said what you bound on Earth our bind in heaven and what you're loose on Earth are loose in heaven so you need some things bound up you get down on your knees and you say Lord I need you to bind this up Lord I need you to move in this Lord I need you to take control because Lord that's what I need you to do Lord I'm coming to you and Lord this is in your word Lord you move you do what you said you would do it's in your word and it can't return it to your voice yes when you go to him with the right Spirit God can do exceedingly and abundantly more than you can ever ask for a thing because that's the god that we serve amen [Applause] it's all right to praise God Amen it's all right to tell the Lord thank you Hallelujah it's all right to ask God to keep his word this ain't something somebody else promised us but God in heaven he heard Hallelujah and he made the promise didn't he it's all right to ask God to keep his word he said if you believe on the Lord hallelujah then thou in thy house ain't that what he said come on well it's all right they ask God to keep his word hallelujah oh yes oh Jesus Hallelujah sometimes ain't nothing else to say hallelujah we're gonna ask God to keep his word for your unsaved children we're gonna ask God to keep his word Hallelujah for your loved ones we're gonna

darkness of hours I ain't afraid to ask you to keep your word Hallelujah you know God brings us to certain trials and tribulations situations he never left us he was all he's still there the whole time he let everybody fail you so our brother was preaching tonight I was just meditating I said sometimes you you come to a place especially early in the Christian journey and you feel like you're all alone and nobody's there I said but in that time that's when I found God in that quiet place when I had nobody else to talk to I found God in that place you know how because I was on my knees talking to God all about it calling on the name of Jesus that's where that relationship was built and that's the way God in those times those in those prayer Clauses those coming out to the church sometimes all night being by yourself but in those times that's when that relationship was formed that's when that Bond was formed and he let he let you know early in your Christian Journey that I'll never leave you nor forsake you he let you know early then you can trust in me when everybody else is gone I'll still be here it was in those times that you forged that relationship but it wasn't in the mass crowds it was somewhere in the steel steel place down on your knees in prayer I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna sit down because I believe God he don't say what he wanted to say tonight but I was thinking I was telling my wife and I know somebody else I was saying you know in certain situations only prayer gonna help we don't talk we don't try it ain't doing no good it ain't did no good that's all we're going to do is pray because in certain situations only prayer will do amen [Applause] praise God God bless you let us just stand we appreciate the Lord and they got pan here tonight
