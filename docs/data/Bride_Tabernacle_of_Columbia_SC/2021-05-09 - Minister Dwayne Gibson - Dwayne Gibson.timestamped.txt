[40:15] he hideth and for joy they of goeth and
[40:18] sell it all that he has
[40:20] and by that field so he found something
[40:22] that was precious
[40:24] more prayer than what he possessed and
[40:25] he went and sold everything he had
[40:27] and brought that field again the kingdom
[40:31] of heaven is locked unto a merchant man
[40:33] seeking goodly pearls
[40:35] who when he had found one pearl of great
[40:38] price
[40:38] went and saw all that he had and brought
[40:41] a hickory another
[40:42] somebody he's seeking for pearls
[40:46] he found one of great price he would
[40:48] have sold everything he had
[40:50] to get that one amen let us pray
[40:54] gracious kind heavenly father we have
[40:55] read your word now lord we ask you to
[40:57] bless it lord let it find its place in
[41:00] the hearts of your children
[41:01] we thank you for this day may you bless
[41:03] us in jesus christ's name
[41:05] amen may be seated amen we're going to
[41:09] talk about
[41:09] selling out for jesus
[41:12] selling out for jesus christ
[41:16] here god said the kingdom of heaven is
[41:20] likened to
[41:21] treasure god has to be
[41:24] treasured to you if god is not like
[41:28] treasure to you then you won't seek him
[41:31] or you won't give up things that you
[41:33] think is treasure
[41:35] for him god has to become treasure to
[41:38] you the kingdom of god
[41:40] must become more precious than anything
[41:43] you own or possess
[41:45] and you must be willing to sacrifice or
[41:49] to sell or
[41:50] give up off a sick everything you got in
[41:52] order to get into the kingdom of heaven
[41:55] that why we're here this morning because
[41:57] we want to get into what
[41:58] the kingdom of heaven we want to be
[42:02] where god is we want to be in that new
[42:04] heaven and that new earth that new
[42:05] jerusalem that's we want to be so god's
[42:08] kingdom
[42:08] is like somebody's seeking something
[42:11] seeking
[42:12] treasure seeking something better than
[42:14] what they already possess
[42:17] you're seeking something better than
[42:19] what you already possess
[42:21] in this life this life right here we
[42:22] might possess things but are not more
[42:24] precious than the kingdom of heaven
[42:27] the things that we possess now don't
[42:29] compare with the kingdom of heaven y'all
[42:31] hear that
[42:32] it don't compare so we seek him with
[42:34] something better than what we already
[42:35] possess
[42:36] and when we find that something we are
[42:38] willing to sacrifice or give up or sell
[42:40] everything we got in order to get there
[42:43] now if you got that kind of attitude i
[42:45] believe you'll find god
[42:47] you're willing to give up sell out
[42:49] everything that you possess
[42:51] now i think you got a hold of you
[42:53] willing to give it up in order to get to
[42:55] the kingdom of god
[42:57] a lot of people sad to say i'm not
[42:58] reached that point

[44:39] in a in a life a man of perth and just

[44:44] god because they have given up
[44:46] everything that they thought was
[44:48] precious in their life into that
[44:50] to the time when jesus came into their
[44:52] life amen somebody been

[45:03] came
[45:04] amen and they and jesus they were
[45:06] willing to give all that up
[45:08] in order to get christ so they sold out
[45:12] their dreams
[45:13] sold out their desires sold out what
[45:15] they wanted to be
[45:16] in order to grab a hold of jesus christ
[45:18] i wonder if somebody this morning wants
[45:20] to do that
[45:21] want to sell out your dreams set out
[45:23] your desires
[45:24] in order to grab ahold of jesus christ
[45:28] i never live in a world now where people
[45:30] think having a bunch of materialistic
[45:32] things
[45:33] is being a christian because they've got
[45:36] all the materialistic things in the
[45:37] world they think they're christian
[45:39] my materialistic things don't make you a
[45:41] christian
[45:43] having the best house or the best call
[45:45] or whatever that don't make you a
[45:46] christian
[45:47] what makes you a christian is that you
[45:49] soul out to jesus christ
[45:50] and you're walking in god's word and
[45:52] doing the will of god did y'all hear
[45:54] that
[45:55] see that what makes you a christian
[45:57] thank god for the blessing
[46:00] amen i don't serve him for the blessing
[46:02] he promised to bless me
[46:04] if i put him first see that's how
[46:07] blessings come
[46:08] it didn't come because i ran after him
[46:10] or you ran after him it came because you
[46:13] served the lord
[46:14] and gave yourself over to god and
[46:16] because you did that god began to bless
[46:18] you
[46:20] he began to multiply you begin to do
[46:24] things for you amen all because
[46:26] you sold out you sold out
[46:31] thank god those you ever sold out that
[46:33] you sold out
[46:35] you sold out to jesus not to a church
[46:38] not to a building but your soul out to
[46:41] who jesus christ
[46:43] you got to recognize who jesus christ is
[46:45] he is what the word of god
[46:48] manifest for our day
[46:51] not another day for this day so you sold
[46:53] out to the word of god
[46:55] you've got to be sellout in this
[46:56] generation you got to be sell out in
[46:58] this age
[46:59] everything is contrary to god and submit
[47:02] yourself to god to jesus christ who is
[47:04] the word that's right
[47:06] the word for our day manifest for this
[47:09] deal right here
[47:10] so these examples here people are
[47:12] seeking
[47:13] god they're seeking something better
[47:15] jesus said the kingdom of god is
[47:17] likened under treasure and when you
[47:20] really found jesus
[47:21] he is treasured to you you don't want to
[47:24] let him go here man
[47:26] oh he's like tragic to me i will not let
[47:28] him go i don't
[47:29] found a pearl of great price and it
[47:31] means more to me than anything
[47:33] i won't let it go see when you find
[47:35] jesus christ like the bible said
[47:37] then it become like a pearl a great
[47:39] prize or a great tragedy that you've
[47:41] been seeking you found this treasure
[47:43] and you will never let it go
[47:46] no matter what the world brings no
[47:48] matter what the world said no wonder
[47:49] what satan tried to offer you you then
[47:51] found this pearl of great price
[47:53] and you won't let it go hallelujah the
[47:56] world will try to steal it from you
[47:58] though
[47:59] the world is trying to steal and then
[48:00] you're the devil come to kill steal and
[48:02] destroy
[48:02] so the devil will try to steal it from
[48:05] you don't you let them steal it from you
[48:07] but you know i'm still how important
[48:09] jesus christ is to you
[48:12] he's important to you look look at your
[48:15] life before christ came into it and look
[48:17] at your life now would you rather do
[48:19] better hold on to god won't you rather
[48:22] sell out everything you've got in order
[48:23] to hold on to god
[48:26] you will hold on to him cause you
[48:27] realize how precious he is
[48:30] to who to you now he's not precious to
[48:33] everybody
[48:34] everybody don't value him like he should
[48:37] be valued
[48:38] i might heard that see
[48:41] some people place a value on jesus and
[48:44] the value that some people place on him
[48:47] is not a high value judas iscariot
[48:51] plays a value of what 30 pieces of
[48:53] silver
[48:56] he sold the lord out see you can sell
[48:58] out for jesus
[49:00] or you can sell jesus out judah sold him
[49:03] out
[49:04] for 30 pieces of silver that's all he
[49:06] valued him
[49:08] oh lord this morning is he worth more
[49:10] than that to you thirty pieces of silver
[49:14] judah sold him out he thought back then
[49:16] that was a lot of money
[49:17] i think some people figured it out and
[49:19] it comes into the millions of dollars
[49:21] but jesus christ is worth more than a
[49:23] million dollars
[49:25] how much do you value him to smile you
[49:27] willing to sell him out for 30 pieces of
[49:29] silver
[49:30] are you wanting to sell him out for that
[49:31] big time job that you got
[49:34] he's worth more that big-time job worth
[49:36] more than jesus no
[49:38] nothing is worth more than him so some
[49:40] people sell them out
[49:41] for a little bit of money they sell the
[49:45] very most important one out they can
[49:47] ever meet
[49:48] the most important one you can ever come

[49:52] them out for a little bit of muscle
[49:53] meat don't you sell them out this

[50:04] blocking you from getting to god come on
[50:05] somebody

[52:24] them and that's the fault that could
[52:25] have went
[52:27] we got a guard to go higher than that

[52:42] didn't god do what the apostles me
[52:43] agreed in the bible they were in
[52:44] ignorant i learned men
[52:46] didn't know the abc but when they met
[52:48] christ there's a difference coming
[52:50] inside their life see
[52:51] so you don't have to be a scholar to
[52:53] know christ you can be just as simple as
[52:54] simple can be
[52:55] but god comes over hallelujah he come
[52:57] down with simplicity

[53:32] that children can understand they can
[53:34] understand that something more precious

[55:57] chapter amen praise god
[55:59] amen romans seven amen
[56:04] amen romans 7 and 14.
[56:08] amen now notice the bible takes us back
[56:11] here to the beginning
[56:12] it says we know where we are the lord's
[56:14] spiritual about him carnal
[56:16] soul under sin adam sold us out
[56:20] adam sold us out eve caused the problem
[56:23] but adam sold us out
[56:25] did y'all hear that his soul is out to
[56:28] what to sin
[56:30] the bible said a man was not in the
[56:32] transgression but the woman was in the
[56:34] transgression eve
[56:35] listened to the devil that's right she
[56:37] taught paul took out a fruit boy
[56:39] adam did adam came and sold us out by he
[56:42] partaken of the fruit so he sold us
[56:44] out adam could have stealed another side
[56:48] of the line
[56:50] but there's another type inside there
[56:51] that god was working that
[56:53] christ had to die to redeem his bride
[56:55] that's right
[56:56] the adam was filling two sides there but
[56:58] he sold us out to sin
[57:00] that's why we're in the shape we're in
[57:01] today because adam sold us
[57:03] out it's all about the sin
[57:07] but thanks be to god we got another adam
[57:09] that came and sold himself out amen
[57:12] he saw himself out to get us out of sin
[57:15] we can read that to you by the grace of
[57:16] god amen jesus christ
[57:19] sold himself out give him everything
[57:22] to come down do what redeem me and you
[57:26] he gave up his throne in glory come on
[57:28] somebody sold out
[57:29] everything he had he was the god of
[57:31] heaven but he came down the earth
[57:34] amen inside the form of a man amen the
[57:37] god into a form of a man
[57:38] came to redeem man but he had to give up
[57:40] everything first
[57:42] he had to sold it out he had to leave it
[57:43] behind and come down here for me and you
[57:46] thank god he did it amen so jesus adam
[57:49] sold
[57:49] us out put us all in the shape that the
[57:53] world is in today
[57:54] all because he took side with his wife
[57:58] but only then that's a type how jesus
[58:00] christ
[58:01] whose love for his bride came and give
[58:03] his life for the world that's right
[58:05] so adam sold us out to what sin
[58:09] sold us out look everything adam's
[58:12] sacrifice
[58:15] in the god in the garden of eden the
[58:16] beautiful garden that god created adam
[58:18] could have still been here today
[58:20] if he won the soldiers out he had the
[58:22] spoken word which was the original seed
[58:24] he could have that that power that god
[58:26] gave him to
[58:27] rule over the earth when he sold us out
[58:30] he gave up all that look
[58:31] look what he lost by selling us out
[58:35] look what you will lose if you sell
[58:37] jesus out
[58:38] you sell jesus out all the blessing that
[58:40] god has given you usually what you're
[58:42] going to lose them
[58:44] you don't want to lose your blessings do
[58:45] you all the things that god has given
[58:48] you and done for you through the years
[58:50] and you decide one one moment i'm going
[58:52] to just give it all i'ma sell it out
[58:54] to go do what i want to do don't you
[58:56] lose your hallelujah i don't want to
[58:57] lose the blessing that the lord has
[58:59] given me
[58:59] i want to hold on everything that god
[59:01] has blessed me with i want to lose
[59:03] nothing
[59:05] i'm going to hold on to it see adam lost
[59:07] everything y'all know how to have it in
[59:09] the garden of eden adam was blessed in
[59:11] the garden
[59:12] had everything the trees will be in the
[59:14] animals have been the window beam
[59:16] everything was under his control and
[59:18] dominion
[59:19] but when he sold us out he lost it all
[59:24] that way you can't sell jesus out
[59:25] because you'll lose everything
[59:29] amen praise god judah sold them out
[59:32] for 30 pieces of silver he thought he
[59:35] was gaining something
[59:37] but he lost everything the bible said he
[59:39] went and hung
[59:40] himself but it was too late to end see
[59:43] once you sell jesus
[59:44] out it's too late
[59:47] you knock them might gonna be able to
[59:49] get back let's read that let's go to
[59:51] matthew 27 chapter amen judah sold them
[59:55] out for
[59:56] 30 pieces of silver they sold joel's
[59:58] about for 20.
[1:00:00] they didn't realize that he was going to
[1:00:01] need joseph
[1:00:03] you see they didn't realize that he was
[1:00:06] going to need joseph
[1:00:08] but to that point right there joe didn't
[1:00:09] mean nothing to them number the dreamer
[1:00:13] that daddy loved more than them but they
[1:00:16] can't recognize that god was working
[1:00:18] through that young man see that they
[1:00:19] missed
[1:00:20] they missed the blessings of god because
[1:00:22] of jealousy
[1:00:23] how many people were jealous of somebody
[1:00:24] today because what god is doing for them
[1:00:28] how many were jealous of somebody that
[1:00:30] god is blessing and
[1:00:32] and they're jealous of me and want to
[1:00:34] separate themselves from or put them out
[1:00:36] the midst of whatever they did joseph

[1:08:37] take up your cross and follow me you
[1:08:40] can't do that
[1:08:41] see he can do everything else keep the
[1:08:44] commandment for that day see he was
[1:08:45] doing that what
[1:08:46] he was doing what he knew for that day
[1:08:49] but when jesus came it was a new day
[1:08:52] come on somebody
[1:08:53] it was a new day now you gotta do more
[1:08:55] than just keep the law now you've got to
[1:08:57] follow jesus christ
[1:09:00] you got to follow jesus christ now that
[1:09:02] what you was telling him you oh you
[1:09:03] didn't do again but one thing you're
[1:09:04] lacking
[1:09:05] you were doing good for your day you had
[1:09:07] moses damn you kept more than what moses
[1:09:09] said but now you're in a new day
[1:09:11] you're in a new era you're in a new time
[1:09:13] now you got to follow me
[1:09:16] you got to follow me now and if all of
[1:09:19] me you got to tell all you got
[1:09:21] take up your cross and follow me the
[1:09:24] bible said he went away
[1:09:25] sad that was a hard saying many young
[1:09:28] people today can't
[1:09:29] give up everything to follow jesus many
[1:09:32] old people can't give everything to
[1:09:34] follow jesus
[1:09:35] they can come to church and all that but
[1:09:38] when it comes down to selling out and
[1:09:40] giving over
[1:09:41] everything that would he lack
[1:09:44] you like that one thing sell all you got
[1:09:48] sell your desires
[1:09:51] sell your ambition sell it all off for
[1:09:55] who for jesus christ
[1:09:57] and give yourself over to the lord that
[1:09:59] young rich ruler the bible said went
[1:10:01] away sag
[1:10:02] the bible he had great possession only
[1:10:04] if you had that revelation
[1:10:05] that if you have sell all those things
[1:10:07] for god god would have given many times
[1:10:09] more than that back
[1:10:11] did the paul just say lord what shall we
[1:10:12] have sinned we have followed thee
[1:10:14] we left houses and mothers and fathers
[1:10:16] and land for thy sake jesus knows no man
[1:10:18] that left
[1:10:18] anything would not receive a hundred
[1:10:20] full mole
[1:10:22] in this life and in what the world will
[1:10:24] come
[1:10:26] so if you sell out for jesus don't worry
[1:10:28] about it he's gonna bless you with a
[1:10:29] hundred times more than what you give up
[1:10:32] that way you shouldn't be worrying about
[1:10:33] giving them nothing for jesus did you
[1:10:35] give it up for jesus he gonna bless you
[1:10:37] with more
[1:10:38] how many of y'all didn't experience that
[1:10:40] you didn't give up for jesus and god
[1:10:41] didn't bless you with more
[1:10:43] you gotta have more than ever had in all
[1:10:44] your life why could you give it up you
[1:10:46] sold it out for jesus
[1:10:47] and god doesn't bless you with mo all of
[1:10:49] jesus that caught that revelation
[1:10:52] he had caught it he would have not
[1:10:54] walked away
[1:10:55] and turned away eternal life but because
[1:10:58] then
[1:10:58] he lacked that revelation that god will
[1:11:00] bless you whatever you give up for god
[1:11:02] god gonna bless you
[1:11:04] but he didn't he didn't catch the
[1:11:06] revelation of it and therefore you went
[1:11:08] away
[1:11:08] sad went away
[1:11:11] sad all because
[1:11:14] he didn't realize that you give about
[1:11:16] anything for god

[1:11:19] more
[1:11:21] he's gonna bless you you sacrifice for
[1:11:23] him he's gonna bless you

[1:25:00] hebrews 11 and 26
[1:25:04] amen praise god
[1:25:09] amen esteeming the reproach that
[1:25:11] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[1:25:14] with the people of god and to enjoy the
[1:25:17] pledges of sin for a season moses by
[1:25:19] faith he refused to be called the son of
[1:25:22] pharaoh's daughter
[1:25:24] see that was a lie
[1:25:27] they kept him in power pharaoh's wife
[1:25:30] found them you know they tried to first
[1:25:32] of all they tried to kill him that's
[1:25:33] right
[1:25:34] the whole scheme was to cast them into
[1:25:35] the knob for the crocodile to eat them
[1:25:38] but god got hold of moses mama and daddy
[1:25:40] and it had some faith
[1:25:42] bob's because they saw he was a proper
[1:25:44] child and they placed him inside a bull
[1:25:46] or a basket and put him into the nile
[1:25:51] and thanks be to god god let him all the
[1:25:53] way down
[1:25:54] to the king house ain't got good
[1:25:58] you ought to let no crocodiles eat him
[1:26:00] gonna let nothing happen to the basket
[1:26:02] god let him scream on down to pharaoh's
[1:26:04] house
[1:26:06] straight down to the affairs i fear had
[1:26:08] a barren daughter
[1:26:10] couldn't have no children she found this
[1:26:12] her nurse and somebody found this little
[1:26:14] um thing in the in in in the now and she
[1:26:17] takes this child and makes it her child
[1:26:19] she said this is my son i call his name
[1:26:22] moses
[1:26:23] but that wasn't her child more than kind
[1:26:26] of bothering he was
[1:26:27] come to years he refused to be called
[1:26:31] the son of pharaoh's daughter
[1:26:32] see what he did he denounced all that
[1:26:35] riches
[1:26:36] he's done all that fame he's not all of
[1:26:38] that
[1:26:39] in order to get god see when he come to
[1:26:42] years he was being taught by the mother
[1:26:44] anyway
[1:26:45] her mother would let them know who he
[1:26:46] was your mother let you know who you are
[1:26:48] if you only listen
[1:26:50] y'all hear that children your mother let
[1:26:53] you know exactly who you are if you just
[1:26:55] listen
[1:26:56] she'd be trying to tell you every day
[1:26:59] who you are moses mama taught him who he
[1:27:04] was
[1:27:05] what his purpose was amen what god had
[1:27:08] him there for and he would come to years
[1:27:11] he refused to be called the son of
[1:27:12] pharaoh's daughter
[1:27:14] he threw it away choosing rather to
[1:27:17] suffer affliction with the people of god
[1:27:19] than to enjoy the pledges of sin for how
[1:27:22] long
[1:27:23] a season might know
[1:27:26] some seasons are long some seasons are
[1:27:28] short but he refused it
[1:27:31] see he could have been then joined all
[1:27:33] the pledges of
[1:27:34] egypt but he turned it down he sold it
[1:27:36] all out
[1:27:37] for christ amen by faith he forsook
[1:27:41] egypt not fearing the wrath of the king
[1:27:44] for he endured
[1:27:46] as seeing him who is invisible now he
[1:27:48] watched the ten commandments
[1:27:50] didn't make you think more than was
[1:27:51] afraid but the bible said he wasn't
[1:27:53] afraid
[1:27:55] bibles he feared not he forsaken not
[1:27:57] fearing the wrath of the king we endured
[1:27:59] seeing him who was invisible that's god
[1:28:01] that's right
[1:28:03] he wanted to see god he wanted to see
[1:28:06] god
[1:28:07] see that some got inside moses he comes
