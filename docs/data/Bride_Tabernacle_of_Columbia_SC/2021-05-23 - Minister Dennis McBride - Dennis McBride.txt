we all feel that it's good to be here by the grace of god i mean the lord allow us to see another day amen and it's a reason for us being here amen we um our hearts and our prayers go out to our precious brother uh i know here within the last few years you all have experienced you know some loss it's not just you but you know all over you know though it's just the timing of god is ticking around you know when i was much younger you know i didn't experience many deaths that were right around me like within my own family and things of that nature you know especially when you're young you just kind of your mind is it's like people are going to live on forever you don't think about death but then as time went on you know my uncles and my aunts and you know my grandmother and everybody just started fading off the scene you know when i realized the older i get the more of that i see it's just it's just the timing of life you know you know the way that god has his appointment said amen it's just the timing that just takes place but uh that was a a wonderful homegoing service on yesterday and i thought it was real timely and a blessing just how brother simmons was expressing in the beginning you know how he had desired for the family to be able to hear her last testimony and a word in a song and they wasn't able to get it quiet together and what have you and his you know to to to him not knowing as soon as he finished ministering they were able to put it on and i felt like that was just a right placing for that you know seeds were being planted how many believe that amen and we don't know you know god is the gardener isn't that right he's the one that tends after his seeds so wherever he plants it a man he takes care of the ground and he he makes sure that it brings forth he brings forth the increase so we just keep everyone that was here in prayer uh and and just believing that that god is going to have his way and and you never know what's going to come out of that amen but god knows you know we thank god for brother simmons i know he's not here um with everything that's been going on uh you know uh fellowship hadn't been able to take place as often i believe is in our hearts we would desire for it to be but i know here a few weeks ago i think he and brother ernest was riding together and they stopped by my house when i wasn't there and they told my son to ask me to get in contact with him and so i just went ahead and stopped by his house i hadn't been over there in so long and then we stay right around the corner for one another but i i just be gone work church family and then traveling as much as i've been traveling lately so it was good to be able just to sit and fellowship with him for a while amen and uh and so we're here now by the grace of god and i just believe god has times and seasons for everything you understand what i'm saying you know whenever god brings ministries through i i don't want it i don't i don't want to believe it's just by the ordaining of man and the appointments of man i believe is it's god that knows when to bring what's needed in the right seasons and so i don't know how long it's been since i've been in i just know that god got seasons so we just pray his will be done this morning it's good to see everyone that's here uh some new faces you know a lot of familiar faces uh seeing the young people growing on up man i see it in my own family you know my son dennis he'll be 24 this year benjamin benjamin will be 19. no benjamin to be 20. and then david would be 18 jonah i'll be 16 and anna be 14. i got grown people it seemed like just yesterday they were so small and you want to rewind time when you see that it's like man there's so much more i wanted to do you know but the lord knows amen let us bow heavenly father it's good to be here not just to be in another building amongst people father but it's good to be someplace lord where it feels but we can feel your presence for one and where it feels to me in my heart like it's your will because without your will father and our lives being accomplished every day what good is our lives there are many people that's just going about just doing whatever and there's no real purpose behind it it's nothing that's really being achieved according to what you would desire but yet everybody has their course but lord we're here this morning we believe by your grace and we pray father that now we hear that you would please come father and help us in your word we believe you've already visited us lord you're here i can feel you in the atmosphere father god i believe we all can just sense your presence but lord we just invite you lord to be able to speak freely and to move freely throughout the continuation of the service lord we are your people lord god and this is your time you know what's best for us father we don't so we come as children looking to the father for whatever you would have for us lord and you pray that you we pray that you would help us in our hearts to be receptive father help me lord god to be guided to speak as an oracle unto you lord god they didn't come to hear a man's opinion of anything but they came to hear from their father their husband their god lord please bless us with that father this morning lord our hearts go out as we said lord to our brother to the family lord god that's experienced the recent loss that they have but we're grateful father for her testimony for the life that she lived lord god and as it says in your word lord is is precious to you lord god the taking home of your saints [Music] she's your daughter father god she's joined with you lord and she's in a better place than us right now god to hear her testimony lord god she was looking for healing father she's received her ultimate healing lord [Music] father she wouldn't come back here if she had to our prophet lord god his wife was brought back temporarily lord and she questioned why it was that she was asked to come back she was in a better place father god [Music] so lord we thank you for the memories father god that's been left behind lord and we pray strength be granted and comfort right now father be be given in a time of lost lord god but we know lord throughout time you are strengthened and you are healed and you are mend [Music] those things that are needed in every heart father that's experienced the loss memories will be there lord but we believe you'll bring a comfort so now lord that we've approached this part of your service we just pray that you would help us help your people father god have your way we ask in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen amen you know our bible saying let's turn to uh we thank god for the musicians it did a great job and even in yesterday how the lord used them to be able to to just use their gifts to give glory to him and and the comfort to the family you know at that time it was real real good i used to play the violin you wouldn't never guess that i played for a few years and i don't remember nothing about it now i was in middle school and i enjoyed it then but i got away from it and i just forgot everything so the lord knows amen all right let's go to the book of james saints chapter 3. thank god for brother ernest and his wife he mentioned to me that they having their anniversary amen may the lord continue to bless them in every family and every couple james chapter 3 starting at verse 1. it says my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we offend all and i don't want to read over this too quickly saints let's just really think about what's being said here because god is communicating something very important he says for many things we offend all if any man offend not in word notice he says the same is a perfect man so of any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body so now he's taking the bridling of the tongue meaning your speech being controlled right and he's linking it to something he's showing he's kind of pointing us to something a little deeper so even though he's talking about the broader length of the tongue there's something else that's deeper that he's really pointing to because now he's saying if that tongue can be bridled that same person he said is a perfect man and is able to bridle the whole body meaning all of his actions and his thoughts are controlled he says behold also the ships i'm sorry verse three behold we put bits in the horse's mouth he says that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body that's true right it's big and you know some some horses weigh tons and a little bit in that horse's mouth and you can turn this whole body amen he says that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small hand wither so ever the governor the governor listed he says even so the tongue is a little member and boasts of great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth notice how he says this saints and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity he says so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of hell so he's saying that the tongue he says can be set on fire of hell what does that mean saints meaning the inspiration and the anointing of demon powers can control a person to a place to where they can use that person's tongue to speak the desire of satan that's heavy amen matthew 12. matthew 12 starting at verse 30. it says he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad wherefor i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men he says whosoever notice how he says this now and it's tied again to the mouth death and life is in the power of the tongue he says verse 32 and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither the world to come either make the tree and the fruit and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit o generation of vipers how can ye notice how he says this now how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance where of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things he says but i say unto you that every idle word every word no matter where it's spoken or who is spoken to he says every idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned so it's a lot of weight that god is placing upon what we say let's pray lord jesus please have your way lord we love you you love your people you love us all share with us your desire in jesus christ's name we ask it amen god bless you saints sorry to have you standing so long i haven't been able to get away from this for quite some time now and even though i've been led to minister this in different different locations and things of that nature even though i was coming when i was asked to come here which was on yesterday i didn't just want to speak on this because it's something that i've been speaking on we don't want to just speak things out of convenience we want to be able to speak according to god's will and so i was after i was asked i just kind of began to become prayerful and i asked god to help me because there's many different things that could have been spoken on and as i was just praying and yesterday i found myself fasting and uh now just praying and just kind of going about my day and he brought something back i started listening to a particular sermon not knowing what was going to be the contents of it and he brought something back and as soon as it hit a certain part this just kind of it just came to the forefront of my heart and just stayed there and over the years i've just kind of learned i don't know at all i'm still learning i'm still a child you know but i've learned to just kind of sense when the lord is leading in a certain direction don't don't always get it right but it's just i don't know it's becoming more familiar to me now so then this particular subject i felt like was his will for me to share with the church uh it's not a rebuke so you know i pray that the enemy don't bring that across to anybody's mind like that but i believe it's something that god is sharing with with us to help us to come up higher uh because he's a father and as a father you you know i'm a father i got five children and i've i'm still learning my children helped me to learn so much they've helped me to grow so much over time you know god has used my family and uh but but you you have to deal with things at times that are needful but not pleasurable meaning it's not pleasing to the ear it's not anything to make you laugh like that you know what i mean but yet it's needful for the soul is needful for the building of the right things so that we can have a more victorious walk you know in this life so as a subject this morning i want to share uh just as the lord would help me a portion of what i have on my heart concerning a perfect man a perfect man as we've read saints it matters to god how we speak not just how we speak to saints in the church but how we speak to anybody and i say that and i want to point you back to himself in the scripture look at how he conducted himself the bible says the common people heard him gladly the bible says republicans and sinners they felt comfortable enough around him to want to join themselves with him wherever he was just to sit down even though they were in the condition that they were in they man they didn't feel intimidated by christ but i believe in my heart by the scriptures what they felt saints was a love and because he was who he was he knew all things right amen so so he understood every one of their conditions even when they were wrongly accusing him i pray the lord help me not to keep you long this morning but lord just guide my words because this is very important even even when they were wrongly accusing him right and had a wrong mind toward him wrong attitudes toward him look at how he handled them on the cross right on the cross they were crying out for his blood they placed him up there isn't that right they placed him up there he didn't deserve to be there we know he was fulfilling scripture it was for our good but he didn't deserve to be there and and they were shouting around him crucify him put him through great torture and pain and he had done no wrong the question was that for what what did he do what did he do to deserve this he didn't do anything but even in that state when they were wrong and he was completely right and innocent saints look at what came out of his mouth looking upon the crowd beating up hurting pain in his body looking upon those that did him that way and out of his mouth from his heart because he was god he said father forgive them for they know not what they do so the bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever so when he's in us he's no less than what he expressed when he was walking on the earth in that body he's the same person and that person is trying to bring us somewhere he's trying to bring us to a maturity sense a spiritual maturity but we can rise above what i would call human foolishness gossiping backbiting amen carnal divisions amongst people amongst churches now we understand the people of god the children of god the true children of god you're called to a higher place because of who you are everybody's not called to that place so it doesn't matter how many people around you are acting in whatever kind of a way god is his god's eyes on you he's expecting he's expecting something more from us he won't allow us to act like everybody else can we say praise the lord this ain't an easy way when it comes to human ability isn't that right because the because based upon how you're treated like right now in this room right here there are wounds spiritual and spiritual i was about to say mental but it's connected it's the spirit of your mind because your spirit controls your thoughts isn't that right there are spiritual wounds that people have hurts things that have taken place over time that's been caused by the devil and in our weakness listen and in our immaturity we we we adopt certain ways of thinking and viewing people we come to church and we hear all about the devil but can't recognize the devil when he's in our own minds causing us to look at people in a wrong way listen now causing us to put our mouths on people in a wrong way and somehow we think we special at times and we think that because it's us and our thoughts and our words that god somehow is condoning us and saying that's right son of child you writing your thoughts you know son james and john came listen it wasn't even near battle but jesus was going to jerusalem but he was going to stop by samaria and the samaritans wouldn't wouldn't receive him because it looked like he was going to jerusalem and they had a little division amongst them right and james and john they saw that listen this is real important his sins that was their friend christ was their friend you know how people get you know how friends get if one friend don't like somebody all of a sudden well i don't like them either that's okay it ain't okay never but amongst the world that's common but in church we got to be able to stand with christ it don't matter who it is in my own family if daddy is wrong children wife you follow christ isn't that right so it ain't no no of you against that oh you know i'm against them too uh you know because i know you got something against him now i got a little funny feeling i don't want him to do with him either now that's foolishness man god ain't pleased with that how are we gonna listen all of us have our weaknesses we have our times of failure huh how does he handle us huh we working against him hurting him in his heart does he put us away from him how welcoming is he amen listen now at the end his face we sin against him how welcome is he to us see the natural man can't handle these kind of things it takes the spirit of god upon a heart and a mind to bring a man subject to his spirit and to his will listen now that's why there is no real victory outside of the baptism of the holy ghost god is the one that gives us what we need to be able amen to conduct ourselves listen to bride of the whole body without him saying that we can't control our tongue because whenever you're hurt listen like i said there's wounds in here right even though i'm preaching this sometimes some people still have a hard time letting stuff go so and so did you just don't know brother so and so did me like that you will see him again and the devil now the devil will work through your memory your emotions huh those inlets to the spirit your consciousness the devil will work through those things as soon as you see a person he'll be right there to try to reactivate those thoughts and those connected feelings that keep us bound because whenever we're like that now the holy spirit can't truly come and rest upon us we got to be like lambs he said we are counted as sheep for the slaughter slaughter of what slaughter of ourselves a killing of ourselves i'm talking about a perfect man now see because where do your words come from your words come from thoughts isn't that right how many can say amen today your words come from thoughts it's not just your mouth your mouth just don't run by itself nobody's mouth just runs by itself it's the communication and if you listen real carefully if we're in the right place because jesus when james and john called out like that that was their friend and they felt like they were standing up for their friend but even though jesus was their friend and their husband and their lord he wasn't with them in their era so when he saw they got off track with his mind and his way he looked at them knowing they were trying to stand for what's right but he had to call it out he said you don't know what spirit you are where i'm at right now i didn't come to destroy men's lives but to save it they're acting like that now but they're still amongst that group because the woman at the well listen the woman at the well and then when she went back and testified the people of the city came of samaria you understand what i'm saying so saints this thing is set in such a way the only real safe plot for us to be the only real safe frame of mind for us to have is that of a child you can't trust how you see things because you can look at something and see absolutely wrong no matter how many experiences you've had with god amen god got to continue to lead us i'm no authority on nothing lord i need you for everything if i see a situation i can't come to a conclusion lord i don't know what to think he asks ezekiel son of man can these dry bones live ezekiel saw all them bones [Music] and he did the safest thing that he could i ordered he said lord thou knowest because to him and his mind i know humanly speaking from a natural mind it didn't look possible but ezekiel knew that god was far above man's ability he said thou knowest lord and that's how i feel i see things i see mistreatments listen the lord has allowed me to go through many things people look at you from the outside and think they you know it's like they're too quick to to assume things we're going to get into something here in a moment matthew 5 he says in verse 43 ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy he says but i say unto you love your enemies think about that somebody you actually consider to be an enemy is somebody that you feel like obviously has done you great harm or is against you in an extreme way maybe you don't know why do we realize things that god will allow those kinds of things to or rather do you realize that god has allowed those things to be placed in your course in your course of life he's allowed situations and people to come into your life to cross your path listen and to you in your mind you're probably like man i wish i would have never met this person but in god's mind he's saying that's the right kind of a person you needed in your life because there is something imma work with you on the focus ain't them yeah they acting like they acting and whatever but i i allowed that to happen because it's something i want to deal with you on sometimes we don't see things in the right way verse 44 but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you that's not what's in our minds is it somebody cursing you and speaking bad about you and you hearing about it from other people huh that's not the normal reaction of a man or a woman amen the mindset is what hurt feelings now that's where the enemy slips in right there why they talking about me like that and guess what what happened saints if you're not careful that anointing comes upon you and you know what you do you begin to go back and talk about them bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you it's very contrary to the way the world operates but it's well within how god operates see the world ain't going in a rapture who's going in the rapture raise your hand if you believe you're gonna go in the rapture huh those that are going in a rapture guess what the requirement is saints to be just like him the bible says it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he appears we shall be just like him in every way not just in the laying on of hands to heal the sick and things of that nature that's all well and fine but people anointed by wrong spirits can do that isn't that right amen but satan can't be the holy ghost huh he can try to put on an image he can try to act throw a facade out there but you listen real carefully and you watch the actions it'll begin to show itself it will begin to bleed through the smoke screen he says and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may notice how he says this now that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven why because that's how he was the bible says the rich young ruler even though he was turning them down the bible says jesus looked at him and loved him isn't that right those that were crucifying him again he says father forgive them for they know not what they do and then when the same spirit came upon a man listen there wasn't a virgin born but that was sin born stephen with that same spirit on the inside of him it caused him to look upon his killers and that same one that spoke on the cross that same one was inside of stephen now and even though his life was being taken he was able to beat listen he wasn't just saying that because he was well you know people people are going to come behind and read about what happened to me so let me just say the right thing so that they'll be able to have something positive to hang on to no sir by nature it was a part of who he was and in that kind of a moment saints out of that man's lips he asked for forgiveness of those that were killing him with the last few breaths he had in his body just think about what are some of your thoughts and your feelings about those in your life that the lord is allowed to cross your path what are your thoughts and your feelings toward those individuals and just understand that it must be brought into a place to where it matches the word your words come from thoughts and your thoughts come from your heart and whatever inspiration is upon a person that's what determines how they'll think and how they'll speak that's why the bible says that a tongue if a person is not careful it'll be set on fire of hell who wants that to be their case i'ma touch upon a few things here saints everybody all right praise the lord notice here in james chapter 1 and verse 26 it says if any man among you seem seem to be religious you know we come to church or whatever you know uh we learn we learn through the word of god how god is and what god's expectations all right and it's only right that we try to live better than before right and that's what our journey has been it's not that every time you went to try to do what was right it was easy for you you know for whatever growth we've seen over time up to this point it's been purely by the grace of god it's not been it's not been due to how hard we've tried but at the same time when we hear the word of god when we for true bride members now when you hear that word of god and it touches upon your life and you feel that prick there's something in you that wants to what wants to give god his desire you don't want to be displeasing to him isn't that right that's why we come to church right because we want to be better and god is here to make us better but it's a struggle at times it's a struggle it's many struggles that we must go through we struggle within ourselves with ourselves so in that in that time and that process saints we try to act right we try to do what's right amen which is good we ain't gonna say nothing against that but there is something that's very real that once it comes in you're able to rest you cease from your own works you understand stephen was resting he wasn't trying to work up anything it just flowed from that brother's heart it flowed from his heart into his mind and out of his mouth it wasn't fake or put on it was the genuine moving of the holy ghost and i know that's our desire we know that god has given us many victory saints but this right here at the end of the service i'm gonna share something with you we're right there we're right at a major junction right now listen i don't care how you feel i don't care how you see yourself i don't care what you got going on in your life right now that does not change or or stop or alter in any way the movement of god and the timing of his plan the rapture is gonna listen the rap god knows what day what hour what year what have you the rapture is gonna happen right now isn't that right we don't know it but he knows it but guess what whenever that time comes everyone that's supposed to be in that rapture no matter what condition they're in they're going to be ready it's going to be by the power of god that's why our faith has to rise to such a place in god to where we can believe him for anything we don't care about the symptoms that's why listen you you i understand we all got problems we all got things going on even in me preaching what i'm preaching right now even if it's touching upon your life okay that's good okay repent put forth the best step you put forward and say go tomorrow take the bet you know put forth a good effort to make another step that's a better step than what you did yesterday right try your best but that faith lord i believe i see my inadequacies i see my failures i see my weak areas lord you know all about me but lord i believe and i trust in you to make me into what you desire for me to be he's the potter listen he can do it in a second do you believe that in your sight you might say man i got so much good brother i hear you preaching right now bro that a lot of that apply to me god can change it before the service ends where's your faith it's that simple now don't don't don't don't don't don't let it go over your heads that faith is already with us amen all we have to do is release it to god and in that atmosphere of faith he'll drop down saints and he'll do he'll he's god it it goes so far beyond us see for sister beverly it was her time to go that's why even though the prayers were offered up and then even she was believing it was it was just her time you understand that but until we knew it was her time we believed god for the miraculous and even though the lord allowed her to pass guess what we don't care if somebody else rise up with the same situation we're going to believe god that's how god designed for it to be that's what he's looking for in his church saints to believe him regardless i got needs right now i got serious situations surrounding me but by the grace of god i'm in a better place we're human and the enemy knows how to try to pluck out our streams because we're still in a fallen body man in a human spirit you know our spirit you know even though it's anointed by the holy spirit yet is able also to be receptive to evil spirits you can have the baptism of the holy ghost in the soul and still entertain wrong spirits but because god is where he is remember a big ship is turned about by a very small hymn brother branham as he spoke about the holy ghost coming into his life he said it was about the size of a fingernail that light coming down into that soul amen and moving a whole man about controlling his thoughts controlling his words bringing him subject that's what the holy ghost is doing inside of us right now saying he's giving us victory over ourselves can we say praise the lord to that he's leading us into battle within ourselves he ain't needing you to be in a battle with somebody else's life god's causing you to focus in on you he's building us up as individuals getting us individually ready for a rapture and he's there i believe he's there praise the lord notice how he says this though if any man among you seem to be religious he says or not bridleth not his tongue it says but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain isn't that something got all the right acts come to church worship all that stuff pay tithes seem to be faithful but quick to say any and everything that come to his mind or her mind you know how people sometimes say i got to just tell it like it is brother that's just how i am well make sure how you are is the way he wants you to be cause in his word said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it spoke about him loving his enemies those that persecuted him and came against him how did he conduct himself from his heart because he's a god of love he's not willing to and it should perish but it all should come to repentance amen saints i don't want to vain religion though i give my body to be burned very helpful everywhere to do all kind of things for anybody and you have not charity all your works all of your good deeds the bible says means zero to god i'm talking about a real place this is what all this was about this is this is why the this is what god sent elijah this is why god opened the seven seal saints it all draws down to what i'm talking about right now god having full control inside of a people that's ordained to unfold his person in these last days and i believe we are that people and what is god doing says he's operating on us we're on the surgery table right now and the holy ghost with his word he's cutting down to those needful areas to do what saints to heal us amen to uproot the devil amen to cut out bitterness and malice and strife took a reader to create an atmosphere saints that he can really step down in hey man the bible says god want to walk in us we ain't got to toot no horn all we got to do is humble ourselves and just go about everyday life and let you just ministering for popularity ministering for money ministering for the building of any kind of a reputation any minister with any any one of those things that's predominant in his mind and heart you need to do all of us a help and sit down because he ain't useful he's wasting time that word preeminent it means having rank listen having rank dignity or importance that's supreme to all others the bible says saints that god is called for us to love him with all of our mind all of our heart and all of our strength but the brandon said god wants to have the preeminence he want he wants to be the supreme thing in each one of our lives that carries the most importance to us because when he's in that rightful place in our lives that'll control and dictate how everything else flows from our life and it doesn't matter how pleasing we can be to another person it's how pleasing we can be to him and when we're pleasing to him everything else will fall in his rightful place all right i'm gonna try to i'm gonna try to wrap this up because i'm just feeling i'm feeling like you know it's it's just i need to kind of draw it down ecclesiastes chapter five starting in verse one because notice this now our prophet told us that our thoughts are heard louder in heaven than our words are upon the earth right so it's not just the speaking that's one it it goes all the way down to the soul because when your soul is right then and god listen and when we we begin to die and to yield to god more and more when our soul is right amen our spirit will be right because he came he he also is is helping us in our spirit isn't that right he's telling us from the control tower what things are wrong and how he wants things done when our soul is right then our thoughts will become right when our thoughts are right then our words have become right so the whole focus is the soul even if we've had experiences with god's sayings how many realize we need more we need we we we need to we we need a refreshing so much is going on say we need a refreshing i need a refreshing i need a fresh refilling of the holy ghost amen stephen the bible said was full of the holy ghost it don't really don't matter if the whole church is there whatever let us individually be there it ain't about my family i love my family right but what the lord has been helping me to see look you come into your place you yield to me more you die you you you give me my desire and let's listen now he'll display himself in such a way that it'll bring forth such a witness you talking about a revival it's more than just words speaking intellect we can learn a whole lot and speak a whole lot but people want to see something they want to see a living god they just want to hear the words of a living god they want to be able to see him amen [Applause] ecclesiastes 5 starting at verse 1 saints it says keep thy foot when thou goes to the house of god and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools he says for they consider not that they do evil verse 2 says be not rash with thy mouth that means don't be quick amen be not rash with thy mouth he says and let not thine heart listen now the prophet said our thoughts are heard louder in heaven and our words are upon the earth he says and let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before god when jesus went to the house of simon the bible says simon stouk's word if he knew what manner of woman that was who touched him if he was a prophet he would know that he didn't open his mouth but yet he opened his heart and even though his lips didn't move god heard every word and jesus turned and addressed him based off of his thoughts sometimes we come to church and we get real good at not saying something but you're thinking a whole lot he says how can you being evil speak good things all kind of activity in the inside but yet oh praise the lord hey how you doing brother branham said in his own church people walking by telling them he loved him and everything and he said you know you don't but guess what that didn't stop him from loving them and desiring to see them changed isn't that right so god don't want something else to be in our hearts and we saying something else with our mouth he wanted to match he want the heart to match the mind and the mind to match the words of the mouth he wanted all to come on to come from him amen so he's telling us how we should be careful now let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before god for god is in heaven and thou upon the earth therefore let thy words be few for a dream coming through the multitude of business and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words many times when i'm around people i don't know or whatever that well i just listen i ain't got to say a whole lot even if i'm around ministers a lot of times i'm just quiet because i just listen you just hear just kind of hear what's going on sometimes if you talk too much you miss things anyway you know how sometimes you you you can talk to somebody they just talking talking talking talking talking talking and you try to say a little something but they got the next thing they want to say in mind so then when you say what you say it's almost like they ain't even hear you so usually having a conversation by yourself uh amen but listen the bible tells us amen just just to listen watch this now come into a close saints i think that was in james also if i'm not mistaken anyway you know the scripture the bible says let us be quick to hear slow to speak and slow the wrath what is god doing just don't be so quick to say whatever's on your mind just don't be so quick to receive every thought that comes to your mind the bible says we we we need to take into captivity what every thought to the obedience of christ anything that tries to exalt itself above the knowledge of god the word of god listen how you gonna do that you gotta consider your thoughts just because your thoughts come to your mind that don't make it right but that's how we feel many times brother i'm thinking it so it must be right we don't even question where it's coming from there's a way that seemeth right unto a man it seems but the bible also our hearts is very wicked and deceiving oh we all over the place saints lord have mercy where are we at here in psalms 19 verse 12 it says who can understand his errors if i ask the question who in here knows themselves we all like right now we ain't gonna raise our hands but many times we feel like we know ourselves you know if anybody know me as me right how many realize the bible lets us know different you can think you know yourself but not even know yourself says in psalms 19 12 who can know who can understand his errors this is david now david understood oh i don't know me there's things inside of me i'm not even aware of but when i find myself in certain situations and places i see things come out to my surprise who can understand his errors cleanse down me he says from secret faults keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let not let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression notice how he says this saints he says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight not in my sight because i don't understand my own errors but in thy sight isn't that where the focus lies not how i look at somebody else's sight the lord in thy sight let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable there's a place saints that god want to bring us up to i'ma share this one portion of this quotation with you brother branham was forewarned by god to be careful what he said he said satan has a trap set for you that trap involved other people a couple that god was uh was allowing to be anointed by demons they were already given to that lifestyle obviously but god let them feel the liberty to be able to come into that service at that time and in the service act out in a very wrong way and as i was considering this i realized you know they had deacons in that church they should have been put out right somebody should have slipped up in on that couple and say come on come on and they should have been gone but do you realize god didn't even let the deacons move you want to know why it was a predestinated trial it was something that god had established he he listened it was purpose by god for it to happen and here they come in a service and listen brother branham sitting there preaching and they're acting out and he sees he says please don't do that in church he goes as far as saying if you want to make love to the young lady go please go out and i notice how he was talking he wasn't fussing you see because the devil wanted him to get into another spirit watch this he's asking calmly he's asking calmly he said and it got to a point where something came to him and said ask what you will if you say blindness they'll be blind if you say death they'll take them out of here dead ask what you will but prior to the trial the lord told him be careful what you say now by how they were acting that was very provoking especially to a minister children wasn't there huh disrupting the service of god so now he's standing there and the lord has said what he said and it was in his mouth he had the listen god said whatever you say why are you going over this brother mcbride because i said we're out of place right now worldwide we can see the conditionings getting ripe is getting ripe isn't that right china is getting ripe the world stage is getting right the weather patterns are getting ripe the people the conditions among the people are getting right the conditions among the churches massive churches it's getting ripe in his right place everything is falling in his place right but the church is getting ripe it's a uniting time the church is becoming one with her lord there is a power a third pool which involves the that union that oneness the third pool is nothing more than the oneness between christ and his church is the person of god in full control not us speaking our mind but god having the control to bridle our tongue the bride of our whole body subject to jesus christ and now we're walking as he walked he said i do nothing except my father show me first and here it is god knowing and it's time now for this ministry to be introduced to his prophet he let that stage be said and he said it's in your hands now whatever you say and the prophet he sat there like a child he was like lord i don't know what to say what shall i say what shall i say what and that was the right frame of mind he was to be in because right when he didn't know it god came right down he said i found myself saying i forgive you of your act who was that that was god almighty god who who angels were even dirty in his sight a couple acted immorally in his service and god's mind toward that couple was i forgive you what about when people have issues in the church and people hear about it they get to talking about people oh you know so and so look at so and so and so and so and so and so where's the heart of god at just because we're in church and they're not are we seemingly not having issues but how many realize all of us got issues you might not be having the same issue with somebody else but you got issues that's equal then he said i must have said the right thing watch this now he says and it must have been just the right thing to say it was god trying a reaction to an action so you mean to tell me god will allow people to come to you and do things to you and provoke you just to try your reaction to an action but please understand this right here god was actually introducing this new ministry to his prophet this was the stage that god used to bring him higher for him to be tried in his speech to display how much he had grown in the things of god ah you can start playing brother i'm getting ready to wind this thing all the way down he says it was god trying a reaction on an action he says that night it was revealed to me that i said the right thing i know it was i know it was all leading to something but what was it what to do he says you know you have to watch that divine gift what you do with it remember what moses did so i must have said the right thing i forgive you for he says for you know john young john wanted to burn up samaria one time because they wouldn't feed them jesus said you don't know what kind of spirit you are the son of man came to save life not destroyed them scriptures just keep pouring over all night i didn't sleep he says but that was a trap set that satan would get me all worked up and then make me say the wrong thing you may have somebody that seems to be contentious in your life very argumentative you may even find yourself being like that at times if you find that you're that that you are the one that's being very argumentative and being provoking you you got to be able to be open with yourself who knows their own errors that's just how i am brother it needs to go satan trying to get us worked up to say the wrong thing to get us in the wrong spirit to cause the dove to lift up to lift off of us we need him we need to stay humble submissive isn't that right by his grace but notice this now he says don't you fear church of god i know you've got a lot of scruples among you you've got a lot of upsets and down and down sets and everything else but still you are the church of the living god do you believe that amen he said still you are the church of the living god by the grace of god you are no matter what you've done or how you've done god forgive you of your sins he wants a consecration i believe that the church of the living god is moving into a sphere i believe that no matter how you feel right now what you think of how you see things i believe this is happening right now among us this morning i believe is moving he says i believe that the church of the living god is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of jesus of nazareth to a human being talking about sister had it right ask what you will and it shall be given you anything you desire don't you see the words of jesus being fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon i'm looking forward to happen in this meeting i'm i'm wanting to see i'm wanting it to happen now he says that that anointing will strike the whole church of the living god and she'll rise to her feet like a mighty marching army the sick will be healed by a word amen i'm talking about you now the sick will be healed by a word the blind will see the death will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of god will shake the world with the church of the living god we're in the process of it now i believe it's soon coming to pass i believe it will be just exactly like that i believe i believe it's going to strike the church of god soon and it's going to start a revival that'll shake the world things are not dying down saints things are just getting started there's a squeeze that's coming huh there's a religious persecution that's coming and guess what god is getting us ready so i pray that we'll pray for one another because we all need it amen i need it we all need it god is among us saints whether you feel him or not i want to make sure that's clear whether you feel him or not he's still here and he's still moving what is he looking for what is he calling for a deeper consecration without the raising of hands how many of us know we need a better prayer life many times our failure to respond to situations right is due to us not being in that sweet place when we pray and we spend time with god like we need two saints there is an anointing that that's just upon us i know you've noticed it whenever you got those times where god has had you in that place you can come in contact with anything amen and this your mind is in a whole nother place it's in another realm you're more peaceful more relaxed more passive but when we fail to give time to those important ingredients of our daily lives that we should be incorporating amen we see something that we see a sharpness or edginess more able to just let your thoughts go you ain't you ain't thinking about taking no thought in captivity thought's just been led out of jail and running all over the place amen hey man but we're drawing down to that real place things that real union that real oneness that's where i am right now that's what i feel like god is doing i'm not where i need to be i i'll say by a long shot but i thank god for the things he allowed to be spoken in the message because brother branham said i believe under the anointing of the holy spirit that sometimes god will allow things to seem a million miles away that's a long distance isn't it he said and then in a moment bring it to pass can we say praise the lord to that have faith in god church god bless you amen [Applause] let us all stand together if we will man i've been traveling and by the grace of god just been ministering as he would have for me to minister and it's been like two times man i i don't know if i just get so wound up and caught up or whatever i know but i forget to pray and i go back in the back and i was like lord i forgot why i forgot to pray we ain't bound to a program like that but still i want to be able to pray so i'm going to pray now i'm remembering now amen let's let's about heavenly father lord we thank you for your word this morning jesus you've been so good to us you are a good father you're a wonderful father lord lord and you love all of your children as a father myself lord i see my children in their good times and in their bad times but regardless of what time they're having they're still my children and i still love them the same and my heart is to see them helped and healed and do better lord thank you for how you are lord without you being you lord we wouldn't even be here right now but lord even more importantly you told us in your word as you have loved us so shall we love one another having that same grace that same level of forgiveness being able to dismiss you said

heart lord god will allow you to come and work and produce in us lord god what your word is calling for we can't do it within ourselves father we're not able we've tried many times and we've failed

father god to look to you lord god and lord just be able to have the blessing of knowing that you're well pleased lord we want to be that perfect man father god meaning a child of god lord that has

able to persecute us lord and we'll turn around and from our hearts bless them heavenly father that's power that's real power lord that's the power of a person of god moving in a person's life displaying the goodness and the grace of god you were the fullness of the godhead bodily and lord the world didn't even know you were here so even though you were displaying the fullness of who you were it's not that it'll be so recognized but it was captured by ordained eyes and hearts it'll be the same thing today lord help us all father you know our situations that we have among us lord you see how we need healing lord you know about every single person young and old right now you know the mind battle some are having even right now in this service lord i pray you bring deliverance heavenly father lord i pray you i pray you bring victory lord i pray you bring your word back to that heart and mind father god to give them victory over the enemy lord in whatever way they stand in need of heavenly father you came to set the captives free lord and we are already free father god the devil want to make us think we're bound but we're not bound this morning we're free by the grace of god all we got to do is accept it by faith in the name of jesus christ bless your church father we love you lord help us to love you more in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen god bless you i'm not dismissing you now i'm turning it over praise the lord [Music] um praise the lord amen let thy words be few amen praise the lord victory shall be mine if i hold my peace and the lord fight the battle amen we're gonna ask brother joshua come up and dismiss us hey man y'all see me enough hey man [Music] hey man how many of you all enjoyed the service amen i tell you god knows

talk about blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god and you know you have certain people even on the job no matter where you're at they love to start different dramas
