[39:25] amen
[39:28] the book of revelation the sixth chapter
[39:30] we thank god
[39:34] we're in a critical time in a
[39:36] troubled time
[39:38] somebody called it perilous times in the
[39:41] last days dangerous times would come
[39:44] perilous times should come
[39:46] praise god we're in those perilous times
[39:50] praise god and i i thought i would
[39:53] use the thought what's next but we
[39:57] thought about it
[39:59] and we're going to use spiritual death
[40:01] this morning
[40:03] what's next spiritual death
[40:07] spiritual death
[40:09] says here it says in revelation 6
[40:13] and 7
[40:17] and when he had opened the fourth seal
[40:21] i heard a
[40:22] voice i heard the voice of
[40:27] the fourth beast saying come and see
[40:31] and i looked and beheld a pale horse
[40:35] and his name that set on
[40:38] him was death
[40:41] and hell followed with him
[40:45] and the power was given to him over
[40:48] the four parts of the earth
[40:51] the kill with sword
[40:53] and with hunger
[40:55] and with death
[40:57] and
[40:59] with the beasts of the earth
[41:02] may god bless the reasons where you may
[41:04] be seated
[41:07] spiritual death
[41:11] now
[41:13] the world attention has been
[41:17] caught by a virus
[41:20] they
[41:21] call it covet 19.
[41:26] and the virus
[41:30] that we want to identify this morning
[41:32] that spiritual death
[41:35] is covert 666
[41:42] 666 not
[41:44] covert 19.
[41:47] we're talking about spiritual death
[41:52] the virus that's attacking
[41:55] the whole world
[41:57] but being ignored
[42:00] the virus that's been overlooked
[42:04] covert 666
[42:07] we know that
[42:09] the devil will
[42:11] have everybody attention focused
[42:14] in the wrong direction where he can do
[42:18] things that are on the line
[42:21] things that are working in the unseen
[42:23] while you looking at the scene the devil
[42:26] is working on the unseen realm
[42:31] folks are amen eyes are focused
[42:34] the bible said we walk not by f
[42:37] sight
[42:39] but we walk by faith not by sight
[42:44] said the weapons of our warfare are not
[42:46] cornered
[42:48] but they are mighty to god
[42:51] to the pulling down of strongholds
[42:55] i want to talk about your unseen enemy
[43:00] that is killing more than covet
[43:03] 19
[43:05] but covet 666
[43:08] spiritual death and striking the world
[43:12] seem like the world is ignorant
[43:14] of the fact that they need to come
[43:16] together
[43:19] amen in this enemy that is destroying
[43:23] thousands and millions of souls
[43:27] that are in prison now
[43:31] yet we fail to recognize our greatest
[43:34] enemy
[43:36] spiritual death is setting in and people
[43:38] are blind to the fact
[43:41] that spiritually amen the world
[43:45] amen has gone to sleep
[43:50] they said the scientific world is saying
[43:52] that the virus is made by man
[43:59] and that
[44:01] the vaccine is killing more than
[44:05] the one that's living in
[44:07] the scientific world is baffling one way
[44:10] or another
[44:12] people don't know what to look for or
[44:14] look
[44:15] at whether they shall be revaccinated or
[44:18] whether they should
[44:20] not amen and they're hearing from the
[44:23] pulpit and from the preachers
[44:26] some are saying don't and some are
[44:29] saying do
[44:31] so people minds are being baffled they
[44:33] don't know which way to turn
[44:36] but let me
[44:39] as this pale horse rider rides in the
[44:42] last age and in the end time
[44:48] the hearts that rides
[44:52] it's pale because we had the white horse
[44:54] rider
[44:56] which is the first seal and we had the
[44:59] red horse rider
[45:03] and then we had the black horse rider
[45:06] but we noticed that the pale horse rider
[45:09] amen is a mixture of all three horse
[45:12] riders that makes the color pale
[45:16] are you up man
[45:18] so we're in that time in that season
[45:21] that
[45:22] amen spiritual depth has set in
[45:26] and in the thirty churches he said uh
[45:30] concerning the woman jezebel
[45:34] said to jezebel that i gave her space to
[45:37] repent of her fornication but she
[45:40] repented not
[45:43] oh he was cast into bed and will kill
[45:46] the children with death spiritual death
[45:48] are you with me
[45:50] because she repented not her fornication
[45:55] god gives us an opportunity to repent
[45:57] because man will not repent and
[46:00] spiritual death sets in
[46:04] god gives you and our opportunity to
[46:06] repent if we don't repent then spiritual
[46:10] death sets in
[46:12] are you with me
[46:15] so as the world is focusing on covet 19
[46:19] and the church world is focusing in and
[46:22] saying
[46:23] oh god the different things and we'll uh
[46:27] understand that folks are amen either
[46:30] way it takes faith
[46:32] to take the vaccine and take faith not
[46:34] to take it
[46:39] you can choose to try to save your life
[46:42] and lose it
[46:46] and if you amen
[46:48] are focused on the right thing
[46:51] and not the wrong thing
[46:54] then you should value amen yo
[46:57] so more than
[47:00] this life
[47:03] but if you interested on saving this
[47:06] life then
[47:07] why aren't you interested in saving your
[47:10] soul
[47:13] if you would do something and whatever
[47:16] it takes to amen to live a little longer
[47:19] in this life because you know the
[47:21] ultimate amen you're not going to live
[47:25] but a few days
[47:28] as job said the man that is born of a
[47:30] woman is of a few days and full of
[47:32] trouble
[47:33] are you with me
[47:35] if you happen to live three school years
[47:37] and ten and by reason of strength four
[47:40] school years you lived a long time
[47:45] but there is a amen jesus said that i
[47:49] come
[47:50] he said the thief come to kill steal and
[47:54] destroy
[47:56] but he said i come that you might have a
[47:58] life
[47:59] and that you might have it more
[48:01] abundantly
[48:03] praise god i want you to know amen that
[48:06] spiritual death sets in eternal life
[48:09] it's on the other side
[48:11] of the chasm
[48:14] oh yes brother sister amen there's a
[48:17] and there's a vaccine
[48:19] they meant that kills the virus
[48:23] they mean uh uh there is an antidote
[48:26] that takes care then uh covert 666
[48:32] and kill amen they meant
[48:35] that virus we call sin
[48:39] and sin amen when it sets in it'll cause
[48:43] spirits to death
[48:45] for the bible said the wages of sin is
[48:49] death
[48:50] but the gift of god is eternal life
[48:54] certain things i i won't say because
[48:58] amen
[48:59] uh
[49:00] i think i need a little series of
[49:02] teaching on it
[49:04] but i i'm just trying to give you just
[49:06] an
[49:07] uh a little bit of of what amen
[49:10] i'm dealing with this morning but it'll
[49:13] take a a a several lessons
[49:17] to sit down and talk to the church
[49:19] off the air
[49:24] and let's amen because amen i hope you
[49:27] understand because you're gonna have to
[49:30] read
[49:31] between the lines
[49:34] are you with me
[49:35] you got to understand that god
[49:38] amen is focusing in and got your
[49:41] attention
[49:45] i was telling caleb the other day
[49:47] when i thought on
[49:51] eternal life eternity
[49:55] and uh each
[49:56] it being a part a son of god that has
[50:01] eternal life
[50:04] i said what does that mean that you are
[50:07] actually have
[50:08] eternal life
[50:11] and him being the math major could
[50:14] understand that i'm talking about more
[50:16] than just words
[50:19] i'm talking about
[50:21] eternal life
[50:24] and
[50:25] and when we're talking about spiritual
[50:27] depth on the opposite side we're talking
[50:30] about eternal life
[50:34] where there is no depth
[50:40] and eternal life comes from
[50:42] oh let's go here in revelation 13 excuse
[50:45] me
[50:46] you got michael uh maybe i need a little
[50:49] read this morning
[50:51] praise god
[50:52] hallelujah eternal life amen
[50:57] now
[50:59] jesus said i come from god and i go to
[51:02] god
[51:04] he said i'm from above and you're from
[51:06] beneath
[51:10] and as i was praying this morning and i
[51:12] said oh how wonderful he is he said in
[51:16] john 1st john she said
[51:19] oh
[51:20] behold now are we the sons of god
[51:26] amen
[51:28] i i'm talking about the being the son of
[51:31] god that means you have a father
[51:35] and your father is
[51:37] god almighty
[51:40] and if you can walk and understand who
[51:43] you are
[51:45] praise god and you can walk with your
[51:47] head up
[51:52] i said eternal life
[51:55] resides in those that have been born
[51:57] again
[52:01] far amen you have
[52:03] the seed in you
[52:07] amen that you know amen that you've been
[52:09] born not of corruptible seed
[52:13] but incorruptible
[52:15] by the word of god we delivered and
[52:18] abided forever
[52:20] brother and sister he said he that
[52:22] believeth on me
[52:24] as the structure has said
[52:26] that out of his belly
[52:29] shall flow rivers of living water
[52:33] oh yes i'm talking about the holy ghost
[52:36] praise god
[52:39] we've gone into
[52:42] amen that we are going to mandate that
[52:45] you take the vaccine
[52:48] amen in order to work on your job in
[52:51] order to get a passport in order to
[52:54] travel
[52:55] oh yes
[52:58] it's been mandated
[53:02] on many of jobs in many places that you
[53:05] must take this
[53:08] in other words it's to save your life
[53:12] and help protect others
[53:16] and so folks are saying
[53:18] i don't see no harm in it
[53:22] and i'm not preaching on that but i want
[53:25] you to think about amen what's going on
[53:28] because it is setting the stage as i
[53:30] said from the beginning just that it
[53:33] shut down the whole world
[53:36] and has focused on the communist
[53:39] countries and also the capitalism and
[53:43] the whole world has been set down
[53:45] whether it's hindu buddha whether it's
[53:48] confucius whether it's mohammed or
[53:50] whatever the whole world will shut down
[53:52] for a moment
[53:56] i'm saying there's a vaccine in this
[53:59] uh virus
[54:00] covenant 19
[54:03] amen has
[54:05] it has affected everybody that dwells on
[54:08] the face of the earth
[54:11] brother and sister i'm saying the stage
[54:13] have been set
[54:15] and we're living in a time that
[54:18] amen that if your eyes will open you'll
[54:21] know that something is going on
[54:24] not what you're saying but the unseen
[54:27] realm
[54:29] oh god there's something on the cover
[54:32] taking place
[54:34] and i know that you don't know what's
[54:36] going on brother and sister because if
[54:39] you knew what was going on you'll run
[54:41] for your life
[54:44] you'll get on your knees and start
[54:46] crying out to god god help me
[54:50] the only safe place is in jesus
[54:54] the only safe place to hide from cover
[54:58] 19 is in jesus
[55:01] are you with me
[55:03] and covert 666 is in jesus
[55:07] oh yes you need to run to jesus if you
[55:11] can hear
[55:13] he said he
[55:14] oh goodness

[57:40] ever born

[57:46] god before you even knew who you were
[57:51] are you with me
[57:53] before you before the foundation of the
[57:56] world god foreknew you and saw you
[58:01] god knew that one day you would hear the
[58:03] voice you would hear the word and it
[58:05] would resonate with you it would be
[58:08] something inside of you i don't quite
[58:10] understand it but sure enough i believe
[58:13] it
[58:15] praise god there's something inside of
[58:17] you
[58:18] amen trying to find out who i am
[58:23] oh
[58:24] for what purpose am i living
[58:27] and why was i born

[58:42] amen and when he saw you he saw your
[58:44] condition he saw you in need of his
[58:48] saving grace
[58:51] he knew that one day
[58:53] you will hear the force of god
[58:56] why you could not ignore it why because
[58:59] you were a gene
[59:00] [Music]
[59:02] amen you were an attribute you were
[59:05] thought and you were part of god in the
[59:07] beginning
[59:10] hallelujah
[59:12] and god knew that you were part of him
[59:15] and through amen nothing that you can do
[59:18] to shake yourself away from it
[59:22] amen praise god because my sheep
[59:26] they hear my voice
[59:28] amen praise god when the father calls
[59:34] i want to answer
[59:36] amen he called me one day and i'm glad
[59:39] that i was able to say amen yes lord
[59:44] i know you died from me i know you're
[59:47] shining your blood god i know you did it
[59:50] for me
[59:52] i don't care what others say and i just
[59:54] think jesus you're my lord
[59:58] you're my god you're my savior you're my
[1:00:00] father
[1:00:02] amen and i can
[1:00:04] say lord i'm glad
[1:00:07] i'm glad that i
[1:00:08] recognize that i'm a son of god
[1:00:12] hearing that praise god and i that you
[1:00:14] are daughters and sons of god and that
[1:00:17] god is your father amen and you're a
[1:00:19] part of him that's where you came from
[1:00:23] you're here not by accident but you have
[1:00:27] a purpose for living now god brought you
[1:00:30] here amen because you had a plan for you
[1:00:33] and god in the destiny
[1:00:35] that you should walk in
[1:00:38] amen god knew that
[1:00:41] hallelujah
[1:00:44] oh yes
[1:00:51] and he says
[1:00:54] the lamb was slain
[1:00:56] from the foundation of the world you
[1:00:58] know jesus
[1:01:00] amen came about 2 000 years ago but in
[1:01:03] god's mind
[1:01:06] amen he was slain in the god's mind
[1:01:09] don't you know god thoughts are eternal
[1:01:12] and in the mind of god
[1:01:14] the bible says he knows the end from the
[1:01:17] beginning
[1:01:18] are you with me
[1:01:20] god david amen tell daniel to look and
[1:01:23] i'm gonna show you four beasts i'm gonna
[1:01:25] show you babylon and i'm gonna show you
[1:01:27] me to purge and i'm gonna show you
[1:01:29] greece at alexander the great and i'm
[1:01:31] gonna show you rome and i'm gonna show
[1:01:32] you amen the stone healed out the
[1:01:35] mountain
[1:01:37] amen i'm going to show you the end of
[1:01:38] the world amen and he told daniel
[1:01:41] set up the book
[1:01:43] and then seal up the sands
[1:01:46] until the time of the end
[1:01:48] i believe we're in the end time
[1:01:51] and i believe that which is seal is open
[1:01:54] now
[1:01:55] i believe the book amen i believe middle
[1:01:58] persia has come and i believe that uh
[1:02:01] oh god gracious has come and now legend
[1:02:03] of the great has come and i believe that
[1:02:06] rome has come
[1:02:07] it still is
[1:02:09] are you with me
[1:02:11] how can you not
[1:02:14] amen when you are son and daughter of
[1:02:17] god these things should be amen
[1:02:20] understandable to you
[1:02:22] praise god you're not you're not
[1:02:25] ignorant of what satan is doing in this
[1:02:27] last day
[1:02:29] he's trying to divert your attention
[1:02:32] and trying to get you caught up
[1:02:34] with this life trying to save this
[1:02:37] this life and trying to have a few more
[1:02:39] days to live and forgetting about your
[1:02:42] soul
[1:02:43] are you with me
[1:02:45] so the preachers are more preaching uh
[1:02:48] for this and for that and and not
[1:02:50] knowing that there's a greater enemy
[1:02:52] that's on the rampage and amen are
[1:02:55] called and people are meant to die
[1:02:57] spiritually
[1:03:00] go right ahead caleb
[1:03:04] if any man has an ear let him hear now
[1:03:07] that's that's the purpose if you got an
[1:03:09] ear to hear let him hear if you if you
[1:03:12] don't have an ear you can never hear
[1:03:15] because jesus said no man can come to me
[1:03:17] first of all my father was in heaven
[1:03:19] drawing
[1:03:21] and if you if you got an ear to hear he
[1:03:23] said let him hear because a lot of
[1:03:25] people can listen but they can't hear
[1:03:28] are you up me
[1:03:29] and a lot of people can hear they meant
[1:03:32] naturally but spiritually it does
[1:03:34] nothing for them

[1:03:54] sins
[1:03:56] to others it don't mean a thing amen in
[1:03:59] other words he died in to them
[1:04:02] it don't mean a thing and i believe that
[1:04:04] he didn't die in vain i believe his
[1:04:06] blood was shedded for you and i yes amen

[1:04:48] wait on god

[1:04:54] says in your patient possess you your
[1:04:56] soul

[1:05:02] amen sometimes we get tired of waiting
[1:05:04] on the lord and seem as though the lord
[1:05:06] don't care the bible says an account
[1:05:08] that the long shuffling of god is
[1:05:10] salvation god is waiting this wicked
[1:05:13] world is getting wickeder and wickeder
[1:05:15] but god is patient
[1:05:17] because he's long suffering if he didn't
[1:05:19] wait on you and i
[1:05:21] looked where we would be
[1:05:24] amen god was patient with us when we
[1:05:26] they turn our backs on him he didn't
[1:05:28] turn his back on us
[1:05:31] but he still was patiently waiting on us
[1:05:34] to come and give our lives to jesus
[1:05:37] are you with me
[1:05:39] god had a lot of patience with you
[1:05:40] aren't you glad he waited
[1:05:42] waited on you and i while we didn't want
[1:05:45] to listen we were ignoring him we would
[1:05:47] not hear him but god was patient
[1:05:54] long suffering
[1:05:58] go ahead on kill
[1:06:00] and i beheld another beast coming out of
[1:06:02] the earth now we know that america this
[1:06:05] is the united states of america
[1:06:08] the first beast came up out of the sea
[1:06:12] people multitudes nations and tongues
[1:06:15] this beast comes up not out of people
[1:06:17] nations multitudes and tongues
[1:06:20] this beast comes up out of earth this is
[1:06:22] the united states of america
[1:06:24] are you with me
[1:06:26] revelation 13 13 stars 13 stripes
[1:06:31] are you with me
[1:06:33] this is the united states of america
[1:06:36] let's say united states of america
[1:06:39] can we say that
[1:06:42] now where's america in the bible
[1:06:46] can a nation as great as america not be
[1:06:48] in the bible we know god can make god
[1:06:51] russian everybody else is in here well
[1:06:53] what about america she's here
[1:06:57] are you with me
[1:07:00] okay go ahead
[1:07:02] he had two horns like a lamb and he
[1:07:05] spake as a dragon two homes like a lamb
[1:07:07] remembered american buffalo
[1:07:10] two horns like a lamb
[1:07:12] are you with me then say was a lamb he
[1:07:14] had two horns what
[1:07:16] american buffalo amen
[1:07:19] it wasn't a nation
[1:07:22] multitude but it was out of the earth
[1:07:25] like a
[1:07:26] wilderness and it had two horns like a
[1:07:29] lamb
[1:07:30] remember the buffalo
[1:07:32] they met the head
[1:07:34] is up towards where the president's come
[1:07:36] out of harvard yale and not maine
[1:07:40] up that way
[1:07:43] most of the presidents come from that
[1:07:44] way
[1:07:46] and remember
[1:07:47] the feet are like texas and florida
[1:07:51] remember the heart
[1:07:53] like the bible belt
[1:07:55] south carolina and
[1:07:57] these religious times
[1:07:59] remember the backside was with
[1:08:01] california where all the field come out
[1:08:05] are you with me
[1:08:08] lack of lamb okay
[1:08:11] so here's america amen
[1:08:14] and how the god think about america and
[1:08:17] bible prophecy
[1:08:19] brother and sister if we don't wake up
[1:08:21] we'll wake up too late
[1:08:24] if we don't understand what's going on
[1:08:26] it'll be too late when you wake up it'll
[1:08:28] be too late
[1:08:30] amen
[1:08:31] but blessed are your eyes because you're
[1:08:33] seeing your ears because you're here
[1:08:36] are you with me because god could have
[1:08:37] you could have sat in church and shouted
[1:08:39] and danced in the spirit and forgot
[1:08:41] about your soul
[1:08:43] are you with me
[1:08:44] but when you hung and thirst after
[1:08:46] righteousness he said you shall be what
[1:08:49] feel
[1:08:50] but it's something inside of you just
[1:08:52] you just didn't want anything you didn't
[1:08:54] want to be fed anything amen you wanted
[1:08:56] to be
[1:08:57] fed the truth of god
[1:08:59] are you with me
[1:09:01] see some people they eat anything
[1:09:03] they're just happy to get anything amen
[1:09:06] but you don't want just anything you
[1:09:07] want the truth
[1:09:09] i want the pureness of the word i don't
[1:09:11] want anything i want the word
[1:09:14] okay
[1:09:15] so he says
[1:09:17] go come up out of the earth and hit what
[1:09:21] horns like a lamb and expect like a what
[1:09:25] now you remember
[1:09:26] america was very religious and
[1:09:29] very had a
[1:09:31] good foundation but after a while expect
[1:09:33] like a what
[1:09:35] dragon
[1:09:36] and you know satan is called the dragon
[1:09:39] the devil
[1:09:40] the serpent the devil it's called the
[1:09:42] dragon revelation 12. so here we are now
[1:09:46] it's specks like a dragon what is going
[1:09:48] on in america we have legalized sin
[1:09:52] and we have made sin acceptable
[1:09:55] and we spread sin all over the world and
[1:09:58] cause the nations if you if you want us
[1:10:00] to help you financially then you got to
[1:10:03] legalize sin too
[1:10:07] and if you don't legalize and they made
[1:10:11] if if you hate sin but not the sinner
[1:10:14] if you hate sin
[1:10:16] they said it's a hate crime
[1:10:19] to hate sin
[1:10:21] and people are fearful and scared for
[1:10:23] their life because they can't say
[1:10:26] anything about sin
[1:10:29] the preachers in the pulpit can't preach
[1:10:31] against sin no more
[1:10:33] because it's a hate crime
[1:10:37] see what they have done they've taken
[1:10:39] the bible amen and if you preach the
[1:10:41] word like it's written
[1:10:44] they say you can't do that
[1:10:47] are you up there
[1:10:49] so brother and sister where do you stand
[1:10:51] are you do you want truth
[1:10:53] and are you willing to stand up for
[1:10:55] truth
[1:10:56] are you with me are you willing to
[1:10:59] compromise because sin has become
[1:11:02] legalized
[1:11:05] the laws have changed and made sin
[1:11:07] acceptable and in the schoolhouse you
[1:11:09] must accept sin
[1:11:12] and one of the major things that they're
[1:11:14] pushing on us is homosexuality
[1:11:18] are you with me
[1:11:21] and it you know nothing against the
[1:11:23] person themselves
[1:11:25] many of people amen didn't have nothing
[1:11:27] to do with that condition
[1:11:31] we we've also got to accept adultery you
[1:11:34] can have three four five wives
[1:11:38] you know those sins that's in the flesh
[1:11:40] such as that
[1:11:41] amen
[1:11:43] it's been acceptable
[1:11:45] the laws have been changed to make sin
[1:11:48] so
[1:11:50] well off to people can do it and feel no
[1:11:52] condemnation now
[1:11:54] because the law has legalized it
[1:11:57] oh you would be
[1:11:59] just like they legalized alcohol and it
[1:12:01] killed so many people but they legalize
[1:12:03] it now they're legalizing marijuana the
[1:12:05] next thing they'll legalize is what
[1:12:08] all drugs
[1:12:11] people already in bad shape the world
[1:12:13] already
[1:12:15] it's going crazy
[1:12:18] oh you look man
[1:12:20] so what is going on we're going to keep
[1:12:22] father and father in sin now
[1:12:26] instead of doing like minimal
[1:12:28] the king got the whole nation to repent
[1:12:32] because
[1:12:33] he no judgment is getting ready to
[1:12:35] strike the nation
[1:12:36] and judgment is striking the whole world
[1:12:39] instead of amen dealing with the problem
[1:12:41] that we need to repent
[1:12:44] the world needs to repent of the amen
[1:12:47] and turn back to god
[1:12:50] but they won't repent because god said i
[1:12:52] gave a space to repent and she repented
[1:12:55] not
[1:12:57] god gave you an eye space to repent in
[1:12:59] our lives but we don't want to repent we
[1:13:02] want to keep on doing what we're doing
[1:13:04] and we're going to say it's all right to
[1:13:06] do it
[1:13:09] are you up man
[1:13:11] we want to make sin legal because
[1:13:13] somebody else is doing it and somebody
[1:13:16] else is doing it and everybody's doing
[1:13:18] it so we want to legalize sin in our
[1:13:20] mind we want to make sin acceptable
[1:13:24] so the church don't do nothing about it
[1:13:26] the preacher won't preach against it
[1:13:28] amen the people amen if you try to
[1:13:31] rebuke it to get mad at you won't get
[1:13:33] mad at sin
[1:13:35] i'm not saying get mad at the center
[1:13:37] because the center sometimes is just a
[1:13:38] victim of circumstances you don't know
[1:13:41] why people are in the condition they're
[1:13:43] in you don't know what caused that so
[1:13:45] you don't hate the person you don't when
[1:13:47] you want to talk against the person amen
[1:13:50] well we're talking about sin
[1:13:53] praise god where god can amen set the
[1:13:56] captive free
[1:13:58] amen god can heal the brokenhearted god
[1:14:00] can change the lives of those that have
[1:14:03] been caught a victim and captive of sin
[1:14:08] are you with me
[1:14:10] god can handle it
[1:14:12] brothers and sisters it doesn't matter
[1:14:14] amen how it happened what happened in
[1:14:16] your life god can deliver
[1:14:20] oh yes he can
[1:14:22] amen and still amen coming to the one
[1:14:25] that can help us we don't be satisfied
[1:14:29] because we think that there's no remedy
[1:14:31] there's no vaccine there's no kill for
[1:14:34] my condition but it is
[1:14:37] i said god got to kill
[1:14:39] god got a vaccine that can wipe out sin
[1:14:44] praise god the blood of jesus is still
[1:14:46] available
[1:14:47] they admit i said the blood of jesus is
[1:14:50] still available
[1:14:51] praise god if the blood the bulls and
[1:14:54] goats and the ashes will help if that
[1:14:56] blood amen that was put on the dope
[1:14:59] holes in the lantern could keep the
[1:15:01] children of israel healed
[1:15:04] praise god amen i believe the blood of
[1:15:07] how much more the blood of jesus
[1:15:10] amen he can heal with his strikes you
[1:15:13] healed
[1:15:14] amen he was wounded father transgression
[1:15:17] bruised for our iniquities just
[1:15:19] targeting of our peace was upon him and
[1:15:21] with the
[1:15:22] strikes we're healed
[1:15:25] brother and sister god
[1:15:27] has a healing virtue and he wants to
[1:15:30] heal you
[1:15:31] amen all you got to do is accept him
[1:15:34] and he'll heal you
[1:15:36] it doesn't matter where it came from it
[1:15:39] doesn't matter amen how helpless we are
[1:15:42] but god will help the helpless
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:49] i hope that you with me this morning i
[1:15:51] hope that you're understanding that god
[1:15:54] does care for you
[1:15:55] and that he does love you in spite of
[1:15:59] sin
[1:16:00] god does care for you he still loves you
[1:16:03] and we do too

[1:16:15] and push it
[1:16:16] go
[1:16:17] and he exercised all the power of the
[1:16:18] first beast before him and caused the
[1:16:21] earth
[1:16:22] and them which dwelt therein to worship
[1:16:24] the first beast whose deadly wound was
[1:16:26] healed
[1:16:27] and he dealth great wonder so that he
[1:16:30] maketh fire come down from heaven on the
[1:16:32] earth in the sight of men
[1:16:35] and deceiveth them that dwell in the
[1:16:36] earth what he does

[1:17:04] it's going to corrupt it gone anyway
[1:17:07] well what about your soul

[1:17:52] had power to do in the sight of the
[1:17:54] beast saying to them that dwell on the
[1:17:56] earth that they should make an image to
[1:17:59] the beast which he
[1:18:01] which had the wound by a sword and did
[1:18:04] live
[1:18:04] and he had power to give life unto the
[1:18:07] image of the beast that the image of the
[1:18:09] beast should
[1:18:10] should both speak and cause that as many
[1:18:13] as would not worship the image of the
[1:18:15] beast should

[1:18:23] to covert six six
[1:18:26] it's gonna turn after a while

[1:19:14] and how come the antichrist is here and
[1:19:16] i didn't know he was
[1:19:20] how come this we're in this kind of
[1:19:22] condition
