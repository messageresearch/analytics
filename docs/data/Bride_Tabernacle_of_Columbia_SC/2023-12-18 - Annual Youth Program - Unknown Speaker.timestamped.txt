[56:10] heyen Amen in
[56:13] closing we all know that all things are
[56:17] just for a
[56:18] season they are just
[56:21] temporary what happens when the job you
[56:23] work so hard for just let you
[56:25] go what happens when all the money runs
[56:29] out what happens when all your friends
[56:31] walk away and it feels like God is far
[56:33] away
[56:34] also look to your neighbor and say
[56:36] neighbor neighbor it's only temporary
[56:39] it's only temporary say neighbor
[56:41] neighbor but God is eternal but God is
[56:44] eternal when I think on the story of
[56:47] David and Goliath and how David was able
[56:49] to over overcome Goliath because it
[56:52] wasn't a problem that he was a giant
[56:56] oh it was
[56:59] a he was able in the eyes of God Goliath
[57:03] was just a small
[57:05] problem he knew that God already bought
[57:08] him through temporary situations before
[57:10] with the lion and the bear and he
[57:12] believed that God was going to do it
[57:14] again someone may ask me how do you know
[57:17] that God is real and I tell him I've
[57:19] seen him work time and time again in my
[57:23] life when I was in the dark
[57:25] and when I was deep in sin and I God
[57:28] told me it was only
[57:30] temporary but he is eternal always
[57:32] providing always saving always
[57:34] delivering and being a friend when no
[57:36] one else is how many want him to be with
[57:39] you always
[57:41] am please stand to your feet and if you
[57:43] want God to be with you always and not
[57:45] just temporary ask him to come into your
[57:47] heart
[57:53] today
[57:59] after the service we catch up with our
[58:01] money man let's listen

[1:19:28] the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:19:32] are not conal but Mighty through God to
[1:19:35] the pulling down of
[1:19:40] strongholds casting down imaginations
[1:19:43] and every High thing that exalted
[1:19:45] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:19:49] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:19:52] The Obedience of of

[1:20:01] your reading of this word you may be
[1:20:02] seated tonight
[1:20:07] amen amen tonight I'd like to speak on a
[1:20:11] little short topic that I entitled an
[1:20:14] invincible
[1:20:15] Army an invincible Army and as you read
[1:20:19] here in second
[1:20:21] Corinthians
[1:20:24] and it says for the weapons of our
[1:20:27] Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[1:20:30] through God to the pulling down of
[1:20:32] strongholds amen sometimes every day you
[1:20:35] wake up it's a
[1:20:37] fight sometimes every day that you get
[1:20:40] out of your bed it's a struggle every
[1:20:42] day that you you get up and there's
[1:20:44] breath in your body you have something
[1:20:47] to fight it may not be my situation but
[1:20:50] you got your own and you realize that
[1:20:52] God has created us in such a way that we
[1:20:55] have an answer for every battle we have
[1:20:58] an answer for every fight that we face
[1:21:01] and God has created us into an
[1:21:02] invincible Army and I I looked up the
[1:21:06] the word invinci it says it's too
[1:21:08] powerful to be defeated or overcome see
[1:21:13] when God created you he created you in
[1:21:15] His image and God he said that he
[1:21:19] created his word that you would be able
[1:21:21] to feed every stronghold that may come
[1:21:24] against you every demon and devil that
[1:21:26] may come against you you'll be able to
[1:21:28] feat them with one thing God's word
[1:21:31] that's all you needed to defeat every
[1:21:34] devil that may come your way every
[1:21:36] sickness every disease that's all you
[1:21:38] needed was the word of God he went to
[1:21:40] Calvary to shed his blood but he put it
[1:21:42] in his word so that we can read it and
[1:21:44] be reminded of what he did he said if
[1:21:47] you the prophet of God said if you want
[1:21:49] to grow closer to him each and every day
[1:21:51] all you have to do is read your Bible
[1:21:53] and pray that's all you have to do cuz
[1:21:55] when you read your Bible you're reminded
[1:21:57] of what God has done you're reminded of
[1:22:00] how God far God has how many things he's
[1:22:03] given you and how many blessings he's
[1:22:05] given you see God's word is too powerful
[1:22:08] to be defeated it's Invincible it's the
[1:22:11] only thing that you can has tried and
[1:22:13] true and has been tested and it will
[1:22:15] always work no matter you can try many
[1:22:19] things but when you try God there's
[1:22:21] nothing else that you need need he said
[1:22:23] everything that I need he's already
[1:22:26] provided and he has created each and
[1:22:28] every one of us to be a part of this
[1:22:30] invincible
[1:22:32] Army that that's are God's troops as the
[1:22:35] young people said I'm a Christian
[1:22:37] Soldier marching on the war with the
[1:22:39] cross of Jesus going on before see God
[1:22:42] is creating You In His Image he's doing
[1:22:45] a thing that he's doing a work said the
[1:22:47] song says something on the inside is
[1:22:50] working on the outside and oh what a
[1:22:52] change in my life see when God changes
[1:22:55] you nobody can turn that around all it
[1:22:58] takes is one word and God can do the
[1:23:01] rest all you have to do is say Lord I
[1:23:03] Surrender and that's all you need to do
[1:23:06] God to show up and do everything else
[1:23:08] that you need and he will make you so
[1:23:10] that you will be invincible so when the
[1:23:12] Devil comes your way you said uh-uh I
[1:23:14] got something for you he said when the
[1:23:17] weakest Christian get on his knees when
[1:23:19] the weakest one you said maybe I ain't
[1:23:22] pray in a long time all it take is one
[1:23:24] prayer to change your life all it takes
[1:23:27] is one time you getting down on your
[1:23:28] knees and say Lord I need help Lord I I
[1:23:32] come before you it's not my sister not
[1:23:34] my brother not my mother or my father
[1:23:37] but Lord It's Me Oh Lord standing in the
[1:23:39] need of prayer and said God he gave us
[1:23:42] the greatest weapon which was his word
[1:23:45] and as long as you have faith in his
[1:23:47] word you cannot be defeated as long as
[1:23:51] you have faith in the Lord that I trust
[1:23:53] your word is true then you know that all
[1:23:55] things are possible you know that
[1:23:58] everything that you ever wanted is
[1:23:59] possible if you go to God and he said if
[1:24:02] you ask it shall be given to you but he
[1:24:05] said you don't get what you ask cuz you
[1:24:07] ask a miss so you got to ask for the
[1:24:09] right thing but I tell you you'll never
[1:24:11] go wrong if you say Lord I want your
[1:24:13] will to be done you'll never go wrong if
[1:24:16] you say Lord I want you to take control
[1:24:18] you'll never go wrong if you say Lord I
[1:24:21] want you to lead and guide me you'll
[1:24:23] never go wrong you'll be a part of that
[1:24:25] Invincible Army cuz God will be in you
[1:24:28] and God said I he has to receive his own
[1:24:31] see he he'll receive you because you you
[1:24:34] are in the image of him and in his
[1:24:37] likeness in Ephesians it says Ephesians
[1:24:41] chapter
[1:24:43] 6 and
[1:24:45] verse Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10
[1:24:48] it starts all says finally my brethren
[1:24:50] be strong in the Lord and then the power
[1:24:53] of His might and put on the whole armor
[1:24:55] of God that you may be able to stand
[1:24:58] against the Ws of the devil he said put
[1:25:00] on the whole armor see when you in this
[1:25:02] Army you got to put on something you got
[1:25:04] to put on this armor and that you may be
[1:25:07] able to stand against the wise of the
[1:25:09] devil see you won't stand otherwise you
[1:25:12] won't stand otherwise for we wrestle not
[1:25:15] against flesh and blood but against
[1:25:17] principalities against Powers against
[1:25:20] the rulers of darkness in this world
[1:25:22] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:25:24] places see some of your battles ain't
[1:25:26] even people it ain't even your sister or
[1:25:29] your brother it's things that you cannot
[1:25:32] see it's things that are hidden from you
[1:25:35] unless God open your eyes to see like he
[1:25:37] did to Elijah servant you won't be able
[1:25:40] to see what you're fighting but you have
[1:25:42] to get down and said Lord you can take
[1:25:44] care of the battles that are unseen you
[1:25:46] can take care of the things that I
[1:25:48] cannot see and he said wherefore take
[1:25:51] unto you the whole armor of God that you
[1:25:53] may may be able to withstand in the evil
[1:25:56] day how many know that we in an evil day
[1:25:59] it's evil everywhere that you turn and
[1:26:02] having done all to stand done all to
[1:26:05] stand stand
[1:26:08] therefore sometimes you got to take a
[1:26:10] stand I was working with a little
[1:26:12] thought and I called it
[1:26:13] compromise I said sometimes we get the
[1:26:16] situations where we compromise and said
[1:26:18] I ask you have you compromised but
[1:26:21] sometimes it says here you got to stand
[1:26:24] you got to take that stand you got to
[1:26:26] stand up and said I know what's right
[1:26:29] and I'm going to do what's right it's
[1:26:31] one thing to know it but it's another to
[1:26:33] do it see you got to follow it with some
[1:26:35] actions you might have been taught it
[1:26:37] all your life but you got to do
[1:26:39] something with it you said Lord I need
[1:26:41] you and see if you go to him he'll help
[1:26:43] you stand see it's not you standing by
[1:26:46] yourself said he said I'll never leave
[1:26:48] you nor forsake you I'll be with you
[1:26:50] always even to the ends of of the world
[1:26:52] see God will always be there right there
[1:26:55] with you that's why he told you to stand
[1:26:57] he wouldn't have told you to stand if he
[1:26:59] wasn't going to be there said there was
[1:27:02] said God will always be there with
[1:27:05] you he said stand therefore having your
[1:27:08] loins G about with truth and having on
[1:27:11] the Blessed pray of righteousness and
[1:27:13] his feet Shaw with the preparation of
[1:27:15] the gospel of peace say sometimes when
[1:27:18] you walk into places you want peace but
[1:27:21] you got to have the gospel with you said
[1:27:24] Prat sh with the preparation of the
[1:27:26] gospel of peace above all taking the
[1:27:29] shield of Faith wherewith you may able
[1:27:31] to quench all the fiery darts of the
[1:27:33] wicked said all you need is facei he
[1:27:36] said it'll be a shield for you said if
[1:27:39] you have the shield of Faith it'll
[1:27:41] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:27:43] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:27:46] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:27:48] God see with this sword you can defeat
[1:27:51] every devil with this sword you can walk
[1:27:53] into places that you never thought and
[1:27:55] God will give you dominion over them you
[1:27:58] can walk in there and say Lord I need
[1:28:00] peace in my workplace Lord I need peace
[1:28:02] in my school Lord I Want Your Presence
[1:28:05] to be with me but see you got to have
[1:28:07] God in you first you can't go into place
[1:28:10] and say I want peace and God ain't with
[1:28:13] you you got to have them in you amen and
[1:28:16] he said take to in the sword of the
[1:28:18] spirit which is a word of of of God in
[1:28:22] verse 18 He said praying always with
[1:28:25] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[1:28:28] that's how you get stronger each and
[1:28:30] every day it's praying always he said in
[1:28:33] the scripture one of the most powerful
[1:28:35] verses it's only three words he said
[1:28:37] pray without ceasing said you want to be
[1:28:40] a part of that Invincible Army are you
[1:28:43] praying are you are you getting to it
[1:28:46] and he said the reason I said I think
[1:28:49] about Jesus when he went and he was
[1:28:51] tempted he said the reason why the devil
[1:28:54] could not be defeat could not defeat
[1:28:56] Jesus was because he used the word see
[1:28:59] he he was a part of that Invincible Army
[1:29:02] and he had the tools to defeat the devil
[1:29:05] and he used the word and all he said was
[1:29:07] it is written said he he might not have
[1:29:10] known exactly where it said God knows
[1:29:12] all things but sometimes you may not
[1:29:14] know exactly where but if you can quote
[1:29:16] the scripture and say by your stripes
[1:29:18] I'm Healed I believe something that
[1:29:20] happened for you if you go around on
[1:29:22] your knees and say Lord by his stripes
[1:29:24] I'm Healed Lord your promise did not put
[1:29:26] more on me than I can bear I believe
[1:29:28] godov some things in your situations he
[1:29:31] said it is written that even death could
[1:29:34] not
[1:29:35] hold death couldn't hold him because it
[1:29:38] was written that death had to go away it
[1:29:41] was written that death would be defeated
[1:29:43] so everything that you think about and
[1:29:45] you go through it is written that God
[1:29:47] has given you the answer to he has given
[1:29:50] you the key to unlock lock every door
[1:29:53] he's giving you the key to walk out of
[1:29:55] situations that you thought you couldn't
[1:29:56] walk out of he's giving you the key to
[1:29:58] say by a strikes I'm here he's giving
[1:30:01] you the key of deliverance we have
[1:30:03] testimonies that can tell you what God
[1:30:05] has done we have testimonies and I look
[1:30:08] back even in my own life and I seen how
[1:30:11] God has allowed me to do allowed me to
[1:30:13] open doors for me I said I prayed a
[1:30:16] prayer this year and I seen I said many
[1:30:19] years ago and this is happened this year
[1:30:22] I prayed a prayer and I said Lord I I
[1:30:25] finished University and I said I'll only
[1:30:27] go back if it's it's somebody's paying
[1:30:30] for it I prayed that prayer and some
[1:30:33] people don't know the first time I went
[1:30:35] it was by a prayer when I told the Lord
[1:30:37] I got down on my knees I said Lord I
[1:30:39] don't have the money my parents don't
[1:30:41] but Lord you provide away well he did in
[1:30:44] end they paid me to go to school that
[1:30:46] was the first time so then I said well
[1:30:49] if God did it once can he do it again
[1:30:53] and I said sometimes you might pray the
[1:30:55] prayer and it take years to see the
[1:30:57] fruition of that said I went and I some
[1:31:01] things happened in my life and things
[1:31:03] changed and I said you know what I'm
[1:31:05] going to have a conversation about some
[1:31:07] information and when I went and talk to
[1:31:09] the person they said let me let me see
[1:31:12] what we can do for you and we can do for
[1:31:14] you and I went and I talked to them and
[1:31:17] they said well I was looking at one
[1:31:19] program and they said well let me see
[1:31:22] and I said I'm not doing it if it's not
[1:31:24] funded they said okay we understand and
[1:31:27] then God worked out a way that they
[1:31:29] found a scholarship to cover all my
[1:31:32] tuition for two
[1:31:34] years and see God is able to do
[1:31:38] exceedingly abundantly more than you can
[1:31:39] ever ask or think said when you you got
[1:31:42] to have faith in it though you got to
[1:31:44] when people tell you ah just go ahead
[1:31:46] and let somebody else pay for it or let
[1:31:48] this happen or let this happen you got
[1:31:50] to have faith and believe in what you
[1:31:52] prayed for and nobody can persuade you
[1:31:54] otherwise you got to believe that if you
[1:31:57] quote the scripture Lord by your strikes
[1:31:59] I'm heal I believe healing will happen
[1:32:02] you might have to wait on it but God he
[1:32:04] always has the right timing it's not
[1:32:06] your timing or your sister or your
[1:32:08] brother it's his timing and he knows
[1:32:10] exactly when to do
[1:32:12] it he said and that and that's what God
[1:32:16] is doing he's creating a people that
[1:32:19] will be an invincible Army said God's
[1:32:23] word it exposes Satan it revealing his
[1:32:26] Works attempt the destruction of God's
[1:32:29] people and and discrediting of God's
[1:32:32] word right down to the T to the time he
[1:32:35] is cast into the Lake of Fire see he
[1:32:38] fights that he cannot understand it he
[1:32:41] knows that if the people get the true
[1:32:44] revelation of the true church and what
[1:32:46] she is and what she stands for and and
[1:32:50] that she can do the Great Greater Works
[1:32:52] amen he promised that you would do
[1:32:54] Greater Works and he said she will be an
[1:32:56] invincible Army he said if they get a
[1:33:00] true revelation of the two Spirits
[1:33:03] within the framework of the Christian
[1:33:05] church and by God's spirit
[1:33:08] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:33:11] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:33:13] her so you got to understand who you are
[1:33:17] you got to understand what day and time
[1:33:19] that you're living in and you got to
[1:33:21] understand that once you have that
[1:33:22] understanding you can be an invincible
[1:33:25] Army you can be an invincible Army that
[1:33:27] can withstand all the Ws of the devil
[1:33:30] once you understand it and you can go
[1:33:32] into deeper and understand it that God
[1:33:34] has done greater he has done and given
[1:33:37] you the power to to withstand in this
[1:33:40] evil day you can you can go on and you
[1:33:43] can shout and you can thank God because
[1:33:45] you know where you stand it's not a
[1:33:47] mystery to you what where your name is
[1:33:50] written it's not a mystery to you will
[1:33:52] will you find out he said if he said in
[1:33:55] Acts 238 repent and be baptized every
[1:33:58] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:59] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:34:01] Holy Ghost and once you have the Holy
[1:34:03] Ghost he'll lead you to all truth he'll
[1:34:05] lead you into everything that you're
[1:34:07] supposed to know some people you got to
[1:34:09] you got to lay by the wayside because it
[1:34:11] wasn't meant for them you had to go on
[1:34:14] and say Lord I want what's for me Lord
[1:34:16] if you got it for me it said what God
[1:34:18] has for me it is for me so I can step on
[1:34:22] and be a part of this invincible Army
[1:34:24] cuz God created me to be this I it's not
[1:34:27] it's not out of my normal it's not
[1:34:29] something that I'm trying to put on it's
[1:34:31] who I am it's not something that I'm
[1:34:34] trying to be it's who I am see I I I can
[1:34:37] be a conqueror because God made me that
[1:34:39] way I can step in the room with Victory
[1:34:42] because God Made Me Victorious I can
[1:34:44] step in the room and say God is a
[1:34:46] provider because that's what he made
[1:34:48] himself to be to me say he might not
[1:34:51] have Prov provided but for you but he
[1:34:52] provided for me said he healed me when I
[1:34:55] was sick he was a lawyer as they said in
[1:34:57] the courtroom see some people have that
[1:34:59] testimony that God will get you out of
[1:35:02] situation when there is no help that God
[1:35:05] will do things that are unseen behind
[1:35:08] the scenes and people will speak for you
[1:35:10] when it when when when you thought they
[1:35:12] might have been your enemy see God will
[1:35:14] do the unthinkable because he's creating
[1:35:17] an invincible Army one that'll step
[1:35:19] forward and say by
[1:35:22] that a step forward and say God I know
[1:35:24] that all things are
[1:35:26] possible God I know that all things are
[1:35:30] possible say God I know that all things
[1:35:33] are possible if I only
[1:35:36] believe so are you believing tonight do
[1:35:39] you trust that God can do the impossible
[1:35:43] do you trust that God I don't know what
[1:35:45] you what your situation is or what you
[1:35:47] may go through but do you trust that God
[1:35:49] can do it God God can fix it God can
[1:35:52] turn it around and it may be just like
[1:35:55] the children was saying in your homes
[1:35:58] sometimes it takes the children to pray
[1:35:59] for parents sometimes it takes the
[1:36:01] children to pay for the grandparents to
[1:36:04] pay for the ones that they want to see
[1:36:06] saved it can start in you it can start
[1:36:09] in you it can start in you it doesn't
[1:36:11] have to be someone grown sometimes it's
[1:36:13] by the child that shows the leadership
[1:36:16] that shows the parents hey I got to get
[1:36:18] myself together cuz this child wants to
[1:36:21] go to church this child wants to be in
[1:36:23] the house of the Lord so I got to figure
[1:36:25] out a way to get there because they want
[1:36:27] to be there see I got to figure out a
[1:36:30] way to be on time to be early cuz they
[1:36:32] want to be there they're excited about
[1:36:34] what God is doing said are you excited
[1:36:37] about what God is
[1:36:39] doing see but when you get that hunger
[1:36:42] and thirst you you don't want to be
[1:36:44] there nobody is convincing you that you
[1:36:47] got to go nobody is telling you I got to
[1:36:50] go yeah we going to
[1:36:55] church uh we going to we got to go to
[1:36:57] church tonight see sometimes when when
[1:37:00] God has placed it in you that hunger and
[1:37:02] thirst and you become part of that
[1:37:04] Invincible Army you will be excited to
[1:37:07] go to church you want to go you're happy
[1:37:09] to go because God has done the work in
[1:37:12] your life and all you have to do is say
[1:37:14] Lord I
[1:37:15] Surrender and when you surrender
[1:37:18] sometimes he going to take you down
[1:37:19] paths that you didn't think you was
[1:37:21] going to go he going to take you places
[1:37:24] that you didn't think you was going to
[1:37:25] go and it's going to be because you said
[1:37:27] Lord not my will but yours be done and
[1:37:30] he going to put you in places that you
[1:37:32] never thought you would be and you might
[1:37:35] have said I don't even want to be there
[1:37:37] I'm one of those people when I was
[1:37:39] growing up I said I don't want to do
[1:37:41] that that's not for
[1:37:43] me but that's not is different when God
[1:37:46] has placed that calling in your life
[1:37:48] it's different when God has and said it
[1:37:50] doesn't matter what position it is if
[1:37:53] you are in your position it's valuable
[1:37:56] it's valuable you may said well I I I
[1:37:59] want to be this or this but if God got
[1:38:00] you here there's a
[1:38:02] reason God has each soldier in an army
[1:38:06] has his thing that he has to do
[1:38:09] everybody can't be on the front line
[1:38:12] everybody can't be in the back there's
[1:38:14] people in the middle everybody has a
[1:38:17] role that they have to play and it's
[1:38:19] only if the if the if everyone does
[1:38:22] their role correctly maybe you'll end up
[1:38:25] going out of there and being successful
[1:38:28] sometimes it's not cuz the enemy is too
[1:38:29] great but there's no enemy that's
[1:38:31] greater than that can that can go
[1:38:33] against God and win God has the answer
[1:38:37] and he has the key to unlock every door
[1:38:40] because you are a part of an invincible
[1:38:42] Army
