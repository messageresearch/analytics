oh god for blessing us lord we love you in jesus christ's name we pray amen glory we want to look at the book of luke by god's grace luke 6. [Music] god is good amen luke 6 and we'll begin at the 17th first or we'll begin at the 27th first you got to say amen and it reads but i say unto you which here love your enemies and do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take away thy coat also you may be seated we'll read a little further down give to every man that asks of thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again and as you would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise for if you love them which love you what thank have you what thank have you for sinners also love those that love them and if you do good to them which do good to you well thank have you for sinners also do even the same and if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what thank have you for sinners also lend to the sinners to receive as much again but love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind to unto the unthankful and to the evil but ye therefore be therefore merciful as your father also is merciful let's drop down here to the 46th verse and it reads and why call you you me lord lord and do not the things which i say whosoever come up to me and hears my sayings and do it them i will show you to whom he is like he is like a man was building a house and dig deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood rose and the stream beat vehemently upon the house and could not and could not shake it for it was founded upon iraq but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built in house upon the earth against which the stream did vehemently beat i mean did beat behemoth vehemently and immediately it failed and the ruin of that house was great may god of the blessed reading of his word tonight by god's grace uh for a short moment i want to speak on a topic and i entitled it foundation amen the foundation you know us ministering here on sunday and how you know is looking at some things and and how you know paul began to talk about you know that we are we are built you know god is using us as a building come on let's look at i'll just turn that ephesians 2 by god's grace ephesians 2 and the 19th verse we're talking about foundation tonight ephesians 2 and 19 and it says now therefore you are no more strangers than foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom we all fitly framed together growth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom he also built it together for the habitation of god through the spirit see god he was talking about building a house but it says that we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets but he says jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone so you know looking at it the house ain't nothing without christ the with without him being the chief cornerstone come on the house of fall you know i was sharing with the church the other day i said you know when we're looking at it even here in ephesians 2 it talks about you can go home and read it in your spare time it talks about grace and the grace that god has given us and how we are saved by grace and not of works lest any man should boast so many times we look at the works and the things that we achieve and the things that we may have done in this life but nevertheless you know we're not saved by those things but we're saved by the grace of god the bible said we're with the love that he loved us so everything that we are and all that we can become even tonight it's only because of him that's where it starts at the building must start with him you know it says that you know before a person come to god they they should come to god under no unders no other circumstances other than recognizing that they are lost and they need a savior you know sometimes people say well i just gave my life to the lord just to turn a new leaf for or i game because you know i know it's the right thing to do well when you do it that way you know that ain't even starting out right come on so you know even when we're talking about building a house that house you can't start from the roof like i said many times you can't stop from the roof down but you got to start from the bottom up come on and the foundation is the most important part of the structure so if the foundation ain't laid right you find that you many times we see people they run for a long time maybe for years and years and then all of a sudden something happened and it and it and it uh uh knocks them out come on but nevertheless i like how jesus and i know i may get ahead of myself was here speaking about you know the foundation gotta be right jesus speaking on that he says i'ma tell you and he's beginning to talk about certain things he says that i tell you he that heareth my sins and do them he said i'ma tell you what that man is like he said that man is is like the one who dug deep come on and he dug deep until he found a rock and that's what he started building on he says but and then when the when the winds or we just paraphrase it when the floods came and the winds began to blow and all that i like the terminology he used he said that it couldn't shake the house because it was built on on a rock come on and i looked at that even you know i was looking at last week we had a storm so bad that's where i get a lot of the sermon from a week for last it was a storm so bad it was rain and down pouring the wind was blowing looked like it was going to shake the whole car and turn it upside down but nevertheless you know being in that it was only a little while later and then the rain already let up and the sun was already out come on and i says that you know just uh relating it to our life you know we in times we hit those times where the wind's going to blow come on where the rains are going to fall where the the the life itself seemed to be turning you upside down so jesus wants to prepare us for those times he gives us his word he gives us instructions on how to build a house come on on how to start because he knows that when you in this life storm's going to come flood's going to come and all those things he says but i'm going to tell you how to make it through that how many believe that tonight so we find that i says what it is you know jesus says he that keeps my sin i read that even in the beginning because i even like how when we talked about the beatitudes and things and how jesus gave us certain things that we ought to govern our lives by he said to for once he said to love your enemies come on and to bless them that curse you you know in the hour that we live in in the time that we live in that's almost uh uh one of the sins that people would laugh at today in the world that we live in today how can you live that way well you within yourself you can't live that way that's why you got to dig deep hallelujah you got to get down on your knees and dig deep dig deep until you hit a rock until you find that place in youtu no more about you just like jesus when he was in gethsemane and and praying the bible said he prayed unto us i believe sweat was like blood he said lord if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but then i believe he dug deep enough come on they hit a rock and he said lord not my will but thy will let it be done get into that place within ourselves to we're not even looking at ourselves but we dug deep enough you know i was praying today and i said lord you know our our whole main objective and our whole goal is to make the kingdom come on you know you know he asked once he says you know he says what is the greatest commandment and they begin to tell him he says the love of thy lord god with all that heart with all that mind with all that soul and he began to tell him that yes that's the truth he says but you miss one come on he says you know he began to talk about certain things that we uh uh don't look at ourselves come on but we begin to look at the well-being of others how many believe that tonight so we're talking about like i said a foundation finding you know uh what what is going to keep us when the storm is raging what's going to keep you when the storm is raging you know you within yourself you will fall i like how david as i was ministering a couple weeks ago on david said i believed and therefore have i spoken thou kept thou has kept my feet from falling we we believe even an hour that we live in come on that what's going to keep us nothing but the power of god i believe that's what the bible says that we are kept by what by the power of god when we look at this life come on in the storms and the floods and the things beaten so very humanly you say how did you make it come on because i was founded on a rock and that rock had power in it to do what to keep me in the midst of what was going through how did your mind stay stable because when i did all i could do all i did was stand hallelujah i like how jesus said that and i'll say it again he says that that though when it beat up against the house it couldn't shake it come on you shouldn't let nothing shouldn't be able to shake you come on you might get startled a little bit but when you when you grab yourself come on when you get hold of of the situation when you grab yourself and realize come on that the battle ain't mine but the battle is the lord's how many believe that tonight so we find that i says the foundation you know sometimes we got to go and examine you know go back and inspect and over do another like we say an inspection over our life what it is like i said down at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light come on and the burns of my heart rolled away it was there by faith i received my sight and now i'm happy all the day come on where did you see that light was it at the cross come on or was it just in some social gathering or something just feeling good moment but did you did you uh journey to the cross yet to that place to where you saw yourself as wretched and undone come on i like how the bible says and when you read in ephesians 2 it says that we at one point in our lives when paul was talking to him and explaining to him that it wasn't your your effort in anything you've done but it was god and god alone he began to explain to them he says you were strangers you were outside of outside of hope come on it says that you were in the world without god come on and i think about that i says lord how miserable uh creatures we were in the world without god come on you know i was i was sharing with them the other day i said that you know my testimony is that i i wouldn't be where i am today if it wasn't for the lord come on and i heard somebody say i made it this forward adam come on but they said that in ignorance because you can't do nothing without them come on he even said in one place i'm the vine come on and you are the branches don't you know that the life is in the vine if god was to cut you off you wouldn't be nothing today what can you brag about come on he said it's not a works lest any man should boast god i got nothing to brag about all of my glory and i'm going to glory in thee lord in all of my lifting you said if i be lifted up come on then i'll draw men unto me come on what we ought to do today is continue to lift the name of jesus up because he's still drawn he's still pulling he's still living he's still delivering living he's still delivering today how many believe that you know but what it is like i like that he says to keep my sins come on you know how we live in an hour where it's hard to keep his sins to those that aren't born again come on that's why it's important for the need the need of the baptism of the holy ghost because what he is the teacher when he comes inside even when your feet would fall he would keep you from falling when you want to slide he would keep you from sliding he comes to your mind all the time and he says quit you like men hallelujah my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways lord but they did me this way i say love your enemies i say bless them that curse you come on i'm teaching you what's going to keep you in the long run i'm teaching you what's going to help you hallelujah how you how to build upon the right foundation how many believe that but what it is you know that's what it is many many times we come to christ we don't believe that our foundation is going to be tried we don't realize sometimes or we think just a little test come and that's it come on but the showdown is coming come on the fire will fall come on but he'll suffer you not to be consumed why because he is that consuming fire how many believe that tonight he is that living god and i thank god for that that's why we look to the unseen come on we look to the things that we can't see i don't know about you tonight but you look at this world these carnal things they fade so fast things are happening so quick like they say life is like a vapor here today and gone tomorrow but nevertheless that's why we strive we're striving as i was praying today we're striving for the kingdom of god lord we're striving for that kingdom we can't rest our feet can't rest until we find our place ourselves in our place in you lord our feet can't rest until we find our our part in the building come on you know paul says that you know we are we are a building we're a makeup of the house of god come on fitly frame together don't you know when you're talking about being fitted come on that means that nobody can't take your place you got a certain part you got to play come on you got a place in the building and without you the building ain't going to be complete come on so we can't try to fit ourselves in some other place but that's why we come to god and say lord not what i want to do but lord what will you have me to do i got goals and i got ambitions but i want to find my place in the building guard wherever it is god i want to find my place in the building how many want to find their place in the building and that's what it is finding uh uh uh your place but you know like we said the foundation we know that i says uh the foundation got to be right come on you know one of the one of the most mis ingredients that we'll say out of the foundation is repentance come on people don't like to repent the take the blame lord it's me god i'm sorry help me come on we don't like to say that sometimes when we know deep down in ourselves that we need god's help deep within ourselves that we're wrong and need god's help but pride sometimes won't let us get that law pride sometimes keep us from crying out to god for help but we get to those places sometimes where we're shaking i believe stanson got to that place the way pride it was done away with then come on his eyes were plucked out he was weak like every other man and everybody making fun of him i believe pride went out the window then didn't it come on then he could cry out lord have mercy on me forgive me i'll wrong you lord i've done wrong lord forgive me and and revive me lord come on renew my strength just this once more lord i'll obey you now hallelujah how many feel like letting go tonight come on but i says that's one most important i would say that ingredient out of out of the foundation coming to god with a repentant heart as we said no man should come to god under any other circumstances than recognizing that he's lost and he need a savior i don't care how good you've been what family you from come on what life you live what great works you've done then jesus said there'd be many on that day that said lord didn't we do great things in your name he said i'll say it apart from you workers of iniquity come on you that were connectedly i didn't even know you come on but it'll be those that recognize who they are come on recognize the condition of the life they're in and they say lord i need your help come on finding that i said the foundation you know storms going blow come on wind's gonna blow floods rain is gonna fall are you built on the right foundation tonight centering around what jesus christ and him alone no great church building as they say organization all these things but you built on christ come on on christ like they say the solid rock i stand no other ground all other ground i mean is shaking sand come on do you believe that tonight he says the one that don't that hears my sins and don't do them he said i'll show you what that man is like he said he's the man that build his house without a foundation just building on the quicksands when the winds blow you might make it past the first storm but when the next storm come it'll knock you out come on i said lord i want to be built right how many want to be built right tonight i said lord let me be built right let me get back to that place you know and that's what we desire to see to a place to where the people are broken come on to a broken and a contrite spirit to that one that come to the lord he said i will in no wise cast away didn't he say that i won't turn that one down come on because they come in right they broken they realize it i'm lost i need a savior hallelujah god save me i need your help how many need god's help tonight but he's talking about coming there you know broken he says i'll all i know wise turn that man down i want to say tonight come on the foundation i ask you the question is your foundation built right tonight come on we find that you know sometimes what do the storms do sometimes the storms they bring out imperfections in our lives they bring out things or just like jesus said you know love your enemies and all this you know these things they come to do what to try you don't they these situations saying they come to try you and a lot of times they bring out things in you the imperfections they show you the imperfections in your life that you can go back and work on them hallelujah you can go back and see where you left some doors open now these doors got to be closed and i can't stand at the door but i need the door here jesus said i am the door come on i need him to be the door i need god to watch those gates hallelujah that the wicked one might not come in in the night and destroy me hallelujah but in the middle of the night come on in the middle of the darkness even where we live at right now jesus is the door come on watching over us while we lay down at night how did i make it through the night because jesus was at the gate jesus was at the door he was the door hallelujah and he suffered not the enemy to come in and take me oh jesus how did you make it through the night it was only by the grace of god how did you make it through when the wolves were out there the demon powers in the darkness the wickedness in hot places how did they get pulled down hallelujah we were mighty through god hallelujah into pulling down the strongholds that's what it was god helped us pull those strongholds down the devil had fortifications and all these things against you but here come jesus help you to pull them down here come jesus making the way somebody said he made a way again hallelujah somebody said he showed up again what it was jesus the whole time doing these things hallelujah how many thank god for that tonight i said the foundation come on that's why i said we examine ourselves we forget certain things he says to keep my sins we forget certain things we leave off sometimes certain principles don't we and when the storm come i believe that we find ourselves not being able to stand as we ought to come on men out to pray always ain't that what the bible say come on we forget those things don't we and when the storm blow we wonder why sometimes we ain't strong as we ought to be we wonder why we ain't where we need to be come on i said build on the right foundation tonight [Applause] amen god bill on the right foundation amen on crisis solid rock i stand all over the ground is sinking sand amen the revelation of jesus christ amen god unveils himself to you as an individual the mighty god is unveiled before us and we thank god that he has amen god has revealed to us who he is without that amen we'll be just like those out there but he's revealed to us that he's savior and that he's lord amen praise god not only saved us from the wicked life that we used to live amen but he has prepared a place for us amen praise god he he he not only saved us the bible said he delivered us from the power of darkness and he has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son praise god we have been translated already praise god and we shall be changed and we already have been changed amen but these this martyr must put on immortality amen this corruptable must put on incorruption praise god but we have that incorruptible seed inside of us because when we were born again brother fred we were born not of corruptible seed but incorruptible seed they meant by the word of god amen the same word amen that spoke and said let there be light praise god that same word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we will hell his glory amen praise god when that glory get inside of you that quicken power that makes a difference in our lives [Applause] hallelujah god is good amen you love him today appreciate that foundation praise god no other foundation can any man lay than that which already been laid that is christ jesus amen praise god hallelujah we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone the stone that was rejected of your builders the same has become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes isn't that right praise god hi marvelous hallelujah to god be the glory oh hallelujah we're serving a good god a god of grace and mercy amen god bless you tonight praise god it's much to be done and god chose you to do it the continuation of the ministry of jesus christ is to be done by the
