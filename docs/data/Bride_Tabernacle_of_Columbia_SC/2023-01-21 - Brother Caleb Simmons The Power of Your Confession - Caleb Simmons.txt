the praise Lord we ask that you come and Lord bless and move us out of the way Lord that you may get all the glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen let's turn to the Book of Luke Luke chapter 7. Luke chapter 7 and we'll start in verse 1. amen when you got it say Amen and it reads now we he had ended all his Sands in the audience of the people he entered into Capernaum in a certain Centurion servant who was dear unto him was sick and ready to Jive to die and when he heard of Jesus he sent unto him the Elder of the Jews besieging him that he would come and heal his servant and when he came to Jesus there besought him instantly saying that he was worthy for him for whom he would he should do this for he loved our nation and he has built us a synagogue and Jesus said unto them and when he was not now not far from the house the Centurion sent friends to him saying not to him Lord trouble not thyself for I am not worthy that thou is entered unto my roof where wherefore neither that thought I myself worthy to come unto thee but I say in a word and my servant shall be healed for I am also a man set under Authority having under me soldiers and I say unto you unto one go and he goeth into another come and he cometh and to my servants do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard these things he marveled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel and they were and they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole that had been sick amen God bless the reading of this word you may be seated amen tonight I'd like to speak on a short little topic and I entitled it the power of your confession the power of your confession and this story is maybe a familiar story we heard a lot maybe in church and in our lives we heard this story a lot in where the Centurion he asked Jesus he had a servant that was sick he said he this Centurion came to a point that he realized that I'm not worthy for the presence of God to come into my home but if God would just speak the word if he could just speak the word then this sickness would be removed he doesn't even have to show up all he has to do is speak the word and I encourage you like it was a power that he confessed to himself you know I'm not worthy but the word that he speaks has power in it the word that God was going to speak had the power in it and it was going to be there was power in those words it was power because the person that spoke it believed Jesus believed that when he sent that word for as it said in his word his word can't return to him void so whatever he sent it out to do was going to accomplish what he sent it out to do amen and and see the Centurion he believed that the words of Jesus was going to heal his servant that whatever he spoke was going to happen whatever the Lord was going to speak unto him was going to happen he didn't doubt he he had so great faith Jesus even said I haven't found this great of faith in Israel his faith was so great he said you don't even have to come in my presence all you have to do is speak all you have to do is speak and when I implore you I was thinking about it and I and I remembered I said there was a God that created the heavens and the Earth but he didn't create it by forming it he created it by word he created it he spoke the word and it came into existence he spoke a word in in the worlds were created and I thought about it I said in in he says that we are Sons and Daughters of God if we are sons and daughters and God then he has given us the same power he has given us the same power to speak a word and to see things happen he has given us the same power to speak a word and see God move on the scene he is seeing God do the miraculous things by just the word with someone that believes in that word and don't doubt that it's true and it will come to pass as long as it's not contrary to the word of God as long as it doesn't contradict what he said here in the Bible so and if he says by his stripes we can heal we can speak the word and believe in it and it will happen if he said that I will deliver we can speak the word because he's already written the word all we have to do is speak it and believe and it shall happen because it can't return unto his his him void and that's what the Centurion he caught the Revelation that all I need is a word and to believe all I need is a word and to believe and everything will be all right and many of times I look at situations and I see him in life said all I need is a word and I think that's why God he he put their Bible so we can read it the prophet of God said if you want to grow closer to the Lord read your Bible and pray read your Bible and pray why why do you read your Bible so that you can gain inspiration why why why do you pray so that you can speak a word so that you can go to God in a word of prayer and you can get down and say Lord I need you Lord I need you to come down and fix my situation Lord I need your help Lord I need you to move in my life not in anybody else but my life see there's power when you get down on your knees and you and you get in contact with God and you know that there's something's going to happen whether you see it or don't see it you know to God as long as you continue to believe God is going to do something it may not be what you want him to do but it'll be exactly what he wanted he wants to happen it may not be it looked like the situation is getting worse but before the morning comes it gets the darkest before your blessings come the devil fights the hardest because he knows exactly where you're about to be but you got to continue believing and there's power in the word of God that's power and what he wants to give you see that Centurion to caught that Revelation he wasn't even a believer he wasn't even a church member he was a Roman Centurion in the army of the Romans but he caught a revelation that when God speak this word I can believe in it and there was power that was going to happen there was a power behind those words he didn't even have to be in my presence but I believe that this thing is going to happen and Proverbs it said there's death and life in the power of the tongue it's all in how you use it anything I even think about they say with technology nowadays you look at it and I say it's twofold it can be a blessing or it can be a hindrance it's all in how you use it and your words are the same way you can bless her you can curse you you can uplift or you can tear down but see there's power in the words that you use and you have to make sure that you're using your words the right way see there's a power in what you confess over your life because you can confess blessings or you can profess cursing you can do things by just the words that you say every single day and see there's power in it and see there's there was definitely life in the tongue in the power of the term But first you got to believe that the words that you are saying are true nothing can happen if you don't believe there's nothing that can mountains can't move if you don't believe you can speak at the mountain all you want but if you got doubts it won't ever move it won't ever move it's the slightest moment to God doubt I was listening to the prophet of God and he said there was this young lady she was in the prayer line and he said the Lord had gave him a revelation that she was healed she was walking on crutches and she came to him and she said and he said do you believe that that you that that you will be healed and she still had the crutches he said when you get to the end of the platform throw your crutches down and you'll be all right and she turned to him and she said but I've been on these crutches for so long and brother and the prophet of God said in that moment you missed it it was just that simple you miss it the power and the words were spoken but you missed it because you didn't believe said another lady came behind her and the brothers she was on crutches as well but the brothers they were carrying her and she might have been more ill than the other sister but she came to the exact same moments and the Lord blessed bless the prophet of God and she he got a revelation he said Do you believe and she said I have no choice but to believe and she and she got to the end and he said when you get to the end of this platform throw your crutches down and you'll be healed and she got to the end of that platform and she took off and she was completely healed see it was that simple the pop the words were there the power was in the words and the healing was there but one doubted and one believed see there was power in the words and one doubted and one believed that that one was going to be healed the other one doubted and said which one are you when you come to the moment and a word is spoken to you what you should do where you should go what should what should you believe in what do you do you question it or do you just go on and believe it do you just move on see there's there's power in the words that are spoken and said and the Bible says faith without works is dead see there's some action that has to happen once you believe you must go on you can't you can't believe and then go back and wallow in what you were in you can't believe and say I trust God but then go back to worrying about the situation you can't go back and say and say well and start thinking I don't know how it's going to happen but you see you got to move on and step forward and say I don't know how but I know it's going to happen I know that these things are going to change because there's power in the word of God there's power in what I confess to God and and give it to him and say Lord this is yours however you deem to work it out is your is it's up to you but I know that you're going to work it out for my good I may can't see what's going to happen down the road but I know that you are the god that can work everything to the good and as he says see there's power and there's power in your confession he says in the scripture in Mark chapter 11 verse 23 he said verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things that he said shall come to pass he shall have whatever he says whatsoever he said see it's sometimes it's that simple it's that small thing and it doesn't take this Centurion may not have had the knowledge of all the Pharisees he may not have studied the Bible of all years and times that some have dedicated their whole life to but he called a revelation he caught a revelation there was power in the words that Jesus was saying and all I got to do is believe all I got to do is believe and trust him and and my servant will be healed my servant will be healed that's all I got to do and see there was power in those words there were power in any and he said that he said if you speak the word that the mountain be removed and shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatever he says and sometimes you got to personalize it say I shall have whatever I say I should have whatever whatever I say whatever as long as it's not contrary to the word I shall have it because God promised it to me the god that created Heavens is Earth is the same God that's inside of me so why can't I have exactly what he has given to him if he said that you have dominion over the heavens and the Earth why not why why can't I speak those words and believe them to to be true because he's the god of God it's the same God if it wasn't the same God then the things wouldn't happen but he said I'm the same yesterday today and forever so if there was power in Jesus words what about you and I it was power in God's words what about you and I and do we expect the same things to happen that happened with Jesus or do we said and say that only happened to Jesus that can't happen to me or do we expect the same thing for God to move the same way he did for Jesus and I know he is he said that I'm the same God so it's not God that's the problem it can't be God that's the problem so it takes us examining ourself and say do I believe do I believe am I right with God is my life right it's am I am I living according to God's word if I am then these signs shall follow them that believe these signs shall follow them that I believe they shall cast out devils in my name see there's there's there's promises that God gave you to them not believe now them that believe in the power of the word that he gave you and all you had to do is speak the word and your will shall be done as Dr Jackson you sung the song He said all you have to do is speak the word and say that's all Jesus did when the devil came his way that's what he used to defeat the Devil the devil tempted him and say if the devil can tempt Jesus what about you and I but what do you use to defeat the Devil what do you use when you get to your trial in your tribulation what do you use to defeat the Devil do you use your words or do you use the words that he has given you to defeat the Devil Jesus wasn't looking for something new some new revelation Jesus was going back to the things that he was already said he said in the scripture he said thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God the scripture said he went back to the word of God because he knew there was power in that word there was power in what he was confession because God said I can if I speak my word it can't return unto me void and that was all he needed to defeat the Devil he didn't need nothing new he just needed the word of God he just needed a word that was already set before see there was power in it and he confessed it and professed the word of God and and he was and the devil left him alone because the devil can't do anything with the word of God even though he believes that he trembles because that word has so much power has so much power that even the greatest force that ever has been against God trembles at the word of God the greatest enemy of God trembles at the word of God and some people say it's just words on the page but there's power there's power in the word of God there's an anointing on the word of God there's a presence that comes when you when you bring the word of God into a situation you say Lord I trust your word I bring your word Lord you said when two or three are gathered in your name there I'm in the midst it's not us that's doing it it's him that's doing it it's him that's coming down and he and he said I'll vindicate his word to them not believe see you there's an important time when we got to believe that God is going to vindicate this word he's going to bring the word off the pages and we see it in life form we see him in our midst we see the Miracles the signs and the Oneness and God just doing miraculous things because he is God because he's still God and he's the same God that's been doing it all through history so why not now why not now where's the presence where's the anointing where's the God that I know he is the god that I've seen deliver the god that I've seen healed the god that I've seen set free where it's the same God I know he's here and know he's on the scene now I just want him to come in my midst and he may not come in anyone else but I want him in my life I want him on my job I want them in my home I want them in my room I want them everywhere that I go Lord I want your presence see there's so many people that may not want God's presence but I do I want them I want to believe Lord that you are the same God I know that you're the same God I want to see you do the Miracles I want to see you do the signs and wonders that I know that you are the god that's capable of doing exceedingly abundantly more than I can ask or think that's the same God that I know each and every day that's the god that wakes you up in the morning the god that allows you to go to sleep and still breathe all through the night that's the same God that make sure that you don't get in car accidents it's the same God that keeps you keeps you safe keeps you warm keeps you healthy keeps your progression every single day it's the same God said can I expect more of them yes I can because he can do more than what I'm expecting of him he can do more than I think about he can do exceedingly more than I limit with my mind that's the God that I know that's the god that works out things then when things that works out in the Unseen so there's so many things that God just blocks from around you like job there were so many things that the Lord was blocking the devil said you gotta hedge around him said Lord keep that hedge around me keep that hedge around me Lord and continue to protect me continue to Watch Over Me continue to bless me Lord continue to do what you want to do in my life see there's so much that I can look at and I may see Lord and all the things that may be going wrong but you don't know how much God may be blocking it could be a thousand times worse but God is still moving God is still delivering God is still setting free because that's the God that I serve that's the god that never said I'll never leave your nor forsake you I'll be with you always even to the ends of the Earth that's the God that I know see there's power in his word there's power and all I got to do is believe all I have to do is believe see see that's the God that I serve said the same God that created the heavens and the Earth is inside of me said the prophet of God said many people miss it because they don't know who they are they don't realize I'm a son and daughter of God and he's given me the same power he's given me the same anointing he's given me the same presence that was with Jesus he's given that to me when you have the Holy Ghost he's given that to you so so why are you struggling why are you suffering when God has given you the power to overcome when he's given you the power to overcome said maybe we take the wrong approach to what God can do maybe we don't expect God to do more than what we've expected now but it's time to take the limits off of God it's time to take the lid off of the jar and say Lord don't just fill my cup overflow Lord don't just fill me up to the top overflow Lord and overflow and let it run and run and run such a way that it blesses everyone around me not just me Lord but everyone Lord Jesus Lord I want to see everyone get to that level Lord sometimes the it says let the strong bear the infirmities of the weak and sometimes people aren't on that level they're not there but if you're in a seed if you're down there bringing them through it can bring them up to such a level then they catch it for themselves that they catch it for themselves that they can believe that there's power they can see according to what you believe in your faith in the word of God except when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember God will make your body come unto you come into your confession if you say that you're a drunker then want to drink don't worry you'll soon be one if you say that you're a sinner and want to sin you'll be right into it but if you say that you're a Christian and believe it all along God will bring your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed you confess it and God will make your body obey your confession but he is the high priest of your confession see whatever you want God to do whatever you want God to do in your life in the people around you all you have to do is believe in the power of God's word all you have to do is trust in the power of God words and that he said I cannot return no word back to me boy and must accomplish what I send it out there to do said your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that God has healed you confession and God will make your body obey your confession but he's your the high priest of your confession sitting on the right hand of the father now with his own blood to make intercession for any confession upon anything that he died for see he died to Rich sin and sickness is the result of sin so he was wounded for our transgression and with his stripes we will heal remember that have faith don't waver and stand on it stand on the word of God stand on it and don't waver don't faint because it may not come when you want it but he's always on time he may not show up when he thought he was going to show up and the situation may look more perilous the longer it goes on but he's still on time he's still the god that said I'm the god to healeth all diseases I'm the God to heal us all sicknesses and said when he died on the cross 2000 years ago it was the god that he cured everything he cured everything every sickness diseases everything that you may go through every trial tribulation it was it was done away with by the blood of Jesus and there was a blood there was power in that blood and it reached from the highest mountain to the lowest Valley he said everyone was going to have an opportunity to know Jesus died see there was power in in that death in that Resurrection and see the the power that was there is the power if you had a holy ghost that can be in you each and every day when you wake up you said Lord you can change what may happen to you just by what you confess just by the power that you believe in God's word atmospheres and situations may change just because of your prayers I think about the situation that just happened recently about the young man that that collapsed on the football field and and I said you don't know what prayer was the one that reached God to save a life you don't know who's prayer see there was power in the words of prayer there was power when someone got down on their knees in the words and they confessed and they got down and said Lord help that young man if if you can just imagine if if one of those prayers what about your prayer what about what you carry what you every day what could it do if you intercede for one person if you got down on your need and prayed for one person and just imagine you don't know that maybe God got someone else praying for that same person because he know what they're going through he know that they need the power of prayer to keep them going you he and you may not know what your prayers May accomplish and you may never see it but God is maybe using you to keep some people going further than they are to keep some people going it was the power of your prayers the power of the words that you uplift to them so what can God do what can't he do he said he's laid the foundation and he's opened the ways see that's the power that God has that's the power that he has given you and I that we can speak worlds into existence we can change the course of things we can't change the course of things but we can speak and that'd be Joshua's he pointed to the son and said Son stand still that's the God that I serve that's the God that I know wakes you up every single morning that's the god that when the Devil comes to tempt you and try you it's the god that stops you from doing what the devil wants you to do it's the same God that speaks to you each and every day when you want to do the wrong thing and he says don't do it and you listen but you got to believe in the words that's being spoken to you you can go through life many times and just go through the motion but it ain't till you believe and catch the Revelation for yourself things may never change if you don't catch that Revelation if you don't get to understanding that lord it's you that's doing the work it's you that's going to do this thing not me not anyone around me not my father not my mother but lord it's you that's going to do this all I got to do is speak your word and believe that all things are are possible that everything that I ask for Lord it may not be what I want but it'll be exactly what you want me to have it'll be exactly what you that you want and you see fit for me to have because that's the God that I serve there's no mountain that's high enough that he can't bring low and no valley that he can't uplift and bring High because that's the god that has the power and the word that he has given us that we can defeat every demon and every devil that may come our way foreign amen the power of your confession you know we heard a word tonight amen you know that I was ministering on thy faith has saved thee and go go your way your faith made you whole or go your way you know your faith saved you your faith did that and that's what you know what we're looking at here tonight the power of your confession you know I was thinking I says that we need God more now than we ever needed them before because we face with things we've never seen before look like we come to pass in our Christian Journeys that we ain't been here yet and and demons attacking on every hand so we need God more now than we we needed him ever before we need that faith that confession I was sharing with my nephew the other day I said as you know the thing is when most time a lot of people read the Bible they just look at it as being stories stories that's red stories that's told I says but you see here where it says he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed I says you know when Jesus was being whipped and they was taking that whatever they had and hitting them with it pulling that flesh out of them I says that you know that was for your healing I says but you got to have faith to believe it it's got to become more than just a story to you you know what what makes it become more than just a story to you and I when we have troubles and nobody can help us when we come like I was saying the other day to our ends with and we don't have no other options but to look up and say God you know I run out of options you know he should have been the first option but Lord I I'm just taking you at your word you know how many times we got down on our knees and and we just said Lord not nothing deep but Lord this is what your word promised God whatever the situation was Lord this is what you promised us in your word and God I need you to do what you said you'll do come on as God be God and where is all his miracles and you know God is still God today like I said we're going to need him we need him now more than anything faced with stuff you've never seen before never heard before and like I told somebody the other day I said it ain't over yet I says but at the first round knock you out or hit you that hard you ain't gonna make it out the second round that says but what it is is each round come we gonna get stronger how we gonna get stronger because that's the mode we're going to look to God that's tomorrow we're going to start looking to that unseen realm because the things that we're seeing failing us but what it is with faith you know Faith looks into that that invisible Realm and it sees the things that that what our eyes are looking at don't know nothing about and it brings things to pass you know that that normal wouldn't happen but that's what faith does but it starts you know I was looking at the other day it says faith without works is dead right you got faith but where's your Works where's your confession behind it come on I believe but but if you really believe there's no butts behind it I believe and that settles it God I take you at your word I believe you for what you said come on you know you can't you can't put that faith in somebody right but Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God that that individual he said he'd have to near let him hear when they hear the word of God you know it's something the Holy Ghost uh gives them the ability to hear but when it when it comes through that channel they heard it it does something for them don't it you know I was saying the other day I says what the problem is I says that we in a battle we're fighting these unseen forces don't know what we Face we we ain't been here before I say it's but God gave us weapons to fight with but we don't use those weapons I see one of the greatest weapons we talk about love all the time I said but but prayer pulling down strongholds I says but we all say we know that that's the greatest weapon that'll move mountains but we don't ever even use it do it and why did the devil fight you so hard because he knows as a prophet of God was saying when the when the weakest Christian get down on their knees in prayer demons begin to tremble things begin to shake and he knows that so he gonna fight you real hard in that area he gonna fight you real real hard in that area because he don't want you to get in contact with God he don't want you to come on but I said you got to find a way like the Bible says pray without ceasing I found myself now into sitting in the car everywhere I go every little two three minute here or whatever praying calling somebody name it's like a brother Keller was saying tonight you don't know what prayer got through calling Name Lord help him Lord save them God deliver them Lord Heal them Lord make a way for them you find yourself doing that and they say you know what happens God begin to move you start to see little by little God is doing something you know what when we talk about faith and things like that no it's just all we heard that we we know that yes you hadn't caught the revelation of it yet you hadn't seen it because if you did you'd be in action come on it'll make you move because you'll look and say Lord I got a situation I got a need I got troubles I got problems and God I've seen what you did for them I seen what you said in your word God now I need it I need your help I need a miracle today Hallelujah and I believe that God will bring it you know y'all believe that tonight come on the power of your confession you know we got to start confessing right let our confession be right I was looking at that as uh uh in Jeremiah 33 the other day and how the Lord was prophesied he was through Jeremiah about the Captivity and the people that are going astray but he's talking about how he was going to bring him back and he said I'm gonna bring a health and cure he said I'm a blessing I'm gonna restore him bring him back you know when they call upon me with all their hearts when they called out to me he said I'm gonna hear him you know got to hear you when you call out to him how many feel like calling out to him tonight oh Jesus what a word we heard tonight come on the power of your confession you look at situations battles you've been through your faith did that you confessed it you believed it and God was on the move Hallelujah thank you I'm so glad that the Lord bought me out amen it had not been for Jesus where would I be glad I'm glad that the Lord brought me out I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out if it had not been for Jesus where would I be I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out oh I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out I'm so
