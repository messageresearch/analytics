Amen. Truly God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The book of um St. Luke. Amen. St. Luke chapter 5. My topic tonight this morning, man, is taking God at his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Taking God at his word. Amen. How many God the word will not fail you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We see everything else is failing. We see the politics failing. Amen. The government failing, the the the the money system failing. Everything is failing. Only thing that won't fail is the word of God. Amen. So take God at his word. Amen. St. Luke chapter 5, start at verse one. It said, "It came to pass that as a people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gethinet and saw two ships standing by the lake, but the fishermen were going out of them and were washing their nets. And he entered into one of the ships which was Simon. I want you to realize this. Jesus Christ had not called Simon yet. Simon had just not met Simon." If you go book of four, read where Jesus Christ has healed Simon Peter's mother. Amen. So he did. They don't have they don't really have a relationship. Amen. But thank God if you're a child of God, God's obligated to come to you. Amen. Amen. So I just want you to get it right. So he's this is this is the this is the really the calling of Simon Pet. Amen. So say and to one of the and the ships was the Simons and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship. And now he had left speaking. He said to Simon, "Simon, launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draw." And Simon answered said to him, "Master, we have told all night. We have taken nothing. Nevertheless, at thy word, I will let down the net. And when they had did this, when they had when he had this done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and the net break. And they beckoned into the partners which were other ship, and they should come out and help them, and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink. Now remember, they ain't they fished all night long, but now because they listen to God's word, they got a big catch. Amen. I don't care. What come your life? Come in your life. You take God's word, you'll see the supernatural power of God in your life. Amen. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down on Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I'm a sinful man of of I'm a sinful man, oh Lord, for he astonished and all that was with him at the drop of the fishes what they had taken." And so was James and John the son of Zeb in the apartment of Simon. And Jesus said unto him, Simon, fear not, for henceforth thou shalt catch men. May God be your word. May we see this morning. Amen. Amen. So taking God at his word. Amen. How how many want to take God's word this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; When you when you take God at his word, you always to see the supernatural power of God. Amen. The only thing you can really trust in his hour, Amen, is revealed word of the hour. Amen. So I think about how the Bible says never I think the part says I let the part get up deal with say nevertheless at thy will &gt;&gt; at thy word, oh Lord. Amen. I'm going I'm going to the next scripture, but say nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. &gt;&gt; Amen. So a nevertheless mean, let me read this. This read this definition for you. Nevertheless, amen. The nevertheless means is like a change, a mindset change. So a nevertheless, the word nevertheless means it also means so be it or or as it is or not the same or or what difference does it make? But I'm going to get the point. A never a nevertheless means a transition from one idea or situation to another. Often highlighting a contrast or shift in perspective, especially from a human limitation. from a human limitations to the God's power. So, so I'm I'm taking a point where he remember Simon was born a fisherman. He had fished all night long. &gt;&gt; But now this is the morning time where Jesus say, "Simon, I'm I'm I'mma pre I'm I'mma use your ship this morning to preach the word." So, I'm going to go whatever you give God, you'll be blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you want to give God your money. &gt;&gt; Amen. your time, your whatever you give God, God can he can take a little and make a lot out of it. Amen. Amen. So you whatever your God God with your body, your mind and your soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; God want all of you. Amen. And once God give you give you whatever you give my thing, whatever you give to God, God will bless it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many How many like a return on the investment? Amen. &gt;&gt; But a lot of time you can put you can put in the stock market and you lose money. Amen. But in God, you never lose. Amen. How many God don't he don't remember God don't add he multiplies. Amen. So what point is this whatever you give to God will bless it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You realize I remember but how that Simon I mean like that I'm just feeling good man that that that that Samson gave God his strength but gave Elila his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God give every Amen. &gt;&gt; But God want all of you. Amen. Amen. My main point is for the young people also. Whatever you give God, God will bless it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It may be, oh in school, y'all in school now. Like I tell my daughters, you in school, I know you under pressure. I know that this this is s you are living in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you must be in the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's why you must let the word of God come inside you. How many know how many know how many people say that God keeps his word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Does God keep his word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if that word's inside you, can God keep you? Amen. Everybody say if if you if you abide in me and my what words abide in you, ask what you will. Amen. So the word inside you, God will keep you. Amen. In the midst of Satan, in mid troubles, by all your trials, if the word is there, God will keep the word. &gt;&gt; But you must keep the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz in this I'm tell everything else going to fail you. But one thing, the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, so, so it say he says, "And nevertheless, at thy word, I will cast down thy net." Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Also, let's go to St. Matthew right quick, man. I ain't going to be long. I want you to get a report. Whenever God tell you to do something is contrary sometimes to your natural belief, &gt;&gt; to your natural mind. So, that's why the Bible say you must have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; So, the mind of Christ, the mind, remember the Holy Ghost wrote the word. &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Ghost will believe all the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if God says do if God say like I say the Bible told them go over once. He told the children to go over once and possess the land at once. I have given you the land. &gt;&gt; When God say he can do something, you can do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just take God at his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So say go to St. Matthew 26 right quick in verse 39. It's very familiar. So never he said nevertheless. So so Simon knew I'm a fisherman. I done fish all night long. Me. So, but he knew he was dealing with when he saw when he took God at his word and we had he had he had enough fish that they had two ships to come out. He knew he wasn't dealing with a man. He was dealing with a he was dealing with God almighty. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you take God's word and see God does signs and wonders and powers and supernatural things, you know that you serve a real God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so I want to read it again. Uh when you say nevertheless means a transition from one idea or situation to another often highlight a contrast or shift in perspective especially from a human limitations to God's power or God's will. &gt;&gt; Also means nevertheless nevertheless with God is always more than enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you may not you may I say always pay your tithes and offering. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when you when you take God at his word, God's obligated to keep his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; God tell I pay I rob Peter to pay Paul, but I ain't robbing Jesus to pay nobody. &gt;&gt; I rob Peter to pay Paul, but I ain't robbing Jesus to pay nobody. Amen. He going to get his first. Amen. And everybody else can get the left on him, but God get his first. God will keep his word. Amen. And ever since I paid, ever since I put put my trust in and counted God, God had not failed me. Not one time. Amen. It got low sometimes, but it never ran out. Amen. Why? Because God keeps his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Don't put your trust in your money. You better put your trust in our money. God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Say Matthew 26. Amen. Verse 39. Now, here's Jesus. How many know Jesus was a He was He was just as much man as he was God. &gt;&gt; He was Jesus at Gethsemane. He's at his greatest trial. Say he pap say he got his victory at G. He had to overcome his own natural ability. I remember his flesh did not want to go to the cross. Amen. But thank God he you was on his mind. Amen. But the Bible verse 20 39 says and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me. He did not want to go. The flesh the flesh did not cuz no man every man want to live. Amen. The flesh did not want to go. Amen. But thank God when the Holy Ghost is inside, he overrides everything. Amen. Verse next verse says, "Nevertheless, as I will, not as I will, but as thou will." So who who was he talking to? He was talking to the God inside him. The word inside him gave him the overcoming power for that situation. &gt;&gt; The word inside you, we can overcome a power overcome power in every situation. Amen. Cuz the word of God will defeat the devil any place, anytime, under any situation. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the word of God must be inside you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good for you to have this word right here, but this word right here will do you no good if it don't come inside your soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word must become flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Nevertheless, not my will, but thy will be done." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One, let me show you one more thing. And nevertheless, the term nevertheless, so nevertheless from the can go from the positive to the negative or from the negative to the positive. It's all because how your perspective will help when you in a certain situation. Amen. So numbers numbers numbers chapter 13 if we will. Amen. &gt;&gt; So how many going to say no nevertheless at thy word Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my desire. Know I don't care what come my life you going to take God over every situation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Numbers 13:26. It says, "And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel and to the mids of Paran Kadesh and brought back word unto them that all congregation showed them the fruit of the land." How many know when God say you if God say the land is full of honey, that's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever God word say is true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God say you going to have a bride, he got a bride. &gt;&gt; If God say going to be a rapture, there going to be a rapture. Amen. And God say he going to take care of you, he going to take care of you. Amen. I ain't trusting in Trump. I ain't trusting Snap. I'm trusting Almighty God. &gt;&gt; I ain't trusting Medicaid. I ain't trusting this. I'm trusting in Almighty God. I'm trusting Jehovah Gy. You may take this. You may take that, but you can't take the word. Amen. So trust in the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take my social security. You may take take my 401k, but you can't take the spoken word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But take my snap. Amen. I need I need God. Amen. Oh, they going to take my snap. They going to say, "I got God." &gt;&gt; I said, "I got God." Remember, the same God that led the children of Israel is the same God that lead us right now. The Bible said they closed their way out. Their shoes their way out. They had food. They had water. They had everything. Amen. Why? They trusted in God. And that same God is here right now, man. Taking care of the pride. Amen. Trust in God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz everything else will fail you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On this big beautiful bill, I'm losing my losing some hours, but you still got your God. &gt;&gt; I'm losing my benefits, but you still got your God. &gt;&gt; Don't you think that God will be the man? Say, "The Lord is my shepherd." Amen. I shall not want. Amen. He shall be thy man. Have faith in God. Praise God. Amen. He always he's he's better than old star. He's always there. &gt;&gt; He's better than stay forms like a good neighbor. He's always there. Cuz like I say, you get enough existence, stay firm, we'll drop you. Amen. But I know a man who's always there. Amen. His name is Jesus Christ. Amen. Like a good neighbor. Stay farm is there. That's a lie. Get four axes in the road. They'll drop like a hot kick. Amen. I'm a living witness. Amen. They will drop you like a hot kick. Amen. But I know a man. &gt;&gt; I know a man who's faithful than you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 27 says, "And they told him and said, we came into the land where thou sent us, and surely it flowth with milk and white." You know why? Because God word says so. &gt;&gt; Flow milk and honey. And the and and that the fruit of it. But verse 28 says, "Nevertheless," this what he messed up at the positive shift to a negative &gt;&gt; because of instead of looking at the prompts, they look at the situation. Never look at the situation. &gt;&gt; Never look at the condition. Always look at the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God.

So you see, so we see that the Bible said they said, "Nevertheless, we ain't going." Right? And and and they telling God said, "God, I don't care what you say. We ain't going." But let's also go down to if I can find a way quick. Is is that the word? Didn't they say they weren't going? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did they go? No, they didn't go. But then let's go to vers let's let's go start verse 14 verse 14 and verse 42. So God told them to go. They didn't go. Now they change their mind and say they want to go. Well you go and God say go. &gt;&gt; That's why the day you hear his voice harden not your heart. You know when God say you need to get right with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know he said I I remember that make no excuse. The power is here to make your son and daughter God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The power is here right now. I don't care what how many know the chain breaker is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of addiction you got. What kind of habit you got?

Amen. &gt;&gt; Read this and we wait one more clos. Amen. So verse 14 and 42 says and I say and it's not verse 41 say Moses Mo Moses said wherever do not transgress the commandments of the Lord but it shall not prosper and go not up for the Lord is not among you that you may be smitten among your enemies for the Amalites and the Canaanites are before you and you shall fall by the sword before fall by the sword because they return because you are turned away from what the Lord this good whenever you reject God's word you are turned away from hard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A believer believes all of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong. A lot of things in the Bible I do not understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of things in the message I do not understand. But he asked me to understand it. He asked me to believe it. Amen. One thing I do do, I do believe. Amen. Cuz I am a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ain't got to break it down, figure it out, believe trust in God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse four, uh four says, it say, read verse 43 again. I'll read one more part. Because you have turned away from the Lord, therefore the Lord will not what be with you. Wherever you go this morning, saints, wherever you go, you might take God with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all just I'm just a different kind of preacher. Don't leave home without a Mastercard.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't leave home without the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you need him every hour, every second, every day of the life of your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Bible says, "But the Lord, therefore the Lord will not be with you." But here, but but they pursue to go up unto the hilltop. But what the word what the Bible says nevertheless. Now God the very same thing that they done to him he's doing to them. &gt;&gt; He said nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord which is the word of God and Moses what departed not out of the camp. &gt;&gt; It didn't move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz what you when God say move that's where you move. &gt;&gt; You don't remember you don't lead God. God lead you. Amen. Remember you are sheep. &gt;&gt; Am I close right now? You a sheep. Sheep must be what? &gt;&gt; Sheep don't fight back. &gt;&gt; Goats fight back. &gt;&gt; Always.

But as far as you in my house, I am your Holy Ghost. And that's why you can't wear pants. But a sheep don't fight back. &gt;&gt; Do you know when a sheep go to get get their wool cut? Do you know when a sheep go get that wool to be sheared? They do not fight back. &gt;&gt; They lay down and let the shear or she all their wool off. Mad bad. But try to do that to a goat. My main point is I'm saying this. You want God to lead you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of people in they you look at people why my life messed up. Nobody life messed up cuz you you leading your own self. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I say lean not to your own understanding. &gt;&gt; In all your ways of knowledge. He want you what?

Say I got a right to be called my mama called me James and now call me Jasmine. That's my right. &gt;&gt; That's the age we live in &gt;&gt; where people have their own rights. &gt;&gt; But we just like Christ. We don't want our own rights. We want God's rights. &gt;&gt; Not my will, but thy will be done. Lord, Amen. &gt;&gt; For you to really go somewhere with God, high God, you must deny yourself &gt;&gt; every single day. &gt;&gt; When a preacher come and preach something you don't like, remember God, remember that God is not here to hurt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is here to help you.
