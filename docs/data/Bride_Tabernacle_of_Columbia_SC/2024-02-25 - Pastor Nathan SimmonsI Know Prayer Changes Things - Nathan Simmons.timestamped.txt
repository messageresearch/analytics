[45:46] love but we not going to hold you long
[45:50] this morning we turn to the book of
[45:53] Isaiah the 38th chapter
[45:57] something that we all should know I know
[46:01] prayer change
[46:03] things I wouldn't be here this
[46:07] morning if someone didn't pray for
[46:12] me Jesus told Peter I prayed for you
[46:15] that your faith don't fail Satan desire
[46:18] to sip your week and Hezekiah I mean
[46:23] Isaiah 38 And1 and though days Hezekiah
[46:26] was sicken to
[46:28] death and is there the prophet son of
[46:31] amamos came unto him and
[46:34] said unto him thus said the Lord set thy
[46:39] house in order for thou shall die and
[46:44] not live you may be
[46:46] seated then
[46:48] Hezekiah turned his face toward the
[46:52] wall and prayed unto the Lord how many
[46:56] know you got to
[46:58] pray and
[47:00] said remember now oh Lord I besee Thee
[47:06] how I have walked before
[47:09] thee in falsehood he say in truth and
[47:14] with a perfect heart and have done that
[47:17] which is good in thy sight and
[47:23] Hezekiah we so
[47:26] then came the word of the Lord to isael
[47:29] saying go and say to
[47:32] Hezekiah thus said the Lord the god of
[47:36] David thy
[47:39] father I've heard thy prayer I'll sing

[1:07:54] little but I thank God for him amen
[1:07:57] prayer changed
[1:08:00] things we got to pray more telling
[1:08:05] the Sunday school this morning about
[1:08:09] your
[1:08:11] testimony I
[1:08:13] said what's the number one thing in
[1:08:16] winning
[1:08:18] souls and I asked the question how many
[1:08:20] Souls have you w to the
[1:08:22] Lord
[1:08:25] how can you look back and said I've won
[1:08:28] how many Souls you I I wouldn't even try
[1:08:32] to count the number
[1:08:34] myself but if each and every one of us
[1:08:38] would be interesed in winning souls to
[1:08:41] Jesus Christ and I said
[1:08:43] how do you know how to win a soul what
[1:08:46] do you think the number one thing and
[1:08:49] winning souls to
[1:08:52] Christ and every everybody had number
[1:08:55] one
[1:08:56] right and um they were right on
[1:09:00] it so life you
[1:09:05] live
[1:09:08] and then uh sister Chapel she was
[1:09:14] telling in a roundabout way and all
[1:09:17] through about number
[1:09:19] two and she said people will look at
[1:09:22] your life
[1:09:25] then she told number
[1:09:26] two and telling number two I said sister
[1:09:30] you got it all right but I want it in
[1:09:31] one
[1:09:33] word how do you witness how do you win a
[1:09:36] soul and she told us how exactly the
[1:09:39] answer I said I'm going in one
[1:09:42] word and I think brother G answered
[1:09:47] it you
[1:09:49] see that's the one word he said your
[1:09:52] testimony
[1:09:54] if you ever been saved you got a
[1:09:57] what got a
[1:09:59] testimony now if you ain't saved you
[1:10:01] ain't got nothing to say to nobody you
[1:10:04] ain't even G to witness to nobody
[1:10:06] because you ain't saved
[1:10:10] yourself and if you ain't certain about
[1:10:12] your salvation you ain't telling nobody
[1:10:14] else to come on serve the Lord like
[1:10:17] me now if you trying to get somebody to
[1:10:20] church then that's another
[1:10:22] thing see I think we're more interested
[1:10:25] in getting somebody to come to church
[1:10:27] than we're interested in somebody coming
[1:10:28] to Christ because if you get them to
[1:10:30] Christ they don't have to come to this
[1:10:32] church but they have to come to the Lord
[1:10:35] are you with me see you got to you know
[1:10:39] because you can get somebody here they
[1:10:40] don't belong here you know they might be
[1:10:44] more suited to be somewhere
[1:10:46] else but if you get them to Christ
[1:10:48] Christ will lead them where to go are
[1:10:52] you with me so by the grace of
[1:10:55] God uh it's very
[1:10:58] important the Bible said after the Holy
[1:11:01] Ghost come upon you you should
[1:11:03] be the first thing you're going to be is
[1:11:05] a
[1:11:08] witness I had a young couple talk about
[1:11:11] getting married I said my married
[1:11:13] counselor number one married counselor
[1:11:15] if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you
[1:11:16] don't need to get
[1:11:20] married because I doubt your marriage
[1:11:22] going to work
[1:11:25] that's number one that's the first thing
[1:11:27] I ain't got to counsel you on that get
