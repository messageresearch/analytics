[40:53] and shall be joined jesus
[40:56] shall be one flesh
[40:58] this is a great mystery but i speak
[41:00] concerning christ in the church together
[41:03] nevertheless let every one of you in
[41:05] particular and so love his wife even as
[41:08] himself and why i see that she reverence
[41:12] her husband may god bless the readers
[41:14] towards you may be seated
[41:16] so by the grace of god that we want to
[41:19] talk to you tonight i mean this morning
[41:22] conquer yourself
[41:25] as a continuation from last week
[41:28] um humble yourself
[41:30] and hopefully you'll see that we'll just
[41:33] continue that same subject but the
[41:36] subject this morning is conquering yours
[41:39] to conquer yourself
[41:41] amen
[41:42] praise god
[41:44] and
[41:45] how can i
[41:47] conquer myself
[41:49] how can we conquer oneself
[41:52] to conquer oneself is to submit
[41:54] yourselves to christ
[41:57] are you with me
[41:58] to conquer yourself is to submit
[42:01] yourself to christ
[42:03] and that's why we're already fijian
[42:04] there to conquer yourself is to submit
[42:07] yourself to christ amen
[42:10] and to humble yourself before him
[42:13] that's really
[42:15] power
[42:17] amen if you want power that's where the
[42:19] power lies
[42:21] with humility and humbling in yourself
[42:25] so if you want real power
[42:27] the real power comes in humbling
[42:30] yourself
[42:32] it's humility amen
[42:35] so we'll go back to peter just a
[42:37] reminder of what we read last
[42:40] sunday first period of five and five
[42:43] it says likewise you're younger
[42:46] we're talking about
[42:48] conquering yourself
[42:51] you know some people let self conquer
[42:54] them instead of conquering themselves
[42:57] sometimes we're conquered by ourselves
[43:00] are you with me
[43:03] so
[43:03] instead of letting self
[43:05] conquer you you conquered yourself
[43:09] are you with me
[43:11] see because
[43:14] as we were at the spirit of uh
[43:16] of the last days is the spirit of
[43:18] lucifer
[43:21] where it won't set glory
[43:23] but in we're not going to allow flesh to
[43:26] get glory
[43:27] we're not going to allow self to be
[43:29] glorified or magnified in god's house
[43:33] satan wanted lucifer wanted to exalt
[43:35] himself isn't that right
[43:37] so we uh we are opposite we're going to
[43:40] conquer
[43:41] he wants to exalt himself and exalt
[43:43] himself above the stars of god isn't
[43:45] that right
[43:46] so
[43:48] as we learned last week how lucifer
[43:50] wanted to exalt himself he meant so amen
[43:53] this flesh won't exalt itself
[43:56] the flesh amen wants to lift itself up
[43:59] and think with something in our flesh
[44:02] amen the your flesh uh uh uh are trying
[44:06] to rule you
[44:08] it'll it'll try to
[44:10] conquer you
[44:12] amen but you you got to deny this flesh
[44:16] you got to deny yourself are you up man
[44:19] you in order to conquer yourself you got
[44:22] to deny it
[44:24] amen
[44:25] when your flesh says i'm weak
[44:28] i mean i'm strong
[44:30] you got to realize
[44:33] it's not by my might not by my power but
[44:35] it's by the spirit of the lord
[44:38] without jesus i can do nothing
[44:40] without him i can do nothing
[44:42] so you got to you got to learn how to
[44:44] defeat yourself
[44:46] you got to learn how to wrestle against
[44:49] his flesh
[44:50] amen fight against his flesh the bible
[44:53] says we wrestle not against flesh and
[44:54] blood but it's a spirit behind the flesh
[44:58] that we're rising against that's the
[45:00] spirit of lucifer that's the spirit amen
[45:03] they're trying to bring you bring this
[45:05] body into subjection to that spirit he
[45:08] meant the walls against god
[45:11] for paul said when i desire to do good
[45:13] evil is present with me
[45:15] amen i find then a wall going on in my
[45:18] mind
[45:19] i want to do right but there is that my
[45:22] that war that's going on
[45:25] amen
[45:26] so
[45:27] we got to realize that
[45:29] that as a wall it's it's a spirit behind
[45:32] your flesh
[45:34] amen that that you got to wrestle
[45:36] against
[45:38] it's it's it's a demon power that's
[45:41] trying to influence you to trust in
[45:44] yourself
[45:45] and to trust in your flesh
[45:48] amen and to lift your flesh up
[45:51] amen instead of seeing the spirit behind
[45:54] you see yourself but you don't see that
[45:56] there's a spirit that's taking control
[45:58] to exalt you amen
[46:02] are you with me to lift you up because
[46:04] he knows if amen if you if
[46:07] he gets you to look at yourself and lift
[46:10] yourself up
[46:12] praise god he got he conquers you
[46:15] that spirit becomes your god and that
[46:18] spirit becomes amen your headship
[46:22] that spirit becomes your husband you
[46:24] become married to a spirit amen instead
[46:28] of resisting
[46:30] amen the devil you actually submit
[46:33] yourself to the devil
[46:35] and you instead of doing the will of god
[46:37] you're doing the will of the spirit that
[46:40] conquers you
[46:42] and that is a
[46:43] spirit amen that walls against god
[46:47] amen
[46:48] we don't amen
[46:51] we don't want that spirit amen of this
[46:54] flesh to conquer you so you got to
[46:56] conquer oneself
[46:59] you got to conquer yourselves
[47:02] are you with me so just to remind you of
[47:05] last week we coming mike i was excited
[47:09] and stirred and
[47:11] they're mullings on thursday we'll be
[47:14] coming back here this morning five
[47:17] and five likewise you're young
[47:20] what i said how can i conquer myself
[47:24] okay
[47:25] by submitting yours
[47:27] to christ are you with me
[47:30] and you know christ is the
[47:32] word
[47:34] so you got to admit to christ and he is
[47:37] the word isn't that right
[47:39] so submit yourself to the word of god
[47:42] are you with me
[47:43] because you know
[47:45] why submit yourself to your what
[47:48] not to somebody else's husband to your
[47:50] what
[47:51] so each and every one of us should be
[47:54] married to christ
[47:56] are you with me
[47:58] and jesus christ is the word
[48:01] but the bible says in the beginning was
[48:02] the word the word was with god and the
[48:04] word was god and the word was made flesh
[48:06] and that was jesus christ isn't it right
[48:09] so you want to christ is the head of the
[48:12] church and you submit yourself to your
[48:14] own
[48:15] husband
[48:17] you being the bride of jesus christ and
[48:19] the wife of jesus christ submit yourself
[48:22] to your what
[48:24] your own husband
[48:26] and he is the word amen
[48:29] so submit yourself amen
[48:32] to christ who is the word are you up
[48:35] there i hope you're with me
[48:38] amen because
[48:40] it's very important that we understand
[48:43] submission and subjection amen because
[48:46] you got to do it not by constraints but
[48:48] willingly
[48:50] not because somebody making you do it
[48:53] amen not because christ is demanding you
[48:56] to do it amen because it's got to be a
[49:00] willingness
[49:01] oh uh you know
[49:03] it it's it's difficult to be married
[49:05] with somebody who's going to demand you
[49:08] that means you in prison
[49:10] and somebody that's making you amen
[49:13] marriage should be a union even a love
[49:16] affair
[49:17] or you will not i i i i i i i am your
[49:21] head and you do what i say because i
[49:24] shall rule over you
[49:26] christ ruling amen is by your submission
[49:31] are you with me his ruling the church is
[49:35] not by amen force amen
[49:38] and not by demand but by your submission
[49:43] your willingness to submit
[49:46] and to humble what
[49:48] yes you got to conquer yourself
[49:52] or you will be
[49:53] and
[49:55] and let him have had ship over the body
[49:58] which is the church
[50:01] because christ is the head of the church
[50:03] the body
[50:04] are you what man
[50:08] so he says likewise ye
[50:10] younger amen submit yourselves
[50:14] to the what
[50:15] we went over that last week but i'm
[50:17] going to read it anyway yay all of you
[50:19] be what
[50:23] and and
[50:24] and that should be a flow within the
[50:26] body of christ that we're knitted
[50:28] together in love
[50:30] and that means we're all subject one to
[50:32] another
[50:34] amen and not not somebody that's i'm way
[50:36] up here and you went on we're subject
[50:38] one to another we are one in christ
[50:40] by one spirit are we baptized into one
[50:43] body
[50:44] praise god
[50:45] the hand ought to not say because uh i i
[50:48] i'm not the defeat i have no need of you
[50:51] we have need one of another amen
[50:55] the body is one member
[50:58] are you with me
[51:01] many members in one body excuse me
[51:04] okay
[51:05] we're one
[51:06] okay says all of you be serving one to
[51:09] another
[51:10] and be clothed with what
[51:13] that's what i'm saying he says
[51:15] to be closed with humility
[51:18] and and in revelation and when we talked
[51:20] about he said uh i consider you to buy
[51:24] me gold tried in the fire amen
[51:28] and then he says i want you to
[51:31] uh
[51:32] be clothed that the shame of your
[51:33] nakedness does not appear amen
[51:36] so he he says be closed with what
[51:40] if it's ever been a time when people are
[51:42] not humble
[51:44] it's our day and i said god spoke to me
[51:46] concerning you know i need to
[51:48] improvement i need to be more humble
[51:51] are you with me
[51:52] and i think we all can
[51:54] use some improvement some more humility
[51:57] being more humble in amen trying to
[52:00] understand one another trying to amen uh
[52:03] work together in love and amen be more
[52:06] submissive one to another amen
[52:09] be more willing to uh you know
[52:12] in other words even when somebody do you
[52:15] wrong you you still love them you you
[52:18] humble yourself you forgive them amen
[52:21] that's uh that's all in love amen
[52:23] humility
[52:26] not
[52:27] trying to get back
[52:29] for god what
[52:32] resistance the problem give it grace to
[52:34] the what
[52:36] humble yourselves therefore under the
[52:38] what
[52:39] mighty hand of god that he may what
[52:43] exalt you in due time you know
[52:47] god wants to lift you up amen
[52:50] the devil wants to
[52:52] oh lord
[52:53] he says
[52:54] cast all your what
[52:57] for he
[52:58] what don't let any devil talk you out of
[53:02] this
[53:03] god wants you to cast everything every
[53:06] carriage you got upon him because he was
[53:10] now the devil will lie to you and tell
[53:11] you that god don't care about you
[53:14] the bible says i mean what god's just
[53:17] saying here he cares for you
[53:20] but in order for you to receive amen god
[53:23] amen caring for you you're gonna have to
[53:27] what
[53:28] humble yourself you've got to conquer
[53:30] itself but you got to get rid of your
[53:32] own thoughts and ideas about it
[53:36] and you got to accept what god says
[53:38] about it
[53:40] praise god to listen to god's word and
[53:42] submit to that word amen it means that i
[53:46] got to look at my pride and look at what
[53:49] i'm exalting over the word even if i'm
[53:53] if i want what god don't want me to have
[53:56] if i'm trying to amen in my imaginations
[53:59] of what i want amen and and
[54:03] and then we want god's mercy and god's
[54:05] grace on our lives we want god the
[54:07] blessings on our lives we want things to
[54:10] get better
[54:11] amen and we want the best of life amen

[54:20] you know amen we got to amen be willing
[54:23] amen to let's deny oneself amen and and

[54:57] and likewise we ought to seek to please
[54:59] christ and not ourselves
[55:02] are you a man
[55:03] but we got to conquer oneself by
[55:06] reversing it
[55:08] amen to stop the things that we give to
[55:10] the flesh we need to be amen giving it
[55:13] to god amen
[55:15] praise god we want to get we want to

[55:34] let you rule over me
[55:36] amen the bible said all that is in the
[55:38] world is the lust of the flesh the lust

[56:51] adversary the devil is the wrong line
[56:54] walking about seeking to him he may

[58:06] to go to heaven because he's been cast
[58:08] out

[59:11] decisions that we made
[59:13] amen we desire to do the right thing but
[59:16] sometimes evil was present with us and
[59:18] we yield to temptation and the bible
[59:21] told us not to yield to temptation amen
[59:27] and we went on and yielding went on
[59:30] after the things to please the flesh
[59:32] instead of pleasing god we went on after
[59:34] that and then we find out amen that the
[59:37] devil got to see man and he's devouring
[59:39] us and he's amen really amen praise god
[59:43] got us in a tough situation and a life

[59:54] right choices
[59:56] brother and sister it's time for us to
[59:57] turn it around

[1:00:25] he says
[1:00:28] the whole resist as a royal line seeking
[1:00:31] whom he made about whom resist steadfast
[1:00:33] in the faith knowing
[1:00:34] that the same afflictions are
[1:00:37] accomplished in your brethren that are

[1:04:18] conquering yourself
[1:04:20] you let self control you
[1:04:24] you let your evil desires
[1:04:26] that instead of submitting to christ the
[1:04:29] word
[1:04:30] you submitted to your own desires
[1:04:34] you can
[1:04:35] instead of conquering self
[1:04:37] you committed to your own desires
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:44] but there's a time that we god gives us
[1:04:46] space to repent
[1:04:48] and to come back to god
[1:04:51] in such a humble way
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:54] and when we come back to god
[1:04:57] god will take that which the devil meant
[1:04:59] for bad and he'll work it to your good
[1:05:03] god will work things out and
[1:05:05] amen he straightened out all
[1:05:07] the mess we've got our lives in the
[1:05:09] things the wrong turns that we turn but
[1:05:12] when we repent
[1:05:14] and say god i'm sorry god has
[1:05:16] straightened it back out and god give us
[1:05:18] peace and give us joy
[1:05:20] and give us amen let us
[1:05:23] he's he's he's still his hand is
[1:05:25] stretched out
[1:05:28] let me just turn from peter for a minute
[1:05:31] um you know he said after yourself in a
[1:05:33] while he makes you perfect
[1:05:35] god want to make you perfect
[1:05:37] amen but your perfection come through
[1:05:39] suffering
[1:05:41] god the captain of our salvation made

[1:05:44] so you have to go through some things
[1:05:46] brother sister don't try to bypass it
[1:05:48] just say lord if if i have to suffer
[1:05:50] some things for christ's sake let me
[1:05:52] suffer for christ and not for my own
[1:05:55] desires and doing things in my own way
[1:05:58] then i know i got to suffer for that but
[1:06:00] i want to suffer for christ
[1:06:02] because that's where you perfected me
[1:06:05] amen when people speak evil against you
[1:06:08] do you wrong get all that that's for
[1:06:09] your perfection that's when you're going
[1:06:11] through and you know you're doing right
[1:06:14] you know god is perfecting you god is
[1:06:16] bringing you closer to him
[1:06:19] you you can see christ in your life then
[1:06:21] he meant before amen somebody do your
[1:06:24] own you want to fight

[1:06:43] see that you trusting in your own
[1:06:44] ability amen you're trying to amen trust
[1:06:48] in your flesh amen but you got to
[1:06:50] conquer what those those desires that i
[1:06:53] can fight i can see you trusting in your
[1:06:55] flesh amen we don't rise against flesh
[1:06:57] and blood well we're asking against
[1:06:59] spiritual wickedness in high places it's
[1:07:02] a spirit behind what folks do amen and
[1:07:05] you're trying to look at that that
[1:07:06] individual but it's a spirit behind what
[1:07:09] they do amen so you'll you you're
[1:07:11] actually dealing with spirits amen and
[1:07:14] it's not with that flesh that you're
[1:07:16] fighting so you got to love that
[1:07:18] individual but you got to
[1:07:19] come against that spirit how do i come
[1:07:22] against that spirit how do i overcome
[1:07:24] those spirits the bible says humble
[1:07:26] yourself
[1:07:28] amen not not he didn't access that other
[1:07:31] that spirit humble itself he said humble
[1:07:34] yourself

[1:07:40] name well what humble themselves and
[1:07:43] pray and seek mama
[1:07:45] face amen and then turn from their
[1:07:47] wicked ways he said then well i what

[1:12:24] you know i caught myself
[1:12:26] i i
[1:12:28] i i i had a i said something to my wife
[1:12:31] and i said oh
[1:12:33] i will come under conviction quick
[1:12:36] because i knew i talked to the wrong
[1:12:38] tone
[1:12:39] it wasn't what i said it was the tone
[1:12:42] that i set it in and i know it hurted
[1:12:44] her
[1:12:45] because i said it in the wrong tone
[1:12:48] and it hurt me because i did it
[1:12:51] because i know i heard her it hurt me
[1:12:56] so immediately i said honey i'm sorry

[1:13:06] see what i'm saying

[1:13:19] i get you

[1:13:23] and that's what the devil does he wants
[1:13:25] us amen to hear the word and but not to
[1:13:29] operate on it
[1:13:31] oh you look man
[1:13:33] yeah he don't mind you amen listening
[1:13:36] but he don't want you to operate amen
[1:13:38] and sometimes we're so proud of
[1:13:39] ourselves to amen god can't get the
[1:13:42] glory out of amen god does great things
[1:13:45] and he uses us in great ways but we get
[1:13:47] so proud and lifted up and what god has
[1:13:49] done in our lives the things that god
[1:13:52] has afforded us and gave to us amen
[1:13:54] sometimes amen the way we treat god like
[1:13:57] god
[1:13:58] didn't give it to you you think your own
[1:14:01] hands you work for that i leave a heart
[1:14:04] for that i did this no no no god gave it
[1:14:07] to you
[1:14:08] give me every blessing everything that
[1:14:10] you have the cottage you drive the house
[1:14:12] you live in the money that you made the
[1:14:14] child that you got everything god gave
[1:14:17] it to you
[1:14:20] are you with me
[1:14:21] and i'm going to give all the glory and
[1:14:23] all the credit to god
[1:14:25] amen because if i don't aim it i'm gonna
[1:14:27] my flesh gonna conquer me
[1:14:30] amen myself i'm gonna give myself glory
[1:14:34] amen and i'm tired of this flesh winning
[1:14:37] amen it's time to let the god win amen
[1:14:42] it's time that god get all the glory out
[1:14:44] of our lives
[1:14:45] it's time for us to deny ourselves
[1:14:49] conquer this flesh
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:54] don't seek vain glory
[1:14:58] to survive the spirit of the humble
[1:15:01] and to revive the heart of the what
[1:15:05] contrite ones
[1:15:07] amen we ought to be more contrite more
[1:15:11] no willing to
[1:15:14] you know
[1:15:16] just be
[1:15:18] more willing to just submit
[1:15:20] to the word
[1:15:23] amen
[1:15:26] easily
[1:15:27] being treated
[1:15:30] amen not not so stiff and so hard to
[1:15:34] for folks to penetrate you
[1:15:37] they all it ought to be a sweet spirit a
[1:15:40] sweet humble spirit
[1:15:42] amen the people uh-uh i'm scared you
[1:15:46] know your spirit ought to be so welcome
[1:15:48] sweet it ought to be like christ that
[1:15:51] there's so much love so much sweetness
[1:15:53] around about you amen that's what we're
[1:15:56] trying to create an atlas feel love or
[1:15:58] create an atmosphere amen of the
[1:16:00] presence of god or somebody that amen
[1:16:03] has surrendered completely to god amen
[1:16:05] it's not about us it's not about our
[1:16:08] material things it's not about vain
[1:16:10] glory it's it's not about our family our
[1:16:13] children of this and that it's about
[1:16:15] christ
[1:16:17] thank god for everything he's done every
[1:16:20] blessing that he gave you
[1:16:22] and realizes god you know job said the
[1:16:25] lord give it to the lord take it away
[1:16:27] blessed be the name of the lord out of
[1:16:29] all the things that he had he said the
[1:16:30] lord gave it to me
[1:16:32] amen so and
[1:16:35] and god was able to restore all things
[1:16:37] because he was going through a test
[1:16:40] after you suffered a while
[1:16:42] see uh god was making joke perfect
[1:16:46] are you with me and god is bringing
[1:16:48] perfection in us
[1:16:51] are you with me
[1:16:52] and that's what sometimes god allows
[1:16:54] certain things to happen and look like
[1:16:56] job went through some hard times but he
[1:16:59] maintained his integrity
[1:17:01] are you with me
[1:17:02] and sometimes
[1:17:04] things happen in life he lost his wife
[1:17:06] he lost his children lost his cattle
[1:17:09] loss everything he went down his body
[1:17:11] was
[1:17:12] full of sores everything he lost his
[1:17:14] wife talking like a foolish woman and
[1:17:17] everything
[1:17:19] are you what man
[1:17:21] he had everything to turn against him
[1:17:23] but yet amen
[1:17:25] in order for god to look down and says
[1:17:28] yes
[1:17:29] have you considered my servant joe what
[1:17:32] about you
[1:17:33] can you put your name there
[1:17:35] amen and can you compare yourself with
[1:17:38] job
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:40] but sometimes we we we we think that we
[1:17:44] are job and we think almost uh and we
[1:17:47] hadn't even you know
[1:17:49] touched the surface
[1:17:50] of what it's like to go through some
[1:17:52] things they meant that job went through
[1:17:55] and some of these uh uh
[1:17:57] soldiers in the bible they meant the war
[1:18:00] that they had to face and the thing
[1:18:01] trials and tribulations that they had to
[1:18:03] go through amen we amen have not
[1:18:06] experienced you know just
[1:18:09] not even just a little bit of what they
[1:18:11] had to go through are you with me but
[1:18:13] the little that god has allowed us to go
[1:18:16] through amen we got to conquer
[1:18:21] ourselves
[1:18:23] are you with me
[1:18:25] so
[1:18:26] i got to cut it short deuteronomy uh
[1:18:29] let's go to deuteronomy 8
[1:18:33] judah
[1:18:34] romans
[1:18:35] 8.
[1:18:37] i thank god for you know this journey
[1:18:40] uh it's it's it's a journey
[1:18:44] that god is taking us on but it does not
[1:18:47] mean nothing if you can't hear it
[1:18:50] you know some people you know
[1:18:52] you know these come to church the word
[1:18:54] can't penetrate because they're not
[1:18:56] interested in it
[1:18:58] god don't have the attention you know
[1:19:00] what i'm saying because they're put off
[1:19:02] god for a future
[1:19:05] they don't want god now amen no matter
[1:19:08] what you say i'm not i i don't want god
[1:19:11] now
[1:19:12] i i when i when i need him i'll call him
[1:19:15] but i don't need him now i don't want
[1:19:17] him i i'm healthy i'm strong and i'm
[1:19:21] enjoying life and i don't need god now
[1:19:26] it's only to those you know some folks
[1:19:28] will wake up at a young age but it's not
[1:19:30] many young people that wakes up at a
[1:19:32] young age they
[1:19:34] when they wake up at a young age amen
[1:19:37] god can use him and it's such a blessing
[1:19:39] for them to wake up as young ages but
[1:19:41] many times the devil has taken our youth
[1:19:44] and he left uh he said flee youthful
[1:19:47] lusts that wars against our members but
[1:19:50] when we're young we trust in our
[1:19:52] youthfulness
[1:19:54] are you with me
[1:19:55] but god wants you to flee that
[1:19:58] and realize that you got a soul to that
[1:20:01] state
[1:20:02] young people are losing their mind young
[1:20:04] people are being killed and destroyed
[1:20:06] amen that's the time that the devil amen
[1:20:10] will amen torment you that's the time
[1:20:12] the devil will take control those are
[1:20:14] the times that you need god more than
[1:20:16] ever write down young people
[1:20:19] amen because the prophet said if you're

[1:24:58] you wouldn't have never knew that
[1:25:00] certain things lies within you that

[1:25:06] those things needed to get straightened
[1:25:07] out
[1:25:09] they had to come to the light
[1:25:12] and god was showing them what was in
[1:25:14] them
[1:25:15] but they didn't know what was in them
[1:25:17] because amen they beat the tamarind they
[1:25:20] shouted and danced they met they crossed
[1:25:22] the red sea the egyptian army got
[1:25:25] drowned in amen you know you're on your

[1:25:39] coming up but he wanted to see how you
[1:25:41] were going to respond amen to the way
[1:25:44] that he was leading you the way that he
[1:25:46] was taking you i want to see what's in

[1:26:05] heart
[1:26:06] whether i would what
[1:26:09] to keep his commandments or not
[1:26:12] god wanted to see whether you do it
[1:26:16] certain things come up here and offers
[1:26:18] and desires and all kind of
[1:26:21] battles and all but god don't see what
[1:26:23] you're going to keep his commandments or
[1:26:24] not
[1:26:26] praise god
[1:26:27] are you still going to live right are
[1:26:29] you still going to do right
[1:26:32] do you still want to serve the lord
[1:26:35] do you still love him
[1:26:38] or will you just give up and curse your
[1:26:40] god and die
[1:26:43] what what is your response what is your
[1:26:46] reaction
[1:26:47] because things did not go flow right
[1:26:53] job didn't do nothing
[1:26:54] god was just testing him
[1:26:56] but some of the stuff we go through is
[1:26:58] because of what we've done
[1:27:00] the decision we made
[1:27:03] god's just not testing us we made it we
[1:27:05] made bad decisions
[1:27:08] but are we going to be humble enough to
[1:27:09] say god forgive me
[1:27:13] and i repent
[1:27:14] and i want to do right
[1:27:17] are you with me
[1:27:18] oh we're going to say well
[1:27:21] so-and-so did it too
[1:27:23] that one did it not oh everybody do it
[1:27:26] i might as well
[1:27:28] if they did it i did so what
[1:27:33] i don't care
[1:27:34] you know
[1:27:39] the attitude that people have
[1:27:42] how they respond what's in their heart
[1:27:45] it's oh lord you brought us out here to
[1:27:47] die i thought serving the law would be
[1:27:50] uh uh joy peace and righteousness i
[1:27:53] thought it would be oh just a wonderful
[1:27:56] time i came in the church and i thought
[1:27:59] i was in my own my way to heaven oh lord
[1:28:01] it was so sweet god was so good but i
[1:28:04] find i'm on my way to heaven everybody
[1:28:07] ain't safe
[1:28:11] what about
[1:28:12] you what about you
[1:28:17] did god ever change
[1:28:20] did god ever change
[1:28:24] what did god do to you
[1:28:26] to make you start loving him
[1:28:30] oh what i
[1:28:32] see
[1:28:33] you cannot love god and hate your
[1:28:35] brother
[1:28:37] or hate your sister
[1:28:40] the minute you start looking at others
[1:28:44] instead of keeping your eyes on the lord
[1:28:47] then you lose your joy you lose
[1:28:49] everything
[1:28:51] you look at your situation your
[1:28:53] you know
[1:28:57] you can't look at situations and
[1:28:59] problems and difficulties you got to
[1:29:00] keep your eyes on how good god is
[1:29:04] your road to heaven is keeping your eyes
[1:29:06] on jesus
[1:29:08] and say lord you never fail me
[1:29:11] you never will
[1:29:13] and god you saved me

[1:31:59] your own conquer yourself amen you got
[1:32:02] the wall against his flesh are you with
[1:32:04] me
[1:32:05] so trust god no matter what comes or
[1:32:08] what goes
[1:32:09] amen i got to close here
[1:32:11] it says
[1:32:12] suffer thee the hunger and failed thee
[1:32:15] with manna
[1:32:16] which thou knewest not
[1:32:19] neither did
[1:32:20] thy father's no
[1:32:22] are you with me
[1:32:24] that he might
[1:32:26] make thee known
[1:32:28] know
[1:32:29] that man what
[1:32:32] does not live by what
[1:32:34] now jesus said that too
[1:32:37] but he says that to those children of
[1:32:39] israel as they
[1:32:41] ventured into the promised land that man
[1:32:44] does not live by bread alone
[1:32:48] but what
[1:32:50] by every word that proceeds from what
[1:32:54] and and see that's what you defeat the
[1:32:57] devil with
[1:32:59] amen eve dotted one word but the bride
[1:33:01] of the last day
[1:33:03] amen has one husband your own husband
[1:33:06] you submit yourselves to your own
[1:33:09] husband
[1:33:10] are you with me
[1:33:11] and that is christ and he is the word
[1:33:14] and submit yourself to him
[1:33:17] man does not live by bread only but by
[1:33:20] what every word that proceeded from the
[1:33:23] what
[1:33:24] mouth for god
[1:33:26] and you know what
[1:33:29] the church is supposed to be subject to
[1:33:31] christ right
[1:33:33] but you really realize that
[1:33:35] the
[1:33:36] denominational world in the church world
[1:33:38] is not subject to christ
[1:33:41] they're making the church instead of
[1:33:43] them being subject to the word they're
[1:33:45] making the word subject to them
[1:33:49] are you with me
[1:33:50] they exalt themselves over the word are
[1:33:53] you with me
[1:33:54] the church is being exalted over the
[1:33:56] word the wife is being lifted up over
[1:34:00] are you with me the woman is being the
[1:34:02] head of the man instead of man me the
[1:34:04] head of the woman
[1:34:06] are you with me
[1:34:08] that's what the church world is doing
[1:34:10] they're venturing into amen they're
[1:34:13] changing
[1:34:14] amen positions
[1:34:17] and when they change position amen they
[1:34:20] it's not humility anymore it's not
[1:34:23] submission anymore
[1:34:25] because people are changing oh you look
[1:34:27] man
[1:34:28] so when you see amen people you know you
[1:34:31] show them what the words say and they
[1:34:33] won't submit themselves to the word
[1:34:36] amen they're not submitting themselves
[1:34:38] to christ this
[1:34:39] they'll uh i i i
[1:34:42] the word say that but i don't believe
[1:34:44] that i'm not doing this i'm not doing
[1:34:47] that see they're not submitting
[1:34:48] themselves to their husband
[1:34:50] and the husband is the word are you with
[1:34:52] me
[1:34:53] and that's what's wrong that's what's
[1:34:55] wrong in the
[1:34:57] church today that's what's wrong with
[1:34:59] society today amen disrespecting the
[1:35:02] word
[1:35:04] amen and when we disrespect the word we
[1:35:07] disrespect god
[1:35:09] because he is the word
[1:35:11] and to say you love him and don't want
[1:35:14] to keep his word is to say you don't
[1:35:16] love him
[1:35:18] if you keep his word you got to humble
[1:35:21] yourself
[1:35:22] are you with me
[1:35:24] you got to conquer yourself by humming
[1:35:26] yourself
[1:35:27] amen stay
[1:35:30] stay in your lane
[1:35:31] god bless you let us stand
[1:35:36] praise god are you all right
[1:35:38] i know i didn't preach this morning but
[1:35:40] i hope i said something
[1:35:42] to help you along the way
[1:35:45] don't get out of position
[1:35:48] amen the humble is the way
[1:35:51] the way down is the way up
[1:35:54] amen he'll lift you up in due time
[1:35:57] sometimes we have to suffer a little
[1:35:59] while but be faithful to christ
[1:36:02] because he'll exalt you in due time
[1:36:05] is god all right with you
[1:36:07] amen everybody wants to go to heaven
[1:36:10] amen if you want to go it takes humility
[1:36:14] suffering
[1:36:15] humbling oneself
[1:36:17] god bless you let us bow
