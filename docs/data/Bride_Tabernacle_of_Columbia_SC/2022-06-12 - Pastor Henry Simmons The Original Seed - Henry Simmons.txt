forth today lord bless every heart bless every family every home god oh god meet every need in the name of jesus christ we pray amen hebrews 11 and 1 through 6. i'll read the first year read the next now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen to through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made by the things which do appear for by faith enough was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleads god together but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that coming to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen god bless you to which you may be seated we want to talk this morning concerning the original scene and we know that the spoken word is the original seed amen and god said let there be light and the bible says there was light amen because god said it it was praise god if you say to the mountain amen because we are coming back into spoken word what was in the original amen would come back amen to amen every seed in genesis 1 every seed must bring forth of its kind so we must bring forth the same seed amen if we deceive amen then we're going to bring forth the bible says the seed is the word isn't that right so he said the parable is the seed is the word praise god this good seed of the children of the kingdom are you with me the tares are the children of the wicked one are you with me but we're talking about the spoken word amen is the original seed the original seed amen praise god sometimes amen we have amen uh uh folks that are a c but it's not original amen it's hybrid seed as the prophet god said in the program is eight it's hybrid amen so by the grace of god we must watch amen whether or not we try to mingle and mix the seed with our own ideas our own thoughts amen so uh eve he met in the beginning amen she doubted the word and because of doubt amen it brought forth death amen in other words amen you cannot mix the word with unbelief you cannot mix amen see satan uh the serpent began to inject his own amen ad amen to the word you shall not surely die we can't add to the word we can't take away from the word the word must be pure the word stands alone by itself is right you can't make the word noble uh better than it is you can't make it no less than if the word stands alone and amen so it it it's the original you know some folks amen the one you know they call false prophets but in order to have a false you have to have a real first amen you have to have a truth before you have a false are you a man in order to have a counterfeit and made off the real are you with me so you got the original the real thing and then you got the counterfeit praise god a lot of times folks that were added to the scripture and some folks are taken away from the scriptures but the scripture must be amen the word amen must be pure you cannot tamper with it praise god it's just like they they take an orange and a lemon and look you know and they put it together amen they take certain fruits and amen and that's what has caused all the trouble amen in the world people have mixed and mangled the seeds that a mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds and and it cannot be mixed amen it's not the size of the mustard seed it's the pureness of the mustard seed it cannot be mixed are you with me so you cannot mix the mustard seed with nothing else amen praise god and now we we look at the uh the hybridization of the age that we're living in and it has caused amen are so many diseases and so many things that happen in in the bodies of folk and having an effect amen on the human life because the of the hybridization of of of people mixing amen and trying to make things better than what god made it praise god see the the devil will offer you uh something better than what god has to offer and that's what happens uh the trouble comes in when we try amen to some folk are trying to make church so much better for the young people to their catering and they're mixing the world with the church amen but we have to have the original we must come back to the original praise god because the spoken word is the original seed it must be the original church it must be the original seed and the original seed would do what god said it'll do praise god we don't have to try amen to entertain we don't have to try to fix something that amen is not broken praise god the word of god is not broken the word of god will accomplish that which god sent me to do you praise god hallelujah praise god you can't make jesus no more amen no greater god than he is and no less amen jesus stands as i am praise god it stands alone praise god and here we are go to um saint john 15. the original seed you know i i look at sometimes in the the mule the mule amen they got they they they took the dunking and the horse and they breaded it amen and they made a mule a mule could be a hard worker but he shows stuff and ain't it and you know when you see folk in the church that's so stubborn you know they got new religion they got their own ideas amen they just can't walk by faith and amen they got the whys and what kind why i got to do it this way and and they can kind of question god amen god is god you don't have to question god if god said it i believe it and that sells it amen but some folk want to know why why i got to do it this way why i got to do it that way if the word they said it they meant we live by amen we walk by faith not by sight and man should not live by what read alone but by every word to proceed out of the mouth of god if god's word said it amen you don't have to see it or understand it you just believe what god said god you said it that's your word amen well i don't understand it god didn't say understanding he said believe believe it or not the bible is right somebody's wrong amen the bible said it that's where we go with the bible what god said amen the people of god want god to explain to the carnal mind amen the bible said except a man be born again he cannot understand he cannot see the kingdom of god how can we understand oh i'm talking about the original sea amen it takes the holy ghost to come down amen identify seed amen because the holy ghost amen seeks you out amen no amen you didn't seek god god sought you god said where are you adam amen god find adam amen adam was hiding from god but god found him he said you've not chosen me but i've chosen you and i gained you amen i'm saying god saw you amen and god came with the word and he found you the voice of god come walking in the cool of the evening and god found you i'm so glad that god found me i couldn't find god because i wasn't looking for him it's not in man to seek god god seeks man amen praise god but he said well how come he says seek and you shall find knock on the door shall be opened it's because amen god gives you the ability amen because god put that there for you to thirst after him praise god if something comes in that original seed amen because they know it's something a deep calling to the deed but god has to put that there now uh saint john 15 is something about man wants to do something of his own accord of his own self amen and have something to do with god playing a salvation salvation is of the lord amen is not of works at least any man shall boast it is the gift of god god saves us by his own sovereign grace amen there's nothing that we could do nothing that we could achieve or attain amen to get amen to god amen to be a son or daughter god that's what you were amen in god before the foundation of the world amen because god's phone knew you god predestinated you amen to adoption of children god saw you there amen and because he saw you there amen oh god you didn't have to do anything amen god did it for you praise god god thought about you amen and because he thought about you amen it was god amen amen calling you by sovereign grace come unto me amen all you believer amen as i was in prayer i said lord god amen and something came in my spirit it's time to for the children to return back home it's time for those that went away from the lord it's time to come on back home it's time amen to seek the lord while he may be found call upon him while he's near this time amen that folks ain't mad stop lingering out there amen god is calling amen his children back to himself they meant something about i said amen we just got to pray with strong cries amen god bring your children back home god we need amen the power of god let's reach out there and those that are taken captive by the devil amen we need somebody that's going to cry out to god amen my heart is truly splinterful but the name was a few we praying ye to the lord of the harvest that you'll send levels into the vineyard god call him home hey come home come home brother sister come back to god hallelujah oh yes there is a time to return amen god is calling people to return back to god come back home come back to the word amen come back to your homeland come back to where oh hallelujah oh where the eagle food is where the caucus is that where the eagles will be gathered praise god you don't you're not a chicken ain't that praise god you're not amen of this world amen you come from god you're going back to god amen i'm not of this world ain't meant the world can't please her they meant the world love is owned ain't that the world don't love the children of god you can wander out there amen but there's no place you can find rest amen praise god because you amen are not of this world praise god god calls his children back to the eagle the caucus where the fresh manner is where the blood is amen where the life is god calls his children back to the original word back to the original seed back to amen uh uh a bible salvation not amen a man-made creed a dogma some denomination but god calls you back to the word of god god calling his people out of mystery babylon back to the word back to the original back to the original praise god hallelujah something about highly you know amen when the ego screams amen how do you know who that is praise god a ducky man i mean mew don't know who the mom is don't know who the daddy is they just all mixed up praise god but you're uh a thoroughbred praise god hallelujah you are of the original they admit the mule is not original seed amen but it's a mix it's a hybrid and out there in the denomination of the world they mix their creeds and dogmas with the word amen it brings forth mules heart they can outwork you they may praise god but they cannot live the life they meant the life that is in the word they cannot reproduce the word eve was to reproduce adam are you with me the purpose of the wife was to reproduce the husband amen praise god children of the sons and daughters of god are you with me but instead of that she doubted the word and what came forth cain and evil amen isn't that right praise god and look what happened king was of the wicked one are you with me so what is it going on brother and sister amen praise god the church he meant that mitch's creeds and gone with the word shall bring full muse are you up man but we want the original amen a room a mule is stubborn a mule is rebellious amen or mew you got to tell them amen praise god and they'll kick you amen you try to get them to do what's right they'll kick you you remember saul of tasha the amen he had to get a nature chain because he said it hard to kick against the prick oh you're with me because paul was kicking he was kicking against the word amen but god got him straightened out he didn't have no more kick in him praise god he was able to humble himself praise god himself who are you lord the lord said i'm jesus praise god somebody needs to wake up find out that jesus christ is the word and he's the original seed amen praise god they don't know who jesus is they don't know who their father is they don't know who their mother is they're just a meal amen my sheep know my voice and it's strange that they will not follow god people amen understand amen that amen god has called us on a third exodus god has called us out of the world come out from among them and be separate amen but you want to bring the world into church people want to look like the world act like the world live like the world and they bring it in the church and they want to worship god and they want to worship him in spirit and truth you can't do that brother sister praise god you can't come into church with a miniskirt on and try to shout and dance in the spirit amen you need to get straightened out brother you can't come amen with a nappy head oh lord have mercy uh come on somebody you're coming to see jesus god i i want to come in your house and i want to honor you i don't want to come like i'm going to a bald game i'm coming to hear god i'm coming for before great king i'm coming to washington him oh let's come to the house of the lord like god is in our mission we're giving honor and respect and reverence to him are you up there let's look like real children of god let's not try to look like the world act like the world dressed like the world amen we come to worship god amen and you know yo your flesh don't like it because you want to be cool you want to be like the world amen but we want to be like jesus somebody go hungry if somebody want to be a christian if somebody want to love god and somebody want to give him their all that somebody want to live right that somebody want praise god you know you have trouble with trying to convince him you ain't meant that it it his father is a horse trying to commit some new amen and i'm gonna tell you something brother and sister it won't work i don't care how much you do to try to satisfy a mule a mule in his nature gonna remain a mule are you up man you cannot amen get it he meant to act right for nothing and you cannot get them to live right for nothing oh well you got to show them love you can show everything you want until that nature is changing ain't going nothing gonna do except with born again until the holy ghost come you can fuss you can fight you can beat them over the head you can try to make them it won't work you see they gonna take it what the muse what what all you want next thing you know the mule might take a step or two next thing you know the mule kicking again starving again going right back in that same shape but it's strong when it's going it's going and when it's walking it's walking praise god but at the same time it cannot reproduce itself are you with me let every seed bring forth of its kind and if it's not of the original seed it cannot reproduce you take a hybrid coin they say it can look so much like the corn even in the uh even in the microscope and everything you put it up under there and it looks like the original coin ain't no way you can find out except it go in the ground and die and rotten it if it's like if it's not original it cannot reproduce itself or you would be but if it's original you can see corn come up again but if it's hybrid corn no way you can find it out amen scientific it's got to die got to go in the ground and until you die praise god until you die to yourself praise god that determines what are you original or not praise god except a corner wheat fall in the ground and die it abides alone praise god hallelujah praise god the old man is crucified with christ that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin i said we got to die out to ourselves amen we got the surrender total surrender to god what's the matter with the church today what's the matter with folks today they don't want a total surrender to god amen you got to separate yourself from all unbelief you got to be willing to know that god is a god that cares about you god is the god that can help you god is a god that can bless you yes he is i know god is god and he don't never change praise god god wants to bless his people but what happened amen people want to drew halfway right and want to go partially amen they're looking for the wrong thing they're looking for church you're looking for friendship they're looking for somebody to pat them on the back but if you're looking for jesus he is in his own word amen christ is revealed in his own are you what man what he was he is oh god is good amen he said in 15 uh saint john 15 and 4. he said in the third verse you're clean through the words which i speak which i spoken unto you you want to get cleaned up let the word clean you up amen preacher can't clean your church can't clean you there's got to be something in your heart brother it's got to be something that you want to be a christian i want to be saved i look at the world look at people in the shape that they're in and sometimes you say oh you're picking at the people no i thank god he delivered me i feel sorry for the people that's out there bound on drugs why i don't knock out people that's in bad shape you feel sorry for you go look at the prostitute on the corner i look at the drug deal or whatever you feel sorry for him are you picking out him no do you think you're better than them no it's just by the grace of god i am what i am amen you know sometimes folks say well you you picking that in this one you're picking that down that's what's wrong with the church folk they picking at everybody amen the church folks are saved by grace and they're thankful to god that he saved them and that's what we're talking about we're talking about it from an angle that we are thanking god for what he delivered us from praise god we were lost one time too we understand what is like to be lost praise god we understand what it's like to be a sinner but we do understand what it's like to be saved are you upset with them no amen we pity them we want them to be saved we want them to come to the lord amen are you talking about them are you down in them no we care about them we love them but we love the word the best oh you would be so we got to tell them what thus said the word and because they gotta hear the word to be saved are you with me if they don't ever hear it then they got an excuse but if they hear it and they didn't don't do eve heard what the word said don't you touch it don't you either of at least you die and she disobeyed are you with me she let the devil deceive her are you with me and the devil is doing the same thing today amen he's taking you away from the original word he's checking the church world amen because they trying to do everything he meant to uh to fill up the church and to have more memories and and i don't know what they're trying to do altogether but but we understand they met the god amen got a plan his word would do what he said it'll do it never lost oh god brother and sister don't you try to get something else to pacify you in the settle nothing else would work amen remember the preaching of the gospel that's what god used to the same men they meant to preach the word amen preaching instant in season out of season preach it at the hearing and preach it up to don't hear it preach the word amen praise god he didn't tell them to go amen go out and and build a hospital to go out and build a schoolhouse go out and do this and go out and do that he said go preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be down preaching the gospel they met preachers are trying to do everything oh oh yes but he said preach the gospel and the gospel should do what god sent it to do brother and sister if you tell somebody the truth just tell them plain and simple with love in your heart tell them amen what the words say and if they don't hear the word then you've done your job you just ain't meant a christian and you love them you tell them the truth amen and they don't want to hear the truth amen it's not you that they ain't rejecting they're rejecting it wrote the word do you love him amen i'm gonna tell you something the world is in bad shape the church is in bad shape whether we believe it or not it's in bad shape it's in a pitiful condition why because we are all we're trying to be so uh you know i i you know know what person condition yes i know you should you got the love of god jesus had compassion and he loved but it didn't take away from him telling the truth the apostles had love but they told the people the truth because it was not the truth they could not be free are you with me that's why we tell people you must repent of your sin be baptized in the name of jesus christ with enriching sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost are you with me that's not another avenue another way there's only one way to be saved that's god's way that's the entrance into the church repentance be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if you don't do that then what can we do we can't give you nothing else but the word amen people can give you all kind of things amen all you got to do is accept the lord jesus christ in your heart that's right you should do that but you should also be baptized in jesus christ's name are you with me don't stop there then you also should receive the gift of the holy ghost or you have been but a lot of times folk give you so much just enough to make you think you got it all are you a man they give you enough of the truth to make you think you got it all that's all you need just a little bit of jesus you want all that god has for you and all that god has allotted for this day in this age that we live in we need all of it and the luther day in uh reformation it was the gesture live by faith that's all they had just shall live by faith amen and they have faith they can come out of catholicism amen and they could amen hold on to that which they had amen see just a few insiders amen they not defile their garments and see it's just a few this is a few in every age that god calls out he's elected it's chosen amen but there'll be many amen that gonna say lord lord then i do many wonderful works you say the children of the baron are more than the children of the married wife in other words the children that don't have it's not an illegal impaired and they meant the illegitim it's more than people that's married and in the days of noah the sons of god saw the daughters of men and that's why the young men don't want to choose the daughter of god they want to choose the daughter of the men because in the days of noah they saw the sons of god amen see they were sons of god but they saw the daughters of men and they married them wives are you a man they don't want a a a a christian a saved sister and sisters amen that's in the church and we're walking according to the word sometimes they want to get somebody out there too are you with me instead of looking at somebody who's trying to live for god they want to oh they want to hold lord hallelujah are you all right god is good god i'm gonna get there hopefully i gotta y'all you gotta fulfill scripture now and because the sons of god and what they were doing god had to come and said i gotta destroy this place are you with me he said abide in me and i in you the fourth verse as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine see brothers and sisters it no way you're going to bring forth the fruits there's no way you're going to bring forth to christian character i'm gonna talk about you go out with the world as i told them in mullins the other day you're going to smoky place and you come out somebody say you smell like marijuana you smell like cigarettes you say no i i i i i smell no cigarettes now i ain't smoking marijuana somebody said you smell like it i'm going to tell you something you you go around wrong kind of spirits evil spirits you go around devils and demons and all and you come back those demons and got on your shoulder then your feet let me tell you what what happened to me i'm sitting in the barbie shop and they had the music on and i'm just patting my feet little fella in that shiny shoes he said ram ram look at you you find your feet it got in me ain't it it got to me i didn't even know i patting my feet i was patting my feet because i'm into what i'm in the barber shop and they playing that music and i'm patting my feet don't even know i'm patting my feet he knew i wasn't supposed to be patting my feet because he knew that was the wrong kind of music i was patting my feet to but our show was patting my feet i'ma tell you so you can go in a place and come out and thinking that oh no ain't it ain't got no i don't smoke i don't i don't drink you hanging out the bible said evil communication what amen can two walk together except they what great and that's what it is amen you got to recognize that the word trying to save you're trying to keep you but amen we want to you know we want the friendship of the world because if we have friends of the world that we clinging on to amen then your enemy to god amen you say well uh brother and sister i'm gonna tell you something sometimes you have to you have to give up friendship but we don't want to do that people talk about brothers talk about sister talk about the pastor talk about the church and you go fellowship with a lot of us you know what happens you can't say amen because the spirit doesn't got on you those on them well i don't believe what they believe yes you do can two walk the step together they be in agreement you think you ain't believing what they believe i'ma tell you something if you got a different spirit than another person that person don't want to be around you you ain't got to worry about you separating yourself from them they'll separate themselves from you you how many of you when you got saved your friend left you you tried to talk to them about the lord i i shall come to see you sister but i i i i i i i i i i you know sometimes they scope when you're out sometimes they're checking you out and see whether or not you still got what you got and then and then you start talking and you know i i i i you know i got a point that since time you know i gotta go why because they're checking you out seeing that you lost your religion whether or not you've lost what you had people ain't gonna stay around you amen if a complainer is around you you will become a complainer if a daughter is around you you become a daughter or you'll win them or they'll win you are you what man those spirits you're talking about my sister betty was telling me about some spirits got on me and i said you're right shows is so right and you're thinking oh the

and amen but this is this you're not taking away their salvation but god called you to a deeper walk god called you to a higher calling amen they they all right where they are but you got to understand that they they're not what you are and god may not even require them to be that somebody said that you know the psalm was a penny someone nickeled him or died it meant you you might some 56

you'll find yourself drifting drifting amen and sister we just got to shine the very appearance of evil we just got to resist the devil and he'll flee from you let's just go to our corinthians here uh on six and then i i got a couple of scriptures then i it's something about uh knowing who your father is and you know when the bride recognizes she who she is then the rapture takes place you know you got to recognize that you're the bride of jesus christ and you're the lamb's wife out of all this amen realize that there were uh 10 virgins five or wise father foolish you're the wise and you gotta you know because you're wise you gotta conduct your life different from the foolish yes they got all and you got all but you know one day they're all gonna run out are you up man but you gotta have extra oil you gotta have a look more than they got are you with me because you know you're going to need more at that time a need when the bridegroom coming amen they're going to recognize they don't have what it takes to make the rapture are you with me but you gonna have to be sure that you got not only what the oil in your lamp but all in your vessel are you up man that means you got extra but you don't have enough to get somebody else this is the individual thing amen when they ask for some of your oil you said not so i can't give it to you you got to go by for yourself individual walk brother sister uh first corinthians 6 here and 14. legends 15 it says know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ are you with me it says shall shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of a what holler now in revelation hold your hand there in revelation 17 and 5 when it talks about mystery babylon it says and upon her forehead was the name written mystery babylon the great the mother of what holla is an abomination of what the earth isn't that right it y'all got it let me let me do it again revelation 17 and 5. hold your hand on corinthians and upon her forehead was the name written mystery what the great the mother what and abomination of the earth and then in revelation 18 it says uh talk about babylon has fallen and become the habitation of devils the whole of every foul spirit caterpillar and clean hate for bird and all nations are drunk with around the wrath of fornication isn't that right the fourth verse said and i heard another voice from heaven saying come what come out of her who now i'm telling you there's a place called babylon that is a place where the harlot is and you can't join yourself to a holland and expect amen unfaithful a harlot amen praise god let's go back to corinthians okay he says know you're not that your body is the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of a what harlem you got you better be careful who you who you messing around with see sometimes we want to make people say we want to make people the bride we want to make people the word amen you can't make a person the word if they're not the word they'll never be the word amen praise god if god god chose you oh i believe that god uh no i are we all sympathetic with everybody all of us sympathetic no not i don't believe it's a one christian that got the love of god in their heart would want anybody to be lost are you with me but we know that folks are going to be lost because folks are going to turn down the word that is not for us to judge them god's going to judge him but but i would say but we know you not that the saints going to judge the world are you with me so we come back what we're going to judge and what the word because you told them the truth one day amen that god will play back the recording and they would see you right there you don't have to even open your mouth your your life the way you live the way you dress the way you stood for christ amen all they have to do is see you because god when they saw you that light was shining and you don't have to say i'm going to judge the world and i'm going to send us you you're on when god played back the recording that record ain't going to say now what did you hear when you saw them yeah that's a true christian you ought to give your life to christ you didn't even have to open your mouth to him they just saw you and knew that and they didn't do it are you with me i'm gonna tell you something one day it's gonna echo down inside a man okay i gotta i'm let me read the next verse what the 16th verse it says what know you're not that he which is john to a holler is what one body for the two says he shall be what but he that is joined unto the lord is what one spirit the bible said by one spirit are we baptized into what one body talking about jesus christ isn't that right and the body is the body the church is his body isn't that right and the church is the body of christ and by one spirit we're baptized into his body are you will be so so by the grace of god um don't join yourself with the world and the things of this world and thinking oh i know who i am i i know uh-uh it could be your mama it could be your daddy sister your brother your husband your wife your children whatever don't no don't go alone with them when they coming against the word the bible truth that you see and understand and know you stay with the word praise god it's not worth your soul amen to get off the word to join yourself to somebody that's off the word praise god many people left the words because it just they can do what they want to do and get to heaven the broad way lead it to destruction they ain't getting away this is some things i wanted to bring out but maybe i'll just cut off what i was seeing brother and sister i was saying that people joined themselves to spirits and people are not faithful to god because they're handing soul out if you're not sold out in your spirit to love the word don't fall in love with brother simmons oh i just love brother simon no no no no you want you to fall in love with jesus christ oh i love brother branham jesus christ fall in love with jesus christ we can give respect and honor thank god for him but you fall in love with jesus christ he's going to espouse you to one husband even christ isn't that right see that's what's wrong we oh that's my friend not my buddy sometimes when it comes down to the words you stay with the word mama daddy sister brother stay with the word praise god if anything that not exalting jesus christ and not exalting this bible amen you stay with the word if the message of god sent in this hour did anything has brought us back to jesus christ and he is the word are you with me so when we come out of mr battle we ain't coming to no denomination coming to know this and that we're just coming back to the bible amen why well we had it all the time everybody had it all the time but look what they added to it are you with me folk added to the bible added listen out of that and it ain't even scripture oh you look man so man should not live by bread alone but by what that's that's what we come down to and brother and sister we got to preach it that way we got to teach it that way and we got to live it are you with me it's not no compromising amen you don't want to compromise with your eternal destination if you want to make it in you don't want to compromise with nobody you love the people and you love the center you love god is not saying nothing about those people and the nomination it's the system i used to hear bishop watching all the time say about his mom he said the train you on the train and the train going in a certain direction and you on that train and that train go you're going with it it's it's a system now that's why god called us out because we know the system where it's headed upon this rock he said i'll build my church then the gates of hell shall not prevail against it are you with me so the church blown to jesus christ and it's his church it don't belong to no organization no group of men no bishop no no denomination the church blown to jesus christ and he is the word praise god and that's what we got to respect brother amen it's not peter not paul not cephalus not a polos it's the jesus christ amen he's the one that died he's the one to save us amen praise god thank god for isaiah thank god for abraham thank god for jacob but jesus said before abraham was i am praise god i thank god for all of them but jesus praise god is the one that we look into amen he's the savior he's the deliverer he's the healer he's the one praise god wait a minute we turn back to jesus christ because he's the wire amen and that's what it like a lot of people get off praise god so brother samuel have you ever got off yeah i've got off before amen and i don't know too many people that hadn't are you with me but god calling us back back to the word are you with me back to the word back to jesus christ back to the holy ghost baptism back to the fire back to the power back to the same jesus amen let's get back to jesus he's the word amen god bless you let us stand amen praise god let's lift jesus up let's take it let's let the word ankle deep down in our soul let's let something happen in our lives that will cause an uh uh have effect on the way we live the way we love one another the way we care about one another let's let the word have a deeper meaning as you look out at folks that are maybe walking in arrow but they don't know it why get upset with them people don't know no better but you know amen try to guide them with love and kindness praise god try to try to show them the way that you care about their soul you love them praise god don't try to condemn them but try to just show compassion towards them we love you brother sister let me show you this let me show you that it's only be in love if then if they they can't take it right then maybe you just have to wait maybe somebody else is going to do it it's not your job amen your job is just to pray for them because they're not going to hear you are you with me everybody and then there may be somebody else come by and they hear them and they say this is what you've been trying to tell me but i see it now so many times that had happened we witnessed to somebody and they didn't receive us but somebody else come by they received them that's the purpose of the five-fold ministry praise god the pastor can't show you but sometimes the god has sent somebody else and you see it are you with me let us bow father in name of jesus christ we thank you thank you for this hour of deliverance for the original seed the spoken word is the original seed it's not that you sent a prophet to bring us to some system or some man but to tell us we need to return back to the word in its pureness and not to be joined to a system an organization or denomination something that man has built contrary to the word father you called us back to jesus christ and he is the word may oh god our eyes of our understanding be enlightened that jesus died for our sins that he shattered his precious blood there's no savior not moses not elijah but save jesus only brother sister friend is that someone this morning that have not accepted jesus christ in our lives maybe you've been holding on to something but you're willing to give it up for jesus because you know jesus he can help you if you want help thank you is there someone else that's out here but thank you god you you the deliverer thank you thank you you're the one father these that have lifted their hands their hearts open it's
