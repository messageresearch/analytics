[43:43] and 13.
[43:45] he says
[43:49] when God made a promise to Abraham
[43:52] because he could swear by no greater he
[43:54] swear by himself saying surely blessing
[43:58] I would bless thee and multiply and I
[44:00] would multiply thee and so after he had
[44:04] patiently endured he attained the
[44:08] promise
[44:09] for men verily swear by the greater and
[44:13] of of confirmation is to them and end of
[44:17] all Strife when God willing more bullet
[44:21] lead is shown to the ears of Promise the
[44:24] immutability of his cancer confirmed it
[44:27] by an oath
[44:28] and that by two immutable things which
[44:32] it is impossible for God to lie we might
[44:37] have strong consolation who have fled
[44:41] for refuse to lay hold upon the hopes
[44:45] set before us which hope we have as an
[44:49] ankle of the Soul both sure and
[44:52] steadfast and which entered into that
[44:56] within the veil
[44:58] where whether the Forerunner for us
[45:02] entered even Jesus made and high priests
[45:07] Forever After The Order Of mckessidan
[45:10] God bless you to work you may be seated
[45:14] foreign
[45:16] we thought this morning I
[45:19] I wanted to talk about the promised land
[45:22] and
[45:23] and what promises we have in Christ
[45:27] Jesus for our promised land is that God
[45:30] made a promise to us of the baptism of
[45:33] the Holy Ghost
[45:34] and that promise of the Holy Ghost is
[45:37] not only amen for amen this life but he
[45:41] promised eternal life
[45:44] and the Holy Ghost is uh just a down
[45:47] payment just an earnings of our
[45:49] inheritance what God would give to us
[45:53] that put our trust and our confidence in
[45:55] him
[45:56] and so we talked about the promises of
[45:59] God God made a promise and we said that
[46:04] God made a promise in Hebrews says that
[46:07] God promises impossible for God to tell
[46:10] us a lie
[46:11] it's impossible for God to lie if God
[46:15] told you amen promises nothing it's
[46:18] impossible for God to lie and God
[46:21] because of his power and who he is he's
[46:24] able to keep his promise
[46:27] amen he's able to fulfill what he
[46:30] promised you and I
[46:31] amen God is good amen
[46:34] and we'll trusting that you would put
[46:37] your confidence in God that he will
[46:39] fulfill his promises but it's a lot of
[46:42] things if I was down on my knees praying
[46:44] this morning and I got up and you know
[46:47] and
[46:48] I I said uh some of it was yesterday
[46:52] when we were in proud and I said is it
[46:55] is it worth what God promised us is it
[46:58] worth it
[47:00] because a lot of times you know people
[47:02] can promise you something amen and you
[47:06] know and sometimes if we want what they
[47:09] promise then we'll uh trust and be an
[47:13] expectation of it
[47:16] you know somebody said well I promise
[47:18] I'll buy you a car when you get 18. and
[47:21] uh so the children are looking
[47:23] anticipating only uh uh upon you know
[47:27] good behavior and you keep your grades
[47:29] up in school and so forth and that you
[47:32] will get this uh so you're looking
[47:34] forward to it so you try to keep your
[47:37] grades up and your behavior and your
[47:39] conduct of life because I'm expecting to
[47:42] get a car at 18.
[47:45] amen well what if a child just do all
[47:47] kind of crazy stuff and amen don't keep
[47:50] the grades up and not you know having
[47:53] trouble in the school can you trust them
[47:55] with a car at 18.
[47:57] and then you say well you know you know
[48:00] I I said I'll get you a call but you
[48:03] know because of your conduct I I believe
[48:06] I got a hold back I'll wait till you get
[48:09] 21.
[48:11] are you with me
[48:13] so it's because of our conduct duck it's
[48:17] not that I'm gonna I'm not gonna get you
[48:19] to come but I'm gonna wait till you get
[48:21] a little bit more matured
[48:24] are you up man
[48:25] see because if I give it to you before
[48:27] you're even a Hound it then you might
[48:30] get out there and wreck you might put
[48:32] all kind of folks in the car and all
[48:35] kind of things it might cause you amen
[48:38] not to you know conduct yourself in a
[48:42] way you wouldn't have conducted yourself
[48:43] if you didn't have a car
[48:46] but you haven't proved to the parents
[48:49] that you can have it
[48:50] and uh God made promises to us that he
[48:55] wants to give to us but it's uh it's not
[48:58] that God won't give it to us he's
[49:00] willing to give us all the blessings
[49:03] that amen that comes with being children
[49:06] of Abraham and you know sometimes I've
[49:09] said you know it's not the because uh
[49:12] you know the Jews because they were Jews
[49:15] they thought because they were Jews they
[49:17] had uh certain Privileges and because of
[49:21] circumcision and everything they thought
[49:24] they were had certain privileges and you
[49:26] know some folks because we go to church
[49:28] because we say we're Christian because
[49:30] we say we believe God we think that we
[49:33] are privileged people
[49:35] amen and we all we're inheritance of the
[49:38] promises of God because we amen are
[49:42] Christians and because we believe him
[49:44] amen and then all the Bible tells us in
[49:48] Romans 2 it says he's not a Jew that is
[49:51] one hourly
[49:52] sometimes we think we're privileged
[49:54] because amen we believe that God sent a
[49:57] prophet and we uh you know we believe
[49:59] the message of the hour and so forth
[50:01] like they said we have Abraham for our
[50:04] father amen the Jews thought that
[50:06] Abraham Heisman and Jacob oh we got we
[50:09] can look back and we have those great uh
[50:12] Patriot odds that we can identify we can
[50:16] tell we're of their bloodline
[50:18] and you know sometimes we brag about
[50:21] what we have amen but he said not not
[50:25] not because you're a Christian because
[50:27] you say I believe in Jesus I've accepted
[50:30] him as my savior he said he's not a Jew
[50:33] that is one I will live but one Everly
[50:36] the circumcision is not of the flesh you
[50:39] know not uh you mean you may look like a
[50:42] Christian amen you may I think that
[50:45] you're a Christian you may you know look
[50:47] like amen everything is fine but he said
[50:50] our circumcision we can walk with our
[50:53] heads up and we can be proud that uh you
[50:56] know I am a really a Christian but the
[50:58] circumcision must be of the heart
[51:01] oh you want man it's got to be something
[51:04] that God has done with our hearts
[51:08] amen if we are not circumcising hard
[51:11] amen then I'll form of Christianity
[51:17] are saying that but amen well I I I'm of
[51:21] this persuasion I'm of that persuasive
[51:23] they were Pharisees inside your seeds
[51:25] and all of that and it was Abraham's
[51:28] seed Paul says amen I was Abraham seed
[51:31] and so forth I can look back in my
[51:33] bloodline you can check my DNA out I'm a
[51:36] child of Abraham and we can say I'm a
[51:39] Christian but what about our hearts
[51:43] and we worship God Amen he said he told
[51:46] a woman that the world neither this
[51:48] mountain is in Jerusalem
[51:50] but it's come a time when the true
[51:52] worship of God going to worship Him in
[51:54] spirit
[51:56] and in truth isn't that right so it's
[51:59] going to take more than just amen
[52:01] identified with a certain group of
[52:04] certain uh people it meant that we can
[52:07] shout and dance and amen praise the Lord
[52:10] because I'm this and I'm that amen it's
[52:13] going to take something Amen to change
[52:16] our inside
[52:21] it's the inside that needs changing amen
[52:25] because outside him and you may look
[52:27] holy amen you may act even in a certain
[52:30] way but is it or you're right in the
[52:33] inside of your heart right with God
[52:36] praise God because God is not going to
[52:38] judge your outside he gonna judge
[52:40] whether your heart is right
[52:45] and I'm gonna tell you something you can
[52:47] never buy what you can achieve or what
[52:50] you do and what you can accomplish that
[52:53] will make your heart right
[52:56] are you with me
[52:57] the Bible tells us salvation is of the
[53:00] Lord
[53:01] it's God that does that you cannot do it
[53:05] with human effort amen all our works and
[53:08] all that we try to do in the cloud that
[53:11] we've done amen it will never save us
[53:15] we'll see by faith through Grace and not
[53:18] of wax at least any man should most but
[53:22] it is the gift of God
[53:24] amen because God Amen has graced Upon
[53:29] Our Lives and that he came down and he
[53:32] died for our sin
[53:34] amen it's because of the blood and he
[53:37] said
[53:38] it's because of what he done for us that
[53:42] day on Calvary
[53:44] that makes a difference for us right now
[53:47] and I said Lord thank you
[53:50] I'm not trying to
[53:52] is it worth it
[53:54] sometimes we have to count up the cause
[53:56] God made us promises
[53:59] but sometimes I know
[54:02] sometimes the Infidel battle in his mind
[54:06] and sometimes the agnostic battles
[54:10] within themselves and sometimes there
[54:13] are people amen that's Christian but
[54:16] there are some that are slightly down
[54:18] amen is this Christianity is it real
[54:21] it's just God is it it does he does he
[54:25] really exist
[54:26] because in their kind of mind and in the
[54:29] intellectual way of thinking they would
[54:31] say God that will allow all of this to
[54:35] be taken place in the earth
[54:37] and yet we say he's a god of love
[54:40] yet we say is a God that cares and
[54:43] understands
[54:44] amen
[54:46] in my spirit amen
[54:49] last night is uh that's why I said I
[54:52] woke up this morning with my mind
[54:54] stand on Jesus
[54:56] so in my spirit I I felt pretty good
[55:00] because I was wrestling with the devil
[55:02] last night
[55:04] amen because all of those things you're
[55:06] confronted with and you have to wrestle
[55:09] amen so because the devil had amen he
[55:13] brings you up to points in your life and
[55:16] the places in your life that you wrestle
[55:20] and and as something rolls up in me amen
[55:24] and said God said don't you put that on
[55:28] me
[55:29] all the sickness and all the pains and
[55:32] all the death and everything that's
[55:34] going wrong don't put that on me
[55:38] amen well you said why did God allow
[55:42] sometimes we feel like it when God made
[55:45] the Angels say amen and he made man he
[55:48] said everything was good
[55:50] but what would it be like if God just
[55:52] made robots
[55:54] and just tuned him in and says okay
[55:58] you do this and that's all you can do
[56:01] would you rather be a robot where God
[56:04] says we just only good existing amen
[56:07] that's all you can do when I made you I
[56:10] made you amen for this and that's all
[56:12] you can do
[56:15] but will you like to have freedom of
[56:18] choice
[56:19] would you rather be a free moral agent
[56:22] where God gives you the opportunity
[56:25] to make your own decision
[56:29] when God made Lucifer he was not amen he
[56:33] was not the devil he was not amen evil
[56:37] God made him good but inside of Lucifer
[56:40] his desire
[56:43] amen that amen I'm not satisfied with
[56:47] being next to God I believe I can run
[56:49] this place
[56:51] I believe I can take over heaven
[56:54] there's nobody God let him do what he
[56:56] did called the third of the Angels why
[56:59] did God do that you talk to him when you
[57:01] get there
[57:04] but it was it was because he had a
[57:07] decision amen was it not uh amen I'm
[57:10] just going to worship God and I'ma stay
[57:13] in my position or whether or not he
[57:15] found that hey
[57:17] did I see God and I see all the angels I
[57:20] I believe I ought to have that
[57:24] and that's the way when the Garden of
[57:26] Eden God gave them a choice
[57:28] amen you got everything I give you
[57:31] dominion over everything the Earth and
[57:33] all the fishing to see the birds of the
[57:36] air over everything
[57:38] only one thing I want you to do
[57:41] don't touch the tree of knowledge and
[57:42] good and evil and don't eat of that
[57:46] but man chosen amen that
[57:50] but she wasn't even she just didn't do
[57:54] that because what Lucifer did in heaven
[57:56] he came down to the Earth and he got
[57:58] into serpent and he deceived the woman
[58:02] amen now why are you going to charge God
[58:05] for it when the Devil Himself deceived
[58:09] the woman but yet we put it on God why
[58:11] did God lie that he could have not not
[58:13] let the death but the woman had a choice
[58:17] Adam and Eve had a choice
[58:20] amen they could have said well no I'm
[58:22] gonna stick to what God Said I I don't
[58:25] care what the devil said I don't care
[58:27] how good the tree look I'm gonna stick
[58:30] to what God Said
[58:33] are you with me
[58:34] but they made a decision and he made a
[58:37] decision or I I think you know I think I
[58:41] just
[58:42] try it out
[58:44] and that's the way we are today
[58:47] he said behold I said before your life
[58:49] and death you choose
[58:51] and then when we make the wrong
[58:53] decisions we blame God for our decision
[58:58] the Bible said in Adam all died
[59:02] calls out on the job amen amen Adam saw
[59:06] what he did he could have made a
[59:08] decision I'm not going to do what you
[59:09] did but she did it too
[59:12] are you up man and because of what he
[59:15] did everybody that was born of a woman
[59:18] was born and said you mad at Adam
[59:22] you know some folks are better than Mom
[59:24] and Daddy for bringing them in there
[59:27] mama daddy you you you had no business
[59:30] bringing me here because it's an evil
[59:32] please
[59:34] are you with me
[59:36] so and that's the way the minds of folks
[59:40] are
[59:42] they complain about them being here
[59:45] instead of understanding while I'm here
[59:48] I have a decision to me
[59:52] I can choose a life or I can choose
[59:55] death I can choose good I could choose
[59:58] evil
[1:00:00] I have a decision to make
[1:00:03] what do I want
[1:00:05] do I want to choose good or do I want to
[1:00:08] choose evil
[1:00:10] and then if I choose evil the
[1:00:12] consequences of what my charges are it
[1:00:15] causes my life to be affected by my
[1:00:18] choice
[1:00:22] so I am alive if it's going in a bad way
[1:00:26] it may be what Mama did or what Daddy
[1:00:29] did or what Grandmama did because my
[1:00:32] life to be like it is
[1:00:34] because the sins
[1:00:37] up the parent can go into the third and
[1:00:41] fourth generation
[1:00:43] amen but the curse that's down can be
[1:00:46] broken
[1:00:48] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:51] if I make a decision
[1:00:54] I didn't have nothing to do with my
[1:00:57] birth
[1:00:59] amen
[1:01:00] I had no choice in being here
[1:01:03] but after I get here I have a decision
[1:01:06] that I can make whether or not I want to
[1:01:10] live
[1:01:11] for God
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:15] am I going to continue I I see my birth
[1:01:18] and by Nature I have the nature
[1:01:22] of Adam and Eve
[1:01:25] it's in me to do wrong
[1:01:28] but that the last item which was Jesus
[1:01:30] Christ come to take away that sin for
[1:01:33] nation and said I'll give you a choice
[1:01:36] you can choose the last item and live
[1:01:39] or you can stay with the first nature
[1:01:41] which is the first Adam and you can die
[1:01:45] amen now you got to believe
[1:01:48] that God that made a promise to you he's
[1:01:52] not lying to you
[1:01:54] he if he made a promise to you you got
[1:01:57] to believe that God promises for you a
[1:02:00] yea and not name amen that he wants to
[1:02:03] bless you he wants to do you good
[1:02:07] and not evil
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:11] he loves you enough to give his life for
[1:02:14] you
[1:02:14] and to die for your sin but somehow just
[1:02:20] like Eve the devil convinced her amen
[1:02:24] don't you do what God Said
[1:02:26] amen because it's a better way
[1:02:29] are you
[1:02:31] he's convincing folks today don't you do
[1:02:35] what God said because amen you can make
[1:02:39] your own mind of
[1:02:41] what you want
[1:02:43] doesn't make a difference whether it
[1:02:45] pleases God or not please yourself
[1:02:49] because there is no God
[1:02:53] there is if God was God why
[1:02:56] I said don't put this
[1:02:59] pain sickness and sorrow and all this uh
[1:03:03] evil and that don't put it on God
[1:03:07] you never knew amen what causes folks to
[1:03:11] be blind
[1:03:13] the disciples asked Jesus who the man
[1:03:17] was born blind he said who sinned this
[1:03:19] man or his parents
[1:03:22] it's neither one of them he said this
[1:03:25] was the one that I might be glorified
[1:03:28] are you with me and Jesus prayed and
[1:03:31] gave the man his sight isn't that right
[1:03:33] and see but they understood that I could
[1:03:36] be amen like I am because of some great
[1:03:40] Grandmama did a granddaddy did
[1:03:43] now go put it on God Amen God didn't do
[1:03:46] it
[1:03:47] are you with me
[1:03:48] I I that's what I want you to see God
[1:03:51] did not do all of this crime and all
[1:03:54] this wickedness and all this stuff
[1:03:55] that's going on in the world all this
[1:03:57] evil God didn't do it but there is a
[1:04:00] devil here
[1:04:02] there is a devil that seeks to steal the
[1:04:06] kill and destroy
[1:04:09] are you a man but Jesus said I come that
[1:04:12] they might
[1:04:14] have life and that they might have it
[1:04:16] what
[1:04:17] more abundantly
[1:04:19] are you with me
[1:04:21] so it's your decision this morning what
[1:04:25] do I want
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:29] God made us promises
[1:04:32] somebody said exceeding great and
[1:04:34] precious promises
[1:04:36] are you up there
[1:04:38] but we amen because
[1:04:41] sometimes
[1:04:43] we believe that Satan told a lie isn't
[1:04:46] that right in the beginning he told a
[1:04:49] lie didn't he
[1:04:51] but the Bible said it's impossible for
[1:04:53] God to what
[1:04:54] to tell you a lie
[1:04:57] if God if it's impossible for God to
[1:04:59] tell you a lie amen Who you gonna
[1:05:01] believe we know Satan is a liar the
[1:05:04] Bible said he is a liar and the what
[1:05:07] in the father of lions and he was the
[1:05:10] one amen that started the line all
[1:05:13] together
[1:05:14] are you with me
[1:05:16] so if Satan is a liar and the father of
[1:05:19] Liars who are you gonna believe a God
[1:05:21] that it's impossible for him to lie
[1:05:26] are you gonna trust him for his promises
[1:05:29] that he made towards you
[1:05:32] praise God
[1:05:34] I said you know sometimes when we when
[1:05:37] we're going through we doubt whether or
[1:05:40] not dog gonna do what he said the
[1:05:41] children of Israel God made a promise
[1:05:43] said after 400 years I'm going to
[1:05:45] deliver you out of the land of Egypt
[1:05:47] isn't that right
[1:05:49] so uh uh God made that promise to them
[1:05:52] and they were Journey on to the promised
[1:05:54] land isn't that right but all through
[1:05:56] that Journey they began to disbelieve
[1:05:59] God and to doubt God
[1:06:01] and your Christian walk and all through
[1:06:05] your journey amen folks amen that God
[1:06:09] saved from their sins
[1:06:11] but God saved them from the Egyptians
[1:06:14] saved them from their sin but after that
[1:06:17] he had to destroy them because they did
[1:06:20] not
[1:06:21] they didn't believe
[1:06:24] amen when you stop trusting God for
[1:06:27] being who he is
[1:06:29] amen after all he does for you and I and
[1:06:34] after all he's done for you and I amen
[1:06:37] why should we doubt him in any aspect of
[1:06:41] our journey
[1:06:44] for he said I would never
[1:06:47] I'll never leave you neither will I
[1:06:51] oh
[1:06:53] but if you trust him
[1:06:56] amen amen if you trust him and do not
[1:06:59] doubt him
[1:07:01] he will surely
[1:07:04] bring you out
[1:07:06] praise God here take you in a place
[1:07:10] amen that you would not have to worry
[1:07:13] about anything
[1:07:16] praise God job had come to that place he
[1:07:20] said no you slay me yeah shall I trust
[1:07:24] you
[1:07:24] thank God I believe you're hearing how I
[1:07:28] go through some hard times
[1:07:31] but thank you Jesus
[1:07:34] I'm not gonna doubt you
[1:07:37] let me because I found out a long time
[1:07:40] ago
[1:07:41] that I know that my redeemer lives
[1:07:45] your garden look like it
[1:07:48] look at it but God said I'll never leave
[1:07:50] you
[1:07:51] and I'll never forsake you
[1:07:54] and second Peter's third chapter said
[1:07:57] the Lord
[1:07:58] is not slight
[1:08:00] concerning his promises
[1:08:03] as some men do counsel like this
[1:08:06] but he's what
[1:08:08] long suffering
[1:08:10] God suffer long for you and I
[1:08:13] he could come and say Amen Let the third
[1:08:16] world war and let man destroy himself
[1:08:19] but God is long-suffering he knew that
[1:08:22] one day you would hear the gospel
[1:08:24] trumpet
[1:08:25] amen and you were healed that there's a
[1:08:28] God that loves you
[1:08:29] that the god that cares about you the
[1:08:32] other Jesus that died for you amen and
[1:08:36] one day amen you come Amen in grips with
[1:08:40] Amen to the reality that God did God for
[1:08:43] me amen amen the god that gave his life
[1:08:47] for them
[1:08:48] ah Lord I believe
[1:08:51] Lord I believe in you
[1:08:54] and Lord I want to take you out your
