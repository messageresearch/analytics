[36:32] isaiah 55 i'm going through
[36:37] praise god god is good amen
[36:41] his mercies everlasting
[36:44] if we only knew how good he
[36:49] he's been to us
[36:52] then we would be super excited about
[36:55] the goodness of the lord
[36:59] i believe david had experienced his
[37:01] goodness
[37:02] [Music]
[37:04] but he said surely goodness and mercy
[37:05] should follow me all the days of my life
[37:07] [Music]
[37:09] and he said old taste and see that the
[37:11] lord he is good
[37:15] isaiah 55 says oh everyone
[37:19] hold everyone that thirsts
[37:25] come ye to the water
[37:28] he that has no money come ye buy
[37:31] eat yay come buy wine
[37:35] milk without money without price
[37:40] wherefore do you spend money for that
[37:43] which is
[37:44] not bread and your labor for that which
[37:47] satisfied not heart and diligent to me
[37:50] and eat ye that which is good
[37:53] and let your soul delight itself in
[37:56] fatness
[37:57] incline your ear and come unto me
[38:01] here and what
[38:05] here and what
[38:09] are you listening here and your what
[38:16] and i will make an everlasting covenant
[38:19] with you
[38:21] even the sure mercies of david
[38:24] god bless you read this word you may be
[38:25] seated
[38:31] by the grace of god we thank god for
[38:34] his grace this morning i heard god's
[38:38] servant
[38:39] speak on salvation without price
[38:44] salvation without price so we like to
[38:48] share because
[38:53] you know even the folks that said they
[38:55] saved
[38:59] seem as though they have a lack of
[39:02] understanding
[39:03] a lack of love for god
[39:10] and we have those that
[39:14] choose not to be saved
[39:20] as the prophet god says they reject
[39:23] salvation
[39:26] they're rejected they don't want it
[39:29] don't want to be saved
[39:33] and those that supposedly
[39:36] understand and supposed to be saved
[39:41] their very life
[39:43] is an evident and a proof that they're
[39:45] not
[39:49] so you got those that are uh
[39:52] don't want to be saved those that claim
[39:54] to be saved then you've got those that
[39:56] are really truly saved
[39:59] as he said they're three kind of
[40:00] believers
[40:04] you have to make believers you have the
[40:06] unbelievers and you have the true
[40:07] believers
[40:09] are you with me
[40:13] well we find that seemed like in a
[40:16] lukewarm
[40:17] age as layout of syria is that you have
[40:20] more make-believers
[40:24] a individual don't mind cursing you out
[40:27] and at the same time when they finish
[40:30] say god bless you brother
[40:37] seems like there's a lack of
[40:38] understanding
[40:40] of concerning salvation it seems like
[40:43] folk
[40:44] don't get it no more
[40:47] oh how we long to see individuals that
[40:50] would really give their life to the lord
[40:52] jesus christ and accept
[40:53] salvation that without price and free
[40:56] salvation
[40:58] how we long to see that hunger and
[41:01] thirsty
[41:02] soul oh those that thirst
[41:08] they meant come and buy
[41:12] but it got it's got to be that thirst
[41:16] and i'm going to tell you brother and
[41:17] sister amen
[41:20] jesus said no man can come to me except
[41:22] the father
[41:23] my father drawing
[41:27] and i'm saying that thirst that thirsty
[41:30] soul
[41:32] that individual that really desire amen
[41:35] not
[41:35] church amen
[41:40] you know sometimes folks just looking
[41:42] for uh
[41:45] a nice place to worship
[41:50] uh they're looking for friendship on the
[41:53] different things that
[41:54] folks are looking for but salvation
[42:01] i'll tell you i long to see people
[42:05] that'll
[42:06] want god now
[42:10] i long to see people that want to let
[42:13] god know they appreciate him
[42:19] you know it's coming so cold outside
[42:25] they mean the pandemic has taken its
[42:27] effect on the
[42:28] event church well and so people look
[42:31] like they're lost enthusiasts
[42:36] you know when you don't have face to
[42:38] face and you know
[42:41] and get a chance to fellowship like we
[42:43] used to but it seemed like people have
[42:45] the bible said the love of many gonna
[42:47] watch coal
[42:51] people have cooled off so much so
[42:53] there's no lord it's jar
[42:55] to have true worship anymore
[42:58] people don't decide or you know you know
[43:01] come together because they can
[43:03] i can make it without it
[43:08] the bible says we see the evil day and
[43:10] we see
[43:11] uh approaching we ought to come together
[43:14] even
[43:14] more well we know the pandemic that put
