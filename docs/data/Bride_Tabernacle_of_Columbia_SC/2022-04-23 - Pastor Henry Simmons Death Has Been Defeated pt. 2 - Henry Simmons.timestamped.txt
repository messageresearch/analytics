[33:16] word in jesus christ's name amen
[33:24] we want to continue
[33:26] from continuation from sunday morning
[33:29] and um
[33:31] i want to remind everybody
[33:34] prayer would be moved up the lord
[33:37] swelling from five o'clock to four
[33:39] o'clock
[33:40] on saturday so if you
[33:42] come to prayer and you
[33:44] used to come and it'd be from four to
[33:46] five instead of five to six
[33:48] okay on saturday
[33:51] god bless
[33:52] um romans 6 as we
[33:55] were reading there
[33:58] it says
[33:59] what shall we say then shall we continue
[34:02] and sin that grace from our bound
[34:04] god forbid how shall we that are dead to
[34:06] sin and living along with the end
[34:08] no you're not that so many of us as
[34:10] we're baptized into jesus christ were
[34:12] baptized into his death therefore we'll
[34:14] bury him by baptism into death that life
[34:17] is christ has risen
[34:19] up rates raised up from the dead by the
[34:22] glory of the father even so we also
[34:24] should walk in newness of life
[34:26] for if we have been planted together in
[34:28] the likeness of his death we shall be
[34:30] also in the likeness of his what
[34:33] knowing this that our old man is what
[34:37] crucified with him that the body of sin
[34:39] might be what
[34:41] destroyed and
[34:43] that henceforth we should not what
[34:46] for he that is is free from
[34:50] amen god bless the reading towards you
[34:52] may be seated i just want to
[34:56] you know what says um
[34:58] what does the resurrection
[34:59] mean to each and every one of us
[35:02] amen
[35:03] and we said the resurrection to us means
[35:06] that death has been defeated
[35:08] amen and that death has been defeated
[35:11] the bible says
[35:13] uh
[35:14] the day that they touch or eat of the
[35:17] tree of knowledge and good and evil
[35:18] that's the day that died
[35:20] so death entered in because of sin
[35:24] and sin amen
[35:26] death is a result of sin disobedience to
[35:29] god's word
[35:31] amen
[35:32] and we cannot get around amen and when
[35:35] we disobey god's word then death sets in
[35:40] are you with me so there are many people
[35:42] that are disobedient to god's word that
[35:45] are still walking around dead
[35:47] but they they don't have the knowledge
[35:49] that they're dead
[35:51] now
[35:52] ephesian i kind of quoted that but let's
[35:55] go to ephesians 2
[35:56] and let's just look at that
[35:58] um
[36:00] death has been defeated
[36:03] tonight death has been defeated
[36:06] so we want to take it from a standpoint
[36:08] to slow it down and kind of let you look
[36:10] at it from a teaching standpoint death
[36:13] has been defeated
[36:15] now
[36:16] the world you know look at it and
[36:19] and the bible talks about the second
[36:21] death
[36:22] but the bible said blessing is he holy
[36:25] is he that has part in the first
[36:26] resurrection for in the second death
[36:28] there's no power
[36:30] are you with me
[36:32] so maybe we'll look there and let you
[36:34] see that there is another death cause of
[36:36] second death and the second death is the
[36:38] lake of fire so there's a lake of fire
[36:42] amen that will accomplish
[36:45] if we leave this world amen that's not
[36:47] the end that's just the beginning
[36:50] that's just the beginning of
[36:52] your trip even into eternity or your
[36:55] trip into
[36:57] um
[36:58] he said
[37:00] if we love the lord we should not perish
[37:02] but have everlasting life to appointed
[37:05] time
[37:06] that
[37:07] god will
[37:08] actually
[37:10] take those into judgment and they have
[37:12] to pay
[37:14] for their sins
[37:15] because they did not
[37:17] accept
[37:18] jesus christ payment for their sin so
[37:21] they have to pay for their sins because
[37:23] they did not receive
[37:25] amen jesus christ paying for their sins
[37:29] are you with me
[37:30] so we either choose
[37:32] to accept what jesus
[37:34] did for us
[37:36] are we
[37:37] are going to pay for everything
[37:40] that we've ever done
[37:42] are you with me
[37:45] so ephesians 2 he says
[37:47] here it says and he has
[37:51] and you
[37:52] now you that means me and you
[37:55] has he what
[37:57] quicken that means he's bought a lie
[38:01] amen you has he quickened he's made us
[38:04] alive
[38:05] are you with me
[38:06] now
[38:08] as we quote romans uh 8 and 11
[38:11] he said if the spirit to raise jesus up
[38:13] from the dead y'all want to look at it
[38:16] and maybe y'all want to look at it
[38:17] because
[38:19] romans 8 and 11 as we look look at this
[38:22] uh
[38:23] and
[38:24] i was in um kentucky i was talking about
[38:26] quickening power
[38:28] so you has a quicken
[38:31] who was dead in trespass in sin
[38:34] okay
[38:36] now here in
[38:37] romans 8 11
[38:39] he says what
[38:43] at the spirit of him that raised what
[38:47] jesus from the dead what
[38:50] dwell where
[38:52] see brother and sister it's it's a it's
[38:55] a point that if the spirit to raise
[38:58] jesus from the dead if it dwell in you
[39:00] it shall also what
[39:03] by his
[39:05] spirit that dwells in you
[39:07] so that that's your rapture in faith
[39:10] your rapture and power is going to alive
[39:12] what's inside of you if you don't have
[39:14] the quicken power a lot of people go to
[39:16] church and they're religious
[39:18] it's got a lot of religious people a lot
[39:20] of people pray and say their prayers are
[39:21] answered and all kind of things that go
[39:23] on in their lives
[39:25] and they and truly you know sometimes it
[39:28] looks like their prayers might be
[39:29] answered before yours
[39:32] and um they can claim you know and they
[39:34] can curse they can smoke they can drink
[39:37] they can lie they can steal they can
[39:38] cheat they can fornicate adultery and
[39:41] all of that and they pray and their
[39:43] prayers answered so you said
[39:45] brother how
[39:48] how can you explain that the bible tells
[39:50] us the range falls on the jets and the
[39:52] unjust
[39:54] amen and the bible says god here is not
[39:56] a sinner
[39:58] amen and god says because of your
[40:00] iniquities i won't hear your prayers
[40:02] and yet they praying and things happen
[40:05] for
[40:06] she said well explain that i'm not going
[40:08] to explain that i know the word of god
[40:10] is right
[40:11] what god said in his word amen is right
[40:14] because of our nickname because our sin
[40:17] god said he hide his face from us
[40:19] he said when he when we pray he won't
[40:21] answer
[40:22] but yet they tree for praying yet they
[40:25] say their prayers answered yet god has
[40:27] mercy on
[40:30] so what is it the bible said if you have
[40:32] faith
[40:35] and not doubt in your heart
[40:37] see faith
[40:38] caused god to move
[40:40] faith causes god to move when a person
[40:43] have faith
[40:45] in
[40:46] perhaps
[40:48] that god would hear their prayer
[40:51] and they have faith in what when they
[40:53] pray that god will move or never have
[40:57] just a person walking in faith that's
[40:59] part of the word that they that's what
[41:01] they claim and that's what they walk in
[41:03] that part of the world they believe they
[41:05] got faith and they believe amen if i
[41:07] pray god asks them yet
[41:11] look at their lives see because jesus
[41:12] said many don't come to me in that day
[41:14] so lord let me cast out devils you've
[41:16] done many wonderful works in your name
[41:17] you're going to set it apart from me
[41:18] your work is of what
[41:20] i don't even know you
[41:22] isn't that right
[41:23] so
[41:24] you know the word the word got an answer
[41:27] to all these different situations but we
[41:29] don't want to take time out trying to
[41:31] explain amen because people feel
[41:33] confident and feel so saved and and yet
[41:36] they they
[41:37] they don't see no reason to stop sinning
[41:40] amen because they've been blessing their
[41:42] sins
[41:44] are you with me
[41:45] but thank me to god he's he's he's given
[41:48] us conviction he's given us a heart amen
[41:51] that we want to live right we want to do
[41:53] right amen we don't want to
[41:56] take advantage of god's grace
[41:59] amen that's what he said what shall we
[42:01] uh uh say then should we continue in sin
[42:04] that what
[42:05] grace may abound god forbid how should
[42:08] we the dead to sin living and longer
[42:10] what
[42:11] they're in amen we don't want to keep on
[42:14] living in sin and taking advantage of
[42:17] god's grace amen you know
[42:20] you know uh mama and daddy might you
[42:22] know if if you keep on you know being
[42:25] bad and getting in trouble and then
[42:28] getting you out of trouble or paying
[42:30] your bills for you or doing this for you
[42:33] and then you and sometimes okay you
[42:36] gonna waste your money up mama mama damn
[42:39] my life's about to get caught up daddy
[42:41] daddy and they have a little grace keep
[42:43] on having grace on one of these times
[42:45] they said do i get tired
[42:48] coming to mama daddy
[42:52] you know
[42:54] the children ain't got no need and
[42:56] what mama might feel sorry for the
[42:58] children and you know daddy might feel
[43:00] children for children or something but
[43:02] it's a time where grace run out on you
[43:05] mama is not there for you that is not
[43:07] for that
[43:08] they're for you there's a time when
[43:10] god's grace may run out on you
[43:13] amen god tells you not to do that amen
[43:17] and mama might tell you don't don't
[43:19] don't spend your money foolish just
[43:21] don't do this don't do that daddy might
[43:23] tell you be wise son be wise daughter
[43:25] amen but we don't want to be wise so
[43:28] what happens when
[43:30] mama don't have it no more daddy don't
[43:31] have it no more
[43:34] then you in trouble then isn't that
[43:36] right
[43:36] so what happens if either we come to
[43:39] reality amen
[43:41] should we amen stop and and and do right
[43:46] and do the things that we know amen
[43:48] that's going to bless us and amen going
[43:50] to help us even be comfortable in this
[43:53] world amen but we're talking about
[43:55] eternal life
[43:56] we're talking about going to heaven
[43:59] amen
[44:01] okay now
[44:03] we
[44:04] i guess we got romans we're back in the
[44:06] ephesians
[44:07] it says
[44:10] when in time past you walk according to
[44:13] the course of this world
[44:17] amen
[44:18] it was dead in trespassing sin
[44:21] and in time past you walk according to
[44:23] the course of this world
[44:26] excuse me according to the go to this
[44:29] world cup according to the prince and
[44:31] power and i have the spirit that now
[44:33] worketh in the children disobedient
[44:35] now when we were there we were
[44:36] disobedient children
[44:38] you know what i'm saying disobedient to
[44:40] what this would reading to god's word
[44:43] we were disobedient to god's word
[44:46] now god always he tells us if we be
[44:49] disobedient children god's going to
[44:51] chastise us isn't that right
[44:54] see because if you belong to god god's
[44:56] going to bring chastisement so it's
[44:58] going to be a minute that are chastised
[45:00] because they're disobedient
[45:03] and there's going to be obedient
[45:05] children that god said thank you you
[45:07] know this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[45:09] well please i'm pleased to dwell in
[45:12] amen
[45:13] oftentimes god said i'll never leave you
[45:16] neither will i forsake you but many
[45:18] times folk leave god
[45:21] it's not that god left them they left
[45:23] god
[45:24] god cannot abide with you when you're
[45:27] doing wrong because god
[45:31] see and that's what people got to
[45:33] understand god can't stay with you if
[45:35] you're doing wrong well god you're
[45:37] whipped me with me in the nightclub what
[45:40] you're in adultery is like what you
[45:42] ain't listening with you
[45:43] no no amen god is with the righteous
[45:48] god is a holy god god is a righteous god
[45:50] god is a just god
[45:52] amen god is not with
[45:55] he's angry with the wicked every day
[45:58] okay
[46:00] so by the grace of god let us just um
[46:05] death has been defeated
[46:07] romans uh i mean let's go to um first
[46:10] corinthians 15
[46:11] first corinthians 15 and 20.
[46:14] i think i left off there a little bit he
[46:16] says and now has christ risen from the
[46:19] dead
[46:20] and become
[46:21] the first fruits of them that slept
[46:26] you know many times the people's quote
[46:29] the wave sheet often that was waved over
[46:31] the uh uh the people the first one to
[46:34] come to maturity was uh the prophet
[46:39] no the first one came to maturity with
[46:41] jesus christ
[46:43] are you with me
[46:45] and
[46:46] the one that was waving over the people
[46:48] amen
[46:50] it was jesus christ
[46:52] are you with me
[46:54] and you find about 90
[46:56] 80 and 90 percent of the people don't
[46:58] you know they give too much honor you
[47:01] know wait
[47:03] are you with me
[47:05] jesus was the first
[47:07] fruit
[47:08] of the resurrection are you with me
[47:11] so you got to listen closely because
[47:13] you'll be amen and you'll be shouting
[47:15] off the wrong stuff
[47:17] i see the people ah
[47:19] they're shouting off the wrong stuff the
[47:21] bible says studies show yourself or what
[47:24] approve it to god or what we need not to
[47:26] read what
[47:27] shame amen because the persons sound
[47:29] like they know what they're talking
[47:30] about
[47:31] you know i'm saying sometimes we get
[47:33] caught up
[47:34] but we need to be
[47:36] you know
[47:37] i'm not saying don't say amen don't say
[47:39] hallelujah amen but you got to be keen
[47:42] enough to know
[47:43] what when a person is telling you
[47:45] something wrong
[47:47] okay
[47:49] he said he was the first and become the
[47:51] first fruit of them to slap
[47:54] nobody else jesus christ
[47:56] are you what man
[47:58] it says
[48:00] for since by man came death
[48:03] and by man came also what
[48:07] the resurrection
[48:09] y'all see that 21st verse 15 15. for
[48:12] since my man came what
[48:15] death
[48:17] by man came also what resurrection jesus
[48:21] said i am the resurrection and what
[48:23] he delivered and believe in me should
[48:25] never
[48:26] never die isn't that right
[48:28] see that's what your confidence is in
[48:31] you know if if you believe in him and
[48:33] you really trust god amen he's your
[48:36] savior he's your heel but the devil
[48:38] every day he's trying to you know wiggle
[48:40] his stuff into your life and have you
[48:42] doing stuff that he meant ungodly stuff
[48:45] things that wrong things that but i said
[48:48] death has been
[48:50] amen the devil is defeated amen but you
[48:53] got to recognize you got to have enough
[48:55] faith to believe that you don't have to
[48:58] be a sinner you don't have to be doing
[48:59] all of this devilish stuff
[49:01] your flesh love it but you got the
[49:03] doctor of self
[49:05] he said reckon yourself to be dead under
[49:08] sin but alive unto righteousness
[49:12] amen you got to want to die amen for
[49:15] jesus sake
[49:16] amen because he's got something better
[49:19] for me
[49:20] amen the resurrection is for me
[49:24] the rapture is mine i want it
[49:27] praise god i need
[49:28] jesus praise god hallelujah
[49:32] it don't matter what the world gives you
[49:34] it won't satisfy your soul
[49:36] amen it'll only last for a little season
[49:40] but the word can't find place in some
[49:42] folk because they don't want the word
[49:45] amen
[49:46] they like amen they said away with him
[49:48] crucify him kill him amen that's what
[49:51] folks are saying to the word today i
[49:54] can't live it i don't want it i want sin
[49:58] they said give us barabbas
[50:00] we'll take the rabbits give me barabbas
[50:03] that's what i want don't give me jesus
[50:06] you want a murderer in his place
[50:09] amen crucify jesus and that's what we
[50:12] say to the word the word comes to give
[50:15] us peace joy and happiness but we don't
[50:17] want it we believe the devil will have
[50:20] pledge and sin for a season
[50:24] are you a man don't let the devil fool
[50:27] you
[50:28] don't let the green grass fool you
[50:31] don't let the devil lie to you and make
[50:33] you a sinner
[50:36] when salvation is free
[50:38] in whom the sun set free is free indeed
[50:43] there's a life right here for you
[50:46] amen where the spirit of the lord is
[50:48] there's a liberty
[50:50] praise god i'm so glad god saved me
[50:53] i don't feel that like i missed out on
[50:56] nothing some young folk think they're
[50:58] missing out on life but i'm missing out
[51:00] on
[51:01] death
[51:02] praise god because then
[51:04] nothing good
[51:05] no good thing
[51:07] that the devil could offer you
[51:10] amen all good and perfect gifts
[51:13] come from above
[51:15] are you with me
[51:18] that's why paul said that it
[51:20] in me that is in my flesh dwellings
[51:23] no good thing are you with me
[51:26] so i'm a no good thing
[51:30] how about you
[51:32] i'm a no good thing
[51:36] he said well uh and that's what's the
[51:38] matter
[51:39] we want to we want self glory
[51:41] that's why we're medicine or humble
[51:43] yourself you know it's got to be a cross
[51:45] before there got to be a death before
[51:47] there's the resurrection
[51:49] somebody got to die amen if you want a
[51:51] resurrection
[51:52] something got to be dead so you got to
[51:54] die to yourself not of your will not my
[51:56] will but let your will be done in my
[51:57] life
[51:58] you got to want it now you got to want
[52:00] it it just can't be something that i
[52:03] come and listen to the word and come to
[52:05] church but i got to amen it's got to
[52:07] come down in my soul it's got to be
[52:10] something bubbling amen that's why david
[52:12] said that word have i what
[52:14] i hear in my heart that i might not what
[52:18] oh god amen something that's real inside
[52:20] me something that's alive the word of
[52:22] god is quick it's powerful it's alive
[52:26] sharpening it is true as the sword i got
[52:28] something that's real
[52:30] amen i got god that even he started me
[52:32] he brought about a change in my life
[52:34] amen yes i was wicked yes i was a sinner
[52:37] yes i did wrong things but thank god he
[52:39] saved me
[52:41] i'm glad to be saved
[52:44] amen i'm glad i got seen when i was a
[52:46] young man
[52:48] amen
[52:50] he could have let me drown
[52:52] amen
[52:53] but love lifted me
[52:56] but he could have let me drown
[52:58] how about you brother sister do you feel
[52:59] like he could have let you cry
[53:02] amen but instead
[53:05] amen
[53:06] i'm so glad he picked me up
[53:12] see brother and sister we got to take
[53:14] advantage of god's grace for us and what
[53:17] he says suffering is dying and let it
[53:19] not be in vain amen but
[53:22] it can't register it can't ratchet to
[53:24] the because the lord have mercy i wish i
[53:27] could say it like i want to say it but
[53:29] i'm in the pulpit i can't say it amen
[53:31] but some kind of way not not no natural
[53:34] sense but spiritual understanding got to
[53:36] come in somebody because somebody amen
[53:39] has locked jesus out of their life and
[53:42] they won't listen to parents they won't
[53:44] listen to god and god trying to talk to
[53:46] them and they can't hear god's voice
[53:49] they're not listening to god i'm saying
[53:52] somebody ought to hear god
[53:59] by
[54:02] man came also the resurrection of dead
[54:04] 22 says for in what
[54:07] for in adam all died
[54:09] are you with me
[54:11] we were born like i said again we were
[54:13] born in sin shaping any nicotine sin
[54:15] that our mother conceded us amen so we
[54:17] all born sinners
[54:19] somebody said well you
[54:20] you wasn't born a liar yes she was you
[54:23] wasn't born this way that way i and i
[54:25] don't you know people say well
[54:28] oh they were born like that some folks
[54:30] are
[54:31] all kind of things people were born like
[54:33] that it was the nature that was in their
[54:35] parents came in them and then it might
[54:38] have skipped over it wasn't in their
[54:40] parents but it was in their grandparents
[54:42] and it skipped over somebody dropped on
[54:44] somebody you see certain spirits run
[54:46] through families
[54:48] those spirits run through families
[54:50] because those a generation generational
[54:51] curses
[54:52] and they run amen it might jump over
[54:55] somebody it might be a whole family and
[54:57] it might catch two or three and you know
[55:00] so a lot of times things happen
[55:03] and you say wonder why somebody's you
[55:06] know
[55:07] i tell people the things that you do it
[55:09] may not affect you but it could affect
[55:11] your children
[55:14] because they asked a blind man who in my
[55:16] parents who sinned this man or his
[55:18] parents are you with me
[55:21] so
[55:22] sometimes the things that we go through
[55:25] amen we're not going through because
[55:27] it's something we've done it's something
[55:28] somebody else done but we got to go
[55:30] through it
[55:32] that's why it's good for us to be saved
[55:34] and do the right thing and live the
[55:35] right way because our children might be
[55:37] suffering because of something we've
[55:39] done
[55:41] are you with me
[55:42] so the choices that you make you need to
[55:45] make the right choice if you want to be
[55:46] a blessing to your children don't say
[55:49] you you can say well i'm going to leave
[55:50] them so many thousands
[55:53] maybe a quarter of a million dollars but
[55:56] leave them
[55:57] leave them a life
[55:59] a life that you live
[56:01] where the blessings of god will be on
[56:04] abraham and his seed after him amen on
[56:07] his children children
[56:09] command blessings
[56:11] amen
[56:13] praise god command blessings uh amen i'm
[56:16] gonna bless abraham and i'm a blessed
[56:18] seed because i know he would
[56:21] teach his children he would guide his
[56:23] children right
[56:26] are you with me
[56:27] so i'm gonna bless him and i'm a blessed
[56:29] seed amen
[56:31] amen thank god for godly parents and
[56:34] godly amen grandmamas and granddads and
[56:37] people that would guide you in the right
[56:39] way amen
[56:41] amen so you might be living off somebody
[56:43] else's inheritance
[56:45] amen the only reason god having mercy on
[56:47] you because somebody else prayed
[56:49] somebody said my mama prayed for me
[56:52] had me on a mine
[56:54] took the time and prayed for me
[56:57] amen
[56:58] it says
[56:59] for an adam all died so i didn't have a
[57:01] choice it didn't do it no i didn't do it
[57:05] somebody said i wouldn't ate up that
[57:06] tree
[57:07] it was too late now
[57:09] amen you didn't need but you got to pay
[57:11] for it
[57:12] because you're born that way
[57:15] but god didn't leave us like that
[57:19] as he gave them free moral asian
[57:22] and they could
[57:23] choose
[57:24] life for death they chose death
[57:27] are you open
[57:29] then you can choose life or death you
[57:31] can choose whether you want to be a
[57:32] christian when you want to live for god

[1:04:06] he says
[1:04:08] in christ shall all be made alive
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:12] so so by the grace of god i want to drop
[1:04:15] down
[1:04:16] uh too
[1:04:18] and adam all died and in christ should
[1:04:20] all be made alive
[1:04:21] and he says here in uh
[1:04:26] the 24th verse
[1:04:28] then 24th first then come at the end
[1:04:32] when he shall have delivered up
[1:04:34] the kingdom to god
[1:04:36] even the father
[1:04:38] and when he shall have put down all
[1:04:42] rules and all authority and all pop
[1:04:46] for he must reign till he has
[1:04:48] put all what
[1:04:51] all enemies
[1:04:52] where i'm gonna tell you something
[1:04:56] christ must reign he's reigning now
[1:04:59] he's reigning in my life
[1:05:01] until he has put all enemies under his
[1:05:04] feet
[1:05:05] amen then in the 26th verse he said
[1:05:09] do what
[1:05:12] i said
[1:05:15] the resurrection shows that death has
[1:05:17] been what
[1:05:19] the last enemy
[1:05:20] that shall be destroyed is what
[1:05:23] death spiritually amen
[1:05:26] you died spiritually
[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:29] and you made a lie
[1:05:31] by the baptism of the holy ghost isn't
[1:05:33] that right
[1:05:34] but this flesh here this last enemy
[1:05:38] because he still is a wall going on
[1:05:39] isn't that right
[1:05:41] your flesh amen
[1:05:43] there's a battle there's a wall going on
[1:05:46] the greatest battle ever fought you're
[1:05:47] still fighting am i right but the last
[1:05:50] enemy amen no more this flesh is going
[1:05:53] to fool you deceive you or try to come
[1:05:55] against you amen this flesh wants you to
[1:05:59] want to be pacified it won't be
[1:06:01] nourished it wants to feed on the things
[1:06:03] of the devil because why it was a
[1:06:06] disobedient spirit that brought this
[1:06:09] flesh into being
[1:06:10] amen that's why amen it only it's going
[1:06:13] to be around here for a season for a
[1:06:15] little while
[1:06:16] amen so this flesh here amen this body
[1:06:20] of flesh amen
[1:06:22] so it's going to be around here and it's
[1:06:25] going to as long as we
[1:06:26] have this this body amen as you know
[1:06:30] there's a natural man and there's a
[1:06:32] spiritual man
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:35] he said put on the new man
[1:06:39] and put off
[1:06:41] oh man so there's spirits that goes that
[1:06:44] the old man lives off of
[1:06:46] amen their spirit what in the last days
[1:06:49] they'd be lovers of themselves they'd be
[1:06:52] truth breakers they'd be haters you know
[1:06:55] one another and they'll be
[1:06:58] oh god
[1:06:59] oh the works of the flesh of these
[1:07:02] i can get into galatians and so forth
[1:07:04] and deal with the works of the flesh but
[1:07:06] the works of the flesh
[1:07:08] it's all these things those things come
[1:07:10] with
[1:07:11] sin and come with the fall come with the
[1:07:13] old man
[1:07:15] people when you've got an old man on
[1:07:17] you're gonna you're gonna lie you're
[1:07:18] gonna steal you're gonna cheat you're
[1:07:20] gonna commit fornication you're gonna
[1:07:21] commit adultery you're gonna do all kind
[1:07:23] of unknowled stuff because that's the
[1:07:25] workshop of the flesh
[1:07:27] and when you walk in the flesh you're
[1:07:29] going to do the works of the flesh
[1:07:31] you're going to try to please the flesh
[1:07:33] but if you walk in the spirit you're
[1:07:35] going to try to please the things that
[1:07:36] be of god
[1:07:38] are you with me
[1:07:39] so when you
[1:07:41] when there's flesh die then you're no
[1:07:43] longer trying to please the flesh
[1:07:45] you're not trying to
[1:07:47] when the old man died and been crucified
[1:07:49] with christ then you want the new man to
[1:07:51] live
[1:07:53] are you with me
[1:07:54] then you want to please god is that
[1:07:56] simplified
[1:07:58] do we understand that
[1:08:00] but you it's got to come down in you as
[1:08:02] a will and i won't
[1:08:05] you got the will and want this
[1:08:07] you got to want god amen you got to
[1:08:10] realize the devil is your
[1:08:13] enemy
[1:08:14] he's your wife
[1:08:16] he's your enemy do you believe that
[1:08:19] shake somebody's hand asked me do you
[1:08:20] believe the devil is your enemy
[1:08:26] because i don't believe you that he you
[1:08:28] you call him friend
[1:08:31] amen but the devil is your enemy
[1:08:35] amen
[1:08:36] the last enemy
[1:08:38] what caused sin sin you can't love
[1:08:40] sinning
[1:08:42] if you love sin then you love you the
[1:08:44] devil
[1:08:45] because that's what eve amen
[1:08:48] she trusted in what the devil said and
[1:08:50] then
[1:08:51] versus what god had said
[1:08:54] he said yeah he has god said and then he
[1:08:56] said god know you're gonna know good and
[1:08:58] evil
[1:09:00] and the day you eat of you you won't die
[1:09:03] and that's what the devil tells you all
[1:09:05] the time you'll get right you're going
[1:09:07] to have your fun now you young you you
[1:09:10] this your dad
[1:09:12] and a lot of times
[1:09:14] he gets over on us
[1:09:15] i know he got over on me
[1:09:18] the devil the devil really fooled me
[1:09:21] until god opened my eyes
[1:09:25] and i i believe every young person in
[1:09:27] here want to be saved and want to go to
[1:09:29] heaven
[1:09:30] but the devil he'll talk your idea of
[1:09:32] this
[1:09:33] he talked eve in the yeah yeah you see
[1:09:36] you see she said yeah i see it it's good
[1:09:40] it's blessed to die
[1:09:41] oh yeah
[1:09:42] you know
[1:09:43] and that's what the devil does
[1:09:45] he gets you with the eyes he'll get you
[1:09:47] with
[1:09:48] you know facebook and
[1:09:51] instagram
[1:09:52] i don't know what i'm talking about but
[1:09:54] you know what i'm talking about y'all
[1:09:56] know what he'd get you with
[1:09:57] and he'll woo you and he'll grab you
[1:10:01] make you feel like you know you
[1:10:03] important
[1:10:05] what's the devil get through with you
[1:10:07] you know what i'm saying and mess your
[1:10:09] life up and then you say oh lord i'm
[1:10:12] sorry
[1:10:13] get sorry now
[1:10:16] don't wait till the devil doesn't mess
[1:10:17] you all up
[1:10:19] defeat and then all of a sudden lord
[1:10:21] help me jesus
[1:10:23] the lord already done died for your sins
[1:10:29] he's already gave you a way of escape
[1:10:32] so
[1:10:34] why
[1:10:35] why let the devil beat you up
[1:10:38] when you can serve god
[1:10:40] most of our troubles is we won't make
[1:10:42] the right decision
[1:10:44] most of our problems that we go through
[1:10:47] is that we won't make the right decision
[1:10:49] things will be so much easier and god
[1:10:51] will give you so much
[1:10:53] better understanding for life and for
[1:10:54] yourself and god would help you to be
[1:10:58] even standing together
[1:11:00] and be a witness once you free and once
[1:11:02] you love god then you want others to
[1:11:04] know the love of god and know the peace
[1:11:06] that you have and the joy that you have
[1:11:09] but when you when you kind of holding
[1:11:11] back and you can't tell others that amen
[1:11:14] that god jesus is the answer look at
[1:11:17] you know i i just believe if young
[1:11:19] people just really told people that you
[1:11:21] know the lord loved them that they
[1:11:24] wouldn't turn to gang violence they
[1:11:25] wouldn't turn to this they won't turn to
[1:11:27] that it's because they're winning
[1:11:29] satisfied with god
[1:11:31] if you're not excited to invite with god
[1:11:33] then how can you bring somebody else to
[1:11:35] the lord
[1:11:37] you can't bring them to the lord and
[1:11:38] lessen you because these
[1:11:41] oh but
[1:11:43] through the prize of
[1:11:45] of others sometimes you protect it
[1:11:50] but it's time when you wake up
[1:11:54] because if you keep
[1:11:57] just drifting drifting
[1:11:59] you drift too far after a while
[1:12:02] okay last enemy
[1:12:05] that shall be destroyed is death
[1:12:09] are you with me
[1:12:11] for he has put all things under his feet
[1:12:15] but when he says
[1:12:18] all things are put unto him
[1:12:20] it is manifested that he
[1:12:23] is what
[1:12:25] accepted
[1:12:26] which did put all things under him
[1:12:30] and when
[1:12:31] all things shall be subdued unto him
[1:12:36] then shall the son also
[1:12:39] himself be subject unto him that put all
[1:12:43] things unto him
[1:12:45] that god
[1:12:47] may be what
[1:12:50] all in all
[1:12:52] okay i'm gonna skip over some things
[1:12:54] let's go to the
[1:12:56] 51st verse
[1:12:58] it says
[1:13:00] behold i show you a mystery
[1:13:03] we should not all sleep and that means
[1:13:04] we all won't stay in the grave we should
[1:13:07] not all sleep but we shall be what
[1:13:10] change we should not all die we do not
[1:13:13] all sleep
[1:13:14] you said my our friend ladders is
[1:13:16] sleeping and
[1:13:18] and the disciples said
[1:13:20] if he sleep lord he do as well he said
[1:13:23] ladarius is dead
[1:13:26] and i'm going to awake him
[1:13:28] that's what jesus told him isn't that
[1:13:30] right
[1:13:31] and it got there it was four days
[1:13:33] and ladders was stinking in the grave
[1:13:36] but jesus said ladders is sleeping
[1:13:39] you re that's why he said whosoever
[1:13:41] believed in him should never die we
[1:13:43] don't die
[1:13:45] we just sleep
[1:13:48] and the thing is when so you may have a
[1:13:50] funeral and
[1:13:51] you know home going or whatever it's
[1:13:53] just because in this life here we won't
[1:13:56] see them we won't be able to fellowship
[1:13:58] with them right now but they sleeping
[1:14:02] and they'll be in a better place because
[1:14:03] they just went to sleep for a little
[1:14:05] while but you can join them
[1:14:08] amen
[1:14:09] you join them if they live for god and
[1:14:11] they trusted god and they gave jesus
[1:14:13] christ their life
[1:14:15] then you can see them again
[1:14:17] are you with me
[1:14:18] but if you don't you'll never see them
[1:14:20] again
[1:14:22] are you with me
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:29] you know
[1:14:30] i wonder who said that to me i'm trying
[1:14:32] to think somebody says
[1:14:35] that
[1:14:37] okay let me go and i can't remember the
[1:14:40] story
[1:14:41] he says in in a moment
[1:14:44] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:14:45] that's how fast it's going to be
[1:14:48] but
[1:14:48] in order for god to change us in the
[1:14:50] moment in the twinkling of an eye we're
[1:14:52] going to have to have the holy ghost
[1:14:54] we're going to have to have the
[1:14:55] quickening power if you ain't got it
