[8:28] [Music]
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. At this time, we have sisters
[8:32] going to give us a song.
[8:46] Let's
[8:51] [Music]
[8:56] go.
[9:02] Let's go.
[9:23] No matter how I sing
[9:27] to the natural mind,
[9:31] no one hammered away.
[9:35] Yes, he hammered away.
[9:39] No matter what people say
[9:44] in that day and that time
[9:47] [Music]
[9:49] have it all way.
[9:51] Yes, he have it all way.
[9:55] So you got to rise above
[10:00] this earthly place.
[10:04] You are the living holy soul and not be
[10:10] ashamed.
[10:12] You are the light
[10:15] of God as I work
[10:20] and only believe
[10:24] in Jesus name.
[10:29] and only believe
[10:32] in Jesus name.
[10:37] No matter how people laugh
[10:42] and that prophet of God,
[10:45] he still hammered away.
[10:49] Yet he hammered away
[10:53] because of their arel.
[10:58] They could not be saved. But Noah
[11:03] hammered away.
[11:06] Yet he hammered away.
[11:10] So you got to rise above
[11:15] this earthly place.
[11:18] You got to live the light of the world
[11:23] and not be ashamed.
[11:27] You must apply the gun as God's word pro
[11:34] and only believe
[11:38] in Jesus name.
[11:43] and only believe
[11:47] in Jesus name.
[11:51] No matter how people laugh
[11:56] at that prophet of God,
[12:00] he still hammered away.
[12:03] Yes, he hammered away
[12:07] because of their unbelief.
[12:12] We could not be saved. But Noah hammered
[12:17] away.
[12:20] Yes, he hammered away.
[12:24] So you got to rise above
[12:29] this earthly place.
[12:32] You got to live this voice of God's
[12:36] world and not be ashamed.
[12:40] You multiply
[12:42] the token
[12:44] as God's word proclaimed
[12:48] and only believe
[12:52] in Jesus name.
[12:56] and only believe
[13:00] in Jesus name.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; And at this time we ask that the powers
[13:17] to come give us a song.
[13:21] [Music]
[13:36] All my worth fall short.
[13:42] I've got nothing new.
[13:47] How could I express
[13:52] all my gratitude?
[13:57] I could sing these songs
[14:02] as I often do,
[14:07] but every song must end
[14:13] and you never do.
[14:17] And so I throw my hands and praise you
[14:22] again and again.
[14:26] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.
[14:34] Hallelu.
[14:38] And I know it's not much, but I'm
[14:42] nothing fit for a king.
[14:46] Except for our singing hallelujah.
[15:03] And I want
[15:08] the word
[15:11] [Music]
[15:13] with my arms stretch.
[15:17] I will worship you.
[15:22] So I bow my hands to praise you again
[15:27] and again.
[15:30] All that I have
[15:43] Ever.
[15:48] [Music]
[16:06] [Music]
[16:11] So calm my soul. Oh, don't you get shy
[16:15] of me of your throne. You got a lion
[16:20] inside of the ground. Give up and praise
[16:25] the Lord.
[16:30] Oh my god.
[16:36] [Music]
[16:42] Give me praise the Lord.
[16:49] And all the earth will adore me.
[16:54] Will
[16:56] the father will be free.
[17:07] All the earth will
[17:13] [Music]

[18:02] Oh my go
[18:23] again. again.

[18:42] for me.

[19:05] Hallelujah.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; This time we lift up the offering. Amen.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.

[25:16] Oh, and I can walk from there.
[25:20] Oh, and it's a highway
[25:23] to heaven.
[25:26] talking of the king highway.
[25:33] Amen. It's a highway to heaven. Amen.
[25:36] Let us stand at this time. Amen.
[25:43] Let us bow.
[25:46] Lord Jesus, we thank you for allowing us
[25:48] to be in your house one more time. Lord,
[25:51] we want to walk up the King's Highway
[25:53] tonight. And Lord, we want to grow
[25:54] closer to you and get give you all the
[25:57] glory, all the honor, and all the
[25:59] praise. And Lord, we ask that you move
[26:01] tonight in a mighty and a special way.
[26:03] Move us out of the way that you may get
[26:05] all the glory and all the honor and all
[26:07] the praise. Lord, meet every need that's
[26:09] here and every need that's listening
[26:11] tonight. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[26:14] [Music]
[26:17] Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[26:18] we'll turn to the book of Job, chapter
[26:21] 1, a very familiar scripture.
[26:26] [Applause]
[26:44] Job chapter 1 and we'll start in verse
[26:50] verse 6.
[26:52] You got it. Say amen.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; And it reads, "Now there was a day when
[26:57] the son of when the sons of God came to
[27:00] present themselves before the Lord, and
[27:02] Satan came also among them. And the Lord
[27:05] said unto Satan, Whencece comest thou?"
[27:09] Then Satan answered the Lord, and said,
[27:11] "From going to and fro in the earth, and
[27:14] from walking up and down in it?" And the
[27:17] Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou
[27:19] considered my servant Job, that thou can
[27:22] is that there is none like him in the
[27:26] earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
[27:29] that fearth God and excuseth evil?" Then
[27:32] Satan answered the Lord and said, "Dust
[27:34] Job fear God for not? Hast not thou hast
[27:39] not thou made a hedge about him and
[27:42] about his house and about all that he
[27:44] hath on every side? Thou hast blessed
[27:49] the work of his hands and his abundance
[27:51] in in an increased in the land and is
[27:55] increased in the land and his substance
[27:58] is increased in the land. Amen. But put
[28:01] forth thine hand now and touch all that
[28:03] he hath and he will curse thee to thy
[28:06] face. And the Lord said unto ha to
[28:09] Satan, behold, all that he hath is in
[28:12] thy power. All only upon himself put not
[28:16] forth thine hand. So Satan went forth
[28:19] from the presence of the Lord. Amen. God
[28:22] bless the reading of his word. You may
[28:23] be seated.
[28:28] Tonight I'd like to speak on a little
[28:30] topic that I entitled, "Can God have
[28:33] confidence in you?"
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Can God have confidence in you? And the
[28:37] prophet of God, I was reading about it
[28:39] and and and he and he said, he said,
[28:42] "Then Satan, the accuser, come up and
[28:44] said it before God." And he said, "Have
[28:46] you considered my servant Job a just
[28:49] man, a perfect man? There's none like
[28:51] him in the whole earth." Think of it.
[28:53] None like him in the whole earth. And he
[28:56] said, "Sure, you got a hedge around him,
[28:58] and that man has got everything. Good
[29:00] health, good strength, and plenty of
[29:02] money, and plenty of everything. Sure,
[29:05] he can serve you." But he said, "Let let
[29:08] me have him a few minutes, and I'll sure
[29:10] take him apart, and I'll make him curse
[29:12] you to your face."
[29:15] But this is the point that I I was
[29:16] reading and it stood out to me. He said,
[29:18] "Now notice, oh, I love this. God
[29:20] knowing the heart.
[29:23] Job had only one way and that's through
[29:26] fellowship. Through the shedding of
[29:28] blood, he had talked to God and he know
[29:31] that he was God had confidence in Job
[29:34] because he had had fellowship with Job.
[29:38] And I thought about it and I was like,
[29:40] can God have confidence in you in such a
[29:43] way? God has such confidence in Job. He
[29:46] said, you devil, you can take everything
[29:48] from him except for his life. He had
[29:51] such confidence in Job because he had
[29:53] had such fellowship with Job. He knew
[29:55] that Job would never leave no matter
[29:57] what. He knew that Job would never doubt
[30:00] no matter what because Job had a real
[30:02] relationship with God. Job had such a
[30:04] strong relationship with God. He knew
[30:06] that nothing the devil could do to
[30:08] dissuade Job from believing that God was
[30:11] still real, that God was still a
[30:13] deliverer, that God was still a savior,
[30:15] God was still a healer, God was still
[30:17] able to do exceedingly abundantly more
[30:19] than he ever thought or could think.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Because of Joe's relationship with God.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking about it and I said,
[30:27] "Can God have the same confidence in
[30:30] Job?
[30:31] Can he have it in you?" Mhm.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; See, he see it was such a it was such a
[30:37] testimony. Job was such a testimony that
[30:40] the devil had to go to God and say,
[30:41] "Lord, I got to do something about
[30:43] this." Because this is such a testimony
[30:46] of what God can do.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Job was a living testimony of what God
[30:51] could do. He was a living testimony that
[30:53] God can bless you exceedingly
[30:55] abundantly. He was a living testimony
[30:57] that God could give you give you a great
[31:00] family. That God could bless you with
[31:02] with good health. God could bless you
[31:04] with a good environment. God could bless
[31:06] you with good friends. What Job so
[31:08] thought at that time. But it was he was
[31:11] a living testimony of what God could do.
[31:14] And I wonder sometimes uh when people
[31:17] come and when people come and they have
[31:19] a need, will God send them your way?
[31:22] Bless
[31:23] &gt;&gt; because God has confidence that you're
[31:25] going to lead them in the right way.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; I wonder if he he'll say, you know, go
[31:29] talk to that person while you're going
[31:31] through because God has confidence that
[31:33] you're going to point them in the right
[31:34] direction.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; God has confidence that when they see
[31:37] you, they see him. They God has
[31:40] confidence that you have such a
[31:42] relationship with him that when when
[31:44] when they come to you, you lead them to
[31:46] him.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; See, that's the difference. Job. He
[31:49] didn't turn away from his belief in God.
[31:52] It didn't matter. And see, he got so
[31:54] personal to Job that the devil tried
[31:56] everything he could. He even used the
[31:58] closest persons to him, which was his
[32:00] wife, his wife. And he said, "You, Job,
[32:03] you you everything has been taken from
[32:05] you. Why don't you just curse your God
[32:07] and die?" Just imagine if your closest
[32:10] friend or your parents told you you
[32:12] don't need to believe in that God
[32:14] anymore. That God can't do nothing for
[32:16] you. Just imagine that. But Job had such
[32:20] a relationship with God that he said he
[32:23] told her to to go somewhere with that
[32:25] foolishness because it it was such a
[32:28] real thing to him, his relationship with
[32:30] God. He said, "Lord, though you slay me,
[32:32] yet I trust you."
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; See, that's when you got a different
[32:36] experience with God, that nothing can
[32:38] persuade you or dissuade you that God is
[32:41] real. That God is real to you, not to
[32:44] anybody else. You have to have that
[32:46] experience with him.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; And you have to understand that even
[32:50] though the test and trial may get hard,
[32:52] Lord, I can still stand firm on your
[32:54] word. I can still believe. I can still
[32:56] trust that you're going to do what you
[32:58] said you would do.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; And even if you don't do it, you still
[33:02] been good enough to me that I can still
[33:04] trust you no matter what.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; He said God had confidence in Job
[33:08] because he had had fellowship with Job.
[33:11] And I think about it and I said, "How
[33:13] many times do we have do we spend time
[33:15] with God so that we can have fellowship
[33:18] with God? So that we can get that
[33:20] communion with God that he not only we
[33:22] not only talk to him, but he talks back
[33:24] to us. That we not only see him in the
[33:27] morning, we see him all throughout the
[33:29] day. That we see God walking with us and
[33:31] that hedges around us. That we recognize
[33:33] that God has sent his angels to protect
[33:35] us, to surround us, and he's he's doing
[33:38] his work each and every day. You see,
[33:41] when God God has confidence in you, he
[33:43] sends his presence around you because he
[33:46] realizes that you can't do anything cuz
[33:48] you realize I can't do anything without
[33:51] you, Lord. I can't do anything without
[33:53] you leading me, without you guiding me,
[33:55] without you ordering my steps.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; I can't do anything cuz Lord, I have
[34:00] such high confidence in you that he
[34:02] said, "I I'll pour out my spirit within
[34:04] you." See, see, he he wants a willing
[34:07] vessel that's going to come and say,
[34:09] "Lord, I give you everything."
[34:12] &gt;&gt; And said, and I read further, and he
[34:14] said, he said, "The only way that God
[34:17] can have confidence in you is not
[34:20] because you do something or with your
[34:23] faith you do something, but but when you
[34:26] have fellowship, when you have
[34:28] fellowship with God." And see, God wants
[34:31] to say, I want to have confidence in you
[34:33] so that I can take you higher, so that I
[34:36] can take you on the greater things. You
[34:38] if if you're still on the little silly
[34:41] things, well, still getting upset with
[34:42] people because they said something about
[34:44] you. At certain point, you have to
[34:47] realize that people just going to say
[34:48] what they want to say.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; And then you have to go on about your
[34:51] life, whether it whether it's good or
[34:54] bad, you have to go on because that's
[34:56] not that can't be the thing that hinders
[34:58] you from going to heaven. That can't be
[35:00] the thing that is going to stop you from
[35:01] getting in because you holding something
[35:03] against someone and you won't forgive
[35:06] them because they did something without
[35:08] even sometimes unintentionally knowing
[35:10] that it hurt you.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; And you and sometimes you just got to
[35:13] say, you know what, I have to grow to a
[35:16] a a place that I can go ahead and let
[35:18] that go.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; I have to I said the Lord has been
[35:21] working with me in my life and just
[35:23] understanding that sometimes you have to
[35:25] let people go and it's not that you have
[35:27] something against the person. It's a
[35:29] growth thing.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; It's when you grow and you understand
[35:32] that not all things are supposed to be
[35:34] for forever. It's just a season.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; See, if the leaves were to never change,
[35:39] sometimes you would never realize that
[35:41] they could change different colors. But
[35:43] when when you realize that the there's
[35:46] in order for there to be light, there
[35:47] has to be death.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; In order for there to be light, there
[35:50] has to be death. And sometimes you got
[35:52] to you got to die to yourself. You got
[35:55] to die daily. And you got to say, "Lord,
[35:57] I need you to help me so that you can
[35:59] take this part away from me so that I
[36:02] can grow. So that I can grow. I can grow
[36:04] closer to you." Because maybe this right
[36:06] here is a stumbling block, is a
[36:08] hindrance from me growing closer to you.
[36:11] So if it's something that's going to
[36:12] hinder me from growing closer to you,
[36:14] Lord, take it away from me.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Because I want to be so close to you
[36:19] that I'm just like you. When people see
[36:21] me, they see you. When people hear me,
[36:24] they hear you. when they hear my
[36:26] conversation, they realize that there's
[36:28] something different about my
[36:29] conversation.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; There has to be a difference between you
[36:32] and the world.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Because God and the devil are not the
[36:36] same.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; They're the total opposites of each
[36:39] other. So if there's no difference
[36:41] between you and the world, then I ask
[36:43] you to examine yourself.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; If people are comfortable around you, I
[36:48] ask you to examine yourself because
[36:50] sometimes even though you you may be
[36:52] with them, you're not like them. Amen.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; And sometimes they don't feel absolutely
[36:57] comfortable having every conversation,
[37:00] doing everything when they're around
[37:01] you, when when that presence is there.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it it'll cause people to not
[37:06] drink around you. It'll cause people to
[37:08] not smoke around you. It'll cause people
[37:11] to change their their vernacular, their
[37:13] language when they're around you just
[37:15] because that he's there with you.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And see, I I started to think
[37:20] about it and understand that there
[37:22] there's a separation that sometime God
[37:24] has you to go through and you have to
[37:26] understand that Lord, when I come to
[37:28] this place, I got to let your will be
[37:30] done.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; And sometimes that's a hard thing to do
[37:34] because you're holding on to this or
[37:36] you're holding on to that or you're
[37:37] holding on to this person or this person
[37:39] is fulfilling this. But when God does a
[37:42] thing, he doesn't take away a thing
[37:43] without giving you better. Uh-huh.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; He doesn't take away a thing without
[37:47] showing you that I have another way that
[37:49] I want you to go.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; But but if you continue down the road
[37:53] that you holding on to this, you'll
[37:55] never understand where I'm trying to
[37:56] take you. You will never understand what
[37:58] I'm trying to do. I want to take you to
[38:01] a higher level that I can have more
[38:02] confidence in you than I have right now.
[38:05] I want to take you to a higher level
[38:07] that I can trust you with more than I
[38:08] trust you with right now. I want to take
[38:11] you higher so that I can allow you to to
[38:13] to have more a closer walk with me so
[38:17] that I can give you more than what I'm
[38:18] giving you right now.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we haven't had our prayers
[38:22] answered because we're not willing to
[38:24] give up things.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; We're not willing to let some things go
[38:28] in order for our prayers to be answered.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you got to say, "Lord, I I
[38:32] I asked you for this, but and Lord, I'm
[38:35] willing to let this go in order to gain
[38:37] what you have for me." Uh-huh.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; And and sometimes it comes in stages,
[38:41] but sometimes the Lord just comes out
[38:43] and plainly tell you, "No, give this
[38:45] up."
[38:48] &gt;&gt; And and the longer that you hold on to
[38:50] it, I told someone, I said, "Sometimes
[38:52] we we hold on to things and we block God
[38:54] blessings that God want to give us
[38:57] &gt;&gt; because we're holding on to it."
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Even though we know that it's not
[39:01] something, it may not even be something
[39:03] bad. It's just something that God wants
[39:05] us to have to have the the mindset that
[39:08] Lord, I'm not willing to hold on to
[39:10] anything to block you from giving what
[39:12] you want to give to me. I was talking to
[39:15] one of my friends recently and and they
[39:17] was and they they said they was praying
[39:19] they was asking the Lord, Lord, what
[39:21] would you want me to do? But in their
[39:23] prayer, they was asking the Lord, Lord,
[39:25] what would you want me to do? But Lord,
[39:26] I I don't want to do this, this, this,
[39:28] and this.
[39:30] And I said, "Man, you defeating the
[39:32] effect of your prayer." Cuz when you go
[39:34] to God, you can't say, "Lord, Lord,
[39:36] whatever you want me to do, I'll do it."
[39:38] And then say, "Lord, but I won't do
[39:39] this, this, this, and this." God may not
[39:41] even call you to do those things that's
[39:43] on your list. But he want you to have
[39:45] the willing heart to say, "Lord,
[39:47] whatever you want me to do, I'll do it."
[39:50] &gt;&gt; So, you can't block God and say, "Lord,
[39:52] whatever you have me to do, Lord, I want
[39:54] to give you my life, but I want to keep
[39:56] this, this, this, and this." because
[39:58] that isn't how God wants you to do it.
[40:00] He wants you to give up everything. He
[40:02] wants you to come to him and say, "Lord,
[40:04] I want I I give up everything so that
[40:07] God can have confidence that you'll be
[40:09] able to stand." When you give it up,
[40:11] he's going to give you strong something
[40:13] stronger inside of you to withstand all
[40:15] the temptation, to withstand all the
[40:17] fiery darts of the wicked. He's going to
[40:19] give that to you.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; But you got to be willing to give it all
[40:23] up. Hey,
[40:25] &gt;&gt; and I thought about it and and I had
[40:27] some other examples and and I thought
[40:29] about Peter and I thought about I said,
[40:33] "Can God have confidence in Peter?" God
[40:36] has such great confidence in Peter. He
[40:38] gave him the keys to the kingdom before
[40:41] he denied him.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; He gave him the keys to the kingdom
[40:47] before Peter went went there and denied
[40:50] him three times that he didn't know the
[40:52] man.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Bless. Bless
[40:53] &gt;&gt; said, "Sometimes, sometimes God has such
[40:56] confidence because sometimes he knows
[40:58] what's in your heart. He knew you before
[41:00] the beginning of time. He knew where you
[41:03] was." And I thought about it and it
[41:04] became powerful to me. I said, "Lord,
[41:06] why did you choose me out of all these
[41:08] people like why did you choose me? You
[41:11] knew all the mistakes I would make. You
[41:13] knew all the things that I would do, but
[41:15] you still had grace and mercy and
[41:17] decided to choose me."
[41:19] And I started thinking about it and it
[41:20] caused tears to come to my eyes because
[41:22] I realized it was nothing that I did. It
[41:25] was nothing that I could do. It was
[41:27] nothing I could say, anything that I
[41:29] could understand. It was all because God
[41:31] chose me
[41:32] &gt;&gt; and said sometimes you don't like the
[41:34] way the thing that he may call you to do
[41:37] because you say, "Well, that's not me or
[41:39] that's not what I want to do." But it's
[41:41] got to be greater than you.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; You got to realize that your purpose is
[41:45] greater than what you want to do. It's
[41:47] greater than what you think you want to
[41:49] do. It's greater than what you dreamed
[41:51] you want to do. It's greater than all of
[41:53] that.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; And sometimes when you're not in the
[41:56] place that God has put you, you'll
[41:58] always be trying and always be suffering
[42:00] and always be like Paul. It's hard to
[42:02] kick against the brick
[42:05] &gt;&gt; because God has something that he wants
[42:07] you to do. He wants to take you and
[42:09] elevate you to a point that he said, "I
[42:11] can have confidence in you. I can I can
[42:14] have confidence that you're going to be
[42:15] able to stand when the trials and tests
[42:17] come. I can have confidence that you're
[42:20] going to be able to overcome when I
[42:21] allow the devil that's going to come. If
[42:23] you are anything like Job, he going to
[42:25] come against you, too. If you are
[42:28] someone that's trying to live right, the
[42:29] devil is going to come to God and say,
[42:31] "Lord, can I test him, too? Lord, you he
[42:34] said that he love you. So, can I test
[42:36] him and see and see and see and see
[42:38] what's going to try him and said there
[42:40] was one time in the Bible the Lord said
[42:42] there was many spirits that came up. I
[42:44] remember the story parts of the story,
[42:46] but you can read it and look it up. But
[42:48] he said the the thing that was going to
[42:49] deceive them was a lion spirit. He
[42:52] allowed a lion spirit to come. And I and
[42:54] I think about it sometimes. Sometimes
[42:56] the thing that you that you think may be
[42:58] your stumbling block may not even be the
[43:00] thing.
[43:01] So many of people they go they go and
[43:03] they have all these guards up and they
[43:05] have all these things up but at
[43:07] somewhere there's a little gate that's
[43:08] still unlocked
[43:10] and that little gate is where the devil
[43:12] slip in and sometimes you got to find
[43:15] you got to go out and search you got to
[43:17] search your perimeter and search your
[43:18] surroundings and figure out where did
[43:20] you let down those bars said sometimes
[43:23] sometimes you you'll find yourself in a
[43:26] place and say man I ain't struggled with
[43:27] that in a long time and I started
[43:29] thinking about it I said, "You know,
[43:31] when something like that happens, that's
[43:32] when you have to examine yourself and
[43:34] say, "Where did I open the gate?"
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; It might have been something simple. It
[43:38] might have been the person. It might
[43:39] have been a thing. But somewhere I open
[43:41] this gate and the devil came in here.
[43:44] And I got to go find First of I got to
[43:46] kick him out. Then I got to go search
[43:47] and make sure that I closed that gate
[43:49] that the devil came through. And I got
[43:51] to make sure that it's fortified and
[43:53] that I'm fortified in that area because
[43:55] the prophet of God said if he attacked
[43:57] you once that he's he can come back and
[43:59] attack you again.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; So many a time you have to stay and make
[44:03] sure that you stay covered under the
[44:05] blood
[44:06] &gt;&gt; and that you are dying daily to them and
[44:08] say Lord I still want you to continue to
[44:11] walk with me. Lord I still want you to
[44:13] continue to lead me. I still want you to
[44:15] continue to guide me. Lord I wake up
[44:17] early in the morning and Lord I want to
[44:19] start my day with you. I want to end my
[44:21] day with you and I want you there all
[44:23] from the beginning of the day to the end
[44:25] of the day because it's nothing like
[44:27] having the presence of God with you
[44:30] &gt;&gt; where you can feel them with you in your
[44:32] room in on your job when you can feel
[44:34] them in your car where you realize the
[44:35] angels of God are riding with you.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; I said I started to think about it and
[44:41] and I said what what is the level of
[44:43] confidence that God has in me?
[44:47] Can Can God trust me to to to stand when
[44:50] the devil comes or or am I always
[44:52] running back and and always falling
[44:56] short or or will there be a time that
[44:58] you overcome
[45:00] and you can stand on Lord you gave me
[45:03] power to overcome and I can stand on
[45:05] Lord when the devil comes again Lord you
[45:07] gave me power to overcome so if you did
[45:10] it once you can do it again cuz you're
[45:12] the same God yesterday and forever so if
[45:15] you did it once and then you can do it
[45:16] again. And that's how your relationship
[45:18] with God grows. That's how your
[45:21] relationship with God, it allows you to
[45:24] grow and you to stand firm and you to
[45:26] gain gain trust with God because you
[45:28] realize that God, he he's dealing in my
[45:31] life. That's right.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; He's working with me individually each
[45:34] and every day. He's talking to me. He's
[45:36] showing me. He's allowing me to see the
[45:38] things that I He He's not only using the
[45:40] pastor, but he's also working in my
[45:42] life. He's also allowing me to see that
[45:45] even though some things to some may be
[45:47] small but it may be great to me
[45:50] &gt;&gt; and and and I started to see it and I
[45:53] started to realize that when God is
[45:55] doing the thing sometimes he just
[45:56] started just like Elijah's servant when
[45:58] he opened his eyes he saw and God is
[46:01] working each and every day in all of our
[46:03] lives but you may not notice it and
[46:06] sometimes you got to be still and know
[46:08] that he is God. You got to stand still
[46:10] and say, "Lord, I want you to show me
[46:12] that I'm cognizant. I'm I'm I'm aware
[46:16] that you're working in my life. That I'm
[46:18] aware that Lord, you're speaking through
[46:20] this one. You're using this one. Lord,
[46:22] you're using that one. You're moving
[46:24] here and you're moving there." And I
[46:25] realized why I didn't go down this road
[46:28] because there was an accident. And I
[46:29] went this way today because I thought it
[46:32] was just me just taking a different
[46:33] route, but it was you allowed me to get
[46:35] to work on time. See, when God starts
[46:38] doing things that you start to
[46:40] understand it's not by power, it's not
[46:41] by might, but it's by his spirit that he
[46:44] allows us to go through things and he
[46:46] covers us. Then you'll realize that
[46:48] Lord, I have such confidence in you that
[46:51] I can stand like Job.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[46:53] &gt;&gt; said, don't ever let someone take the
[46:56] take the take your relationship with
[46:58] God.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Whatever level it is, don't ever let no
[47:01] anyone talk you out of your relationship
[47:03] with God. Don't ever talk let someone
[47:06] talk you out of the testimony and the
[47:08] things that God has done for you when
[47:10] you realize how good God is and the
[47:12] things that he does. You you can stand
[47:15] on those things. You can stand no matter
[47:17] how small or how great they are cuz to
[47:19] you those are things that that allow you
[47:21] to build your faith that allow you to
[47:24] stand on it and they become a testimony
[47:26] of what God can do.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; They become a testimony of how good God
[47:31] is. They become a testimony that God is
[47:34] doing exactly what his word said he
[47:37] would do. He's a he's because there has
[47:39] to be a people that stand on and show
[47:42] that God is the same yesterday, today,
[47:44] and forever. There has to be someone
[47:46] that'll stand up and say, "I'll testify
[47:48] that God is the same yesterday and
[47:50] forever." So if he said, "I'm a healer,"
[47:53] there has to be someone that has been
[47:55] healed, that can testify that God is a
[47:57] healer. If there's someone, if he says,
[47:59] "I'm a savior," there has to be someone
[48:01] that'll testify that God has saved them.
[48:04] If he said, "I fill you with the Holy
[48:06] Ghost," there has to be someone that has
[48:08] the Holy Ghost that can be a proof to
[48:10] show that, "Hey, he's living inside of
[48:12] me. Hey, he talks to me. He walks with
[48:15] me and he goes along with me all the
[48:17] way."
[48:20] And see, and when you realize that I'm
[48:21] that testimony, then you start to walk
[48:24] with a different authority, with a
[48:26] different confidence, because you
[48:27] realize that God is with you. You
[48:29] realize he's standing right there beside
[48:31] you and that he'll never leave you and
[48:33] never forsake you and that he'll be
[48:35] there till the end.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; See, he had that fellowship with God is
[48:40] such so strong with God that God had
[48:43] complete confidence that Job was going
[48:45] to overcome this test. because no matter
[48:47] how long the test was, no matter how
[48:49] long it took for him to overcome, he
[48:51] knew that his faith was not going to
[48:53] waver in God. And said that's what God
[48:55] is trying to elevate us to the point
[48:57] that no matter what comes, no matter
[49:00] what happens, no matter what may stand
[49:02] in our way, there's nothing that's going
[49:04] to take us out of the will of God.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; As long as we believe and we trust him
[49:09] with everything, we have no doubt in
[49:11] him. God is going to prevail all the
[49:13] time. He's going to always overcome.
[49:15] He's always going to allow us to get the
[49:18] victory.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; G.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; See, that's the that's when you realize
[49:23] that Lord, I I'm I'm surrendering in
[49:25] such a way that Lord, I you can have
[49:27] confidence in me cuz I realize how real
[49:30] you are. I realize how real of a God you
[49:33] are and that you and that I will trust
[49:35] you no matter what. I trust you in the
[49:38] good and the bad, in the up and the
[49:40] down. I realize that it's only a
[49:42] temporary situation. It's only a
[49:44] temporary moment. No matter how bad it
[49:46] got, Job said, even though he realized,
[49:50] he said, he said, "Naked I came into
[49:52] this world and naked I shall return. The
[49:54] Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
[49:56] Blessed be the name of the Lord." See,
[49:59] Job got to that point. No matter what
[50:01] happens,
[50:02] &gt;&gt; I trust you.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, I believe I
[50:06] never doubt that you aren't God, that
[50:08] you aren't real, and that you won't do
[50:10] what you said you will do. See, one time
[50:13] eventually the devil lifted off of him
[50:15] and God blessed him with double than
[50:17] what he had before.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; See, that was just a testimony of what
[50:21] God could do. When you get so close to
[50:23] God, you get such a relationship with
[50:25] God. You get such a fellowship with God
[50:28] that you that you talk to him and he
[50:30] talks to you and you commune with him
[50:32] and he communes with you. You'll be just
[50:34] like Adam was in the Garden of Eden when
[50:37] Jesus would come down and he would dwell
[50:39] there and call his name and Adam would
[50:41] go talk to God. And and you see how Adam
[50:44] was, he had authority to name
[50:46] everything, all the animals, all the the
[50:48] plants, the fruit, everything. Cuz God
[50:50] had given him that authority.
[50:53] And he said that he would give us the
[50:55] same thing. But we have to get to that
[50:57] point that Lord, we trust you above all
[50:59] else.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; We trust you above family. We trust you
[51:02] above friends. We trust you above all
[51:05] this thing because we have such a
[51:07] relationship with you that we can trust
[51:09] you no matter what. That Lord, we want
[51:11] you to have complete confidence in us
[51:13] because we have complete confidence in
[51:15] you.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:21] [Music]
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[51:32] We know that all things work together to
[51:35] the good
[51:36] &gt;&gt; to them that love the Lord, to them who
[51:38] have the call according to his purpose.
[51:42] And God has a purpose for each and every
[51:44] one of our lives.
[51:46] Amen. And we want God's will to be done,
[51:50] his purpose to be done in our lives. So
[51:53] it says, "Work out your soul's salvation
[51:55] with fear and trembling." So by the
[51:59] grace of God, Amen. Joe was able to
[52:02] stand when
[52:04] all
[52:06] some people say when all hell broke out
[52:09] against him, Joe still stood.
[52:13] When it he said the gates of hell shall
[52:16] not prevail against you. Amen. So God
[52:22] knows that your revelation in him,
[52:25] praise God, that nothing can shake your
[52:27] faith in God. Lord, I'll stand for you.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Stand fast in the
[52:36] liberty where Christ has made you free
[52:40] and be not again entangled with the yoke
[52:43] of bondage." Are you with me? Amen.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; It's very important that the stand that
[52:49] we take, it must be firm.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; If you stand for him,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; he'll stand for you.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; In that day. Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God's going to stand for
[53:02] you.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God. When it comes to crossing
[53:05] that river,
[53:08] Amen. God will stand there. Amen. He'll
[53:12] welcome you.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on in, good and faithful
[53:16] servant.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Enter into the joy of the Lord. Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; It's good, Amen. that God recognize your
[53:24] faithfulness.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; If you're faithful to him, he'll he's
[53:28] faithful.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; And he will not forget your labor of
[53:32] love
[53:33] &gt;&gt; that you shown towards his name. He'll
[53:36] never forget. Amen. You. Praise God.
[53:42] That's why often times he said when I
[53:44] think about the goodness of Jesus and
[53:48] all that he's done for me my soul cries
[53:51] out hallelujah and I thank God for
[53:55] saving me.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Once you begin to praise God for all his
[53:59] benefits towards
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; then
[54:04] your head will not be down but your head
[54:07] will be lifted up.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said, uh, I'll lift my
[54:12] head up.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Because in the time of trouble, Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; He shall hide me in his prevail.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; In the secrets of his tabernacle shall
[54:23] he hide me. He shall set me up upon a
[54:26] rock,
[54:27] &gt;&gt; and now shall my head be lifted up above
[54:30] my enemies round about me.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I know we serve a God that
[54:34] can lift us up.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; He'll make it all right.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; He'll work it out for you.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; He'll fix it for you.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz he knows how to do it.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You don't have to trust in
[54:55] your own ability. You can trust in the
[54:58] word of God.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; The word of God is quick. It's powerful.
[55:02] It's sharp.
[55:04] Amen. It's gone out of his mouth and it
[55:06] shall Amen. accomplished that when he
[55:09] sent it.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you put the word in your mouth
[55:14] &gt;&gt; and you speak the word in faith
[55:17] &gt;&gt; and you set it out. Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It it will not come back,
[55:22] Lord.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Because it's God's word.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And God said, you said, Lord, I'm saying
[55:28] what you said.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you said you would do it.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; So Lord, you promise to do it. You
[55:36] promise, Lord,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; and I can hold fast
[55:40] &gt;&gt; because God promises will not fail.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; It will not fall to the ground.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; It will come.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; He'll do what he said.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; There is no doubt,
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; If he did it before,
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Jesus,
[56:03] &gt;&gt; he's obligated to do it
[56:06] &gt;&gt; again.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; God does not change his mind about his
[56:10] word.
[56:12] What he did then, he continued to do all
[56:15] the way. It's not a better way.
[56:19] Amen. God only has one way. Praise God.

[57:37] can he have confidence?
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Can God trust us?
[57:45] The question was asked. He had
[57:48] confidence in Job enough to let the
[57:51] devil try him in such such a way. Glory.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Can God trust us? Can he have
[57:59] confidence?

[58:39] failures. Help me tonight
[58:42] &gt;&gt; to stand firm like Job.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Help me to be a real soldier.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Oh God, to fully surrender to your will.

[59:28] I love you. I appreciate you. Thank you.
[59:31] Thank you, Father. May you bless
[59:34] everyone.
[59:36] these that are here tonight, those that
[59:38] are listening in, Lord God, that they
[59:41] can take a firm stand on your word.
[59:45] And Lord God,
[59:47] we're living in a treacherous time and a
[59:49] dark hour.
[59:51] Living in a time, oh God, that oh God,
[59:55] look like everything is falling apart.
[59:57] But God, we looking to you now. We're
[1:00:01] trusting in your ability,
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; God, to keep us, oh God,
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; in this evil age,
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; oh God, protect your children.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, you had angels encamped around
[1:00:18] about Joy. Let your angels encamp around
[1:00:21] about your children, Lord.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:27] We need the angels of God.
[1:00:30] We need you, Lord,
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; to do those things.
[1:00:37] [Music]
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; If you're not saved tonight,
[1:00:41] have you surrendered your heart to the
[1:00:43] Lord? Why don't you tell Jesus,
[1:00:47] "Jesus,
[1:00:49] I want you to come into my life and I
[1:00:52] want to live for you.
[1:00:56] I want to be able to take a stand in the
[1:00:58] school, on the job, and the community,
[1:01:00] Lord, in the family. I want to take a
[1:01:03] stand for you.
[1:01:06] Lord, forgive me, Lord. Give me. Come
[1:01:09] into my life, Lord. I want to live for
[1:01:12] you
[1:01:14] in Jesus name.
[1:01:17] Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:20] Thank him. Thank him. Thank him.
[1:01:23] Amen.
[1:01:24] Amen.
[1:01:28] The Bible says, "Y'all going, huh? Y'all
[1:01:30] in a hurry.
[1:01:33] Thank you, Jesus."
[1:01:35] I want to say
[1:01:38] the Bible said, "Repent,
[1:01:41] be baptized, every one of you, in the
[1:01:42] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:01:45] of sin. You shall receive the gift of
[1:01:46] the Holy Ghost." Remember
[1:01:51] Peter used the keys on the day of
[1:01:53] Pentecost.
[1:01:55] If he used them then
[1:01:57] same keys
[1:02:00] are being used now.
[1:02:04] If you haven't done that, you need to do
[1:02:06] it in Jesus Christ's name. God bless
[1:02:09] you. Thank you.
