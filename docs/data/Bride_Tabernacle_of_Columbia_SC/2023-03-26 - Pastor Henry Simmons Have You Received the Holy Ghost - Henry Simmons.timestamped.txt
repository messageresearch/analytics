[41:28] are possible that he's more than able to
[41:30] do for me
[41:32] praise God far more than the doctors the
[41:35] nurses and I can do for myself amen
[41:39] Hallelujah
[41:41] so I'm trusting God for miracles in my
[41:44] life

[41:47] I thank God God is a keeper you know
[41:50] that
[41:51] as we talk on the Holy Ghost this

[42:00] in Jesus Christ's name and
[42:03] and we thank the Lord and
[42:06] and maybe I'll do this person

[42:13] when we talk about the Holy Ghost we
[42:15] know that there's three stages to Grace
[42:18] and that's justification sanctification
[42:21] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I said
[42:23] three stages of Grace amen
[42:26] Grace is God a favor towards us amen and
[42:31] without God's grace we we have nothing
[42:34] amen we only here by the grace of God
[42:37] there's nothing that we have achieved or
[42:39] done and not because we were so good but
[42:42] it's the grace of God that we're here
[42:44] this morning
[42:45] and it's going to continually be that
[42:48] way it's the grace of God and we thank
[42:50] God for his grace amen no matter how bad
[42:53] our situation may look no matter what
[42:55] we're going through somebody's going
[42:57] through worse than you

[43:22] amen and I love him for it amen
[43:25] so I still trust him and I'm still thank
[43:28] him we always have something to praise
[43:31] the Lord about
[43:33] amen you can look at the things that's
[43:36] coming against it you can look at the
[43:37] Giants you can look at the wall cities
[43:39] or you can look at What God Says
[43:42] and Lord I'm looking at you
[43:45] and what your word has declared for me
[43:48] and Lord I Thank you for saving me
[43:52] salvation means everything

[44:25] you were amen and not intelligent you
[44:28] were is because he loves you
[44:30] God I don't know why he cares I don't
[44:34] know why I sacrificed his life with me
[44:37] but I'm so glad
[44:39] he did
[44:43] where would I be
[44:45] if he did what
[44:47] where would I be if he didn't
[44:50] where would I be
[44:52] we didn't sacrifice
[44:54] life for me how about it brother sister
[44:58] amen
[45:00] take somebody hand and say where would
[45:02] you be
[45:06] amen
[45:07] can you imagine where you would be
[45:10] some of us know where we would have been
[45:13] we would have been bad shape amen
[45:16] but thank God for caring about us
[45:20] now acts 18 and 24.
[45:24] a certain Jew named Apollos
[45:27] born in Alexander
[45:29] an eloquent man and mighty in the world
[45:33] came to emphasis
[45:36] so
[45:37] this man was elegant and mighty in the
[45:40] scripture
[45:42] are you a man
[45:44] see you can always learn
[45:48] somebody can tell you something no
[45:50] matter how powerful how Mighty you are
[45:53] amen somebody can tell you something
[45:57] and they don't have to be so my as
[46:00] eloquent and as mighty as you but yet
[46:03] they can tell you something God can let
[46:05] them reveal to them something that you
[46:09] don't know
[46:10] I understand
[46:12] but you got to be humble enough to
[46:15] accept
[46:16] when God is speaking to somebody else
[46:19] that's why I said let others esteem
[46:22] others better than themselves
[46:25] amen
[46:28] don't look on the things of yourself or
[46:30] things of others
[46:32] amen so he says this man was instructed
[46:37] in the way of the Lord and being fervent
[46:40] in what
[46:41] spirit is Anointed it's ferving in the
[46:44] spirit
[46:45] and he speak and talked diligently the
[46:49] things of the what Lord
[46:51] knowing only the what
[46:55] and see it's a lot of people that know
[46:57] only the baptism of Father Son and Holy
[47:01] Ghost only the titles
[47:03] they when they baptized in the water
[47:05] this is not now baptized in the name of
[47:07] the father's Son and Holy Ghost
[47:10] oh you will
[47:12] they and the eloquent people mean right
[47:18] but they don't know the baptism in the
[47:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:24] they don't know that they should be
[47:26] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:27] Christ
[47:28] yet what they do know amen they really
[47:32] amen are ferving with it
[47:35] amen
[47:36] and suppose
[47:39] Aquila and Priscilla approaches this man
[47:44] okay it's your approach to individuals
[47:47] that turn people off or turn them on
[47:52] is how you approach an individual
[47:55] if you think that you're better and you
[47:58] know more than them and you want to let
[48:00] let me tell you something and amen you
[48:03] ain't nobody don't respect them
[48:06] you got to give respect amen
[48:10] you know not try to embarrass them not
[48:13] try to hey I know something you don't
[48:15] know and you know how it is when you
[48:18] know something somebody don't know amen
[48:21] you think that you you know Head and
[48:23] Shoulders above them
[48:24] maybe you have a college degree maybe
[48:28] you have a master's a doctorate degree
[48:31] maybe you have you know a a job that's
[48:35] highly esteemed maybe you have money or
[48:38] maybe you have something and makes you a
[48:41] little bit amen you can look down on
[48:44] those that don't have as much but this
[48:48] man was an eloquent in description and
[48:50] when you got something that somebody
[48:52] don't have amen subconsciously your
[48:56] spirit could be a little lifted up
[48:59] because you think that you're better
[49:02] than somebody else
[49:04] amen so it's hard for you to understand
[49:07] you know
[49:09] when a man is blind
[49:12] amen you can't make that man see
[49:16] are you with me
[49:17] nothing you you say well that's a white
[49:21] car that's a black card oh that's this
[49:23] is Blue Man blind he can't see can't you
[49:27] see the light is Red Man blind
[49:29] can't you see uh just read this
[49:33] paragraph you can't he can't see
[49:36] and understand if our gospel behead is
[49:40] here to them that are what law ass whom
[49:42] the god in this world has what
[49:45] now if as you can have sympathy and you
[49:49] can have pity on an individual that is
[49:51] physically blind how much more would a
[49:55] spiritual blind person is before you
[49:58] then you should have compassion and
[50:01] understanding how you approach a blind
[50:04] person first of all amen it takes the
[50:07] ability of God to open the blind eyes
[50:10] you cannot
[50:13] amen
[50:14] the darkness make and operate and do
[50:17] what they can but oftentimes they come
[50:20] up they can't open them and same things
[50:22] with our hearts our hearts have to be
[50:26] amen penetrated by the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:30] because there's places inside of us amen
[50:33] that the doctors can't even touch amen
[50:37] because he don't know how to deal with
[50:39] the psychologist can't get it he met the
[50:43] psychiatrist can't get it the counselors
[50:46] and everything so it takes God to deal
[50:49] with your heart and to deal with the
[50:52] soul of man and to look down and to
[50:55] operate that that individual might be
[50:58] able to see or to understand the things
[51:01] of God
[51:02] so if God does not deal with that then
[51:06] that individual would never be able to
[51:08] see are you with me
[51:10] so your approach ought to be with a lot
[51:13] of compassion and a lot of understanding
[51:16] that this person really don't see it
[51:20] doesn't matter how much light amen we
[51:22] can put some more lights in here if a
[51:24] blind person is blind the light won't
[51:27] happen
[51:28] you can pile light upon light polite but
[51:31] if they're blind that light is not going
[51:34] to happen
[51:34] it might cause those that can see the uh
[51:38] see a little better but amen more light
[51:41] won't help a person that's blind
[51:43] first of all their eyes got to be open
[51:48] before they can absolve the light
[51:51] so the heart of man got to be open
[51:53] before he the light of God the gospel of
[51:57] the word of God can penetrate the heart
[52:00] of the Soul amen a man must be born
[52:03] again that is important that the Holy
[52:06] Ghost come in and if the Holy Ghost do
[52:09] not come that person will never be able
[52:12] to see and understand the things of God
[52:15] without the Holy Ghost they don't know
[52:17] amen it's no you should trying to make
[52:21] them do or trying to show them the the
[52:25] light of the word because they'll never
[52:28] see it without the Holy Ghost it doesn't
[52:30] matter how much it means to you amen it
[52:34] don't mean too much to them because they
[52:36] cannot see except they have eyes to see
[52:40] is here are you a man he said he that
[52:44] has
[52:46] ear to hear Let Him
[52:49] see what I'm saying if you don't have
[52:50] that ear to hear he can't hear
[52:53] oh yeah
[52:54] so let's let's try to understand that so
[52:57] your approach because uh a lot of times
[53:00] I approached you witnessing and talking
[53:03] the things of the Lord you just take for
[53:06] granted because you see it everybody
[53:07] ought to see it because you know
[53:09] everybody ought to know not so
[53:12] so he says
[53:15] and this man
[53:18] Apollos can only do what has been
[53:20] revealed to him
[53:23] now it says in the 26th verse it says
[53:30] he told forever and dealing to the
[53:32] things that knowing only the baptism of
[53:34] John and he spent
[53:38] and he began to speak boldly in the
[53:41] synagogue
[53:42] whom when Aquila
[53:45] and Priscilla husband and wife had heard
[53:49] they took him unto him
[53:52] and expounded unto him the way of God
[53:55] more what
[53:56] perfectly let me I'm gonna try to
[53:59] embarrass you in front of the people
[54:01] can I meet with you privately and you
[54:04] know God has revealed this and share
[54:07] some things with you amen
[54:10] you know can I come by your house or can
[54:13] we meet and maybe go out to a cup of
[54:16] coffee or something and uh let me show
[54:19] you some things the Lord is revealed I
[54:21] like to take you out to dinner or
[54:24] invite you over or something let's sit
[54:27] down and I want to share some things
[54:29] with you you know
[54:32] and you only can feed them
[54:35] what they can eat
[54:38] are you you can't give them things
[54:41] that's going to choke them and expect
[54:43] them amen to survive
[54:47] are you with me
[54:48] but if you you see what they can eat
[54:51] then you can give them what they can eat
[54:53] there's no usually you giving them a big
[54:56] steak
[54:58] and that they can't eat it
[55:01] amen
[55:03] so you might just have to uh give them a
[55:07] liquid diet
[55:08] or something is soft
[55:11] something that you know they can receive
[55:14] see a person ain't gonna listen to you
[55:17] until they find out you care about them
[55:21] see before you can witness to a person
[55:23] you got they got to know you care about
[55:25] them and you love them
[55:28] because if they don't if you're not if
[55:31] they don't sense that you care about
[55:34] see because you can care about
[55:36] them knowing things
[55:38] and understanding the Bible but you
[55:41] don't care about me as a person then
[55:43] that that ain't gonna worry
[55:46] but if a person realize you care about
[55:48] them as a person then you can talk to
[55:51] them
[55:52] but if you don't and that's what I I
[55:56] feel like a lot of times we miss people
[55:58] because people don't know whether you
[56:00] care about them or you just want them to
[56:02] know what you know are trying to get
[56:04] them to be a part of your church or
[56:07] understand what you believe it may not
[56:11] even be for them
[56:13] but if you genuinely care for them amen
[56:16] you're just gonna care for them whether
[56:19] they receive it or not
[56:21] you still care for them you still want
[56:24] to be the friend and you're going to be
[56:26] a Christian and a brother a sister to
[56:28] them
[56:29] are you with me
[56:30] and then maybe later on
[56:33] they said that person really cared about
[56:35] me
[56:36] and they didn't try to put their
[56:38] religion on what they believe on me
[56:41] but they genuinely cared for like me as
[56:45] an individual and when they got a
[56:47] problem they might say you pray for me
[56:49] pray for my family pray for this
[56:52] situation and you continually pray for
[56:54] them and situations after a while
[56:57] they'll start communicating a little
[56:59] they say well you know
[57:01] I might visit your church
[57:04] you know what I'm saying
[57:06] I want to come amen because you're such
[57:08] a sweet person your light has clearly
[57:11] shined to them and they've clearly seen
[57:15] Jesus Christ in your life so it it
[57:18] caused them to hey you know I
[57:23] I like what you're getting so sometimes
[57:25] people can be Christians and and say but
[57:30] amen your life might be shining a little
[57:33] bit brighter
[57:34] then they're like and they might see hey
[57:37] hey
[57:38] you got something you know I ain't got
[57:41] what you got
[57:42] and I need what you got
[57:44] so he said have you received the Holy
[57:47] Ghost since you believe
[57:49] you know I'm not taking away whether you
[57:51] believe or not but have you received the
[57:54] Holy Ghost sensibly
[57:57] I'm not saying you're not a Believer but
[57:59] I'm saying have you received the Holy
[58:01] Ghost since you believe
[58:04] okay
[58:07] so he says here
[58:10] um
[58:11] in the 27th verse and when they
[58:15] was
[58:17] disposed to pass unto Ikea
[58:20] the Brethren wrote
[58:23] exhorting the disciples to receive him
[58:26] who when he was come help them much
[58:30] which had believed through Grace
[58:34] he believed how did he believe
[58:37] through Grace
[58:38] amen
[58:40] for he moderately convinced the what
[58:43] Jews and publicly showing by what
[58:49] that Jesus Christ
[58:51] that Jesus
[58:54] was Christ
[58:56] are you with me
[58:57] that was a powerful Revelation back in
[59:00] that day
[59:01] for somebody to receive that Jesus
[59:04] Christ
[59:06] it is so much and so that people think
[59:10] that an individual is not baptized in
[59:13] Jesus Christ that he's brought a
[59:14] revelation
[59:17] if you don't if you're not baptizing
[59:19] Jesus Christ and you don't have the Holy
[59:23] Ghost then your ball your vote of
[59:26] Revelation
[59:27] amen that God don't deal with you
[59:31] but this man has been dealt with amen
[59:34] and he had a revelation and publicly
[59:37] amen he was ferving in the spirit so God
[59:41] can deal with people Amen in in a
[59:44] Justified state in the spirit of God and
[59:47] the anointing of God can be upon their
[59:49] lives but one thing about it when a
[59:52] police came to uh it came to pass in the
[59:56] 19th verse or
[59:58] that while police were that can rent
[1:00:00] Paul haven't passed it off of course
[1:00:02] came to heavens and finding certain
[1:00:03] disciples he said unto them have you up
[1:00:08] the second verse 19-2 he said in them
[1:00:11] have you what
[1:00:14] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:00:16] you believe
[1:00:18] now notice you can be a believable you
[1:00:20] know I believe Jesus is saved me I
[1:00:22] accepted him as my personal Savior and I
[1:00:25] believe Jesus Christ is Lord I believe
[1:00:27] he's the son of God thank God for that
[1:00:30] but have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:00:32] since then
[1:00:34] are you with me
[1:00:36] now
[1:00:37] uh oftentimes
[1:00:40] uh the the Oneness they usually baptized
[1:00:44] the emphasis is so much on baptism
[1:00:48] and the water baptism
[1:00:50] until they miss out on
[1:00:53] what really saves a man
[1:00:57] so and then they they put the emphasis
[1:01:00] on speaking in tongues
[1:01:02] until they missed out on whether a
[1:01:05] person had received the Holy Ghost see
[1:01:08] they when a person speak in tongue they
[1:01:10] think automatic that person got the Holy
[1:01:12] Ghost well he got the Holy Ghost I heard
[1:01:14] him speak in tongues
[1:01:16] and instead of praying that the person
[1:01:18] received the Holy Ghost they're praying
[1:01:20] that they receive the Holy Ghost but
[1:01:21] they're more praying that this person
[1:01:23] speak in tongues because they believe
[1:01:25] the tongues is the evidence that the
[1:01:27] person got the Holy Ghost
[1:01:29] and a lot of pers people have tarot and
[1:01:33] they said Jesus Jesus Jesus said uh
[1:01:35] hallelujah hallelujah and NFL anointed
[1:01:38] and power of God the spirit of God come
[1:01:40] on them and they feel good and they feel
[1:01:43] like they got the Holy Ghost but uh you
[1:01:46] know how do you know when you got the
[1:01:48] Holy Ghost
[1:01:49] uh you know and and people walk away
[1:01:51] with Victory they feel good and anointed
[1:01:55] and the power of God made we were
[1:01:57] working in their life for a few days
[1:02:00] in a few days after a few days the devil
[1:02:03] beating them up and they might do the
[1:02:05] same thing they used to do and they
[1:02:07] don't have any uh Deliverance power
[1:02:10] because the spirit of God and anointing
[1:02:13] of God God on them but they wasn't
[1:02:16] completely filled up
[1:02:18] amen they had a potion of the spirit and
[1:02:21] they felt the grace of God but as far as
[1:02:24] being filled they wasn't enough fluid
[1:02:27] with the Holy Ghost and sealed then
[1:02:30] or you have been
[1:02:32] disagree not the holy spirit of God
[1:02:34] whereby your seal
[1:02:37] see so one thing about uh receiving the
[1:02:41] Holy Ghost is another thing whether you
[1:02:44] sealed until the day of redemption
[1:02:47] see because a lot of times people amen
[1:02:50] they do things that are out of character
[1:02:53] they do things and they they seem to be
[1:02:56] I know you can be holy ghost have the
[1:02:59] Holy Ghost and be weak and do some
[1:03:01] things but there's always a a a a a a a
[1:03:04] a a a a a repentant spirit inside of you
[1:03:08] you're always going to repent you the
[1:03:11] devil cannot hold you down
[1:03:14] because in Acts 1 and 8 he said after
[1:03:17] the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall
[1:03:19] have what
[1:03:21] power now how come amen people say well
[1:03:24] I can't overcome this I can't overcome
[1:03:26] that after the Holy Ghost come you shall
[1:03:29] have power
[1:03:30] and he said uh this is the victory that
[1:03:33] overcomes the world even our what faith
[1:03:37] amen so you overcome by the what
[1:03:40] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:03:42] your testimony isn't that right
[1:03:44] so it's oftentimes we're trapped
[1:03:48] we're trapped in and we're not
[1:03:51] Overcomers and we don't have victory in
[1:03:53] our lives it only because amen we have
[1:03:58] been told that we have something that we
[1:04:01] don't have
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:05] the Baptist teach that you have the Holy
[1:04:08] Ghost When You Believe
[1:04:10] but here we said have you re plead the
[1:04:13] Holy Ghost since you believe
[1:04:15] now this you see what I'm saying these
[1:04:18] individual was Believers and they were
[1:04:19] baptized by John about uh Baptists amen
[1:04:23] but they didn't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:04:25] when they bleed
[1:04:27] amen they received Jesus Christ when
[1:04:29] they believed
[1:04:30] they had Revelation and God did some
[1:04:33] things in their life but the Holy Ghost
[1:04:35] since you believe
[1:04:37] praise God but they couldn't walk in
[1:04:40] Victory in their lives they didn't have
[1:04:42] no victory
[1:04:43] amen
[1:04:45] they just yes they came to church and
[1:04:47] yes they sang on the choir yes they did
[1:04:50] but where's the victory in your life
[1:04:52] amen sometimes you know the devil
[1:04:56] knocked you down and you couldn't get up
[1:04:58] but the Holy Ghost give you power
[1:05:01] the get back up
[1:05:03] amen the Holy Ghost is not weak the
[1:05:06] devil just can't push Jesus around
[1:05:08] because great is he does what
[1:05:11] and you didn't hear that it's in the
[1:05:13] world the devil just can't push you
[1:05:15] around like you sinner your son or
[1:05:17] daughter God when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:05:20] you got power you got Authority
[1:05:23] you're walking in Victory
[1:05:25] Victory what victory over the world
[1:05:28] victory over the devil the things of the
[1:05:31] world
[1:05:32] the Holy Ghost come to give you
[1:05:34] resurrected power when he rose he rose
[1:05:37] victoriously
[1:05:39] over death hell in the grain
[1:05:42] are you with me
[1:05:46] so he said have you received the Holy
[1:05:47] Ghost since you believe now
[1:05:50] how do you know that you really when
[1:05:53] you're walking in power
[1:05:55] because the Holy Ghost come to give you
[1:05:56] power
[1:05:58] and then not only does it give you power
[1:06:01] you should be Witnesses
[1:06:03] of me in Acts 1 and 8 You're Gonna Be A
[1:06:06] Witness if you're not witnessing no more
[1:06:08] that means you you need to get back on
[1:06:11] your knees and get re
[1:06:13] established in God
[1:06:15] you don't witness to try to bring people
[1:06:18] to Brian Tabernacle
[1:06:21] but you witness to try to bring people
[1:06:24] to Jesus Christ
[1:06:25] once you lose your ability to witness
[1:06:28] and try to win a soul to Christ then
[1:06:31] something you'll your light is going out
[1:06:35] but if you're trying to bring them to
[1:06:37] anything so I'm trying to get people to
[1:06:39] the message to the hour I'm talking

[1:22:18] praise God because amen you're not
[1:22:21] theirs
[1:22:22] amen so what God gives us we got to be
[1:22:26] thankful to God you gave it to me and I
[1:22:30] appreciate what you gave me
[1:22:33] Hallelujah
[1:22:34] you see what I'm saying I I it may not
[1:22:37] make too much sense but a lot of times
[1:22:39] we seek and we try to find something uh
[1:22:42] apparent that's gonna uh uh preach a
[1:22:45] Ministry a church that's gonna sue me
[1:22:49] I mean you deceived you you really
[1:22:52] you're really in a great deception
[1:22:54] because you're gonna take the word and
[1:22:57] you're gonna uh place the word make the
[1:22:59] word suit you
[1:23:02] you're gonna take Jesus and Let Jesus
[1:23:04] you're gonna tell Jesus how to treat you
[1:23:08] you're going to tell Jesus how amen what
[1:23:11] you ought to be saying is what I say
[1:23:15] see it's something about having you know
[1:23:18] parents and they they should be leading
[1:23:21] you but you want to leave your father
[1:23:23] than your mama
[1:23:25] are you with me and some people want to
[1:23:28] you know the church amen want to be
[1:23:31] called The Bride of Jesus Christ or the
[1:23:33] wife of Jesus Christ but the church want
[1:23:35] to be leading the husband which is Jesus
[1:23:37] Christ and he's the word and they want
[1:23:39] to be the one lead
[1:23:42] seven women take over to one man to let
[1:23:44] us eat our own bread but let us be
[1:23:46] called by your name
[1:23:48] are you with me
[1:23:50] and that's what's happening in the
[1:23:52] church people want
[1:23:54] a church that's going to make them feel
[1:23:57] comfortable
[1:24:00] all about my convenience my comfort and
[1:24:04] I don't need all of that to be saved no
[1:24:08] you don't
[1:24:11] know you certainly don't need all of
[1:24:13] that
[1:24:15] I don't need all of this and that to be
[1:24:17] saved I'm saved because Jesus died for
[1:24:22] my sins
[1:24:24] I'm saved because I've accepted him as a
[1:24:27] lord of my life
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:30] I question that
[1:24:33] the Lord means he rules and he's in
[1:24:35] control
[1:24:37] I questioned that
[1:24:38] the Bible said he the spirit of Truth to
[1:24:41] lead you into all truth isn't that right
[1:24:46] so
[1:24:47] salvation
[1:24:49] we're talking about the grace of God
[1:24:51] um I said two
[1:24:53] I gotta close you know
[1:24:55] but and uh seven
[1:24:58] um two and eight if eating two and eight
[1:25:00] but by the grace of God
[1:25:03] uh
[1:25:06] I I believe it's it's total Grace
[1:25:09] but I'm saying don't make Grace a
[1:25:11] disgrace
[1:25:14] don't take and make Jesus Christ
[1:25:17] a disgrace don't take the word of God
[1:25:19] and and just do what you want because
[1:25:22] I'm saved and I'm saved by grace
[1:25:26] I and I thank God that I know I'm saved
[1:25:29] no no no no you make and do anything you
[1:25:33] big and bad enough to do and live any
[1:25:36] kind of way you want to live but you
[1:25:39] saved by grace no no no no don't take
[1:25:42] Grace and make it a disgrace
[1:25:45] amen people are Christians are doing the
[1:25:50] same thing the world is doing and they
[1:25:52] say well I'm saved and I know I'm saved
[1:25:55] and they bold and they're bad and
[1:25:58] they're tough and they're rough but one
[1:26:00] they gonna give account to God
[1:26:02] one day they'll face God and God said
[1:26:04] huh you bad you big you did what you
[1:26:08] want isn't that right and you told God
[1:26:11] Amen I got a preacher to tell me I'm
[1:26:14] saved and I'm all right
[1:26:17] are you up man
[1:26:19] you know we got some people that don't
[1:26:21] that have rejected the Holy Ghost
[1:26:24] that don't want the Holy Ghost
[1:26:27] God bless you
[1:26:29] he said
[1:26:30] I'm closing right here come on up kill
[1:26:33] them
[1:26:34] musician amen for by Grace ye are saved
[1:26:38] through faith
[1:26:40] and then not of yourself it is the what
[1:26:43] not it works at least any man should
[1:26:46] what
[1:26:46] both
[1:26:48] now because of that
[1:26:50] people are actually excited I'm saved by
[1:26:55] grace
[1:26:56] that means brother sister I don't need
[1:27:00] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:03] because the Holy Ghost is going to lead
[1:27:06] you and guide you
[1:27:07] but I'm saved
[1:27:10] and because they saved they say I got
[1:27:12] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:14] are you up man
[1:27:16] I'm saved
[1:27:19] I predestinate I've been ordained of God
[1:27:22] I know I got the Holy Ghost
[1:27:27] I think you got it but I don't know what
[1:27:29] the Holy Ghost got you
[1:27:33] you got the Holy Ghost but the Holy
[1:27:35] Ghost Ain't Got You
[1:27:37] are you with me
[1:27:39] you telling God how to how to lead you
[1:27:42] how to guide you and how to use you
[1:27:44] instead of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:27:47] when you led by the spirit of God by the
[1:27:50] word of God you talking about some
[1:27:51] homophone
[1:27:53] you talking about folks that trying to
[1:27:55] please God the holy ghost that cause you
[1:27:57] to want to do what the word say and want
[1:28:00] to live like the word amen and it'd be
[1:28:03] easy why because it's not you that live
[1:28:07] in this Christ that lives inside you God
[1:28:10] bless you this morning are you all right
[1:28:13] amen it's not what we've done not what
[1:28:15] we can do it's by Grace your saved
[1:28:19] you know I said thank God for the church
[1:28:22] we came out and the apostolic people
[1:28:24] they they place a lot of emphasis on the
[1:28:27] baptism in Jesus Christ's name which is
[1:28:29] right but at the same time
[1:28:32] if you don't be careful you'll think
[1:28:35] that the water savior
[1:28:38] are you with me
[1:28:40] and and if you could do a work
[1:28:43] that can save you then you you believe
[1:28:46] the grace of God is in vain
[1:28:48] it's not what we've done is what Jesus
[1:28:51] has done for us
[1:28:54] are you with me
[1:28:55] somebody said if I tarry I Call On Jesus
[1:28:59] uh Jesus I call it a fast I get the Holy
[1:29:02] Ghost when I speak in tongue it's not
[1:29:04] your tongue that fill you with the Holy
[1:29:06] Ghost
[1:29:08] it's not how fast you call it now how
[1:29:10] about you praise and how about you jump
[1:29:12] and Shout that don't mean nothing
[1:29:16] Devils can do that
[1:29:19] but the Holy Ghost come from God
[1:29:23] when you total Surrender Your Life to
[1:29:25] him and when you yield completely to him
[1:29:28] it's the Lord not my will but let your

[1:29:35] wherever you will no matter what
[1:29:38] difficult and how it oh Lord I want you

[1:30:43] do you want to control your own destiny

[1:30:48] foundation of the world and has put
