Lord in Jesus name we pray amen Matthew 24:24 thank God again for his grace this morning you know every day The Sun Ain't shining it's raining but God it takes the rain to bring forth the seed amen so by the grace of God Matthew 24:24 just one verse here it says for there shall arise false Christ false anointed ones and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders false teaching Amen in so much that if it were possible they shall what they shall deceive the very Le God bless you so the topic this morning is that the Le Cann not be deceived they elect you might say uh brother Simmons what who are the elect since they cannot be deceived and I want to uh go to uh uh Revelation 13 and show you that the devil you no you you're no match for the devil don't even try Revelation 13 And1 and I beheld another Beast come up out of this Earth talking about America and he had two horns like a lamb the buffalo and he spake as a dragon like Rome spoke amen and he exercise all the power of the first Beast before him and he causes the Earth and them that what Revelation 13 and 12 and them that dwell they in to what worship the first Beast whose deadly wounds heal and he does great wonders so that he make it far to come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of of men and he deceiveth what he deceived them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image now we have the Catholic church and the image to Protestants of image to the Beast which had been wounded by sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that they sh that the image of the Beast should both speak and causes that as many as would not worship the image of of the Beast would be what killed becoming and he calluses what he causes what he causing all both small and what rich and what free and bound to receive what Mark in their right hand or in the forehead you received the teaching and then you act upon it the Antichrist teaching and doing the will of the Antichrist some people said I'll never receive the mark of the beast we know that old beast called the devil people are actually serving the devil right now but they said I never do I never receive the mark of the beast you better be careful may be that you already received it because you're doing what the devil tell you to do are you with me so the devil is very deceptive and as I was said in Sunday school this morning it's such a thin line and such a thin line but I I don't want to talk about the devil I want to talk about the elect are you with me uh the elect cannot be deceived but showing you that showing you that the devil is going to deceive all but he can't deceive you are you with me you are not saved by how much knowledge you got but he said he is the man that has wisdom let him count the number of the Beast for is the number of a man so by the grace of God it's not what you know the Bible said no we understand all knowledge are you with me you can have all knowledge and still the devil still got you are you with me do you understand all Mysteries see what I'm saying people think I'm saved because of the Mysteries that I got what makes you elect because you understand all Mysteries are you with me let's look at 1 Corinthians 13 and see because a lot of people are so secured because they understand the mistress 1 Corinthians 13 for a minute it says in the second verse and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand what understand all Mysteries and all what and though I have all Faith see what I'm saying it does that make you elect some people think they going to mystify themselves into rapturing faith if I understand all mistress then I I am the elect but this is not said that okay it says though I understand though though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith some people are so proud of their faith that amen they Faith you know Lord bless me to do this do that and they're so pumped up and and they got faith and God does things through them and for them though I have all Faith does that make you elect are you with me so that I could remove mountains does that make you relay and have not what see brother Fred you see that I have not charity and have not charity it profit me what what let tell you something people are going here going there looking for this and looking for that but don't know who they are the bride has to recognize who she is then the Rapture can take place ain't that right if you don't know who you are you're going to look for somebody else to fulfill the void in your life the thing that you thirsting for maybe be the thing that amen it it it is not going to make you the elect some people you know uh thought that hey do I understand our Mysteries and do I and some preachers preach like you got to understand what I'm saying you got to believe it this way you got to believe it that way I got it does that make you elect because they got it some group oh we got it over here we got it over there what makes you elect the elect means to be picked out a chosen of God selected are you with me elect means to be picked out or chosen of God or elected selected are you with me so brothers and sister we can get excited we can get stir we can hoop and holler we can dance and Shout does that make us elect I want us to realize that it's not you choosing him it's him choosing you yes you can choose the church you go to the preacher you want to listen to but all of your choices is not going to make you elect the elect cannot be deceived and we know that the spirit of antichrist is in the world it was there when Jesus was there it was there when the apostles was there the the Antichrist spirit that was stood against the word to be against the word John know had to deal with it they said the spirit of antichrist is in the world now so brother and sister we going to have to understand the spirit of antichrist the prophet of God bought out that an antichrist spirit is to be against the word it doesn't matter who it is if they're against the word that's the spirit of antichrist but if you agree with every word that proceeded out in the mouth of God then I know who you are man should not live by bread alone but by what every word I'm going tell you the eve the Bible said Adam was not what Adam was not deceived but the woman being what I'm going tell you the church will be deceived but Adam won't be deceived are you with me because Adam was the original seed The Original Seed could not be deceived but the woman being the byproduct isn't that right the devil was able to deceive her but she won't be able to deceive him the devil tried to come against Christ said if you be the Son of God say it's all about knowing who you are on he said if you be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread Jesus say I ain't got to prove nothing to you I ain't got to prove a thing to you who I am are you with me I'm going tell you something when people try to make you prove who you are something wrong with with them that's that same devil that came to Jesus try to make him prove and you know where that Spirit come from you don't have to prove anything to anybody Jesus knew who he was brother and sister you have confidence if you're the elect of God you have confidence in knowing who you are praise God I don't care how great a teacher come by a preacher come by I don't care how many miracles they do it don't are you with me you must be well established in the faith because you know who you are Jesus just kept on saying it is what it is written the bride going to stay with what what's written amen prop God he said I can't add anything to the Bible and I can't take nothing away from it he admonish us to stay with the Bible isn't that right are you with me stay with the word of God praise God but sometime folk want you to stay with their persuasion okay I don't know why I want to go this way but by the grace of God it's all in you having confidence confidence not in your pastor I I believe you had ought to have confidence in him but not the kind of confidence that people going amen you're going to rest your uh ET Eternal destination off of Amen what your pastor believe you must have your own experience amen amen the pastor should only witness to what you are already no amen man but because he said The Confidant which is the Holy Ghost when he come he's going to teach you what are you with me so what happens it's just a witness of what you already know are you with me so let's just go to Ephesians 1 and three there see I I I'm going tell you something people jump up and down and try to beat you to pieces because you don't know like they know or you don't know what you know and try to make you look stupid might try to belit you and try to make you to think that they high and you low and they are super duper but brother and sister don't C that's them got nothing against that but I want you to know where you stand praise God just you got to have confidence in where you stand praise God because those that greater in the sight of men I don't know how God looking at them praise God but that little one that that that one that you know that they desire the crumbs that fall from the master table are you with me that that that little one the despised one the rejected one that one that don't seem to amen have that uh intellectual ability that you have but they've been with Jesus they've been with Jesus Jesus amen praise God God vindicates their life amen God keeps them and he knows them that are his are you with me so you have confidence in the god that call you by his grace thank God you chose me Hallelujah I I didn't choose him but he chose me amen I was unworthy but he counted me worthy Hallelujah I'm glad for God choosing me and that's why I'm happy to be a Christian I'm happy that I'm saved amen I'm happy that God Amen chose me to believe the message of the hour the word for my day amen it's not that CU I was most uh intelligent or the uh smart or intellectual is because of his chooses and revealing it to me Paul said when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's wound and call me by his grace to reveal his son in me thank God he revealed his son in me to give me confidence to stand against all the wies of the devil are you with the Devil is tricky he's got a lot of schemes but I have confidence in him that is able to keep me from falling and to present me forless amen thank you Jesus I'm glad I got a good God I'm glad God Amen praise God he did the choosing he picked me out praise God he could have picked somebody else he could have chose somebody else but he chose me aren't you glad he chose you Hallelujah there may one sitting here today amen don't know who who they are but you are the chosen elect of God if you can hear the voice of
