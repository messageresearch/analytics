pray God that you'll meet every need in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you amen The Book of Romans 2 brother um Gene from Boynton Beach Florida sent his greetings brother Jack from West Palms and his greetings and the Saints there brother Bernard from Miami they send their greetings for Miami so we had a chance to Fellowship through the week to those particular fellowships and and everybody's it's the greatest thanks for them and we just sister Hannah and Brother David we stayed with them while we were down and said that greetings also and Trinidad brother Paul from Trinidad The Book of Romans 2 and 27 it said it says here 28 excuse me 28. for he's not a Jew which is one hourly neither is that circumcision which is one which is outwardly in the flesh but he is a Jew which is in with one inwardly circumcision that is of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose phrase is not of men but of God may God bless you read this word you may be seated in a time like this where people are seeking identity they want to be identified with the ancestors and where they came from and who are they and there's a big move among even Black America but the black Jews and the everywhere so people are fighting and they're becoming angry and frustrated because people want to be Jews and who are the real Jews or whether they uh the ones that's over in Israel now or the ones that are on Wall Street and so forth Jews so the question is what does it mean to you and I to be a Jew who are the real Jews so by the grace of God and because people are associated being the Jew with God's chosen people God's blessed people and God's promises the Jew realize that God made promises and promised to bless them so they'll look at God's chosen and we're especially and inside of God we are blessed but who are the real Jews here Romans Paul speaks of like this he says he's not a Jew that's one awfully and as we speak of in the message of that was the Bride of Jesus Christ so who's the real bride and look at the Christian world who are the real Christians so it's many Avenues we could look at that because as we look at the Jews who are the Jews just ask your question are you a Christian well you're a real Christian are you someone like Paul he was a Jew hourly he thought that he was living according to the law and he was trying to do his best to keep the law he was schooled to in the learning of the law and everything you got a Zeal of God here in Romans 10 and Romans 10 Paul began to set my he said brother in my heart desire and prayer to God for Israel that there might be what save D you know I I come to a point that it's it's the harder that God is looking for we wonder why we can't get people to live right and do right and no matter how hard you preach how hard you teach it doesn't matter what you say to them sometimes we deal with how we dress how we look how we talk how we walk but all on that we can labor us hard prayer fast in everything go through all emotions but of our heart not right amen don't have a problem with the people that got the right kind of hard a lot of folks are twisted up in their minds and everybody's trying to be a Christian according to their own interpretation of what a Christian is Paul had his own upbringing as a chew and tried his best to live blameless some folks honestly to surely would you have others just going through the motion they have not really dedicated to what they really supposed to believe you got others that are just going through the motion they care less about what they supposed to believe they're living their own life doing their own thing yet they identify because it's the family it's the traditional thing to do so we have those that identify by family and almost that they've been born in a certain family and this is a religion of the family so people keep the tradition of the family and they never come into a real experience with God that's what happens many of times that people but Paul it's even though he had such a dedication that amen that what he had been taught was rooted and built in him he he had some stamina that he stood for something used to be when I was a boy if you were a Baptist you try to defend what you believe if you were a Methodist you defend what you believe and you stood for what you supposed to believe you try to understand what it took and you know but not and so you could come and bring the word and sit down with folks with the Bible and open up your Bible and start turning here and showing them in the Bible where they need the the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so forth and showing them the word where they need the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you can turn in your Bible show folks what the Bible say listen yeah I believe that and they just smile and they're going about doing their own thing because they go through the church they say love everybody just love everybody you know you know it doesn't make a difference does it but it used to be denomination you stood for that but you can't it's difficult for people Amen to really see the Bible and and the word and walk in it now it's different to see light and begin to walk in the light as you see light people just sit back and they stare at it yeah I see exactly what you're saying mm-hmm thank you and go on about their business but it used to be a time where people saw light and they wanted to walk in it oh my church not saying that my preacher ain't saying that oh this is this Bible oh thank you and people wanted to they left churches they left their denomination they left whatever and then what what the scripture say now thank you I'm just satisfied with just you know I I can go to heaven just like I am anyway you know it's no church perfect it's it's no uh uh nobody's perfect you know everybody got something wrong with them and that's the way people are today people said in the message of the hour said oh everybody got something you know nobody's got it all nobody's there nobody's just holy enough you know it's a I look at what the prophet was saying he said be perfect that's what Jesus said be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect isn't that right but we have an excuse for not being perfect your Perfection is not that uh see when the Jews came and opened up a sacrifice sacrifice had to be without spot without blemish without wrinkle anything that sacrifice you had to examine it and make sure the sacrifice is perfect are you up man and because of our sacrifice it's perfect the Lamb of God is our perfect sacrifice are you a man and when we amen when we even put our hand on we our faith in that lamb that sacrifice we are perfected in him a European it's because of our sacrifice nothing that we can do nothing that we have done but our abortion is in him praise God it's because of what he's done makes me who I am are you up man without him I'm nothing praise God because I'm a Son of God because of my sacrifice [Music] because he sacrificed his life for me I got overhead on my story I thought I picked that up but we're dealing with Jews do you know what real Christians real Jews sometimes you said my heart desired prayer to God than the Israel said it might be saved and I'll tell you something you and I will you know great conflict amen a battle and your heart desire to but Israel now and for the people of God it might be saved but I'll tell you she looked on the horizon folks don't care about their soul they care more about everything but their soul their soul is not valuable it's not important to them no matter how much you care about their soul they don't care about their own soul for where your tragedy is there will your heart be they care more about what they're going to achieve in this world and in this life than they care about eternal life you can't convince them to love God so he said about Israel he says for the I dialed them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God rights and it's going to about to establish their what their own righteousness amen and have not submitted themselves to unto the righteousness of God are you with me you as a Christian ought to submit yourself but you cannot submit yourself when you are surrounded by the demon you imprisoned by lusting by the Flesh and the things of the world you cased in as the prophet said your cage Zen amen with the Lost demons in the amen the sinful life you're in a cage you were born to be free Sons and Daughters of God Amen praise God Amen it's like an eagle that's in a cage amen but God wants to take amen that cage away and let the Eagles Fly Above the things of the world amen so you can't fly because you're occased in by amen the Demons of lost and and all the filthiness and unclean things but it takes the holy spirit amen the anointing of God that you can fly above that without the Holy Ghost you can't get out of that cage but amen God intended before the foundation of the world that he foreknew you he knew the one that you were a son or daughter of God but you were cage are you a man and God Amen to Jesus Christ amen has amen broken he breaks the bondage amen he tears down the cage praise God hallelujah and he makes it possible for you to be free from your lust amen free from all the filthiness of the Flesh and his Spirit you've got to be free from that not pound not payment not caught up in your lust for desires except for habits God wants to set you free from that praise God Hallelujah for whom the son is set free is free indeed amen praise God but it takes you you know some folks if you're set him free and you open the cage some folks are so used to it they're staying it some folks are staying in sin and they'll stay in their lusts and amen in their sin for habits and the things of the world because they don't want to be free amen but there are others that given the opportunity amen but I said you know it's something about but the assurance and amen thank God for the prophet of the hour answered assurance that if God obtains you amen you have to come to that reality praise God if you are ordained to be a son or daughter of God you come to that reality you come to that place that I'm not going to stay here I Was Born to Be Free praise God for my love and these evil desires I want to be free Hallelujah praise God the word of God comes to you and let you know amen you're amen that you were ordained before the foundation of the world to be a Son of God of God praise God God Saul amen the real Jews in you praise God he saw that you were raw your seed amen God saw him and you there praise God Amen he can look amen as he looked at Jacob and Esau he said Jacob as I love and he so have I hated even before the children were born amen he knew which one amen praise God what one day wrestle with the angel and become a prince with God are you with me and God knows that one day even you'll hear the voice of God and you say I want to be free praise God hallelujah my God my savior I I want to stay there but I got to move on Amen the book of Deuteronomy 30 and uh six it's all about God giving you what you need to be what he wants you to be amen Ezekiel 36 says I knew hard and a new spirit will I give you and I will put my spirit within you are you with me it's all about what God does for you not what you can do for God but what God can do for you and Kennedy this acts not what your country can do for you that's what you but I'm not asking what you know the country or whatever was what God has already done for me I said he already done it for me and God is already saved you just like he's already healed you with this Stripes you were healed are you up man so you can lay hold on your heel and you can tell the devil that with his strike time he healed for he was wounded for our transgression bruised and then you can say because of Jesus dying on the cross I'm saved amen I believe that and I'm standing on I'm saved praise God somebody said I'm saved sanctify Holy Ghost filled and fire baptized praise God and you can't take it from there praise God it doesn't matter what you do to me amen amen the joy that I have the word didn't give it in the world can't take it away isn't that right so when you got it praise God you got something amen that the devil can't mess with you amen the devil don't know how to handle you praise God because you got something in that praise God that would burn him amen if he tried to come at you praise God he'd get burnt you can't touch it it's too hot for it praise God that fire will burn you mean that right so when you got the fire in the inside the devil saw Jesus zip amen for why come to told me before the time amen praise God because he knew amen that what was that the wit that God was in Christ he knew that God was in there amen and the devil knows when you got God on the inside praise God he just tried to talk you out from behind the word because you're fortified behind the word as long as you stand on that word the devil Can't Get Next To You praise God but you stand I'm standing on your word Lord praise God just come on devil come on you can't get back here praise God because the word has fortified us praise God hallelujah praise God you don't have to come out and try to show yourself that you somebody praise God I'm fortified behind the word as long as I stand behind the word the word is my protection he said of your abide in me and my word abiding you then you can act what you will and I'll do it I'm so glad amen because the word of God I hid it in my heart amen you got to get it in your heart amen that word if I hit into my heart that I might not oh yes praise God you've got to amen get this word done in you that it's something wrong somewhere brother something wrong someone's sister praise God when you got the wide on the inside praise God I don't care how much you say I'm a Jew I don't care how much you say I'm a Christian I don't care what your preacher name I don't care if you say I believe the message amen you got to have the word down on the inside the Devils believe but the tremor isn't that right the devil can't live the word neither can you that walk in the flesh you can't please God but if you walk in the spirit then the spirit of life in Christ Jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death are you a man so I thank you amen I delighted myself in the law of God in the end with man praise God I thank God and I'm free I'm free to serve my God I'm free to worship God amen because in that God has set me free for my sinful lust and all the filthiness of the Flesh and the spirit amen because he said amen if we're Sons and Daughters of God he said that God said I'll be a father to you and you shall be my sons and daughters in heaven therefore these promises daily beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and the spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God Holiness is seen to be a thing of the past people don't want to be holy no more they want to look like the world live like

always the son of God praise God you are Son of God before the foundation of the world because you were there in the mind of God amen God thought about you that's why you became a part of God because God knew you and whom he fought knew amen he predestinated praise God because he foreknew you he knew that you would receive his word he knew that you would love him with all your heart he knew that others would try and not succeed why because it's not in their hearts are you with me all the effort and all they're trying it becomes work and Duty I I I I'll make it to church when I can I do this if I can but here's the Willing one you can't get there they go overboard because their cop runs over one of the sisters Ellen and his sisters came up on Friday night she says you know I want my cup to run over in the prayer line and she probably was 70 or 80 years old probably 80 years so she said I want my cup to run over that's what I want you see I I never get enough I want more are you with me I said I look at her and just a beautiful daughter of God yet she want more I want my cup run over and you got people ain't got nothing almost and they don't even want no more than what they got and then you got others that want more I want more lord I can't get enough praise God I just want more Lord I just want to do more for God and some folks ain't doing nothing and don't want to do nothing amen but it comes to a place where a real Christian realize I have a call for a purpose amen for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus and the good work Lord I want to do more for him Lord I I want to get closer to you Lord uh that's that's where the one that's in the heart one that's willing Lord I just don't want to come to church to sit on a seat I just don't want to pay my tithes and I just don't want to just be a part of a church no and I want to get in it and I want to be a part of you I want to I want to do your will Lord God surely there's something that I can do let me do something Lord let me walk out my soul selfish and with fear and trembling God I want to do something I'm not satisfied just setting in the view amen that's what makes people box law that's what makes me before that because they don't get in there and find out what would you have me to do so you find those people that ain't doing nothing even they become complacent they become oh God you know older people said uh out of mind is the devil Workshop are you with me when you become Idol you just said I know well when you come in with a mind to do something Lord what would you happen to do if I can't sing let me pray if I can't pray oh Lord I can pray now oh everybody ought to pray what are y'all afraid Brave without ceasing isn't that right but you know as certain folks that got a proud Warriors are you with me there's no work in there praying praise God it's something that God has given them amen I'm gonna stand in the Gap amen and when you don't have prayer proud Warriors in the church I'm talking about people if you come by the house they're down on their knees they're crying out to God Lord have mercy Lord help the preacher amen the children know they're praying amen the neighbors know they're praying everybody know they're praying okay so why amen because you got those that standing in the Gap and what makes the preacher who he is and what makes the church like it is is it because you got amen people that you can't see they they don't sing and amen they're not out front but they're on their knees and they're crying now God bless amen every home every individual bless the preacher amen so the preacher walked out because of the prayers of the Saints and that's why the seals was open because of the orders of the prayers of the Saints amen he said Hallelujah praise God the incense that went up before God with the prayers of the Saints are you with me so somebody was praying God Amen this this book needs he meant to be all open book came into sealed but it needed to be open amen it was the prayer they have come to a point amen that somebody got desperate enough and brothers and sisters when you get definitely enough for a move of God things begin to happen in the Supernatural realm I don't want to go to Miami and tell them about the Supernatural and go to West Palm and tell them about the Supernatural and then go down to Boynton Beach and tell them about the supernatural but I want to Amen to Supernatural when they come to Bright Tabernacle that they see God amen the two people that said I'm amen I'm one of them I want an understanding with the word I wanted them to say yes Lord I want to live that I love I want to do something for you I want to stand for you Lord I want to be a real soldier in the army of the Lord

heart praise God are you willing to give him your heart praise God all that other stuff will be taken care of that they may seek your first the kingdom of God his righteousness all other stuff amen it'll take care of itself but I'm I'm I believe God is displeased as he looked at the condition of the church look after the condition of the folks say I believe God's son of prophet yeah that's good what kind of effect does this happen on your life is it bringing you to the knees is it putting conviction in you well I go to Bright Tabernacle what is it doing for you to go to bride Tabernacle and you still have the same to hear the different preachers from the different parts of the world is it doing something for your life do you get out and testify do you love God enough to tell them come on

bring them somewhere to see God then they ought to be looking at God when they see you are you with me well have you got to bring him to show them somebody else praise God no no no your light ought to be shining and they see Jesus Christ in you that that's why they want to come to church with you that's why I didn't want the god to do God are you with me they want that God but if your light isn't shining bright enough they don't see a reason why they ought to come to church with you are you with me if you're not happy and you're trying to teach me that the joy of the Lord is your strength is that the kind of strength I want see a lot of times folks are looking at you and they're looking at why you saying you talking about Jesus to give your joy see it's not enough to say I stopped smoking
