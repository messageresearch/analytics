[37:31] way to the end and i'll i'll read the
[37:33] next verse and we'll go from there 17
[37:37] church
[37:44] excuse me who concerned how many years
[37:47] in
[37:48] felidas who concerning the truth have
[37:52] erred
[37:53] saying that the resurrection has passed
[37:55] already
[37:57] and overthrow the faith of some that's
[38:00] what is happening
[38:01] a lot of people faith has been
[38:03] overthrown because
[38:05] it's not how many years
[38:07] and felidius
[38:09] but there's other folks that have come
[38:11] to overthrow your faith
[38:13] spirits are here
[38:15] paul dealt with it in his day and we're
[38:17] dealing with it today
[38:24] he says
[38:25] 19th verse class
[38:42] nice
[38:43] if you if you name the name of christ
[38:45] you'll depart if you're not then i
[38:47] understand
[38:49] are you with me
[38:51] if you name the name of christ you
[38:53] depart from the nicu if you're not
[38:56] if not you you keep on
[38:59] in the nicotine
[39:04] but
[39:05] in the great house there are
[39:07] not only vessels of
[39:10] gold and of civil but also wood and
[39:13] earth
[39:14] some to honor and some to disarm the 21.
[39:33] but
[39:34] follow
[39:35] righteousness
[39:38] faith
[39:39] charity peace
[39:41] with them that
[39:43] call
[39:45] on the name
[39:46] on the lord out of a what
[39:50] 23.
[39:58] and
[39:59] the servant of the lord must not strive
[40:02] but be gentle unto all men
[40:05] apt to teach patient 25.
[40:17] together
[40:18] and that they may recover themselves out
[40:21] of the snare of the devil who are taken
[40:24] captive by him at his will god bless you
[40:27] in this word you mean you see
[40:31] this morning i was looking into that
[40:34] and
[40:35] you know sometimes and i can understand
[40:38] peter said an account that the
[40:39] long-suffering of god
[40:42] is salvation
[40:44] god suffers with us a long time a long
[40:47] period of time
[40:49] and
[40:51] he could cut us off
[40:52] the moment we
[40:55] arrow the thing
[40:57] the minute we sin god could just cut us
[40:59] off
[41:02] the minute we try to do something that's
[41:04] not pleasing in his sight he could say
[41:06] boom
[41:07] and he does sometimes to some folk
[41:10] just to try to let you know
[41:12] watch out
[41:15] be careful
[41:17] because it could have been you
[41:20] are you with me
[41:22] so by the grace of god as we think on
[41:25] uh
[41:26] god knows in the 19th verse he says
[41:29] nevertheless the foundation
[41:31] of god
[41:32] stands sure
[41:35] amen
[41:37] it stands sure i mean you can anchor
[41:39] your faith in it you don't have to worry
[41:42] about
[41:43] this foundation
[41:46] the foundation is built upon the
[41:48] foundation
[41:49] of the apostles and prophets jesus
[41:51] christ himself being the chief
[41:52] cornerstone
[41:54] amen
[41:56] so the foundation is a shield foundation
[41:59] don't worry about it it'll stand the
[42:02] word of god will stand
[42:04] heaven and earth will pass away but the
[42:06] word don't stand
[42:08] it's sure
[42:10] are you with me
[42:11] so what happens amen
[42:14] um
[42:15] these things were happening in the
[42:17] church
[42:18] in ephesus i mean in the beginning
[42:21] and these things that were happening
[42:23] if we look at the for uh
[42:26] the first verse he was exhorting timothy
[42:28] he said thou therefore my son
[42:32] be strong
[42:34] in the grace
[42:36] that is
[42:37] in christ jesus
[42:41] and the things that thou has heard from
[42:44] me among many witnesses
[42:46] the same commit thou unto what
[42:50] faithful what
[42:52] did he make
[42:53] did he make a mistake and he said
[42:55] faithful women i said faithful man
[42:59] what did he mean
[43:02] okay so god the men should take headship
[43:06] but the men look like they're sitting
[43:07] back
[43:10] and the women got to come and
[43:12] run the house they got to run the church
[43:14] you got to run everything
[43:16] why because the men are laying by
[43:18] he said commit to faithful men
[43:24] praise god everybody want to step back
[43:26] and
[43:27] instruct
[43:30] men yeah i said lord
[43:34] faithful men
[43:36] faithful men
[43:38] not faithful to
[43:42] your job but faithful to the word of god
[43:46] committed to faithful men
[43:49] are you with me
[43:52] and the things that thou has
[43:55] heard of me among many witnesses
[43:57] the same commit thou unto what
[44:01] faithful men who are what
[44:03] who shall be able to what
[44:12] to teach others also
[44:16] now the faithful men are not the women
[44:19] are trying to teach the men because the
[44:22] men are not faithful
[44:25] men are looking to their moms to teach
[44:27] them
[44:28] because the dad is not there
[44:31] are you with me
[44:33] in the house in the church
[44:36] men look like they come of a can of a
[44:39] cat
[44:42] but the same commit to faithful men
[44:46] we're living in a time
[44:48] they lived in that day back there what
[44:51] about now
[44:55] the instruction is to commit it to
[44:57] faithful men but
[45:01] can you find faithful men
[45:03] men that's going to be dedicated to god
[45:06] you know sometimes the brothers think
[45:08] they're doing
[45:09] the pastor of favor they're doing the
[45:11] church of favor
[45:13] brothers we got to realize that god has
[45:14] committed
[45:16] the word of god you
[45:19] should be the leaders
[45:22] the head
[45:24] and not the tail
[45:27] are you with me
[45:29] the husband is the one
[45:31] the head of the wife
[45:34] are you with me
[45:35] so but they got to take their position
[45:39] in the word
[45:43] so
[45:44] headship
[45:48] just because
[45:50] a man is a
[45:53] a male figure
[45:55] don't mean that he's responsible
[45:58] are you with me we need to be able to be
[46:01] responsible
[46:04] and take on the responsibilities
[46:08] of headship
[46:12] but everybody
[46:13] passes this passage to that we're
[46:15] passing it
[46:17] so the women coming
[46:20] okay we got no choice
[46:24] the women got no choice so they take
[46:26] care handship
[46:28] and i said especially in the black house
[46:31] hole
[46:36] and sometimes we're without
[46:38] the male figure
[46:43] and sometimes
[46:45] so without the male figure
[46:48] the man almost respect the woman
[46:50] over the man
[46:53] so the young fellows they'll listen to a
[46:56] woman before they listen to a man
[46:58] because there was no male figure
[47:05] and sometimes it caused a perversion
[47:09] of the man
[47:10] you don't know how to be a man
[47:13] because he don't see a man
[47:17] but he knows how to be a woman
[47:21] and he thinks and you know this is the
[47:23] way i'm supposed to be
[47:27] it's time that
[47:29] brothers get in their position
[47:32] and be real men
[47:33] and it's time for
[47:37] the woman just to
[47:38] be in her position
[47:40] and to be a helpmate
[47:43] to love her husband and love her
[47:45] children
[47:46] let me see what i can do to help
[47:51] but how can she
[47:53] if the brothers laid back
[47:56] and don't want to lead
[48:01] many men
[48:02] especially in the black
[48:04] home
[48:05] they're not leaders and they don't want
[48:06] to leave
[48:10] and then you have those that want to
[48:12] lead but don't have the ability to leave
[48:16] we will not accept help
[48:22] so a lot of times things are always
[48:23] shipwrecked
[48:25] sometimes it comes responsibility for
[48:27] bills being paid and not paid
[48:31] struggling all the time why
[48:33] because then they'd want to be ahead but
[48:35] they don't know how to
[48:37] they did not see that or witnessed that
[48:40] in the home
[48:47] it's times when
[48:49] wives want to help
[48:51] but because this mentality i'm your head
[48:54] i'm the boss
[48:56] you cannot help
[49:02] but i want you to know that the holy
[49:04] ghost will teach you
[49:07] in a position to place you if you
[49:10] yield to the holy ghost
[49:13] the holy ghost will let a man be a man
[49:16] without
[49:19] having
[49:23] they call it male chauvinist we call it
[49:25] the nicolaitan spirit
[49:27] dominating
[49:29] you know what i'm saying
[49:31] it's all kind of things you can have
[49:34] but you can give respect and honor
[49:38] to your wife and to
[49:41] women
[49:43] without trying to
[49:45] put them as
[49:48] something that's
[49:49] of a lord species
[49:52] they call them all kind of names these
[49:54] young people that come up
[49:56] and if they listen these young people
[49:58] listen to the rap and all of that
[50:00] you know sometimes you know you'll be at
[50:02] a gas station or somewhere and they're
[50:04] calling women all kind of names and
[50:06] you're young people
[50:08] young men are listening to that
[50:10] so they won't know how to treat
[50:13] a young lady because they listen to that
[50:15] they get in the spirit to get a part of
[50:17] them they begin to say those same words
[50:19] they begin to
[50:20] rap with them and say those things
[50:29] i don't know
[50:33] let me that is that wasn't even a part
[50:36] of what i where i was going
[50:38] praise god why do men want to you know
[50:42] the bible says it's a shame for
[50:46] that woman
[50:48] to shave or cut her hair
[50:52] you know what i'm saying
[50:54] then
[50:55] he said if a man have a long hat don't
[50:57] you know what's ashamed to him
[50:59] you said it does not even nature itself
[51:02] teaches you
[51:03] you know what i'm saying
[51:06] you know
[51:07] women say they're tired of all this hair
[51:11] and men say i want it down my back
[51:16] are you with me
[51:18] so it's a spirit whatever the word go
[51:21] says the spirit of the devil said i'll
[51:24] make you bow to me
[51:28] the devil is responsible for trying to
[51:32] make men become women and women become
[51:35] men
[51:39] so the whole thing is
[51:41] out of white out of course
[51:45] so
[51:46] we'll we're living in a world that's
[51:48] turned upside down
[51:54] it's sad
[51:55] it's sad how we going to face
[51:59] god
[52:01] but god is long-suffering
[52:07] let me go ahead hold i don't know how i
[52:10] got into those things but it's something
[52:12] that's happening
[52:13] it's something happening to our young
[52:16] men
[52:18] and they don't seem to understand
[52:20] what's happening to the black
[52:23] men
[52:29] i had one of the leaders of the city
[52:32] come to me
[52:35] and he asked me a question and my wife
[52:37] was with me so would you teach
[52:40] will you come and teach
[52:42] you wanted to bring
[52:44] the preachers together and realized that
[52:47] the trouble that was in the black
[52:49] community
[52:50] and asked me will you come and teach
[52:55] because we're dealing with spiritual
[52:57] problems
[53:00] we're dealing with demons and devils
[53:03] will you come and teach
[53:06] he had the
[53:09] power to bring
[53:10] the preachers to pastors
[53:12] together and he was calling the big
[53:15] names
[53:16] the big churches
[53:17] and he wanted me to teach them
[53:22] i said no bruh not me
[53:27] because
[53:31] he wanted to deal with
[53:32] casting out devils
[53:36] can we pray and cast out devils
[53:39] you know
[53:42] if you got a devil and you don't want
[53:44] that devil to go
[53:48] minister can pray for you cast that
[53:50] devil out don't you know that devil
[53:51] coming back with seven knows the devil
[53:53] is worse than himself because you don't
[53:55] want to leave that kind of lifestyle
[54:00] if you don't want to leave that
[54:02] lifestyle the devil will come back
[54:07] so it's no use in casting the devil out
[54:09] when the people don't want the devil out
[54:17] but
[54:18] he was spiritual enough to understand
[54:20] that it's a spiritual problem in the
[54:23] black community
[54:27] it's a spiritual problem
[54:30] and the only way we're going to get it
[54:32] right we got to get with god in a
[54:37] real weight i wanna i mean you and god
[54:40] he talking to you
[54:42] you and god
[54:44] you're coming
[54:46] on one accord with god
[54:50] and i'm saying you got to get regard in
[54:52] a personal way
[54:54] if you don't know god personally as an
[54:56] individual i'm telling you
[54:58] don't look for the church to be god for
[55:01] you
[55:03] you got to know god for yourself
[55:07] not a god and thank you no god you know
[55:10] i'm talking about the only true and
[55:12] living god
[55:14] the lord jesus christ
[55:20] without a personal experience with god
[55:23] without god speaking to your heart
[55:27] then sometimes we feel like the church
[55:29] failed us
[55:30] sometimes we feel like the preachers
[55:32] feel but you
[55:37] let's look to god
[55:44] god
[55:44] never fails
[55:48] cannot fail you
[55:51] maybe you looking up to to something
[55:53] else
[55:54] but god i if if you want god nothing
[55:57] should hinder you if you get on your
[55:59] knee
[56:00] most of a lot of us when god talked to
[56:02] us it wasn't because we were in a church
[56:04] somewhere
[56:06] and god constantly deal with you day by
[56:08] day and wherever where you go until god
[56:11] until you start listening
[56:14] until you were willing to surrender to
[56:17] him dealing with you
[56:19] it didn't take much somebody to invite
[56:21] you to church and say this or that
[56:23] because you it was god already dealing
[56:25] with you
[56:31] so
[56:32] let me just go to the third verse i got
[56:34] to get get off the young men but yeah
[56:37] men
[56:39] men that want to be men
[56:45] it's not crabs in the bucket
[56:48] you know somebody tried to get up and
[56:50] you trying to pull them down
[56:56] every time somebody tried to get ups
[56:59] why this and why that
[57:02] vain babbling
[57:05] let's say something nice lift them up
[57:09] let's lift one another up
[57:15] you know i
[57:16] you know it comes to
[57:18] church all he said a brother sister be a
[57:21] fornicator don't keep no company with
[57:22] them
[57:24] we don't even know what that means no
[57:25] more
[57:28] a person can be a fornicator and we can
[57:31] keep company oh that's my
[57:34] they're not wrong with sin no more
[57:37] because why the bible don't mean a thing
[57:40] because we don't read it
[57:45] are you with me
[57:47] you got to treasure this word
[57:52] if i don't teach it and i don't preach
[57:53] it
[57:55] you know
[57:57] then i'm gonna be responsible to god
[58:01] when i face god
[58:02] i'm gonna have to get accountable to god
[58:05] you might say brother simmons throwing
[58:07] off brother simmons saying that's versus
[58:08] seven saying that but i gotta give
[58:10] account to god
[58:16] are you with me
[58:18] we're not supposed to be men pleasers
[58:22] we don't want you to feel satisfied and
[58:24] happy sinning we want you to feel
[58:26] condemned when you do wrong
[58:29] are you with me
[58:31] we want you to feel condemned enough to
[58:33] confess your sins and forsake them
[58:37] to repent
[58:39] but when you feel comfortable sinning
[58:42] and ain't nothing wrong with it
[58:44] and people treat you like
[58:48] they
[58:49] they ought to say hey brother and sister
[58:51] i don't mean no harm
[58:54] if you're not going to get right
[58:56] i can't keep up me with you
[59:00] well that's my cousin that's my this one
[59:03] that i can't keep company with you if
[59:05] you're not gonna do right
[59:10] are you with me
[59:12] now for a sinner
[59:15] that's all right
[59:17] but if a brother or sister
[59:20] is doing wrong
[59:21] that's different
[59:24] you got people that's in the world
[59:25] they're just sinners they're blocking
[59:27] you know sin and sin they're out there
[59:30] but
[59:32] we want those that call
[59:34] that are called by the name of christ to
[59:36] depart from iniquity
[59:39] we want them to live right do right and
[59:41] do the right thing
[59:44] you know a lot of them know sinners out
[59:46] there a lot of them don't know
[59:48] they don't have that experience they
[59:50] don't know
[59:51] what they do
[59:52] but you don't know the truth
[59:55] and know what's right
[59:59] you see what i'm saying
[1:00:01] it's a difference
[1:00:05] and we find people you know
[1:00:07] rare up in the church and they
[1:00:10] they do certain things and
[1:00:12] and it's almost like hey
[1:00:14] what's going on here
[1:00:17] it shouldn't be the preacher addressing
[1:00:19] it
[1:00:20] it shouldn't be that it has to come
[1:00:22] across a pulpit
[1:00:25] but we know what cain said am i my
[1:00:28] brother what
[1:00:31] do you love your brother do you love
[1:00:33] your sister
[1:00:35] are you with me
[1:00:36] if you love him love is what
[1:00:39] correcting
[1:00:41] if you love them you ought to be willing
[1:00:44] to correct them
[1:00:46] but when what
[1:00:48] when a person repent you ought to what
[1:00:51] forgive them
[1:00:53] because you want everybody to make it

[1:10:14] why are you saying what you're saying
[1:10:20] what
[1:10:21] i'm i i'm critiquing it i'm sitting here
[1:10:24] and i'm trying to find out what is he

[1:10:50] that's what we have
[1:10:52] that's what we are we're getting
[1:10:53] somewhere now because it's all about you
[1:10:56] know
[1:10:57] praise god use him speak through him it
[1:11:00] doesn't matter who it is preaching
[1:11:02] whether his brother simmons whether his
[1:11:04] brother earnest was it whoever it is
[1:11:06] lord speak to me
[1:11:09] i need help i need you lord i want to
[1:11:12] draw closer to search me oh god
[1:11:16] that's what we want
[1:11:21] he says
[1:11:23] no man that wards entangles himself with
[1:11:27] the fads or what
[1:11:29] the affairs of this life
[1:11:32] that
[1:11:33] he may please him who has chosen him
[1:11:37] to be a
[1:11:38] soldier
[1:11:40] god chose you to be a soldier not the
[1:11:42] church
[1:11:43] not brother simmons
[1:11:45] your person your relationship is with
[1:11:47] god
[1:11:49] your walk is with god
[1:11:54] and the bible teaches us to obey them to
[1:11:56] help rule over you
[1:11:58] for they watch for your soul and god to
[1:11:59] give a count for you
[1:12:01] you know what i believe
[1:12:04] we they overdid it when i was back in
[1:12:08] in the church that i came up with
[1:12:11] but we under do it
[1:12:14] we don't obey them to have a
[1:12:16] rule over us
[1:12:18] we just do what we want
[1:12:22] nobody gonna tell me nothing
[1:12:25] you know obey them because they watch
[1:12:27] for your soul must give account for you
[1:12:30] i believe that
[1:12:31] they don't think that god has an order
[1:12:35] as many think god doesn't have an order
[1:12:38] he's got to obey them to have a rule
[1:12:40] over you for the watch for your soul got
[1:12:41] to give a count for you he said
[1:12:45] wait what are you doing brother i'm
[1:12:46] doing this what are you doing sister
[1:12:48] don't know
[1:12:49] nobody i i i i know god for myself
[1:12:53] there's no
[1:12:54] fivefold ministry gave some apostles
[1:12:57] some prophets
[1:12:59] some
[1:13:01] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[1:13:03] for the what perfection of the saints
[1:13:06] so god put these officers in the church
[1:13:09] and the prophet god said if you don't
[1:13:11] respect the man respect the office
[1:13:15] are you with me and in in respect in the
[1:13:19] office you're going to respect the
[1:13:21] person
[1:13:22] are you with me
[1:13:24] so it's it's a matter of understanding
[1:13:27] god's economy amen
[1:13:31] a lot of times pastors struggle
[1:13:34] they struggle with people understanding
[1:13:37] amen their position
[1:13:41] if
[1:13:42] a pastor that's a godly pastor
[1:13:44] he would far rather
[1:13:46] be setting in the pews
[1:13:49] than to be passionate a people
[1:13:52] if he's a godly pastor he would fall and
[1:13:55] he would 100 percent rather be sitting
[1:13:57] in the pews
[1:14:00] but
[1:14:02] by the grace of god
[1:14:04] he said i am what i am
[1:14:08] praise god let's give the lord a hand
[1:14:10] clap for brother frank coming
[1:14:12] in amen
[1:14:18] they've come a long way
[1:14:21] amen
[1:14:22] i'll tell you something you get a chance
[1:14:24] to praise the lord praise the lord
[1:14:27] they come a long way
[1:14:30] praise god i thank god for him
[1:14:34] now
[1:14:36] i got to go on doctor
[1:14:38] but i saw certain things here in this
[1:14:40] chapter and i'm talking about end time
[1:14:44] every messenger that ever came on the
[1:14:46] scene the bible says in amos three seven
[1:14:48] shooters of the lord god would do
[1:14:49] nothing but he reveals his secrets to
[1:14:51] his servant the prophet
[1:14:52] in every age
[1:14:54] god addressed the angel
[1:14:56] of the church
[1:14:57] the messenger for that age in the early
[1:15:00] church paul was a messenger angel to the
[1:15:03] church and god
[1:15:05] didn't come directly to the church he
[1:15:06] said to the angel of the church
[1:15:09] he said i want you to know
[1:15:11] i said
[1:15:12] god knows
[1:15:14] let me let me go to revelation quick and
[1:15:17] i'll try to finish
[1:15:19] a god god knows revelation um two
[1:15:22] and two it says
[1:15:25] i know
[1:15:26] thy works the thou of labor and not
[1:15:28] label and patience and how thou cannot
[1:15:32] bear them with your evil
[1:15:35] are you with me
[1:15:37] and thou
[1:15:39] has tried them which say their apostles
[1:15:41] and are not and have found them to be
[1:15:43] what
[1:15:44] liars
[1:15:46] and then
[1:15:48] and has bored and has patience and
[1:15:53] and for
[1:15:54] my name's sake has labored and has not
[1:15:58] fainted nevertheless i have what
[1:16:02] because what
[1:16:05] you know
[1:16:06] every age is a is a
[1:16:09] conglomeration or all come together in
[1:16:12] the last age
[1:16:15] are you with me
[1:16:16] like the horse riders
[1:16:18] the white the red the black
[1:16:21] and all
[1:16:22] the horse riders come together in the
[1:16:24] last horse ride of the pail
[1:16:27] because you put the colors together
[1:16:29] until all
[1:16:30] the church ages come together at the end
[1:16:34] because what he said
[1:16:36] the word of god
[1:16:38] is the same
[1:16:40] yesterday and the day and forever
[1:16:42] so what i want to say he said i know god
[1:16:45] knows
[1:16:47] god knew then
[1:16:49] and god knows now
[1:16:51] are you with me
[1:16:52] he said nevertheless i have someone
[1:16:54] against you because what
[1:16:57] first love your first love is jesus
[1:16:59] christ and don't you ever leave him
[1:17:02] your first love is the word of god don't
[1:17:05] you ever leave it
[1:17:08] praise god sometimes people such and do
[1:17:11] what the prophet said oh i'm touching
[1:17:13] them no search the bible for he said
[1:17:15] search instructions for your name you
[1:17:17] think you have eternal life for daily
[1:17:19] testify of me
[1:17:21] nothing can be added to this bible
[1:17:23] nothing can be taken away from this
[1:17:24] bible
[1:17:26] somebody said well uh
[1:17:28] no not the bible plus something else
[1:17:33] the bible is your absolute
[1:17:37] you must take everything through the
[1:17:38] urine throne but i think
[1:17:41] we got it all right the bible is the
[1:17:43] absolute are you with me
[1:17:46] and the messenger can only say what's
[1:17:48] already here
[1:17:51] in every age it's got to be what's
[1:17:53] already written
[1:17:55] but there's a responsibility for each
[1:17:58] age
[1:17:59] each age has their problems and their
[1:18:03] difficulty in what they're going through
[1:18:05] and it's identified
[1:18:07] so the angel of the church ex and must
[1:18:11] uh he must
[1:18:13] address
[1:18:14] the sins of that age and the condition
[1:18:17] of that age
[1:18:18] to get the people back
[1:18:21] to where they need to be
[1:18:23] back to the
[1:18:24] word are you with me
[1:18:27] so it's all in bringing you back not to
[1:18:31] him but back to the word
[1:18:35] okay
[1:18:36] so as we move from
[1:18:40] that age ephesus he said they left their
[1:18:43] first love what about you
[1:18:46] do you love god the way you loved him
[1:18:48] when you got saved do you love him like
[1:18:51] that
[1:18:52] or other things is blocking you other
[1:18:55] things hinder you how's your
[1:18:57] relationship with god
[1:18:59] you know when you when you when you can
[1:19:01] first get saved you don't see no
[1:19:03] nobody you don't think about it you
[1:19:05] don't think about your trouble it's just
[1:19:07] lord i love you it's all about god
[1:19:10] i thank god for
[1:19:12] uh you know a sister uh
[1:19:15] sister mack amen thank god she says she
[1:19:18] said to me she said
[1:19:20] i don't know what this is
[1:19:23] it was like electricity in my box and
[1:19:26] she you know she stayed there in the
[1:19:28] pool and she stayed there for
[1:19:30] maybe 30 45 minutes just
[1:19:34] with the power of god all over her
[1:19:37] and then when she come out she says
[1:19:40] i never felt this way
[1:19:41] this it's like electricity i said that's
[1:19:43] the holy ghost
[1:19:46] sister mike is that right
[1:19:50] amen
[1:19:51] thank the lord
[1:19:53] thank the lord for sister man
[1:19:56] you know
[1:19:57] and there's something about you
[1:19:59] experiencing that and it produces love
[1:20:01] you just love everybody you just say oh
[1:20:03] god everything is wonderful lovely
[1:20:06] see that's what he's talking uh don't
[1:20:09] don't let nothing interfere with the
[1:20:10] love that you have for god
[1:20:12] and the zeal you have for god when
[1:20:14] things happen don't just let that go
[1:20:17] because it's not worth it nothing taking
[1:20:19] your love away and your passion for god
[1:20:22] and your passion for to see others
[1:20:25] experience what you experience in your
[1:20:27] life
[1:20:28] the love of god and what salvation means
[1:20:30] what god means to you don't let nothing
[1:20:33] you know well you cannot witness to
[1:20:35] nobody because you're going through all
[1:20:37] what folks say what folks think and you
[1:20:40] can't even witness to know somebody
[1:20:41] about the love of god because you don't
[1:20:43] have it
[1:20:45] are you with me you don't have the peace
[1:20:46] of god in you
[1:20:48] how can you bring somebody for to
[1:20:50] something that you don't have yourself
[1:20:53] you need to have it what you can witness
[1:20:56] to somebody okay
[1:20:59] so let me go on to the next the sperm
[1:21:02] age in
[1:21:03] nine
[1:21:04] and ten
[1:21:05] verse nine revelation two nine and ten
[1:21:08] it says i know thy works tribulation
[1:21:11] poverty

[1:21:38] knows everything
[1:21:40] he knows what we're going through we
[1:21:42] know all our problems but why we all oh
[1:21:45] let god don't know
[1:21:47] you're worried about something that god
[1:21:49] already says i already took care of that
[1:21:52] i took care of all your sins all your
[1:21:54] nicknames i i died for that
[1:21:56] matter of fact amen what you should have
[1:21:59] is righteousness peace and joy in the
[1:22:00] holy ghost
[1:22:03] that's what you should have because i
[1:22:04] know all i know about all of that and i
[1:22:06] want none of those things to defuse you
[1:22:08] to take your power away

[1:22:29] but they are the synagogue and the satan
[1:22:30] it's a lot of fool but don't you worry

[1:22:35] nevertheless the foundation of god's

[1:22:50] like god can't see god no but he's long
[1:22:52] suffering
[1:22:53] and paul tells us to be long suffering
[1:22:55] with one another
[1:22:57] and
[1:22:58] in second timothy that paul is saying to
[1:23:00] you amen that god can
[1:23:03] prevent you save that person
[1:23:06] that's going out of the way
[1:23:08] don't don't just do them any kind of way
[1:23:10] because god can bring them back
[1:23:17] okay he says here
[1:23:19] he says fear none of those things
[1:23:22] which
[1:23:24] thou shall what
[1:23:27] i thought
[1:23:30] these things well they were killed they
[1:23:33] they were actually killed they went
[1:23:35] through some stuff i don't understand
[1:23:38] there's something wrong with this age
[1:23:39] here
[1:23:41] the the time we're living in
[1:23:44] and you listen to no matter how much you
[1:23:47] preach how much you teach people for the
[1:23:49] same like
[1:23:51] is dull of hearing
[1:23:55] they like they don't i'm going through
[1:23:58] and the things that they spend their
[1:24:00] conversation on
[1:24:03] all the negative stuff they all the
[1:24:06] stuff they went to all the stuff they've
[1:24:08] been through all the stuff they're going
[1:24:11] through oh somebody's trying to take my
[1:24:14] uh uh joy wait somebody trying to take
[1:24:16] my oh ain't nobody trying to take your
[1:24:19] husband
[1:24:21] nobody trying to take your wife
[1:24:26] somebody talking about my children
[1:24:30] you don't say
[1:24:32] that ain't nothing
[1:24:34] that i'm tall
[1:24:37] are you with me
[1:24:39] praise god that's always gonna be that
[1:24:41] way
[1:24:43] amen
[1:24:44] in the world you're gonna have
[1:24:48] but be of good cheer because i what
[1:24:51] overcome the world amen you're gonna go
[1:24:53] through some things
[1:24:56] amen you're gonna be misunderstood
[1:24:58] i'll be misunderstood
[1:25:00] we ought to be misunderstood
[1:25:03] amen people are misunderst they think
[1:25:06] you've got something against them when
[1:25:08] you love them they'll thank you
[1:25:13] are you with me
[1:25:15] so you'll never be able to explain
[1:25:17] to a person
[1:25:19] that you love them when they think
[1:25:21] you've got some against them
[1:25:23] you'll never be able to do anything that
[1:25:26] they're satisfied with long as they
[1:25:28] think in their mind they got something
[1:25:30] against him
[1:25:32] i remember a bishop used to
[1:25:34] he he gave me some solid sound advice
[1:25:39] but it's been other preachers told me
[1:25:42] don't listen to that bishop don't listen
[1:25:43] to them songs on song
[1:25:47] but when i got older i thought
[1:25:51] that bishop gave me
[1:25:53] sound as a young man he gave me sound
[1:25:56] solid good advice better than
[1:26:00] all those other voices i was listening
[1:26:01] to he gave me
[1:26:03] the best advice
[1:26:05] and you know because
[1:26:07] you because i had heard this and heard
[1:26:09] that
[1:26:10] i didn't listen to him
[1:26:12] but when i got old i said you know
[1:26:16] and when i would see him i said thank
[1:26:18] you
[1:26:20] i asked him please forgive me he said
[1:26:22] that's all right that's all right you
[1:26:24] know what i'm saying because some
[1:26:26] sometimes the per you when you get a
[1:26:28] little older you'll understand it better
[1:26:30] buying by
[1:26:31] sometimes you can be blurred and you
[1:26:34] could be
[1:26:35] misunderstood or whatever because
[1:26:38] an advice you can give is not taken
[1:26:43] why because somebody
[1:26:44] went before you the spirit
[1:26:46] and said something they shouldn't say
[1:26:49] are you with me
[1:26:52] he said fear none of those things
[1:26:54] you should suffer behold
[1:26:57] the devil
[1:26:58] shall what
[1:27:00] cast some of you in what
[1:27:03] brother brother and sister i'm hoping
[1:27:04] we'll be gone before that happen
[1:27:09] are you with me
[1:27:11] i'm hoping we'll be gone
[1:27:13] because we need if if another plague hit
[1:27:16] as as as rachel was saying if another
[1:27:19] plague hit like until corona and another
[1:27:22] one and i i think i i might as well just
[1:27:25] i don't know just get on my knees and
[1:27:26] get in the car
[1:27:28] and just start praying god i want to
[1:27:30] make sure i got it
[1:27:33] i want to make sure i got it right
[1:27:36] and i i'm at that point i said lord
[1:27:41] i i want to tell you people just keep
[1:27:42] your eyes focused on jesus
[1:27:45] nothing else in his life nothing that's
[1:27:47] in his word gonna matter
[1:27:49] just keep your eyes focused on jesus
[1:27:52] amen anything else but jesus i'm gonna
[1:27:54] tell you something it won't matter after
[1:27:57] a while

[1:28:04] know this one fighting against that one
[1:28:06] and then all of a sudden the
[1:28:07] economy the whole thing crashed
[1:28:10] the whole miracle become bankrupt and
[1:28:14] you know what'll happen you know who's
[1:28:16] going to bail him out
[1:28:20] are you with me
