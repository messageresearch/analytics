TRANSCRIPT
========================================
man I remember people having a concert down there marrying and a rattlesnake fell out the ceiling while they was having a gosip concert CU you said the see the people running Poison Poison the prophet of God talk about poison in the church how if the church is going along pretty good somebody come in and there's they shoot a little spirit in there and then and then it spread all over the PE all over the church and he said the most of the time when what you thinking the folks got something against you and all that he said a lot of times they ain't nothing but the devil nothing but the devil you'll find out if you follow it up it's nothing but the devil that's right are you with me PA deadly poison that's what the tongue is goodness I'm going tell you something we it it's time to get that poison out of individuals lives amen when you full of poison you can't function right amen my brother the other day they had to cut off his leg because of gang green so they they had no choice but because they could not get the poison out so they had to cut it off are you with me poison will infect your whole body and cause you to be so sick that you can't function now pausing in a Christian's life causes them to be so sick sin sick to they cannot function okay you want to be able to function amen as a Christian amen and a Christian cannot function if they're full of poison amen are you with me now what are you saying he said therewith we bless we God come at the tongue even the father and there with we what which are made after the similitude of God I don't like him I don't like her only thing I like is my little one and two my little crowd I get around them and I I don't want nothing to do with nobody else tongue a lot of people are they're victimized because of the tongue and they're go and they hang out with folk amen that that are are not respectable some folks to become part of gain some people uh they they they go hang out with the people that will accept them and then those other folk that think they uh Untouchable and they're so much better than others those folks will find out in life that they won't be able to function because why they think more highly of themselves than they ought to think God does not La a highminded person amen amen God resists the proud but he give grace to the what the humble isn't that right amen but uh a lot of folks don't care whether you think I I ain't got to be humble because I'm somebody special you don't never get too important that God is not the Bible say wherefore God has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name but what what did he do he said let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus and the mind that he had the Bible said he humbled themselves and became in the fashion of a man amen why to die on the cross for us amen he was humble he was God but he came down and condescend amen he didn't think himself no better amen and he became a Friend of Sinners and publicans amen they said they call him a wine begler Friend of Sinners why because the people that thought they were high minded they was in the church and they thought there was somebody special they look down on other folk amen but Jesus said I came to seek and save those that are lost amen are you with me amen so he says here in the 10th verse he says out of the same mouth proceeded blessing and what CS my brethren these things ought not to but you know I I asked the question I this morning as I was praying meditating I I asked ask the question is the mean man happy is the nasty Spirit happy does that make you happy to be nasty you know some people they they wouldn't smile you you give them $50 they might gigle the false conception you know but a main person person just carries a attitude what makes you happy what what does God has to do for you to make you happy make you feel good amen you know what I'm saying it's like what does God has to do for you some people just go in the depressed stage why because they think about the Bible say as he thinketh in his heart what so he and out of the abundance of the heart are you with me so if the if you think your thoughts are wrong then your words going to be wrong that's right if you think that you know I don't know why nobody love me if you if you give yourself a a p God loves you is that enough if God loves you well nobody loves me nobody care about me they overlook me on you thank you amen why didn't I let me come on what a friend we have in Jesus amen all our sins and greets he there man might disappoint you God never disappoint you you bless any how you blessed without those friends praise God God is has bless you it's good to be saved amen you could have been lined up in a hospital somewhere you could have been oh Lord have mercy oh ain't God good and if you don't praise him he said the rocks are cry amen okay he says my brother these things all not to be do not a found sent forth at the same place Sweet Water and what I mean come on somebody see Jesus said how can you being evil speak good things how can you being evil told those Pharisees how can you be evil speak good things you can't if you evil you ain't going to speak no good things oh I'm going tell you about sister s tell you about Brother s i don't tell you about no no no no no no no no how can you being evil speak good thing do you see anybody good yeah I'm good now why I'm telling you about all those other Devils cuz I'm so good and so holy all those Devils ain't right I'm so righteous so I'm so right you know what I'm saying don't measure Yourself by yourself is you not wise that's right are you with me amen see if you knew your condition you will never start uh you know talking down somebody else but because you can't see yourself you are always seeing somebody else fall are you with me am but when you see yourself now you you you say I got enough time I spend too much time trying to straighten out me the Bible say save yourself from this what under generation save yourself amen the Bible said that we judge ourselves we will not be judged with the world isn't that right but the M problem is we so busy judging others that we can't judge ourselves okay I'm just talking to you this morning it's all right I'm trying to take my time and talk to you a little bit okay Sweet Water and bitter water can a fig tree my brethren bring Bear all berries are you with me neither a Vine what so can no Fountain both yield what Sal and fresh salt water and fresh water are you with me you can't do both things now salt water and fresh water coming out the same Fountain amen see what I'm saying a a Christian Life ought to be one that amen will be the liks of the world Amen it should have the fruits of kindness are you with me amen it says the 13th verse it says who is wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of the good conversation his work with what nness and wisdom sometimes people are they exclude themselves amen so they're in the building but not in the church they're listening but they can't hear are you with me amen then they say to God what did you say how did he that why because their M their minds are elsewhere amen but if we can tune in a little bit and we say that the death and life is in the power of the what T tongue are you using your tongue to give life or are you using your tongue as poison Amen to kill and to destroy amen are you using your tongue to lift people up or tear folk down amen thank you Jesus to speak life amen or to speak death amen to speak good or to speak evil Amen to be a blessing or a curse amen see so many times we put curses on people when when we were little and an old person we walk past the street and you don't never want them to point their hand well we oh no you sudden and respectable cuz if a old person did this and say a little word oh Lord I'm in trouble no no we don't want that we didn't want the older person to speak on us in a negative way when parents tell their child you never be nothing you ain't no good you're nothing I wish I wouldn't have never had you you see those parents that curse their children out when they about 2 years old and they they they cursing them in the store and and anywhere you go and they'll just and then the children come up and next thing you know before they 10 years old they got them a Uzi they're trying to kill her folk why because they put all that poison in that child that's right that's right the time I go to school curse out the teacher and ain't 10 years old why because they done put all that poison in them that's right that's right you notice that people uh uh they they adopt to their environment we're not talking about Skinner and frog and all this psychology stuff but we talking about what people do are you with me people are get well they they have been indoctrinated and they have been uh uh amen they they have been uh poison and once they indoctrinated and they have been poisoned Amen in their Spirit you know poison can get in your blood and you no good my brother Nathan said they called me and it says he's got seped or whatever they not pronounce it right seped and when he got poison in your blood and said at the most they said everything is shut down the whole body was set down and they called me and said they had to put him there on the machine and everything and said he's everything is shutting down I ain't had s enough to understand what they were talking about we just kept praying and tell everybody to just keep praying amen he said he told me the other day somebody told him within 24 hours he's supped have been gone I mean 48 hours or so because everything thing was shutting down they was supposed to be poison in the blood or something and I said well but he said the doctor came in later after he's gotten stronger and looked at him he knew that was a miracle amen everybody knew God had worked a miracle in his life amen but he kept speaking I'm going be to the tent meeting he got speaking he said they tell me I won't get out to the middle of August and all of that I'm going to be the tent meeting you know what happened is that tent [Applause] [Music] meeting but you see what what happens you got to speak your way out of the condition that you're in if you want to be delivered you got
