Oh, God bless your people in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [music] The book of Genesis 37. God is good in three. As we stand for the reading, 3-10, Genesis 37 3-10. I read the first, you read the next. We'll read the 10th verse together. Now, Israel loved Joseph or Jacob. Israel loved Joseph more than all the his children because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a coat of many colors. Four. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him and could not speak peacefully unto him. &gt;&gt; And Joseph dreamed the dream, and he told it [clears throat] it his brethren, and they hated him yet the more. Six. And he said unto them, "Here I pray you this." &gt;&gt; For behold, he we were by the sheav and in the field. And lo, my she arose, and also stood upright. And behold, your she stood around and made obbyent to my she. And his brethren said to him, "Shalt thou indeed over us, or shalt thou indeed have over us?" And they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words. &gt;&gt; And he dreamed yet another dream. And behold, it was I and told it brethren, his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more. And behold, the sun and the moon, and 11 stars made a beast unto me together. And he told it to his father and his f brethren. and his father rebuked him, said unto him, What is this dream that thou has dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come and bow down ourselves to thee and to the earth? God bless you. Read this word. You may be seated. [clears throat] We want to talk this morning about dreams come true. Dreams come true. And in the book of uh Romans 8, Romans 8 and 28. 8 and 28. And for we know that what? &gt;&gt; All things work together for what? &gt;&gt; To them that love God. To them who are the what? For whom he did for know, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called, to them he also justified, and whom he justified, them he also what? &gt;&gt; Glorified. What shall we say to these things? What &gt;&gt; if us against us? &gt;&gt; God bless you in this word. Again, we thank God. If God be for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to talk for a little uh dreams come true if God be for us. For a subtopic, if God be for us. Amen. And as we look at um Joseph and his dreams, a lot of often times in life in life and in living. People dream dreams and they said, "I have a dream." We we heard that phrase a lot of times in Martin Luther King. He said, "I have a dream." And he told about the things that he envisioned that would happen. Amen. that would cause, you know, whether you're white, black, or whatever, all coming together and being one. Amen. So, uh, it's many dreams that people have. But, you know, I find out that the Bible says, uh, it's going out. Praise God. I got to look to this other, but It didn't go out. Okay. Praise God. That in the last days he he'll pour out his spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and daughters should prophesy. Your young men should see vision and old men should dream dreams. And in the light of uh old men dreaming dreams and young men seeing visions, the Bible says also without a vision the people perish. &gt;&gt; So visions are dreams are realities that uh people have and that was promised in the hour that we live in that there will be dreams and there will be visions. Amen. And I said now to every one of us sometimes we we have visions and and sometimes we look at a vision as something that's going to happen. We look for different things that we see in our lives for the future. We want to you see ourselves going, you know, go graduating from high school or going to college and you have visions that you want to be a nurse, you want to be a, you know, mechanic, you want to be this or that. You have visions of working and having a house and having a car and you know that just um things that you want to achieve or want to accomplish. Sometime we style that as a we have a vision you know things that we hope to accomplish and then other things visions when we talk prophetically or Biblewise we're talking about uh being able to be awoke. You're awoke and then it's almost like a television screen come before you, but your eyes are wide open and you see things that will be in the future that going to come to pass. So that's what you s call a prophetic gift. And if you're a prophet or a prophetist, then that means that you can see in vision. You can be wide awake and you can be looking and all of a sudden something will drop down and you can see a vision. You can see things. You see people that's this person is going to get in an accident and this is how it's going to happen. That's that's a vision. the dreams and when you were asleep and sometimes I and and sometimes I I'm asleep and I it's almost like a a movie going before you and you see this happen, that happen, this happen and it's a dream. You wake up sometimes in the middle of the night, you get your pencil and your paper and you start writing what you see. Then you date it and you put the time by and you see whether or not your dream would come true. Now I dreamed that and it may happen, you know, a couple of weeks later, may happen a month later, it may have a year later. Now the prophet when he saw vengeance and sometimes it took, you know, years down the road. So he put him in a in a book and he'll write it down because not one of his visions that he saw, every time he saw a vision, he knew that that was God speaking. Now when you know God is speaking to you and somehow how many of you know when God is speaking to you through a vision, through a dream or just something come over you and you hear the voice of God. How many of you know when that's God is speaking to you? &gt;&gt; Okay. So often times we're not a conscious that God of the of the invisible God being visible to you and making himself known to you. Now God would come down. You remember uh Samuel was sleeping and uh he thought Eli was calling him and he went to Eli uh the prophet because he was raised up in the temple and uh he was just a young man and uh and a voice called Samuel. And then Samuel thought Eli was calling him. Are you with me? How many you with me? &gt;&gt; So Samuel thought Eli was calling him. Thought uh the priest or the prophet was calling him. But it was God that was talking to Samuel. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Now when he heard that voice, he went back to sleep and the voice called again. And then he says, "Oh, you said hear my Lord." And so he realized the Lord was calling. Eli told him, "The Lord is calling you. You got to go back and tell the Lord, yes, you know, I hear you, Lord. Speak." And the Lord told him about his ministry and about what he was calling him to do. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And often times a minister feel like I have a calling to be a preacher. You know, sometimes I have children come to me and they're little children and they they have a calling. God called me to be a preacher. And uh and I said, "Okay, God call you to be a preacher, wait till you get the Holy Ghost. When you get the Holy Ghost, you can preach." You know, but they, you know, a lot of times they and so there's a there's a delay. If God call them, you know, it could be a delay. Uh I could say, "Well, God call you to preach. Hallelujah. We glad." And you might be six, seven years old, 10 years old, and you believe God call you to preach. Well, we know if you're going to preach, you're going to need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God call you to preach, then he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost, and you'll be a a Holy Ghost called preaching. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, and that's what we look for. You, you know, God deals with you in your life. Now you most preachers or the reason why they became preachers because God dealt with them in a dream. God dealt with them in a vision. Some supernatural occurrence happens in their life and and and there's a call of God. But to the normal preacher, he's smart, he's intelligent, and he went to school and he thinks he's a smart person. They got a lot of confidence in themselves and and they want to do something for the Lord. So the normal preacher want to do something for the Lord and they might be educated and they might be not be afraid to talk in front of the public or speak in front of the public. So they feel like well you know I might as well be a preacher because I can talk in front of the people and and I I feel like I can help people and I want to be help. I want to be a help to the church and a help to the people. So they go to preaching now not so much as so they've been called but they they felt like I I I want to do something good and to help the people but the co real genuine call preaching has to be you know Jesus said the spirit of the lord is upon me and for he has anointed me to what preach &gt;&gt; to preach the gospel and then he said in uh Ephesians 4 wherefore he said when he ascended up and high. He led captivity captive and he gave what? Gifts unto men. &gt;&gt; Now, uh preaching, he gave some apostles, some prophets, some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the edified in the ministry. God gives gifts, amen, to the uh the to the ministry. And that gift just as much is is real. It's a gift and it's a calling. God gives that gift to that person. Not that he goes off to school and get an education, get a degree, and he comes back said, "I've been ordained by such and such a church and I have a license by such and such and I can be a preacher." You know what I'm saying? Those are the things that happen to people. Now, we must search ourselves and know that uh all things would work together to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that all things work together to the good to them. &gt;&gt; Oh, that love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you say, "I love the Lord, but all things work together to the good, to them that love the Lord." To them who are the what? &gt;&gt; Call. You and I must feel a calling. You know, a calling on our lives as individuals, not just a preacher feeling a calling to preach, &gt;&gt; but a calling. God call you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God predestinated you. God chooses you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God called. And you're here not just to come into church. You're here because there's a true call and a true deep call to the deep. God call you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. No man that's you know you have not chosen me but I chosen you and ordain you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God made a choice. God, it's God echoing through you that you don't have to come to church, but it's something that you want to come to church &gt;&gt; because what God call you &gt;&gt; to be a saint, to be saved, &gt;&gt; to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is a call by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To them who are the called according to his what? &gt;&gt; Purpose. &gt;&gt; Purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God got a purpose in your life. Look at somebody. Tell them, "God got a purpose." &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; for your life. &gt;&gt; God got a purpose. He You're not just coming to church just to cuz this is the thing to do to be a good person, but it's a calling. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; God has called you for a purpose. Amen. And when God call you justified, glorified, and but he says, Amen. If God be for us, who can be against us? Amen. So I I I'm going to move on from that. I'm not even going to go through all of those the Romans and all those scriptures, but I want to talk to you, you know, about uh Joseph and his vision and his dream. Joseph had a dream. His father loved him. But your dream for your life even in the natural what you envision and what you want to be and what you're trying to be sometimes there all kind of obstacles there are all kind of uh stumbling blocks that will get in your way to cause you not to fulfill your dream. You know, often times a young lady dreams of getting married, having two children, a boy and a girl, and a house, and a nice Lexus, Mercedes, uh, and a nice house with, you know, this and that, and a husband that, you know, this and that, a young man, uh, in visions and dreams. Well, I have a nice wife and she's beautiful and I have a boy and a girl and uh you know I got a nice house, a nice job and um you know I I envisioned that. But you know, if everything was just so perfect, everything can align. And you maybe we'll look around and we think we see the the the perfect situation. A lot of perfect uh uh uh people that you know, a lot of things that you wish you could have and wish it could be possible for you and uh a and that's what you want for your life. But you know, you know, you might have the right kind of mindset, the right kind of desire and the things that uh uh you want to achieve and things that you would like to see happen for your life. But do you don't you know that there's a spirit as a devil there to hinder those things from happen? Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you might voice a a friend of mine, he used to talk about, you know, you know, he says, you know, Simmons, he call me Doc. Dr. Simmons, you know, we all young ministers. He said, doc, you know what I'mma do? I'm I'm going to go to Texas and I'mma have such and such or that. And he envisioned that and went off to school. He got a a a doctor degree in theology, went to Harvard, Yale, something and got a law degree, ended up doing exactly what he said and went to Texas and became this. And I I said, man, you know, some people look like things go smooth. And some people, you know, I'm sure it didn't go as smooth as it looked, but it looked like it just went clockwise, you know, and some people, you know, desired that, okay, I'm going to play professional football, basketball, and then work real hard and, you know, and look like it went so smooth. Matter of fact, IT JUST FIT JUST LIKE A a glove will fit your hand perfectly, you know, cuz they vision that and they wanted to be that. Some people, you know, I I remember Rachel since she was a little girl, probably two or I mean three or four years old, she said, "I want to teach school." You know what I'm saying? And it came on about, she she didn't just want to teach school. She want to uh help the special needs. You know what I'm saying? And as she come got to a little age like all she people ask you what you want to do I want to teach be a teacher I want to be a teacher look like everything work out she wants to be a teacher and and Caleb wanted to be a CEO or something I don't know whether he well on the way or not [laughter] in his head but hope he might be there you know so somebody grace God people have dreams and visions they want to be certain things and and and Rachel vision man she work hard she worked hard but it's a lot of things would hinder you in your work but if you have that vision if God be what &gt;&gt; if you put God first if you put God first &gt;&gt; thing you won't achieve certain things but you got to put God first &gt;&gt; amen Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and I, you know, I thank the Lord that uh uh God will allow you to achieve certain things, but if it's not the will of God, please tell God, "Don't let it happen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God, this is what I want and this is the path I want to take. BUT IF THAT'S NOT YOUR WILL, &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Please don't let it happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, things could be better for us, but things wasn't better. But sometimes the the permissit will some things happen to your life and some things trip you up and cause you to stumble and it becomes permiss will. And God will allow permissit will sometimes to work out to the good of and makes it his perfect will. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even in the mistakes and things that you make in life, &gt;&gt; even when the bad decisions that you make in life, God can take those bad decisions and cause it to work to your good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz if God be for you, &gt;&gt; who can be against you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dreams come true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at somebody. Tell them, "Dreams come true." &gt;&gt; Dreams come true. Amen. And we we want to uh we want to talk about dreams come true. Amen. The things that you desire, the things you dream. And you know sometime people don't they stop dreaming because of disappoint. It don't look like my dreams, my expectation, the things that I I want to see happen in my life. So sometimes people just give up on dreams. they give up on on trying to accomplish achieve certain goals. It's only those that will stick to it, you know, stick to what you believe your calling is, your purpose is, and what Amen. What would make you s happy? Amen. And also, you want to please God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and sometimes we give up too easy and we get satisfied and comfortable and not achieving. Now when I go back to the spiritual aspect sometime and you know I'm walking both ways you know so when I go back on the spiritual perspective of the thing when the prophet saw a vision you know he saw a vision of this person getting healed and he goes to the hospital or he goes to the home of the individual and they are dying on the deathbed. If God don't help them, they going to die. But he goes there, he sees a vision that this person going to be healed. But it that healing, Amen, took place uh that this certain person had to come in the house with a certain colored shirt on and they had to sat in a certain chair. And if that if and that person came in and didn't sat in that chair, then he could not do he could not do what God told him to do until that happened, you know. And the the prophet would wait sometime he would wait all night and then that person walk in there, sit down in that chair and then he could stand UP AND SAY, "THUS said the Lord, you're healed." OR THUS SAID THE LORD GET UP OUT THE BED and walk. No matter how they might be paralyzed, they might be whatever happen in their life, BUT HE SAID, "THUS SAY THE LORD, GET UP OUT THE WHEELCHAIR. THUS SAID THE LORD, RISE UP and walk." Because he's seated in the vision. And everything he saw in that vision happened just like he said. And he said, "Not one time out of the hundreds and thousands of time did one vision ever fail me." He said, "If it if it fail me one time," he said, "Call me a false prophet." He said, "A true prophet of God, it he never fail." If he's the true prophet of God, God gave him a dream, it would never fail. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that's what God, you know, gave us a true prophet in this age that when he spoke, nothing would fail. &gt;&gt; Nothing. When he said, "Thus said the Lord." Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because he saw it and he had a confidence that it would not fail because God, it's God. He said, "You don't have a vision on your own. Neither do you dream a dream on your own. You say, "I'm going to dream a dream tonight. I'm going see a vision today." It's something that it it's controlled by God. &gt;&gt; It's not controlled by you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, uh, in our, you know, way of thinking, human thinking, we're talking about our little vision and our little desires that we try to achieve. But what does we put it on the spiritual aspect? Let's put God up first. Dreams come true. So, Joseph dream, you know, I'm going tell you something. I've had a lot of things that I tell people. I I You ever seen somebody take your vision and your dream and jump in front of you and try to outdo you? Y'all don't y'all ain't with me. You go around and tell the wrong person, they'll jump up and they'll do it before you get to it. And when you you said, "I might as well leave it alone cuz they done messed it all up." You know what I'm saying? You had the dream and you told them about what you was dreaming of. You said, "Well, you might have had a, oh, I'mma open up some certain business and this is how I'm going to do it." You tell them all about it. They'll open up the business before you get to it. They already opened up the little shop, starting the business, and you said, "HUH? I TOLD THEM this what I was going to do." And they done beat you to it. And then they successful and they doing it. And you said, "Well, I might as well." MAN, I WAS I THAT'S I TOLD THEM about it and now they going to outdo me or outrun me. Oh, well, I don't want to do it no more. Don't you let somebody take your vision and your dream from you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You have all kind of disappointment. People that don't believe in your dream. People that don't believe in your vision. People that will try to keep you from attaining achieving what God want to use. Even yourself. Sometime you would doubt yourself. you would even doubt. You know, all you got to do is just have a little delays. You know what I'm saying? And in in your delays, sometimes you you you would you would believe that it ain't going to happen. &gt;&gt; So in your delays, you said, "Well, I don't know. Maybe this ain't for me." Now in in Habac two and and one it says sometimes things are delayed. Amen. And sometimes you because they are delayed we want it to happen you know without struggle sometimes. Sometimes you going to have struggles. I Caleb was one of the ones that said, "Daddy, pray for me." I'm having this test. Woo! This math is Oh, good lord have mercy. Daddy, please pray for me. You know, and he would come, you know, before he take a test said, "Daddy, please pray. this thing is hard. And I would pray with him but [laughter] and and God work it out and he passes. Thank the Lord. Hallelujah. Cuz some things take a struggle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and some things make you think you taking the wrong course, &gt;&gt; man. I might drop it. [laughter] You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; I might as well give up. dreams come true. Something said, "You got to speak this message this morning for a certain purpose." I said, "Huh?" Yeah. You got to say this because sometimes people would discourage you. They make you doubt whether or not you see. I I want you to let God do it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where he can get all the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will stand upon my watch, and I'll set me upon the tower, and I will watch to see what he will what &gt;&gt; say unto me." &gt;&gt; And what I shall answer when I am reproved. And the Lord answered and said, "What? vision. &gt;&gt; That's why I say in in in the middle of the night, a lot of times I get messages in the middle of the night and I said, "This message is so powerful, so simple. You know what? I ain't getting up out this bed to write that down." Yeah, I got it. I got it. And I get up. What did I dream last night? What did God? I know that was God. Goodness. I said, "Lord, next time I ain't going to do it no more. Tell me what what did I dream? What was the message you was telling me last night?" I said, "I ain't going to do it no more. I'm going to get up. I'm going to get up." I said, "Lord, please bring it back to my cuz the thing is, you know, it's getting next to you now." I said, "Lord, please." I go, "I can't hardly make it through the thing." I said, "Well, what was I supposed to TELL THE PEOPLE? WHAT WAS THAT dream about?" Then all of a sudden, I said, "God is good." He said, "Son and son, it's simple a lot of time." And he bring it back. Because when he speaks through a a dream or whatever and he speaks to you, it's better to give up, write it down, put the time, put the date, and you know, if it's God speaking to you in a supernatural way, it's going to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you don't get up, forget it. [clears throat] It It's gone. God will tell you what's going to happen on He'll give you the answer on the test. He'll tell you what what the teacher going to say before the teacher said it. He'll write all of that. You know, God will tell you things, tell you the future. You say, "Huh?" Then you realize you're getting to know God. You getting to know that God is real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God works in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and that's what we want you to get get in tune with. Get in tune with God. Some of you sitting around with with gifts that God has given you and you're not using those gifts because you know you don't even know if it's really you really gifted. You don't really know you're really gifted. You don't know that. You just think you know you're normal. But not everybody in here ain't normal. &gt;&gt; It's you you might have a prophetist in here. You might have a prophet in here. somebody that God is using in a supernatural way, but they don't know it because they think that I'm normal. You know what I'm saying? But you're not normal. You You're gifted. And you got a gift to be a blessing to the bride of Jesus Christ and to the body of Jesus Christ. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And God want to use that gift to his glory and for the edifying of the body of Christ. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he says, "Write the vision." Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And make it plain upon tables that he may run that what? &gt;&gt; Readth it. For the vision is yet for what? &gt;&gt; Appointed time. But at the end it shall what? &gt;&gt; Speak. &gt;&gt; Now he talked about the end and what the vision is going to speak. Daniel was told to seal up the book to the time of the end. Habach was told to write the vision. The vision going to speak at the time of the end. He was telling you things that was going to happen as you read the preceding chapter and so forth. Things going to happen at the end. Amen. And it it should speak and not lie. The vision is for a pointed time. It's going to speak and it won't tell a lie. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Though it tars, &gt;&gt; wait for it. &gt;&gt; Wait for it. You know, like like the prophet had to wait. He had to wait for it. He had the vision, but he had it's for a point of time. He had to wait. He saw the little boy crushed by a car and ran over. You know what I'm saying? He had to wait and it happened over in Finland and then he it came back to him. This is the vision. Fell ran over by a car. He was dead in the street. Speak the word and the fellow would come back to life. You see what I'm saying? So God showed him that before it happened, right? And God will show you things to come. That's one of the gifts of of the Holy Ghost. He'll show you things to come. He'll show you things that's going to happen before it happen. You know, and sometimes when a person have a dream and they ask the prophet to interpret their dream, he said, "I can't interpret it until I see it." And he sees the dream that they had. And when he sees it, he could even fill in the things that they left out. And he said, "Now, this is the interpretation of your dream." Are you with me? So, let's go back to Genesis and and let's I'm going so slow and y'all going to be mad at me cuz I'm going too slow. Amen. Genesis uh 40, dreams come true. And these brothers, I'mma tell you something. You don't want your dream to come true. Tell the wrong person. You tell the wrong person. Lord have mercy. You know, there's some things I saw and I I tell my wife and sometime sometime I even forget. And she said, "Didn't you tell us this and that?" I said, "Yeah." I said, "Sometimes I say, "Oh, I I forgot." See, you told us before it happened. And uh now I'm not a you know, I'm not a prophet or nothing, but you know, every now and then something happened and God let me know. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I don't call myself a, you know, none of that, you know. But I, you know, God can use you even though you're not a prophetist, a prophet. God can use you and tell you things to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; One thing a lot of times you can know things and and and people tell you you don't know what you do know. They'll convince you. And then it's a it's a lonely life when you know things that spiritual things that's going to happen and you and people don't understand you. They they actually hate you because you telling them things that you know they hate you. But you got to if if if God reveal it to you and you know it, you got to hold true to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very You got to hold true to the word of God. You take that stand for the word. If nobody lives it, you live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. If nobody want to go, you go anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have to go by yourself, go by yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter who don't want to live it or who don't believe it's right. That's right. Anyhow, &gt;&gt; stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh Lord. I wanted to get it's it's a few dreams I wanted to get to. But before I get to Isaiah 40, uh uh maybe I gone to Isaiah 40 and skip over I mean Genesis Genesis 40, but maybe I I want to go back to Genesis 20 before I get to Genesis 40. Let me just do that. Genesis 20 and 1, the dreams come true. Amen. Caleb, you want to start reading? And Abraham journeyed from hence dense towards the south country and dwell between Kadesh and Shur. And so Jiren and Gedra, go ahead. &gt;&gt; And Abraham said to Sarah, his wife, she is my sister. And AMC, king of Gar sent and and took Sarah. Now we remember that in the preceding chapter, the God comes down to Sodom to burn Sodom and Gomorrah and Abraham and Sarah. Abraham was 90 and nine and Sarah was 90 years old and an old lady. Are you with me? Now, here's a 90 year old lady and a 99y old man and [clears throat] and God come down and tells Sarah and Abraham that they going to have a child. Okay. just before Sodom burns. And this is the type of the rapture. Just before the rapture takes place, we're looking for something to happen in our lives. Now, the world has to come back to this condition. Sodom, he said, "As it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Sodom, thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed." So, we're living in the days of Sodom again. But what happened then was in shadow form and typho. But what happening now? Amen. This is reality time and it's happening again. Sodom is here. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sodom is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Pass the law. Men can marry men and women can marry women. Legalize. Oh, isn't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's here. You better not say nothing about it either. But we have to speak where the Bible speak. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; But God took Aim came to Aimilec in a dream by night and said to him, "Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken, for she is a man's wife." But Aimilec had not come near her. And he said, "Lord, without slay also a righteous nation." &gt;&gt; Now, what does a king of a nation want? A 90year-old woman. I mean, a king over a nation can have any the young brides that he can. Ain't that right? You think he want a 90 year old dried up and wrinkle woman? Huh? Are y'all with me? &gt;&gt; But here's the scripture. Prior to that, Sarah laughed in the tent behind him and and and God said he was going to visit them, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So reason why these revelations are bought out in this hour that was hidden from the foundation of the world but they bought out in this hour to get you in rapturing condition to uh uh actually to settle and stable you and that you understand the time and the hour you living in &gt;&gt; and you might be more ready to be prepared that I understand my day and the hour that I live in. And so you understand it, but the world out there and the people go to church all the time, they don't understand what day they're living in. Neither they understand the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you understand exactly where you sit and where you stand. And you know what's going on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So this is that old lady ain't old no more. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That old lady had a body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God promised that to Abraham and Sarah and they had body changes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God promised that the the Lord going to come and descend from heaven with a shout. &gt;&gt; And when God come down, you and I going to have a body change. And we believe that he's come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's here in a visible union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that we are in a progress of a body change now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting on the rapture. We are the rapture has already started. And we are part of the body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're being changed from glory to glory even by the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it may not look LIKE IT, BUT IT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY HAIR'S STILL [screaming] GRAY, BUT IT MIGHT TURN BLACK. Are &gt;&gt; you And if it does, y'all better run cuz I'm f to get out of here. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to be no. I ain't going to Hen said just washing. It'll turn black. Got some shampoo to do. [laughter] I ain't going to wash it, but I'm going to let it stay gray. And if it turn black, y'all better be doing getting ready to get out of here. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, this old man that was can't hardly walk, all of a sudden he going to come in here running. So what happened to Brother Simmon? Oh, getting his pep back in his step, &gt;&gt; getting ready to get out of here. &gt;&gt; You think it's strange, but [snorts] things will start happening with inside of you. Oought to look for a translation. You ought to look for body change. You ought to in this hour as the world, amen, is experienced Sodom and it getting worse and worse. You ought to look from glory to glory being changed because the word of God has come to change you. &gt;&gt; It come to speak, Amen. faith inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It come to Amen. TO TAKE YOU UP HIGHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND IF THINGS ARE NOT HAPPENING in your life, Amen. IS BECAUSE OF UNBELIEF. BUT IF you believed, THEN YOU KNOW THAT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] KNOW THAT GOD IS HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE HOLY GHOST IS HERE. &gt;&gt; TO give you that body change. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOT JUST GOING TO CHURCH. I'm here for a purpose. I'm looking for my body change. &gt;&gt; This thing was happening. Go ahead on. I I got to let you keep reading because uh oh I got I got to get through by 12 cuz y'all be ready to go to sleep. &gt;&gt; Okay. Said he not unto unto me. She is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and in the innocent innocency of my hands have I done this. &gt;&gt; Now he was dreaming. See dreams come true. Sometime God speaks to people in dreams. God can speak to you in dreams. You know what I'm saying? You remember when uh Joseph was getting ready to put away Mary his wife and the angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream and said, "Fear not to take her to Mary uh your wife for that." You know what I'm saying? That which she has conceited is of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; If God wouldn't have appeared to him in a dream, he would have put away Mary privately cuz he didn't want to kill her stone or to death. But God came to him and let him know this is a supernatural happening. And God has come to us privyly to make us understand that our pregnantation, amen, is the Holy Ghost impregnating us, getting us ready for our body change. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; See, Amen. God is saying the word that has come to you in this hour, you have become impregnated with the seed of God to bring forth Christ to this evil and adulterous generation. So God is impregnating you with the word like Mary. Amen. Say, "Be it unto me according to thy word." And you're saying, "Be it unto me according to your word." Lord, you said a virgin shall conceive and you're going to have a virgin church. a virgin church, a virtuous church, a church without spot or rank or blemish or any such thing. And Lord God, you are making me Amen. and you are using me and I'm one of them that you have Amen. for new &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF GOD BE FOR YOU, &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; who can be against you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm I'm part I see myself in the dream. AMEN. DON'T YOU see yourself in the dream? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. PRAISE GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT? JOSEPH brothers did not see the dream. They didn't believe the dream. But yet it the dream was what? Drew. It was true and it was coming true and they was MAKING IT HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT YET THEY DID NOT KNOW THE PART THEY WERE PLAYING in the dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But brother AND SISTER ONCE YOU RECOGNIZE WHAT PART you play in the vision of God in the DREAM OF GOD WHAT GOD FORTOLD. AMEN. That would happen OR IF YOU KNEW WHAT PART YOU PLAY. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once you know that, hallelujah. You can go with the flow. Amen. You can just flow right on along. knowing, amen, that all things work together to the good? &gt;&gt; Amen. God, if you be fought me, who can be against me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I seen Joseph. Amen. He dreamed the dream and dreams come true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he was a true prophet of God, and his dreams come true. &gt;&gt; Go ahead on and read. And God said unto him in a dream, "Yay, I know that that thou didest this in the integrity of thy heart. For I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her." Now therefore restore the man his wife, but he is a prophet. &gt;&gt; No, now the man done told a lie. He said, [laughter] "Store, give that man his wife back cuz he's a what? &gt;&gt; Prophet." &gt;&gt; Cuz he's a prophet. You mean to tell me God will honor a lying prophet? Huh? You said, "Well, God said, you he done told a lie and yet God said, get that man and his wife back cuz he's a prophet." And what? &gt;&gt; And he shall pray for thee. &gt;&gt; And he shall pray for you. You know, it it's something about when God got his hand upon your life. Even in your mistakes, when God got his hand upon your life. Now, I thank God for AMC. He didn't have an attitude. GOD, HE DONE TOLD YOU, he done told a lie. [laughter] He had an attitude. Lord, I didn't mean to do wrong. You know how you some man you told a lie. I ain't got no confidence in you. You but God said he is a prophet. Get that man his wife back. Are you with me? And he going to pray for you. That and if he don't pray for you I'm going to mess around and destroy you and the nation. But you got to obey God. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Some things we don't understand. Ain't that right? But believe it that God works things to the good. And if God be for you, who can be against you? God had a plan for Abraham's life and for Sarah's life. Amen. And he had already spoke it and nothing was going to make it the lack wasn't going to stop God from doing what he did said. &gt;&gt; So he couldn't touch her because God had a plan. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Neither can the devil touch Amen. God's promise for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once you know what God promised for your life, don't you don't you believe that the devil can make it not happen. Amen. Now, let's go to uh Genesis 40. I I I guess we got to go faster, but 40 and 12. Genesis 40 and 12. Uh let's let's just pick it up and see whether or not 12-4. &gt;&gt; And Joseph said unto him, this is the interpretation of it. The three &gt;&gt; now we we we're dealing with the buck. Joseph done got in prison. How many you know the story Joseph? He in prison now. &gt;&gt; And in the prison the butler and the baker had a dream. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And they couldn't uh they couldn't interpret the dream. I said, "Dreams come true." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's look it up. And the three branches are three days. Yet within three days, Pharaoh shall lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place. And thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup unto his hand after the former manner when thou was his butler. But &gt;&gt; okay, so he the butler. Oo, thank the Lord. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh. And &gt;&gt; how many How many of you can bless somebody and they forget all about you? They all of a sudden come, somebody blessing them with a few thousand, maybe a million dollar. You done been a blessing to them. then they go on about their business or whatever situation. You be a blessing to somebody. You've been a real good friend and real good blessing to somebody here. He interpret the dream. He said one thing about it when you get back where you supposed to being the butler, remember me. How many you know a lot of people forget you. A lot of folk forget you. And you in this Christian walk is a lot of folk forget what the Lord has done for them. &gt;&gt; They forget where the Lord bought them from. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY FORGET ALL ABOUT the things that they got because of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what God has done for them in THEIR LIFE. THEY FORGET IT. THEY GO ON and so HAPPY AND JOY WHAT GOD DONE BLESS THEM WITH. THEY FORGET ALL ABOUT JOSEPH SAID, "Now you look look man, you in the prison and God and we give you interpretation what God gonna do for you. God going to raise you back up, give you your job back." Amen. But I want you to know when you get back to the king's house and tell the king, I I I'm in here wrongfully. They done me wrong and got me in here and I DON'T KNOW SUPPOSED TO BE IN HERE. to remember me. How many you know people you know you know preaching 50 years sometime I look back I said look at all these I see people all the time I said oh you witness to people you struggled with people you labored with people don't you know they walk past you like you stranger they don't they might shake their hand praise the Lord you know give you a little puff off on the shoulder cuz they done made it. &gt;&gt; They done forgot all about you. People in life will forget you. Don't you know? But God will never forget you. &gt;&gt; He always Amen. He's going to remember you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO REMEMBER everything you done towards his name. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU IF I FORGET YOU, BROTHER SIMMON FORGOT YOU, [screaming] DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. THE GOD WILL NEVER FORGET your labor of love that you shown towards his name. Brother Gerald, &gt;&gt; GOD will never forget you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're dealing with a God that won't forget you. But the [laughter] man got back on his feet. He what? Forgot. Amen. Look at somebody tell them, "Don't forget the Lord. Don't forget to give him praise and thanks every day. &gt;&gt; It's another day the Lord has kept me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Read on, brother Kellum. And bring me out of this house. For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews. Here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, I had three white baskets on my head, and in the utmost uttermost part uttermost basket, there was of all men of bread baked meat for Pharaoh, and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof. The three baskets are three days. Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee. And the prophet had to tell Demons's carrier sister that she was going to die. And the time of her death therefore was going to be at 12:00 I think it was. And that she was going to die and not live. And get get prepared to die. You're going to die at 66 time at 12:00. He saw it in the vision and demon carry his sister which he was the head of the full gospel businessman and he was going his sister was going to die at 12:00. All of a sudden they was in a big meeting convention and a priest got up and said, "YOU SHALL NOT DIE BUT YOU SHALL LIVE." And the and the people said to brother Brano, "Hey, you hear that?" I ain't worried about that. He He said when you got thus said the Lord and you know the God is speak, you don't worry about that. You got thus said the Lord, you know what happened? She died just like he said. He told her to get her house in order cuz she going she going to die. You know what? When you hear all kind of prophets, all you want the prophet to do is tell you what. &gt;&gt; Tell me a good thing. Don't tell me nothing. You know, we come to church, we want to hear all the good things. Well, brother Simmons ain't telling me no good thing. Let me go to a church where where somebody is is preaching the truth. Cuz the truth will set you free and it'll lift you up. It won't tie you down. It won't make you feel bad. IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD. I WANT TO GO CHURCH TO THE TO FEEL GOOD. CHURCH, love is what? &gt;&gt; Correct. And sometimes you have to correct. And sometimes you speaking things and you don't know why you're speaking it. You know, if Isaiah would have thought about a virgin conceived, he would have never said it. Cuz he know good and well a a woman that don't know no man can have a baby. So why I'm going to say something like a virgin going to conceive and have a child. He wouldn't said it, but it was God. He had to speak it because God said it. Ain't that right? And sometime the preacher up PREACHING AND HE'S SAYING STUFF AND HE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY HE SAID IT. And you COME TO HIM, WHY YOU SAY SO AND SO? I don't know. Did I say that? Yeah, you said it. You don't know me. You You YOU MESSING WITH MY BUSINESS. THAT'S MY BUSINESS. I don't care who told you that. But I tell you what, you better leave my business alone. You know, sometime I was handcuffed. Sometime I said this, I can't say that. Can't say. I said, "Take these handcuffs off me." Cuz a lot of times you know things sometimes personal private thing but at the same time you come forward you got to preach it is it's not like you telling person or private thing it's that you got to preach the word and if a person know you got to preach it. Amen. Doesn't matter if it is their condition you got to preach it anyhow. I said well Lord you know I I I can't I can't be like this. YOU CAN'T BIND ME UP. Why I can't sell this. I can't do. Oh. Oh, you going to think I'm picking on you. I got to be able to preach the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And that's where a preacher held in in a place that he's got to please God. And sometimes he'll say things he didn't even know what he said. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; If if he thought about it would hurt your feeling or hurt you, he probably wouldn't say it. But sometimes he can't think about your feeling or was it going to hurt you. He's got to know the scriptures. I got to say what God says in the Bible. &gt;&gt; And if it hurt you, it just have to hurt you. Are you with me? Because it hurt me, too. Okay, I got to I don't know why I said that. Go ahead. shall lift lift up thine head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy. &gt;&gt; You think Joseph felt good telling the man you going your head going to be cut off and you going to do this? You know most of the modern day prophets or prophetist all they tell you God going to bless you. You're going to have a car. You're going to have a wife. You're going to have a husband. You're going to have this. They ain't never telling you, man, you know, I saw you and you committed adultery the other day and you did this, that, and the other. They ain't going to tell you that. They just going to tell you good things. You know what I'm saying? But some of the other things ought to be told that, you know, that exposes sin and and drive the devil out of people lives. You know what I'm saying? So, uh, let's see whether or not people say, "Oh, I would love to have a pro a prophet or prophetist or somebody with a gift." Amen. But you can have the gift of God and still, you know, be bound by people, opinion, and all of that. I got to close. Let me close with this. 41 and nine. Then spake the chief butler under Pharaoh, saying, "I do remember my faults this day." Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker. And we dreamed a dream, and one night, I and he, we dreamed, each man according to the interpretation of his dream. And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, a servant to the captain of the guard. And he told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams, to each man according to his dream, he did interpret. And it came to pass as he interpreted to us. So it was me, he restored unto unto my office, and him he hanged. Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon, and he shaved himself, and changed his reignment, and came in unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it, and I have heard say of thee that thou can't understand a dream to interpret it. &gt;&gt; And y'all know the dream that he told Pharaoh about the fame was going to come and so forth. And Pharaoh got him out of the prison and made him the man over to tell rule over Egypt and tell him how to get through the famine. Isn't that right? And then Joseph brothers and father and all came in and then they had to bow down to Joseph just like see what I'm saying. Dreams come true. Amen. Though it tar though it may take time. Dreams come true. Amen. And when God gives you dreams and visions and things don't worry about it. you you don't try to make it come true. You know, often times I talk I I tell you when you see people save and you see God deliver them. It's nothing that God just uses you. You just are part of the move of God, dreams come true. [snorts] His brothers and sist family had to bow down before him just like he saw in the dream just like they hate they hated him for that. They despised him because why? He was his father loved him and they were jealous of him and they didn't want it to. Huh? Even his dad said, "Well, mama, your mother and me, the sun and the moon, we going to bow down before you." And you see what I'm saying? Your path that you take. Sometimes it's a lonely road. Sometimes it's a misunderstood role. You as a Christian, as a believer, sometimes you're going to be misunderstood. Sometimes folks going to hate you without a cause. Sometimes people going to say, "Well, you know, you think this of yourself, you think that of yourself, you think you somebody special, you think, and those are your brothers, people that you love." They did him like that. Jesus came in the world, the world was fine. He went to his own and his own didn't receive him. They rejected him. And then Joseph got him a gentile wife, a bride. And Jesus was rejected by the Jews and got a gentile bride. Are you with me? These things happen. It happens. So, are you with me? And when these things happen in your life, are you with me? these things happen in your life. Don't think it's strange. Don't think it's strange that sometimes uh things would hinder you from your blessings and things would get in the way of the move of God in your life and sometimes it looked like amen. It things are not going to materialize and look look at how long it took Abraham and said it looked like things are not going to materialize. Things are not going to happen. But you got to have patience. Do it tar. He says what? Wait for it. Do it, Terry. Wait for it. Amen. Because you can get in a hurry and you can try to make it happen. Amen. And when you try to make it happen, how many you know it won't it won't happen. God God if God is in the business and God said, Amen. in his word, Amen. according to thy word, according to what God is written is written of me to do thy will, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let us stand. Now those this is one of the two or three hour lessons, but we tried to cut it short. Are you with me? How many of you got anything? Did you get anything this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Let us just bow. Father, in Jesus name, thank you for the opportunity to share these things with your people. Dreams come true. Dreams do come true. as [clears throat] the baker and the buckler. One came true to the good and looked like the other came true, but it caused the baker head to be cut off. Lord, the Joseph brothers didn't understand that God was going to use him to be a blessing to them. Well, Lord, thank you that Jesus came down, died for the sins of the whole world, came to reconcile man back to God, but his brethren didn't understand. But thank God for your grace this morning. That your savior, your Lord, &gt;&gt; YOUR GOD THAT COME DOWN TO DIE [screaming] FOR our sins. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. and our heads are bound, our hearts are looking unto him. How many of you would look to the Jesus and accept him as savior and as lord? As our heads are bowed, just raise your hand. Lord, I accept you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Father God, you see the hands that have been lifted up, the hearts that are open this morning. Somebody say, "Lord, we welcome you. Come into my heart this day. Forgive me of my sin, Lord. For I receive you as Lord and Savior. Thank you for dying FOR ME. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU for shedding your blood. &gt;&gt; Touch, heal, AND DELIVER. &gt;&gt; SET free by the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Since we've been limp, I ain't going to hold you up no longer. But may the peace of God remember. I think next week something is be be here with us. I think that's the fifth Sunday.
