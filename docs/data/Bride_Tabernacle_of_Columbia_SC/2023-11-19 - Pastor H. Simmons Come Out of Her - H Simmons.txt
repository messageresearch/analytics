Lord your into mercy and touch and deliver set free by the power of the Holy Ghost In The Name of Jesus Christ bless your people this morning and meet every need calling your riches and glory in Jesus Christ's name bless your word amen Revelation 18 and one it says and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice s Babylon the great is Fallen it's fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the whole of every foul spirit in the cage of every unclean and hateful birds for all nations have drunk of the wine of the rra of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchant of the earth of watches Rich through the abundancy of her delicacy and I heard another voice from Heaven s come out of her my people that ye be not that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues God bless you read word you may be seated subject this morning is come out of her come out of her we're familiar with mysty of babon in Revelation 17 and we know that she's the mother of hara Revelation 17 and5 and he said upon her forehead was a name written mystery she's a mystery but to us she's no longer a mystery amen for God has opened up and revealed to us who she is she's not a mystery Babylon is not a mystery to us we know that Rome sets on Seven Mountains Seven Hills and we know that inhered the mother of Hollows which is Catholicism are you with me amen and we know that the Protestant church was birthed out of the Roman Catholic Church becomes the daughters so the first organized religion is Roman Catholicism and everybody that followed that system became the daughters of the mother and the Bible teaches us that denominationalism and organized religion is Mystery babon the great folks are just not going to church and thinking that they're worshiping God the Bible says he'll be the temple of God showing themselves that he is God and that they actually worshiping the devil in the church and they don't even know it are you with me the Bible said if it was possible he would deceive even the very elect are you with me but God shorten the days that the elect could be saved are you with me so let's look look at it brothers sisters amen there's it's it's a mystery to those that cannot see but to us God has made amen he's revealed to us who she is so we're not ignorant of Satan devises are you with me so brother and sister God calls us out we have come out with all types of denominational systems amen we come out amen it doesn't a lot of people say well we we're not we're not a denomination we're not a organized religion but we see the hierarchy system how you have the Pope the Cardinal the archbishops and all the down a lot of churches got the apostles bard of Bishop this that got their hierarchy system pyramid system what it is to conquer the Ley liula and spirit are you with me but you look at the church in the Bible we saw no s system what happened was the Catholic Church took on Pagan Rome system put took on the church and state married together in the progam with age and the church and state became one are you with me and God Amen don't want politics in the church to be one are you with me amen God governed you by the word of God this is not a political scene amen God called you to be Christians to worship God in spirit and in truth amen yes but man wants to have preeminence and he wants to have power over you do what we say or we'll kick you out or you can't go to heaven unless you come Len we let you in heaven the church becomes your head instead of Christ instead of being led by the Holy Ghost you're being led by the bishop or by the church but we need to be led by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost going to lead you amen and it won't be contrary to the word amen yes amen because the the Bible is your absolute yes amen you must keep what the Bible says am man should not live by bread alone but by what every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God so the word of God is your absolute praise God it's not a prophet it's not a man it's not an organization not a group of people but as individuals you must work out your soul salvation with fear and trembling you are an individual God going to hold you responsible yes amen for what you believe you got to be responsible for it praise God not what brother Simmon say not what brother brandham said but what the word said amen yes and if brother Simmon said what the word say you believe the word that the prophet brother Bram said what the word say you believe the word praise God anybody say anything different than the word Paul said though we an angel come from Heaven preach any other gospel then let him be a curse are you with me so it's the word amen I can say things that make mistakes made it plenty still make mistakes but God word praise God God word will never fail you God word will never disappoint you God word will never let you down you can find fault in me you can find fault in brother Bram you can find fault in any preacher in any man but you can't find no fault in Jesus am are you with me praise God so you're responsible of keeping the word people can exalt me they can exalt the prophet but we don't want to exalt nobody but Jesus are you up man exalt Jesus Christ that's who we exal am we thank God for the preachers we thank God for the for Ministry thank God for the prophet amen not going to deny that we appreciate it amen but it's Jesus Christ amen he's the head of the church amen and he is the word amen yes so the opening of the word amen is for you and I in this hour that we live in amen we got to respect to God's word not the word plus not the word plus this and that the word is our absolute the word plus uhuh no no plus you can't add it's the word of God and this Bible is God's word not the word plus this and word plus that the word can't add to it amen when you go anywhere in they adding you know something wrong but people don't don't mind being deceived isn't that right they don't mind the word plus plus our Creeds and our dogmas amen praise God when I get off you say well the brother Simmons say amen I can get off amen but you say oh no that's the same the truth oh come on any man can get off any man can make a mistake but Jesus Christ never did cuz he is the word amen are you with me so don't don't don't don't don't don't think oh brother don't put your confidence in the church cuz the church WIll failure don't put your confidence in man cuz man will failure amen well put your confidence in Jesus Christ and he'll never fail you cuz he is the word are you with me tell people that they think you're taking away from somebody well you taking away from the pastor you're taking away from the prophet no no no no no it need to be said because sometime you go to church and you think the people worshiping man instead of the worshiping God are you up me amen but they said no no no you got to have a revelation I got to have a revelation to worship the man are you with me you don't understand oh no no no no you worship God the angel that showed us these things he saids see th doeth not I'm on your fellow servants the prophets worship God don't bow down to me Amen Let let's let's go ahead uh did I read um Revelation 175 and upon her forehead was a name written mystery of Babylon the great uh the mother hollers and Abomination of the Earth Mother when you're a mother that means you got every woman ain't a mother cuz every woman ain't got no children right well we know Jezebel had a daughter named aaliah isn't that right Jezebel was in Israel with Ahab and aaliah was in Judah are you with me her daughter as that was Shadow and types and shadows amen then it comes the reality form in our day isn't that right so we see what we have come in contact with we it's an adultery system that we're dealing with and it's been exposed by the opening of the word are you with me well we go to church clap our hand long as we shout and dancing we don't need to know nothing all we need to do is come to church shout and dance Hallelujah everybody going to heaven no no no no the Bible say you should know the truth if Jesus would not come the Pharisees would go on and say we right the Sadducees say you right but one day amen the voice of one cry in the wilderness came out and he said repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand that was John the Baptist he was he had the spirit of Elijah come telling the people to repent are you with me did the people repent no amen no and when John pointed out Jesus the lamb to take away the sins of the world they killed him but it was all it it was all right because that's what they were supposed to do they were supposed to reject him and kill them ain't that right cuz the word said he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastising of our peace was upon him with the stripes we were healed if we if he didn't die we wouldn't be healed if he didn't die our sin wouldn't be forgiven but because he died our sins could be forgiven because he he died amen we could be healed thank you Jesus oh I'm excited about God being so good to me amen I told him in Sunday school it's good to know amen how much he loves you how much he cares for us to open our eyes we could have been blind like the rest of the world but God let us see amen that is not just going to church it's the word amen yes Lord Jes it's not just shouting and dancing but it's the word we don't want to get into Pacific but by the grace of God let's go to uh 2 Corinthians 6 come out of her amen my people God called his people the church is to call out ones and God called his people out of Egypt in the days of Moses Moses saw a bush burning and wasn't being consumed and he drew nigh and Moses was told that I heard the groaning of my people I heard that cry brother and sister I don't know how long you've been crying amen but there was somebody that was crying because they were in bondage there was somebody was sing and crying wanted to get out of the bondage that they were in praise God I don't know about you but one day I was bound one day I was amen bound sometimes we bound with invisible chains sometimes we are bound down Amen to the demon powers of the earth amen and God Amen wants Amen to set the captive free amen but God sent Moses down there and told amen the Egyptians that had them bound amen amen I want you to go down Moses and I want you to tell pharaoh to let my people go amen I believe God has sent Jesus Christ into the Earth today amen when the demons and Devils have had us bound and He sent Jesus Christ to set the cap free set at Liberty them that were bruised I want to set you free from whom the son is set free is free indeed praise God I don't know what your hangup is all about I don't know what to bound up with but God wants to set you free oh yes I believe that he came that's the reason Jesus came amen he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he's anointed me to preach the gospel amen he wants to set at Liberty he wants to set you free yes but you got to war amen I believe that those there there there have been chosen folks that was chosen in a day to hear the gospel trumpet

from among them I tell you if you don't come out from among them you going to be one of them are you with me can a man put fire in his bosom and not be burnt are you with me so the Bible tells you to come out from what it's time to do something about your walk should I walk away from my close tight buddies my friend my family what I what what do I have to give up if any man come after me let him deny himself sometime we hold too close to that which God tell us to let go you know one thing about leaving Egypt a lot of times their trouble was they look back what's wrong with coming out of Sodom God told them don't look back when they look back they got scared are you with me I'm going tell you something when God save you don't look back don't look behind you cuz he said your sins and iniquities I ain't going to remember them no more when God get through washing you and clean you up don't even worry about what happened back in the past you you you you know sometime people so busy worried about the past till they can't walk in their future to all the blessing that God got for you he got a promised land flowing with milk and honey but if we look back we'll never be able to go forward the children of Israel was trapped in the wilderness because they look back to Egypt made a golden calf and all that stuff I remember how it was in Egypt no no no no don't look back go forward okay I got to try to come to a close come out of her come out from a what if people don't want to serve God and you want to serve God just come out from among them they don't want to serve God and you want to serve God and know you you smoking no more dope drinking no more liquor I'm trying to save them you can't save nobody but yourself praise God let your light so shine what Minister see your good works and glorify your father was in heaven your light will shine when your light shine it'll it'll draw if I be lifted up I what I draw all men don't worry about you God a draw are you with me your light shine and they come praise God y'all all right I wanted to preach I'm so happy and excited I wanted to run around the church this morning are you with me but I'm talking to you talking to you because time is winding up God want you to know oh goodness I got some things I want to tell you cuz y'all y'all some lovely people God love y'all don't y'all know that you're the apple of his eye amen God will never forget his children his love for you more precious than gold wherefore come out from among them and be what I didn't say that God said that ain't that right it's hard to be separated isn't that right well I work with them I do this I do that separate yourself you reason why people can't get the full blessings of God because they don't want to pay the price we hold on
