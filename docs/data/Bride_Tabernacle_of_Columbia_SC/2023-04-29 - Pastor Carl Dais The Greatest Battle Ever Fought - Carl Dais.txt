appreciate you we bless thank each and everyone and the rest of their way out tonight Lord I pray that they come with an empty Cup tonight that you would fill it up for we love you now in Jesus name amen as we stand tonight Book of Esther 4. Esther 4 and 13. kind of in the middle of my sermon here started on last Sunday Esther 4 and 13. you have it say Amen then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shall escape the King's house more than all the Jews for if thou all together hold this thy peace at this time then share their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this may the Lord add a blessing to The Originals which you may be seated for who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this amen appreciate each and every one of you to press your way out tonight for such a time as this our thought tonight the greatest battle ever fought we want to deal with the mind and I was God kind of moved me off it a little bit I'm going to the unveiling of God but I want to work with the mind now because it's been a few weeks the mind the greatest battle ever fought is faulty in our mind so Mordecai began to tell Esther you in the King's house and you think you're going to escape this wrath that Haman have put upon them that the king signed and sealed it with his own ring that they will destroy the Jews in 27 provinces but he said and then look what Esther's began to say she said that uh then Esther made them returned to Mordecai this answer go and gather together all the Jews that are president shushan shushan and fast for me and neither eat nor drink three days or nights and I also in my meetings were fast likewise and so will I go into the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish so tonight we're looking at coming to the kingdom for such a time as this you know the devil is Raging and we want to look at the the three elements of the of the of the greatest battle ever fought we we we're dealing with the body when we know the sea taste here smell feel and the illness to the spirit imagination conscience memory reason and affection but down in that Soul realm we want to deal with that and we want to kind of interchange it with the mind because Proverbs say out of the abundance of the heart the mouth begin to speak so everything that's in your heart you're going to speak it out so in there is only free Mall agency which means you believe the word or you doubt it and the Holy Spirit has to come in there for you to hold to that word so when you hold to that word from your soul your heart as the prophet of God said down in this heart there's a little compartment about the size of a quarter and that's where you think from that's where you believe from that's you that's the real you tonight and that's what believes the word you believe it from your heart and if the holy spirit is not there you will have you won't be able to believe you begin to think you have faith that presumes but it won't be genuine faith that stands alone and say it's my victory Chronicles 28. Chronicles First Chronicles 28 and 9. and he said thou Solomon my son knew thou know thou the god of thy father and serve him with the perfect heart and with a willing mind a perfect heart and a willing mind for the Lord searches all the hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts for if thou seek Him He will be found of thee but if thou forsake Him He will cast thee off forever so when you begin to look at God you seeking god with your whole heart tonight and the devil knows each and every one of us if we believe the word he knows each and every one of us if we're going to stand on his word tonight and dealing with the heart God Mercy tonight we got to know who we are you know your brother called me this morning he said brother Carl we had such a good bible study on last Saturday at work today and he said the lady her niece said she don't want us to come back I told sister Keisha her mom looked like in such a great condition she said we want to hold off from y'all coming back to Bible study because it's such a presence of God was in there because it was so so much humility seeing her in her condition that God was doing something so when people see that you focus on what God is wanting to do with you then sometimes they want to back up and say I don't want to do this I don't want to do that we said nothing to her about how to live or nothing but she got as brother Johnny said today she got a little scared a little fearful I said we're coming in the name of the Lord so the greatest battle of a fault now in your Minds tonight you know whether you want to serve God or not you know whether you want to continue with God or not in your heart tonight you know whether the baptism of the Holy Ghost is there tonight and you want to go on with God tonight see in our minds we plead with God sometimes in our heart we plead with God that God I'm just going to church with my parents I'm just going to church with my husband or my wife but you know in the inside whether you want to serve God or not you know from the inside of the inside that God I love you God I'm going to surrender to you God I'm going to trust you and I'm going to take you at your word and when you believe like that God can't do nothing but bless you first Samuel we're gonna look at some a man here that really had the heart of God and when he got the heart of God no demons or no Devils can stand in his way because that man heart has been cemented into the kingdom of God's presence first Samuel 17. and eight and he stood and cried until the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in a raid am I not a Philistine and ye the Servants of Saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us and the Philistine said I defy the armies of the of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together and when Saul and all of Israel heard these words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid see when he heard what the Philistines said they were dismayed and greatly afraid see God knows tonight whether you want to go all the way with him he knows tonight whether you just Venture without Authority or you come genuinely God I want to serve you God I want to thank you God I want to bless you God I want to do these things now let's go to verse 20. and David rules up early in the morning and left the Sheep with the keeper and took and went as Jesse commanded him and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to fight and shout it for the battle for Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in a ray Army against Army and David left his carriage in the hand of The Keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brother and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion Philistine of gav Goliath by name out of the armies of the Philistines and speak according to the same words and David heard it now see he did this 40 days but David heard him that day see the devil is telling you he got control of you every day in and out I'm making you do what I want you to do I got control of your life I keep you mean I keep you angry I keep you perplexed I keep you despair I got control of you but this day there was a man of God he heard filled the Philistines what he said and David heard him now look what he says and all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him and was so afraid and the men of Israel said have ye seen this man that has come up surely to divide defy Israel he is come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in Israel I said Lord where are we going what we doing Lord we got to do more than what we used to do I said Lord I begin to pray and as we had the ministers meeting on Tuesday the law said we got to do more I heard the pastor say about humility and I said Lord that's where we got to be so the Lord said you just got to pray not an hour you just got to pray until I'm finished with you praying if it's two hours three hours early in the morning God you got to pray see we trying to get somewhere with God and God has to see a certain faith in our lives and then he can come on the scene and begin to meet our requests sometimes it's three four hours of prayer early in the morning in the middle of the night he wake you up and pray it's got to come to a point that we're doing more than what we are doing we just can't stay where we act it stay on me where we at we got to do more than we're doing for God for God to come on the scene I told his sisters on Saturday I said now we can create the right atmosphere God only comes when the atmosphere is created and when the atmosphere is created then God comes on the scene and he lets us know that he's pleased with our worship God told me an hour that might not be enough for you two hours it might not be enough where were we going are we just church people every morning sometimes I'm riding on the road I passed by the BP gas station and I see the Jehovah Witness out there eight o'clock in the morning in the middle of the morning eight o'clock to 12 in the ball and he passing out tracks and flyers and the Lord said now what you doing rebuke me I'm driving what you doing for the Lord if the denominations can do that what can we do God is looking for more from us not the things of the world yes it's good to go to school it's good to get a good job yes it's good to have a nice house and a nice car but what are you going to do with this Jesus that's called Christ he's on your hands tonight what are you going to do with him tonight I said God help me to cry out but most of all helped me to get on my knees that I can see God yes you got preachers doing all kind of stuff running here and there doing all kinds of but God what you want me to do show me what you want me to do God and let me get in that atmosphere and that please that I can be used of you Lord I told the brothers at the church I said let's pray from 8 30 to 10 30. every Saturday I said Lord we got to get somewhere if you want God to do something you want God to do something for you you got to get along you don't have to talk to nobody get along by yourself in your secret closet and say God I need a fresh out point of the holy ghost in my life God lord I just don't feel the anointing like I used to feel it when I witness and I preach but Lord it takes something else God said you got to do more than what you used to do if the enemy if if the Bible says gross Darkness has come upon the Earth and gross Darkness upon the people that means you got to shine even brighter so that means you got to do even more to let God know that you uh please you he's pleased with your worship God is looking for us to do more we'll read something here I read to the church that inspired me one of these books brother Simmons gave me amen The constraining Power of Love must be in the preacher as a projecting eccentric and all commanding self oblivious Force the energy of self-denial must be his being his heart and blood and bones must go forth as a man among men clothed with humility abiding in meekness wise as a serpent harmless as a dog the bonds of his servant with the spirit of a king a king in high Royal independent bearing with the Simplicity and sweetness of a child the preacher must throw himself with all abandonment of a perfect self-empting faith and a self-consuming zeal into his work for the Salvation of men let me read that again and it's self-consuming zeal into his work for the Salvation of men heartily heroic compassionate Fearless models must be the men be who take hold of and shape a generation for God if they be timid time Seekers Place Seekers if they be men Pleasers or men fear us if their faith has a weak hold on God or his word if their denial be broken by any phase of self and the world they cannot take hold of the church nor the word I said Lord I Thank you sometimes I have to say things on Sunday morning that I I don't want to say but it's to get the people right I said I didn't come down here by your inspiration just to start a fellowship but God if one soul is saved for your kingdom I've done the work that you've called me to do God said you got to get on your knees and pray and you got to do more than you did last year you got to do more than you did last week we got to get so close to God that God saved them that around us God begin to work I can tell you tonight church I had Bible study with my co-workers on the job and a few of them supposed to come tonight he said but pray preacher I'm scared to come around these Saints because they might jump on me he's because I call you the devil I call you busy bug he was asking me about serpent seed I said well this is how it goes and he said you ain't nothing but the devil I said Thank You Jesus I said if did God want me to be the devil I'd be pleased to be the devil if that's what he want me to be another guy looked to say I've never heard that before and see Jesus if you love Jesus like you supposed to love him no matter if he casts you away you're going to serve him and I told them I said if it wasn't a god living a Christian Life is better than living the world and earrings and tattoos and all this stuff hair hanging out your head and everything doing everything except for what God has called us to do I said you know what if we can't live for God God ought to just wipe us off the Earth right now if we can't live for him and praise him he don't need us I told the church God don't need us if we can't come to praise him he don't need if we can't come to worship him if we're making just a church denomination out of worship God wants to worship a true sign is always overlooked when the people of God has failed God and went to the world and looked for the form and Fashions of the ministry but they feel God why that true sign that they saw they didn't recognize it to be the sign of God didn't recognize it as their token they didn't recognize it as their garment their wedding garment they wrecked they haven't recognized the true sign that Jesus spoke behold I send you Elijah glory to God he didn't send him to you for the flesh he sent him to you for the spirit that you might clothe yourself in glory which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and your mind might be the mind of Christ how you get the mind of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the prophet of God said your faith cannot reach there in the greatest battle ever fought until the Holy Ghost comes and confirms your life in the power of God you don't have the faith that it needs to overcome the world he said the Holy Ghost brings that type of faith that is the faith which is perfect Faith tonight to overcome every circumstance and every condition because now you're not speaking from the head you're speaking from the heart and now God you tell the devil in the name of Jesus Christ you defeated and when you trust God like that in the midst of all those situations like David said I'll take your head off glory to God as Joshua began to tell son stand still Moon over agilon I'm gonna take these enemies out you got to be that same way yeah you're not fighting a physical being but you're fighting a spiritual warfare now God the devil is trying to give you a delusion of church or order but you are fighting a spiritual warfare now and the devil wants to take your time and if he can get your time he got your soul God wants your time and glory to God he wants your time when we with him and when you can get away with God and serve him and not watch television the stories I was a young man and my sister had it on Days of our lives in another world and Young and the Restless glory to God but I'm telling you if you can get away from the things of the world and get away from the cell phone and say God I'm gonna put this phone down for a week and I'm gonna pray for the same time I'll be on my phone and watch won't God move I told little sister said it I said we got to get these children saved before you give them a cell phone that's because the cell phone gonna occupy them eight hours or more a day they sleep with it they got it all the time I went and get some groceries from Kroger's and the lady that customer said yeah say Mr Dave you left your phone in the buggy in a parking lot I got it is you coming back to get it I said I get it tomorrow after I get off work that's because that phone is nothing but the devil nothing but the devil I put the Bible on it and I clicked the Bible and it want me to buy some ads come to buy ads I come to hear the word of the Lord every time I click on it to hear the Bible or the message whatever I'm listening to he got an ad for me to click on and say bye now amen so Jesus he wants your heart that's the only way he can control your mind he must have your heart and in that heart there must be pure unadulterated love let me read something here prayer is a great gift not a popular gift a rare gift prayer is not the fruit of natural talents it is the product of faith of Holiness of deeply spiritual character men learn to pray as they learn to love perfection in simplicity in humility in faith these forms its Chief ingredients novice in these graces are not adapted in prayer it cannot be seized upon by untrained hands graduates in Heaven's highest School of Art can alone touch its finest keys raised its sweetest highest notes fine material fine finishes are requisite Master Wegman are required so a master Workman is required in prayer you know if you get your master's degree a master Workman is required for me a journeyman cannot execute the work of Prayer a mere gentleman can't do it the spirit of prayer should rule our spirits and our conduct amen Spirit of prayer should rule our spirit and our conduct the spirit of prayer chamber must control our lives or the closet hour will be dull and lapless always praying in the spirit always acting in the spirit of prayer these make our praying strong the spirit of every moment is that which in part strength to the closet communion it is what we are out of the closet gives victory or brings defeat to the closet so when you pray in the closet and you act unseemingly out the closet if the spirit of the world prevails in our non-closet hours the spirit of the world will prevail in our closet hours and that will be a vein and heartful Force see God is looking for someone that's going to pray as the end time is closing in on us you ain't got time to do nothing your time is Zapped your energy is Zapped but you got to Fall Away and find Jesus you got to fall away and find Christ you find yourself when you ain't preed in a whole week you find yourself where you having contact God and the devil pushes you further to the things of the world yes education is good but I found out it gets you further away from God if you're not focused on what the prize is because we ain't taking nothing on the other side but our character the prophet said so now you must be focused on what the word said focus on what the kingdom is doing focus on what God has called you to do amen I tell the young people I said you can go to school get a degree I said but if you go there and you don't pray you can have fingernail polish on you have lipstick on you have earrings on because now the world is corrupting you because the strong man is gone strong man is gone the only way the strong man can stay there is prayer there we got to watch ourselves and guard our spirit that the strong man never leave but the strong man will walk away if prayer goes so the only way we can keep the strong man there it must be the Holy Ghost it must be the genuine Life of Christ and that Life of Christ is God in you you veiled from the world you unveil you failed to the denominations the unveiling of Christ is in you wow you look like Christ you act like Christ you talk like Christ you crisis you don't want to hear nothing but what the word said and when you come out of prayer God I want to be anointed I want to be inspired that's what I can see tonight by Pastor Simmons he's a brother called if you don't do nothing be anointed pray to be anointed I thank the Lord for his presence and his grace in helping me telling me things that didn't feel good to my flesh but was good to my soul I said Lord I got to get there I got to get to that place but I'm telling you tonight church we got to reconsider we got to reevaluate our Christian Life whether we are getting along with God or not don't ask mom and dad and sister and brother to go pray with you get in the corner and pray yourself little Earnest get in the corner and pray yourself because trouble is out there waiting for you and the trouble is out there and the devil is Raging now he wants to make you do everything that he wants you to do but if you get away from God you'll do it but why are you here said Lord I'm gonna get something while I'm here I ain't coming to church for nothing I'm coming to make the preacher preach I'm coming that God will anoint me will give me what I stand in need of I need a fresh outpouring of the Holy Ghost I need a surge of God in my life I don't want to talk about no foolishness I don't want to hear no food all I want to hear is God the guys at work they talk to me they said preacher you don't want to hear nothing about the world all you want to do is talk about the Lord and maybe your garden you get me off the Lord they start talking about my garden I said now let's talk about Jesus a little bit I said because it's the spirit the spirit of Christ one of the ladies at the job said he's a rough man I said why she said oh you talk about is Jesus in the morning why we eat breakfast I said what you want to talk about naked women and all this stuff they be talking about what is the best to talk about what is the best to talk about brother Fred's son there he said boy they're talking about the Lord I said when God when you create an atmosphere and you love God that's what makes the difference Church that's what makes the difference Proverbs 16 you don't have to go there to be slow to anger see prayer keeps you from being angry prayer keeps you humble prayer keeps you that you can hear some things that might be not good to your flesh but good for your soul you might not know it now but it'll be good to you you see my mom and dad told me stay out the street son stay out the street take care of your wife stay out the street don't do those things amen I got the Colombian and Pastor say the same thing see how decree Street get the Holy Ghost that's what's going to keep you the holy spirit is going to keep you and I'm telling you tonight you that don't have the Holy Ghost develop a prayer time say God I'm going to get the Holy Ghost don't be ashamed that you ain't got it because many people got it that's older than you that don't have it said I'm going to develop a prayer time and God I'm going to pray unto the baptism by the Holy Ghost comes inside of me and not me knowing it but you're gonna confirm it to me can a nine month lady say she ain't pregnant and don't know what she know she pregnant and when the Holy Spirit impregnated you you have no more head knowledge but it's heart knowledge it comes from the heart now and that's the way you do it comes from the heart we got brothers that be in the church after the service doing the service just crying out said I want more of God I said God I hate a prophet of God say if somebody ain't hiding or crying something is wrong with my Ministry you want people to get closer to God see we got to get out of the church church entity and family stuff we got to get closer to God amen and I tell my family I said well uh sometimes I get I get ridiculed and I get treated bad with the family but I said Lord I Thank you I had family members that encouraged me out since I've been down there that come right to the church praise God I said take off their pants if you come into church God bless you I'm telling you the truth you see what I'm saying I preached to him get away from these sinful things and watch God bless you because when sickness come you want to know where you stand with God you want to know that you just don't have regular Faith you got Prevailing Faith you got perfect faith that overcomes faith is our victory tonight and when you look at it imagination conscience memory reason and affection you look at these things God has to operate in these things that six it's his faith it has to operate all these things and when it operates these things then now you in tune with the word and the word is God and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the Bible said we beheld the glory after all the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth because the law came by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ so when you standing on that word in your heart then God is able to bless you God is able to walk in such a presence and such an anointing in your life that now you can say the resurrection is here God I'm looking for the resurrection where's the resurrection it's in me now I want to see the power of the Resurrection I want to see the power of God in my life I just don't want to go to church I want to see the resurrection power in me until somebody takes a hold to it prophet of God said the brother was on the train he got on the train and everybody around that preacher or that man began to cry out and repent of their sins because their life and the anointing that was on that man that's what I need at the very presence of God be upon you my co-worker came back to me the next day he said I'm sorry for calling you the devil I said don't worry about it I love you just to say I said must Jesus better cross along and all the world go free there's a cross for you there's a cross for me I said simple scriptures like baptism in Jesus name I said now Paul came to the epicles of Ephesus find certain disciples saying have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe he said we're not ever heard of any Holy Ghost he said then where were you baptized he said John the Baptist the baptism of repent of saying that they wait on him would you come out there which is Christ the lord and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus I said no way in the scriptures was anybody ever baptizing father son the Holy Ghost I said some of these truths in the Bible I said I don't understand why you can't believe them and they're ready in this scripture I said but it takes the Holy Ghost and his soul to believe it you got to believe from the heart you got to believe from the heart and this Harvest Time Has Come in Church Harvest time is coming and you're going to have to show your hand you're gonna have to show your hand what you believe because guess what if the Holy Ghost says it's not in the heart your hand gonna have to be showed you're going to have to show whether you believe God and whether you believe the word you're gonna have to show your hand and when your hand is shorter the devil Gonna Know Who You Are he knows who you are tonight and all you got to say Lord I Thank You for Your Mercy it's harvest time now everybody's going in their position and they're going in their position where they're going to be I said but Lord let the Holy Ghost come and reveal himself in such a way yeah that the revelation of Jesus Christ might Elevate us into a place that the power of the Resurrection might take full root in our lives through our prayer life and as you pray you're gonna die that's why people don't want to pray yeah and when you pray you're going to die to your self and all your ideas and your thoughts and the Very power of Jesus Christ is coming inside of you and that will be the Wonder working power of God and that's what's going to take you over that's what's going to take you I tell my son I said God would do for you that you can't do for yourself the Bible says he's strong that executed his word Jeremiah 32 and 16 said is there anything too hard for the Lord there's nothing tonight too hard for the Lord I told a sister on Saturday I said he can raise Lazarus from the dead four days thinking in the grave your situation is not that bad I said when you create an atmosphere God will come on this scene she said amen thank you Lord I don't know what kind of condition health-wise that she was in I know she's bedridden but I told her daughter and her sister I said if we can create the right atmosphere God Ado exceedingly and abundantly we got to take God out the box and bring him right where we at 3731 Martin Street but our prayer do it you get a church in prayer and God gonna generate love in their heart not tongue speakers but a prayer life don't complain about what you got to do just pray don't complain about what you got to go through just pray because the Bible said if Jesus bear to cross along and all the world go free notice a cross for you there's a cross for me amen I had my superintendent on the job I was treating me kind of rough I knew it was a spirit but I said Lord everything you see I say yes yes sir amen amen amen he went in the kitchen drop his drink and feed her down and I come up there and saw the water all over the floor he said Carl you know what you're a good man she's a good man see God want to see just how much you can take he want to see how much you can suffer how much you can take from the world and the things of the world now everybody look and say that man act like he love you cause everybody else real back at him but I accepted everything he had to say and the director come back and said man I don't know what you did to the superintendent he said but man he'll go back for you I don't care where you at he can't say nothing bad about you because I let him talk and do me just like he wanted to do me and God has sinned sometime that Pastor to hurt your feelings then you'll stop praying or brother or sister or wife or husband see prayer helps you to die see most problems with us we don't want to die we want to be half dead covered up half dead covered up half covered up but still living but I'm saying tonight let the Holy Ghost give you your death certificate let him give you your death certificate die no matter what somebody say about your children your wife your family no matter what they say about you die a priest is sermon about two months ago three months ago perfect strength through perfect weakness my mom was sitting right in there I said my mama ain't nobody I said Mom you ain't nothing my sister I said you ain't nothing I said my wife you ain't nothing none of your family nothing the Simmons family ain't nothing today's family ain't nothing and I said I ain't nothing and they were so shocked when I said that when you've realized that you nothing and the prophet of God said don't rise above it see when you think you something you can't take what people put on you you got to realize God is showing me in prayer getting up two or three o'clock in the morning waking me up they pray to time to go to work sometime God said you ain't nothing and once you realize that then I can use you when you think you somebody then God can't use you that's in the mind see our mind he said he been in some places when he's with real men they were real men Giants and then he went in some places where a man just had about a few suits he was so puffed up that he was somebody he but I went into monarchs and kings and places these were real men were so humble then he went with that man just got to change your clothes and maybe 50 people in the church are hundred and you couldn't tell him not a novice God is showing me now you got to humble yourself you got to get to a place where I don't care what nobody say to you or do to you you got to die and the Holy Ghost will come then like it's yours yours think we got a holy ghost but it's a ghost but it ain't holy but once somebody do you wrong then it reveals I said Lord let me die the guys how you let the man talk to you like that I said what about that don't worry about that glory to God my children talk to me like that sometimes my wife she give me a good whipping after sermon sometimes let me die the more I can die the more God can be glorified I didn't come to Camden to play games I come to somebody might be saved I come to save my family them that's ordained to eternal life I said that's what I come to do I didn't come for no other reason I didn't leave this church for no other reason I could have stayed here and been a preacher and been all right but God said go for 10 years I stayed here 20 years I stayed at God said go I said well I better go now before you take my life go I need you to go oh that will heal you that's who can be saved and I I cried many nights because I didn't want to leave I didn't want to leave here but God said go but see most people don't know that they figure I just got up and go that's a blessing but I cried many nights because I didn't want to leave here I've been here 22 and a half years I didn't want to go but God said I need you to go because they need to hear the word of God and I'm telling you tonight you ain't no different in my family it's remembered Camden area I love you with the pure heart every one of you I do anything for you let's get closer to God where the Holy Ghost is using us in your help to the pastor and these Ministers of the Gospel I found out that a true family of God that people that really love God better than jewelry they better than gold tonight if you got a brother like brother Gordon brother like brother Ernest brother Gerald brother Jeremiah brother Fred sometime brother Fred's son peek at me said you're my dad and I'm the brand of mites whatever happened to get to God but he don't know it's the reveal word we're not following a man but the son of man without the Holy Ghost you'll follow a man but with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you know he's this there as eloisa pointing you to Isaac which is Christ in us the hope of glory god above us Jesus with us Christ in us the Holy Ghost the power of God that he told Nicodemus you must be born again not of water not us but of the spirit of Christ you must be born again that's the only way your Eternal destination is sealed God bless you [Applause] May appreciate the word tonight amen God is good amen [Applause] the greatest battle ever fought I like one thing he says that you know good having good Brothers is more than all the jewelry worth more than all the jewelry all the gold that you can have just to have Fellowship somebody that's going to pray for you amen don't call your name in prayer that that means more than anything you know sometimes you look at family and what is your what is your family you know a real family you know those that are bear across with you y'all believe that tonight those that you know stand alone with you sometimes I was telling somebody that they came to my mind I said you know everybody's going through something right now I told them that I says you know sometimes we don't know but because we don't sit down and talk to people long enough I said but everybody's dealing with something I said some people trials you can just see out in the Forefront others you can't see because you won't know unless they tell you I says but you know sometimes you might think you're the only one you might think you're the only one going through I says but you sit down with with people long enough and you'll find out sometimes that you ain't the only one going through that we all fighting a battle like I said this week you might can just see yours but sit down with somebody long enough and you'll find out that we all need to pray for one another we all need to hold one another up in prayer amen we all need to keep the name of Jesus in our mouths for the next man y'all believe that tonight God is so good the greatest battle ever fought amen and you know he's hitting those highlights talking about how important Holy Ghost is you know I believe the scripture says that Darkness was going to cover the Earth Earth and gross Darkness amongst the people but he says arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee the dark it get out there that's the more we're looking for God's glory and the more we're looking for is Grace depending on him to be more to us than we ever you know uh uh thought we ever needed amen I was looking at us sharing with um them in a Minister's meeting the other day you know and my son's school and how they the boys was fighting one day and next day the boy come out there with a knife and stabbing a couple of other students I said that if he could have got his hands on the gun he'd have brought a gun to school but just thinking about those things I said this is the hour that we're living in the hour where we're living in where other people not only is their minds going insane but the young people they're having real mental battles they're they're having real things that they have to fight and deal with that you and I as individuals might even have to deal with at that age but that's the much more we're going to have to have God's protection and the plot of blood over our homes and over our children over our families because we can't be with them there all the time you know my wife was telling me about a situation how the two children was fighting in the Bus Loop and somebody did a drive by shooting just shooting in the crowd I says but nevertheless we look at all those things and what else can we do but look to God we got no other choice now in the hour that we live in but to look to him he's our only hope not only salvation he's the only keeper the only one gonna watch over him the only one that's going to keep them not only do they have to battle like he says all that but you got sicknesses you got all these things hitting that one time you if you try to uh put it all in your mind your mind explode but we don't look at those things we look at the victory that God has already brought in our lives we look at the promise that God has made us and how he promised to keep us not only us but our children our whole house as long as we keep that blood applied so it's in our best interest a lot of times to stay with God come on because if you if you was to leave God because remember he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you no nor forsake you but if you was to leave him and leave from out under God's umbrella you imagine what the devil will do to your life or what he could do to your life the only reason why he hadn't done the things that he want to do or he desire to do your life is because you under God's umbrella and all those fiery darts and things that he's shooting he can't penetrate the umbrella that God has got you under he can't make it through that blood so I thank God tonight thank God for his grace thank God for the word that we heard tonight amen God is good amen the greatest about I ever fought thank God for about the call amen fought in the mind amen so let's keep fighting a good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life God is good with guys Reverend wolfier say something right here you all right thank God for him amen press in his way Amen Let Us stand tonight God is good you appreciate the word tonight there's somebody that heart's been touched you want Brian tonight believe God did deliver you tonight and you want to come up and say Brother come on brother Ernest and y'all pray for me anybody want praying tonight anybody want to give their life to the Lord tonight you're not giving your heart to Jesus I think we all need to pray more are you with me the Bible said pray without ceasing men ought to pray always praise God said a lot of things that we've been dwelling on and saying to the Saints amen as long if it's anything that God wants us to be it's humble people humble we can all be more humble are you with me and that's what God is calling for humility so we thank God for the message tonight prayer and humility when you're humble there ain't gonna be no fussing and arguing and going on carrying on in the house somebody got to be humble a one go at it love them just pray are you with me children get all upset just pray God will change them once you done told them and told them and told them just pray for them thank God to touch it hard God changes the heart so by the grace of God if you got enemies and you think they're your enemy just keep praying because God is using them to perfect you to bring you closer to God see whether or not you can still be humble still lovable in spite of you heard that tonight let's take heed
