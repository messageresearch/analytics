[28:05] good afternoon
[28:14] i wrote down a few things because i
[28:16] could be here all day talking about miss
[28:17] murray
[28:19] so let me preface by good afternoon
[28:21] family and friends
[28:22] my sincerest condolences and prayers at
[28:25] this time of
[28:26] bereavement caring loyal beautiful
[28:30] god-fearing humble faithful
[28:34] altruistic are just a few attributes
[28:36] that come to mind when i think of miss
[28:38] murray
[28:39] the old adage people come into our lives
[28:42] for a season
[28:44] a reason and a lifetime
[28:51] i met miss murray seven years ago at
[28:53] hopkins middle school
[28:55] i knew there was a reason and we will be
[28:57] in each other's lives for a lifetime
[29:00] miss murray always gave more than she
[29:02] took
[29:04] she was the kind of person who always
[29:06] wanted you to be all right
[29:08] whether it was feeding you clothing you
[29:10] providing you with comfort in your time
[29:12] of need
[29:14] she not only gave us her time she gave
[29:16] us her talent and her love
[29:18] and i gave her her flowers when she was
[29:20] here
[29:21] we ate lunch every day at work together
[29:24] when we had a chance
[29:27] so this is the poem that i wrote for
[29:29] miss murray
[29:32] we knew little that morning when god
[29:34] called your name
[29:36] and life we loved you dearly and death
[29:39] we will do the same our hearts broke
[29:42] when we lost you you did not go alone
[29:45] for part of us went with you
[29:48] the day god called you home you left us
[29:51] with beautiful memories
[29:53] your love is still our god and though we
[29:55] cannot see you
[29:57] i know you'll always be by my side our
[30:00] friendship chain is broken
[30:02] and nothing seems the same
[30:07] but as god calls us one by one i know
[30:10] our chain
[30:10] will link again
[30:28] good morning um i too had to write down
[30:31] my
[30:31] my thoughts and my feelings so that i
[30:33] could keep my emotions in check
[30:37] but beverly owens murray was a loving
[30:40] daughter
[30:41] a gracious sister a devoted wife an
[30:44] auntie
[30:45] a friend a godmother and my mom
[30:49] she was a nana to my children
[30:52] blood couldn't have made us any closer
[30:54] and any thicker and you couldn't have
[30:56] told her i wasn't her child
[30:58] or that my children weren't her grands
[31:03] she was a second mother figure to so
[31:04] many children that she assisted on a
[31:06] daily basis
[31:07] she had a heart like no other and
[31:09] oftentimes caring for others and putting
[31:11] them before herself
[31:13] even when she wasn't okay
[31:16] our beverly was a blessing to everybody
[31:20] she was encouraging to so many of us and
[31:22] she was a vessel to the young people
[31:24] that she interacted with
[31:25] she taught them she encouraged them she
[31:28] loved them and spread the word of god
[31:30] and loved wherever she went she was
[31:32] always energetic and was full of life
[31:35] her spirit was very contagious she was
[31:37] righteous in her ways
[31:39] she was loving to her family and friends
[31:42] beverly yearned to be with the lord
[31:44] and she's now in his loving arms and
[31:45] protection
[31:47] on behalf of the owens murray family we
[31:49] thank you for your kind words
[31:50] thoughts and prayers during this time i
[31:53] just ask that you keep us covered in
[31:54] strength
[31:55] and lifted in prayer in the days to come
[31:58] we love you all
[31:59] our favorite scripture that we both
[32:02] loved so much that i have it permanently
[32:05] on me
[32:07] the lord is the light in our salvation
[32:10] for whom shall
[32:10] we fear the lord is the strength of our
[32:13] life
[32:14] and whom shall we be afraid just keep us
[32:16] covered in strength and prayers at this
[32:19] [Applause]

[32:37] here and say anything but sister bowie
[32:38] and
[32:39] sister beverly were real close and they
[32:42] talked all the time

[32:50] and she said she was ready she told
[32:54] sister bowie is i call her grandma she's
[32:56] my mother-in-law i just call her grandma

[32:59] she said that uh sister beverly said i'm
[33:01] ready
[33:02] and uh praise the lord he took her that
[33:05] day
[33:06] but she put some things down on
[33:09] her relationship and i told her i'd read
[33:11] it for a man
[33:12] amen
[33:16] to me she was one of the best friends
[33:18] anyone could have
[33:20] no matter when you saw her she's always
[33:23] the same
[33:26] i never seen her upset nor angry
[33:30] one of her favorite sayings was girl
[33:34] i tell you and then like grandma said
[33:38] she'd kick her head back and start talk
[33:40] talk
[33:40] talk talk then she started talking and
[33:43] talking
[33:44] and talking the good thing about it is
[33:47] she always talking about the lord
[33:50] how good he is all the miracles that he
[33:53] did
[33:53] in her life and how he brought her out
[33:56] of the world
[33:57] and how the lord blessed her and her
[34:00] husband
[34:01] and how the lord put them together and
[34:04] she just
[34:05] loved cooking for brother gerald
[34:09] brother got spoiled sister beverly was a
[34:12] sister
[34:13] of all traits there was nothing she
[34:16] couldn't do
[34:17] she did her best to help me
[34:20] and my granddaughter to learn how to sew
[34:23] she helped
[34:24] us with cooking and one of the best
[34:27] things she loved the most was singing
[34:29] for the lord
[34:30] she would give her all all to the lord
[34:33] from her heart
[34:35] there's nothing that she wouldn't do for
[34:37] you she just loved doing for people
[34:40] taking care of ones that were sick and
[34:42] needy sister beverly on the day that the
[34:44] lord came
[34:45] and took her home we talked about how
[34:48] she was saying that it was no it didn't
[34:50] matter
[34:51] when the lord came for you you got to be
[34:53] ready

[34:59] there is so much i could say
[35:02] i lost one of my best friends in the
[35:04] lord amen

[35:09] beverly was always smiling
[35:11] if you saw sister beverly her
[35:14] countenance was always
[35:15] uplifting she was sincere
[35:19] she was giving every time she came by
[35:22] the house or
[35:23] every time grandma would come she'd
[35:25] always bring bringing something to the
[35:26] house
[35:27] i said praise the lord she was a given
[35:29] sister
[35:30] and she could sing even after she was
[35:34] bedridden for i don't know how long and
[35:35] then she came to the fellowship here
[35:38] and she gave her testimony and then
[35:40] brother simmons put her on the spot
[35:41] asked her to sing
[35:42] we didn't know if she had strength or
[35:44] not but the lord blessed that sister
[35:46] with a gift she could sing
[35:47] and she sang from her heart she was
[35:50] blessed

[42:59] for
[43:03] what we leave behind the testimonies
[43:07] the things that god has done it'll keep
[43:10] on living
[43:13] so we want to say
[43:17] a few things i've heard so many
[43:20] wonderful things about
[43:21] sister beverly and and hearing those
[43:25] things uh
[43:26] i began to re reflect back
[43:30] a few years ago
[43:34] she had an operation and
[43:38] the doctors did all they could do and
[43:40] she was diagnosed with terminal
[43:44] and during that time and eugeno
[43:48] was going through her troubled times and
[43:51] gina had went completely blind
[43:55] and they diagnosed her with
[43:59] she'd probably never see again if she
[44:01] did she would just only see it just so
[44:03] slightly
[44:06] and god
[44:09] miraculously healed her and
[44:12] she was able to drive again
[44:17] and so she was so happy that
[44:20] god had healed her but not knowing that
[44:24] she was going to have some trouble times
[44:27] now mind you
[44:28] beverly probably didn't even tell
[44:31] eugene what she was going to
[44:36] and it was many times
[44:40] she was taking care of eugene
[44:44] and she was already diagnosed terminal
[44:49] and cheaper didn't have much time
[44:53] but god blessed her to go and i'm
[44:56] talking about
[44:58] tireless time day and night
[45:01] taking care of eugene
[45:05] and
[45:08] she worked hard she loved her sister she
[45:11] loved her family
[45:14] a lot of times we were there with her
[45:18] sometimes just about every day with the
[45:20] eugenia
[45:22] my wife would stay on the phone
[45:26] sometimes off and on all night and we
[45:29] knew what badly
[45:30] i had to go through but nobody knew
[45:35] i thought some of the family knew they
[45:37] said no she didn't let them know
[45:40] and i didn't you know to beverly
[45:44] she was healed i'm here
[45:50] nevertheless she told us the diagnosis
[45:53] and she accessed it
[45:55] continually praying because she was
[45:58] healed
[46:01] and by the grace of god she did not
[46:05] any different she said she was healed
[46:09] she acted like she was healed
[46:12] so she went back to work
[46:18] and she took
[46:22] what the doctor said she saw my heels
[46:25] they wanted to do disability she says
[46:28] i'm healed so
[46:32] it it took her so long before she just
[46:34] say well
[46:35] i just do the disability thing
[46:39] but by the grace of god it took
[46:43] something out of her just to
[46:48] say okay this is what they want me to do
[46:51] but if it's up to beverly no matter how
[46:54] what she was going through
[46:57] she was going to stick to the word he
[47:00] was wounded father transgressions
[47:03] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[47:05] chastisement of our peace was
[47:07] upon him and with his stripes we are
[47:11] healed
[47:12] [Applause]
[47:15] so she kept that testimony
[47:19] that i'm healed amen she didn't want to
[47:22] confess
[47:24] what they say she want to confess what
[47:27] the words say
[47:28] i'm healed so by the grace of god
[47:33] um she
[47:37] i was there praying for her grandmom and
[47:40] she was taking care of grandma
[47:43] and that was a tireless time she was
[47:46] just all the way to the end and
[47:50] we would come by and we would pray with
[47:52] grandmom and
[47:54] and beverly would be there taking care
[47:56] of her not knowing it
[47:57] after she got through taking care of
[47:59] grandma it's time for her to take care
[48:02] of eugene
[48:04] and then it comes to her
[48:08] but i thank god for the saints and every
[48:12] one of you that
[48:14] sister boy that took time out of her
[48:17] schedule to
[48:18] come and stay with her
[48:22] deadly and to to she could just get back
[48:27] enough strength to
[48:31] move and do what she needs to do at the
[48:34] house and
[48:35] the different ones sister keisha
[48:38] lee sometimes they don't want me to say
[48:42] but

[48:45] very much proud of the saints that
[48:48] that was there my wife that was
[48:52] able to be there all the way until the
[48:54] end

[53:18] i finish my course
[53:25] i was called early this morning
[53:29] and they was telling me
[53:33] that one of
[53:37] the members of the church i pastored in
[53:43] mullins the grandmama talked to her this
[53:45] morning
[53:46] and she said my 18 year old

[53:58] she says it's hard
[54:02] i says i know it
[54:07] we prayed with her and
[54:11] i thought about the daughter and what
[54:13] she was going through

[54:34] happen
[54:36] tomorrow
[54:40] life here it's like a vapor
[54:44] we're here today and we're going
[54:46] tomorrow
[54:49] job styles a man that is born of a woman
[54:53] but a few days and full of trouble
[54:59] life is short
[55:05] somebody said i got a raise to run
[55:09] oh god children got a restaurant
[55:14] i've seen many start running
[55:18] some ran so hard
[55:25] till they didn't last a year
[55:31] they gave out they gave in
[55:36] but there's a finishing line
[55:40] paul was looking at his destiny
[55:45] and a prophet by the name of ajumbo
[55:49] agabus
[55:52] he saw in a vision and
[55:56] he came to tell paul his destiny
[56:00] and he was telling the striving what was
[56:03] going to
[56:04] befall paul and he said
[56:08] save that the holy ghost is witness
[56:12] in every city saying that bonds and
[56:16] afflictions
[56:17] abide
[56:22] paul was looking to a place that
[56:26] it wasn't good news but to paul he
[56:30] looked at it and
[56:31] he stared his destiny in the face
[56:35] and he said none of these things
[56:38] move me
[56:43] neither can i my life dear to myself
[56:48] so that i might finish my course
[56:56] paul knew he had a course to finish
[57:01] but he said in timothy as he looked at
[57:04] the young man and he was getting ready
[57:06] to
[57:07] go off the scene he he told timothy he
[57:10] said
[57:13] the time of my departure is at hand
[57:16] and he said i'm ready to be offered up
[57:22] in other words he was saying farewell
[57:26] i'm getting ready to go
[57:30] i believe that such a bevel in her own
[57:33] way was saying farewell
[57:36] the time of my departure is at hand she
