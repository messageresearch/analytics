morning in jesus name amen as we stand this morning hebrews 11 and 1 hebrews 11 and one hallelujah you know running a little bit of track you put the fastest person at the first leg and the fast the neck the fastest person at the last leg so you put your best at the beginning and the best at the end because if there's any lost ground you can pick it up with the last lap this is our last lap brother sister we are the finishing line this is the last it says here now faith is the substance of things hoped for it is evidence of things not seen for by it the elders attain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of the things which do appear by faith abra offered a more to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain and by which he attained witness that he was righteous god testified of his gift and by it he been yet dead yet spake by faith enoch was translated that he should not see them and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god may god bless the reader of the word you may be seated we want to talk this morning because it's very prevalent we should be anticipating something that happened and something spectacular so much and so in the days of jesus christ when he came in the flesh as emmanuel which was god being interpreted god with us there was a manifestation of the uh uh it was an anticipation that the messiah would come even the woman at the well which was uh you know samaritan she said we know that when the messiah come he'll do these things they were in they knew the season and the time that they were living in and uh the season and the time the bible says no man know the day that our but he said the season and time we know amen so we're talking about rapturing faith now let's go to thessalonians 5 and he said but the time and the season brethren uh you have first thessalonians five and one but the times in the season brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourself what yourself know what perfectly first thessalonians 5 and 2 for yourselves know what perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a what thief in the night we know that judgment is striking the earth right now through the hurricanes to the earthquake all the different turmoils that are happening through the covet and all we know the judgment in the day of the lord is right at hand the manifestation of sodom and gomorrah amen is getting the word the the the world is getting into fire condition burning condition because he said as it was in the days of noah and as it was in the days of sodom thus shall it be in the day when the son of man so it's a son of man ministry hidden there amen it's it's a son of man ministry but it's going to be like the days of noah and the days of lot amen for the son of man to be revealed isn't that right so uh as luke 17 30 and so forth uh let's look at where we're at the signs of the time and we'll be able to amen if we can discern the face of the sky and say it's far weather how can we can he jesus said how can we not discern the signs of the time we know that the signs are here and it's telling us what time it is it's time for the judgment it's time amen that god's going to judge this world amen now the world has to get inside on the condition to fulfill amen the son of man ministry must be must come at the same time because he said he said as it was in the days of knowing as it was the days of the lord thus shall be in the day when the son of man shall be revealed isn't that right so we're wondering why all these things are happening like it's happening amen they have to happen this way they meant to get you in rapture and condition amen you amen ought to be elevated and raised up and in anticipation that we are in amen this uh cycle of time and we're in amen this particular amend cycle that we should be anticipating amen the coming of the lord and believe me brother when i say wrapped in faith we know it's just not mechanics but it has to be mechanics and dynamics amen it's not just a letter but it might it have to be the spirit to quicken the word and bring the word to life amen so we have to have something that come forth from the lord to bring us into rapture and condition amen and so amen the purpose of amen might account for was to bring the bride in rapture to condition amen to bring us back to the faith that was once delivered unto the apostolic fathers amen god will restore the years that they can't go on the prominent one locals in the caterpillar eaten god said i will restore amen and then hosea said after two days he will revive us amen god has given and revived us amen but we must come amen to fool amen a revelation amen that we might become in full manifestation of what god promised the bride and the church would be in this hour amen amen if there was an elijah then as i was talking to brother gavin this morning from england they said if there was an elijah then there must be an elisha amen with the double potion somewhere it meant because amen and if that devil potion is available amen then we ought to be in that condition that we can take the same manner and we can go back and smoke jordan amen don't just talk about elijah ministry amen but because elisha had amen his ministry amen that he was the continuation amen of elijah's ministry so we're to continue what christ was doing amen so brother and sister we must understand that we too are expected amen to prophesied again and that there'll be a real manifestation of the power of god in our lives are you with me because if we are not expecting nothing we won't get anything amen we understand by faith enoch was what translated amen and faith come by what here so there must be a word amen and hearing by the word of god so there must be a word that come forth from the lord that would give rapture in faith amen and that was the purpose of the word for the hour to give rapture and faith amen and see when we got it we don't have to talk about it but there must be a manifestation amen praise god you don't have to amen uh i'll say a virgin shall concede and quote the scripture for mary was the manifestation of isaiah 7 14. amen she wasn't repeating and quoting amen isaiah 7 14 she was manifesting isaiah 7 14 a virgin shall concede that had happened to her and she was impregnated with the word and she was bringing forth a messiah in that day jesus christ the son of god are you a man so you and i amen we don't have to talk about what god is going to do amen i i i i wrote down something while i was praying amen jesus christ and i thought i uh speak on jesus christ the same yesterday today and i wanted to talk about today amen jesus christ today that's hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday and today and forever but i want to talk about today is he the same today and if he is the same today amen then amen what he did then he would be doing now in our lives and if he's not doing that we ought to be crying not to god you promised lord yeah amen we are the promised word for the hour but if we are the promised word for the hour then where's the manifestation amen and where is the god of elijah amen praise god then somebody ought to testify the god of elijah is with elisha amen somebody ought to recognize that the god they met praise god of molecular for amen is wealth amen the hearts being turned back to the faith of the apostolic father and they're producing the same works they meant the works that i do jesus said shall you do also and greater works in these shall he do because i go to my father and if the greater works are working themselves out to you then somebody ought to recognize amen these men are eagerly learned but they've been with jesus amen you got to amen have a real relationship they meant that you got to have in real revelation to bring forth manifestation brother and sister there got to be something that give us rapture in faith amen not just sitting around amen and reminiscing and and thinking that all is well but we got to have the real power in our lives it's got to be a real genuine stir amen there's got to be something that's quicker than us amen calling us ain't meant to meet the challenge of the hour amen and we're being challenged today amen with this covet and everything else that's coming on the earth we're being challenged today and and as amen we got to go out and meet the goliath of the hour we got to go out and meet the challenges of the day we got to go and smite y'all and like elisha did are you with me so jordan won't stand in our way amen we can pardon jordan amen so brother and sister it's not something that we're just preaching about and getting excited because somebody's saying that amen but there must be a manifestation and a demonstration of the power of god in our lives and we must seek god's face and we must pray until something happened to change our very amen attitude about the word amen because the right mental attitude about the word will bring him on the scene amen and it'll bring forth manifestation amen you'll see amen not just mechanics but you'll see dynamics amen so brother and sister don't let me get too excited let me calm down a minute amen but i hope something that would sink in so i don't want to just preach to you i want to talk to you today amen that something might shrink down in your spirit and in your soul something that would grab a hold that caused an urgency about amen the word of god so there must be faith for healing amen uh so uh sometimes we preach about divine healing with the stripes we are healed but we got to uh amen uh uh the purpose amen uh of of all the silence in heaven you know and the purpose of the seven seals amen they said seven thunders out of their voices and i was about to write amen praise god he said to john seal up the sand with the seven thunders other than write them not but in the days of the voice of the seven angel when he shall begin to sound then the mysteries of god shall be finished amen what was the thunder's other not the mysteries amen we believe that it's the coming of the lord isn't that right and it is the coming of the lord there must be surgeon of the holy ghost to search us with an anointing amen praise god the word that brings the people into rapture and faith amen so god must amen he's given an anointing an outpouring of the holy ghost a surge amen a double portion of his spirit amen to bring us oh god into rapture and faith amen what is it amen and we can't say amen we can't say hallelujah we can't say thank you jesus why because the revelation is not striking deep enough amid the urgency of the time we just amen we sit still as though he's talking about somebody else but he said that's me oh lord amen praise god as the little boy saw himself in the mirror and he recognized that's me amen and you must see yourself in the mirror of the word and recognize that's you amen god was speaking of you amen and i see amen myself in the word amen and that the real word manifestation amen a bride coming of the lord jesus christ amen and she amen it's coming into her perfection amen because amen perfection comes amen through the word and christ said be perfect amen there must be a perfect oh bride amen praise god what makes you perfect it's what the blood of jesus christ did for us and we must read amen praise god point it to calvary amen and we must get that surge amen to look younger to calvary and what cavalry has afforded us it brought perfection back to us are you with me hallelujah it's a blood covenant it's between you and i brother and sister we got to take advantage of what he did amen and coverage to bring perfection to bring the bride back in order amen stay in step brother it says here it says okay okay it says for yourselves know preferably that the day of the lord does come as a thief in the night it says in the third verse of first thessalonians 5 for when they shall say what peace and safety residency even in america we want peace and safety amen in our communities in our homes everywhere amen we got security systems because it seems as though there's no peace and no safety nobody feels safe anymore amen there's a paranoid about everybody you're looking around and looking behind you amen because peace and safety folks are turning on one another they meant they if they can destroy you in the name of uh of defending themselves because they uh you know it's something that we're living in a world it meant that people will think they're doing god a service even by condemning the prophet and all kind of stuff that they're doing amen instead of going on and trying to get a sinner to christ amen trying to get somebody for the baptism of the holy ghost trying to get somebody that's crippled they meant to walk again somebody that's blind to see again somebody that need help amen was terrible amen they're beating the amen on somebody that passed away over 50 years ago amen god help us amen help us to realize that we're in a time of rapture faith we need to hear something from the lord that would anchor us anchor our soul we need something amen that calls us amen to get a surge of the anointing of god in our lives amen we don't need to be caught up with the world and all its foolishness and craziness amen we need to get a hold of god in a real way and said god we need you now i need you in my life lord i amen i see what i need i need more of you lord i need your power i know i ain't man what i supposed to do and what i supposed to bring forth and i don't see it being manifested in my life god i want to see it manifested i want to walk him and lock in and walk off amen i want translation faith lord i want rapture in grace lord god me i have it lord i gotta have it lord i gotta have it i can't go to amen just be a church school or a message believer amen i need god in my life amen i i just can't just walk around with mechanics i need dynamics amen you got to know that you need more amen you got you need more praise god i want to walk like in and walk praise god i how many didn't want to end up walk amen in the walk came and praise god i want to walk like anything amen see some some folks amen walk amen and they don't they don't they don't know where they're walking amen they're walking after the flesh they're not walking in the spirit but we need to walk in the spirit amen but a lot of folks are walking after the flesh god i want to walk in the spirit and if you walk in the spirit you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen praise god he said for there is there now no condemnation to them that are what in christ jesus amen when you're in christ jesus you don't have to worry about this old flesh holding you down because as long as you stay in christ amen if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you can act what you will and i'll do it amen i'm saying brother and sister it's time to abide under the shadows of the almighty amen i want you to stay there amen to god do something for you stay there until the amen till you know that the blood has been applied stay there until you know you got the baptism of the holy ghost stay on your knees stay crying out god i got to get desperate there got to be a rapture lord i don't want to miss it in my life i want to be a part amen of that rapture amen god i know i am a part amen because you ain't bored me out amen you didn't bring me out not to take me in in that time and as many came out of egypt but then many didn't go into the promised land but lord i want to be one in a million uh i want to go all the way lord i just don't want to come out and mama and crumble and complain but i want to be one that said yes lord we're more than evil to take the land i'm more than evil amen to have what you say i got it amen praise god they might not amen have crossed over into they met their inheritance but they were in a battle in the wilderness got so many that was holding them back to unbelief there was so much unbelief in the camp that god said they cannot aim it get the promised land there's so many folks amen that are saying all kinds of stuff amen that's holding you back amen from your promises ain't meant for god to fulfill the promises in your life amen is so much amen your minds are being contaminated amen your spirit amen is being contaminated but i want you to know heaven therefore these promises did it be love let us cleanse ourselves from the all the uh amen every thing that's of the flesh in the spirit that we might perfect holiness in the fear of god i want to clean my aim to cleanse ourselves amen let's let god wash us in the water of the word let's get a good clean and uh amen let's get some baptism at the baptism of holy ghost fire let it burn in our soul let something happen ain't meant to oh god to move away all our doubts move away all our fears cause faith to rise up amen i'm not gonna let these things hold me down amen i'm gonna burn up with wings as an eagle and i'm gonna fly to the expectation amen that god said the bride would be i'mma fly above all these chaotic things that are happening in the earth today god has called me to a heart calling and i'm going to aim at the press towards the mall or the prize of the what i'm pressing into my perfection amen i'm pressing into perfection amen oh god it's a perfected word it's a word that god has placed in the hand amen of you and i that we can be able amen to walk into our theophany walk out of here and walk into our changed body amen the word rapture is not there but he said i'll be caught up to meet him amen hallelujah the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout brother and sister i believe god has shouted out a word in this hour and that word is said come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sin are you with me they meant the voice of god amen has shouted out come out and we've come out amen shout amen he has descended in a shout amen with a word from god amen praise god call the bride amen out from amen the systems of man-made religion calling us back amen to the word amen because that would be amen praise god there must be a time amen that we have the feasts of tabernacle amen calling us back to the feast of atonement calling us back to recognize calvary in reality form amen the amen that the emphasis might put be put back amen on the cross of jesus christ and that we get the full effects for what he died for amen come on somebody they met the faith to come back to the cross come back to where amen what the cross has done for you and i he amen he made us new creatures to restore us back amen what did calvary do for them what did the blood do for them amen to call their shoes not to wear out that was the blood of an animal amen none of them was sick of fever amen no sickness among them amen praise god because they came out under the blood of a lamb amen but we come out under the blood of the lamb of god amen jesus christ amen and amen praise god god took them through amen 40 years amen it wasn't a fever person among them amen i want you to know god is bringing us into that same anointing of the lamb of god the blood never shed that gives rapture faith amen we'll walk in our healing we'll walk in our victory we'll walk under the blood of jesus realizing that we can get the full effect of what he died for amen i'm telling you brother and sister we must say men have faith to get the full effect amen everything that the blood amen he died for we must possess it are you with me hallelujah we cannot doubt anything praise god hallelujah walking in the fullness amen of what god promised you and i am they had to take their natural land and they had to cross over jordan into their natural land we got to cross over our joining and die out to ourselves and go and possess the land that god has given to us and they meant by the promised word of the hour amen i've given you the land amen you must amen possess it amen hallelujah oh i believe the early church had a revelation of possession i believe they walked a minute i got i got to try to get where i was going amen but brothers and sisters time is winding up but let me try to read this he says the third verse says when nation said peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them and travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but you brethren are not in what not in darkness that that they should overtake you as a way ye are the children of the light and not and the children of the day we are not of the night nor our darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and what and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken or drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breath plate of what faith and what faith and love and for in heaven the hope of salvation amen let's put it on brother faith and love faith and love what is faith it's at the bottom love is at the top amen let's put on faith and love amen let the afro and omega come together they make the beginning in the end and the first and the last let's come together amen praise god jesus said i'm the alpha and omega i am the beginning and i'm the end i'm jesus your perfection is in christ as i said the other day that he might present every man perfect in christ amen we must have perfect faith for rapture amen and perfection amen come by the word amen he sent his word and it healed them amen and so god gives you and then the word to perfect you amen to bring you into oneness with him father make them one even as we are one amen amen what did i do i've given them thy word amen the word amen made them one with christ and they amen receive the word make them want even as we are one amen we're talking about moving into rapture and faith we're talking about getting out of here we're talking about the changing of the body we're talking about oh hallelujah brother don't let nothing stop you you'll change about the changing of your body amen don't let nothing hold you back from the changing of your body amen don't let amen all the chaos and confusion who's going to be the next president amen don't let that stop you don't get caught up in that change praise god but let us see who amen where god is leading us amen if you then be rhythm with christ seek those things which are above amen praise god i'm seeking the things that above amen i i i got to look to him amen praise god man i'm looking for the coming of the lord i'm looking for him to appear then he shall appeal we shall be like him i believe he's appeared in this last day in the revelation and revealing of the son of man in his word praise god christ is revealing his own word oh you the word is oh lord i got to go on what hopefully by the grace of god slow it down i know i'm going like a machine gun but i gotta slow down are y'all with me amen rapture faith amen i wanna be raptured but i gotta have faith not just something that i'm caught up in some type of camp but i'm caught up in the word and i'm anticipating what god said and it's anointing his spirit what caused that to happen amen so brother and sister it says in the fifth verse of hebrews it says by faith in it was translated that he should not s shall not see death amen brother and sister he didn't even see death death couldn't take him because he had enough faith that he should not see there amen brother and sister we ought to look to the rapture not to death come on if some of us go go before but we should not see death because we can't die we cannot die we're telling the truth because we pass from death to life are you with me the only thing we can do is change amen pull off this mortal into my immortality but as far as dying we can't die we can sleep but in the morning he'll call and i answer but we won't die we'll just sleep for a moment sleep over there in the sixth dimension waiting on the seventh dimension where we can go up there we're here to the marriage supper the lamb are you with me god put us to sleep whatever he put us over there in the sublime beyond the curtains of time amen praise god going over into the likeness of a paradise waiting on amen the rest of the slangs those that sleep in christ amen so brother and sister let me show you for a moment uh first thessalonians 4 he says the 13th verse it says i keep my hand on on hebrews but but i will not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are what asleep so the saints like brother derry are asleep they're not dead they're sleeping brother and sister amen that you sorry not even as others that have no what amen praise god brothers and sisters something about having hope we can't die we got hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep in jesus will god bring with him amen praise god for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the what coming of the lord shall not what amen you're not going to hinder them that sleep amen for the lord himself shall what descend from heaven with a shout and that's what the message of the hour was all about a shout the lord himself not a man but the lord himself shall descend with the child praise god when the minister meet preaching the gospel and teaching the gospel it should not be the man it should be god but a lot of times people they see the veil and they think they see moses but he said the lord said i'm going to deliver them out and god was the deliverer not moses but god was using moses body but it was god that's doing the work god want to use you amen to show translation power in this hour are you with me god want to use you to be a manifestation of what the rapture is all about and as much as he's bought you with the shop the rapture has begun in you because he's raptures us out of dead creeds and dogmas and denominational system and he raptures us out to be identified with him are you with me so you're no longer dead you've been quickened by the spirit you've been called out what was it the lord himself said come out of here my people are you with me so there has been a a rapture or catching up god had caught you up call you out amen because you have been identified with the rapture you are the resurrection amen and the resurrection has begun to take place in you amen so the change has already begun praise god you are a manifestation of those that have walked out and now you and you're in you're taking the steps of ending you're walking with god where you where you going i'm going into my translation are you with me amen you keep walking with god and what happened you have a body change amen and it kept walking until he was not are you with me you're going to walk till you're not amen god bless you this morning do you love him he says for this we say by the word of the lord that we which alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them to sleep 16 verse for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and what the what trump of god and the dead in christ shall what so don't worry about them they're going to get up first and somebody said when jesus rose from the dead and matthew said the dead folks are the saints jesus was the first fruit of the resurrection he got up and the saints that were asleep in the old testament got up and they walked around jerusalem amen but he he didn't go back i mean he walked around and it was about 40 days before he sent back the holy
