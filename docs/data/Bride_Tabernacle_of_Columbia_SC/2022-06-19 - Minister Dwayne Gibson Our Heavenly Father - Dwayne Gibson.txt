jesus christ's name malachi the second chapter and we're going to read the 10th verse and i read the 10th version may be seated have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we uh then deal treacherously one every man against his brother by fulfilling the covenant of our fathers amen praise god you may be seated amen praise god don't forget i'm trying to look for a scripture i had it written down and it ain't to the right place but that scripture was good too amen praise god all of a work together for the good amen praise the lord amen praise god praise the lord amen praise god malachi 1 6. as the father honors his son as the son honored his father and his servant his master if i they then i be a father where is my honor and if i be a master where's my fear saith the lord of hosts unto you o priest that despised my name and he said when have we despised science and we're going to talk about our heavenly father this morning our heavenly father we thank god for father's day this is what the world called father's day nothing against that but we understand a lot of responsibility going with that term called father you know we are you know children are born and we have responsibility as parents and especially the fathers to be a provider a man to to be a protector and many other things there's a lot of responsibility that goes with that term father and we know that everybody is not worthy of that term though everybody get the praise for it we know they're not worthy of it because they don't take care of the responsibility so it's a good great responsibility to be not something light to say i got a child i got a daughter i got a son well that's good but are you doing the responsibility to come along with that see there's a responsibility that we must measure opportunity we know a lot of times we fall short many young men fall short in this day they far of their responsibility they don't do what they're supposed to do yet on this day called father and everybody happy and things like that and but when you come down and look at the responsibility are you taking care of the responsibility that was god looking at so god being our father our heavenly father he take care of his responsibility he never failed us as a father now we have to understand that he is our father god is your heavenly father so we give thanks to the natural side but what about the spiritual side we are to wake up giving thanks to our heavenly father every day amen he's our heavenly father and he has never failed as he had never failed to his responsibility to as a father i think he had never referred his responsibility he's always been there as a provider as a protector to keep us amen why because he is our heavenly father amen praise god so we want to give everything to him today he said if i'm a father then where's mine on see we lack giving him the honor we want to give honor to one another not wrong with that now especially if you're living up to your responsibility if you're a father this morning and you're living up to your responsibility as a father then god bless you but if you're a father this morning you got children in this world that god have allowed you to have and you're not living up to your responsibility then you need to do better i believe every young man every person that got children in this world you're not living up to your responsibility as a father then you need to do better god is our example how to be a father to take care of what the lord has given us our children the bible that the inheritors of the lord that's right your children is inheritance of the lord so you ought to take care of that which god has entrusted you with come on somebody i said god has entrusted you with something a responsibility it's a blessing that god have allowed you that us to have children to have children are the children should be a blessing not a curse that's right don't let your children be a curse see you let them be a blessing to you man you say what ain't doing right that's all right it's still going to be a blessing to you what you got to do you got to pray for him didn't god our father pray for us is god praying for us amen that we might come out right pray for your children that god will bless them to do what come out right you know what you're looking for in this world your your your birthing and your raising your feeding you do everything you can for them and a lot of times they don't come out right but you know what there's not no reason not to continue to pray for him there's not no reason to continue to believe that god can touch him it's a responsibility and once god gives you that responsibility you never let go of that responsibility you always going to be a father to that child no matter what that how old hallelujah god is always going to be our father even when we go on screen sometimes he never oh my god shucker's responsibility even when adam and eve went to screen the garden of eden i said god their father was right there for him i say he was he went there and dude it was in the wrong he he went there provided away form amen a lot of time and you know being a father you come that time and place of correction a lot of times we don't want to bring that correction like a shirt but thank god our heavenly father he is not afraid to give us correction i think god isn't afraid the bible whom the lord love you does what he chase him see he's not afraid to bring correction because he know correction is what gonna keep us straight correction of what keeps the child in the right path being a son or daughter you don't correct your child the bible says it will go astray and even under correction sometimes they're still going straight but you as a parent as a father you must pray for them oh my god god prayed for us in the form of his son the lord jesus christ coming down may manifest in the flesh he's i prayed for thee that thy faith faithful or not amen so all that the father had given him he prayed for us that we wouldn't go astray so our heavenly father we ought to give all the glory and all the honor to him today if he is your father now you gotta you gotta you have to recognize that god is your father and that don't come lightly everybody is not god or not everybody's father i'm gonna go too far ahead of myself but let's go to the gospel come to john it's sad to say but god is not everybody's father thank god he's your father this morning if you have accepted him you have to be born into this family you can't come join the family you can't just come around the family you got to be born into the family of god and that's how you become children of god by being born into the family see you must be born again that's what jesus told nicodemus he came seeking jesus by night jesus told nicodems he must be born again that's right so it's a birth that must take place inside our lives for god to recognize the will of his father you were born into this world naturally by a mom and a dad and that you recognize that that that person whoever that is to be your parent that's right you're born again spiritually so now you must recognize that god is your father so you recognize who your father is jesus said in one place called no man on earth your father to those that have been born again see you don't have no more a father god is our father now he he he he take cares of us hallelujah we can't do it all we recognize that we need our heavenly father's help we recognize that without him we can't do nothing we recognize we need our heavenly father we need them this morning how many y'all need them this morning you need him now you need your father to be there for you that child is dependent on you don't you know your children depending on you your child is dependent on you as a father he looked at that mother looked at that father so they depended on you and this is a natural child depends on his parents we this morning as god's children we are dependent on our heavenly father to keep all his promises come on somebody to give you every problem we were dependent on him to do it and we want him to do it so we're dependent on him you know and god knew we're dependent on him he recognizes that he may he know we are dependent on him this morning as our father amen praise god god is a good father amen he's the best father you ever have when your mama and daddy forsake you the bible said then who will take you up the lord shall take you up when your natural parents don't do what they're supposed to do we got a heavenly father to do everything he needs to do because he promised he'll do it hallelujah sometime our parents don't do right but god said he won't forsake us he said he's our heavenly father i thank god he's my father my father forsake me my mother forsake me god was there to take me up oh lord if i'm here this morning because god took me up i was always his child see remember that now you can't this thing can't come it hadn't been before the foundation of the world it just couldn't just happen you become a child of god you was always that before when the foundation of the world and that what brings you to the new that's where you can come into the new birth you cannot even come into the new birth if you wasn't with them from the beginning if you was not with him from the beginning you could never come into the new birth so the new breath testifies that you are god's child it testifies who you are amen if you don't never come to your new birth that means you never was a part of god from the beginning you've got to come to the new birth to be born again where into the what the kingdom of god you got to be born of this kingdom you can't join this kingdom jesus don't look at himself a man be born again a water spirit he cannot even see the kingdom of god the man be born again he cannot even enter the kingdom of god so to be a part of this kingdom this heavenly kingdom you must be what born again born from above you're going to read that you got to be born again see your first birth brings you into a natural uh place but this second birth this new birth brings you into a spiritual a fellowship awakening of who you really are amen hallelujah it brings you to an awakening of who you really are amen you're not that president of the world trying to make you you're the person that god always foreknew you to be hallelujah you're that praying that god always foreknew you to be a man always a son of god always a daughter of god always one of his amen look at the gospel calling to john amen praise the lord amen uh john the eighth chapter being a father is a hard job that was the kind of responsibility a lot of times men we run from that responsibility we don't want to do that what must be done see we must provide see that's that's that's our responsibility god when god when man got away from god and the god of eden god told man he got to work by the sweat of his brother that's right he had to go out there and provide for his family and we live in an age now that men don't want to come up to that responsibility they don't want to work lord have mercy i'm not a man their father got children don't want to work don't want to be the provider that god made them to be god made the man to be the provider that's right the sisters working on thing that's good all right but you ain't going to be the provider man is supposed to be a divider how you say yeah that striker in god provider amen the natural type the spiritual god is your you want to form i found an example of a good father that none other than god he's the example we should follow that's right he provides for us he provides everything so that man he must be the what the provider that's his what responsibility see that's his responsibility the woman's now and this is right here y'all don't be able to talk to you and if they ain't right here women want to be the provider you let that man make you the provider because you're not supposed to be the man put the beautiful body that's right it ain't a 50-50 deal either there's a hundred percent thing and then 50-50 you take this half nope it's a 100 deal doesn't god do it 100 hundred percent deal it ain't a 50-50 deal it's a hundred percent you know we're the provider god made it that way that's the way god placed it amen so we ought to come up to what our responsibility god is going to do his he you will never say god did what he's supposed to do you'll never say it man he's always doing what he's supposed to do you're always provides he always does what he said you can never say god you didn't live up to your responsibility god always keeps his word he lives up to his responsibility as a father he does exactly what he say he'll do hallelujah what he needs to do sometimes we need discipline lord he knows how to do it don't he oh lord he know how to do it you know how to do it you know the discipline i said man to bring us back to the right spot where we need to be he knows how to do it sometimes we lack that wisdom on how to discipline children but i say god knows how to discipline this morning you know how to do it to bring us right back to him and that what you want to do come back to god when we go straight sometimes get out the way get on the wrong track if you're god's child god will make sure you come back see he knows how to discipline us sometimes i say we lack that wisdom and it takes wisdom sometimes to discipline children because the bible says um fathers be not um uh are harsh or be not um bitter against your children whatever the scriptures saying that wise uh you you gotta we gotta get that wisdom see cause sometimes we can we can run them away we can run them away god don't want us to get do you think god want to run you away god don't want to run your way may god i want you to stay inside the camp that's right he wants you to stay where in the father's house he wants you to stay right there because to get out the father's house is to get in all kind of trouble amen god's going to john the uh eighth chapter amen praise the lord amen john 18 39 it's sad to say every god is not everybody's father and that's the spiritual revelation to realize that some people are not god they're not god's children they belong to somebody else they belong they belong to the enemy we're going to read here john 8 39 then jesus then answered and said unto him abraham was our father jesus said unto them if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that had told you the truth would have heard of god this did not abraham do you do the deeds of your father then say they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god they have you jesus and if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came out of myself but he sent me why do you understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word notice here you have your father who you mean your father's the devil some people father is who that's hard ain't it that's very hard they know these people fathers the devil and they they ain't gonna be saved the father's who the devil god is a father the devil got children out there too and the bible says there's two people in this world the children of light and the children of what darkness so some people's father is the devil that's what they can't stop doing wrong they can't help themselves their father is the devil that would jesus say you do the works of your fathers your father was a murderer from the beginning there was a murder they wanted to kill jesus he abolished not on the truth because he knows truth there i mean you don't speak alive because he's the father of it so these people father was up the devil they were doing the same work to the father doing if we god's children hallelujah we're just saying work so far to do man come on somebody you'll do the same works he did now i don't talk about some americans stuff like that but you live right and do right amen why you got his gene inside you you take the characteristics of who your father or your mother why they got your genes in them that's right we got god dna and how we get dog dna in us by the holy ghost amen come on somebody you got god dear in you inside you and you can't help but doing what's right until you get god's dna inside you then you can't do what's right why you have your father who the devil the devil children can't do right the devil he can't pay the devil to do right jesus i'm saying ain't gonna do right he's gonna be alive he's gonna tell your lies all day long he ain't gonna do what's right his children ain't gonna do what's right either so you can be god's child you're going to be the devil's child that's not me saying that's the did y'all read that in the bible the bible said that jesus called those religious people of that day he said you're of your father who the devil then god said king was of who the wicked one king father was who the devil from the garden of eden said i think pass on down the line from the garden of eden see god god word can't lie cain was satan's child that's why he did what he did he took the attributes of the characteristics of his daddy he killed and murdered just like his daddy did that's right so we born of god and got god's gene inside us don't you know we do the same thing we have the characteristic of our who our heavenly father you don't want to do wrong come on somebody i said you don't want to do wrong this morning it's not in you to want to do wrong why because god gene is in you see you got the only desire you got to want to do right do you fail sometimes you still don't have no desire to want to do wrong god has taken that out of you by the holy ghost because why you been what born again see that what makes it the new braille you got to get the new birth because without the new birth then that desire of the old man still living and god got to get it out of us see by the holy ghost in order for us to display his characteristics we just playing god what attributes hallelujah we're displaying god's attributes this morning now how many are just living holy and doing we serve a holy god where do you think that come from they're coming from the heavenly father that's that characteristic the attribute an attribute of god don't want to be holy i said the attribute of god don't want to be clean the attribute of god that's not your attribute your attribute wasn't like that before god save you you're not having an attribute inside you but when god saved you change your nature then you start wanting to do things that's right that's right your nature changes just as identifying that you are what a child of god god is your father hallelujah we're giving praise to our heavenly father this morning and we're thanking him for all he's doing for us hallelujah oh lord he's doing so much for we can't even count him out can't even number him he's doing so much for us amen he's good to us come on somebody i say god is good your heavenly father is good this morning didn't he wake you up then he put in your heart to come to church this morning come on somebody you could have been out there in the street you know where i'm going to church this morning thank god you're not respecting much but god's going to give you just what you need i see he going to feed you what he's going to feed his word amen praise god so everybody father god is not everybody's father that's that's sad we try to get people to christ trying to get them over to the lord but we find out that their father is not god god is not their father god they have no claim on god god got nothing no he don't know he don't have no claim on them amen it may go to the book of peter amen first peter so we talked about our heavenly father this morning you don't hear my people talking about uh heavenly father talking about the the natural father but what about our heavenly father yeah amen we need to recognize him he said if i'll be a father where be mine on them why ain't nobody giving god on them see they're getting all the praise in that round with the f there living up to their responsibility yeah he prays on me deserving you rising that child doing the best you can that god give you and you try to do everything you do you deserve some praise you deserve a pat on the back you know one of the great things you see in the world when people can look back over life and see that their children came out all right how many y'all want me on that you look back you can be proud of yourself amen you send them to school someone got degrees and so i'm doing real good in life so you can pat yourself on the back you did a good job god bless you see that's what we're looking for right god looking for the same but you know god want to look

beloved son and whom i'm what well please come on somebody he want to look down and say i'm well pleased didn't the bible the enoch please god you want to please god i will look back and say i'm well pleased he said um come on and say good and faithful servant and unto the joy of the lord i'll express you to be fearful of a few things he'll even people over many things come on in and to the joy of the loss he goes on that what we want to say see he's going to look back and look at our lives and see that what he have accomplished he'll achieve something amen he's brought us somewhere we're not the same old person we used to be we've been changed by the power of god come on somebody our lives here like it used to be we have uh hallelujah we have moved up beyond that we are going places with bibles and we are sitting together in heavenly place as well in christ jesus amen so we're going places where in god god is raising us up he got he's shooting his children to come up hey man praise god look at the frog i say first peter man first peter 1 23 let's see that hey man so we look back and want to be proud of what god has allowed us to accomplish in our children's lives when they come out good we should be say good they got good jobs they on their own they got they got their own place and they taking care of their responsibilities they ain't calling home for mom and daddy for money mama daddy i need some money no they get they ain't doing that they didn't they in a good spot got a blessing to be in a good spot how did they get there by your guidance by you god use you as a parent as a father to guide that child down the right road and that's how they turned out right god use you come on somebody go i'll use you to be a blessing to your child none that you want to be a blessing to your children isn't god a blessing to us come on somebody god wants you to come out right he don't want you to come out baby would you come out right you want to enter your path to be good he wants you to have what eternal life amen amen isn't that what this journey is all about he wants you to have eternal life so you can make sure you come out right now amen that's what it's all about not just having things in this life a nice car nice house and stuff like that all that's good but what about eternal life that's what god aimed for says eternal life not just the blessings he give us not just things he allows to have but his true goal is what eternal life remember that your heavenly father wants you to have what eternal life that was all about that's why he came and did what he did and offered to be born again to get us back to that place where we fell from where man fell from then man in the beginning had what eternal life adam can die that's right eve cannot die that's right until they ate off the tree that god told them not to eat off that's right did they eat off that tree that's until you do what you'll die so man always had eternal life we always had it that we're not just getting that we always had it and god is bringing us back to it see that's what his purpose is amen praise god peter first peter amen praise god first peter 1 and 23. senior purified your souls and obeying the truth number 22 through the spirit of the unfailing love of the brothers did you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again see not of corruptible seed but of what incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever so we got to be what born again by what kind of seed incorruptible by what the word of god being born again see that what jesus devil jesus told nicodemus she must be born again see and peter doesn't know is by this incorruptible seed which is what the word of god jesus said the seed is the what the word so the seed is the word of god and god's seed god planted that seed inside of you since when the foundation of the world [Music] a little bit of sunlight when the water and the light scratch the seed it comes to life when god sent you that water and that light of the word struck you it came to life amen you might have been covered up all kind of muck and stuff but when the when the word came you came to life see we were covered up by muck let's see you lay under that muck that don't mean it's dead it just landed dormant until the sun here that's right until the light hit it that's how we our lives were we were all mucked up by the devil look we wasn't even a child of god about how we've been living but the light came amen the word came and shone upon it amen and whatever that seed dead came to life proving that we was always god's child the devil tried to muck us up but he couldn't do it because we were blown to god god didn't lose none of his children that's right jesus all that the father has given me will come to me and those that the father has given me none shall be lost that's right save who the son of perdition none of god's children are going to be lost god need to lose none of his oh hallelujah all the fathers giving me will come to me that's right all god's children gonna come so if god is your father you don't have to have no wary of fear god gonna make sure you end up where he got you that we want you to be at you gotta have no fear about that god of all that the father has given me i have lost none god's gonna make sure you there amen hallelujah you're gonna take you off the earth a little while before you get yourself in a bunch of trouble he gonna make sure you get there man praise god amen so our heavenly father amen he's the one that's doing these things for us he's the one that got us where we are today and we don't give him enough praise for what he's doing for us sometimes we thank god for the little things we got but we fail to realize that is our heavenly father that has allowed us to have these things so god is a good father that i want to pray to you this morning god is a good father amen he has never not done what he said he's going to do amen praise god let's go to amen amen the book of romans the eighth chapter amen praise god romans 8 15 it said for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but yet receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father amen the holy spirit in you and me cries out our father it cries out to god our father the holy spirit now before you got the holy spirit you never was crying out to god the holy spirit in you causes us to do what the cried to god it recognizes where it comes from it comes from god then jesus said i come from god i'll go back to god that's right so now they recognize the way it comes from it ain't come from this earth by his spirit we cry out all before we recognize who we are by god's holy spirit amen amen go to another scripture by the grace of god let's go to the book of luke amen praise god luke 10 and 21 the holy spirit be crying out our father be crying out heavenly father lord help me father hallelujah help me father amen i need help help me father man you begin to cry out what's doing that the holy ghost the holy spirit you begin to cry out help me father because it recognizes who it is before that time you cannot recognize but now you recognize god is your father god is my heavenly father man hallelujah i can call upon him in my time of trouble in my time of need and your answer amen yes sir he'll answer yeah he'll never forsake none of his children amen praise god i likes that amen hallelujah amen praise god luke amen praise god luke 10 and 21 in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and putin has revealed them unto babes even so fathers so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me are my father and no man knows who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son you and he to whom the son will what reveal him so god jesus christ coming in the form of the holy ghost got to reveal to you who the father is that's right he'll reveal it to you where in your spirit the bounty of the spirit itself being with our spirit that we are what the children of god amen god's spirit people are asking that we are god's children god is our father amen hallelujah he's our heavenly father and he will make a way for his children he will provide for us amen so the god will take the holy ghost to reveal that to you that god is your father and once you can oh lord catch that revelation oh this is a revelation now jesus said so it don't matter except the son reveal it and then you catch that revelation that he is your father don't you know you got a whole different attitude you got a whole different outlook now of who you are amen what you can what what god can do oh hallelujah lord i call him my heavenly father every day lord have mercy amen why he's good amen so jesus said he got to be revealed to you that he's your father the son has to reveal him the holy ghost has to reveal that to you amen praise god that he who he is who he says he's your heavenly father amen praise god this guy's in most scriptures i'm getting ready to come in by the grace of god amen let's go to uh matthew 7 amen praise god amen matthew 7 amen and 11 it started um the ninth verse or what man is their view of his son axe brave would he give him a stone you know sometimes i'll try to act for some we don't want to give it to him but i'll be honest we don't want to get especially come down the money we don't want to give it to him we might get a little we might fuss a little bit say a little something but by the grace of god god put enough grace in our heart to give it to him doing it see if a man ever if a man if a son acts bread you give him a stone but you might fuss a little bit you might say i'll give you no more money didn't you have to give me some money last week we want more money for oh well you won't just fall didn't i just week no you can't have that whatever see i'm saying but god amen i'll be asking people to give him a serpent no you ain't gonna do that do you might want to give me if you think being what evil to give good gift unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father which is in heaven you have your faults in heaven give good things to them and ask him you know what you think god let you out do him you can't beat god-given god let y'all beat him you being a natural man a good good thing to your children you think god will do the same you're going to go past that how much more should your heavenly father give good things to them that ask him see god didn't let us outdo him as parents he's the best parent that ever will be the best father in the whole wide world not another like him he let y'all do him hallelujah if you can give your child god will give you his hallelujah born abundantly he's going to give him more than you're going to have an ask for either i'll pour you out a blessing you won't have what room enough to receive so god is going to let us a natural parents i'll do him as our spiritual parent he can never let us out doom if you can do good for your children god will do good for his i'm actually stopping this morning haven't the god done good for you have you done good for you hallelujah why he's a heavenly father he can make sure you got everything you need now i might not give everything you want [Music] ain't good for us now but god will give us what we have need of amen if you got need of it he's going to give it to you but i want no you don't give all i want something i want sometimes it's dangerous a child want a car they ain't mature enough to handle a car so you don't give it to them right you know they ain't mature you know they ain't mature enough to handle a car so you don't give it well i want a car my friend's got a coyote boy i ain't got no car well when you get a little more chair and i see you can handle responsibility then i might get you a car but i want a brand new one nope you got to get a hooptie [Laughter] they want a new one now but don't get them a new one might be a mistake you got the money to spend on that's up to you don't get a child new because you got you know we got we had to earn our way we didn't get all new stuff when we wanted that stuff we had to earn our way and this generation right here we give way too much without them earning and that's why they don't appreciate they want to get up they throw it away don't bother no more but we got to learn that you know god does what god does us as a father that we're going to give everything we want he gives us what we have need of [Music] don't give us everything we want you get what we have need of and that's a blessing if we got everything we wanted only god knows where to turn up at but god gives us what we have neither am i amen you might stay inside the way that's right amen so god didn't let us out to him remember god said i never seen the righteous forsaken or seed doing but begging bread no child of god i have that testimony they know the heavenly father can apply every need they have need of amen so god can never tell me to come and say i believe i trusted god and god know that's a lie god does everything he say you don't fail there in that time you're going to apply all your knees according riches and glory by christ jesus that's right so god will not let you out do him that let me get to you this morning if we have natural parents can give to our children when they ask us for something god is saying the same thing as he is our heavenly father we ask him for something he'll give it to us if it's good it's got to be a good thing now it can't be something we just want or just to have got to be something good another thing god can give you then what what's the best thing god can give us the holy ghost that's the best thing you could ever get from god is the holy ghost let's go to the book of luke 11 chapter let's see if that's right that's the best thing you can get that will god say be born again people because you got to get the holy that's the best thing you can get it's the holy ghost you get the holy ghost like the bible say that everything else will fall right and play but you got to get that first get the holy ghost that's the best thing you can get from god is the holy ghost nothing better money ain't better bridges ain't better nothing better than what the holy ghost and you ask god for it if you have need of it you need more of it god will give it to you amen hallelujah oh lord have mercy upon his anointing amen i don't care where you at you say lord what santa cruz lord once more amen the holy ghost came that's right god will give you the holy ghost he'll pour his spirit upon you amen he'll do it right brother in your car wherever you are you want to feel that anointing that that's the holy ghost god will pour it down on you he'll give good things to them to ask him why because the holy ghost is the best thing you ever get from god nothing better luke 11. amen praise the lord amen if a son has a bridge same thing like matthew but he is brought a little different and if you ask the father would give him a stone if he actually would give him a serpent or even an a we'll offer him a scorpion no you can give your child nothing to hurt him i hope not amen you know what she's not me holy spirit listen we do things sometimes and it's not intentional but we do think sometimes it does hurt our children that's right you know it's not intentionally because we want them to have everything people here those people come i want my child to have everything i had that might not be a good thing i want to have everything i didn't have when i was growing up that might don't be too good a thing so we can destroy them unintentionally you wouldn't intentionally give them a scorpion but unintentionally you're trying to do good so you give them things that really you shouldn't give them and that's what destroys them amen so if you're being evil in order to give your good gift under your children how emotional your heavenly father give what come on somebody oh you ain't reading with me okay give the holy spirit to them that what ask him and then we just read in the previous scripture he said good things luke picks it up and said give what the holy ghost same thing axis storm the same thing so good thing the good thing is what the holy ghost see god wants you to have the holy ghost more than you wanted amen because he know what the benefits of that is his benefits and getting the holy spirit amen so he wants you to have him more than you might want it so he wants you to have it that way he's the axe and he'll give it to you amen it's already a promise it's already a promise they'll be born again baptized he's our give you the gift of the what the holy ghost so don't get baptized walk away and feel like you didn't get it then now you got to ask amen i asked every day time i wanted to speak in tongues though but i believe that the holy ghost came by speaking in tongues that we believe in pentecost so after i got baptized all i want to do was speak in tongues and i ask every day lord let me speak in times lord let me speak in time lord let me speak in time one day i remember to this day i'm coming out my back though and while i stayed at in the projects and by the grace of god i started speaking in tongues i didn't know what it was it just came on me i just started speaking and i said lord i believe that was the holy ghost i asked him for i got baptized i felt different but i didn't know where the holy ghost came on me but i started asking so we get baptized acts there's already a problem but he said if you don't feel that acts he said i'll give it to you man so you we need the holy ghost and god wants us to have it more than we might want it he wants us to have it but the holy ghost got to be the main thing in our lives that we make sure we get not just coming to church that's good come to church but make sure you get to what the holy ghost but god wants us to have it amen we need it can't live without it amen praise god we need it praise god in this video in this hour right here every time we need the holy ghost is 9. we need the holy ghost we need the holy spirit say man praise god we do amen praise god we're coming on in amen praise the lord amen let's go ahead to the um to luke the 15th chapter let's get this right here y'all know the story of the prodigal son hey man what did he do what did he do he left the father's house i said that's the worst mistake you can ever do any of us to leave the father's house why you want to leave for you got everything there for you why are you going to leave the father's house to go out there into the world or go do something different whatever why would you want to leave the father's house see this young man made a bad mistake during the time he didn't look like mom but he made a bad mistake he left the father's house all because he wanted to go out there and live like you saw the rest of the people living he want to get a little stuff and his father provided form god gives us gifts how many of y'all got gifts from god amen you got to give whether you realize or not some of y'all got gifts of singing so y'all got to give some music y'all got gifts where you get them from god you gotta you got an inherent chance where you get that from from god so he gave this young man man they give me my stuff that belonged to me my inheritance and the stuff that you done blessed me with give them to me and i'm gone get my my stuff i'm gone i'm going ahead and i'm gonna experience the world lord hamlet that's so dangerous he had to learn though see but the thing is he left the father's house don't leave the father's house stay right with god oh hallelujah say rival god got your ass don't leave the father's house hallelujah don't leave the father's house they mean cause it's out there if you leave the father's house then number trouble out there stay in the father's house amen stand the word of god stand the message for the owl stay in the revelation of god's word don't leave the father's house hallelujah that young man left the father's house he thought he was doing something but really he was just messing his life up and it didn't get messed up amen because he did the wrong thing his heavenly father is it's a type it's a type you talk about he never mentioned the mother you know it's talking about who the father the father it was the focus was on the father and i believe that man everything in the power to raise that boy right he raised him right but sometimes i influence who we get around who will our child chill and be around is the influence and they want to follow that influence see so he might have got around some people that was you know doing the things that sometimes we try to hold our children back from and i'll guarantee i believe the father's doing everything to hold his child back from there because he didn't want to go out in the world and mess his life up but that influence of other people caused him to want to go out there so he got his stuff and went out to the world the bible said he wished it was what riot is living when do everything the world was doing the smoking the drinking the gambling they're running around he did it all until the money ran out the little gifts ran out but god had blessed them with it ran out amen he began to being want the bible saying you will be in one god's applying all your needs right now remember he's applying all your needs right now right leave the father's house see what happened to you you can be unwarmed you're gonna be in need but thank you to god the bible says he came to himself somebody clicked in his head i don't know what happened when someone clicked in his head he came to him said the bible says how much my how much my my father's servant got in my father's house and i'm out here perishing with hunger he's i'm going back home amen well lord see in the father's house he had no need i want in the father's house he had no need of nothing and when he came to himself he recognized that did y'all just hear about this oh hallelujah he recognized that when he was in his father's house he had no need he had everything supplied everything was just going smooth one he was where in his father's house everything was going but then but by the grace of god god allowed him to come to himself he said no i'm going back home he said father i've sinned against heaven and against thee no more words that we call our godless son but he can never not be called his son you can never not be called that i don't care what your child do you always gonna identify with him whether to do good or bad you're gonna identify with them i don't care if they're in prison that's still your son okay where did he act that's through your son the father recognized that his father was in bad shape but guess what he did not recognize that that was his son hallelujah he was so spiritual the bible says he saw something coming from a long ways off i thought about that a long ways off he might have seen a vision the bible says solve them a long ways off let's read that by the grace of god he might have saw a vision man god might see you when you're spiritual god we'll show you a thing about your children when you praying like the lord said pray and do everything god will show you things about your children when caroline get in trouble pamela my wife no pamela no so she know i'm telling she knows she knows says doing something right something going on with caroline sure enough she called is that me right god assure you your children your children just this father had a spiritual eye i mean he he he was able to see his son from a far off the bible said luke 15 amen praise the lord luke 15. amen amen amen in 11 honestly amen praise the lord amen praise god amen praise the lord uh luke 15 and 20. and he arose and came to the father but was yet a great way off i thought i think i thought about that right he said a great way off now even with 20 20 you can't see a great way off i say even with 20 20 you can't see a great way off so he hadn't seen a vision of a son coming home he saw a vision god showed him a vision that boy you've been praying for guess what he's on his way back home amen you know you you didn't give up on though you went to screen didn't do what he did he didn't respect your house and respect your rules didn't respect nothing and he went and screamed but you never gave up you kept on praying and believing amen that boy kingdom said you know god doesn't the same way he will never give up on us he go he's gonna go and hunt one he said if a man have a hundred sheep and one goal scream he'll leave the 90 and nine they're gonna get that what that one god will come and get us if we as children we will always get his children jesus said i'm come to seek and to save that which is what lost the father said this is my son he once was lost but none was found amen amen he saw him a great way off and as far as sodom had compassion and ran and fell in the neck and kissed him and you know what the son said amen praise god he's absent against heaven and against thee amen but 24 verses this my son was dead and is alive he was lost and he's fine amen amen his face background where he's supposed to be he's back where he's supposed to be where in the father's house you want to be in the father's house no no don't ever leave the fire young people don't ever leave the father's house i'm talking naturally now hey man don't leave your your mama and daddy house unless the law leaves you all your you got to get permission sometime to leave you

can get all you can amen don't be in the rush to leave home that young man was going to rush to leave home they're going to see what they didn't do in the world but he got messed up but thanks be to god he remembered that he could always go home to his father's house in the same way with us god can always oh lord we might mess up come on somebody we might do something wrong but guess what if we just we repeat we can come back god will take us back young man repented he's our sin against heaven and before thee i'm not worthy to call your son make me one of the highest sermons everybody repented and he came back and the father received them back i said if you went to school this morning from the father all you got to do repent god will take you back amen like nothing happened you put

wrong and here he come back and then all mess up and everything he get in the kill a fatter calf doesn't put a robe on a thing on his hand some people will get mad but thank god he's our heavenly
