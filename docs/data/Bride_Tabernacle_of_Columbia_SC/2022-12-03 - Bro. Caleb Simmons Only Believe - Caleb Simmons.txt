you for coming in your house one more time Lord thank you for bringing us through another week Lord Jesus Lord we thank you for your glory Lord we thank you for your power Lord we thank you for your anointing in this place Lord we ask that you will come down lord and speak to every need Lord move us out of the way and Lord may you get all the glory the honor and the praise in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'd like to turn to the Book of Mark Mark chapter 9. and we'll start at verse 23. Mark chapter 9 and verse 23 when you got it say Amen amen and it reads and Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believers and straightway the father of the child crawled out and said with tears Lord I believe help down my unbelief amen God bless the reading of the word you may be seated Amen on tonight I'd like to take a little topic a little simple topic that says only believe only believe in this scripture here we read about a man who had a troubled son his son was vexed with with demons that was bothering him the spirit of death and the spirit of dumb they were bothering him and they caused him to do unruly things and this son he finally the father came and he said I got to find some help he said I got to go to someone that can help me my child is vexed with a spirit and he went to the disciples and the disciples he said he knew that they were men of Faith so he said he turned to the disciples and he asked him to pray for him and that he may be healed but the disciple disciples they prayed and they prayed and Jesus wasn't there and they cannot cast them out and he came to him and and and when Jesus came he he was asking them what's going on what's what's going on and the father said I brought my son that he might be delivered when Jesus told him that thou can't believe all things are possible to him now believeth and the father said Lord I believe and help my um thou my unbelief in Jesus laid his hands on him and he caused the spirit to come out of the young man because that father he believed for his son's healing he believed that God can do the impossible he believed that God can take over this situation where the demons seem to control his son God could still heal him God could deliver him and there was no one else that could do it but Jesus the disciples couldn't do it and he reads now in verse 29 and it says and and they asked the disciples asked the Lord they asked him and they and they said Lord why couldn't we do it why could we not cast them out in verse 28 and now in verse 29 and he said unto unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting see the disciples had not come to the point where they had put in the time even though they believe God God told them you still got to do some more work not only you got to believe but you got to pray and fast and get a hold of God till you know that something has happened and no in this man of God he said Lord I believe help my unbelief and I want to speak to and say only believe all things are possible see there are many instances in the Bible where we see where where people believe and God changed their situations God changed the dire into something that it would seem to be on Impossible in Mark chapter 2 we'll turn there Mark chapter 2. this is another instance of of some people that believed there are many opportunities in the Bible where you see an individual believe but how about the ones that are around you and this story is there was a man and we'll read and we'll start at verse one and again he entered the Capernaum after some days and it was noise that he was in the house and straightway many were gathered together in so much that there was no room to receive them no not so much of as about the door and he preached the word unto them and they can't come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy that was born of four uh born means to be carried and when they they cannot come nigh unto him for the Press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they have broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay when Jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy son thou sins be forgiven thee see there was some friends that had faith and believed that God could heal their friend they believed that even though this man I was sick he couldn't get to Jesus but I had the faith they had the faith that Jesus could heal them so they said that even though he can't get there I can stand in in a seed form I can bring him to Jesus and let God do his work I can bring him even though we may have to press through Jesus said he saw that faith and he said unto the sick of Paul's son not sins be forgiven and in that moment he was healed God had done the thing for their friend because they believed they believed that that all things were possible and we can just get to Jesus if we can bring him to Jesus all things are possible and see that's that's what sometimes it's not just your faith it can be the faith of the ones around you the Bible says the Bible says let the weak let the strong bear the infirmities of the weak because many of times they're going to be moments and times where you're not you're not at full strength but those that are around you can uplift you because they believe that God can do a work for you they believe that God can intervene in your situation it's the ones around you that can uplift you and hold you up and say Lord I know that you will I know that they're down but Lord you can lift them up Lord I know that they're sick but I know you're a Healer Lord I know that they're in a situation they need Deliverance Lord I'm asking you to move on their case see these four friends they believe that God could heal their friend they believe that we have faith that even though we may have to go through something we may have to unbury this root uncover this route but we're gonna get to Jesus we're going to get in our prayer closet we're going to get down on our knees and say Lord help them Lord help them they can't get to you but Lord I can intercede for them I can press my way to to you and Lord I want you to do a work for them see that sometimes it's the ones around you that can uplift you it's the ones around you that can make sometimes the Lord impress on your heart to pray for someone and though in those moments they may be going through something that you may not know you may not understand but God has you there interceding for them to strengthen them to lift them up to bring them out of what they may be going through so there's multiple instances in the Bible where we see this it was a woman in the book of Kings it was and the Bible calls her the shooter by woman and she had she was she was bearing without child and one day the the prophet of the Lord went by a house and because she blessed the prophet of the Lord he she asked her what what does she want what and she said nothing and then the servant of God said then they don't have a child so God blessed them with a child and when they came forward and then one day the child got sick it got so sick that the child died and the wife she said I'm going to find the prophet of God I'm going to ask him and when the prophet of God seen her he told his servant to go out and ask her was everything all right and she said all is well see she had Faith she believed that no matter how dire the situation looked all was well and when the prophet came she said you got to come back to the house and she and he says everything right she said all is well and so he came back to the house because of how she was acting and and then she said her son had had passed away and he's he went in there in the room and laid on him and he breathed the breath of life into him and God brought him back because she believed a mother believed for her child that God could do the impossible a mother stood in the Gap and said my child can no longer but Lord you prom you gave me this child and you didn't give him just to take them back for from me and see see she believed all it takes is one to believe that God can do the impossible and the impossible can happen tonight all it takes is one person to believe that God can do the impossible and the impossible can take place see God is the god of the impossible he's the god that can do the things that are unseen through the things that we can't even imagine God can do those things just like this you know my woman death is the final stage but God brought him back to life see she believed that God could do it she believed that God was the one that was able to do the impossible see there's another instance where I look in the Book of Mark chapter 10 and there was a man that was blind he was a beggar and he sat on the side on the road and he heard that Jesus was passing by they called him Bartimaeus and when he passed by he said he said Son of David Son of David have mercy on me son of David Son of David have mercy on me and the other people around him said be quiet we trying to hear him or be quiet you too loud but he said Son of David Son of David have mercy on me see this man didn't care what anyone else thought about him he didn't care that they told him to be quiet he knew that Jesus was passing by see he believed that if I can get to Jesus something was going to happen for me if I believe that if I can get to Jesus my situation can change I believe that if I get to Jesus then God will do something for me he says son of David have mercy on me and Jesus heard him and he told him to come to him paraphrasing he told him to come to him and when he got to him he said what what would you what would what can I give you he said Lord I want my sight and God and God and the Lord blessed him with his sight and he and he was thanking God and praised God and he followed him because of what God had done had done for him see he had the faith to believe that all things were possible he had the faith that if I can get to Jesus my situation will change if I only believe that I can get to him I know he can do something for me I know that he can change my my circumstances see I'm a beggar but if I can receive my sight I can provide if I if I can receive my sight I can do the things that I need to do that God positioned me and Abel and place me to do in this life see that's what he was looking for see if you can only believe James said in James chapter 4 he said you have not because you're as not and you act and when you ask you ask a miss see James was trying to point out that many times we asked but we don't ask in the right Spirit we don't ask for the right things sometimes we ask for wants and not needs sometimes we ask for things that that God may not want to give to us because he knows that we can't handle it sometimes we ask for things that we can't see that it's a trap down the road but God can so he doesn't give it to us see there's many things but he said if only you can believe all things are possible and see there's a story in the in the Book of Mark in the book of in the Book of Luke actually Luke chapter 8 and it's a it's a Pharisee who one day his daughter got sick and and the Pharisee was Jerry Jarius and he said that he might have thought about his status he might have thought about where he had made it in position in life he might have thought about all the things that he had achieved achieved but he got to a certain point in place where he realized I have a need see Jerry has had a need and he had a need because his only child was dying and that's the same thing that it is tonight see when you get to a place that you get a need that no one else can fix it but God when you get to that place that you realize I got a need that no one else can do anything about this but God see you your face start to rise because you realize that I can't turn to the right I can't turn to the left I can't turn go forward or go back God has to lead me through this see Jerry has got to that point where he had a need and he said I I I've heard I've searched the scriptures I understand that I know that this is the one true God and see he said the daughter was dying and many people might have tried to convince him at that house not to go follow she find Jesus but he he realized that he had a need and he had to go it was time for him to take action it was time for him not to just believe in secret but to go and find Jesus to go search him out and go find where Jesus was because he had a need see he believed that if I can get to Jesus my daughter can be healed if I can get to Jesus I know he can change the situation see it was a Time for Action and and see Jerry has had to get to Christ he had to get Christ on the scene or his child would die he had to hurry real quick he he had to spring into action he had to get into action to find Jesus see Jesus wasn't right there with them he had to go in search of him he had to go look for him he didn't necessarily might not have known where he was but he had to go find him because he knew he the only one that could turn this situation around was Jesus and he said somebody said faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God see you got to have faith you got to believe that all things are possible you got to believe that God can change your situation and see when they were there first thing and they come along and he said he walked down and see you understanding that Jerry is he might have was looking and then something happened while he was on his way to Jesus there was another thing that occurred during during when Jarius was on his way he noticed that there was a woman that was in the crowd and maybe he recognized her maybe he didn't he noticed that she was making her way she was trying to push her way through the Thrones of people to get to Jesus and there was many people in the way and she might have she might have couldn't push away she might have had to get down on her hands and knees to get to Jesus she might have had to crawl but she said any way I can get there I gotta get there because I need Jesus to do something for me any way that I it doesn't matter what stands in my way I gotta get to Jesus because I believe that if I can Touch the Hem of His Garment I know that my sicknesses will be well I know that God will do will heal my body see she didn't care what was in her way she just believed that if she could get to Jesus all would be well and see Jerry is smarter watched that and not matter it might have gave him some faith that you know what I know that if I can get to Jesus he can fix my situation if God can do that for her and when she touched him of Jesus garment it took some virtue out of him and Jesus looked around and he said who touched me who touched me and Peter and the disciples say Lord we packed with people around me what do you mean who touched me but Jesus knew that virtue had left them and he and when he did it she said Lord I he she said I touched you he said go thy way thy faith has made thee well see she her faith because she believed the Lord healed her see if you can only believe tonight God can do something miraculous for you he said I imagine that encouraged old Jarius don't you imagine so directly here he come running through and said Lord my little girl is laying now at the point of death Lord Master oh yes he's all right he's not a fanatic now oh no he's got a need he's got a need of him and see as they were on their way back to his home someone came running and they said Jarius he said they might have told him don't bother now you don't have to trouble the master because your daughter has died he said they might have done later up and got her ready to burial not even embalmed her and we got the doctor to come and he pronounced to dead and charius might have he might have fought to but said Jesus was walking steadily it never bothered him a bit because Jesus said I can see him turn his eyes and he looked at him said didn't I say only believe didn't I say to you only believe and that's what I'm here to say to you only believe God's word and if you want to see the glory of God only believe no matter what anybody else says to you no matter how how they point at you and say that can never happen no matter how much they said that's impossible if you only believe God can do the impossible amen I said and he might have said my baby can't get well but only believe that's all only believe that God made the promise that he made the promise to you not me not anybody else not the preacher not the minister but God made a promise to you and if you only believe in his promise God will do what he said he would do because he said in my word go out of my mouth it can't return unto me void it must accomplish what I said it must do see God is able to do the impossible he said didn't I say unto you I only believe if you want to see the glory of God oh I can imagine I helped them don't you I imagine seeing this little heart skipping them beats but just beating back regular again said critics can say anything they want to but it takes What God Says to make it be the truth said no matter what they may say about it what God says is the truth now Jesus said only believe and you might ask the question believe what believe what now she's dead he said believe for The Impossibles yes believe for the impossible why after she's done dead and bomb believe now sure I told you just believe if you want to see the glory of God believe what you may ask and said believe anything verily I say unto you if you shall say to this mountain be thy move and don't doubt in our heart just only believe you can ask what you say that's right he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever believeth in me shall never die and if you abide in me and my word abide which in you you can ask what you will and it will be given to you isn't that right see all those promises are the book are in the book that God gave us if we only believed if we only believe that all these things are possible then they can happen for us he said the works that I do you shall do also Greater Works than this shall you do amen and all these promises here because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever see if you only believe God can do what he did back then if he brought him out of the Red Sea is your problem bigger than the Red Sea is your situation bigger than the Red Sea but he parted the Red Sea to let his children walk across on dry land because they believed that God was going to deliver them from their enemies they believed that God you promised that that we would only stay here for a little while then you would take us to our promised land and God parted the Red Seas that they can reach their promise that they can reach what he told them he would give to them how much more would he do for you how much more can he do for you if he can part the Red Seas what do you believe he can do for you so you only believe only believe because he's coming soon see he's coming sooner than we may think but we must believe that God can do it for us that God can Deliver Us from these things so we can get out of here that God can do the impossible and when they got to Jerry's house said they went through the house and there was a whole bunch of them that were sitting there and that and and when that and when Jesus he he walked up to him and said this oh she'll be all right or is that she's sleeping all the pokes in there they started laughing and then Jesus he went and then he put them out all those that see sometimes he had to separate the people that did believe from the ones that did the people that didn't believe he had to separate them he had to get him away because God couldn't work around the people that didn't believe see sometimes the folks around you can hinder your faith sometimes the one that a circle say that the closest to you be there but they can hinder your faith they can stop you from getting what God wants to give to you and Jesus removed them and he put them out because they laughed at the word yeah then he got them all out and then Jesus was alone he was alone with only the ones that he brought with him he said the Brokenhearted and the faithful he brought Peter James and John which represented a faith hope and charity and he put them in there with with the room with the with the Brokenhearted believers the ones that was there and they believed Jerry is Jarius and his wife and the little thing was laid out and he put the unbelievers away from him so when he got everything out everyone out everybody but just his faith hope and charity standing there and the faithful ones the real believe in father and mother he walked over to the corpse excuse me but if he could and Jesus but see he had to but if he could just get them shut out to a place that he could be with the Believers sometimes the Lord has to move you to a place that you're around the ones that believe that you're only around the ones that believe that have faith that God can move in your situation now have faith that God can do something that is impossible and then he walked over and he tooks her by the hand and he looked out there into the space World Yonder somewhere where her soul went and said Maiden arise see how could death exist in the presence of life how could death exist in the presence of life and all because someone believed that God that he could do the impossible all because a father believed that Jesus if I get him here he can move on my behalf if I get him in the room no matter how dire the situation may look all things are possible see all things are possible only believe what was he he was he was word of God flesh and tonight they're the same God is the same word of God is in your flesh if Christ is in is in there he's the same Lord Jesus he could touch his go you could touch His Garment or whatever you wish to if you only believe that he's here he will do the same thing for you do you believe it see God he had a way of reaching now because someone's Faith reached him because someone got down the business and said Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I believe that no matter how dire the situation may look all things are possible see he got down to the point that no matter I only I don't have no other choice I don't have no one I can turn to the doctor has given me up the doctor had given her up everyone else but said that even the servant came and said she's dead and they're there mourning her but he got to the one that he had to still believe that God could do the impossible he had to still believe the woman the shooter my woman she had to still believe that God could do the impossible the man the friends that were that if the the people that their friend was sick they still had to believe that if we could get him to Jesus all things were possible see there's so many the blind water Mayors believe that if I can call on Jesus he will answer say if I can get his attention I know Jesus can change my situation see all I have to do is believe it's so simple all you have to do is believe and God can do the impossible God can do more than you ever could think and then you can think see sometimes he has you standing in in intercession for others so God can do the work see there was a mother that had to cry for her children there was a father that had to cry for his daughter there was one that had to cry for themselves like blind Bartimaeus but they said if I can get to Jesus all things are possible if I only believe see that's what I want you to get tonight if you only believe all things are possible if you only believe that God can turn it he can do it for you if you only believe in you pray in your fashion say Lord I need I have a need you have to get to the point and say Lord I have a need Lord is not my brother it's not my sister but it's me O Lord standing here in the need of prayer Lord I
