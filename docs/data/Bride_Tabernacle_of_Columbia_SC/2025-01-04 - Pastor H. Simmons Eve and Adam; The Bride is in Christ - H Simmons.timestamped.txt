[32:59] the Book of Genesis
[33:03] 1 and
[33:05] 26 Genesis
[33:08] 1:26 appreciate brother Carl being here
[33:11] tonight
[33:13] amen 1 and
[33:16] 26 let's just start at
[33:20] 25 and it says and God made the beasts
[33:25] of the
[33:26] Earth at after his kind and the cattle
[33:29] after their kind and everything that
[33:32] creepeth upon the Earth after his kind
[33:36] and God saw that it was good and God
[33:39] said let us make man in our image after
[33:44] our likeness and let them have dominion
[33:48] over the fish of the sea and over the
[33:51] fowls of the air and over the cattle and
[33:54] over all the Earth and over every
[33:57] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[33:59] Earth so God created man in his what own
[34:03] image in his own image in the image of
[34:06] God created he him male then what fale
[34:11] created he
[34:14] them and God blessed them and God said
[34:19] unto them be
[34:21] [Music]
[34:23] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[34:26] Earth and to do it and have dominion
[34:30] over the fish of the sea and over the
[34:33] fowls of the air and over the every
[34:36] living thing that moveth upon the Earth
[34:40] may God bless the read word you may be
[34:43] seated
[34:48] amen we know that when God made
[34:52] Adam and Eve he made them to have the
[34:55] menion he gave them the Earth
[34:59] and
[35:00] God was in heaven in a sense as we look
[35:04] at it and he had Angels there to worship
[35:08] him but when God made man he said have
[35:11] dominion over the
[35:14] Earth so by the grace of God man was God
[35:20] Amen on the
[35:21] earth he was an amag of God he had
[35:26] Dominion he could speak what he said
[35:28] would come to
[35:30] pass we know that the spoken word is the
[35:33] Original
[35:35] Seed so we want to talk about in the 20
[35:43] uh in the 2 and seven and God and the
[35:48] Lord God formed man from the dust of the
[35:52] ground and breath in his nostril the
[35:55] breath of life and Man became a Liv
[35:57] living
[35:59] Soul so here we are again the first God
[36:04] made man Spirit man then God made man of
[36:08] the Dust of the
[36:09] ground
[36:11] so now people don't know how
[36:17] long Adam and Eve existed in spirit
[36:22] form but we know that when God made him
[36:26] amen
[36:28] he made him in spirit
[36:31] amen now in the 21st verse it says and
[36:36] the Lord God calls let's just read the
[36:39] 20th verse and Adam gave name to all the
[36:43] cattle and all the fouls of the air and
[36:46] every beast of the field but for Adam
[36:49] there was
[36:51] what there was not found a what help
[36:54] help meat for him and
[36:58] the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall
[37:02] upon Adam and he slept and he took one
[37:07] of his what ribs ribs and closed up the
[37:13] flesh instead thereof and the rib which
[37:17] the Lord God had taken from man made he
[37:22] a what woman a woman and bought her unto
[37:26] Adam
[37:27] and Adam said this is this is now
[37:33] what bone of my bone and
[37:37] what she shall be called
[37:40] what because she was taken out of
[37:43] man so we
[37:45] see I says tonight Eve was in Adam and
[37:50] the bride was in
[37:54] Christ I is in Christ amen
[37:58] the bride is in
[38:00] Christ
[38:02] so now we realize if the bride is in
[38:06] Christ she's not of this world and she's
[38:10] we're in we're in this world but we're
[38:13] not of this world the bride is in Christ
[38:18] now as we did that let's just go to
[38:21] First Corinthians
[38:22] [Music]
[38:24] 13 12 and 13 excuse me
[38:30] 1 Corinthians 12 and 13 God is good amen
[38:33] you love him amen we in a a a place that
[38:41] in the 12th verse he said for as the
[38:43] body is one and has many members and all
[38:49] members of the that one body being many
[38:54] are one body so also is Christ so by one
[38:59] what by one Spirit are we all what
[39:03] baptized baptized into what one body one
[39:07] body whether we be jew or Gentile
[39:10] whether we be born or free whether we
[39:13] and have been all made to drink into one
[39:18] spirit amen so by the grace of God you
[39:23] Adam and Eve was one in the beginning
[39:28] But as God servant said a Eve was not in
[39:33] the original creation she was a
[39:37] byproduct of
[39:39] Adam so it wasn't that he created Eve
[39:43] and Adam but Eve was Adam because Eve
[39:48] was taken out of Adam are you with me
[39:51] amen so Eve and Adam was
[39:54] one you see that so as that as it we and
[40:00] Christ the
[40:02] bride and Christ are
[40:05] one okay but because people don't come
[40:10] into the realization of that and because
[40:14] we don't really uh we can't uh
[40:18] comprehend it sometimes within our mind
[40:21] that you and Christ are won and perhaps
[40:24] you know uh Eve coming out of Adam amen
[40:29] maybe you know we got to recognize who
[40:33] we are before the Rapture can take place
[40:35] and we recognize who we are where we
[40:38] came from amen so we came from God amen
[40:44] amen we were in the genes or in the mind
[40:49] of God before the foundation of the
[40:52] world amen amen but we didn't know that
[40:56] but when we heard the eagle scream we
[40:59] heard the
[41:01] gospel amen we recognize who our father
[41:05] was amen we recognize that we amen were
[41:10] not of this
[41:11] world Amen that we were pris and
[41:14] strangers just passing through here amen
[41:17] amen this world is not our home I'm
[41:20] talking about the cosmos the world order
[41:22] as we say amen amen but the Bible said
[41:26] the Earth is the Lord in the fullness
[41:27] there of the world and all that dwell
[41:29] there in amen so what we're talking
[41:33] about the cosmos the the this evil age
[41:37] amen this uh Satan eat amen we're not of
[41:41] this this is not what Adam had in the
[41:46] beginning this is all been
[41:50] deformed amen uh Satan has deformed
[41:54] everything he tried to make a see Satan
[41:56] was in Heaven he tried to imitate and
[41:59] try to make a
[42:00] better amen he saw Eden in his
[42:03] glory he saw how amen it was when God
[42:07] had everything and said it was good the
[42:10] devil saw that but so he tried he tries
[42:13] to give you something Amen to take your
[42:17] hearts and Minds away from what God has
[42:22] given everything God made was
[42:25] good but he had one thing that he said
[42:28] not to do eat of the tree and not touch
[42:31] it amen Elicia
[42:35] die amen and when uh Eve listen you know
[42:40] and that's what happens sometimes amen
[42:43] we pay attention to the uh the evil one
[42:47] the devil we
[42:50] listen we listen to the wrong
[42:53] voice you know to the bride we have a
[42:55] certain sound
[42:57] but the world Listen to an uncertain
[43:00] sound amen and the Bible said God is not
[43:03] the author of
[43:05] confusion but a peace amen Jesus said my
[43:10] peace I give you not as the world give I
[43:13] the devil amen can't give you this
[43:16] peace amen because God says he gives
[43:19] them perfect peace whose mind is stad on
[43:23] him amen the devil will in in
[43:27] infiltrate I I want to talk about the
[43:29] infiltration pray of the church uh
[43:33] perhaps Sunday but uh the devil would
[43:36] infiltrate your
[43:38] mind amen and the devil has
[43:41] infiltrated your mind he has entered
[43:43] into your thought pattern Amen to get
[43:47] you to think like he thinks and that's
[43:50] what he did to Eve he he wanted to get
[43:52] her away from thinking amen like God
[43:56] Amen
[43:57] amen he wanted to make her feel like she
[44:00] needed what he had amen and he didn't
[44:03] have anything cuz he lost it all he was
[44:06] a fallen creature a fallen
[44:09] angel he had no more amen uh the glory
[44:13] that God gave him in heaven amen as a a
[44:16] co- Pastor in heaven
[44:20] amen he was next to
[44:23] God but because he wanted to take over
[44:27] and take God's place are you with me he
[44:30] fell amen and the minute amen God Amen
[44:35] puts you in a position and gives you
[44:38] things in this life and when God gives
[44:41] it to you amen then amen man can't take
[44:46] it from you amen amen amen but when you
[44:49] try to achieve things outside of the
[44:52] word and the will of God it would all
[44:55] crumble amen it'll come to not am amen
[45:00] but what you want is Jesus said Lord not
[45:04] my will but let what will now we
[45:08] understand that God was in Christ amen
[45:11] and the Bride of Jesus Christ amen is in
[45:16] Christ amen as God was in Christ Christ

[45:43] be one with
[45:44] you amen I don't want my will to be done

[45:51] as God Amen is with us all things are
[45:54] possible with them to them that
[45:59] believe we think God will never lead you
[46:04] astray amen he will never fail you amen
[46:09] you will never be disappointed with

[46:22] might have life and life and life more
[46:25] abundantly amen he wants you to live

[46:59] it's the mystical Body of Christ amen
[47:02] amen you have things common because you
[47:05] have the same spirit amen are you with
[47:08] me so it doesn't matter what country
