[34:53] [Laughter]
[34:56] bow. Lord Jesus, we thank you for

[35:00] time this morning. Lord, a songwriter
[35:02] wrote, "Lord, it's me. is me, oh Lord,
[35:05] standing in the need of prayer. And
[35:07] Lord, we need your help this morning.
[35:09] Lord, we need your guidance, your
[35:10] direction. And Lord, we need your Holy
[35:12] Ghost to come down and take complete
[35:14] control. Lord, move us all the way out
[35:17] of the way. Lord, meet all the needs,
[35:19] all the heart's desires, those that are
[35:21] spoken, those that are unspoken. Lord,
[35:23] touch the families that are in
[35:25] bereavement at this time. Touch all the
[35:27] prayer requests, Lord Jesus. Oh, we ask
[35:29] that you continue to move and touch
[35:31] every need in this service this morning.
[35:33] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[35:37] If you have your Bibles this morning,
[35:39] we're going to turn to the book of
[35:41] Philippians, chapter 3.
[35:59] Philippians chapter 3. And when you got
[36:01] it, say amen. Amen. And it reads,
[36:04] "Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the
[36:06] Lord to write the same thing to you. To
[36:09] me indeed is not grievious, but for you
[36:12] it is it is a
[36:18] safe. It is safe. Beware of dogs. Beware
[36:22] of evil workers. Beware of concision.
[36:26] For we are the
[36:28] circumcision, which worship God in the
[36:30] spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and
[36:33] have no confidence in the flesh. Though
[36:36] I might also have confidence in the
[36:38] flesh, if any man thinkketh that he hath
[36:42] whereof he might trust in the flesh, I
[36:45] more circumcised the eighth day of the
[36:48] stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin
[36:50] and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching
[36:52] the law, a Pharisee, concerning zeal,
[36:55] persecuting the church, touching the
[36:58] righteous, which is which is in the law
[37:02] blameless.
[37:04] But what things were gained of me? Those
[37:07] I counted lost for Christ. Amen. Yay.
[37:10] Doubtless. And I count all things but
[37:12] lost for the excellence excellency of
[37:15] the knowledge
[37:19] suffered of the knowledge of Christ
[37:21] Jesus my Lord. For whom I have suffered
[37:24] the loss of all things and to count them
[37:27] but dung that I may win Christ. Amen.
[37:31] But I but be found in him, not having my
[37:34] own righteousness, which is of the law,
[37:37] but that which is through the faith of
[37:39] Christ, the righteousness which is of
[37:42] God by faith, that I may know him the
[37:46] power of and the power of his
[37:49] resurrection, and the fellowship of his
[37:51] suffering, being made conformable unto
[37:54] his death, if by any means I might
[37:57] attain unto the resurrection of the
[37:59] dead, Not as though I have already
[38:02] obtained either were already perfect,
[38:05] but I follow after if that I might
[38:08] apprehend that for which also I am
[38:11] apprehended of Christ Jesus.
[38:14] Brethren, I count not myselves to have
[38:17] apprehended, but one thing I do,
[38:20] forgetting those things which are
[38:22] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[38:25] things which are before, I press toward
[38:28] the mark for the prize of the high
[38:30] calling of God in Christ
[38:33] Jesus. Amen. God bless word. You may be
[38:36] seated.
[38:40] Amen. And I like to speak on a little
[38:41] topic that I
[38:43] entitled, is heaven a
[38:46] priority? Is heaven a priority? And I
[38:49] started to think about this. I had a
[38:51] couple different things that initially I
[38:54] was going to entitled is heaven your
[38:56] goal? But I realized sometimes in life,
[38:58] you can have goals that aren't
[39:00] priorities. Amen. You can have you can
[39:03] have a goal that you set. This is a goal
[39:05] I want to achieve, but it's a far off.
[39:08] So right now it's not a priority. So I
[39:10] wanted to bring it closer and said is
[39:12] heaven a priority
[39:14] because sometimes when you organizing
[39:16] your goals you put them in what's the
[39:18] nearest thing possible that I can
[39:20] achieve or what do I want to achieve
[39:22] right now. That's right. So when you go
[39:25] to achie you you you set these goals up
[39:28] you have to prioritize your goals. Amen.
[39:31] You have to set them in order and say no
[39:33] this is what's my priority number one
[39:35] right now. My priority number two right
[39:38] now and it doesn't matter what it is in
[39:40] life, we always are looking at achieving
[39:42] something. No matter where you go and
[39:45] what you do, you always are trying to
[39:47] achieve something. If it's working on a
[39:50] job, you always trying to see, okay, how
[39:52] can I get more money? That that's some
[39:55] people's goal. That's all they don't
[39:57] want to switch jobs. They just want more
[39:59] money. Some people, it's about status.
[40:02] So, they're trying to achieve another
[40:04] level. They're trying to become a
[40:05] manager, a supervisor, or something else
[40:08] cuz that's their goal. And so they'll
[40:10] say within two years, especially in this
[40:13] day and age, they said within two years,
[40:14] you don't move up, you switch jobs.
[40:17] That's the new mentality. There's no
[40:20] more you work a job for 40 years and the
[40:22] company going to take care of you. So
[40:24] when you start to thinking about it,
[40:26] it's not about what are your goals, but
[40:27] what is your priority? Amen. Amen. And
[40:30] and what are you prioritizing in this
[40:32] time? And is even having a priority on
[40:35] your list?
[40:38] Some people got long list of priorities,
[40:40] but God is way way way down on the list.
[40:42] Even if he even shows up on the list,
[40:45] Jesus cuz you said all these things.
[40:47] This what I can achieve here and I can
[40:49] achieve this and I'll do this and I'll
[40:51] do this and somewhere on the list, God
[40:53] ain't even on it.
[40:55] There's no, hey, I want to grow closer
[40:57] to God. Hey, I want to do this to grow
[40:59] closer to God. There's no strategic
[41:01] thinking about how can I get closer to
[41:03] God. There's a list of priorities of how
[41:06] I can do better at work, how I can do
[41:08] better at school, how I can do better at
[41:11] doing this, how can I get a car that I
[41:13] want, how can I and you're setting aside
[41:16] all these things. Not only that, you're
[41:18] planning for
[41:19] it. You're planning for it. Hey, if I
[41:22] got to if I want to buy a car in the
[41:23] next year, I want to save up this much
[41:25] money now. I want to put this much in an
[41:27] account. I want to have my ducks in a
[41:30] row. But we don't do God the same way.
[41:34] We don't look at God and say, "Hey, I'm
[41:36] looking that." Cuz sometimes we come to
[41:38] God and think that everything's supposed
[41:40] to be
[41:41] instantaneous. When we come to God, we
[41:43] don't think that hey, that Lord, I was
[41:47] supposed to be preparing for what you
[41:48] were going to send me. That's right.
[41:50] It's just that God was going to send it
[41:51] to me and then we initially and then we
[41:54] call it a blessing. Cuz when God does
[41:57] what we ask him to, then we say, "Oh, it
[41:59] was a great blessing." But we didn't
[42:01] realize that, hey, hey, it took some it
[42:04] took some work to get it. Like he said,
[42:06] faith without works is dead. So, you had
[42:09] to prepare for it. Even though you
[42:10] didn't realize it, there was some times
[42:12] that you was praying for it that while
[42:14] you was asking, you was in the midst of
[42:16] praying for it. You was seeking after
[42:18] it. You had a sole focus on what you
[42:20] wanted God to do. Amen. And when you got
[42:22] that soul focused, God realized how
[42:25] serious you were. God realized, hey,
[42:28] they got a priority. They want me to do
[42:30] this. And while they want me to do this,
[42:32] they praying for it. They asking for it.
[42:34] They seeking me for it. They reading
[42:36] scriptures about it, having more faith,
[42:38] and increasing everything. When you want
[42:40] God to do something for you, and it's a
[42:42] what you call a blessing. You you see
[42:45] people sending you scriptures on faith.
[42:47] You ain't even got to go look for them
[42:49] no more. and see it's encouraging you.
[42:52] But the same way that we look at God and
[42:54] say, "Lord, I need you to move in this
[42:56] situation." Are we looking at it and
[42:59] saying, "I got this much focus on going
[43:01] to heaven." Amen. I got that much focus
[43:04] on going to heaven. I'm aligning
[43:06] everything in my life so that Lord, when
[43:09] you come, I'm going back with you. Amen.
[43:11] Amen. Amen. But are is it a priority for
[43:16] us even on our on our things? And I know
[43:19] it's easy to to get caught up in
[43:22] life because you get caught up on doing
[43:25] this and doing that and doing this and
[43:27] doing that. It's not that you forget God
[43:29] is that you always you seeing God move
[43:32] in your life, but you're not setting it
[43:34] as something that's in the forefront of
[43:37] my life. Everything you know happens by
[43:40] the way of God and you know God does
[43:42] everything. He works it all to the good.
[43:44] But are you setting it down as a
[43:46] priority of setting your relationship
[43:48] with God as something that you truly
[43:51] focus on? Amen. Like you know God is
[43:54] moving and you see him doing all the
[43:56] works, but are you focused on having
[43:58] that relationship with him? Are you
[44:00] doing the small things every day that
[44:03] can have a continual communion with God
[44:06] that each and every day that you can
[44:07] speak to him, talk to him and he talks
[44:10] back to you? See, we we see the God do
[44:12] the big things, but what about in the
[44:14] small things? Said
[44:18] said, I think about Elijah when when the
[44:21] spirit of God and he was there and they
[44:23] sent him. It was in the fire. It was in
[44:25] the wind and it was and through the
[44:26] storm and these different things, but it
[44:28] wasn't until he heard that small still
[44:30] voice. He said that that that I know
[44:33] that's God right there. That's small.
[44:34] See, he was able to recognize the voice
[44:36] of God because he knew what it sounded
[44:39] like. He wasn't looking for the big
[44:41] thing. He wasn't looking for the grand
[44:43] thing. Even though he knew God was doing
[44:45] those things, he saw it and he knew that
[44:47] these are only acts of God. But but he
[44:51] he got down and he recognized the voice
[44:54] of God that was speaking to him because
[44:57] he had that personal relationship with
[44:59] God that Lord, I know your voice. As he
[45:01] said, my sheep, they know my voice. So,
[45:05] so when when you know God and God knows
[45:07] you, you recognize when he's speaking to
[45:09] you. You recognize when he he's trying
[45:12] to make you turn left when you want to
[45:14] go right and he's trying to make you go
[45:16] right when you want to go left and and
[45:19] and you're more susceptible to listening
[45:21] when you have that relationship.
[45:24] You ever had someone walk up to you and
[45:26] tell you to do something and you didn't
[45:28] know
[45:30] them? Yeah. So that you didn't know them
[45:33] and and and you and and they might have
[45:36] looked like they was
[45:38] um they was a little out of
[45:42] it. Now some people they get to when
[45:45] they meet somebody random like that,
[45:47] they go ahead and dismiss the
[45:50] message because of how the person
[45:52] looked or how they seem to be acting in
[45:56] that moment. Now, no matter whether that
[45:57] message was true or
[45:59] not, you you didn't think about the
[46:01] message. You just discounted it because
[46:03] of where it came
[46:05] from. But you ever had someone close to
[46:07] you tell you it's the same thing.
[46:09] Sometimes it can have a different
[46:11] weight. It can have a different effect.
[46:13] And the same thing is with God. It's
[46:15] different when you hear from God every
[46:17] blue moon versus when you talk to him
[46:19] every day. Amen. It's different. Those
[46:22] relationships are different. But you
[46:25] see, God has a way of working out of the
[46:27] stranger as he does out of the person
[46:30] that's close to you. He has a working of
[46:33] working every day. And sometimes he does
[46:35] the great things for you. He allows you
[46:37] to see that. Hey, listen. If you put me
[46:39] first, all these things will be added to
[46:41] you. Whether it's big or small, all
[46:44] these things will be added to you. And
[46:47] so he allows you to see that, hey, if
[46:49] you put this as a priority, all the
[46:52] things that you're trying to reach and
[46:54] achieve will come along with the
[46:55] package. Amen. It's a package service
[46:58] that you didn't realize all these things
[47:00] was included in the package. Amen. But
[47:03] also in the package was trials and
[47:05] tribulations. Amen. Amen. But you have
[47:07] that that comes along with the package.
[47:10] But after every trial and after every
[47:12] tribulation, there's a reward. Amen.
[47:14] See, the devil just take you through
[47:16] trials and tribulations and that's it.
[47:18] There ain't no reward to it. But when
[47:22] God takes you through, it's something to
[47:24] build up your character. It's something
[47:26] to make you a better person, to make you
[47:28] stronger in him, to allow you to grow,
[47:30] for you to see that, hey, all things do
[47:32] work together to the good. Amen. I don't
[47:36] have to understand it to believe that
[47:37] God is doing it. Amen.
[47:39] and say when you put go put it as a
[47:42] priority, you you start to realize uh
[47:45] how how
[47:47] how different your relationship with God
[47:50] can be. Yes. How different your
[47:53] relationship with God can be and and
[47:56] realizing that that he said in John 14:6
[47:58] say he said I am the way, the truth and
[48:01] the life. No man cometh under the father
[48:02] but by me. See see these are things that
[48:06] I thought about it. And I said,
[48:07] "Sometimes you got to take it as like
[48:09] running a
[48:11] race." And when you're running the race,
[48:13] sometimes when you running a long long
[48:15] long distance race, not a short race, a
[48:19] long distance race, a marathon, a
[48:21] triathlon, one of those. Many of times,
[48:24] they'll provide things on the side for
[48:26] you. If you running a long distance, I
[48:29] think of triathlon. This guy, he he had
[48:32] packed snacks along the way to run this
[48:34] race. He he there were stops along the
[48:37] way for you to grab water and grab these
[48:40] things because you needed the energy to
[48:42] keep going. That's right. You needed the
[48:43] energy to keep going. And I said, when
[48:46] when you set things as a priority, it's
[48:48] not that everything else doesn't matter.
[48:51] It's that you have a renewed focus on
[48:54] what's important. Amen.
[48:56] And and during the race, sometimes you
[48:59] have to get these energy boosts to have
[49:01] a renewed focus on what's what's
[49:03] important, what matters, and what
[49:05] actually am I doing while I'm running
[49:07] this race? Am I just running aimlessly
[49:10] in circles? Or do I have a goal? Is
[49:12] there something that I'm trying to
[49:14] strive for? Is there something that I'm
[49:16] trying to achieve here while I'm running
[49:18] this race? Yeah. Many of times some
[49:20] people they on the endless tread on the
[49:22] treadmill and they just running. They
[49:25] don't even know why they running and
[49:27] they wonder why they struggling with
[49:28] what they going through because they
[49:31] just running and they have no goal in
[49:33] mind. Hey, I want to hit a mile in this
[49:35] much time or hey, I want to I want to
[49:37] run this run this 5K or something like
[49:40] that. When you have a goal in mind, it's
[49:42] easier to work towards that goal. Cuz
[49:45] today I might not hit that 3.1 miles,
[49:48] but even if I hit a half a mile running
[49:50] it straight, hey, I I've done something
[49:52] towards my goal. Amen. And it's the same
[49:56] way with God each and every day. Like
[49:58] you don't have to expect, oh my God, I'm
[50:00] going to have visions tomorrow. Now if
[50:02] God gives it to you, hey there, that's
[50:04] different. But you know sometimes and
[50:07] that might not be even the gift that God
[50:08] want to give you.
[50:10] But there's something that he has for
[50:12] each and every last one of us. There's
[50:14] something that he wants each and every
[50:16] last one of us to do. And sometimes he's
[50:18] waiting for you to elevate to a level
[50:20] that he can put you in position for you
[50:22] to do it. He's waiting for you to get in
[50:25] position for you to say, "Lord, Lord, I
[50:27] have surrendered it all and I truly have
[50:30] given you everything. Lord, I put
[50:32] everything to the side. I've done like
[50:34] Paul. I set aside everything and I've
[50:37] counted all that I've gained to be
[50:39] lost." Amen. Amen. And I realized that
[50:42] Lord, the only thing that matters is me
[50:45] is me going to heaven. I realize the
[50:48] only thing that matters is me making
[50:49] this a priority in my life. Is me
[50:52] setting aside everything else and say
[50:54] even though if I achieve these things,
[50:56] that's great, but it's not the most
[50:58] important thing. Even if I do these
[51:01] things and they might not be wrong, it
[51:04] just might be a part of the journey, but
[51:06] it's not the ultimate end of my journey.
[51:08] It's not where I want to end up. It's
[51:10] just a stop on where I'm going. Amen.
[51:12] See, some people they get to points and
[51:14] this is all that they wanted to achieve
[51:17] and that's
[51:18] it. And they get there and they say, you
[51:21] know what, I'm good. I'm
[51:22] satisfied. But I I said don't get satis.
[51:26] That's why I asked where is heaven on
[51:28] your priority
[51:29] list? I is it somewhere deep down the
[51:32] list? I want to achieve all these things
[51:34] before I start prioritizing going to
[51:37] heaven. or is it something that you know
[51:40] it's towards the top but it ain't on the
[51:43] top. See sometimes it can be towards the
[51:46] top but not on the top and realizing
[51:49] that the things of God are so important
[51:51] that they should be in this day and time
[51:53] it should be right there as a number one
[51:56] priority. Amen. It should be there's so
[51:58] many things and so many signs of the
[52:00] time if you read and you study you
[52:02] realize that hey we might not have that
[52:05] much more time to be here. Amen. Amen.
[52:07] Amen. And even if we do, that doesn't
[52:10] mean it's any less important. Amen. Even
[52:12] if we got another 50 to 100 years, which
[52:15] we don't know, but it could be. I mean,
[52:18] 50 or 100 years ago, they wasn't saying
[52:20] that we would last to this time. So, I
[52:22] mean, so we don't know that God only
[52:24] knows the timing that we have. But even
[52:27] if it's not, if it's if it's if it is to
[52:31] be, that doesn't make heaven less of a
[52:33] priority. That doesn't mean that God
[52:35] ain't coming back tomorrow. That doesn't
[52:37] mean that he can't take us out of here
[52:39] cuz everybody has a time and a season.
[52:42] So you never know that. Yeah, this could
[52:44] be your last moment. Might not be
[52:46] anybody, but it could be your last
[52:48] moment. And where is heaven on your
[52:50] priority list? See, it's an individual
[52:53] thing that you got to ask yourself.
[52:55] Amen. Amen. That you got to come to and
[52:58] and and I wrote something down. I said,
[53:00] "How are you prep uh like how are you
[53:03] preparing to get there? How are you
[53:06] preparing to achieve this priority? How
[53:09] what steps have you laid out that you
[53:11] put in the row and say this is what I'm
[53:13] going to do to work to work on my
[53:15] relationship with God? This is what I'm
[53:16] going to do to get stronger in the Lord.
[53:18] This is what I'm going to do to focus on
[53:21] me becoming closer to God." Amen. Amen.
[53:24] Have you asked those questions to
[53:26] yourself? Amen. Cuz those are something
[53:27] that each and every last one of us have
[53:29] to ask ourselves. Amen. Now, the prophet
[53:32] of God said, "You want to grow closer to
[53:33] God, he said, read your Bible and pray
[53:35] every day." And I think if you start,
[53:38] that's where you can start. But once you
[53:41] start there, you you you start to build
[53:43] up a habit and and it'll get so good to
[53:46] you. You'll start to read deeper and
[53:48] you'll start to trying to understand
[53:49] things and asking God for wisdom and
[53:52] understanding to break down his word to
[53:54] you. Amen. It doesn't always take the
[53:57] preacher. It's something that you got to
[53:58] do yourself. And that God allowed the
[54:01] men of God and to place them there that
[54:04] they can break it down in ways that you
[54:05] can understand it. That's why you come
[54:08] to them and ask them questions and and
[54:10] God placed them there that they may have
[54:12] wisdom and understanding to break it
[54:13] down so you can get a deeper knowledge
[54:15] and a deeper understanding of it. Amen.
[54:22] Amen.
[54:27] Yes. So, so and and I started I started
[54:30] thinking about it and understanding that
[54:33] hey, listen, it takes you it takes you
[54:35] examining your own
[54:37] self cuz I can't tell you what's on your
[54:40] priority list. I can't tell you the
[54:43] goals that you want to achieve, but I
[54:45] promise you, if you put this if you put
[54:47] this as the number one priority, all the
[54:49] other ones will work out. Amen. Amen.
[54:51] All the other ones will fall into place.
[54:54] Cuz I guarantee you, you got goals on
[54:56] there that you don't even know how they
[54:58] going to uh work out. You don't even
[55:01] know if they're the right goals that I
[55:03] should be striving for. Cuz sometimes
[55:05] you'll write something down. If you ever
[55:07] look back over your life, you might have
[55:09] had a goal. And once you live long
[55:11] enough, you can look back and about five
[55:13] or 10 years ago, 15 years ago, for some
[55:17] people longer. And they might have said
[55:19] by this time I want to achieve
[55:22] this. And if you look back, you realize
[55:25] the pathway of you achieving if you
[55:27] achieved it. That's if it the pathway
[55:31] that you might have that God took you on
[55:34] to allow you to achieve what you said
[55:36] you wanted to achieve by this was
[55:38] totally different than how you thought
[55:40] or how you imagine I was stacking all
[55:43] this stuff up to achieve it. And so when
[55:46] when when God has a way of taking you
[55:49] through this that and the other to lead
[55:51] you to where he wants you to be. Amen.
[55:54] And he has, excuse me, he has a way of
[55:58] allowing
[55:59] us that when he takes us through, it
[56:02] prepares us for what for for for for
[56:04] what's coming and what may come down the
[56:07] line. But it's all in what where where
[56:09] have you put your priorities. Where have
[56:12] you set your pathway for? And what are
[56:14] you trying what are you trying to
[56:16] achieve?
[56:18] Many people don't think about what am I
[56:20] trying to achieve. That's right. They
[56:21] just go do a thing. Amen. And then they
[56:24] look at and then then they're always in
[56:25] a reaction mode because they did this
[56:28] thing that it had a consequence and they
[56:30] did this thing and it had a consequence.
[56:32] They never think before they go do the
[56:34] thing, why am I doing this? Amen. Amen.
[56:38] And I think sometimes we don't think
[56:40] about it because we don't want to think
[56:42] about it. We don't want to consider the
[56:45] consequences of what might happen and
[56:47] like if we go and do this thing bless we
[56:50] don't want to think about it cuz you
[56:51] know that's too much
[56:53] negativity you know that just put me in
[56:55] a bad space you know be and that's the
[56:59] way we get but sometimes that can be a
[57:01] trap of the enemy that can be something
[57:04] the devil allows us to use and he's and
[57:07] then you notice it becomes a habit to
[57:09] you just start doing stuff. Amen. And
[57:12] then you say, "I deal with it later. I
[57:14] deal with it later." Well, when is later
[57:16] going to come cuz you you done st
[57:19] stockpile so much up eventually you you
[57:22] in front of later and it's there and now
[57:25] and now you got to deal with a whole lot
[57:27] of stuff that you could have dealt with
[57:29] individually here there and it wouldn't
[57:31] seem so overwhelming when you got there.
[57:34] But you see you you didn't set out, hey,
[57:36] why am I doing this? What is my
[57:38] priority? And why why am I what am I
[57:41] trying to achieve when I do this? Amen.
[57:44] What am I trying to gain? What will I
[57:46] gain if I do this? Cuz some things when
[57:48] you look at it, you'll be like, "This is
[57:50] a net zero.
[57:52] I'm doing this thing and it's a it's
[57:54] causing me to do this and cause me to do
[57:56] that and I end up in the
[57:59] loss." And after enough of those, you
[58:02] got to say, "Hey, why in the world am I
[58:04] doing this? I'm making this." Like they
[58:07] said, the definition of insanity is
[58:09] doing the same thing over and over and
[58:10] over and expecting a different result.
[58:14] But sometimes we get to we'll say that
[58:16] we did it differently cuz we think that
[58:18] it was a it's a different version of the
[58:21] same issue.
[58:23] But we never sat down to think about it
[58:25] and be like, you know, that's the same
[58:26] issue.
[58:28] Just a different version. You know,
[58:30] that's the same
[58:32] issue. Just a different personalities in
[58:35] the issue. That's right. You know,
[58:36] that's the same issue. The same issue I
[58:38] had with mama is the same issue I had my
[58:40] boss. It's the same one I had with this
[58:42] person in the thought. Oh, I didn't
[58:44] realize I had issue with listening to
[58:46] people. Lord, Jesus, cuz I I never sat
[58:50] down and cuz I never wanted to sit down
[58:52] and think about it. Amen. But if you
[58:55] thought about it and prayed about it,
[58:56] maybe somebody you hear somebody say,
[58:58] "Hey, you need to you need to do
[58:59] something about this." Somebody that
[59:01] cared about you and say, "Hey, son, you
[59:03] need to work on your anger. Mhm. Mhm.
[59:08] Uh-huh. And when you And when you think
[59:10] about it, sometimes it's a hard thing to
[59:12] sit down and say, you know what, this is
[59:14] something I need to take to God. Amen.
[59:18] This is something that I don't think
[59:19] might not be an issue, but you know, you
[59:22] can't see yourself better than somebody
[59:23] sitting outside of you.
[59:26] And sometimes God is trying to work on
[59:28] you and mold you for the next stages and
[59:30] phases of your life. Amen. And God is
[59:32] trying to tell you, "Hey, there's a
[59:34] little bit more chiseling I need to do
[59:35] on you. There's a little bit more work I
[59:37] need to do on you. There's a little bit
[59:39] more I need to knock out of you." Amen.
[59:42] Like, you come this far and you done.
[59:44] You done all right. Yeah, you got some
[59:46] priorities, right? But some things you
[59:48] need to rearrange. Some things you need
[59:50] to redesign. Some things you need to
[59:52] figure out how to maneuver and change
[59:54] differently. Like, yeah, you got some
[59:56] things in order, but you need to work on
[59:58] it and put some more focus on this area.
[1:00:01] put some more eyes on this thing and
[1:00:03] hey, become more self-aware of what's
[1:00:06] going on.
[1:00:08] See, but God allows us sometimes he uses
[1:00:11] others to point out things in you and
[1:00:14] sometimes that's the most time that you
[1:00:16] get the most defensive.
[1:00:18] Because you see yourself differently
[1:00:21] than others see you. That's right. But
[1:00:23] that doesn't mean that what they're
[1:00:24] seeing isn't true. That's right. Amen.
[1:00:26] That doesn't mean that what they're
[1:00:28] seeing isn't something that you don't
[1:00:30] you don't need to work on. That doesn't
[1:00:32] mean that hey, they can see some they
[1:00:34] can see some of your list by how you
[1:00:36] react.
[1:00:38] They can see what you prioritizing by
[1:00:40] the actions that you take. They can see
[1:00:43] what you are doing by they can almost
[1:00:46] they they might not can tell everything,
[1:00:48] but they'll realize, hey, hey, listen.
[1:00:51] Something something ain't right with
[1:00:53] your
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:00:54] list. and and whether whether you want
[1:00:57] to admit it or
[1:00:58] not, it can be true. Mhm. It's just
[1:01:02] because when you when certain things are
[1:01:04] priorities on your list, you're going to
[1:01:06] act a certain way. Amen. You're going to
[1:01:08] do certain things and certain things are
[1:01:10] going to be important to you above all
[1:01:12] else. Amen. When God when God is the
[1:01:14] head of your list, certain things you
[1:01:16] gonna try to do if you if you ain't
[1:01:18] helping, you gonna try to make it to
[1:01:20] church. Amen. You're gonna try to be in
[1:01:22] service. You going to try You going to
[1:01:23] try to be around the things of God. You
[1:01:25] going to try to not be in certain
[1:01:27] places. Amen. Amen. Because it's a
[1:01:30] priority about being in the right space
[1:01:32] and right relationship with God. You
[1:01:34] going to try to not do certain things.
[1:01:37] Even if that's your struggle and your
[1:01:38] battle, you going to try everything
[1:01:40] within you to fight that because it's a
[1:01:42] priority with you being right with God.
[1:01:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:47] When it slips on the priority list,
[1:01:49] things start to slip in there. Amen. And
[1:01:52] you wonder what happened. Amen. Well,
[1:01:54] check out your list. Check out and see,
[1:01:58] hey, where's your priorities? Check out
[1:02:00] and see, hey, is it still a pri is God
[1:02:04] still the number one priority? Is making
[1:02:06] it to heaven still the number one
[1:02:08] priority? If it is, then I then
[1:02:10] something done slipped up in here. I
[1:02:13] done let something come on the list and
[1:02:15] I moved up too high and it's too
[1:02:16] important to me that it shouldn't be.
[1:02:19] Amen.
[1:02:21] See, sometimes sometimes you don't
[1:02:23] realize it, but you've gotten almost to
[1:02:25] the place where God is the 1A and you
[1:02:27] got a 1B
[1:02:29] instead of just God being number one.
[1:02:31] Amen.
[1:02:33] And and and it it it becomes a real
[1:02:36] thing. But you have to examine it. You
[1:02:39] have to sit down and say, "Lord, have I
[1:02:41] gotten to that place? Lord, have have I
[1:02:44] gotten to a place that this isn't a
[1:02:46] number one priority? It's not that I
[1:02:48] don't believe in you. It's not that I
[1:02:50] don't see that you moving. It's not that
[1:02:52] I don't see that you doing wonderful
[1:02:53] things with Lord. Where do I have you on
[1:02:56] my list? Amen. Where do I have you
[1:02:58] moving in my and being a priority for
[1:03:01] me?
[1:03:04] I want to read something. He said, "And
[1:03:06] as Paul said, now there's one thing that
[1:03:08] I want to make sure of. While I can in
[1:03:11] my right mind, I want to make sure that
[1:03:14] I know him in the power of his
[1:03:16] resurrection. No matter what else takes
[1:03:19] place, if I die a popper and they bury
[1:03:21] me in a potter's field or my grave shall
[1:03:25] be in the bottom of the river or the
[1:03:27] sea, wherever it may be, I want to know
[1:03:30] one thing. I want to know him. That's
[1:03:34] all that counts. Now, that's right, to
[1:03:36] know him and the power of his
[1:03:39] resurrection. For I know this, there's a
[1:03:41] great big door set out in front of me,
[1:03:44] and it's called
[1:03:45] death. And it's for each one of us. And
[1:03:49] every time one heart beats, we're one
[1:03:51] beat closer to that door. It won't beat
[1:03:55] that beat again. We're one beat closer.
[1:03:58] And one of these days, we're coming up
[1:04:00] to that door. It's called death. And
[1:04:03] each one of us is going to meet it. And
[1:04:05] when I get there, I sure don't want to
[1:04:07] go in there like a coward.
[1:04:09] I want to go in there with my robes
[1:04:11] wrapped around me and his grace knowing
[1:04:15] this one thing that when he calls I'll
[1:04:17] come out of there someday.
[1:04:20] I said that's what I live for today is
[1:04:22] to do that to know him and to serve him.
[1:04:26] See I ask on when you when you examine
[1:04:29] and you look at your life where is he on
[1:04:32] your priority
[1:04:33] list? Where is where where where where
[1:04:36] is God when you go to think about it and
[1:04:38] say, "Lord, I where is he? Is he on the
[1:04:43] list?" Because that that's a that's a
[1:04:46] whole another question that I can't
[1:04:48] answer for you. I can't get you closer
[1:04:50] to God than you want to be with him. We
[1:04:54] can have Bible study every day, service
[1:04:56] every night. That don't mean that you
[1:04:58] going to grow closer to God. Amen. We
[1:05:01] can have prayer service every night and
[1:05:03] deliverance service. That don't mean
[1:05:05] that you going to grow closer to God.
[1:05:07] It's when you decide in your individual
[1:05:10] self, Lord, I want you to work in me.
[1:05:13] Lord, I want you to do something in my
[1:05:15] life. Lord, I want you to change my
[1:05:18] life. Lord, I want to completely
[1:05:20] surrender to you. Lord, I want you to
[1:05:22] put you first in everything. Lord, I
[1:05:24] want to make you the number one priority
[1:05:26] in my life. That's when things are
[1:05:28] changing your life. That's when things
[1:05:30] have become the best thing in your life.
[1:05:32] That's when that's when they talk about
[1:05:34] and said Jesus was the best thing that
[1:05:35] I've ever done. That's what they mean
[1:05:37] when they say that. Amen.
[1:05:40] Is when you set him as the number one
[1:05:42] priority. And you said, Lord, take
[1:05:44] complete control over my life. Lord, not
[1:05:47] my will but thy will be done. And Jesus
[1:05:51] had to come to that point. So do you and
[1:05:53] I. So do you and I. We have to come to
[1:05:55] him and say, "Lord, I want to put you as
[1:05:58] the number one priority in my life.
[1:06:01] Lord, I realize that my priority list
[1:06:03] has gotten changed up and mixed up and
[1:06:07] I've evaluated and put some things
[1:06:09] higher, but now today, today is my
[1:06:12] opportunity to make the best decision
[1:06:14] and make the best choice." Amen.
[1:06:17] Today is your opportunity this morning.
[1:06:20] Amen. Let us bow.
[1:06:26] Lord Jesus, we thank you for allowing us
[1:06:29] to come into your house. Lord, I want to
[1:06:32] ask you this morning, do you want to
[1:06:35] make him the number one priority in your
[1:06:37] life?
[1:06:39] If that's your desire this morning, li
[1:06:40] lift your hand this
[1:06:44] morning. Lord, I lift my hand to Lord. I
[1:06:47] want to grow closer to you each and
[1:06:48] every day. Lord, I ask that you'd
[1:06:51] continue to help each and every last one
[1:06:53] of us. And Lord, I ask that you'd move
[1:06:55] in this place, Lord. Meet every heart's
[1:06:57] desire this morning, Lord. And Lord, you
[1:07:00] see every hand and every need, Lord, you
[1:07:02] know what's going on in every life. And
[1:07:04] Lord, we ask that you move in such a
[1:07:06] mighty and a special way, Lord. Lord,
[1:07:09] those that need healing, those that need
[1:07:11] deliverance, Lord, we ask that you do it
[1:07:13] right now, Lord. those that want you and
[1:07:15] Lord and need salvation. Lord, we ask
[1:07:18] that you come in their heart, Lord
[1:07:19] Jesus, and save them right now. Lord,
[1:07:22] may you move in this place this morning.
[1:07:24] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
