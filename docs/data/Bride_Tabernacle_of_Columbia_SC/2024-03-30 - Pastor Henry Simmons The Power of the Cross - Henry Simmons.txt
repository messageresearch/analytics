lift your hand to the Lord and father we come to youu today knowing that you know all things Lord we ask you to continue to bless the pleas your children and those that have special needs special

died and father we realize that you live and father right now in Jesus name we ask you to bless every heart now in Jesus Christ's name amen book of First Corinthians 1 and 17 1 Corinthians 1 and 17 God is good you love the Lord praise God hallelujah I've been Thursday after Thursday folks down the mull shouting amen I said well we got to get the shouting up here everybody got to be like sister Dale amen let's get the shout up here amen we thank God Amen not that I want to make you shout but it's something about the name of Jesus ought to make you shout it says here for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom words least the Cross of Christ should be made a what none effect for we preach for the preaching of the what is to them that perish what foolishness but unto us which are what save it is the what power of God you may be seated we said that there's no substitute for certain things and there's no substitute for the preaching of the Cross when he said go and preach the gospel to Every Creature I believe he didn't say go preach Mysteries to Every Creature he said go preach the gospel to Every Creature isn't that right he that believeth in his baptized shall be what saved and these signs shall follow them that believe amen is the word of God the same today if it is the same then amen it ought to have the same effects are you with me it's the power of the Gospel amen nothing takes the place of the Gospel I don't care how many Mysteries you know nothing takes the place of the Gospel amen Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man can come to the father but by me are you with me the gospel amen he said the I said the power of the Cross amen the power of the Cross amen when the cross is not being preached the gospel is not being preached because it's on the cross it's at the cross where our first because if you don't see the cross you hadn't seen the light yet are you with me you might recognize that God called his people out of mystery of Babylon call them with the messenger and the message of the hour amen but that don't mean nothing if you don't see the cross praise God you said I came to the mess but did you come to Jesus did you see the power of the cross oh amen it's something about the cross fall you fall in love with Jesus because you see how much he cared about you to die for your sin if you don't see that then all is vain amen we might like people the church we might like amen uh the the the people in the church we might like the preacher but do you know that the power of the Gospel the power of the Cross and what the cross means to you and they said Easter but before Easter was the cross before the resurrection he had to die Amen Let me just read a little bit of this for it is written I will destroy the wi I will destroy the excuse me I will dest destroy the wisdom of the what wise people too smart because they too simple they don't want to believe this they think everything got to be mystified everything got to be on up there somewhere make you feel like you on a high somewhere amen but this is God hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same it's Jesus Christ amen what is the message it's the opening of the word are you with me this word must become more real to you than ever before this Bible amen through all the denomination of Creeds and dogmas of men the Bible becomes your absolute are you with me the Bible I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to what nothing to understanding of the prent a lot of smart people a lot of people that think they know something but to know him is life do you know Jesus do you really know Jesus to know him is life amen some people say you know they know about Jesus but do you know him I heard about him but do you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ has he come into your heart has he come into your life do you really know Jesus or do you it's an intellectual thought he said he that believeth on me as the scripture said then out of his belly shall flow what rivers of Living Water this word be got to become life to you you and the word must become one father make them one even as we are one at that day you know I'm in the Father the father me and I and you amen and you and me you got to be one we want to live on the outside but we want to declare that he's on the inside if he's on the inside your life must be a manifestation of him you're here to reproduce Jesus Christ in Bride form M Jesus Christ are you with me he says where is the wise where are the stries where is the disputers of this world has not God made what foolishness the wisdom of this world got so many smart people that gone off on this path that path all of them say we believe the same thing we believe the same Bible but yet you got aund I mean thousands of more than denominations and all and people believe this and that and all that but we got one God one Bible one Jesus one Lord One Faith one baptism ain't that right but everybody got their own thoughts about it amen one message but everybody got Thunders Two Souls all kind of stuff amen one one Jesus amen okay don't cut him up in parts just make it simple amen people want to elevate themselves above other people they want to push themselves up and make themselves something special you're already special if you're born again if you have the baptism the Holy Ghost you're special that mean God has signified that the blood has been applied to your life are you with me so you are special in the sight of God Amen so nobody's going to make you any more important or special to God because they are preaching something that high and mighty and make you think that your head and shoulders above everybody else time for all of that is over with people have taken flights and thinking that they were gone somewhere and then we see after a while those people didn't even have the simple principles of the love of God in their heart I remember brother came by me years ago and he was preaching all over the world and mighty preacher Mighty preacher and he was preaching all over the world he says brother Simmons you know I preach you got to have perfect love and I was busting up churches everywhere message churches he said but I preach perfect love and that you have to be sealed with the Holy Spirit see y'all see what I'm saying he said but brother I preached the Thunders you got to have them with all of that he said now I come back and with God in Simplicity you simple you got to have the love of God said I I got to I got to admit didn't have it didn't have it I'm G tell you something if somebody convince you to hate somebody or a down somebody and make you look like you high and mighty than something if that gospel that they preach to make you think hey you know that church over there and those people over there you y'all got it over here you better run for your life because what they trying to tell you they got something special you need them are you with me you need God we're not pointing you to us we're not pointing you to something it's pointing you to Jesus Christ it ought to make you want to love him more and love folks more are you with me if the gospel don't make you love God more and love one another more what is the gospel it's the love of God what is the Holy Ghost you ought to love God are you with me you ought to love your brothers and your sisters amen not te down not talk about them amen God I gotta quit I want to be short tonight the power of the Cross let me let me go back to Romans one the blood of Jesus should mean something the cross of Jesus should mean something the Passover the cross means the Passover the crossover are you with me and remember he said when I see the blood I what I pass over you amen and the blood of Jesus the cross means that when he sees the blood he'll pass over amen praise God the death angel couldn't come n your house are you with me because the blood has been applied to your life you know it's only there when you can receive Jesus Christ not as a thought not as something a figure of imagination but in reality something that sinks deep down in your heart Lord I I I want you in my life I want a I I want to know that you're there I don't want to just come to church and go through the motion I want to know you there God I want to know there something that anchored my soul I want to know oh God that the power of your Resurrection is and the fellowship of your suffering I want to know you God I know coming to Christ I wanted to know amen I I I wanted to know this God that I read about in the Bible I wanted to experience the things that I read read about in the Bible as a Believer I wanted to see amen God move in my life and I know he saved me and I know amen the things that I used to do I didn't do no more but I want more than that and sometime folks amen all they want is you Lord I just want to be saved but Lord you're saved you're saved for a purpose there a reason why God saved you you're saved for a purpose God wants to use you for certain purpose amen oh Hallelujah that's why he said let your light so shine that men should see your good what so God called you to do what work if you not work in your light it's going out somewhere along the line your lamps have gone out say if the salt has lost your savior where where shall it be salt are you with me if you don't have any season in it well you know you got to have something you got to be salty something that's going to draw somebody God I want to be able to let somebody else see Jesus is real see that Jesus amen that power in the name of Jesus God you done something for me you delivered me Lord you saved me amen I I got to have something that's real something that's different from all the other young people something that's different from the ne something that different from those that in the school God give me something give me something not in my soul that's real I need God something that makes a difference in my life praise God that I can hold on to praise God Amen I got to seee sometime I got to see some get up I got to see some Blind Eye Open I got to see some death airb Stu I'm not talking about the preacher I'm not talking about Mama Dad I'm talking about me God I got to see you move in my life I know you're real and God I

praise God I I want God the real Jesus to do what the Bible said the believer should do Lord I want it oh God the power of the cross it should reproduce little messes amen little Gods little am Gods little Jesus amen ought to be walking around amen praise God they call them Christians and I out because they was acting like Christ amen the anointing of power of God shall be upon your life praise God because the cross amen of God power it hasn't lost its effect just believing that Jesus died for our sins and that because of his blood amen because of his crucifixion and because of his dying amen my sins are forgiven and I can become amen a new creature in Christ I amen I can become a son a daughter of God because I believe praise God that Jesus died for my sins I can accept that fact but hey I go to church I hear all this High Mighty stuff yet I need Jesus I need I need that touch I need that reality I need something Amen to Anchor my faith just let me be a Christian amen I need something that's simple and plain I need I need God Amen all I can preach all Mysteries and have not charity it proit me nothing I can amen have faith that I can move mountains and have not it profit me nothing amen amen we can see through a glass Darkly amen praise God but I I want to see clearly amen for he said when that which is perfect is come that which is done away with amen praise God we talking about the prophet said in the 5th he said he said I'm talking about perfect love when perfect love come in the Holy Ghost is not amen just any kind of love it's God's love it's perfect amen and the love of God give you strength strength to do what to forgive your brother to forgive your enemy to love them that despitefully use you accuse you and abuse you we yet you forgive them you still holding it in your heart every time you bring it up again it's time to forgive because Christ what forgave you you forgive in spite of all this that's going on Lord I forgive you all right you feel all right you believe there's power in the cross somebody said was Jesus SP the cross alone and all the world go free no that's a cross for everyone and certainly that's a cross for me if there's

Jesus hallelujah amen amen hallelujah where would I be if he didn't sacrifice his life for me what would I be if he didn't care Brothers sister friend this world is fast going to com an the end time is winding up if you're going to go over there he says nothing but perfect love is going to go there nothing but perfect love you don't have perfect love you need to get it over here if you want to go over there beyond the curtains of [Music] time I don't know why he I don't know why he sacrificed his life oh but I'm glad so glad he did where would I be if Jesus didn't love me where would I be if he didn't care where would I be if he had sacrificed his life oh but I so glad he did he left his mighty throne in glory to bring to us Redemption [Music] story he died but he rose again just for you and me oh but I'm glad so glad he did where would I be if Jesus in where would I be if he didn't care where would I be if he had sacrifice his life oh but I so glad he did I don't know why Jesus loves me I don't know why oh he cares I don't know why oh he sacrific his life oh but I glad so glad he did he left his mighty Throne Mighty throne in glory to bring to us to bring to us Redemption story but then he died he died but he rose again just for you and me oh but I'm glad I'm glad over oh yes I'm glad I'm glad so glad he did for I receive of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner he also took the cup and when he had suck saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it and remember to me for as often as you eat this bread and drank this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the [Music] and sickly among you and many asleep you got to take it serious cuz people get sick people die because they take it unworthy so what happened to sister so so what happened to Brother s song didn't it didn't happen in denomination of church everybody just took it and went out and get them a drink after smoke a cigarette after but when it comes down to truth people do it things happen are you with me for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tear one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set an order when I come people can commit adultery they can lie to steal and cheat they can take communion why because that's the kind of church they go to you said what you talking about denomination I don't care if it's denomination I don't care if it's message people do that kind of stuff are they better off oh no they in worse shape because they supposed to know better are you with me it's a lie I'm not trying to scare you but it's a lie some people just miss communion they don't want to come because they just say well I miss it the Bible told Peter when he's talking about watching his feet Peter said you never wash my feet he said if I don't watch you amen you going you ain't going to have no problem with me amen what was communion about when Abraham met mzc are you with me the slaughter and what was the blood of the Passover all about he said when I see the blood I pass over you are you with me so we pring the cross we talking about Jesus cross when I see the cross was it important there the sacrifice of the lamb and Passover and so forth was it important then what about now people saying it ain't important I miss it I ain't coming you know what I'm saying you said communion ain't nobody wor to take it tell you you confess your sins the Bible say he's faithful in just to what forgive your sins and that right if you make an honest confession to God confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you are you with me but did you just go through the motions and not really repent God see that confession ain't real but if the confession is from the heart and is real God knows it are you with me so let us bow our heads if you got to talk it over with Jesus just say Lord Lord Jesus if there any is that anything in my life known or unknown to me that I've done that will make me unworthy to take communion God lord I want to acknowledge Lord I haven't been perfect oh God but I've made mistakes Lord and maybe Lord I said things i' Lord I've done things that maybe Lord God I shouldn't have father but Lord I ask you to forgive me Lord have mercy on me now for My Heart Lord I want to do better I want to live better I want to do right Lord I want to take advantage of the night Lord I want to start a new and a fresh with you Lord God I don't want to go down in water again but I come to communion Lord knowing that it's for the remission of our sins Lord forgiven us of our sin Lord Lord I pray you would bless every heart today as we oh God share with you how many of you brothers and sisters our heads about so Lord I want to lift my hand I want my conscience clear I want my life clean I want you to thank you Lord I want everything Lord I want to I I I I want a clean slate let the blood be applied forgive me Lord I want to take communion right amen the Lord that you might heal you might deliver God Lord help me get a fresh start in Jesus name amen you know they was getting ready to leave Egypt and that's why they took the Passover amen we're getting ready not to leave Egypt we're getting ready for the Third Exodus to get out of here brothers and sisters don't miss this Third Exodus God bless you than REM
