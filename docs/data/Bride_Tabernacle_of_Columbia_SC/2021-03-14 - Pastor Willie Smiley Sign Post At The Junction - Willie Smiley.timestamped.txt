[40:34] you to be seated and then we'll go to
[40:36] the book of uh
[40:38] luke when you have it say
[40:41] man uh acts chapter 2 we want to start
[40:45] with the first verse it says and when
[40:46] the day of pentecost was fully come
[40:49] they were with one accord in one place
[40:52] and suddenly there came a sound from
[40:54] heaven as of a russian
[40:56] mighty wind and it filled all the house
[40:59] where they were sitting and they
[41:01] appeared unto them clothing tongues
[41:03] like as a fire and it sat upon each of
[41:07] them and they were
[41:08] all filled with the holy ghost and began
[41:11] to speak
[41:12] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[41:14] them utterance
[41:15] and there were uh were dwelling at
[41:18] jerusalem jews devout men
[41:21] out of every nation under heaven now
[41:24] when this was known
[41:26] abroad the multitude came together and
[41:29] were
[41:30] confounded because that every man heard
[41:33] them speak
[41:34] in his own language and they were all
[41:37] amazed and ma was saying one to another
[41:41] behold are not all these which speak
[41:45] galileans and how here uh we every man
[41:48] in our own tongue
[41:50] when we were were born now let's maybe
[41:54] just skip down
[41:55] uh to the 12th verse and then it says
[41:57] and they were all amazed and were in
[42:00] doubt send one to another
[42:02] what meaneth this others mocking
[42:06] said these men are full of new wine
[42:09] but peter standing up with the 11 lifted
[42:12] up his voice
[42:13] and said unto them ye men of jerusalem
[42:17] and all you that dwell at uh
[42:21] men of judah and all you that dwell at
[42:23] jerusalem
[42:24] be this known unto you hearken to my
[42:28] words for these are not drunken as you
[42:31] suppose
[42:31] saying it is but the third hour of the
[42:35] day
[42:36] but this is that which was spoken by the
[42:38] prophet
[42:39] joel uh let's just buy our heads and i
[42:42] have you to be seated after prayer we'll
[42:44] read another scripture
[42:45] this morning gracious father we just
[42:47] thank you once again for this
[42:49] opportunity to be in the house of the
[42:51] lord this morning and uh
[42:54] we just pray that you could move the
[42:55] human part to one side that
[42:58] uh we could uh just share something that
[43:00] we we trust that'll be
[43:02] uh edifying this morning and uh when
[43:05] it's all said and done we'd be so
[43:07] careful to give you the praise the glory
[43:09] and the honor for all things this
[43:11] morning in jesus christ wonderful name
[43:14] amen you may be seated now we want to
[43:17] maybe look in the book of saint luke
[43:19] chapter 17
[43:20] and read a couple of verses out of there
[43:22] before we get started
[43:24] uh we want to start at the 26th verse
[43:26] and it says
[43:27] and as it were in the days of noah so
[43:30] shall it be
[43:31] uh in the days of the son of man they
[43:34] did eat they drank they married wives
[43:37] they were given in marriage until that
[43:38] day
[43:39] that noah entered into the ark and the
[43:42] flood came and destroyed them all
[43:45] likewise also it was in the days of lot
[43:48] they did eat they drank they bought they
[43:51] sold
[43:52] they it they build but uh the same day
[43:56] that a lot went out of sodomy rain
[43:58] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[44:00] destroyed them all
[44:02] even thus shall it be in the day when
[44:04] the son of man is revealed
[44:07] may the lord have a blessing to his word
[44:08] this morning we want to
[44:10] use as a little topic um this morning
[44:14] uh the signposts at the junction
[44:17] and um you know when you think about a
[44:20] junction
[44:21] i mean i quite sure a lot of us
[44:24] drive cars and sometimes you have to uh
[44:28] come to uh a stop sign and
[44:31] and when when you get there it really
[44:34] speaks of change
[44:36] it speaks of uh it brings you to a point
[44:39] where
[44:40] where you have to make a decision uh
[44:43] which direction you're going to go right
[44:46] you
[44:46] you just can't stay in one spot is that
[44:50] right
[44:51] amen you you got to make a decision
[44:53] whether i'm going straight
[44:54] whether i'm going to turn right whether
[44:56] i'm going to turn turn
[44:58] left but you it's you got to do
[45:01] something
[45:02] you you just can't remain in in that
[45:05] spot of people going to a man blow you
[45:08] off the uh
[45:09] stop sign you know because especially we
[45:12] we're living in an age where people are
[45:14] very very impatient
[45:16] right so so it really kind of speaks
[45:20] speaks of change uh we we read the book
[45:23] of acts this morning
[45:25] as as a just a foundational scripture
[45:28] uh and maybe we want to use as a little
[45:31] what mean if this uh one of the things i
[45:35] realized
[45:36] um we've been ministering quite a few
[45:38] years
[45:39] now uh uh and one of the things you you
[45:42] realize as a servant of god is that
[45:45] a lot of times things be happening
[45:49] spiritually right spiritually
[45:52] and scripturally and and and what what
[45:56] you find is
[45:57] is that people have no real clue of
[46:00] what's going on scripturally
[46:02] right people people you know i i found
[46:06] um where where people they go to church
[46:09] and we like to be excited
[46:11] and i enjoy being excited myself is that
[46:14] right i love
[46:15] i love good singing i love i love
[46:18] shouting i i like the emotional aspects
[46:22] of going to church
[46:23] but but i really i've realized something
[46:26] over the years in studying and
[46:29] ministering the word of god
[46:30] that that it's more to it than that
[46:35] because one of the things i realized we
[46:36] don't always feel good in the body
[46:40] right we in in our in our minds we don't
[46:43] always
[46:44] feel like jumping we don't always feel
[46:46] like shouting
[46:47] we don't always feel like running around
[46:50] and sometimes
[46:51] uh a sermon doesn't dictate
[46:54] that kind of atmosphere is that right
[46:58] but
[46:58] for me you you want to try to bring
[47:01] something that
[47:02] that stabilizes the people anchors of
[47:05] people
[47:06] and help the people to to really see
[47:09] what's going
[47:10] on around them is that right
[47:13] to me that's that's more important than
[47:15] a shout out
[47:16] because you can shout and be a hypocrite
[47:19] you can shout and be a devil is that
[47:22] right
[47:23] glory to god but i believe that that if
[47:26] if if you can get the people the word of
[47:28] god and
[47:29] anchor a man uh in their hearts
[47:33] that's the thing that'll bring about a
[47:34] chain
[47:36] is that right true true understanding
[47:39] right one of the things uh we've been
[47:41] taught is that revelation means more to
[47:44] us
[47:44] than anything is that right
[47:47] because without revelation you'll never
[47:50] even get the victory over the devil
[47:53] it's it's the revelation of the word of
[47:56] god that
[47:56] gives us the victory it's been the
[47:59] revelation
[48:00] amen of the word of god that has helped
[48:02] us in this season
[48:06] boy if it wasn't for revelation
[48:09] you know the scripture says we're living
[48:12] in a time in an
[48:13] hour where men's hearts will be failing
[48:16] them for fear
[48:18] right amen and and we could
[48:21] see with with everything that has gone
[48:24] on around us
[48:25] things that has taken place to bring
[48:28] about
[48:28] fear is that right
[48:32] amen but it's been the revelation of the
[48:36] word of god
[48:37] that has has anchored us here in the
[48:39] book of acts
[48:41] uh chapter two what what we find here
[48:44] is is that um um
[48:48] uh prophecy being fulfilled
[48:52] joel had prophesied
[48:55] this event that that the holy ghost
[48:59] not only that jesus when jesus
[49:03] actually came on the scene and
[49:06] and you know at the end part of his
[49:09] ministry
[49:10] with his disciples he said you know what
[49:13] uh in a little while the world won't see
[49:16] me no more
[49:19] but amen you see me for i'll be with you
[49:23] even in you right he he told them
[49:26] you know what i got to go away so that
[49:29] the comforter
[49:31] could come is that right
[49:35] you know that's important we people try
[49:37] to preach three guards if it was three
[49:38] guards in the godhead
[49:40] then jesus never really would have had
[49:42] to leave
[49:46] is that right why it's three of them the
[49:48] holy ghost
[49:49] a man would have just came and and and
[49:52] took his
[49:53] his his position but i mean it was just
[49:57] god changing his
[49:58] mask jesus says i got to go away
[50:03] that the comforter that
[50:06] christ could come amen and get in us
[50:10] and and do a work not
[50:13] not a no longer a one-man ministry
[50:16] but a a many member amen body
[50:21] is that right glory to his wonderful
[50:23] name now we can go in a lot of places
[50:25] there
[50:26] but but here um and i wanted to use this
[50:30] amen like i say because things can be
[50:32] going on around us
[50:34] and people don't have a clue
[50:38] people people kind of going on doing
[50:41] their thing
[50:42] living their own life their own these
[50:45] that you know
[50:46] their lifestyles and things of that
[50:48] nature with no
[50:49] clue scripturally
[50:53] i'll label on that for a second
[50:56] scripturally
[50:57] people don't have a clue amen
[51:01] what's going on scripture is being
[51:04] fulfilled
[51:05] and people just religious right
[51:08] people people just religious people
[51:11] going to church
[51:12] as tradition and things of that nature
[51:15] with no clear
[51:16] understanding that the prophecies of the
[51:19] scriptures is being fulfilled
[51:22] now here's joelle being a prophet
[51:24] because he
[51:25] amen amen he said surely i don't do
[51:27] nothing
[51:29] except i reveal it to my servants the
[51:31] prophets
[51:32] god anoints a man a man becomes the
[51:36] voice of god to the people
[51:38] he speaks he speaks a word
[51:42] amen in the name of god
[51:45] not his own agenda not his own thing
[51:48] he's be
[51:48] just the voice of god to the people
[51:51] because you know
[51:52] uh one time god spoke to the church and
[51:54] they said no no
[51:55] no no no no no no we don't want him to
[51:58] speak no more
[51:59] they came up to mount sinai he told
[52:02] moses to gather the people and
[52:04] he wanted to talk to him and he
[52:06] thundered down on the
[52:08] on the mountain and everything and it
[52:09] was like wait a minute it's just too
[52:11] much to handle
[52:14] is that right but the sovereignty of god
[52:16] said okay we'll i'll do it like this
[52:19] i'll use a man
[52:20] man has always been god's agent is that
[52:23] right
[52:24] and so god anoints amen um
[52:27] uh amos amen to speak a word of
[52:31] prophecy right
[52:35] amen and and here what we find is
[52:39] is that the prophecy i mean joel y'all
[52:42] forgive me on that one
[52:43] joel joel spoke concerning amen
[52:48] uh this event is that right
[52:52] and so uh uh at at a point
[52:56] jesus shut the ministry down and told
[52:58] him to go to amen
[53:00] uh to jerusalem and wait
[53:04] is that right tarry there you know
[53:07] no not not kind of like they teach it
[53:11] uh in in pentecost not not
[53:14] just being trying to be different but
[53:16] you know just to bring clarity
[53:19] i remember i remember just before i got
[53:22] saved i was kind of out in the world
[53:24] doing my thing on drugs and everything
[53:26] and uh
[53:27] but i was i was was going through some
[53:29] serious challenges and then
[53:31] i needed god and god directed me to this
[53:35] uh pentecostal church and not just to be
[53:38] critical
[53:39] so you know i want to say that but you
[53:41] know uh
[53:42] you don't want to lack understanding in
[53:44] this hour
[53:46] right uh uh one of the jobs of the holy
[53:49] ghost is to lead you and guide you into
[53:51] all truth and to show you things which
[53:53] are to come
[53:55] and so they had me i went in and they
[53:58] had me down on the altar
[54:00] some of y'all know what i'm talking
[54:01] about and those those those women and
[54:04] men they had me down there just calling
[54:06] on him call on him baby
[54:08] call on them jesus jesus jesus jesus
[54:11] jesus
[54:12] jesus jesus jesus brother brother
[54:14] simmons probably know what i'm talking
[54:16] about
[54:16] he'll he's he's a little older so maybe
[54:19] our young folks don't know nothing about
[54:21] that
[54:22] but they would hit me on the back and i
[54:24] was calling on them but it was just
[54:26] something about it when i got up i
[54:27] realized
[54:28] i hadn't been changed i had i hadn't
[54:32] been changed in the scripture
[54:34] just said wait they didn't have to do
[54:36] anything
[54:37] right because it was a promise they just
[54:39] they just they just had to
[54:41] be patient and wait on god to come on
[54:43] the scene and do something is that right
[54:45] they didn't have to they didn't have to
[54:47] jesus jesus
[54:48] jesus they all they had to do is just
[54:51] stay there and
[54:52] wait for the fulfillment
[54:55] right of of the prophecy
[54:58] glory to his wonderful name so you can
[55:01] you can
[55:02] beat people maybe sometimes we ought to
[55:04] because it seemed like
[55:05] folk got more results back then
[55:09] almost than what we get now with all of
[55:12] the fullness of the word
[55:14] come on y'all y'all know me come on
[55:17] let's pull on the word of god how many
[55:19] had church vote
[55:20] up in here y'all don't work me too hard
[55:23] my god if if you understand it just say
[55:26] man
[55:27] i'm not gonna hurt you i ain't gonna be
[55:29] long neither
[55:32] uh but but um you know what what was
[55:35] happening
[55:36] was was was scripture being fulfilled
[55:40] prophecy of the scripture being
[55:43] fulfilled
[55:44] and and after these guys was filled
[55:47] man a bunch of a bunch of cowards that
[55:49] was locked up in a room
[55:51] scared of the councils and things of
[55:53] that nature
[55:54] now amen uh uh they
[55:58] they they come out they were anointed
[56:01] right
[56:02] they were they were equipped
[56:05] is that right because because there was
[56:07] a point
[56:08] where jesus shut him down he says peter
[56:11] when when you get converted
[56:14] right then you strengthen the brethren
[56:15] [Applause]
[56:17] he said you know after after the holy
[56:20] ghost come upon you you'll receive
[56:23] power right these guys when the holy
[56:27] ghost they had
[56:28] power to be a witness you can't witness
[56:31] christ without the power of the holy
[56:34] ghost in your life
[56:36] it's just intellectual
[56:39] is that right amen the gospel has got to
[56:43] be
[56:43] demonstrated people want to see
[56:46] god in action
[56:50] they saw god in action
[56:53] right they they you know they they heard
[56:56] the brethren was speaking in tongues and
[56:58] they were hearing and they
[57:00] they was watching you know uh the
[57:02] supernatural taking place
[57:05] things that was happening probably
[57:08] beyond anything that they had been
[57:11] taught
[57:12] come on y'all right anything that they
[57:15] would talk
[57:15] god does things beyond
[57:19] our intellectual thinking a lot of times
[57:21] god does
[57:22] things scripturally amen beyond
[57:26] the way sometimes we've been even taught
[57:29] sometimes even beyond theological
[57:32] perspectives
[57:35] right glory to god amen this was beyond
[57:38] theology
[57:41] right this this was the prophecy of the
[57:44] scripture being fulfilled
[57:47] and and and you know no doubt it was
[57:50] religious people in the crowd
[57:52] come on church folk way in the crowd
[57:55] probably
[57:56] dignitaries potent takes and everything
[57:59] in the crowd
[58:00] probably learned it men in the crowd
[58:04] scripturally probably men that had read
[58:06] them
[58:07] read the uh torah but but
[58:10] they they stood around and they said my
[58:13] looking at one another
[58:17] like but it's been this something that's
[58:20] beyond
[58:21] anything that that we've been taught
[58:24] right what they they they looked around
[58:27] and they had to ask
[58:28] ask themselves the question what mean if
[58:31] this
[58:34] right they had they had no understanding
[58:37] nobody in the crowd could interpret it
[58:40] for them
[58:42] right nobody around them
[58:46] a man could interpret it for him
[58:49] but amen uh peter
[58:54] right because the scripture says peter
[58:57] peter stood up
[58:58] because they they were saying you know
[58:59] what man these men
[59:02] drunk they had part truth
[59:06] right they had part two because they
[59:08] wasn't drunk but like peter said
[59:10] we ain't drunk like y'all suppose
[59:14] it's a little bit too early
[59:18] you know sometimes you know you get up
[59:20] early in the morning you're going on
[59:21] your way to work and you're going a
[59:23] little slow you're getting a little gas
[59:24] little coffee and sometimes you look
[59:27] over i look over and i'll be like
[59:29] it is 30 8 o'clock man you got a six
[59:33] pack already in your hand
[59:36] they ain't folk ain't he ate breakfast
[59:38] yet
[59:40] but peter says you know what this this
[59:44] this what's going on it's it's the
[59:47] fulfillment
[59:49] of of prophecy
[59:53] god anointed a man he spoke it now
[59:56] amen this is being fulfilled
[1:00:00] they had no clear-cut understanding
[1:00:03] about what was going on
[1:00:06] is that right but amen peter had the
[1:00:10] keys to the kingdom
[1:00:12] and it took it took peter amen to take
[1:00:15] the key and open the amen
[1:00:18] uh uh the door to the kingdom up to
[1:00:21] uh uh the predestinated
[1:00:25] because we we know that uh 3 000 men
[1:00:28] you know after peter got finished
[1:00:30] preaching they said man and brother
[1:00:32] what must we do to be saved
[1:00:35] but here's the thing uh why i wanted to
[1:00:39] draw our attention to that
[1:00:40] that scripturally things can be going on
[1:00:44] around us and and folk don't have
[1:00:47] no clear-cut understanding
[1:00:50] we we you know kind of
[1:00:54] go around like what mean is this and we
[1:00:56] we have
[1:00:57] all we have all of these questions but
[1:01:00] one of the things i realized
[1:01:02] amen if there's a bible question there's
[1:01:04] a bible answer
[1:01:08] see and and i thank god that the the
[1:01:11] ministry
[1:01:13] has taught us to follow
[1:01:16] scriptural prophecy
[1:01:19] right glory to god see that
[1:01:22] that i i want to say something church
[1:01:25] that's the only
[1:01:26] way that that will make it in this
[1:01:29] hour is is
[1:01:33] following the prophecies of the
[1:01:36] scriptures
[1:01:38] see when we follow the prophecies of the
[1:01:42] scripture and the promises of the word
[1:01:44] of god
[1:01:45] it takes away the fear
[1:01:50] come on because i i i know
[1:01:53] with with coving and everything who
[1:01:55] would ever thought
[1:01:57] not not now take this for what it is and
[1:02:00] i'm
[1:02:00] i'm not criticizing because uh at church
[1:02:04] we in church we got masks on too
[1:02:07] who would have ever thought that a year
[1:02:11] ago
[1:02:13] huh who who would have ever thought that
[1:02:17] right none of us i remember you know
[1:02:20] maybe a few years back
[1:02:21] you know you'll catch a glimpse of the
[1:02:23] news and and and
[1:02:24] you you'll see the chinese walking
[1:02:26] around with with mask on
[1:02:29] around the community now all over the
[1:02:32] entire world amen
[1:02:36] uh we we're we got mass not now hear me
[1:02:39] good
[1:02:40] cause i don't want to say that brother
[1:02:42] can't wait up here
[1:02:44] to get on us about our mass i'm all
[1:02:46] right with people wearing masks
[1:02:48] i wear a mask that's not what i'm saying
[1:02:52] but but but i'm going somewhere with
[1:02:54] that that thought
[1:02:56] right we thank god that god god
[1:03:00] gave us insight
[1:03:04] by prophecy by a seventh angel to show
[1:03:09] us that
[1:03:10] things was gonna come on the earth
[1:03:13] and how that men had broken uh see all
[1:03:17] this
[1:03:17] is these modern events is being made
[1:03:20] clear
[1:03:20] by prophecy right
[1:03:24] germ warfare was pathetically spoken
[1:03:29] and we probably sat around and we we
[1:03:31] would read different things and be like
[1:03:34] what
[1:03:37] and then when when things drop
[1:03:40] we was just like they were in acts 2.
[1:03:42] what mean is this what do you mean what
[1:03:44] mean is this
[1:03:46] we had we had the prophecy
[1:03:51] it had already been spoken
[1:03:54] we've quoted it we've preached it is
[1:03:57] that right
[1:03:59] and when it happened we were just like
[1:04:02] the brethren in the book of acts what
[1:04:03] mean if this
[1:04:04] oh my god covet
[1:04:10] and we almost allowed covet
[1:04:13] a man to dictate our every move
[1:04:17] to bring fear you know you know what i
[1:04:21] feel is ironic
[1:04:22] is we got enough faith to go to work
[1:04:27] with covey in the air but we ain't got
[1:04:30] enough faith harley to come to church
[1:04:32] with cove
[1:04:35] come on now come on now
[1:04:39] well i don't know pastor what do you
[1:04:42] mean
[1:04:43] you know when it's time to get up and go
[1:04:45] get that paycheck don't you
[1:04:48] the same faith it takes to go to work
[1:04:51] with it
[1:04:52] to go to walmart to go to the restaurant
[1:04:55] to go shop we could do everything now
[1:04:58] i'm gonna
[1:04:59] say this now all right i ain't gonna
[1:05:01] take this back i'm
[1:05:02] gonna let this fly we got
[1:05:06] faith enough to do all kind of things
[1:05:08] but folk ain't holly got
[1:05:09] faith enough to go to church i know even
[1:05:13] in florida
[1:05:14] uh it's it's churches that ain't even
[1:05:17] you know
[1:05:17] uh uh open up
[1:05:21] because of the fear
[1:05:24] not realizing we got a scriptural
[1:05:26] promise
[1:05:29] he said he heals all diseases
[1:05:32] is that right we
[1:05:35] sometimes i think we forget amen that he
[1:05:38] shed blood
[1:05:41] is that right glory to god but we got

[1:08:35] has been amen condensed down into this
[1:08:38] age every spirit
[1:08:42] every kind of demon everything that's
[1:08:45] been turned
[1:08:46] loose
[1:08:49] right but it's these
[1:08:52] things is only a signpost
[1:08:57] right you know the scripture says when
[1:08:59] you start seeing these things to look up
[1:09:03] see it's when when we see
[1:09:07] see and this is why we read um um luke
[1:09:10] 17

[1:10:14] see amen but by studying you understand
[1:10:18] you know what in the age that i'm living
[1:10:20] in there's there's a spirit that
[1:10:22] in you know this layout of cnas that
[1:10:26] that we're fighting
[1:10:28] the enemy is fighting marriages like
[1:10:30] never before
[1:10:32] preachers marriages deacons marriages
[1:10:35] and
[1:10:35] and everybody else marriage it's a
[1:10:38] spirit
[1:10:40] that's trying to bust up families
[1:10:44] is that right to break the oneness in
[1:10:48] the home
[1:10:49] to spirits trying to break the oneness
[1:10:51] in the church
[1:10:54] oh you come on now
[1:10:58] what's then is now we could look
[1:11:01] back amen to genesis in the garden of
[1:11:04] eden
[1:11:05] right the the first church
[1:11:08] amen glory to god the first church with
[1:11:11] adam and eve
[1:11:13] the first family the first represent
[1:11:17] representation of of of the mind of god
[1:11:24] and and and what we we we find is
[1:11:28] is that the enemy right satan comes into
[1:11:32] the church
[1:11:34] satan comes into the home
[1:11:37] right glory to god he he anoints the
[1:11:41] woman
[1:11:42] the weaker vessel come on
[1:11:46] i know y'all strong black women
[1:11:52] you you you could be strong and be
[1:11:54] dainty too
[1:11:55] you ain't got to be a pushover but you
[1:11:58] just got to know your place
[1:12:01] when when when he fell because
[1:12:04] a man uh uh she lost the perspective of
[1:12:09] her role
[1:12:13] if if when the serpent came she would
[1:12:15] have went to
[1:12:16] adam initially i'm gonna
[1:12:19] i'm gonna dwell on this for a second and
[1:12:21] i'm gonna move on one of the things i
[1:12:23] find
[1:12:23] like i say i've passed to the church for
[1:12:25] 23 years
[1:12:27] and one of the things i found was that
[1:12:30] um um people when the enemy comes they
[1:12:34] don't come to the pastor
[1:12:37] right sometimes sometimes we fail to
[1:12:40] realize that
[1:12:42] you know the pastor is is is the
[1:12:45] watchman
[1:12:46] he's the shepherd he's he's he's the
[1:12:49] the the god of the sheep
[1:12:52] he's the door i mean right
[1:12:55] he he's multifunctional
[1:13:00] but we we we try to do things because a
[1:13:02] lot of times folk think that they got
[1:13:04] most sense and that they smarter
[1:13:07] than the pastor you not intellectually a
[1:13:11] lot of times you might be
[1:13:13] but spiritually he's anointed the
[1:13:18] the prophet said that he's ordained the
[1:13:21] legion
[1:13:25] he's ordained if he's a god-called man
[1:13:28] he's ordained to lead you through
[1:13:33] glory to god he's just not just not some
[1:13:36] fixture right
[1:13:39] no he's gifted
[1:13:44] a lot of times you know i found in in
[1:13:46] the past they come
[1:13:48] you know uh uh brother smiley
[1:13:51] uh um you know i stuttered it out really
[1:13:56] you did what was the conclusion you came
[1:13:59] up with
[1:14:01] well and you just be sitting back there
[1:14:05] yeah you so far off the word it's it's
[1:14:07] not funny
[1:14:09] is that right then amen you could see it
[1:14:13] when they come from under the umbrella
[1:14:15] of the word of god you give them six
[1:14:17] months life wrecked up families tore up
[1:14:22] is that right amen listen
[1:14:25] listen god you know what you're here
[1:14:28] because god
[1:14:29] placed you here
[1:14:32] you got you got to know that brother
[1:14:35] simmons is your
[1:14:36] your pastor is that right
[1:14:39] amen glory to god you that's something
[1:14:42] that amen
[1:14:43] that's got to be revealed just like the
[1:14:46] new birth has got to be a revelation to
[1:14:48] you
[1:14:48] amen your pastor has got to be a
[1:14:51] revelation
[1:14:53] is that right amen and when when that's
[1:14:56] the case
[1:14:57] you know when he do things that maybe
[1:14:59] you don't
[1:15:00] like you don't go
[1:15:03] running off somewhere y'all gotta talk
[1:15:06] to me
[1:15:08] now i've been pastored i pastored for 23
[1:15:10] years i'm not pastoring it anymore but i
[1:15:12] passed it for 23 years so
[1:15:14] amen i'm not going to approach it
[1:15:16] evangelistical
[1:15:18] i'm multi talented
[1:15:23] right we got insight
[1:15:26] see if people do things come god's
[1:15:28] provided way
[1:15:30] people people come to junctions
[1:15:34] right and and don't know which way to
[1:15:36] turn
[1:15:38] they turn away from amen the scripture
[1:15:42] because when you turn away from the
[1:15:44] shepherd you turn away from the
[1:15:46] scripture
[1:15:48] because god's got a provided way come on
[1:15:51] y'all
[1:15:52] god's got a provided way glory to god
[1:15:56] amen the devil is slime slick
[1:16:02] when he went to eve he was smooth
[1:16:06] when he got to talking to eve he was
[1:16:08] smooth
[1:16:10] oh girl you won't fully surely die
[1:16:13] come on now i know that pastor adam told
[1:16:17] you that but
[1:16:18] listen let me let me drop something on
[1:16:22] you that
[1:16:22] that you know adam didn't tell you
[1:16:26] amen god listen god know the day that
[1:16:28] you eat from this tree
[1:16:30] you'll be wise you'll be smart you'll
[1:16:33] know man you're no good for me
[1:16:35] what and adam didn't tell me that
[1:16:39] no i didn't tell you that because that
[1:16:41] was death
[1:16:43] to eat from that tree he told you don't
[1:16:46] do it
[1:16:48] don't partake of it is that right
[1:16:53] god gives us revelation when it's needed
[1:16:58] right amen but amen she didn't come god
[1:17:02] provided weight she didn't go to a
[1:17:05] husband
[1:17:06] her thinking changed from the original
[1:17:08] revelation of the word of god
[1:17:12] that's why the church is in the
[1:17:14] condition that it's in
[1:17:16] and that's why we needed a mouthpiece in
[1:17:18] this hour
[1:17:20] to bring us back to the bible
[1:17:27] i thank god god sent us an angel
[1:17:32] glory to god and that angel couldn't
[1:17:34] come unless there was scripture
[1:17:36] to bring him
[1:17:39] is that right oh glory to god malachi
[1:17:43] 4 luke 17 30 revelation
[1:17:46] 10 7
[1:17:50] right glory to god
[1:17:53] right why be because people
[1:17:56] turn from the word and brought a man
[1:18:00] their own way of thinking
[1:18:04] eve eve thinking changed
[1:18:08] right and when her thinking changed she
[1:18:10] no longer believe the message
[1:18:14] come on she know she and
[1:18:17] and and and when she didn't believe the
[1:18:20] message
[1:18:21] look at the damage that it caused
[1:18:24] it broke up adam never argued with eve
[1:18:29] until her thinking changed
[1:18:32] right why they were in a witness
[1:18:36] they were in an order there was that was
[1:18:39] a respect
[1:18:41] that was a love is that right glory to
[1:18:44] god
[1:18:45] but that was broken the fellowship was
[1:18:48] broken
[1:18:49] the fellowship with god was broken
[1:18:54] glory to god god come down
[1:18:59] you know it wasn't like he didn't know
[1:19:01] where adam was that wasn't even it
[1:19:04] but he realized you know what adam
[1:19:06] revelation had changed
[1:19:09] huh adam
[1:19:14] adam well yeah
[1:19:17] well you really want to know him over
[1:19:20] here in these bushes
[1:19:21] what are you doing over there
[1:19:25] um huh
[1:19:29] well i i'm
[1:19:33] naked where will you get that revelation
[1:19:35] from
[1:19:39] there was a spiritual veil over adam's
[1:19:42] eyes
[1:19:44] where where where him and eve could walk
[1:19:47] amen in the garden
[1:19:49] didn't even realize
[1:19:53] right but when that perspective to the
[1:19:56] message
[1:19:57] changed right
[1:20:00] amen they their eyes came open then
[1:20:04] now they're like wait a minute something
[1:20:06] changed here
[1:20:09] instantly adam tried to do something
[1:20:11] within himself
[1:20:13] right he tried to put work into
[1:20:17] sawing a fig leaf uh apron around
[1:20:21] you know i mean he tried to put in work
[1:20:25] his own way of thinking right
[1:20:29] amen he forfeited the abstract title
[1:20:31] deed
[1:20:34] is that right see when he when he had
[1:20:37] the abstract title deed
[1:20:39] he could name he could speak he could
[1:20:42] say
[1:20:43] he was amen the god of the earth
[1:20:46] he was given dominion now he
[1:20:49] forfeited it for amen each revelation
[1:20:55] like lord eve what you did
[1:21:00] glory to god he loved him
[1:21:04] he loved him i mean
[1:21:07] he crossed over the word of god right
[1:21:11] he stepped over the chasm and then had
[1:21:13] no way back on his own
[1:21:16] come on right
[1:21:20] i know no folks think well he took even
[1:21:24] you know look adam adam once adam fell
[1:21:27] adam could not redeem eve
[1:21:32] adam needed redeeming himself now
[1:21:38] he tried to figure it out with the fig
[1:21:41] leaves trying to all make a denomination
[1:21:44] didn't work amen he knew
[1:21:48] he knew that when god came down there
[1:21:50] was something
[1:21:51] in him like this is not going to be
[1:21:53] accepted by god
[1:21:57] is that right this is not going to be
[1:21:59] accepted by god
[1:22:01] no denomination is accepted by god
[1:22:06] because it's not amen in the principles
[1:22:09] of the word
[1:22:12] right god never created
[1:22:17] right not one denomination come on
[1:22:20] preach with me
[1:22:23] all that amen god knew it would be
[1:22:27] but it it was all outside of the realms
[1:22:31] of the word of god
[1:22:33] right amen that's why we needed a voice
[1:22:37] to bring us back to the bible
[1:22:41] glory to god because because when you
[1:22:44] create these things then you
[1:22:46] you got men and and and emotions
[1:22:49] and feelings and you get a lot of
[1:22:51] nonsense
[1:22:53] hockeys and and all of that kind of
[1:22:56] stuff
[1:22:57] right glory to god
[1:23:00] god's when god's provided way is amen
[1:23:04] under the new testament church he placed
[1:23:06] a fivefold ministry there
[1:23:09] right amen the shepherds and
[1:23:12] you know the prophet the evangelists the
[1:23:15] teachers and all of that
[1:23:16] but amen all of them are under the
[1:23:18] umbrellas of the holy ghost
[1:23:21] the leader of the holy ghost right
[1:23:25] amen the mouthpiece of god they speak
[1:23:28] for god
[1:23:30] is that right glory to god it ain't
[1:23:33] about it ain't about
[1:23:34] me being you know a bigger man than
[1:23:38] brother simmons that's nonsense
[1:23:41] right because because a real great man
[1:23:44] will make another man
[1:23:46] feel like he's the big man
[1:23:48] [Music]
[1:23:49] come on glory to god
[1:23:54] glory to god sometimes you go to
[1:23:55] meetings and it's like i just sit back
[1:23:57] and just like whatever
[1:24:02] you know y'all y'all might feel like
[1:24:03] y'all bigger and and no more than
[1:24:05] brother smiley and you might
[1:24:07] i'm fine with that but one thing i do
[1:24:10] know
[1:24:11] when when i get this microphone in my
[1:24:13] hand and i get smiley out of the way
[1:24:16] god can preach god
[1:24:19] can't i ain't much of a preacher but god
[1:24:22] can preach
[1:24:25] right but but
[1:24:29] eve had to make a choice one of the
[1:24:32] things that they didn't understand
[1:24:34] oh my god it's almost 12 o'clock
[1:24:40] oh i don't gotta anoint it jesus
[1:24:46] y'all giving about 15 more i got 15
[1:24:48] minutes in me
[1:24:52] but the thing but the thing that they
[1:24:54] didn't understand
[1:24:56] amen in acts chapter 2
[1:24:59] they were at a junction
[1:25:02] right and they had to make to make
[1:25:04] decisions
[1:25:05] right because they was they was coming
[1:25:08] from under the law and going into grace
[1:25:13] if they were they were they were at a a
[1:25:16] a point where where you're going to
[1:25:19] either go
[1:25:20] forward with present-day
[1:25:24] light right or stay in darkness
[1:25:29] right see if if you
[1:25:32] if you want to be fed watch this
[1:25:37] amen you got to constantly move with god
[1:25:41] see god fed the prophet
[1:25:44] by the brook sheriff he sustained them
[1:25:48] there
[1:25:50] but but the prophet came to a junction
[1:25:55] right and god says listen
[1:25:58] now now you can stay there and die
[1:26:01] come on
[1:26:04] oh you can go over here i got a woman
[1:26:07] over
[1:26:08] there she may not know it yet
[1:26:13] but i got a woman over there amen
[1:26:16] with something that will sustain you
[1:26:22] and when when the prophet got there you
[1:26:24] know that that day
[1:26:26] and and and he he met the woman and she
[1:26:28] was getting ready to you know
[1:26:30] make a last look uh uh uh a
[1:26:33] cake and and all that and in her mind
[1:26:36] you know she said well we remember
[1:26:38] somebody he'll eat this and you know
[1:26:40] whatever happened and that's it that's a
[1:26:42] wrap
[1:26:44] a bit of famine in the land and about
[1:26:46] like it is now
[1:26:50] but thank god for predestination
[1:26:54] is that right thank god for
[1:26:57] predestination
[1:26:59] amen god god sent her a man a prophet
[1:27:04] huh amen god sent her a prophet

[1:27:51] just enough you know to make a little
[1:27:54] cake

[1:28:31] think about i
[1:28:32] you know one day i was preaching kind of
[1:28:34] on these lines and i started
[1:28:35] thinking about you know um the raven and
[1:28:39] the nature you got to think about some
[1:28:41] things sometimes
[1:28:42] how supernatural that was now i don't
[1:28:44] really know whether it was
[1:28:45] cooked or not cooked it don't matter
[1:28:48] because i believe he was able to build a
[1:28:49] fine cook
[1:28:51] right but to think the nature
[1:28:54] of a wild animal like that would
[1:28:58] would be to devour
[1:29:02] come on a raven
[1:29:06] it's like boy i can imagine being
[1:29:08] selfish
[1:29:11] like well it got me something to eat
[1:29:12] well no
[1:29:15] but god placed it in the raven
[1:29:20] don't you eat that
[1:29:23] yeah the supernatural god is a
[1:29:26] supernatural god
[1:29:28] take that to the man of god
[1:29:32] oh i started thinking about that one day
[1:29:34] i'm like
[1:29:35] you that's a powerful thought to think
[1:29:39] the nature of that the raven right
[1:29:42] and that that that he will be submissive
[1:29:45] come on now
[1:29:47] oh glory to god look we we supposed to
[1:29:50] lord i feel something now we supposed to
[1:29:54] be
[1:29:54] the highest life form that god made
[1:29:59] the highest form of intelligence is man
[1:30:07] and we're more disobedient than animals
[1:30:09] sometimes
[1:30:12] [Applause]
[1:30:15] you could train dogs to roll over junk
[1:30:17] to sit and stay
[1:30:19] or whatever sometimes you you can't seem
[1:30:22] like you can't get nothing involved
[1:30:25] right
[1:30:28] we got more work than we've ever had
[1:30:31] i'm just saying this right i don't know
[1:30:34] i don't really know y'all i know y'all
[1:30:36] but i don't know you because i don't
[1:30:37] live here

[1:30:42] brother brother simmers know y'all
[1:30:44] i don't really know y'all i know you but
[1:30:45] i don't know yet
[1:30:47] i ain't passing you right
[1:30:50] but sometimes you you find now nowadays
[1:30:53] especially with all of the word and
[1:30:55] intelligence and education we're less
[1:30:58] submissive
[1:31:01] come on we're less submissive to
[1:31:04] authority
[1:31:05] children less submissive to depend well
[1:31:08] i'm smarter than them
[1:31:10] but you dumber than them you
[1:31:13] intellectually most smart right
[1:31:18] but you do things that they wouldn't do

[1:31:57] meaning behind it
