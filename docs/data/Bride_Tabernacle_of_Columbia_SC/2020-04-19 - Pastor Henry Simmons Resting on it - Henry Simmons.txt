infirmities of this world in this life in the flesh God will be with us in our infirmities we said many of the fliction of the righteous but the Lord shall deliver them out of them all amen we can trust God even now Hebrews 6 and 13 it says for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no bread oh he sware up by himself saying surely I would bless thee and multiply blind I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endure he attained the promise for men valid swear by the greater and an oath of confirmation is to them an inn of all strife when God willing more upon the that is shown to the years of promise the immutability of his cancer confirmed it with a nova that by two immutable things which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuse to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which in turn until that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us in earth even Jesus made in high priest forever after the order of melchizedek God bless the reduce word amen we have a more sure word of prophecy we want to talk to you this morning about we're resting on it I said rest on it amen so topic an ankle of the soul an ankle of the soul my soul has been anchored an ankle of the soul God ankles our soul as I was praying and thinking that they meant in the storms of life we need an anchor that will hold [Music] when the storms of life are read Whitney an ankle servant of God says why he was somewhat caught up in the curtains me beyond the curtains of time looked over there and he saw sinks that have made it over when he saw them that made it although he began to greet them and he said that beyond the cogs of time he was greeted and welcomed but said it was not the judgment time and it was not heaven but it was in the sixth dimension and in that sixth dimension there not as of yet crossed over into the seventh they had not been raptured as a yet but they were in a place where they were rested and we have come to a place where you and I can rush I heard you all when he looked he was going through his trouble time he said about his life it's better for me if I not been born bat him for me my mother wouldn't concede you go to trouble he said there they start looking at the dynamics of life and travel that you have to go through and he said that didn't uh these times he said that there the weary cease from troubling a meant and not that would be a place that they would rest when he was talking about degrees he was talking about a place he meant they meant that he looked at life that he said that they meant to a place that I can rush well that could rest but praise God I want to talk about an anchor to the soul I believe Paul was contemplating and he was looking at it and he was saying in Hebrews here that he was looking at and he says saying for God made a promise to Abraham and God promises something and that promise that God made it him they gave him hope and that hope was to ankle his soul that promise that God made him he meant it was sure it was that fact it was something to anchor his soul I believe God made us a promise something to anchor our soul in and I believe it's a haven of rest I believe that we can rest in hope and the Bible said hope make is that's not a shame they meant when he talked about the Holy Ghost she said why the hope maketh not a say I said oh ankle for the Soul is our hope he met God even gives us hope the wild don't have any hope but we have hope that God made us a promise and that hope ankles also but beyond the courage of time when sinks were in it probably the garbage talking to the sinks that's going beyond the curtains of time hard them see he meant the charge meant has to come and you gonna be gathered with your people and they said to him he said what Paul be judged for what he preached they said Paul would be gathered with his people and he'll be charged he said well if I preach what power preach they meant and it said we're resting on it because I got to preach what power preach and if I preach what power preach you can rest on him I said if I preach what Paul preached you can rest on it for Paul said though we on AIDS or come from heaven pretending out the gospel than that which we preach he said let him be a curse amen well rested on the same gospel he said I wanted to speak the same thing I got to be known among to the same the women will keep silence in the church what power preach you're preach Jesus Christ preached for power preach themselves with knives appearance what she placed it a surprise hey you pick what power preach oh yes you got two priests what Paul be quiet spirit well if you preach

gotta be according to his word somebody said well I'll get a gospel that please me hey they want a gospel let's go please them they don't want to please God that's why people they met Rasta the scriptures to their own destruction because they dress it up to please themselves let's just set the please God not ourselves let's realize that it's holiness to God calling for they met where's that good old time the gospel he meant that the preacher didn't mind telling you the truth him the preachers stood for Santi amen we got to preach like palm reached it Paul preaches so much today what it

this but there somnus shot and glory it may be here on the curtains of time we're resting on praise God does both of God in line with the word and they arrested in the book of 1st Thessalonians 4 where we went last week I want you to look with me again 1st Thessalonians 4 amen god is good and I want you to notice here that they were resting they were beyond the curtains of time and it's a resting place they meant that you and I can find rest for the weary rest of our soul they meant Jesus they're coming to me all you to leave and heavy laden and I'll give you rest your soul need rest they meant right now folks are so contented and thinking about their body and not their soul they meant folks are trying to please their affections and they are trying to please themselves and they're not trying to please God but the only way your soul can be satisfied and you can find rest for your soul the soul is hungry and thirsting for the Living God but what we're trying to do please ourselves and not our soul they meant with the soul gonna have to have a rest in please the soul got to have an ankle the Bible said the soul that sinneth it shall die they meant but you they meant that the Bible said the wages of sin is death remember the soul needs an anchor it needs a rest in place and I want you to know amen youth no soul can be incurred here and 13 verse 4 and 13 but I would have you I would not have you to be ignorant they met Paul said some folk was ignorant and he silent want you to be are you up there there's a lot of evening folks but I don't want you to be ignorant amen if our gospel be hid its hid to them that are what love whom the god of this world has what God the devil of blind your mind but don't have folks have got excuses they won't excuse for being ignorant but Paul says I don't want you to be grit are you with me your soul is not ain't it amen and what your preacher say your soul is anchored in the world he meant you were responsible to God they meant to come to a resting place and it only can be rested even in the world on the ankle that holds you his word and this anchor this hope is an anchor to your soul but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them that what sleep they're not dead they meant the end of six dimension beyond the curtain of time and they said we're resting on it are you resting on what you preach what Paul preached the same gospel one gospel amen it's not another gospel but one gospel it's not for each denomination each church it's only one gospel and it's the same gospel he meant the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and vailable amen when I say to one I say at all amen god no judged every man according to his word one day the book is going to be opening amen and you will be charged according to what's written in the book brother and sister one line up you might as well get it right now you might look see and look at your life and look in the book and she

somebody else not not not not man not not to church not not not the bishop not the Pope not the press but the law or you up there the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout amen in the voice of an archangel amen I believe God know how to wake up the dead I believe God know how to wake you up Amen I think God knew how he knew how to wake me up when I was dead and trust my sin my sin amen I heard the voice of God they meant when it called me out of my see Amen I believe that that voice did not leave me when when when Jesus came into my life I believe that voice still speaks to me I mean he's still leading me I believe he didn't save me and got me out of the mess that I was in and they said that I was he but God stayed Amen praise God along with I stay with God God's team with me I want you to know there's something about God when it come to getcha he can take you all the way praise God sometimes you try to drift away from that voice but God said no no brother sister you've got to come back you got to come back and repent you like to come back they make the calls our Savior and I didn't save you the loser are you a man let me save him he can keep us are you if you didn't love you he lets it go on and one out there and do what the welcome rest of the world does he meant but it brings condemnation to you amen and makes you a shame of yourself they meant you have to come to repentance you have to say god I'm sorry he meant God please have mercy on me I confess my sins knowing that you're faithful and just to forgive me I'm not just doing he said and my little children I write unto you that you sin not but if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous they met God calls us back to repentance amen he said but what should we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid amen so God don't want you to sin amen but if if you make a mistake not willfully but if you make a mistake sense of God that's been born again does not willfully go out here commit adultery fornication live steal and cheat but those folk I'm saved folk in the folk that's not giving God all ten of eight part of the book you don't want to eat the whole pain you're not sealed you might have had a feeling but you are not sealed you got to come to the point all of you I won't ever attain the glow for me I won't the true baptism of the Holy go down in my soul my soul I want to be a good I said my soul is ain't good amen my soul is a hope that anchors of the soul we made will rest in order the god got something akin to my soul to my soul hallelujah he promised that I never leave you I never was SiC that I'll be with you always even to the end of the world on the end of Ages I believe he's here to anchor your soul they'll take you to the storms of life he's wrinkled amen they ain't go to the soul God is good to us but we treat him any kind of way let me let me just go to Philippians I gotta cut it short for lipping this here it's an anchor to the soul brother and sister that's times in our lives and you feel like giving up they remember something inside me telling me to go hands go ahead go ahead hey man go ahead go ahead I got to keep going on I can't stop I gotta keep on going he met the devil tell me what's the use Amen you just up and down and you just turn it around but let the devil know hey man I know it's something doctor make me some wow because the deep is calling to the place that you can go that's within the veil faded well the forerunner for asking hallelujah Diana please hallelujah that God wants you to go let your soul technique hallelujah no children tossed to and fro what everywhere oh sure I got an ankle brother/sister we need more than just good religion we need more than just being a good Christian a good person we need something like our soul we can put away the alcohol we can put away the drugs we can put away the pornography we can put away all unclean things and get something that's going to I was so what Evers him yes what Evers hitting your brother hey man I won't you take a look to Jesus Jesus amen - Jesus we can make it hallelujah hallelujah I know I can make it oh yes no more playing around with your soul they because one of these days you'll wake up in hell one of these day you wake up of God mercy one of these days you realize all your wandering thoughts and he meant when you wander away from God's plan and God's purpose for your life don't find yourself he met somewhere in the valley he meant praise God when all hope is lost and you in the violet of the dry bones they meant don't find yourself way far away from God I was sinking deep in sin far from the peace with shores amen hallelujah but I heard they made the voice of the master they made and God is speaking now from the waters lifted me now say am i will you let him I allow him to lift you up to I mean three and seven for living is three and seven brother and sister I want you to come to that conclusion he says here but what things were gain to me those are count what I count loss for Christ I want you to give it up I bet all you have achieved and all you have accomplished I count loss I'm ready to give it up I'm ready to lose all the things that I've gained praise God I'm willing that's Paul said wherefore they meant seeing with compassed about with so cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight let's lay let's lay it down every weight and there is sin that does so easily beset us and let us run with patience that is set before us they meant there isn't hope that God wants to give you the hope govern anchor your soul amen you can anchor your soul in a confidence the confidence in God the trust that you can trust our God to keep his promises the promises that he made whatever ham God kept its promises then as our minister Palmer said on Friday night against hope he believed in hope and he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief they meant but being fully persuaded he knew that what God promised or you would man that faith that Abraham had brother sister you know anchor your soul amen you can have the hope that's gonna anchor your soul are you up there I won't turn around things for Christ what you're holding on to a brother what are you holding on to sister we are you willing to give it up the kind of laws what is that thing that's pulling you away from Christ who is that person of what is that thing ja family friends what is it that's holding you back from giving a god you're all are you willing to surrender are you willing to give it up I counted all lost sheep all had contacted had come to a resolve he's come to a placed and I am resolved amen I'm ready I'm ready to be offered up I'm ready amen Paul came to that place under the Masters Road that I met God when I met him they meant something happened to me brother and sister when I met him some happened to them something happened to me I was never the same you cannot be the same Alba coming with the loving God the launcher care about you that wants to help you more than you want to be helped he wants to save and deliver you more than you want to be he wants to heal he wants to bless you more than you want to be bless you only trust him Oh was willing because he had found something that was more precious to him than all that he had attained and achieve so he realized that I'm I realized I got something that means more to me that all this world amen so he says yay Dauntless I count all things loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have for whom I have suffered the loss of all things suffer the loss of all things that's what I find in most Christians they don't mind having the power of God but not many Christians want to suffer I know but I said the sweeten it better it's not gonna be every day the Sun ain't gonna shine and sometimes we're gonna need some rain but we don't want the rain we like the Sun but I tell you if you want the crops to grow you need the Sun and you need the rain are you with me so sometimes we have to go through some troubles and some trials and tests and tribulation not many hold out they walk back they believe God didn't left them God not with them no more the only time they thanked God with them when they blessing and when they got this and got that one then they start to struggle a little bit they believe God didn't left them and they leave God when they're not getting what they want and what they think they need they turned it back on God when they go through a little trouble a little persecution Paul said welcome separate me from the love of God Church revelation persecution distress said I let nothing not things brethren not things to come that angels I'm gonna let nothing separate me from the love of God time folk go through a little trouble they give up on God there's not many Christians standing no more people go to church say they believe the word they say they say like the devil they're not willing to spend time with God but in Romans I pay my tithes and my old friend and do this and go through the motions and be religious brothers so to take more than that it takes a consecrated dedicating life to God he sees you when you're doing your dark stuff he knows when you sneak in here yeah when you're having a conversation that is not godly and going on God miss stuff he sees that he knows it why don't you get it right with God - stop playing Church they met one day you got to get serious and why not get serious now brother said well you oughta not say these things amen have a little matter having a patient I'm for you to get right with God I stopped Moloch reason is we're living in troubled times but I believe God wants to anchor your soul I believe God want to give you something to get you straight with God are you up this medicine is good for you so he says here I count all things lost for the ecstasy of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ brother have you won Christ yet sister have you won Christ yet what are you holding on to he said I want that I might win Christ amen are you still losing you losing the battle something you're holding on to causing you to lose but Paul says which hope we have as an ankle to the soul somebody said we're resting on it say here it says that and be found in him that's why I want to be found how about you and be found in him not having my own what righteousness I don't want my own righteous you see sometimes we please ourselves and we deceive ourselves not having my own righteousness amen I'm just not satisfied with what I think is right because I want to be right with the word not what I think not what I believe but what the word says because what I believe might be a little bit open the Word of God is the final fact the final say-so are you up man so you got to look to the word not you could have confidence in the reachable on your final absolute is the word it's the Word of God and you go back to the word and see what the word said about it and you go by what the Bible say not what man say but what the Bible say are you up in PO the absolute with the Word of God not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I might know that I may know him in the power of his resurrection that's alright we don't mind knowing him in the power of his resurrection we like to see signs and wonders and miracles and all the laughs we love when he's healing when he's working miracles in touching 6 and we get shouting and me paying our bills and blessing us on every side and oh we shout and dancing well what about the bitter when it comes what about when the persecution comes somebody said they don't like you what about when they telling lies on you what about when they treat you treating your own I believe the Prophet Eli - how does she was drunk well you woke me that she told him I wasn't wrong see the Prophet made a mistake he thought she was drunk are you with me then she told him it I want a son that's why I was agonizing here oh you up man sometimes God even let his servant hard thing probably like I said he did well would you the woman said unless she told a lot she says well he's well with the sign did well he said she day as well somebody here but she still said as well why because she was calling no thing to be knighted to go to learn she believed is aware because she got to God Simon and she knew all was going to be well she didn't give up in a psalm again she believed that God was gonna do something about that are you with me that woman had hope hope the hope is an anchor to the soul ruled and couldn't have a child but God taught as an eyes and the prophet told us she gonna have a son she said if I have one go god amen there's a God of knowledge about him actions away and if he give me the son I'm gonna give him back to the law amen she had faith oh god don't somebody believe God today but will serving a living God
