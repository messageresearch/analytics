appreciate again everyone listening in and those that are here as we talk about the purpose of the storm or your stone the purpose sometimes we wonder why the test when we have tried to do our best but we understand it better by and by Said by and by when the morning come amen Jonah one now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of am saying arise go to nma that great City and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee un tares from the presence of the Lord and went down to japa and he found the ship going to tares so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them to tares from the presence of the Lord but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so that the ship was aike to be broken may God bless you the reading of his [Music] word know what look like we getting feed by your verb so the ship was about to break and God sent a storm sometimes and we wonder why the storm when God send your a storm your way sometimes we wonder why I know Paul says all things work together to good to them that love the Lord to them who are the call according to his purpose and I said the purpose of the storm the purpose of the storm I hope that we can get these two passages of scriptures together together and kind of understand what some of us are going through and some have been through sometimes the church go through his storms families go through their Stones it's not going to be safe sailing all the time sometimes the waters going to get treacherous sometimes things are not going to go the way we feel like they ought to go sometimes the the temp temps are come sometimes the waters that get trouble but I I want to know how do you deal with your stone and you ask the question why why why did God send this wind this way why did God send these amen these battles and these troubles my way why did God send this wave that is tossing against the ship of my life why did God send it my way here the Book of Matthew 7 and 24 a little subtopic uh brother Mickey from uh Oregon would often times say every time I talk to him he says the ankle HS The Tempest is Raging but the anchor hes brother and sister I just use for a little subtopic D AER holes the Billows are beating but the ankle is still hes it says here 24 and7 therefore whosoever Hearth these says of [Music] mine and doth them I will like unto a wise man which buil his house upon a rock and the rains descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon on a rock purpose of the storm sometimes to see if the house is built right or not we know that our lives are locking into a we are locking into a house the church itself is the house of God God you and I are the Temple of the Living God but sometimes God want to test amen your foundation out God want to see whether or not amen uh whether you a real Christian or not whether you got the goods or not whether you got what you say you have whether you believe him or not God B the children of Israel out but he tested their faith God did great and wonderful things for them and bringing them out of Egypt and taking them through the Red Sea but yet amen God wanted to prove them sometimes the storm is to prove you amen will you still stand amen when the Storm come many folks amen when their Storm come they run from the presence of God Jonah was a man that amen when he faced the word of God he wanted God wanted him to do something that he didn't want to do you know we take our lives and we put them in our own hand but you say to the Lord where you lead me I'll follow I wonder sometimes do we know the leadership of the Lord or not I wonder sometimes are we leading ourselves uh and are we following our own thoughts and ideas or are we giving a prayerful are we praying and say God God me I find myself on my knees crying out God Amen I I don't want to do my will I want to do your will God what would you have me to do God how do you want me to handle this situation or that situation God I want to I I don't have time to fail now amen I come too far Amen to go in the wrong direction but Jonah said I don't want to do amen what God told me to do so I think I'll take a ship and I'll flee from the presence of the Lord amen because I sometimes Amen in justifying himself he don't think amen what God has given him is fa these Wicked people wicked wicked wicked Nal it's almost lot unto nonon with his leprosy he didn't want to go dip in mud of Jord amen that the word sometimes is heavy sometimes the word is difficult to Bear sometimes we don't want to do what the word say because it doesn't make sense to you amen God said it and it don't make I don't understand it not one bit he didn't say to you non I I understand what I say he said do what I say yeah sometimes we trying to figure out what God is saying in the word instead of obeying the word if I don't understand it if I don't see it I won't believe it but he said Thomas because you didn't see amen you said I won't believe I said blessed is he that has not seen but yet he believes why do God send Stones how do we deal with the stone or do do we deal with it as God testing our ankle and does our ankle hold no are we foolish or are we wise praise God because when God sent a storm in our marriage we get a divorce amen God is DET testing the marriage and will the marriage with an ankle will we say in better or worse in sickness or in health or when God sent a storm by amen we said let's get out of this amen we want to run from the word amen the word and our vow that we made to one another we run from the presence of the Lord instead of dealing with it and praying and asking God to am may give me Grace to run this race I made a commitment God to you are you with me and God I said I go with you all the way sickness in Hell amen I said unto death do us part and I don't want death to separate us amen because uh Paul says I I let nothing not death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers I'm not I'm not going to let nothing separate me from the love of God brother and sister you got to be persistent amen you got to be you got to persevere you got to know where you stand amen that your Anchor Holds amen my anchor holds this morning amen praise God I want to know whether you're building your house on a rock or whether you're building it on San today praise God uh your test your storm amen if it hasn't come as of yet it's coming amen many of us have uh we felt certain uh H amen storms and sometime it it it it was just a windstorm and sometimes it's a it's just a a small amen thing but when we go through a real hurricane storm amen sometimes God gives us a real amen a powerful stone look like amen the house is getting shaken amen because God send hurricanes sometime amen I believe that Jon did amen he amen was sleeping through the storm some folks amen don't realize amen uh that the ship that they're amen riding in uh amen that this thing is about to be broke into pieces and they're about to amen be destroyed amen Jonah amen was in a deep sleep amen but somebody went to wake up Jonah don't you understand what's going on Amen uh we all amen are here crying on on uh uh to our God why don't you get up and start crying then they turn around and they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah and Jonah said I I want you to know that I'm a man that's fleed I'm running from the presence of God you know I find that many folk came and they run all of their lives amen when things are not going right in their life they start running praise God they run to and fro amen I find when a man get to running amen they never stop running amen they keep running uh until they can find uh amen the the right situation uh that's going to help them through their navigate them through their lives uh and they always looking for the right situation uh some folk can't keep job uh amen they're looking uh for the right job uh amen they keep uh amen moving from job the job and situation theit situation because uh amen they find oh Lord oh it's a lot of of things that people run from some folks run from their own their own self amen because uh amen they don't want to face their own insufficiencies amen we ought to face the fact look in the mirror of the word and says uh I'm looking at a mean man I'm looking at a person that amen that needs the mercy from God sometimes we have to look in the mirror and we got to say uh amen I'm looking at a proud spirit and I got to be more humble amen sometimes we got to look at the mirror and we got to look amen at the damage uh that we've been amen uh dealt in life and sometimes our life has been very battered amen and our ship has been beaten uh amen and we look at our lives and there a lot of damage done and then we want to run instead of acing God let us repair the damage that is done in my life God you can heal all my wounds all the bruises Amen Hallelujah Lord You're the Healer and Lord I want to stay in the presence of the son that I can get right amen are you with me amen that it get hot in the presence of the son but that's the only way I'm going to get right amen the why get hot sometime but thank God the bitter can come sweet if you just stay there Lord long enough Hallelujah I said God can take a bitter situation and God can cause that situation to become sweet Hallelujah God can take a trouble sea and can make it and calm and peaceful but you got to stand the storm you can't flee to tares amen you got to go on down the Ena and face the fact that's if that's what God says that's why I got to go amen because that's where the presence of the Lord going to meet me amen God when I flee from his presence amen then I I I amen I'm I'm running into destruction amen I but you know God don't God God loves us don't he amen instead of letting us flee he sent a stone are you with me instead of letting us amen be destroyed and our soul and displeasing God and getting out the will of God God sends a stone amen sometime God Amen as the prophet of God said let he said I you know it it comes times in our lives that we rather die than to get out the will of God you know Lord lord I Love You Lord but if I'm going to get out your will then Lord take me home first CU most of all I want to please God are you with me but if you blown to God don't you know God Amen uh amen set a stone for your good amen if you are you with me because he love you and he know you don't know what you're doing amen Jonah did not understand that I I I don't believe that he faced the fact I don't believe that it got deep enough down in the inside of him he thought he could do what God told him amen not to do and get away with it I'm going tell you if God let you get away with it then it's going to work I don't know about to your good but it going to work to God's good praise God praise God because if you blown to God Amen God going he'll turn he'll turn things around and you blown to him but if not amen amen he just let you go out on in your own way and never ever learn and never able to come into the knowledge of the truth are you with me praise God never a just sign some folk amen they just uh you know somebody said bone Liars I don't want to say it like that but some folk just can't help from lying praise God some folk are going to tell you a lie ain't got no reason to tell you a lie but they just going to tell you a lie because they just can't help themselves you say oh you talking about the unsaved folk no you talking about folk that set up in the church and tell lies are you with me so I don't didn't want to get on that I want to be pleasant okay God is good amen you love him today okay but uh nevertheless you got to understand that's why you got to understand every situation amen that comes in your life though it seem to be hard to Bear amen God got a purpose in that though it seems hard and sometimes the things seem impossible to Bear amen but God Amen knows that he will put no more on you than you're able to Bear God said there's no temptation taken us but such as common to man but God with the Temptation will make a way of are you with me God Will Take Care of Business come on when preacher don't take care care when Mama don't take care when Daddy don't take care don't you know that God is God hallelujah and he's able amen if he allowed the storm then don't say Lord Lord sometimes send a storm to get us back amen what in the will of God amen praise God I didn't want to minister this I thought I was going to minister something all together different then I just kept on said Lord that this is way you want me to go said well I can't get away let me just finish reading this in Matthew see I I realized that that a storm has hit the nation this pandemic is it's it's a real storm just about every church that I know of is been affected by people are are dying people are going to hospital people are amen they are on the jobs and they are going through it it it's real saints But realize the storm is for a purpose amen sometime God has to slow us down to speak to us are you with me God why are you to allow certain things that come my way amen thank him and all things give thanks thank you Lord instead of looking at it and complaining about it thank God that you through the storm God I love you the more I still say You're My Healer I still say you're my keeper I still say that you God Jonah said to them throw me overboard just get me out of this ship y'all will be all right amen Jonah amen knew that he was the cause of the Storm come on somebody Hallelujah why amen the ship is being tossed why we going two amen maybe Jah amen you don't want to do what God [Music] said they throw him over board and God a't God good he prepared a fish amen going swallow him up get in me amen and Jonah I can see him going down down down he said that all over now and the fish came and even had oxygen inside the fish Lord have mercy inside the fish belly amen Jonah began to pray are you with me oh does God God had to put us down for us to pray and to be willing to accept amen God I'm out to Will I want to get in your will God I've been running from your presence but I want to come back to your presence because I don't want to do what you told me to do are you with me some folk came at a a run from the presence of the Lord but Jonah recognize yeah something is wrong you know somebody sometimes folks said I got a word from the Lord and sometime they word from the Lord I know it didn't come from the Lord but I ain't going to tell them and they come from the Lord cuz they said the Lord told them and I said oh think of the Lord told you you said the Lord told you go ahead on do what the Lord say even though I know you're lying on the Lord are you with me you know some folks said God told me to do this and God told me to do that God didn't tell him to do a thing but how you going to argue with them when they tell you if they tell a lie on God what you think they going to tell on you if you want to know whether God told you check it out by the word and if it's against the word then go let God ain't going to go against his own word isn't that right if God goes against his own word then God will be a liar like you and the Bible said God cannot lie that sound like I'm fussing a oh aen because I tell you the truth you know what I'm saying why God send storms your way why did God allow certain things to happen in our lives amen God trying to get our attention because he trying to navigate us back in the will of God though amen Jonah went down in the depths of he said out of the depths of hell I cry and then he said I look towards your holy Temple amen Lord I'm I'm going pray now and I'm going look towards your Holy Temple and I'm going to look I'm not looking at amen down in the sea and the Billows and all of that but I'm going look towards your Holy Temple amen and and these Lon vanities amen I God I st coming I can see the anointing coming back to Jonah Jonah ready to do what God Said now oh I feel the spirit down here in this uh this great fish belly I feel the spirit amen I believe he got anointed and fired up praise God I believe the spirit got on him and begin to navigate that that fish and all of a sudden the fish might have had to turn around amen praise God I got a destination that I got to meet he might didn't know which way nma was down there because he didn't have amen a navigating system but amen God knew amen Jonah got his amen heart in condition sometimes our heart got to get in condition amen that the word of God Amen and the will of God can be done in our lives amen sometime we can't amen sometimes we looking at things all watch sided and all backwards and and think we amen got the mind of God and the will of God God Amen don't want you to be mean and nasty and disrespectable God wants you to be humble and meek even when you're right amen sometimes you have to take wrong are you with me sometime you have to amen Jesus even when he was right sometimes he had to be wrong amen if they called him a devil and b a b he had to take it are you with me he couldn't convince them no different they determined in their heart that he was a devil and that he had a devil ain't nothing he could do about it and a devil twist somebody head and mind and begin to instead of loving you they begin to hey come on don't let no devil out of the pitch of Hell put anything in you but love amen I'm going tell you your your Anchor Holds when you can love in spite in spite of the persecution in spite of those that talk about you in spite of those that do you wrong in spite of what you're going through you can still say I love you and I forgive you are you with me the prophet said the Jews cried out how long will you aveng us avenge us amen but the the bride says I forgive you are you with me so I wonder if your ankle hold I wonder does your ankle hold or you say I ain't going to have nothing that nothing I heard the last time I heard for the last time I ain't going to have nothing nothing nothing to do with are you with me sometimes that's your storm is for your Perfection it's to perfect you amen some sometime God put somebody in your life just to keep you sometime God put somebody in the church that don't like you and nothing you can say or preach amen going to make them feel better they won't even say Amen until they get somebody that uh come in from overseas or somewhere are you with me and they can say the same thing that you've been saying all the time but they can't you can't get amen at them if you take a crowbar and try to private at them but if somebody come overseas say the same thing they oh I heard the spirit say you see what I'm saying some people can hear the spirit when it's in certain folk but the the Bible said amen the words that I speaking to you their spirit in their life the word of God God got power in the word the word will do what the word was s to do if you would hear the word and then we want to know what your ankor hole those that hear the word amen and I wanted to fall on good ground amen those that got a honest and sincere heart Amen to believe God don't matter who says it right I remember as a young Christian I had trouble with certain folk amen that even told me the truth truth because I had heard bad things about them and because I had heard bad things about those individuals when they were telling me things that I needed to know and things that was good for me amen then I just about turn my death a see what I'm saying and I learned through life where folk feed you with a spirit amen I said now that person out of all the preachers that gave me advice amen they pointed out all the fault in the preacher so I couldn't receive from that preacher but he was giving me the best
