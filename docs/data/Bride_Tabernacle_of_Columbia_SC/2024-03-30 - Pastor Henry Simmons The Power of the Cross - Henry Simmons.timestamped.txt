[37:56] shout up here
[37:58] amen we thank God
[38:02] Amen not that I want to make you
[38:05] shout but it's something about the name
[38:07] of Jesus ought to make you
[38:10] shout it says here for Christ sent me
[38:15] not to baptize but to preach the
[38:18] gospel not with wisdom words least the
[38:22] Cross of Christ should be made a what
[38:26] none effect
[38:29] for we preach for the preaching of the
[38:34] what is to them that perish what
[38:38] foolishness but unto us which are what
[38:43] save it is the
[38:44] what power of God you may be
[38:50] seated we said that there's no
[38:56] substitute
[38:58] for certain things and there's no
[39:01] substitute for the preaching of the
[39:03] Cross when he
[39:06] said go and preach the gospel to Every
[39:09] Creature I believe he didn't say go
[39:10] preach Mysteries to Every
[39:12] Creature he said go preach the gospel to
[39:15] Every
[39:17] Creature isn't that right he that
[39:20] believeth in his baptized shall be what
[39:23] saved and these signs shall follow them
[39:25] that believe amen is the word of God the
[39:29] same today if it is the same then amen
[39:32] it ought to have the same
[39:34] effects are you with me it's the power
[39:38] of the Gospel amen nothing takes the
[39:41] place of the Gospel I don't care how
[39:44] many Mysteries you know nothing takes
[39:46] the place of the
[39:48] Gospel
[39:49] amen Jesus said I am the way the truth
[39:54] and the life no man can come to the
[39:56] father but by me
[39:58] are you with me the gospel amen he said
[40:03] the I said the power of the
[40:06] Cross amen the power of the
[40:10] Cross amen when the cross is not being
[40:13] preached the gospel is not being
[40:16] preached because it's on the
[40:19] cross it's at the cross where our
[40:25] first because if you don't see the cross
[40:29] you hadn't seen the light
[40:31] yet are you with me you might recognize
[40:35] that God called his people out of
[40:37] mystery of Babylon call them with the
[40:39] messenger and the message of the hour
[40:41] amen but that don't mean nothing if you
[40:44] don't see the
[40:47] cross praise God you said I came to the
[40:51] mess but did you come to Jesus did you
[40:54] see the power of the cross oh amen it's
[40:59] something about the cross fall you fall
[41:02] in love with Jesus because you see how
[41:05] much he cared about you to die for your
[41:09] sin if you don't see
[41:12] that then all is
[41:14] vain amen we might like people the
[41:18] church we might like amen uh the the the
[41:22] people in the church we might like the
[41:24] preacher but do you know that the power
[41:28] of the Gospel the power of the
[41:32] Cross and what the cross means to
[41:36] you and they said Easter but before
[41:38] Easter was the
[41:41] cross before the resurrection he had to
[41:45] die Amen Let me just read a little bit
[41:48] of this for it is written I will destroy
[41:52] the wi I will destroy the excuse me I
[41:56] will dest destroy the wisdom of the what
[42:01] wise people too smart because they too
[42:04] simple they don't want to believe
[42:07] this they think everything got to be
[42:11] mystified everything got to be on up
[42:15] there somewhere make you feel like you
[42:17] on a high somewhere amen but this is God
[42:22] hides himself in Simplicity and reveals
[42:24] himself in the same it's Jesus
[42:28] Christ
[42:31] amen what is the message it's the
[42:34] opening of the
[42:35] word are you with me this word must
[42:39] become more real to you than ever
[42:42] before this Bible amen through all the
[42:46] denomination of Creeds and dogmas of men
[42:49] the Bible becomes your
[42:52] absolute are you with
[42:56] me
[42:57] the
[42:59] Bible I will destroy the wisdom of the
[43:03] wise and I will bring to what nothing to
[43:08] understanding of the prent a lot of
[43:10] smart people a lot of people that think
[43:13] they know
[43:15] something but to know him is life do you
[43:21] know
[43:22] Jesus do you really know
[43:25] Jesus to know him is
[43:28] life amen some people say you know they
[43:32] know about Jesus but do you know
[43:36] him I heard about him but do you have a
[43:39] personal relationship with Jesus
[43:43] Christ has he come into your heart has
[43:46] he come into your
[43:47] life do you really know
[43:50] Jesus or do you it's an intellectual
[43:56] thought
[43:58] he said he that believeth on me as the
[44:00] scripture said then out of his belly
[44:02] shall flow what rivers of Living
[44:05] Water this word be got to become life to

[44:22] and me you got to be
[44:26] one we want to live on the
[44:29] outside but we want to declare that he's
[44:32] on the inside if he's on the inside your
[44:35] life must be a manifestation of
[44:39] him you're here to reproduce Jesus
[44:42] Christ in Bride
[44:45] form M Jesus
[44:48] Christ are you with
[44:53] me he
[44:56] says where is the wise where are the
[45:01] stries where is the disputers of this
[45:04] world has not God made what foolishness
[45:08] the wisdom of this world got so many
[45:11] smart people that gone off on this path
[45:15] that path all of them say we believe the
[45:18] same thing we believe the same
[45:20] Bible but yet you got
[45:23] aund I mean thousands of more than
[45:27] denominations and all and people believe
[45:29] this and that and all that but we got
[45:32] one God one Bible one Jesus one Lord One
[45:37] Faith one baptism ain't that right but
[45:39] everybody got their own thoughts about
[45:41] it amen one
[45:43] message but everybody got Thunders Two
[45:47] Souls all kind of stuff amen one one
[45:51] Jesus amen okay don't cut him up in
[45:56] parts
[45:57] just make it
[45:59] simple
[46:02] amen people want to
[46:06] elevate themselves above other people
[46:10] they want to push themselves up and make
[46:13] themselves something special you're
[46:17] already special if you're born
[46:19] again if you have the baptism the Holy
[46:21] Ghost you're special that mean God has
[46:24] signified that the blood has been
[46:26] applied to your life
[46:28] are you with me so you are special in
[46:31] the sight of
[46:32] God
[46:33] Amen so nobody's going to make you any
[46:36] more important or special to God because
[46:39] they are preaching something that high
[46:42] and mighty and make you think that your
[46:44] head and shoulders above everybody else
[46:46] time for all of that is over
[46:48] with people have taken flights and
[46:51] thinking that they were gone
[46:54] somewhere and then we see after a while
[46:57] those people didn't even have the simple
[46:59] principles of the love of God in their
[47:03] heart I
[47:04] remember brother came by me years ago

[1:05:44] over oh yes I'm
[1:05:48] glad I'm glad so glad he
[1:05:54] did
[1:06:01] for I receive of the Lord that which
[1:06:03] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:06:06] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:06:08] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:06:10] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:06:13] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:06:16] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:06:20] the same manner he also took the cup and
[1:06:23] when he had suck saying this cup is the
[1:06:26] New Testament in my blood this do ye as
[1:06:29] often as you drink it and remember to me
[1:06:32] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:06:35] drank this
[1:06:36] cup you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:06:41] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:06:45] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:06:49] unworthy shall be guilty of the body and
[1:06:54] the blood of the
[1:07:30] [Music]
[1:07:55] and sickly among you and many
[1:08:00] asleep you got to take it serious cuz
[1:08:04] people get sick people die because they
[1:08:08] take it unworthy so what happened to
[1:08:10] sister so so what happened to Brother s
[1:08:13] song didn't it didn't happen in
[1:08:16] denomination of church everybody just
[1:08:18] took it and went out and get them a
[1:08:20] drink after smoke a cigarette
[1:08:23] after but when it comes down to
[1:08:26] truth people do it things
[1:08:29] happen are you with
[1:08:33] me for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:08:36] should not be judged but when we are
[1:08:40] judged we are chasen of the Lord that we
[1:08:44] should not be condemned with the
[1:08:48] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:08:51] come together to eat tear one for
[1:08:54] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:08:57] eat at home that you come not together
[1:09:00] unto condemnation and the rest will I
[1:09:03] set an order when I
[1:09:05] come people can commit adultery they can
[1:09:08] lie to steal and cheat they can take
[1:09:11] communion why because that's the kind of
[1:09:14] church they go to you said what you
[1:09:16] talking about denomination I don't care
[1:09:18] if it's denomination I don't care if
[1:09:20] it's message people do that kind of
[1:09:23] stuff are they better off oh no they in
[1:09:27] worse shape because they supposed to
[1:09:28] know better are you with me it's a lie
[1:09:33] I'm not trying to scare you but it's a
[1:09:34] lie some people just miss communion they
[1:09:37] don't want to
[1:09:38] come
[1:09:39] because they just say well I miss
[1:09:42] it the Bible told Peter when he's
[1:09:45] talking about watching his feet Peter
[1:09:47] said you never wash my feet he said if I
[1:09:49] don't watch you amen you going you ain't
[1:09:53] going to have no problem with me amen
[1:09:57] what was communion
[1:09:58] about when Abraham met
[1:10:02] mzc are you with me the
[1:10:06] slaughter and what was the blood of the
[1:10:09] Passover all about he said when I see
[1:10:11] the blood I pass over
[1:10:13] you are you with me so we pring the
[1:10:17] cross we talking about Jesus cross when
[1:10:19] I see the
[1:10:21] cross was it important
[1:10:23] there the sacrifice of the lamb and
[1:10:27] Passover and so forth was it important
[1:10:29] then what about now people saying it
[1:10:32] ain't important I miss it I ain't
[1:10:35] coming you know what I'm saying you said
[1:10:38] communion ain't nobody wor to take it
[1:10:41] tell you you confess your sins the Bible
[1:10:45] say he's faithful in just to what
