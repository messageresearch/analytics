[34:34] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[34:37] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[34:39] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[34:42] his he has chosen Us in him before the
[34:45] foundation of the world that we should
[34:48] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[34:51] love having predestinated us unto the
[34:55] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[34:58] himself according to the good pleasure
[35:01] of his will to whom the praise and glory
[35:05] for
[35:09] to to the praise of the glory of his
[35:14] grace when he has made us acceptable in

[35:23] according to the riches of his grace God
[35:26] bless you read this word you may be
[35:28] seated
[35:31] so in the
[35:35] fifth verse having predestinated us into
[35:38] adoption of children
[35:41] by Jesus Christ to himself
[35:43] according to the good pledge of his will
[35:47] so this morning we want to talk to you
[35:50] about con adoption
[35:55] and um
[35:58] having to do with
[36:01] the your place the placing of a son
[36:08] the placing of a son adoption
[36:12] somebody says
[36:14] he sent forth the spirit of his son into
[36:17] our hearts here in Galatians 4.
[36:22] Galatians 4 and 1.
[36:24] adoption
[36:28] you know when we think about adoption
[36:30] and
[36:31] from uh the American standpoint and our
[36:34] day we think about a child that's going
[36:37] up for adoption out of a family
[36:41] had been adopted into another family
[36:44] but adoption uh according to the law of
[36:48] adoption
[36:50] it's the child that as you your own son
[36:55] and it's coming to maturity
[36:58] it's going to be on the tutor and
[37:00] governor and then he comes into his
[37:04] position
[37:07] now
[37:09] I wrote down some are you ready to be
[37:12] crowned or are you ready to rule
[37:14] adoption you come to a place that you
[37:17] can be trusted
[37:19] come to a place of maturity
[37:23] and that's what we're talking about you
[37:25] know most people just think that I'm
[37:28] just satisfied with just being saved or
[37:30] just satisfied with saying Jesus I love
[37:33] you Jesus uh thank you for saving me
[37:36] forgiving me and uh I'm I'm a Christian
[37:39] I'm a child of God and sometimes they
[37:42] use the terminology I'm born again and
[37:45] this and that and I'm saying there are
[37:47] many people of that persuasion out there
[37:49] and they're doing a marvelous job trying
[37:52] to get people to accept Jesus Christ and
[37:55] come out from the pardon the clubs and
[37:58] the all the different things that go
[38:00] along with worldly living they're trying
[38:03] to you know be churchy and go to church
[38:06] and love the Lord and
[38:09] that's as far as they go that's all
[38:11] that's their Outlook that's what they're
[38:13] looking for but adoption goes a little
[38:16] farther than just and I'm saying most of
[38:19] most
[38:21] uh most people are satisfied that's it
[38:25] you know that's it that's all I want
[38:28] you know somebody said if I can just
[38:30] make it in that's all I want to do I
[38:32] just want to make it in
[38:34] and there's others that
[38:38] reap the benefits of being the child of
[38:40] God
[38:42] they they are they want all the
[38:44] blessings that come with me in the child
[38:46] of God
[38:48] others are just satisfying not just so
[38:51] glad I'm saying Lord I'm so glad you
[38:54] know
[38:55] and and that set 40 50 years satisfied
[39:01] being the baby
[39:05] a baby
[39:07] you know the Bible says there's newborn
[39:09] babies is out of sincere Miracle of the
[39:11] word that they might grow some people
[39:14] they said I'm a baby
[39:17] as far as growing that's all right I
[39:20] don't want to grow I just want to stay a
[39:22] baby you know I'm saved and that's why
[39:25] you see so many
[39:27] uh uh people that say I'm a Christian
[39:29] every now and then they might curse
[39:31] every now and then they might backslide
[39:33] every now and then they might do some
[39:35] stuff that they not supposed to do
[39:37] because babies babies you know they
[39:40] can't walk they they crawl you know
[39:43] a lot of times they fall and they
[39:45] stumble and you know because they're
[39:47] babies you look for that out of babies
[39:50] but
[39:51] how would you like to have a baby that's
[39:54] 12 14 years old
[39:57] and still crawling
[40:01] Bob I want some milk
[40:04] I want some milk
[40:07] you know it's the babies where's my food
[40:12] you know you got Christians that
[40:15] want somebody to be responsible for the
[40:20] needs
[40:22] their needs
[40:25] see even coming into
[40:27] a teenage a lot of times parents are
[40:31] taking care and the the needs but it it
[40:35] comes a time when we move from leaning
[40:39] on our parents and laying on them to buy
[40:44] the food and you tell them what I want
[40:45] to eat today
[40:48] I don't want none of that would you go
[40:50] out and get me something else sometimes
[40:52] parents are obedient to the children
[40:55] okay what do you want
[40:58] I feel like this today I said okay well
[41:01] that's what I cook well I feel like I
[41:04] want some pork chops
[41:07] well okay okay what do you want I want
[41:11] some McDonald's
[41:12] [Music]
[41:14] what do you want
[41:16] I'm on Kentucky Fried Chicken so
[41:20] children
[41:21] they don't worry about where you're
[41:23] gonna get the money from
[41:26] they they don't think about whether or
[41:29] not you have the money they just want
[41:30] what they want
[41:32] and like a lot of Believers in church
[41:34] they just come and they expect it's what
[41:38] I want
[41:40] and I just want what I want babies
[41:44] I just want to feel good
[41:46] I just want a shot I want some good
[41:48] singing I want some good preaching and I
[41:50] want to go home
[41:52] and thank y'all
[41:55] but
[41:56] if you come to work out your soul
[41:58] salvation
[42:00] you don't want to go to work
[42:02] see
[42:04] it's another thing parents you know they
[42:07] said we're all living in the Mama's
[42:09] house and Daddy's house and and I ain't
[42:11] got to go nowhere but it's got to give
[42:13] what somehow you got to get out the nest
[42:18] you can't stand the nest all the time
[42:20] the eagle
[42:21] they think
[42:23] the little eaglets got to get out the
[42:26] nest
[42:27] are you with me
[42:29] so every now and then you'll never if
[42:31] you don't use those wings you never fly
[42:35] so the Little Eagles in the nests and
[42:37] Mama Eagle going down and killing the
[42:39] prey of bringing it back and feeding
[42:41] them
[42:42] then it comes a time when Mama you can
[42:44] say y'all too big to be in this nest
[42:48] it meant y'all Wings them to sprout out
[42:50] and amen we don't fed you enough it's
[42:53] time to fly
[42:56] so sometimes the mother Eagles takes a
[42:58] little ego up high in the sky and let
[43:01] them drop and see whether or not testing
[43:03] wings out if they're not able to make it
[43:05] mother eager scoop them back up and test
[43:08] them out again then what happens because
[43:12] they don't want to get out the nest
[43:13] mother Eagle begin to make the nest a
[43:16] little stick in a little hard on the
[43:18] Rocky and so forth make it uncomfortable
[43:23] to take you that you might Sprout up
[43:26] wings
[43:28] the Holy Spirit In Our Lives sometimes
[43:30] gives us a a time that we're not
[43:34] comfortable or too much comfort amen
[43:37] he makes things a little uh difficult
[43:40] that you need to get stronger in the law
[43:45] amen God wants to make you stronger amen
[43:49] and sometimes amen our trials are there
[43:52] too
[43:54] make us strong are you with me
[43:57] so I'm talking about going into adoption
[43:59] amen going to a place where you want
[44:02] your crown and you want to rule not just
[44:05] coming to church and amen looking oh no
[44:09] we're talking about being positionally
[44:12] placed
[44:14] we talk about coming into adoption
[44:18] though you were though you are sons and
[44:22] though you are children of God though
[44:23] your sons
[44:27] amen that that's good
[44:34] that's good to be a Son of God a
[44:36] daughter God
[44:38] but that's not enough that's not
[44:40] your you know God saved the people out
[44:43] of uh out of Egypt but the Egypt was not
[44:47] what where God wanted to place him I
[44:50] mean the Wilderness was not where God
[44:52] wanted to place him God was taking him
[44:54] on to Canaan land
[44:57] and God has taken you on to your
[45:00] position your place into what he called
[45:02] you into the kingdom what he attained
[45:05] for you to be before the foundation of
[45:07] the world
[45:08] and so God has a place in amen has a
[45:12] position for you
[45:14] that it's been prepared for you to
[45:18] fulfill that position in Christ
[45:22] amen and so God has a a a work that's
[45:25] been pre-ordained before the foundation
[45:28] of the world that only fits you
[45:32] amen
[45:34] so you must understand that it's not
[45:37] just coming to church amen it's not just
[45:40] saying I'm saved God then took away uh
[45:44] the taste of this so I don't smoke no
[45:46] more I don't drink no more I don't Club
[45:49] no more I don't fornicate no more I
[45:51] don't commit adultery no more I don't
[45:54] steal no more don't lie no more that's
[45:56] fine that's a Christian
[45:59] that's a Christian
[46:01] but
[46:03] that's just
[46:04] what Sons and Daughters supposed to be
[46:07] are you with me
[46:09] but there's a higher calling let me just
[46:12] read it in Galatians 4 and 1 for a
[46:15] minute and and try to put some
[46:17] Foundation to the what we're saying it
[46:20] says now I say
[46:23] that an ear as long as he is a child
[46:28] are you with me
[46:30] different nothing from a servant
[46:34] though he be Lord of all
[46:37] but is on the tutor and Governor until
[46:40] the time appointed of the father
[46:44] even so we when we were children were in
[46:50] bondage under the elements of the world
[46:52] so he saw in another stage how when we
[46:55] were children we were under the bondage
[46:56] of the world Amen
[46:59] but
[47:00] when the fullness of time was come God
[47:04] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[47:07] under the law to redeem them that were
[47:10] under the law
[47:13] there was not a law that could save us
[47:16] there was not a law that could justify
[47:18] us there was not a law that could
[47:20] sanctify us there was not a law Amen to
[47:23] forgive our sins
[47:26] are you with me
[47:28] so under the law it just identified that
[47:32] you we were sinners
[47:34] it identified our condition
[47:37] but none of the laws could justify us
[47:40] could sanctifies amen
[47:43] it took oh let me go
[47:46] that we might receive the adoption of
[47:49] sons
[47:51] the adoption of sons
[47:54] he said
[47:56] and because ye the sixth verse says but
[47:59] but because you are what
[48:02] not because you you know
[48:06] because you are Sons
[48:08] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[48:12] see when the Holy Ghost come to you and
[48:15] fill you amen it identifies who you are
[48:19] it because you are Sons
[48:22] God sent forth the spirit of his son
[48:25] amen so you know that when God fills you
[48:29] with the Holy Ghost it's because you are
[48:31] Sons
[48:33] amen God had you in his mind before the
[48:38] foundation of the world and God through
[48:40] knew you and he predestinated you
[48:42] Ephesians said unto adoption
[48:47] are you a bit
[48:49] your destiny is adoption your destiny is
[48:52] just not to be saved and just set in the
[48:55] church and don't you know I mean you
[48:58] know just a wall fly away amen you have
[49:01] an office to fulfill you have a a duty
[49:05] amen we are his workmanship created in
[49:07] Christ Jesus unto good works amen work
[49:11] out your soul salvation with fear and
[49:13] trembling there is a work to do
[49:17] and you must be about your father's
[49:20] business
[49:21] amen so a servant is trained in the
[49:25] father's business
[49:26] a son is trained in his father's
[49:29] business
[49:30] amen and when he passes the training
[49:34] amen that he's ready Amen to get his
[49:37] white robe
[49:40] oh you have been get the ring on his
[49:43] finger
[49:44] amen that he can do the business
[49:47] take over the business amen so what
[49:51] happens to you amen if you uh don't
[49:54] understand your tutorship don't
[49:57] understand the teacher what he's trying
[50:00] to train you and teach you
[50:03] amen you were never coming to adoption
[50:06] because you don't understand the way God
[50:09] is leading you and why you go through
[50:12] such trials and tribulations that God is
[50:15] bringing you into maturity
[50:18] Joseph didn't understand amen why his
[50:22] brothers treated him like they treated
[50:24] him amen but Joseph one day was going to
[50:27] be crowned
[50:30] amen
[50:31] so all of that you go through all of
[50:34] your trials all of your tests and all
[50:37] your tribulations amen about amen for a
[50:41] season it's but for a moment but it's
[50:46] not compared to the glory that shall be
[50:49] revealed in you
[50:51] amen praise God there is a crowning of
[50:56] your suffering and that is a glory to be
[51:00] revealed
[51:01] amen there's something we call adoption
[51:05] in the fullness of adoption takes us
[51:09] into the fullness of redemption
[51:12] the Redemption of our bodies
[51:15] God has a glorified body for you
[51:19] amen hallelujah lock unto his glorious
[51:23] body
[51:24] amen one day you'll have a glorified
[51:27] body
[51:28] one day he met oh you're suffering your
[51:32] pain all your Agony of this world would
[51:35] be over
[51:37] praise God but just let the oh
[51:40] coming into adoption
[51:43] it's coming into maturity
[51:46] now he said
[51:48] because you're Sons
[51:50] and I'm talking about
[51:52] not coming into a new family but because
[51:56] you are family
[51:58] amen
[52:00] he says not so much as a word of
[52:03] relationship as it is positioned
[52:08] we're not talking about just
[52:10] relationship
[52:11] but we're talking about your position
[52:15] are you with me
[52:17] see sometimes when we talk about
[52:19] adoption we're not just talking about
[52:22] your relationship as son because a lot
[52:24] of times we by relationship and by the
[52:27] blood of Jesus we have a relationship
[52:30] amen
[52:31] or when that's not talking about
[52:33] relationship because you are Sons
[52:37] amen you are Sons and Daughters of God
[52:40] by relationship amen by the blood of
[52:44] Jesus
[52:45] amen you are Sons and Daughters of God
[52:48] but what is your position
[52:51] adoption is the placing of the sun into
[52:55] their position
[52:57] on European
[52:59] so it's the placing of the Sun
[53:02] oh are you you're being positionally
[53:05] placed
[53:07] praise God and we cannot now Joshua
[53:10] carried the children over Jordan amen
[53:13] but each each one of the tribes had a
[53:17] place in the uh Canaan
[53:20] and Caleb recognized that his was the
[53:23] mountain and he said give me my
[53:25] mountains
[53:27] amen praise God that's my position
[53:30] that's my place
[53:31] not to lie amen and so forth they had a
[53:35] place by the Sea course or whatever and
[53:37] that was their position amen God blesses
[53:40] you in your position
[53:43] praise God God will bless you and we
[53:46] know that that the Bride is a whole amen
[53:48] God bless Israel in her Homeland and
[53:51] when the Jews went back in 1946 and 48
[53:56] that they would begin to build
[53:58] recognized by the U.N and when they went
[54:00] back to Palestine and when they went
[54:02] back over there amen and reclaimed amen
[54:05] uh uh the Jerusalem and began to fly to
[54:09] the flag and it was recognized as a
[54:11] nation again after over 270 2000 and
[54:14] some years amen so amen God Amen it was
[54:19] signifying that Gentile time is getting
[54:22] ready to come to an end
[54:25] but it's been by the grace of God that
[54:27] the Gentiles time did not end then and
[54:31] it hasn't end as of yet God's still
[54:34] having a a little space a little cease
[54:37] now amen praise God and because of the
[54:42] Jews had been scattered abroad and come
[54:44] back to Jerusalem God is saying amen
[54:47] when you see amen these things happen
[54:51] then look up because your Redemption
[54:54] draws not
[54:55] are you up man
[54:57] when you see amen
[54:59] the Fig Tree began to Bud amen
[55:02] and we saw the Fig Tree we saw eildra
[55:05] back in a home lab amen and that
[55:08] signifies you better get in your
[55:10] Homeland and the Homeland uh the
[55:13] Gentiles is to come back to the word
[55:16] amen praise God your Homeland he said if
[55:20] your abide in me and my word abide in
[55:22] you
[55:23] that's your Homeland the word
[55:25] praise God so the word of God is where
[55:28] you are to be positionally
[55:31] but once you uh save and in Christ Jesus
[55:35] there is a position that God has ordered
[55:39] and foreign for your life
[55:42] that you can only be blessed in your
[55:46] position
[55:47] are you up there
[55:49] but if you don't understand and there's
[55:52] no growth and there's no maturity and
[55:55] there's nothing but coming to church
[55:57] singing this shot it gets boring after a
[56:00] while
[56:01] you'll stop coming sometime you get lazy
[56:04] sometimes
[56:05] why because that's you you know you
[56:08] don't see any growth
[56:09] they make us nothing to stir you amen
[56:12] you don't see your purpose
[56:15] amen you must understand that there's a
[56:17] purpose for you God didn't save you for
[56:19] nothing
[56:21] amen God had a reason in mind
[56:24] God Amen hadn't no even a purpose and a
[56:27] need
[56:28] praise God that he had ordained for you
[56:32] before the foundation of the world of
[56:34] amen and God said I need you amen
[56:39] didn't think of herself as much but how
[56:42] do you know that you didn't come into
[56:43] the kingdom for such a time is this
[56:46] amen God is going to use you it may be
[56:49] in a small way amen and maybe in a
[56:52] larger way but God is going to use you
[56:55] as he ordained for you to be used
[56:59] but you must understand what I find out
[57:02] my purpose and I find out what my
[57:05] position is amen then God will flourish
[57:09] amen I I know that I have a
[57:13] responsibility to maintain amen this
[57:17] calling that God has called me with the
[57:20] Holy calling
[57:21] amen he called me out but he didn't they
[57:24] meant to call me into Christ and I have
[57:26] been called out for purpose
[57:29] amen God bought me amen out and God
[57:32] saved me for purpose
[57:34] God delivered me for a purpose he
[57:38] redeemed me for a purpose I have a
[57:41] purpose Lord Lord let the Holy Ghost
[57:44] Joshua Place me into my
[57:48] position
[57:50] amen the Holy Ghost is going to place
[57:52] you in your position but you got to be
[57:54] humble
[57:56] you got to allow the holy spirit amen
[57:59] when he's dealing with you knowing that
[58:02] God knows what he's doing
[58:04] praise God don't be uh amen rebellious
[58:08] and amen just say Lord amen not my will
[58:12] but yours be done
[58:15] Jesus so please God let me let me get
[58:18] here
[58:19] the Holy Spirit now realized that they
[58:22] were Sons
[58:24] he said because your sons God is sent
[58:27] forth the spirit of the son into your
[58:29] heart
[58:30] crying of our father
[58:35] wherefore thou are no more
[58:38] Galatians
[58:40] 4-7 he said well for thou no more a
[58:44] servant but a son and if a son then
[58:46] you're what
[58:48] the ear of God through Christ
[58:51] amen
[58:56] now
[58:59] if you if you don't understand who you
[59:02] are
[59:03] as a Christian I take it from two
[59:06] standpoints and two perspectives
[59:08] I talked to you as going into adoption
[59:11] I'm talking to you as a a as those that
[59:15] need to understand
[59:17] amen that you are not under bondage when
[59:20] you accept Jesus Christ whom the son is
[59:23] set free as free indeed
[59:25] but I'm talking to those that need to go
[59:27] into the adoption that God is looking
[59:30] for maturity out of you
[59:31] and I'm talking to the others that you
[59:34] need to be born again and you need Jesus
[59:36] Christ and amen because God has a
[59:38] purpose for your life and you need to
[59:40] accept Jesus Christ and his will and his
[59:42] purpose for your life
[59:44] if you haven't done that then you need
[59:46] to realize that God Amen didn't let you
[59:49] just come in this world just to live a
[59:51] life God had a purpose amen for you
[59:53] being born in this world
[59:55] and that purpose that you deserve your
[59:57] the Lord the one that made you and the
[59:59] one that allows you to get here
[1:00:02] and the one that wants to protect you
[1:00:04] wants to keep you wants to give your joy
[1:00:07] peace and happiness
[1:00:09] are you with me
[1:00:11] so let me go on because I'm dealing with
[1:00:13] adoption this is on another level for
[1:00:16] the for the Believers and uh because I
[1:00:19] don't want you to come into a stalemate
[1:00:25] is but I wanted you to come to a place
[1:00:28] that you can't move
[1:00:31] and you can't get nowhere are you with
[1:00:33] me
[1:00:35] so I don't want you to come to a place
[1:00:37] amen that the children are Israel they
[1:00:39] just came to a place that they just went
[1:00:41] round in circles and they just couldn't
[1:00:43] go into what God had for them
[1:00:48] the prophet of God was saying the
[1:00:50] trouble with Christians today they don't
[1:00:53] realize
[1:00:54] what is provided for them
[1:00:59] they don't realize what is provided for
[1:01:01] them many people doesn't realize the
[1:01:05] great glorious power that's provided for
[1:01:09] them
[1:01:11] they don't realize that
[1:01:13] and I and that's that's what it's all
[1:01:15] about they don't realize what's in store
[1:01:18] what it means
[1:01:20] he said coming into Jesus Christ is like
[1:01:22] walking into an arcade down here are a
[1:01:27] great department store
[1:01:30] if someone gives me a great department
[1:01:33] store down here in the arcade and told
[1:01:37] me this is all yours
[1:01:43] well
[1:01:44] the first thing I'll do is I'll I I want
[1:01:47] to walk around in there and find out
[1:01:52] what I own
[1:01:55] you know people get in church and they
[1:01:57] just uh well I'm saying they don't want
[1:02:00] to know what they own
[1:02:02] it then I mean it's just
[1:02:04] you just want to clap man it becomes a
[1:02:06] traditional thing and you don't want to
[1:02:09] investigate you don't really you know
[1:02:11] you're alone search don't search up The
[1:02:13] Riches of Christ you don't want to
[1:02:14] really uh oh God
[1:02:17] all those blessings everything that's in
[1:02:20] store what do I have in the crisis when
[1:02:23] you save me God what did that mean or
[1:02:26] what what is it oh Lord
[1:02:30] see a lot of times when you're satisfied
[1:02:32] well uh well I own this and this is mine
[1:02:36] amen God has I mean far more that which
[1:02:41] we can actually think
[1:02:43] amen God got so much uh as being a
[1:02:46] Believer and being a Christian God got
[1:02:49] so much for you
[1:02:50] there's so many benefits there's so many
[1:02:53] blessings so many things
[1:02:56] that's why Paul said eyes have not seen
[1:02:58] him not heard neither have entered into
[1:03:01] the heart of man the things that God has
[1:03:04] prepared for them to love him
[1:03:08] see God everybody God wants to bring you
[1:03:11] into adoption bring you into that place
[1:03:14] that he can take you to the amen the
[1:03:17] arcade he can take you to the store and
[1:03:19] said all of it is yours amen
[1:03:22] praise God it's yours
[1:03:25] but the problem is we have a problem
[1:03:29] it's mine and
[1:03:32] and that's the way it is in Christ
[1:03:35] when you become a Christian walk around
[1:03:38] and find out what you own
[1:03:41] what's yours
[1:03:43] all things are yours
[1:03:46] given to you freely
[1:03:49] everything that Christ died for is yours
[1:03:53] everything that Christ died is yours
[1:03:57] and you say I don't want it it's my it's
[1:04:00] yours
[1:04:01] see yeah yeah
[1:04:04] you know how it is
[1:04:06] yeah yeah I heard that before
[1:04:09] but you don't believe it
[1:04:15] you don't believe it's yours
[1:04:17] oh you say healing is mine you said amen
[1:04:21] God said all my needs are supplied I I
[1:04:25] quoted it and I I say it but is it mine
[1:04:30] you know
[1:04:33] the prophet of God says
[1:04:36] we don't realize the power that we have
[1:04:40] he said
[1:04:42] it's all held down with the harness
[1:04:45] we put a harness on all the power that
[1:04:48] God has given us it's a harness on it
[1:04:52] and that heart is it called unbleek
[1:04:56] the hardest of unbelief the reason why
[1:04:59] the power amen is not being released
[1:05:02] because you don't have faith to release
[1:05:05] the power
[1:05:07] to walk into Power I said God you know I
[1:05:10] want to walk into power
[1:05:11] God I want that I want to manifest that
[1:05:15] power Lord I want to take advantage of
[1:05:17] what you gave me
[1:05:19] Hallelujah I said I may have not in time
[1:05:22] passed but God let me take advantage
[1:05:26] Glory I started feeling good
[1:05:29] because I start feeling something down

[1:06:05] and I'm right here and being stressed

[1:19:34] that was Bubba nephew Jonathan's
[1:19:37] favorite song I don't want to peanut
[1:19:38] butter and jelly
[1:19:44] see
[1:19:45] that's what it is
[1:19:47] we don't
[1:19:49] want to become independent
[1:19:51] we want to be dependent all the time
[1:19:55] but this Rapture is an independent thing
[1:19:58] to be in the bed one be taken the other
[1:20:00] left two I mean if you want to be taken
[1:20:01] the other left
[1:20:03] are you with me
[1:20:05] so it's an independent thing
[1:20:08] can't
[1:20:10] depend on anybody but you and God
[1:20:15] your walk is between you and God it's an
[1:20:19] individual thing it's not a family thing
[1:20:21] is not a church thing
[1:20:23] it's an independent thing
[1:20:26] amen God has he's called you and you
[1:20:30] must know what is the hope of your
[1:20:31] calling
[1:20:33] that you got to be independently LED by
[1:20:36] his spirit
[1:20:38] and the way God takes you it's for you
[1:20:42] are you with me
[1:20:44] so
[1:20:46] we're afraid
[1:20:47] if I to be alone
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:51] you're afraid to be by yourself
[1:20:55] I'm afraid
[1:20:57] he's gonna leave me
[1:21:00] it's an independent thing
[1:21:02] you got to know when it comes down to
[1:21:04] you in Christ and your salvation is not
[1:21:06] depend and hinged upon others
[1:21:09] is your faith
[1:21:11] we talk about coming in maturity it's
[1:21:13] your faith in God
[1:21:15] praise God if you don't have a prayer
[1:21:17] life it's not dependent on whether or
[1:21:20] not
[1:21:21] we have family prayer
[1:21:23] if family don't pray I gotta pray
[1:21:26] are you with me if nobody in the
[1:21:29] restaurant blesses their food I'm a
[1:21:31] blessed mind
[1:21:33] amen I'm not ashamed in the schoolhouse
[1:21:36] to let everybody know I'm a Christian
[1:21:39] praise God
[1:21:40] but when we ashamed of him he'll be
[1:21:42] ashamed of us
[1:21:44] are you with me
[1:21:46] but sometimes we'll shame to make a
[1:21:48] stand for Jesus because we still have
[1:21:50] babies
[1:21:51] we're still battling within our minds
[1:21:53] whether or not I'm truly it's just what
[1:21:56] I really want to be do I really want to
[1:21:58] be a child of God or
[1:22:00] am I a Dane or am I predestinated am I
[1:22:04] meant to be a Christian
[1:22:09] I don't fully understand it I don't
[1:22:11] fully know if if this kind of life is
[1:22:15] meant for me
[1:22:18] it's nothing but two kind of lives that
[1:22:21] you can live for God or for the devil
[1:22:24] and if if this ain't for you then what
[1:22:26] is
[1:22:28] sometimes we look at a church
[1:22:31] and we look at how people dress how
[1:22:33] people look how people talk and then it
[1:22:36] kind of life for me I want to be here I
[1:22:38] want to curse a little drink a little do
[1:22:40] this
[1:22:42] they say it ain't for me
[1:22:44] but there's a deep calling to the Deep
[1:22:47] and that's a hung in and there's a
[1:22:49] thirst for God but you don't know how to
[1:22:51] quench The Thirst
[1:22:54] and when there's a thirst for God then
[1:22:56] you got to realize who am I going to
[1:22:58] please myself or my friends or my
[1:23:00] neighbors
[1:23:01] but truly if I be honest
[1:23:03] amen I want I want to be a child of God
[1:23:07] I want to go to heaven I want to love
[1:23:09] that I I want to serve the Lord
[1:23:11] but that's got to be a desire in you
[1:23:13] somewhere down inside you that you know
[1:23:16] is real that that's my desire
[1:23:18] I don't want to be like that person
[1:23:20] that's throwing their life away and
[1:23:22] drinking and doing all kind of stuff I
[1:23:26] don't want to throw my life away
[1:23:28] there's a deep caller to the deep and
[1:23:30] there's a Desiring me to please him
[1:23:32] and that's what I want
[1:23:34] but the only way I'm gonna get it I got
[1:23:36] to take the harness off
[1:23:38] are you with me and that harness is
[1:23:41] unbelief I got to believe God I gotta
[1:23:42] trust God I got to know it's for me
[1:23:45] amen peer pressure and all kind of
[1:23:48] pressure and family pressure every kind
[1:23:50] of pressure but that's that's thank God
[1:23:53] I got to take the harness off I got to
[1:23:55] believe that God has ordained a path for
[1:23:57] me to walk
[1:23:58] and it's straight and it's narrow but
[1:24:00] that's what he'll think for me
[1:24:02] and if if I go that path God's going to
[1:24:04] be with me
[1:24:06] and he'll never leave me I'll never be
[1:24:08] alone
[1:24:09] are you with me
[1:24:12] amen I gotta try to get this and then I
[1:24:15] close the Lord's will
[1:24:17] um Matthew 17-1
[1:24:20] God is good amen you love him
[1:24:23] do you really love you
[1:24:25] somebody said I'm scared to say it
[1:24:28] because
[1:24:30] you know I looked at some people's mouth
[1:24:31] they're scared to open it and say I love
[1:24:34] you
[1:24:35] you don't have to say it to please me
[1:24:38] amen but it's all right to say Lord I
[1:24:40] love you
[1:24:42] you know I'm not ashamed of tell him I
[1:24:44] love him
[1:24:46] I'm not saying it because the preacher
[1:24:48] tell me they said but I'd really love
[1:24:49] the Lord
[1:24:51] amen
[1:24:52] go ahead
[1:24:54] and after six days Jesus take him Peter
[1:24:57] James and John his brother and bringeth
[1:25:00] them up into a high mountain apart
[1:25:03] and was transfigured before them and his
[1:25:05] face did Shone as the sun and his Rhema
[1:25:08] was white as the light and behold there
[1:25:11] appeared unto them Moses and Elijah
[1:25:13] talking with him then answer Peter and
[1:25:16] said unto Jesus what the prophet said
[1:25:18] before the Rapture take place
[1:25:20] like it was in the first resurrection
[1:25:22] when Jesus rose the Saints of old got up
