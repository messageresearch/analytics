straight in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exhorted and every mountain shall and heal shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough place is plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord has spoken it the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh is grass and all the goodness thereof is as the flowers of the field the grass with the flowers faded because the spirit of the lord blew it upon it surely the people is grass and the grass where the the flower was faded but the word of god shall stand god bless the readers you may be seated the word of god should stand amen and i want to just talk to you a little bit about he saw you coming god saw you coming he saw you coming and because he saw you coming he prepared a way for you god saw you coming and because he saw you coming he prepared a way for you now in the book of hebrews 7. god saw you coming and he prepared a way for you maybe i'll just talk to you a little bit this morning i don't know if i preach or not but he saw you coming amen god knew your steps are numbered your bounds you cannot pass we like to thank the lord for all the graduates god bless you and we just thank god for you achieving your course amen and when you go on to do great things for the lord and accomplish the goals that you're set out to do amen god bless you he says hebrews 7 and 9 it says and excuse me and i like to say um um i thank you all for reaching out to us concerning our brother robert passed away and it's brother from sumpter and he's they asked to have the funeral here so we're accommodating the family it's a possibility to be saturday at 11. so you should pray for the simmons family thank you for reaching out okay as we go a little further he says in the ninth verse he says as many and as i may say levi also who received tithes paid tithes in abraham now this is the catch to it for he was yet in the lungs of his father when metcasade met him now he hadn't been born yet but he paid tithes and this is just uh uh showing you that they meant what abraham did it was reckoned to levi levi did it and that takes me back to realize uh he saw you coming and because god saw you coming he prepared a way for you here in revelation 13 8 god saw you coming and because he saw you coming he prepared a way for you now it's not to everyone the bible says in revelation he that has an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit says to the church if you got an ear to hear you can hear but if you don't have an ear to hear it doesn't you cannot hear amen but he that has an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit says to the church i said he saw you coming and you must take it personal as they said it's a personal experience so you as an individual must take the word of god personally that god was able to see you coming before you were ever born in the world god said jeremiah i saw you and i ordained you to be a prophet to the nations isn't that right so before jeremiah was ever in his mother's womb god had already saw him and already ordained him to be a prophet are you with me if god can see the bible says that god knows the end from the beginning and god knew all about you he knew how many halves would be on your head because of the numbers of your head you know the numbers of the sand of the seashore then god knows everything amen god saw you come in amen he knew that you would be here in 2021 god saw you there he saw you sitting here this morning and he saw amen that you would be here for a divine purpose and providence had its course and brought you this fall he saw you there god saw you that's why job said our steps are numbered our bounds we cannot pass amen in job 14 amen he began to tell you that god determines our steps and our bounds we cannot pass amen so god determined amen let me just of 13 and 8 i was talking to one of my niece and i was telling her amen that god amen it's nothing new to god god before the foundation of the world knew amen god does not you can't make god any more intelligent amen he don't have to get smarter amen as he grows god already knows all things amen and god knew you he knew you were coming and he prepared a way for you thirteen and eight it says and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him now it's no getting away around it we're talking about the mark of the beast and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him now there's one exclusion you amen to dwell on the earth are you all right this morning ain't god good do you love him this morning amen will you worship him is he worth worshiping amen is he worth giving praise amen somebody said when i think about the goodness of jesus and all that he's done for me my soul cried out hallelujah and i thank god for saving me oh yes amen it got to be a praise in you amen nothing should stop your praise nobody can handle you from praising god praise god that's what we come to church for amen we enter into his courts with thanksgiving and i mean in the gates of thanksgiving unto his courts with praise amen if we don't have a praise we're in the wrong place isn't that right praise god because we come amen to praise the lord praise god we got any other purpose amen we're in the wrong place praise god you don't go to the grocery store just to look around you go there to get something you don't go pull up to the gas pump just to look at it amen you come to get some gas isn't that right so when you come to uh in god's house you come to praise him we come to give god praise because he's worthy of it praise god [Applause] you know it's something to be a spectator and something to be that you you out there playing ball praise god i i didn't like i i i i'm so glad that i wasn't a warmer somebody that just sitting on there waiting on their time to play amen i uh you know it's something about those that just won the bench and hoping and waiting amen but it's something about those that have been proven and testing and they out there on the field praise god they know what they are they're doing well what they're out there for but those others are they waiting on their time to come praise god this is your time and your season you ought to know what to do amen you ought to know why you're here praise god you're here to praise god okay 13-8 and he says and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him it looks like it was including all but he says he's he says this is the all that i'm talking about whose names or what revelation 13 today whose names that are not what do y'all see that so it's no exclusion if your name is not written there amen then god saw that too isn't that right but i'm talking to the sanctuary god to the bride of jesus christ that god saw you coming amen and he prepared a way for you god provide a way of the prophet god said for this day he prepared god provided way for this day are you with me so god has prepared a way for you for this day praise god and god knew you needed amen a way made for you for this day not for another day but for this day but this is the day the lord has made i will rejoice and be glad in it you needed a word for this thing come on somebody noah had a word for his day moses had a word for his day but you needed a word for this thing are you with me praise god somebody's think amen god forgot about us but he didn't forget about this day he knew this day would come and you needed a word in season for the hour that you live in okay says whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb amen see one thing about it god was intelligent enough that he knew all things that he could write your name not when you got saved not when you accept accepted him as your lord and savior but god was so intelligent before you even accepted god to be your lord and savior he signed your name he put your name in the lamb book are you up there somebody said i know i know that my name is written there praise god do you know amen that your name is written there in the lamb book of life flame before when from the what foundation of the world are you with me there's something about god seeing you coming and he said the lamb was slain in the mind of god so it says in first peter 1 first peter 1 amen and god saw you there amen 1 and 18 it's something about god had a plan for you amen you see you know you just a lot a lot of parents just don't get pregnant by accident amen they want to have a baby so they plan for it god amen he pre-planned amen he made a plan he made provision for you because he knew you was what he knew you was coming god knew you was coming he knew amen who you would be what your name was and god planned for you there's not no uh planned parenthood or whatever they call it but god planned for you to be here amen somebody could have aborted you somebody they could have killed you while you were uh uh just in the mother's womb somebody could have decided i don't want you i just tell you what i'll kill you i'll i'll abort you i'll go get an abortion but you know that many amen to god amen in the black community through abortion because the preacher failed to preach the gospel and there are many that come they meant that wasn't planned on and they didn't plan through marriage amen but through uh uh fornication amen they got here they met and they were born under adverse circumstances because amen they did not plan properly amen but god saw you in the mind of god amen and that child becomes a victim of circumstances mama over here daddy over there or somewhere [Music] are you with me but god don't make a mess of things amen somebody said where's your daddy i don't know why is your mama i don't know are you with me but god saw you coming and he made preparation for you to get here oh you're with me so god pre-planned your destiny amen because he knew what kind of heart out of all the mistakes and all the stuff you've done wrong god still knew you you can say god i'm sorry i'm sorry the devil will keep whipping you and whipping you for everything you ever done the devil will beat you up make you feel like you're nothing and caused you to take a drink you got the devil whipping you so bad you said i i can't live with myself i can't even stand to see myself amen because of the stuff that i've done but god amen he saw all that the devil deceived you and all that stuff the devil put on you but god still forgave you are you with me he still said i love you in spite of that in spite of all you've done i still love you he saw all your mistakes and i know there's nobody in here that sound free of mistakes amen because we all have sin it comes short of the glory of god there's nobody here that's so perfect that they've done nothing wrong amen we're born in sin shaping an iniquity thank god for his grace and mercy today amen for without it why would it be so by the grace of god at first peter uh 1 and 18 he says for as much as you know that ye were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by the tradition of your fathers it don't matter somebody told me just a while ago that uh my mama was a baptist my daddy was a baptist so i was inviting him out to church and he said well you know my mama was the baptist my daddy was a baptist i'm looking for a church but you know i ain't got nothing against the pentecostal people well uh my mama was about to daddy was the baptist that i reckon i'd be a baptist i said well you get an opportunity to come by and visit us anyhow praise god isn't that right i said i remember my mama said my mama was the baptist right mama was a baptist and i'd be a baptist well something got a hold to it one day she didn't worry about the baptist no more she just wanted god she wanted that baptism of the holy ghost so forget about who what mama was and grandmother was i need jesus i need the holy ghost she forgot about what my aunt was witnessing her about being baptized in water in the name of jesus christ and receiving the baptism of the holy ghost amen she had to forget about that grandmama and mama and all the latin she had to do what the word tradition vain traditions amen praise god we got to see what the words say about it even one day she came to grips with the word and obama followed the word praise god and after being praised god in a certain persuasion one day we came and showers so that god had to provide a way for this day and she said i have to leave even there to come for what god has provided for us in this day praise god at the evening time there shall be light and oh god so as you see the light you shouldn't walk in it for the path of the justice that the shining light was shining more and more to the perfect day as you see the word you begin to walk in the word amen you you just can't say well i'm gonna stop as you see the light keep walking in the light while you have the light walk in the light praise god uh mama what mama's going oh grandma uh-uh well you see the word walk in the word okay it says here okay but in the 19th verse but with the precious blood of christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot don't that sound like somebody else the church that without spot rank or blemish or any such thing but this lamb that was slain the reason why the church could be amen a church without spot without blemish without amen the reason why the church could be like that is because somebody prepared the way that the church could be like that are you with me the church could be not be without spot without blemish amen except somebody except the lamb was slain without the lamb being saved praise god there is no redemption without the shelling of blood there is no remission of sin except jesus had died we would not have a way to get to god but jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man can come to the father but by me brother and sister that's a way to amen that god has provided for this day amen praise god and then he says here he says that the lamb without spot i mean without blemish and without spot who verily was what 20 verse who verily was what for ordain now god started all this in the mind of god slain before the foundation of the world so all of this was done now after it was done peter was speaking of it and he's trying to tell you amen this just didn't start when jesus came and died on the cross it was already done in the mind of god before the foundation of the world amen you just didn't know amen that you were sons and daughters of god you didn't know that then because you didn't come into beings amen you only thought you were only a seed leave i was only a gene seed amen in abraham but one day levi was going to be born amen so god in abraham paying tithe to mecca deck amen wrecking it and to on leave our behalf and because what jesus did 2000 years ago when he died for our sin he reckoned it on your behalf your father took care of you he made proficient for you hey god hallelujah somebody can leave you a million dollars somebody can leave you a billion dollars but he let you eternal life praise god in inheritance and inheritance that faded not away oh i'm so glad that jesus thought about me he made provision for me brother friend he made proficient for me he knew i was coming he saw you come in praise god and he prepared away amen he made a way somebody said jesus made a way thank god for him making a way he knew how to do all kind of stupid stuff and he knew i would be all messed up but he made a way praise god oh god saw us there saw us ain't been making the wrong decisions doing all kind of stuff that we're ashamed of but god's still rich in mercy he still loved us he stood right down waited for you to come to your senses to come to yourself oh hallelujah one day the prodigal son came to himself and i'm saying god is waiting on you to come to yourself ain't meant to recognize amen your true identity praise god when you're going through identity crisis amen when you're not sure amen that god loves you and he's your father and you're not certain amen but one day it matters hey man just get in a place say that god i really want to know amen i really want to feel the i really want you to express your love and kindness and your tender message god i want to know your father if i'm your son or i'm your daughter the lord accept me lord amen i need you now i need your power i need your god i need a touch oh god i need an experience amen praise god amen uh before paul met him he was just saul of tasha amen he was the pharisee of the fire season praise god i i'm just uh i'm just a a methodist i'm just a baptist i'm just a just something just a church goal amen paul thought he had a nade i i i i and on the assault on his way lying to the masters amen he didn't know the law but he thought he'd do it because he knew the stretcher's back was in false and he thought he knew the law but one day amen on his way to the masters to persecute those amen amen and he fell to the earth he saw a light praise god i hope you see the light this morning he saw light shining praise god i'm glad i saw the light the light that god said amen would lead us in the way of righteousness amen i'm so glad that john when he was baptized on jordan when jesus stepped out to amen i believe john saw it met the holy ghost descending in the bottomless shape of of a dove he said behold the lamb of god was coming to take away the sins of the world amen i i i i i know that god spoke amen from heaven and said this is my love son in whom i'm pleased to dwell amen god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself amen i want you to know something happened at jordan river they made something happen on the road to the masters amen god saw amen song with all the stuff that he done murdering uh all that he had done to the people of god but god rich in mercy still loved him still chose him for specific person say you say what can i do for the lord saying that my life is a shipwreck scene that i've made a mess of things but god still saw you he saw you there praise god amen until you come in grips with that word and that word energize your faith that word began to mean something to you it's just not something that you're just hearing amen but something that they were to take amen root in you amen and begin to manifest itself throughout your life amen that word amen praise god we're not here amen to become buddies and friends we're here amen becomes amen praise god that god want to build you up until you come into the statue of a perfect man that's what we're here for amen we're not here ain't meant to for to get pat's on the back and and folk tell you how much they love you how much they care about you amen they can love you today and hate you tomorrow they can say amen you my friend today and they can talk about you behind your back they can say you're my pastor and you're my preacher and then at the same time they can stab you are you up man oh that don't make a difference we're here for the word we're here for god isn't that right we're here again that god can hang us our faith in him oh yes praise god i hope folk are looking for jesus and he is the word if you're looking for jesus you'll find him in his word because christ is revealing his own word praise god you don't get nothing but jesus that's all you want i want jesus what you want i want jesus what you want he's the word amen the bible say hey he was in the world the world was made by me the world did not recognize who he was and the bible tells us in the word was made flesh and dwelt among us are you with me if you want the word then jesus christ is the word praise god amen and that's what we want we want a man to not live by bread alone but by what every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god god we want you i don't know what folk looking for but i want to worry amen i don't know what folk want but i want to worry give me the word give me jesus that's what i want i want jesus hallelujah you may have the whole wide world but give me jesus i want jesus and he's the word now who verily was foreign before the foundation of the world but was manifested in these last times for who for who that's why i say he saw you the reason why jesus came he came to prepare a way for you for you when you come before god jesus christ said i've already prayed to christ amen because you stood for jesus and you accepted what he'd done amen brother and sister don't worry about the thing the price has already been paid amen he already shedded his blood he already died for you praise god and you ought to praise him because it's already done hallelujah ain't god good amen who wouldn't serve a god like this a god that makes it so plain a god ah he judges oh he did it for me jesus did it for me praise god he said who the last times for you the 21st verse says by him who do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be well in the church in the preacher your faith and hope might be where that's where god wants your faith and hope to be in god not in the church not in the preacher but in god praise god amen paul said we well we don't preach ourselves but jesus christ the lord and ourselves your servant for christ's sake amen and that's what it's all about it's jesus christ and you don't have to see me you have to see jesus and in the last day amen it's jesus christ amen that you will stand before him and he'll say well done amen i don't care it doesn't matter what the church said what the preacher said well you want to hear him say well done good and faithful servant amen you've been faithful amen to him not to the church not to the preacher but to jesus christ are you up man it's very important because you got a lot of people faithful to the preacher and faithful to the church but they're not faithful to the word amen he made a way amen i thank god made a way for us amen i i i try to finish but the time will fail me amen that your hope might be in god sin you have purified your soul and obeying the truth you can obey the church and you can obey the preacher but it's another thing to obey the truth you should know the truth and the truth what make you free praise god thank god for the message of the hour it's just not something we just talk about and reading about and poking about amen it's the truth praise god a lot of folk get to them and just identify them with some words but there's no manifestation in their lives are you wiping they can't live nothing [Music] all they're doing is identifying with something but they themselves amen don't have the identification in themselves are you with me hey there has not the spirit of god he's none of his are you with me you need the holy ghost to be something daughter to god amen praise god they that are led by the spirit of god they are the what sons of god amen the spirit gonna lead you the way the word is where the caucus is that where the eagles be gathered amen but a lot of folks they're just being led by their own spirit not by the spirit of god i feel led led what praise god you got to be led by the spirit the spirit leads you to what truth all truth amen not just for all truth amen thank god we got amen praise god the truth is the word of god praise god he said the spirit obeying through the spirit or to unfriend love of the brethren amen if you don't love your brother then you know something wrong seeing that you love see that you what love what somebody say i love them but i hate them at the same time i just tell you i love him but but uh i i got trouble with you got to love your enemies that's just to say about saying he's a good what adversary she didn't have nothing bad to say about the devil said the devil is a good adversary are you with me so by the grace of god you got to be careful how you talk about the devil the devil hear you and god will let the devil loose on you to give you a good weapon talking about the devil and you praise god you're living for the devil people out there doing all kind of crazy stuff and then they talk about that they never can't do me no harm yeah you can't do your homie you already got you are you with me praise god so what what happens amen when god is in you amen god sanctified purify your soul god cleans you up are you with me well you got all kind of stuff that is permitted in church and all kind of preachers and all kind of mess going on and folk tomorrow i go to the songs on church you better go to the club you go to the nightclub listen you know you're where you're going low houston being blind in the sea with folk fooling you and he could say ah i see my mother in heaven come on we just uh going by good sign oh catch off the smearing same spirit that was in the nightclub why because it's not speaking concerning the law it's not speaking concerning the word of god then there's no light in them are you with me let me just go ahead and i didn't i didn't mean to do that y'all forgive me this morning god help us amen ain't god good we got to get down to business and know that we have a personal relationship with jesus christ and that means everything if we don't know god then what good his church gonna do us if we don't really have that relationship with god amen it doesn't matter what mama got what daddy got but do you have it okay seeing that you see that you love one another with the pure heart fervently come on if you can't love with a pure heart then it's something wrong praise god you got to love one another with a pure heart you know it's got to be pure it's got to be clean you can't uh i can't stand them i put up with them because god said love your enemy god said love everybody god come on that's just a persona that's just a bad word something that people practice saying but love got to be without dissimilation love got to be without partiality amen god's love is not i love this one i hate that when i despise that one you got to love everybody praise god regardless of what they say about you regardless what they do to you you still got to love them are you with me well i can love them from a distance go ahead on love them from a distance praise god you know it's strange how people can put up with unsaved loved ones no matter how raunchy they are no matter what they do you let the church members just look at them hardly they almost gonna have a heart attack and a fit family member cuss them out tell them i you know i don't like you you're my brother that's my cousin they love them right on they get in the knee they run to the rescue and try to see about them and they're right but when it comes down to why can't god people love one another like that i don't know the devil is the author of that kind of love the kind of love that's only gonna love those that you want to love do for those that do for you or that you respect something you receive oh you look man i'm talking about god saw you coming he knew what we would be up against in this hour and he knew that we needed perfect love to go beyond the curtains of time he knew you need that amen so god made provision through the preaching of the word that we are are called to a higher standard than that of the world then that other system of the amen just going to church in tradition we're called to a higher standard we're called to be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen praise god you the love in spite of not because you say you love because your man your actions speak louder than your words are you what man when you act like amen your actions speak louder than your words come on praise god i can see people go head over shoulder a family member ain't done nothing for them and they plan on doing nothing for them to let something happen to them man they go head over shoulder to do for them a lot of brother or sister that that uh that said something to them they look at me hard i don't think they care about me what are we looking oh come on brother now don't you see the difference i just the devil working among the people trying to divide the people up oh you're a man so it's folks are so sensitive when it comes down to the church but it comes down to their natural family they all had over shoulder with that oh they don't see no fault the prophet god said if you're looking for a fault you'll find it he said you get what you you get what you expect isn't that right so whatever you look for that's what you'll see amen and so he says with the pure heart firmly being what born again i know everybody quiet being born again what now if you were really born again amen you're born again not of what amen come on i'm talking about uh god pay love i'm talking about being born again amen he saw you coming he knew what you need he met brother watson he saw you coming he knew what you need amen you need perfect love you got to forgive i don't care what they've done to you i don't care what you've been through you still got to love them praise god why but you can't do it except you what born again if you ain't born again amen i'm telling you you can try harder you can to love somebody they may have done done you wrong and you know how oh you can try to love them but it's hard you need something else you need you need god to forgive them from the heart to really not hold it against them to do good to them when they're done you're wrong praise god thank god for joseph joseph went through some of the brothers amen amen but god saw where joseph was going and god told joseph one day your father mother your brother's gonna bow down to you are you what man god amen will take care of you i gotta close with this one scripture let me close second timothy 2 19. second timothy 2 19. amen god is good amen i i i i it's something about where you're going brother and sister when you're going to heaven god make preparation for you to go there my old bishop said god prepare you got to prepare to go to heaven god prepared a place for you and you got to prepare to go to heaven are you with me so god prepares a place for you and you prepare to go away god to that place that he's prepared for you are you with me if you don't prepare for heaven you'll never get there amen and god gave you everything you need to get there amen the bible said he prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointed my head with the lord my cup running over surely goodness and mercy so follow me all the days of my life god know how to prepare a table before you god know how to take care of you he prepared the way he knew what way you would take and god said i'm gonna i'm gonna look out for you on every hand i don't care what folks do until you say to you i i'm gonna get you where you need to be nobody no weapon that'll form against you going to prosper i'm gonna get you where you need to be praise god if you've got to get thrown in prison joseph if you got to do this amen if they're going part of a wife got to lie on you amen i'm taking you to the throne praise god you're going to rule amen because that's why but i'm getting ready for rulership david i don't care how many spirits saw throw at your head i don't care how many times he tried to kill you but you're gonna get to the throne david because just god preparing you amen because he know uh amen power without character is satanic so god prepares you amen for the throne to be kings and priests god has to prepare you because one day you're gonna reign with him a thousand years you're gonna judge the world and god is preparing you to be know how to judge a judge has to go through something amen and prove himself amen amen so god is preparing you and i amen and whether or not we are passing the test that's up between how you handle the situation and the obstacles that come before you in life these children that are a graduate same and many of them are graduating from high school but through uh the 12 years of school they met they were preparing amen aiming for college and for life and how they can conduct themselves so it was a preparation time and you know how well they took heed amen it may determine how successful they're going to be in life in this world amen and how amen the fivefold ministry come from all over the world to minister here at the church amen to prepare you for heaven amen and god one man can't do it all but the fivefold ministry god gives they meant some apostles some prophets some pastor some teachers some in fact evangelistic son passes and teaches amen so god takes the ministry to perfect you to strengthen you to bring you into that position in that place amen that when you amen when he come back he'll find you ready amen so uh ii timothy 2 and 19. he said nevertheless the what foundation of god standing what uh don't you don't you know god don't make no mistakes when he put your name on the lamb book of life in revelation 13-8 when he put your name there he didn't make a mistake amen and you must recognize that amen that i god is my father and i i'm a son and i'm a daughter of god not because i heard my sheep hear my voice because i heard the voice of my god he said no man can come to me except the father was in heaven drawing and god draws you amen through a holy calling god calls you be holy for i am holy amen for this cause i sanctify myself amen that you might be also sanctified sanctify them through thy word that word is truth so god wants to sanctify you god wants you to clean your life up if you allow him to do that amen then you heard his voice amen he told saul it is hard to kick against the priest isn't that right you all know what duckies do the muse i mean excuse the mules do a lot of dunking but a mew it's a hybrid thing it'll kick you you got to watch out for that mule come on amen a mule kick you amen i remember the man used to come and apply the garden he had a mule strong right they'll work in the church they'll work hard but once they crossed up between a dunking and a horse they meant they ain't a horse and they're not a donkey there's a mule there's a hybrid thing and they can't re they can't bring forth life are you with me so no matter how hard folk they have new religion no matter how hard you can preach new i want you to act gentle like a horse no i want you to be a ducky mule can't be no duck can't be a duck and he can't be a horse he's a hybrid so people take the creeds and the dogmas and they mix it with the word and they got new religion they work hard work hard they're trying to work their way to heaven are you with me so some folk knock doors some folk they work hard in the church they on every board and everything they're working their way to heaven amen but the bible said we're saved by faith through grace not a work at least any man shall what boasts it is the gift of god amen somebody said because i do this because i do that if you did that there was no need that jesus being slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world it was because the blood of jesus christ that you saved then all that rest of this stuff amen and the reason why i lived this life amen i'm not living this life because i don't want to go to hell i'm living this life because of the life is in me are you with me praise god i don't love my wife because i'm afraid that she might uh run off and i'm gonna be faithful to her because if i don't be faithful to her she's gonna lead me and divulge me praise god i'm faithful to her because i love her and i don't do
