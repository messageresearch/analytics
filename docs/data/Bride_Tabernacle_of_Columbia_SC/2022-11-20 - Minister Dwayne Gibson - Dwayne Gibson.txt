praise the Lord let you determined us Amen to the Book of Matthew The Book of Matthew the fourth chapter let me begin after 17 verse from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand let us pray Lord God we have read your holy word now Lord it's in your hands do what you want to do with it in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated amen a call to repentance a call to repentance sometime you want to go you call for a preacher amen you don't know what he's going to preach but he got the preach what the law give him that's right you got to preach what God give you for the people because someone needs it praise God so he call to repentance this morning and you know it's something that we live in an age that you don't hear much about repentance anymore people just come to church and they worship but no repentance is called for and I believe now more than ever is a time of repentance we need to come to repentance before God you said Brother Gibson why are you saying we need to come to repentance because we do a lot of wrong sometime and never repent I said we do a lot of raw sometime and never repent we go on like nothing happened but I said the time now the call for repentions and people come to church and never repent to the Lord and never feel sorry for the thing they have done the things they have said and the things that they're doing so they never feel sorry for that they come to church and there's no repentance and sometimes that's why we can't see the power of God because God knows there's no repentance there's no repentance what does that word repent mean the means to uh feel deeply sorry for or wrong that you have done deeply sorrow uh uh Contrition for a wrong that you have done some sin some wrongdoing you have done you you call you you realize that you did it and then you repent from you feel sorry that you've done that amen people on this day they can do all kind of evil and won't repent come to church like they never did nothing wrong but there's a call for repentance this morning amen come repent before the law not before me but before the law why you got to repent because you must make you want to make Heaven your home amen the first principle of Christianity is what repent at the first principle when you come to God if Jesus can't preach and repent why because the kingdom of God in their hands that was the first message that Jesus preached on that was his first coming his first message was what repent now he wasn't talking to Sinners he was talking to religious people he was talking to his own people remember he came under his owners under what received him not he was not talking to the center right there he was talking to Israel because all people that supposed to worship him they're supposed to know him his first message was what repent why cook the kingdom of God is at hand that was his first coming now what about his second coming I believe the message is saying the same thing repent why because the kingdom of heaven where is at hand man see you can't change the message the message is the same rhyme God came the first time in the first coming preaching repentance amen at the second coming he's preaching the same thing repentance get right with God before it's too late get right make sure you all you write with God don't just come to church Amendment make sure you're right Jesus came preaching repented to those Jews because you know what they wasn't right very religious though come on somebody very religious most religious people upon the face of the Earth but they needed repentance they need to repent why because it wasn't right there they were worshiping God Jesus Jesus said that they worship Him in vain because they were teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men Jesus in vain you do worship me because they were teaching for doctrines to commandment of man so they worship wasn't even right in the sight of God what they was doing wasn't even right in the sight of God that was like Jesus came he came saying repent and people don't like to hear that word because a lot of people when you're telling repent the first thing with us they want to say I ain't did nothing I didn't do anything wrong what'd I do no you need to examine yourself amen praise God and see if he is doing something wrong no matter what it is Lord I want to repent I I want to come to repentance because I want my running to be invented I want to come to repentance amen amen and I want my repentance to be genuine a lot of people say to repent but there's no change John the Baptist can't preach and repentance he was the Forerunner of Christ he can't preach and repentance he said repent also know what you said bring forth fruits and meat for repent let me see something to show me that you repent let me see some fruit that you repent don't tell me you repent as doing the same thing let me see some fruits that you truly repented let me see you make a turn from what you're doing and do something else do something new do something God's way amen so John the Baptist came preaching repentance also he came with the baptism of repentance for that age to get the people ready to receive the Lord Jesus Christ that's right John was the first Forerunner of Christ he can't preach and repentance to that age getting the people ready for the Lord Jesus Christ to come amen hallelujah amen if God has done the same thing said a prophet amen sins and repent because the kingdom of God is in hand repent because the Lord is soon to come repent get ready to meet the Lord don't keep on doing the same things you're doing amen repent and get serious with God amen so as a call to repentance and I saw it and I just called a man the Lord said Lord you don't know what you're going to say how you're going to say it but you're trusting God to make it real you don't know what you're going to do how you're gonna say be trusting God to make it real to people see I need to repent I need to I need to repent on my ways that I'm doing it's not all right in the sight of God I want to think I'm all right I want to know about God's grace that I am all right uh if I need to repent Lord let me repent and there's nothing wrong with repentance Hallelujah I said there's nothing wrong with it amen it cleanses the soul it cleanses the spirit and nothing wrong with repentance amen if you can come to it it's good for your soul amen so repentance is good and that wrong saying Lord I'm sorry praise God now Ron was saying mama daddy I'm sorry sometimes you only repent to God you got to repent to one another oh Lord we find that very hard to do sometimes because a lot of times we don't even like the person we need to repent to but you got to get past that you got to get past that this morning you got to come to repentance Hallelujah you got to repent not only to God but you must repent to who one another who repent to who I don't even like them yeah you need you definitely need some repentance yeah you need some repentance this morning because you ain't got no love in you you ain't going nowhere anyway you got to have love in your heart now when you got love in your heart it'll bring you to repentance it'll cause you to repent when you got some love in your heart but if you don't have no love in your heart then you'll never be able to repent I'm driving to one another this morning you don't have no love for your brother or your sister how you ever repent to them you won't be able to do it but this morning Hallelujah God is calling for repentance repent of what you're wrong repent of the things you're not doing right repent amen for to be well with your soul in Jesus Christ's name amen is the fact of uh of saying that you are very sorry for something bad that you have done and that hurts sometimes but I'll tell you it's sometimes if you're not really humble it's hard to say that you're wrong because most of us want to be right it's hard sometimes to commit around the husband to the wife he got to confess he wrong sometime the wife got to confess to the husband I'm wrong sometime amen see but when you always want to be right you never can't say you're wrong you can't repent you can't paint from your wrong but you got to repent this morning amen amen everybody got to repent the children got to repent the husband the wife everybody got to repent this morning repent from your wrong Doom repent from what you're doing repent from your anger don't let anger rule your life get for get away from that kind of cry out to God lord I repent for another anger to try to take control of me to make me say and do things are not right you need to repent from that anger this morning that I ain't gonna get there again and grab controlling you and begin to make you say things and do things that's not right you need to repent but not not just say I want repent I'm sorry and do it again by the true repentance they mean the cause of cleansing to come inside your soul see repent from your anger there will do a lot of things to make us angry in the natural that we're going to have the spirit of Christ in you that today ain't going to overcome you you got to overcome the anger that's right so I anger sometime I get inside to try to come and get inside us and get advantage of us it may get abandoned to make us so angry that we say wrong things say wrong things to the children say wrong things to the wife say Rob think you're the husband why I was angry I was mad you need to repent this morning from your angry and you're mad don't let it rule your life don't you think you need to repent this morning yeah you need to ask God to forgive you amen you can't go to heaven like that now you got to get rid of your anger before you get to God's kingdom you got to get rid of it you can't go on God's kingdom with no anger anger angry ain't getting in God's Kingdom amen amen now we got to repent of it is not a part of a Christian nature to get angry amen it's not a part of a Christian nature to get angry to Christian nature to say father forgive them they don't know what they do hitting on a part of a Christian to get angry they better take wrong than to get angry see so there's a call for a repentance now amen praise God you get away from anger amen praise the Lord there will try to get you angry to get your soul lost Hallelujah you know anger Started With the Devil anyway he got mad because God was greater than him he wanted to be better than God and he got angry and rebelled against God yeah that would have started from all that stuff come from the Devil so he got angry because he wasn't being worshiped so he he got angry he didn't want to be in worship so he started fighting against God even got the angels to turn against God the Bible says he drew a third of the angels with them all because he got angry came down now he hates God knowing that he hate God he hates God's children come on somebody the devil don't love you he's angry with you mad with you because you're saved Hallelujah he don't like you but he won't save that same anger Us in him and he want to put it inside you don't you let the devil do you like that the Bible you're not ain't gonna hit his device if we didn't want no Angry Spirit say man Hallelujah amen praise God so Jesus came preaching repentance John the Baptist came also preaching repentance amen praise God to go to Matthew the third chapter join the Baptist of the Forerunner of Christ uh came preaching repentance to the people amen the religious people not the center people the religious people because a lot of times we don't know we need to repent we don't think we don't repented enough so we need to paint no more that's those the one need to repent Hallelujah be the ones that need the more repentant than the sinner does amen the beginning of the gospel of Christ the son of God's written in the prophet behold I will send my messenger before thy favor thy way before me the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you to where the law make his path straight John did baptized in the wilderness and preached a baptism of repentance for the remission of sin so John was preaching the baptism I Repent come get baptized for repentance Hallelujah the religious leader that day they didn't want to say nothing had nothing to do with John but those simple people heard John that's right there was one that the Pharisees Sadducees scribe whatever herodian they didn't like that was the one that came and heard John's message of repentance the religious leader that they didn't despise John they want to hear John's message you didn't come like he wanted they wanted him to come he wasn't dressed in robes and fancy clothes he wasn't sheep's sheepskin that's right another girl about his alone eating Locust and wild honey they had nothing to do with John but John came with the matter repent Hallelujah repentance say man praise God he got all those religious leaders that day he said don't think you have Abraham to your father the only thing because you're very religious you can run your genitality back to Abraham that you all right he said no sir he's a god evil these stones are raise up children under Abraham so you need to repent that was your message repent from what you're doing repent be religious amen but don't don't know the way of God not in the way that God wants you to be amen praise God so repentance must be genuine I don't know whether you I don't know your heart but God does your repentance must be what genuine amen amen you must mean it from your heart that Lord I Repent of this thing that I have done a law that I was doing I Repent of the Lord and I'm sorry I did it I don't want to do it no more hallelujah how many you don't want to do it no more I don't want to do it no more Hallelujah I don't want to come on my life no more Lord I'm sorry and sometimes you really repent and then you all know what I'm talking about you don't have been in that place one time before you done been there you did something wrong you cried before the law and after the law to forgive you amen because you're doing you're doing good wrong so you've done been there before you know what I'm talking about you've asked the law you repent and you were sincere you was genuine and didn't bring a change in your life something changed didn't it why because you was genuine the Lord knew you was real see never God looking for the small not something so I Repent no he want to see genuine repentance with some fruits Amen in it amen good works Fallen Emmanuel repentance amen look at an example let's go to the book of Psalm 51. we talk about this all the time amen but we're going to read a little bit this morning by the grace of God Psalm 51 Hallelujah you all know the story of David but here David also this morning is a good example of what repentance amen here go a good example of a real repentance he did wrong everybody know David did wrong y'all know the story of David how you took killed that man took that man's wife and all that bad stuff that he did he thought he got away but then God said who Nathan the prophet to remind him of his sin you know God is only about the mercy of God that God don't send somebody in your mind you your sin see God can call us out anytime you want to there's only the mercy of God remember that now if you don't press anything upon you this morning I want you to know about the grace of God remember this that God can call our sins out if he still choose to do so now the Bible said uh the chastening of the Lord is good for you you need to be chanced by the law so when God don't call it our sins is for our own benefit David thought he had got away how many y'all with me this morning did not David thought he had got away he thought he got away but it was the mercy of God that came and exposed his sin so you won't never want to sin and think you get away with it because you're not going to get away you need God to expose you now before it's too late you don't want it to go on like it nothing happened he said oh I got away nobody no but God does know now and God can't expose your sin and only the mercy of God that he does so thank God if my sins get exposed amen or it might look shameful it might look bad but it's Gonna Save My Soul see it's going to save your soul when God exposes you usually want to know you know who don't want to be exposed the Devil he's the only one that don't want to be exposed did y'all hear that the devil does not want to be exposed because when you're exposed the devil we can cast him out we can defeat him that's right so when you're covering hide your sins amen that means you're acting just like the devil see so thank God when he come and expose our sins so David's sin got exposed thou like the man come on somebody they're all like the man you the man that should die but here David in the book of Psalm begin to cry out to God a real repentance have mercy on me o God according to a loving kindness according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies and blot out my transgressions brought up my wrong doing that I did Wash Me thoroughly for my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin oh he's crying out now he's confessing that thing in it confessing that wrong doing why he wants some repentance amen you want God to forgive him amen if I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me see you got the knowledge of Ron doing you can't keep on doing wrong expect you're gonna get away with it see David did thought he got away he thought nobody else knew to accept the people that was privy with him and had them that help him deal with his sin he had different people helping him in his sin and he thought he's going to get away but thank God for Nathan God sent and Nathan the prophet Amen to get him straight see and now he comes to repentance amen he's repenting before God amen trying to get it right now before it's too late and God did forgive David his sin because I put away thy transcribe put away thy sin and may God forgave David David came to repentance and God forgave him see that's what God wants to do this morning amen God just want you to come to repentance for you to forgive you amen amen you can move on with the Lord so you don't don't stand don't confess it don't confess it and and let God forgive you amen be sincere about it cry if he got you I'm y'all we ain't crying in a long time you know I love that Mercy one time we used to cry you don't see too many crying no more people don't cry like to use with all sins but Iran's doing we don't see much of that no more hey man people just come to church you know thank God for that don't get me wrong thank God for that but it's a call to repentance we need to get right with God we need to do better than what we're doing praise God we need to amen so that repentance is important because it's a part of our Christian journey I mean the part of a man being a Christian amen is coming to repentance amen praise God look at another scripture I got them written all over the place there by the grace of God Amen let's go to the book of mouth first Peter amen praise God so David repented thank God he repented you know some people in the Bible read about didn't repent we're gonna read those to you so some people they're not going to repent they they won't repent though they hear the truth and Noah's right they still won't repent and we're gonna read that to you by the grace of God so you don't want to be in that state that you heard the truth but you don't want to repent don't be in that state because the people in that state they were like they wind up in a worse state see when God has exposed you that when the time you need to come to repentance right there see a lot of people they don't want knowledge that they need to repent so that they end up in worse shape than what they were before the uh that the word came see so you don't be in that stage you want to acknowledge your sin before the Lord realize amen that you need to repent amen amen what I said I said uh Peter first Peter 3. they might say first Peter remember uh II Peter excuse me I might get my scriptures wrong amen second Peter 3 and 9. so the Lord is not slack concerning his promises some men count slackness but his long-suffering to us Ward not willing to any what Perry but all should come to what repent at all now God long suffering some people get that confused go along suffering and really he ain't did nothing he'd punished you you know uh chastising you that's called long suffering he's giving you a chance to repent amen so I would say the Bible said not wondering any Superior the long-suffering of God he deals along with us God be Islam Without Even in our wrongdoing God Bears long with us why you think you're being so long with us give us a chance to repent yeah because there ain't nothing gonna happen to me everything's gonna be going smooth you're like always go smooth everything's gonna be all right ain't not gonna happen God's long suffering just waiting for you to do what come to repentance but one day the long suffering is going to run out see his long suffering he don't want anybody to perish God don't want nobody to be lost the devil wants you to be lost but not God God wants you to be saved amen but God so loved the world to give with only begotten the sons will believe in him should not pray but have what everlasting life God but the devil wants you to go to hell God wants you to go to heaven God wants you to be saved in order to be saved you must come to repentance God in this long suffering will wait long for us to get right here we're long on us to get right because he's not wanting us to perish but he's going to make us get right you got to want to get right you got to want to come to repentance Hallelujah when you hear the word of God that's God calling you you ought to want to come to repentance for God long-suffering will run out see his long-suffering amen amen is there to give us all a chance to repent that's what it's there for is not to get us make a thing you know gonna happen to us everything will keep on going smooth but as long suffering is there to give us that space to come to repentance that was there for thank God for a long suffering because he would have dealt with us like he should have dealt with us Lord where will we be here come on somebody yeah God I dealt with you according to the sins you've been doing what will you be at right now with a long suffering to give you a chance to repent give me a chance to make it right before it's too late amen praise God look at here let's go to the book of um um um Judas let's go to Matthew 27. now Judas waited too late to repent did y'all hear that Judas waited too late to repent now you don't want to be in that shape see don't wait too late he waited too late to get it right he did the wrong thing anyway but he waited too late to come to repentance [Music] it was a little too late too A Little Too Short too late it was a little too short lady wait a little too short too late see now what happened to Judas he had no he can't find no repentance he can't get no repentance Matthew 27. you can't get none y'all know what Judas did he betrayed Christ that's right he betrayed Christ run in the influence of the devil [Music] 30 pieces of silver but when he came to himself uh what he did he he wanted to repent from it but couldn't notice Matthew 27 when morning was come all the chief priests and elderly people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death and when they abounded him they LED them away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor then Judas which betrayed him when he saw the egg contempted in uh what though he condemned the innocent he was condemned repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of of silver to the chief priests and Elders saying I have sinned and I betrayed the innocent blood I say it's a little too late now winner see it's too late and they say what if they didn't care about them they don't drop what they want out of them won't the devil then use you I'll be used up the devil then use Judas do those Chief priests and those religious leaders that day they used Judas to betray Christ now look at the attitude toward him he didn't gave him 30 pieces of silver he came back one to repent but they said what is that to us she's out of that [Music] see that what the devil does he'll use you up you think he care if you if you repent you don't care as long as you don't use you up I hope y'all heard that this morning the devil will use you up get you through all kind of evil things and then you come to your senses and say oh Lord but the devil don't care nothing about that you don't care same with this religious leader didn't care about Judah so he couldn't repent couldn't find the repentance it was too late he sold the law for 30 pieces of silver sold him out amen he cast it down you know what Judah went and did he wouldn't hung himself see all because he waited too late to come to repentance he waited too late to make it right really too late to do the right thing he waited too late I mean how many people waiting too late this morning waiting too late to get it right waiting too late to do the right thing when are you going to do it come on somebody when you gonna do it don't wait too late Judas waited too late he couldn't get no repentance couldn't find none amen praise God so he wanted to repent but couldn't did y'all hear that he wanted to repent but couldn't you don't want to be in that ship this morning you want to come to repent of what God is calling you want to come when he's calling to repent and look at another one by the grace of God they go to the book of Hebrews how many I remember the story Esau Hallelujah praise God Hebrews 12. foreign 16. so unless there be any foreign pregnant Esau who for one muscle of meat sold her Birthright and no Esau did he's uh when you read the story of that what he did it don't look so bad how many I ever read that story it's all good for me to read this the birthright is the most important thing during that age and it still is doing neighbor we don't do Birthright like that like they did it back then the the birthright is that the firstborn gets everything are the Lion's Share of everything and that was a great thing because that why that's why Jacob wanted it so bad wanted that Birthright real bad see and that why he uh he did what he did to Esau but Esau shouldn't have did that he should never sell his Birthright you know what your breast write this this morning what's your birth right this morning it's the Holy Ghost don't sell it out for the devil for a little bit of pleasure of the world don't sell your breath right out to the devil for the page of this world don't sell out here get you to sell it out now he'll get you to sell out God for what a little bit of muscle I mean a little bit of fun a little bit of deliver that don't you sell it out this morning I mean he saw after he sold his breath right you know what he wanted it was too late he done so now and Jacob wasn't going to give it back because Jacob wanted that breath right that's right come here he wanted that Breath Right he wanted a band that way he did what he did to his brother because he wanted that Breath Right see he wanted it back and only did Jacob get his breath right but Jacob also got his Blessing who gave it to him God did how did God give it to him through his mother come on somebody God uses mother to give him that give to give him amen the the uh the inherent the blessing put him in Esau by birth Allah by birth but God all of us got to take none of the Bible said then God said Esau uh Jacob have a love but he's all happy about what do you think God hated Esau because he thought was evil Esau never repented he did things on purpose to aggravate his mama and his daddy how many you ever read that in the Bible the Bible said because he know a displeasant mom and dad as you marry those worldly girls he wanted to marry them anyway yeah what Esau did see he did things intentionally to upset his parents he was wicked hoping you got no children like that this morning don't you you doing things intentionally to upset your parents you know your parents don't like you doing certain things you said you're gonna do it anyway but that's the way children are on this last day they do do what they want to do ain't children delinquency apparent delinquency we don't we don't do the rod enough we don't do the router now we we coming up we know about that about getting beatens your children this generation here you don't get beaten like we did they might get a yell at their parents didn't save a cuss at but no beating see we raise up in a generation Our Generation we got whipping for what we did but now in this generation children do anything say anything do we beat them like we supposed to no well watch out now you better go like God words say you spit around you spoiled a child you might might grow up to be a monster you don't want a monster on your hand you say why you say a monster by the given because children get out of control money got out of control was hard to contain them so you better contain them while you got a chance why you got them you had to contain them because once he got out of control they're out of control I'm gonna go and sit therefore they end up in jail they end up on drugs they end up in the street because when you had the opportunity to contain them and bring them into subjection you didn't do what the word of God said you let them go and do what they want to do say what they want to say and they're out of control now now you can't do nothing with them what you gonna do now you better stop praying better repent tell Lord I messed up come on somebody Lord I messed up Lord forgive me I didn't whip that child and do that child like I was opposed to Lord I'm sorry you think people gonna do that today no they think everything all right that's my child do what they want to do my child cutting them back to school that's my child they bet don't say nothing to my child child being bad kick out of school getting suspended that's my child all right you better get them under control though if it was too late why do we say all that because of Esau Esau did everything he could to Vex his parents that's why God said Jacob have I loved and he thought how about what I hate it God hated Esau because of what his ways what he was doing parent children obey your parents in the law for this is what this is right see obey your parent not only in the law but they ain't saying well babe too that's what you're supposed to do amen so Esau amen soul is birthright Disobedience to his parents and you know what he wanted he wanted repentance he wanted uh to come and get the blessing back he wanted but listen to the 17th verse for you know the how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he started carefully with tears too late he cried and y'all read the Bible he cried before my father my father after I only cried but no repent he couldn't change that blessing that's already gave me Jacob Jacob said I blessed him and he will be blessed I have blessed them and he shall be blessed see can't take it back Esau couldn't find no repentance why he shouldn't have sold his breath right from the beginning he should not have sold it that was precious it still is don't say your Birthright don't sell out the Holy Ghost don't sell out God for a little bit of pleasure of the world you won't find repentance you're gonna find no place to repentance that's also in the book of Hebrews amen how there's no place of repentance amen let's read that real quick by the grace of God Hebrews the sixth chapter see there's no place or repentance once you sell Jesus the Lord out then there's no place there's no place for repentance from there amen praise God uh six six and three and this we do of God permit for it's impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and we may partake of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world have come if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentance seeing they're crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh and have put them to an open shame don't sell your Birthright there's no place for repentance see there'll be no place for repentance you sell Christ out now there's no place for repentance you can't sell
