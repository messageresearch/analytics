[31:21] by god's grace
[31:24] matthew 6 god is good amen
[31:38] just want to minister tonight on a
[31:39] little something that started on
[31:42] this past weekend
[31:45] matthew 6 and 19.
[31:53] you got to say amen and it reads
[31:57] lay not up for yourselves treasures
[32:02] upon the earth where moth and dust
[32:05] do corrupt and where thieves break
[32:08] through the steel
[32:09] but lay up for yourselves treasure in
[32:12] heaven
[32:13] where neither moth nor rust nor dove
[32:16] door
[32:17] nor moth nor rust does corrupt
[32:20] and where thieves do not break through
[32:22] nor steel you may be seated
[32:24] we want to continue on it says for where
[32:28] your treasure is
[32:30] there there will your heart be also
[32:33] the light of the body is the eye if
[32:36] therefore thine
[32:37] i be single thy whole body is full of
[32:40] light
[32:41] but if thine eye be evil thy whole body
[32:44] is full of darkness
[32:46] if therefore the dark if therefore the
[32:48] light
[32:49] that is in thee be darkness how great is
[32:53] that darkness
[32:54] no man can serve two masters for he will
[32:58] either hate one
[32:59] and love the other or else he will hold
[33:03] to one and despise the other
[33:05] you cannot serve god amen therefore i
[33:08] say unto you
[33:09] take no thought for your life what you
[33:12] shall eat
[33:13] what you shall drink know yet for your
[33:15] body what you shall put on
[33:18] is not the life more than meat and the
[33:21] body more than raiment
[33:22] behold the fowls of the air for they so
[33:25] not
[33:26] neither do they reap nor gather into
[33:28] barns yet your heavenly father feedeth
[33:30] them
[33:30] are ye not much better than they which
[33:33] of you by taking thought can add one
[33:36] cubit to his statue and why take ye
[33:39] thought for raymond
[33:41] consider the lilies of the field how
[33:42] they grow they told not
[33:45] neither do they spin and yet i say unto
[33:48] you
[33:48] and even solomon and all his glory was
[33:52] not arrayed like one of these wherefore
[33:54] if god so clothes the grass of the field
[33:57] which is which today is and tomorrow is
[34:00] cast unto heaven
[34:01] and i mean into the oven shall he not
[34:04] much more clothe you o ye of little
[34:08] faith
[34:09] therefore take no thought saying what
[34:12] shall we eat
[34:13] or what shall we drink or whether all
[34:15] with
[34:16] whether with all shall we be clothed
[34:19] for after these things do the gentiles
[34:22] seek
[34:22] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[34:26] have need of all these things but seek
[34:29] ye first the kingdom of god
[34:31] and his righteousness and all these
[34:33] things
[34:34] shall be added unto you therefore take
[34:37] no thought
[34:38] for the moral the moral shall take
[34:41] thought for itself
[34:43] for the things of itself sufficient
[34:46] until the day
[34:47] is the evil thereof may god bless you
[34:50] reading of his word again tonight by
[34:53] god's grace
[34:54] i want to minister to you for a moment
[34:56] and i entitled it just something i just
[34:58] just started dealing with on this past
[35:01] weekend
[35:02] i entitled it to masters amen
[35:05] two masters you know taking it here from
[35:08] the 24th verse and how jesus was
[35:11] was crying out to the people and
[35:15] even to us today he says that no man can
[35:18] serve two masters
[35:20] for either he will hate the one and love
[35:23] the other
[35:24] come on i said you know just meditating
[35:27] on the word i
[35:28] i said that's a strong word he said you
[35:31] can't serve two masters
[35:33] he said you're gonna hate one and you're
[35:34] gonna love the other
[35:36] you say i love god but i love the world
[35:38] come on he said you're gonna hate
[35:39] one and you're gonna love the other so
[35:42] we're talking tonight about
[35:43] two masters you know i was thinking i
[35:46] said the problem
[35:47] that we're faced with today you know is
[35:50] no different
[35:51] than the problems that the other
[35:52] generations were faced with
[35:55] and one of that one of those problems is
[35:57] that you know
[35:58] the people uh they want to be in the
[36:01] church
[36:02] they desire to be in the church and in
[36:04] the world at the same time
[36:06] you know i think about how paul talked
[36:09] about it as
[36:10] some somewhat uh a battle a war
[36:13] he says with with my mind you know with
[36:16] my spirit i want to serve god
[36:18] he said but with my flesh you know it's
[36:20] wanting to serve sin come on
[36:21] but you can't serve two masters you're
[36:24] gonna love one or you're gonna hate the
[36:25] other
[36:26] so we find that like we said the battle
[36:29] that we see in
[36:30] uh uh or the things we see in aroused
[36:33] today
[36:34] is no different than what all the other
[36:36] generations had to face with
[36:38] you know the people want to i said being
[36:40] on the world and
[36:41] in the church at church and in the world
[36:43] at the same time
[36:45] i said like this they want to have
[36:47] enough religion
[36:48] as we say to satisfy god so they think
[36:53] because you know it's no such thing as
[36:55] that but sometimes
[36:57] we want to have enough religion just to
[36:59] satisfy god
[37:01] and then yet we still want to at times
[37:04] step out the gates
[37:06] in and enjoy the pleasures as they say
[37:10] of sin
[37:11] come on but jesus like i said was crying
[37:15] out to him
[37:15] he said you can't serve two masters
[37:18] you're gonna love morning you're gonna
[37:19] hate the other come on
[37:21] so we find that even when
[37:24] he he began to cry out to this age of
[37:27] the laodicean church
[37:29] he began to say that he says i find that
[37:32] you lukewarm you ain't cold no you're
[37:34] hot
[37:35] he said but you lukewarm he said i would
[37:38] that you would rather be cold or hot
[37:40] come on cause you can't serve two
[37:41] masters
[37:42] yeah i rather you either be in or out he
[37:44] says but but since you
[37:46] you're in between he says that you know
[37:48] i'ma spew you out of my mouth
[37:50] so we find that a lot of times our
[37:53] actions make god sick
[37:55] we can say it like that our actions it
[37:58] does something to god to way
[38:00] he says i want to spew you out of my
[38:02] mouth come on
[38:03] but i said lord uh it's time
[38:06] that we revisit our our uh i believe
[38:10] uh salvation or revisit our commitment
[38:13] to god
[38:14] i think about david and how david he
[38:17] began to say
[38:18] all the days of my life will i serve you
[38:21] lord
[38:21] come on so i said lord sometimes
[38:24] and many of times in our christian
[38:26] journey we got to revisit our commitment
[38:28] that we made
[38:29] that commitment that we made when we
[38:31] were desperate when we were in need
[38:34] when god was our only answer when he was
[38:37] our only hope
[38:38] when he was our only savior and we
[38:40] needed help
[38:42] we said lord if you come help me out of
[38:44] this situation i'll never go
[38:46] back lord i serve you all the days of my
[38:49] life that's the commitment that we made
[38:50] come on
[38:51] and god came didn't he because the thing
[38:54] about it is god is faithful
[38:57] he's more faithful than you and i uh
[38:59] brother and sister
[39:00] god is faithful god is there we always
[39:03] say
[39:04] lord i praise you through the good and
[39:06] the bad come on
[39:07] but when those things come upon our
[39:09] lives sometimes we lose our faith
[39:12] sometimes we go back on our stance on
[39:14] god
[39:15] why because we were just singing a song
[39:18] or or just making a statement but god is
[39:20] faithful
[39:21] when god told us that he'd be there with
[39:24] us
[39:24] through the good of the bad god meant in
[39:26] every word that he said
[39:28] god won't walk away from us in our
[39:30] lowest points
[39:31] i think about the the footprints on the
[39:33] sand the time
[39:34] he said lord in my in my darkest time
[39:37] and my heart is
[39:38] trials and life i only saw one set of
[39:40] footprints
[39:41] he said my child that's the time i was
[39:43] carrying you
[39:45] you thought god left you but god didn't
[39:47] leave you god was there
[39:48] with you through the good and the bad
[39:50] come on whether you was happy or sad god
[39:52] was still there
[39:54] encouraging you telling you to get up
[39:56] and fight come on
[39:57] letting you know that i'll never leave
[39:59] you nor forsake you
[40:01] the whole world might be against you but
[40:03] i'm still in your corner
[40:05] you still got to fight in you come on
[40:07] you still got to press in you
[40:09] god gave you something to give you
[40:10] enough to encourage you to
[40:12] carry on didn't he made me think about
[40:15] gideon and
[40:16] how he said if the lord be with us come
[40:18] on if god be with us
[40:19] where all his miracles come on but the
[40:22] thing about it is
[40:23] god never left them come on god said i'm
[40:26] still here and i got my miracles with me
[40:28] come on
[40:28] and my power is still the same and
[40:31] that's what it is sometimes we get in
[40:33] that place
[40:34] god if you be with us then where are you
[40:36] come on but i'm to the place now
[40:38] where i said lord i'm gonna believe you
[40:40] god no matter what
[40:41] i'm gonna have faith in you and i won't
[40:44] waver
[40:45] you know i i like how hearing the
[40:47] scriptures how jesus
[40:49] uh uh and in in the scriptures here our
[40:52] reading
[40:53] he kept saying take no thought come on
[40:56] don't
[40:56] don't even worry about that why because
[40:58] he's already got it all
[41:00] in control he said don't take no thought
[41:02] he said it maybe four or five times
[41:04] therefore take no thought what is he
[41:06] saying i want you just to trust me
[41:08] and god gets us to those places to where
[41:11] we can only have one
[41:12] one answer or one one uh uh
[41:16] like they say jesus is the answer for
[41:18] the world today we only got one
[41:20] way of escape and that way of escape is
[41:22] him
[41:23] and i'm so glad that he is the way of
[41:25] escape because he never failed
[41:28] and he never will fail brothers and
[41:30] sisters he never will
[41:31] so i thank god tonight but i want to
[41:35] like i said talk to you about like he
[41:38] was saying here about two masters come
[41:40] on
[41:40] he says you can't learn you can't you
[41:42] can't have two
[41:44] you can't have but one and he said
[41:46] you're gonna love one and you're gonna
[41:48] hate the other but we find that
[41:50] you know that what he says that's what's
[41:52] going uh uh with
[41:53] what's happening today people wanna uh
[41:56] give
[41:57] have enough just just a little to say
[41:59] they got religion
[42:00] but like we said they want to step
[42:02] outside of the gates come on
[42:04] i like how in one example how jesus
[42:08] when he was dealing with the with the
[42:09] young rich ruler
[42:11] and you know he began to just
[42:13] paraphrasing and talking to the young
[42:15] rich ruler and
[42:16] the young rich ruler said good master he
[42:18] said what must i do
[42:20] you know to be saved and jesus began to
[42:22] talk to him about
[42:23] uh the ten commandments and you know i
[42:25] was beginning to say i says he talked to
[42:27] him about having good religion come on
[42:30] and and the rich ruler young rich rule
[42:32] says that
[42:33] i kept all these things from my youth
[42:36] but yet it was
[42:37] something down on the deep on the inside
[42:40] of him
[42:41] that he knew something was missing and
[42:44] how many
[42:44] times uh uh individuals we ourselves
[42:49] we know that it's something missing come
[42:51] on
[42:52] it's something missing out of my life
[42:55] it's something
[42:56] that i need more of come on i i know
[42:59] that i go to church i got good
[43:00] religion but i'm missing something i'm
[43:03] missing the power
[43:04] i'm missing the anointing i'm missing
[43:07] i'm trying to live right but i'm missing
[43:09] the
[43:10] one that can help me live right come on
[43:12] he knew that it was something that he
[43:14] was missing
[43:15] and jesus began to talk to him he says
[43:18] okay
[43:19] i want you to go and sell uh what you
[43:21] got
[43:22] and i want you to give it to the poor
[43:24] come on he said all these things
[43:26] and then it to the young witch ruler
[43:28] that was hard he couldn't do those
[43:30] things
[43:30] but then the bible said that i like how
[43:33] it says that jesus
[43:34] loved him come on and i want to say
[43:36] tonight jesus loves you and i
[43:39] he desires that all be saved that's why
[43:41] he came and died
[43:42] for the sins of the whole world he loves
[43:44] you but he knows that you can't have two
[43:47] masters
[43:48] he knows that the only way you're going
[43:50] to get the benefits from god is you got
[43:52] to forsake the whole world come on
[43:54] not some of the world but the whole
[43:56] world you got to give up
[43:58] everything you got to let go and let god
[44:01] have its way in your life
[44:02] you got to let god be god in your life
[44:05] you got to say god whatever it is you
[44:07] want me to give up god i'm gonna give it
[44:08] all
[44:09] up lord because god knows like he says
[44:12] he says uh jesus loved him come on he
[44:15] knew that
[44:15] he said you can't he says here you can't
[44:17] serve two masters he knew that
[44:19] you know money or riches was a problem
[44:22] for this young man
[44:24] so he wanted to help that young man eat
[44:26] to move that stumbling block out of your
[44:28] way but the young man couldn't let those
[44:30] things go
[44:31] said that he walked away you know uh
[44:33] sorrowful
[44:34] come on but i think about that even in
[44:37] our lives
[44:38] jesus knows what's holding you back from
[44:41] getting what you need from him
[44:43] god knows what's keeping you from the
[44:46] from the new birth come on
[44:47] he knows you know you might had a touch
[44:50] of the holy ghost just a a little bit on
[44:52] your flesh
[44:53] in your spirit but i say tonight god
[44:55] wants to fill you up come on
[44:57] god you we sing the song lord fill me up
[45:00] god wants to fill you up
[45:02] he wants your cup to run over but
[45:04] sometimes it's stuff in our way
[45:06] and he said i can't have two masters
[45:08] come on i need you to let go
[45:10] and let me be the master in your life i
[45:12] want to say tonight god is a good master
[45:15] god is one that's gonna be able to take
[45:17] care of you he said look at those
[45:19] birds of the air he says they don't put
[45:21] in the barns and all these things and he
[45:23] says
[45:23] your heavenly father take care of them
[45:26] that god gone
[45:27] he provides for them and he says if he
[45:29] does those things for them what about
[45:31] you and i
[45:32] it did something to my soul to know that
[45:35] god has got it all in control as we say
[45:38] god
[45:38] he's going to provide all your needs he
[45:40] said just let me be the master in your
[45:42] life
[45:43] trust me with the things that you don't
[45:45] think that i'm able to handle
[45:47] and god will show you with the things
[45:49] you've been facing with put them in
[45:50] god's hands
[45:51] the things you've been battling with let
[45:53] god fight all your battles come on
[45:55] give it to god and watch god take care
[45:58] of it it'll be just like it wasn't
[45:59] nothing but a moment
[46:00] all your suffering trial and tribulation
[46:03] it ain't be to be compared with the
[46:05] glory that god wanted to reveal in you
[46:07] and i
[46:08] and the things that he got stored up for
[46:10] us but
[46:11] we got to let go come on i says
[46:15] i i says in the last
[46:18] sermon i was saying that you know paul
[46:21] was talking about he was saying don't
[46:23] come short of it come on
[46:24] he was saying our fear he was saying let
[46:27] us
[46:27] let us come on press on let us go on
[46:30] into he says because i fear lest any of
[46:32] us
[46:33] come short of it talking about you know
[46:35] going into the land as we said
[46:37] israel is going to a natural land but
[46:39] they were going we're looking at us
[46:40] going into a spiritual
[46:42] land come on he says i don't want you to
[46:44] fall short of it like they did come on
[46:46] so we finding that even today let's
[46:48] don't fall short of it
[46:50] and we we come to that place in time you
[46:53] know
[46:53] as we were talking about are we staying
[46:56] tonight serving two masters
[46:57] i think about it you know in this life
[47:00] you know
[47:01] it says you know in this life it's only
[47:04] three things
[47:05] the the the pleasures uh uh i mean the
[47:09] let's look at it first john two so i
[47:11] don't wanna mess it all up
[47:13] first john two amen
[47:16] god is good amen two masters
[47:22] he said you can't serve too he said
[47:25] you'll even you'll either love one
[47:31] and hate the other first john 2 and
[47:36] 15.
[47:38] let's begin at the sixth sixteenth verse
[47:40] he says for all that is in the world
[47:42] like we said
[47:43] it what what is what is this life life
[47:46] about it says for all
[47:48] that is in the world is the lust of the
[47:50] flesh the lust of the
[47:51] eyes and the pride of the life and the
[47:54] pride of life
[47:55] is not is not of the father but is of
[47:58] the world
[47:59] they said that's all the things that is
[48:01] in this world is the lust of the flesh
[48:03] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[48:05] life and that's it come on
[48:07] and he says that you know these things
[48:10] but he says here in the 15th verse
[48:12] he was saying love not the world neither
[48:15] the things that are
[48:16] in the world he says if any man loved
[48:19] the world the love of the father is not
[48:21] in them come on
[48:22] he wants uh like he says he wants a
[48:24] total separation
[48:25] not only did he said don't love the
[48:27] world he said but don't love the things
[48:30] that are in the world
[48:31] he said because if you love those things
[48:33] he said the love of the father
[48:34] is not in you but we're talking about i
[48:37] always say it's two masters we find that
[48:39] many times today i says that
[48:44] you know you know we look at
[48:47] people as individuals want to be in
[48:50] in in the world and out of the world at
[48:52] the same time
[48:53] in the church and not in in the world at
[48:56] the same time and i said it's not
[48:58] it's not so much that a individual
[49:02] love god that that
[49:05] they want to i guess serve them or
[49:07] please them but a lot of times
[49:09] you know they know that they're in need
[49:12] of his power
[49:14] they know that that they're in need of
[49:16] him
[49:17] so they can't let him go completely
[49:20] but because then they know that it's
[49:23] gonna come sometimes where they're gonna
[49:24] have to cry out jesus
[49:26] and they're gonna need them to be there
[49:27] so you know it's a lot of times
[49:29] we we we feel that way what it is
[49:33] is trickery of the devil to make us
[49:36] believe
[49:37] that all the time you can be in and out
[49:41] and you can call on god and he'll always
[49:44] show up
[49:45] but maybe it'll be a time when you call
[49:48] on the lord and he won't be able to be
[49:50] found
[49:51] i think about samson and how he played
[49:55] just long enough he was in and out in
[49:58] and out come on but you can't serve two
[50:00] masters
[50:01] but when he came to the time where he
[50:04] he needed help he said i'll go shake
[50:06] myself he could look to the covenant
[50:08] that god made him as other times but it
[50:11] was a time
[50:12] when he went to shake himself and he
[50:14] didn't realize that the bible says
[50:16] he didn't know that god wasn't with him
[50:18] come on he didn't know that
[50:20] but so we find that even in our lives
[50:23] today
[50:24] don't let don't let the devil deceive
[50:26] you come on
[50:27] don't be not deceived like this the
[50:29] bible says god is not mocked
[50:31] whatever a man so that's what he gonna
[50:33] reap come on so we wanna what do we
[50:35] wanna do
[50:36] we wanna sow the good things of god we
[50:39] to show the right
[50:40] fruits fruits that'll bring forth
[50:42] repentance
[50:43] fruits that'll bring forth a man or a
[50:46] sister or daughter
[50:47] a humbleness one that'll walk before god
[50:50] saying lord i am all that i am only
[50:53] because of what you made me
[50:54] one that got pleasing god on their mind
[50:57] from the time they get up to the time
[50:59] they lay down in the evening
[51:01] i was laying in the bed the other day
[51:02] and i was i was just meditating on
[51:04] myself i said lord
[51:06] it ain't just about preaching it ain't
[51:08] just about being popular
[51:09] all these things i said god but i need a
[51:11] word from you
[51:13] lord i need something that's gonna when
[51:15] it's gonna reach down
[51:16] into the hearts of the people that's
[51:18] gonna uproot sin
[51:20] that's gonna uproot unbelief and all
[51:22] these things and get somebody some help
[51:24] lord
[51:24] that's what i need i said god if you
[51:26] need somebody to cry loud and spare not
[51:29] let me be the one god don't let me be
[51:31] ashamed of the testimony of jesus christ
[51:34] hallelujah why because i know it's good
[51:37] for your soul
[51:38] i know it'll help you in a time when you
[51:40] need help i know that god
[51:42] he ain't doing nothing but what he what
[51:44] something to help you
[51:46] i know that why god does that he beats
[51:49] us up a lot of time not
[51:50] beats us up but he chastises us why
[51:52] because he's a good father
[51:54] come on we're saying that song he's a
[51:56] good good father a good good father
[51:58] chastises his children
[52:00] he lets them know where they're wrong
[52:01] then he uplifts them where they're right
[52:03] but he does it all for the good how many
[52:06] believe that tonight
[52:07] and i thank god for that but that's what
[52:09] it is i said lord
[52:12] you know i says the more the closer we
[52:15] get
[52:15] uh uh even now to the end we got to be
[52:18] just that more like god come on
[52:20] he says when when we'll see him we'll be
[52:23] like him come on
[52:24] i believe we're going to be like them
[52:25] before we get off of this earth
[52:27] but not just you say we're caught up but
[52:30] you got to
[52:30] it's now you and christ becoming one
[52:34] that your mind you uh that are adopting
[52:37] a gain in
[52:38] the mind of christ and the mind of
[52:40] christ would be
[52:41] that like we said when you wake up in
[52:43] the morning lord
[52:45] i want to be pleasing to you help me
[52:47] lord
[52:48] that when i walk the day lord let my
[52:50] walking be pleasing to you
[52:52] whatever i say whatever i do god let it
[52:54] be pleasing to you
[52:56] whatever you want me to do god whatever
[52:57] you want me to say
[52:59] god wherever you want me to be god help
[53:01] me lord that i might be in your will
[53:03] come on
[53:04] i was sharing with somebody at work i
[53:06] said the thing about it is
[53:08] uh you we got to be conscious conscious
[53:11] that we want to be right with god at all
[53:14] times
[53:15] is that because at any time any moment
[53:18] things could turn
[53:20] and i was thinking about the little
[53:21] episode i had the other day and how
[53:23] i felt all right and then all of a
[53:25] sudden things just happened
[53:27] and i just didn't know what took place
[53:30] and i said you know just meditating on
[53:32] those things
[53:33] i said that's how how quickly your life
[53:35] could be gone
[53:36] that's how quickly your breath of life
[53:38] can be taken out of your body or things
[53:40] can turn for the worse
[53:42] and you don't have time to even get on
[53:44] on your knees you don't even have time
[53:46] to lift up your hands and say
[53:47] cry father forgive me you don't even
[53:49] have time but the best thing to do
[53:51] is while you got the breath of life
[53:54] right now
[53:55] while the blood is running warm in your
[53:57] veins right now
[53:58] wow you can lift your hands right now
[54:01] lift your hands and say thank you jesus
[54:03] give god all you got right now why
[54:06] because in the next moment it could be
[54:08] your time
[54:09] the answer to god for the things that
[54:11] you committed in your life
[54:13] hallelujah it becomes real god let
[54:16] things happen in your life
[54:18] unless you see that you need me more
[54:20] than you think come on
[54:22] you need me in the morning you need me
[54:23] in the evening you need me when you're
[54:25] walking on your job you need me all the
[54:27] day long
[54:28] hallelujah and god wants to be with you
[54:31] all the day long
[54:32] hallelujah but we find that i was
[54:35] sharing with someone that today
[54:37] i said the thing is uh it says you can't
[54:39] serve two masters
[54:41] i heard somebody make an absurd
[54:44] statement the other day and i said
[54:46] that's what it is
[54:48] that's what it did that's how the devil
[54:50] has deceived people
[54:51] that they come to that place to where
[54:54] like like the scripture says
[54:56] that they know that the people that
[54:59] commit these sins
[55:00] are worthy of death not only are they
[55:02] worthy of death that they know these
[55:04] things
[55:05] but they have pleasure in doing them
[55:07] come on
[55:08] the bible call them reprobate a time
[55:12] in a world even that we live in today
[55:15] would reach that
[55:16] such state of mind chaos with people
[55:19] like says
[55:20] completely lost their minds and they
[55:22] have pleasure at it come on
[55:23] they have pleasure in these things but
[55:25] you and i
[55:26] god has kept our minds and our mind
[55:29] still
[55:30] is to do what our pleasure still comes
[55:33] from what serving the lord
[55:35] our pleasure still comes from praising
[55:37] god and giving god
[55:39] everything that belongs to him and
[55:41] that's the our whole
[55:42] mind body and soul how many believe that
[55:45] tonight
[55:47] but we find that he says you can't you
[55:50] can't serve
[55:51] two masters you know like i said it's
[55:53] not so much that
[55:54] that the people wouldn't love god but
[55:58] it seems so much that they i mean
[56:00] wouldn't wouldn't um
[56:02] would love god it's just so much that
[56:04] they know they wouldn't be in need of
[56:05] his power
[56:07] you know i was thinking about how how uh
[56:10] israel was throughout the scriptures and
[56:13] how
[56:14] you know the bible when they begin to
[56:17] cry out to samuel
[56:19] give us a king we all know the story how
[56:22] he says god it says give us a king
[56:24] and and the thing is they even confess
[56:28] from their own mouth
[56:29] that samuel you didn't you didn't never
[56:31] do us no wrong
[56:33] yes god has always used you god has
[56:35] always been there for us
[56:37] we don't want you to completely go away
[56:40] but
[56:41] they says that we want to be like all
[56:43] the other nations come on
[56:45] but i want to say tonight you can't have
[56:47] two masters
[56:48] you're going to love one or you're going
[56:49] to hate the other they want god
[56:52] like they said because they know they
[56:53] need them for its power but we want to
[56:55] be like the world
[56:56] at the same time but we find out even
[57:00] what what what what happened to israel
[57:03] you know they found out when they got
[57:06] they man
[57:06] when they got the king just like as the
[57:09] as the world
[57:10] they got to be like the other world they
[57:12] found out that they couldn't serve the
[57:14] lord
[57:14] as they ought to why because you can't
[57:16] serve two masters
[57:18] you got to do the king's bidding come on
[57:20] but i thank god
[57:22] even here tonight that looking at it
[57:26] i says what it is we got so many cloud
[57:29] of witnesses we got so many warnings so
[57:31] many
[57:32] buffers of things that that come that we
[57:35] can
[57:35] see and hear and know even not only then
[57:38] but in our lifetime
[57:40] to know that you know you can't serve
[57:43] two sooner or later
[57:44] uh you're gonna you're gonna go to
[57:47] either one side or the other
[57:48] but we find that i want to say tonight
[57:52] why not serve the lord come on why not
[57:54] let god
[57:55] be your master isn't he good to you
[57:59] hasn't he been good to you why not serve
[58:02] him
[58:02] come on i remember uh pastor saying once
[58:06] he says
[58:07] he was saying is is god that bad to you
[58:10] and it's the devil that good to you come
[58:12] on but i want to say tonight
[58:14] god is good all the time how many
[58:16] believe that
[58:18] but we find that i says the thing is he
[58:20] he was he was looking here let's look
[58:22] back at matthew 6
[58:24] by god's grace it won't be long
[58:28] just like i said just something i just
[58:30] starting on and
[58:32] and it's just things that just grip my
[58:35] heart
[58:39] matthew six and like he says you can't
[58:42] serve
[58:43] you know god and ma'am in the world so
[58:47] we know that you know when he's talking
[58:49] about here
[58:50] jesus when he was talking about these
[58:53] two masters
[58:54] there's something uh that he kept
[58:56] attacking first
[58:58] and one of the things he was attacking
[59:01] was
[59:01] was treasures and riches the riches come
[59:04] on
[59:05] money and and we can say uh today he was
[59:08] he was attacking
[59:09] certain uh uh things he and then he kept
[59:12] on
[59:12] uh uh hitting on these things he was
[59:15] saying in
[59:16] in the 19th verse he was saying lay not
[59:18] up for yourself treasures on your
[59:20] on on this earth but he said in the 20
[59:22] verse but lay up yourself treasures in
[59:24] heaven
[59:25] he says where nor
[59:29] do nor moth where we're neither moth nor
[59:32] rust they'll corrupt and thieves do not
[59:34] break through the steel but in the 20th
[59:36] verse he says for where your treasure is
[59:39] there
[59:39] uh uh there will your heart be also
[59:42] when he was talking about you know uh
[59:45] these two masters
[59:46] a lot of what he was uh attacking was
[59:49] riches
[59:50] come on which riches and and worldly
[59:53] gain
[59:54] possession and all these things because
[59:56] he was attacking these things because he
[59:58] knew that
[59:59] there were so many that were led astray
[1:00:01] by these things
[1:00:03] you know money we think about how
[1:00:06] how how powerful spirit money has on it
[1:00:09] come on
[1:00:10] i think about even judas for him to sell
[1:00:13] his master
[1:00:15] for 20 pieces of silver come on a 30
[1:00:17] piece of silver
[1:00:18] for him to sell as a master come on the
[1:00:21] brothers
[1:00:22] sold their brother joseph for so many
[1:00:25] pieces of silver
[1:00:26] a lot of people did a lot of corrupt
[1:00:28] things for behind money
[1:00:30] that we can see and it led them the the
[1:00:32] the love of money
[1:00:34] come on it's the root of all evil the
[1:00:36] bible says it led
[1:00:38] led to a place uh led people to some
[1:00:41] dark places
[1:00:42] led people to do things that they
[1:00:45] thought they would have never done
[1:00:46] led people they end up in places that
[1:00:49] it would have been better off that they
[1:00:51] would have never even seen or even heard
[1:00:53] or thought of
[1:00:54] having certain riches of old things
[1:00:56] because they were better off
[1:00:58] but we find that and that's what jesus
[1:01:01] here began attacking now you might say
[1:01:04] uh
[1:01:04] uh money isn't my problem but i just
[1:01:07] want to say
[1:01:08] this is one of the things that even
[1:01:09] jesus was attacking it may not be money
[1:01:12] but whatever your problem is you can't
[1:01:14] serve two masters
[1:01:15] you can only you can't have but one at
[1:01:17] the time
[1:01:18] but jesus here laying these things out
[1:01:21] jesus
[1:01:22] talking about the treasures and and how
[1:01:25] you know a man
[1:01:27] in in the riches and all these things
[1:01:28] but he began to take the people
[1:01:31] and take you in our minds to get off of
[1:01:34] living of the things that we see and the
[1:01:37] material things
[1:01:39] and start leaning to the eyes of faith
[1:01:42] of looking to the unseen he began to
[1:01:46] tell them that's why
[1:01:47] we were saying he was saying take no
[1:01:48] thought come on take no thought he says
[1:01:51] i'm gonna provide for you
[1:01:52] he says i'm gonna bless you i'm gonna
[1:01:55] meet all your needs come on
[1:01:56] i'm not only gonna do that but he gonna
[1:01:58] heal you come on
[1:02:00] he gonna he's gonna be he be your healer
[1:02:03] he's gonna be
[1:02:04] the one there for you all the time
[1:02:07] so he wants to he wants wanting to get
[1:02:09] the people mined away from all these
[1:02:11] things now
[1:02:12] which says you can't we're not asking
[1:02:14] you to be fanatical
[1:02:15] and live in a fanatical way because we
[1:02:18] know that you got we got to do certain
[1:02:20] things just to maintain
[1:02:21] but when it becomes of the first thing
[1:02:24] to you
[1:02:25] that's when it becomes sin that's when
[1:02:27] it becomes a master to you
[1:02:29] he says seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:02:31] heaven
[1:02:32] come on seek you first the kingdom of
[1:02:34] god you got to seek god first
[1:02:36] in all of you all of your achievements
[1:02:40] and the things that you're trying to
[1:02:41] achieve in life all of your goals and
[1:02:44] ambitions
[1:02:45] you got to have god in the first of it
[1:02:47] you got to have
[1:02:48] god lord no matter what comes no matter
[1:02:51] what goes god i want you
[1:02:53] to be first in my life god i want you to
[1:02:55] be pleased first come on
[1:02:57] and then once you seek god first and
[1:02:59] your your desire
[1:03:01] and your will is to do the will of god
[1:03:04] then watch
[1:03:05] all these things to be added why because
[1:03:07] god and he'll bless you he know that
[1:03:10] you'll know how to handle the blessings
[1:03:12] that he want to give you
[1:03:13] many times god don't give us the
[1:03:15] blessings that we want
[1:03:16] right away because he know that it might
[1:03:18] destroy you it might kill you so
[1:03:21] sometimes god
[1:03:22] waits and he lets and he does things to
[1:03:24] build up character in us the way we get
[1:03:26] to the place
[1:03:27] that we realize that this earth ain't
[1:03:29] our home but we can profess
[1:03:31] like abraham that we're searching for a
[1:03:33] city who's building maker ain't god
[1:03:36] we ain't from here this ain't our
[1:03:38] permanent dwelling place but we're
[1:03:40] looking
[1:03:40] from the city that god has built we're
[1:03:42] looking for god to come back and take us
[1:03:44] again
[1:03:45] on high how many looking for that
[1:03:46] tonight so we look
[1:03:48] it says what it is he says don't don't
[1:03:51] lay up
[1:03:52] all these things and i like how
[1:03:55] how he was saying he was saying uh uh
[1:03:58] seek you first but he was uh here
[1:04:02] and he was well he but we find that
[1:04:05] he was talking about like we said you're
[1:04:06] talking about treasures come on
[1:04:09] you can't have two masters he was
[1:04:11] talking about
[1:04:12] uh uh you got you can you're gonna love
[1:04:14] one and you're gonna hate the other
[1:04:16] sooner or later things are gonna trip
[1:04:18] you up what am i trying to do tonight
[1:04:21] what is jesus trying to do get our eyes
[1:04:23] single
[1:04:24] to look to him and him alone get our
[1:04:26] eyes single
[1:04:28] to get our eyes away from the things of
[1:04:30] what we see and
[1:04:31] and like we say us through the eyes of
[1:04:32] faith look to him
[1:04:34] because he don't want when he comes i
[1:04:36] was sharing with someone the other day
[1:04:38] i says and we was reading in the
[1:04:39] scriptures how
[1:04:41] how the people they were saying let us
[1:04:43] return
[1:04:44] unto the lord and he'll heal us and
[1:04:47] god's response to the people was
[1:04:49] he says when i we says when i would have
[1:04:51] healed you i found iniquity in you
[1:04:54] then he began talking about a time he
[1:04:56] says when i came to heal you
[1:04:58] i would have healed you but i couldn't
[1:05:00] heal you because you had things in your
[1:05:02] life that wasn't right
[1:05:03] you had things in your life that you
[1:05:05] needed to set your house in order
[1:05:07] so we had to deal with those things
[1:05:09] first before i could bring
[1:05:10] healing in your life and many times god
[1:05:13] want to do things in our life
[1:05:15] is our house in order do we have those
[1:05:17] things right
[1:05:18] i said god let my house be in order let
[1:05:20] me be
[1:05:21] walking that straight in that narrow way
[1:05:23] lord that when you come to heal me i
[1:05:25] won't miss
[1:05:26] my time of visitation many missed the
[1:05:28] time of visitation
[1:05:30] many missed their time god he said when
[1:05:32] i came to heal you i found iniquity in
[1:05:34] you
[1:05:35] come on but we thank the lord tonight
[1:05:37] who says you can't serve two masters
[1:05:40] he says you're gonna you're gonna love
[1:05:42] one
[1:05:43] and you or you're gonna hate the other i
[1:05:46] says
[1:05:48] you know god is so good to us come on
[1:05:52] the bible talk about a time where it'll
[1:05:55] be
[1:05:55] seven i think women it says that they'll
[1:05:58] go out to one man
[1:05:59] it says you know in one place that they
[1:06:02] want to dress themselves and call be
[1:06:05] called by your name but they want to
[1:06:06] address themselves in their own apparel
[1:06:07] they're on the door
[1:06:08] and on a door in apparel but
[1:06:11] god wants you to be clothed and he gives
[1:06:14] you the clothing to be clothed with
[1:06:16] and that is the word how many believe
[1:06:17] that tonight but i want to say
[1:06:20] you can't serve two masters you think
[1:06:22] about that he said you're gonna love one
[1:06:25] and you're gonna hate the elder i said
[1:06:27] god
[1:06:28] what it is i don't wanna despise you
[1:06:30] lord but lord i want to love you with
[1:06:32] all of my heart
[1:06:44] amen
[1:07:06] praise the lord amen we thank the lord
[1:07:10] for the word today
[1:07:14] thank the lord for uh
[1:07:17] brother ernest shared with us today you
[1:07:21] cannot serve
[1:07:22] two masters amen
[1:07:27] you can only love one and hate the other
[1:07:30] so by the grace of god as you look at
[1:07:33] the reality of that
[1:07:35] i thought about
[1:07:40] as he was speaking you cannot
[1:07:45] walk in the spirit
[1:07:48] and walk in the flesh at the same time
[1:07:52] so by the grace of god the bible
[1:07:56] said they are led by the spirit of god
[1:07:58] they're the sons of god
[1:08:00] so you cannot serve two masters
[1:08:05] but we we must understand
[1:08:08] that when we're children sons and
[1:08:11] daughters of god
[1:08:13] and being son and daughter of god then
[1:08:16] god
[1:08:18] leads us by his spirit we know that
[1:08:23] in order to become a son of god then we
[1:08:25] must be born again
[1:08:28] and when we are born again
[1:08:31] by one spirit are you baptized into one
[1:08:34] body
[1:08:36] and the holy ghost come crying out of
[1:08:38] our father
[1:08:41] but a lot of time many christians
[1:08:47] don't understand who the holy ghost is
[1:08:52] they said i got it
[1:08:59] oftentimes people seek for the power
[1:09:02] and for the fire
[1:09:07] a lot of times when people speak of the
[1:09:10] holy ghost
[1:09:10] they think about the power that the holy
[1:09:14] ghost
[1:09:16] has a lot of times you can look at an
[1:09:20] individual that can be strong
[1:09:22] and powerful or very very intelligent
[1:09:27] uh you can look at certain attributes of
[1:09:31] a person
[1:09:33] but the attributes
[1:09:37] is not the
[1:09:40] fullness of the person
[1:09:43] so i'm saying to you the holy ghost
[1:09:47] is jesus the holy ghost is a person
[1:09:53] and a person of jesus christ when he
[1:09:55] comes down inside of you
[1:09:59] you got to realize that he is a person
[1:10:02] he's not a thing he's not just power
[1:10:07] a lot of times we pray for more power
[1:10:11] we want to get stronger
[1:10:14] but we got to realize all the strength
[1:10:16] that we need
[1:10:19] is in the person
[1:10:23] if we have him
[1:10:26] we got the power we got the strength
[1:10:30] but failure to recognize who he is
[1:10:35] that he is a person
[1:10:39] he is christ he said hobbit when he
[1:10:44] the spirit of truth is come he
[1:10:48] where is he that's in you
[1:10:52] the person
[1:10:55] if you have jesus you have access to
[1:10:58] everything he has
[1:11:00] so much and so the prophet god
[1:11:02] oftentimes said all that god was
[1:11:04] he put it into christ and all that
[1:11:08] christ
[1:11:08] was he pulled it into the church
[1:11:13] so if you have all that he had
[1:11:18] because you got the person
[1:11:22] christ is in you the hope of glory
[1:11:27] now he only can express
[1:11:31] himself through you when you can
[1:11:34] recognize who he is see the next time we
[1:11:44] try to do something or behave ourselves
[1:11:46] unseemly
[1:11:48] we got to realize that the person
[1:11:52] christ that's in you
[1:11:56] i think somebody said grieve not the
[1:11:58] holy spirit whereby you're still unto
[1:12:00] the day of redemption
[1:12:04] the very person in you can be grieved
[1:12:09] because he is a person
[1:12:14] god can be touched by the feeling of
[1:12:17] your infirmity
[1:12:20] the bible says jesus got the loudest
[1:12:22] grave and jesus well
[1:12:29] sometimes the condition of mankind is so
[1:12:31] wicked
[1:12:34] to god said it repented me he was
[1:12:36] touched
[1:12:38] because of the condition how about you
[1:12:40] and i the person that
[1:12:42] we carry around with us is just like a
[1:12:44] mother
[1:12:45] with a pregnant with a child amen
[1:12:49] and you and i are pregnant with the word
[1:12:53] amen and we're to bring forth jesus
[1:12:55] christ
[1:12:58] are you with me the very person the very
[1:13:02] god
[1:13:04] brother and sister it's time that we
[1:13:06] recognize
[1:13:08] and we'll not conduct our lives and
[1:13:10] don't we not
[1:13:12] amen that
[1:13:15] he don't exist
[1:13:19] christians save folk holy ghosts field
[1:13:22] folks
[1:13:24] oftentimes conduct their lives and
[1:13:27] things that they do
[1:13:28] the way that they act as though that
[1:13:30] person is not a person
[1:13:33] he's not a he's just a power just a
[1:13:35] stretch but he's a person
[1:13:37] [Music]
[1:13:41] we don't want to do things to cause our
[1:13:43] parents to
[1:13:46] be disappointed in us how about our
[1:13:48] heavenly father
[1:13:53] you said i wouldn't do that in front of
[1:13:55] mama
[1:13:57] i wouldn't do that in front of daddy
[1:14:00] what how about the god that's inside of
[1:14:02] you
[1:14:03] you're doing that in front of him
[1:14:08] are you with me so brother and sister
[1:14:11] let's get a hold
[1:14:13] amen who jesus is
[1:14:16] say he said to peter who do you say that
[1:14:18] i am
[1:14:20] if he's a person then that person if
[1:14:23] he's in you
[1:14:25] i'll tell you brother says this is real
[1:14:27] to me
[1:14:31] can't serve two masters
[1:14:35] the bible said we ought to take jesus
[1:14:38] with us everywhere we go
[1:14:40] everywhere we go and we do as a
[1:14:42] christian we do
[1:14:45] he's with us everywhere we go
[1:14:49] when you wake up in the morning and when
[1:14:52] you're laid out at night
[1:14:54] you ought to take the lord everywhere
[1:14:56] you go
[1:14:58] god bless you now realizing
[1:15:02] that we must yield ourselves in such a
[1:15:04] way
[1:15:06] the very light from the sun
[1:15:11] the moon is reflected in the light of
[1:15:14] the sun
[1:15:16] and the church is reflecting the light
[1:15:18] of the son of god
[1:15:20] are you with me you must be a reflection
[1:15:24] of the light
[1:15:25] not your own light but the light that
[1:15:28] you get from the sun
[1:15:31] are you with me
