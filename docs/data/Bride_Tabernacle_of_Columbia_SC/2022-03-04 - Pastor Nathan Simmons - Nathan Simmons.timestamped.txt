[1:15:40] someone sawing
[1:15:41] he going to church now i'm sitting there
[1:15:43] mean brother something used to run
[1:15:45] together

[1:15:59] i didn't tell the boys that

[1:16:17] and when i decided when god helped me to
[1:16:20] decide
[1:16:22] i talked it over
[1:16:24] with the lord
[1:16:27] me and him had to talk over

[1:16:54] i was known as a fighter here in
[1:16:56] columbia
[1:16:58] years ago before i got like i am today

[1:17:04] ain't too many people could beat me in
[1:17:06] my day
[1:17:08] not boasting up bagging but i'm just
[1:17:10] then you know the truth
[1:17:13] god
[1:17:16] i used to get so upset and marrying
[1:17:18] sometimes
[1:17:19] it used to make me so upset sometimes i
[1:17:21] told him i'd say look at him if you know
[1:17:23] who i was
[1:17:26] you wouldn't do me like that
[1:17:29] because i was a fighter
[1:17:31] a major fighter
[1:17:34] i said you know who i was
[1:17:38] you wouldn't do that
[1:17:41] because you'd be in bad
[1:17:42] shape but since god chained me to a lamb
[1:17:47] and i can't do it no more
[1:17:49] because the holy ghost ain't gonna let
[1:17:50] me do that
[1:17:53] and i repent because i ain't supposed to
[1:17:55] be saying that
[1:17:58] sense of god

[1:36:07] he's i'm a man on fire
[1:36:11] i was on the way to tennessee he called
[1:36:12] me in spartanburg and he
[1:36:15] almost talked me all the way there
[1:36:19] since the symbols called him and said

[1:36:29] he's i got meat she don't know about

[1:36:40] i said well you better keep protocoling
[1:36:42] underneath the maze
[1:36:45] he didn't know she better keep protocol
[1:36:49] he said god is ahead of christ christ

[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:20] amen
[1:37:22] appreciate the word tonight brother
[1:37:24] nathan
[1:37:25] hey man he called me at work
[1:37:28] amen
[1:37:30] he's a brother called i'm on fire
[1:37:34] i said i talked with him a few minutes
[1:37:36] about 30 minutes that's brother nathan i
[1:37:37] could get back out here
[1:37:39] he's okay brother but i i appreciate the
[1:37:42] fight that god has put in his heart
[1:37:45] and like he said a paradox when
[1:37:47] something happens
[1:37:49] to you
[1:37:51] it's personal
[1:37:54] and when you
[1:37:55] have that happen to you
[1:37:58] it generates a combustion chamber of
[1:38:00] love in you
[1:38:02] for what god has done for you
[1:38:05] nobody else he's done it for
[1:38:08] but he done it for you
[1:38:10] and that will
[1:38:11] start a fire
[1:38:14] burning
[1:38:15] on the inside
[1:38:17] as jeremiah said it's like fire
[1:38:21] shut up in my bones i don't want to say
[1:38:23] nothing else
[1:38:24] but jeremiah could not stop talking
[1:38:27] because what was shut up in him
[1:38:30] and god said you will be a witness
[1:38:33] after the holy ghost come upon you
[1:38:36] amen
[1:38:48] brother brad your dad wants you to stand
[1:38:50] up
[1:38:52] so everybody can see
[1:39:00] man praise the lord
[1:39:02] when they said don't call the whole city

[1:40:42] you the truth
[1:40:43] i mean he gonna always tell you the
[1:40:45] truth
[1:40:47] i remember when the lord uh called me to
[1:40:49] the ministry and started ministering the
[1:40:50] gospel
[1:40:52] yeah i've been ministering maybe a
[1:40:53] couple years but i was down in mullins
[1:40:56] and uh i was preaching
[1:40:58] you know it seemed like everybody
[1:41:00] enjoyed the word and all
[1:41:02] brother nathan
[1:41:04] and he got up behind me he said he says
[1:41:07] brother ernest one of them uh he said he
[1:41:09] wanted those nice preachers
[1:41:12] he said see

[1:41:17] he said we gonna tell you you know he
[1:41:19] said he told you but we gonna tell you
[1:41:21] but one thing i know i know like i said
[1:41:23] with my brother nathan he gonna tell you
[1:41:25] the truth
[1:41:26] and i can always respect the man like
[1:41:28] that
[1:41:29] because he that's his heart right there
[1:41:32] and i i i can say right now you know i
[1:41:35] never never
[1:41:37] out all the years
[1:41:39] one thing about it
[1:41:40] he always had a love of god in his heart
[1:41:43] always opened his home to me me and his
[1:41:45] children grew up together all of us were
[1:41:48] good all are still good friends you know
[1:41:50] but
[1:41:51] i just say i always been blessed by his
[1:41:53] ministry even here tonight i i kind of
[1:41:56] wonder myself i told my wife i says he
[1:41:58] called and i says you know i hope
[1:42:00] nothing ain't going on with them
[1:42:02] i told my wife that i said lord i hope
[1:42:04] nothing ain't going on with them i was
[1:42:07] telling uh i don't know if you remember
[1:42:09] me telling him about telling him and i
[1:42:10] was talking to
[1:42:12] brother simmons here i i said you know i
[1:42:14] i pray that the lord
[1:42:17] he thought terry he couldn't get all of
[1:42:18] us
[1:42:19] i said because
[1:42:21] i don't want i
[1:42:23] see i love the old saints
[1:42:25] i love the old ministry the old
[1:42:27] ministers
[1:42:28] the old old soldiers
[1:42:30] because i said that they're the ones
[1:42:33] right now that when i talk about the
[1:42:34] pillars
[1:42:36] come on i said that that's what we need
[1:42:38] today i always preaching here lately i
[1:42:40] said god we need another revival like we
[1:42:42] had in the days of old
[1:42:44] the one that i the revivals that i grew
[1:42:47] up on
[1:42:48] how i seen and how to fear god was on
[1:42:51] the people not that they was afraid of
[1:42:53] the ministry but they saw god in the in
[1:42:56] the church
[1:42:57] and i said lord that's what
[1:42:59] uh the young people need to see today
[1:43:02] you know i got young people i got young
[1:43:03] children growing up to be teenagers and
[1:43:06] you know they start and experience
[1:43:08] things and the things they dealing with
[1:43:10] i ain't had to deal with
[1:43:12] the things they're exposed to i wasn't
[1:43:14] exposed to
[1:43:15] so how how much more we need god in a
[1:43:19] supernatural way now more than we ever
[1:43:21] did
[1:43:22] to watch over our children because we
[1:43:24] can't guard them but i said and that's
[1:43:26] what i've been praying that's what's
[1:43:27] been in my heart i said lord we need a
[1:43:30] old-fashioned
[1:43:32] holy ghost revival
[1:43:33] not just a meeting church service and
[1:43:35] all that that's that's good but god we
[1:43:38] need change that's what we need and uh
[1:43:41] and i know that the only way that's
[1:43:43] gonna come is gonna have to come by god
[1:43:45] and god alone
[1:43:46] because that's what happened to me
[1:43:48] i always shared a testimony
[1:43:51] i always said that when i got saved i
[1:43:53] used to pray and i said lord i need i
[1:43:56] need the holy ghost
[1:43:58] because i'm afraid of myself
[1:44:00] i don't even know what i'm capable of
[1:44:02] because what it is
[1:44:04] you know i grew up in a church
[1:44:06] under all the word and all
[1:44:08] but you don't think sometimes you'll get
[1:44:10] that far
[1:44:12] but what happens you just stay on the
[1:44:14] outskirts and what happens the devil get
[1:44:16] hold to you
[1:44:18] and he carries you out there so far too
[1:44:19] you don't even know how you're going to
[1:44:20] get back
[1:44:22] i remember i was riding with my mom in
[1:44:24] the car and i broke down crying because
[1:44:26] i had
[1:44:27] people calling me
[1:44:28] 7 16 17 years old with death threats and
[1:44:31] stuff
[1:44:32] threatening they gonna do all kind of
[1:44:34] stuff for me so i i told my mom i never
[1:44:37] intended to get where i am right now but
[1:44:40] you know nobody never does
[1:44:42] but i thank god i had a praying mama
[1:44:45] not only a praying mama i had a praying
[1:44:48] uh a grandmom i had a praying church
[1:44:50] that stayed on the altar praying because
[1:44:52] i know that the prayers of god brought
[1:44:54] me through
[1:44:55] people always talk about
[1:44:57] you know
[1:44:58] and i know that like we say that i tell
[1:45:00] my wife all the time i know i'm
[1:45:02] long-winded but i tell my wife all the
[1:45:04] time
[1:45:05] like what the lord has blessed us with
[1:45:08] you know i never in in a million years
[1:45:11] could imagine what god has done for us
[1:45:15] so many supernatural things
[1:45:17] i can't stand before you and say bye
[1:45:19] nothing that i've done that i got
[1:45:21] anything that i got or achieved anything
[1:45:23] or been blessed with i know that it's
[1:45:25] only been by the grace of god
[1:45:28] because when i look at so many that i
[1:45:30] walk with and where they are now i was
[1:45:33] talking to someone the other day
[1:45:35] and i said i said i was sharing with
[1:45:37] them i said i can't look down on you i
[1:45:39] said because it was only the grace of
[1:45:41] god in my life and i said that if you
[1:45:43] got a desire to be saved that same grace
[1:45:46] is still here for you today no matter
[1:45:48] where you are or what you've done just
[1:45:50] to even have the desire i said all you
[1:45:53] got to do is give it to god come on and
[1:45:55] let god let god uh have his way in your
[1:45:57] life and that's my desire i pray so i
[1:46:00] thank god for brother nathan like i said
[1:46:03] tonight he's all he always been a
[1:46:04] blessing to me and he he knows that he
[1:46:07] always welcome you know
[1:46:09] all the time i thank the lord for him
[1:46:11] like it says if if you don't want the
[1:46:14] truth then don't ask him
[1:46:16] because he gonna give you the truth
[1:46:18] i was telling somebody that the other
[1:46:20] day when they was wanting to
[1:46:22] speak with the bishop
[1:46:24] i told him i said if you don't want the
[1:46:26] truth
[1:46:26] then don't ask it
[1:46:29] but if you want the truth
[1:46:30] then i i know they'll give you the truth
[1:46:33] how many believe that tonight
[1:46:35] [Applause]
[1:46:40] praise god
[1:46:44] we thank god
[1:46:46] i said we're in revival but
[1:46:49] i'm sorry to say
[1:46:51] time
[1:46:53] let's come to the end
[1:46:56] if god don't have mercy
[1:47:02] america
[1:47:03] will be blowed to pieces
[1:47:06] that's the seventh vision
[1:47:09] whether we believe
[1:47:12] the prophet or not
[1:47:14] if the bombs fall
[1:47:17] it was after
[1:47:19] they had pierced his side
[1:47:22] and had killed him
[1:47:26] and the darkness covered the place
[1:47:29] somebody said truly
[1:47:32] this was the son of god
[1:47:37] that seven vision the sixth vision
[1:47:41] a woman vice president of president
[1:47:44] the seven he saw america being blown to
[1:47:46] pieces
[1:47:48] by russia
[1:47:52] whether he's false or true
[1:47:55] time might tell it in a few days
[1:48:01] time might tell it in a few days but
[1:48:04] somebody wake up and say oh
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:08] he was telling the truth
[1:48:11] but where would we be
[1:48:13] see i didn't believe it
[1:48:15] it's like the young lady
[1:48:17] at brother thompson
[1:48:19] the nurse was in the room
[1:48:22] the doctor pulled the cover back and
[1:48:24] said

[1:48:36] believing with them they said go out
[1:48:38] there and tell them
[1:48:40] that
[1:48:41] she brain dead if she come out of it she
[1:48:43] ain't gonna be number the vegetable you
