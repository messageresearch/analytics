God and we can benefit from that presence bless us God tonight strengthen us Lord Heal us I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen we want to look at the Book of Luke by God's grace Luke 4. and we'll begin at the 14th verse Luke 4 and 14. and it reads and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a Fame of him through all of the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and his cut as his custom he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiahs and when he had opened the book he found a place wherein where it is written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he have sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear witness and all bear him witness and he wondered and wondered the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said it's not this Joseph's son and he said unto them you will surely say unto me this proverb position to heal thyself whatsoever We Have Heard done in Capernaum do also here in that country and he said unto him and he said verily I say unto you no Prophet that's except in his own country but I tell you the truth many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias wherein the heavens was shut up three years and six months when Great Famine was throughout all the land but none of them was Elias sent save unto serp to a city in of Asylum unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in Israel at the time of Elijah's the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian and all the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath and Rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him away to the bow to the brow of the Hill wherein their city was built that they might cast him down headlong but he passing through the midst of them with his way may God is a blessed reading of this word maybe see it tonight by God's grace just for a moment I want to minister on a type on a topic and I entitled it the times are changing amen the times are changing you know just just looking here and things been on my heart you know I was saying that you know we're living in some unstable times we're living in a time where where everyone seems to be searching for stability but they can't find none nowhere the whole world like we say is is falling or already falling apart and that's why they in the point now where they say is we just got to open everything back up just let everything go back to being as it was no matter what the outcome is we're going to have to try to force our way back to the way things used to be but as I say tonight the times are changing the world I believe that as we saw it before it'll never be the same we'll never be at a force our way back into the the old uh away or the way things were for one it's because of fear it has gripped the people's hearts in such a way that the people themselves they don't know what to do you know some have just uh uh well we would say take a fanatical Approach at it and then some are just grip so much in fear it's just no uh stability everywhere everybody's looking for answers everybody's looking for a a a a a resolution or some resolve to the present-day crisis they're looking for the antidote they're looking for a way to get the economy back on track they're looking for something that's going to just uh when everything is in a panic they're looking for something to come and stabilize us again but I want to say you know it just says in the Bible it says that go to heaven and earth uh will pass away he said that my word won't pass away I believe that he says that if you to the man in Psalms 1 that would keep his word he said that man would be like a tree planted by the rivers of Living Waters that man he won't be able to be moved I come to the point you know in my life looking at you know things and looking at the uncertainty other times and the unstability of that we're seeing today and I says you know the only stability the only thing that we're going to find that's going to keep us together in these uncertain times is going to be Christ and Christ himself not just some form of religion not just some church but it's going to have to be a Christ and him alone it's times past that we just see the word and just have good sermons or just read and and just have what they would say just a letter because the Bible says that the letter will kill you but the spirit will give you life it cometh it's a time and the time I believe is now where we should see the scriptures uh coming alive we should see the the spirit of God uh through the Holy Ghost uh taking the word and quickening it and that way we can actually draw the benefits from it because we're living in a time where we need the benefits from the word of God we need I believe that the Bible says when Jesus here was coming back out of the Wilderness that's what the Prelude was he was coming back out of the Wilderness the Bible says he was filled with the spirit and the power of God it wasn't that he was just uh uh just ready just to go to church uh just to have start back having church again and saying like that but it was something about it the church world as they noted of that day was about to change it was no longer just reading the Scrolls and all those things now the Living Word was among them but they wasn't ready for and that's what I said tonight the times are changing come on you know and and we we have the world has a struggle with with or they would call it change sometimes because they might have found themselves comfortable just where they were at comfortable in the condition they were in comfortable in going in and coming out but God does some things a lot of times as we say the sturdiness they get you out of that comfort zone because he wants to let you know that hey that comfort zone that you're in that's not a real security things are about to change and if you don't change with the times then what's going to happen you're going to spiritually die not only will you spiritually dive but in this time you might physically die why because not understanding what God is doing in this day that's what they're like we always uh uh uh that's what I was saying on the other week uh last week it was I said you know Jesus said that the word of God is a sea come on and I say as we being Ministers of the Gospel we always desire that when we minister in the word we know and then succeed but we know it takes something to bring that seed to life so as we speak in the word we always desire that that seed would fall on good ground would fall on ground that it can bring forth uh the potential that's lying in that seed it's a it's sometimes uh discourage a man that he knows that the word can help you or can help an individual but they won't take the word they won't eat the word they won't live in the word so it's a discouragement sometimes he stay on his knee crying so he said Lord I know that you your word can help I know that God if people would quit putting their trust in men putting their trust in everything else God and begin to looking up to you God that you can do something special for him you can get them away from all those sleepless nights you can know God brings stability to their life of fear and and shame God but Lord as we minister in the word you you want the seed to go out and bring forth you want it you want the ground uh to be right you God I believe loves to see hearts that's broken and that's why a lot of times what he does he points out our era he points out the faults and the things in our life to do what to break up the ground not only to break up the ground and not give you something but he breaks that ground up because he wants to plant a seed in there he wants to plant something in your heart that when it begins to grow then it begins to bring forth and that seed that type of life or that God plants in there then that's the genuine life the life of of God himself I believe which comes through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's what it is we all desire that but we're talking about tonight the times are changing come on there was always things that happened in the world that have such impacts on the world that the world of the earth will never be the same again afterwards you know and we can look at many examples we look at the the era when when the cars come about then you know the planes come about but one of the one of the things I always like to look at was how you know the atomic weapons when they when they were beginning to be uh created and all these things it was a one of the great scientists of that day Robert Oppenheimer tonight you know that they detonated the first atomic bomb him in a uh a couple of other Lily horn and a couple other scientists you know they said within themselves you know they begin to quote this quote from a poet and they said have become deaf they'll destroy your worlds and I remember Lenny hornan saying that that night the scientists knew that the world that we knew it as before would never be the same why because now that they've just tapped into a a space in time to where they've been to where they've created something that could potentially destroy man off the face of the Earth and what it was they realized that the times that they used to live in before that night it wouldn't be the same after that day they knew that the world was changing but they said the majority of the world didn't know that it was changing they said that even America itself in the government they didn't realize just just how much the world had changed overnight but they understood it because it was something that gripped them and that's what it is we find today you know I don't believe that the whole world as a whole understand what's taking place only a few I believe the Bible says that straight is a gate narrowers away but only a few there'll be that find it I believe when Jesus walked the the Earth in his time you know even though things were changing even though the world would never be the same everybody didn't know and only a few knew it only a few knew what was taking place and to not know what's taking place in that time or past you and you'll be unaware you'll be living in a day that that's beyond the time that you're living in you won't understand what God is doing so we find that and I said just like they they says that the world in itself didn't understand just the change I was going through and I say it's God that's what it is I believe that you look at here you know in the scriptures how all the time when when the angel in looking Book of Revelation when he when the angel had an announcement to make he would make us announcement but even though that announcement will go out the whole world might heard it but in that announcement he would say he that happened here let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches come on because even though things would be transferring and taking place before the people only those that had an ear would be able to hear it only those that had their eyes anointed what I say I would be able to see it and how does that come about you can't intellectually uh uh see these things you can't uh through your own ability hear these things but it takes uh Christ himself it takes you being sold out to God allowing his Spirit to come and fill you up come on change you from the way that you are shake you away from your condition or your life becoming a new creature in Christ that that's what uh uh uh made the difference that's why Jesus was told the disciples many times you don't understand what I'm saying right now he says but when the comforter come when the Holy Ghost come in my name he said then you'll understand these things I remember he told our Nicodemus he said except the man be born again he can't even see the kingdom of God come on we know that he he can't understand it he don't even know what it's all about come on Nicodemus you a Pharisee you're a preacher you one that know the the book intellectually in and out but yet you still have no understanding of what's taking place you can't see the kingdom of God you don't understand it without the Holy Ghost but what we find today that people downplay the Holy Ghost so much they downplayed the literal life of Jesus Christ coming in you they taking it and made it a shout they taken it and made it a dance so just speaking in tongues but there's no life-changing experience there's no power behind it there's nothing quickening down on the inside that's gonna bring the word to life but that's what God is getting us to that's what we need today somebody that's got a home to the spirit of God that when they read the word they can see where they are they can hear what the spirit is saying to them Hallelujah and I find that I said God that's what it is he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying it takes the Holy Ghost to hear what the spirit is saying it takes the Holy Ghost to see that the times are changing what's taking place without that you'll be left out without that you'll be struggling you'll get deceived when it's passed out but you'll be like those by the wayside or those that's on the Stony ground of those that's planted among thorns and thistles never be able to bring forth the The Life of Christ never be able to to to uh bring forth the full manifestation that you know I said one thing about God God I say he wants to get all all out of you that he can come on he wants to get all of you all that he can I believe you know when you when a man comes to God he ought to make it up in his mind that Lord whatever it takes God I want to give you all of me God whatever I got to give up Lord I'm ready to give up Lord whatever I got to sacrifice Here I Am Lord not my will but let thy will be done in my life God I'm giving you all of me and then when it happens the Holy Ghost comes down and he's a teacher he begins to teach you all things he begins to show you how to walk like Christ how to act like Christ how to live like Christ why because it's him in you that is taking over and I believe that hallelujah what we need now more than anything is Christ uh to take over our lives they engulf Us in such a way so we become dead and all that all that we live is only geared towards him I believe that with all of my heart but we find that like we say is now the the times are changing like it says you know we look at it and I know the prophet of God is talking about you know he call it the Junctions of time times are changing come on times it has been that way ever since the world began you know ever since time began things would happen in the earth and the world just says they know that it would never be the same ever again it would be a turning point and it always was a struggle for those that was caught in that Turning Point that was in right in the middle of it because like it says only a few would be able to understand what was taking place and they would make it through that Junction and then you would have those that would die in the in the middle of the junction but you have those that they just wouldn't receive it I think about you know I says that even though when these great things are happening in the earth we can look all through the scriptures if the Bible says in Amos uh three and seven surely the Lord God would do nothing but reveal its secrets to his servant of prophets before God bring judgment he always gives you a space of Mercy a space or a time where he allows the people to come to repentance and I said that even though God generally gives the people a space to repent a lot of times the people still won't repent they still want to live in their ways still want a little sinful lives still want to carry on just as things were come on but God brings us to a stopping point sometimes and says I want you to hold on for a while consider your ways come on repent get back to me that's what God does sometimes we find that here that we say as the times are changing we find that Noah you know in his day the times were changing come on the Bible says that the men's heart was on evil and evil continually the Bible says that the imagination on every man's heart was on evil continually they were they were marrying and drinking and giving and married all these things and they were going doing all these things and God got tired of it one day and the times were about to change God but not only like I said where the times were changing God gave them a space there I believe that God God gave them a way of Escape come on no doubt when God he the Bible says that Noah found Grace in Eyes Of God come on and that's what it's about even though the times are getting ready to change God is still going to give somebody some Grace Hallelujah I thank God even in the hour that we living in come on don't don't shun the grace of God don't shun your opportunity your space and time to get your soul right your space and time that God has given you to repent you'll look back on that day one day and wish you had a took seize to that opportunity you'll look back one day and wish you would have heeded the call Hallelujah I believe that but we find that like I said as in that day Noah you know him building the art God told him it's going to rain here I'm building the ark and I and I says you know even in that you know no doubt people witness Noah building the ark no doubt they witnessed something great happening in their day but you know they were too caught up with their with their drinking they were too caught up with the lives they were living they were too caught up with the imagination and thoughts and all these things are going out just living the next day that they didn't want to uh uh really receive it that times was about to change the world as they knew it will never be the same no more the flood was coming and if you didn't get in the heart you was going to die in your sins and I said that you know when Noah he he him and his family they got on in the ark no doubt you know the people they witnessed it some say Noah preached to him but no doubt they witnessed it no doubt they they they saw that and that sign that God gave them was going to be a judgment to them in the end but they find that like I said they they were so caught up to what they were doing they didn't understand that after tomorrow we'll say it like that the world will never be the same when the rain began to fall all that we known of it was the past it was gonna never be the same ever again it was a turning point now God got tired of it and he said now it's time to make some changes you know many people they don't look at God's judgment they said God wouldn't come on God get tired of sin sometimes God get tired of the way the church world is today God get tired of people coming in and out and won't repent God get tired of people not trusting him he gets tired of people not calling on his name and sometimes he brings a change sometimes God brings a a turning point in our lives but we find that I said that the times are changing but we know that even though the times were changing before judgment came God brought Mercy we look at in the days of in the days of Abraham the times were about to change come on when lot knows I mean down in Sodom and Gomorrah and the filth and the things that were going on in the world come on but after that it was after that day after a certain time the world that they know it wasn't going to be the same no more but it was going to always be in a remembrance of man that you had a world so wicked I mean a city's so wicked in the earth that God himself came down to destroy could that happen again today could it will we come to a time that not just a city but we can be living in a world so insane you look at the news a lot of times it breaks your heart the seed to the extent people would go to the morals of of the world itself how low they've gotten some of the old-timers might look and say they never thought they'd see a world where the the people would be so insane but that they've witnessed that the times have changed you say is it drugs is it alcohol I say it's demon powers I said Spirits lurking in the Earth today that sometimes we don't know nothing about that's why it takes the spirit of God Sheltering us and keeping us away from all danger hurting harm I pray to myself I said Lord I don't have to understand just the severity sometimes of what's going on out there but keep my eyes on you Lord I believe when when Jesus was meeting Peter on the water uh uh um it wasn't about the winds and the waves only thing he had to do was keep his eyes on Jesus because when he got to seeing the severity of the storm then his heart began to fail for fear and that's what it is we're not looking at the severity of the storm I don't know about you my brother or sister but I'm looking to the Hills from which cometh my help I'm looking for Christ himself to return again and take us home I believe that but we find today what's happening like we say the times are changing I thought about that I says that you know the Angels came down and you know that's something about it at each Junction of time when major things are happening in the earth don't you know Angels start appearing God himself will come down he's already here you say he'll come down he's already here but Supernatural things will take place as well as we say when the when the enemy come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him I thank God that his Spirit still will combat the devil I thank God that his spirit is still fighting for us his spirit is still raising us up above all our enemies I had a dream the other day and things were taking place and and in the dream the Lord was showing me he says every time man thinks he outsmart me or every time man think he got your demon the powers look like they going over floodger he said I'm gonna raise you up here I'ma keep raising you up just above all of that don't you worry about it you just keep your eyes on me and I was so stirred when I woke up out of the dream I said Lord that's what it is why don't we fret why are we in fear knowing that God is going to take care of us Romans we keep our hands in the Master's hands as long as we walk with him and allow him to have his way in our lives I ain't worried about the storms what it is we gonna ride On Eagle's Wings that anointing that God has sent in this hour is going to take us up out of our troubles out of all our trials God said he wouldn't let him overtake you come on but we find I said times are changing we look at that we look at you know there's so many examples that we can go through in the scriptures but time we know that they would fail us you know to even uh try to touch the surface of the things that the Lord had put on our hearts but I said times was changing come on things are taking place in the earth and you know what it is like like me and uh brother Simmons was talking before service the people what it is they they show us they trying to force the economy back up Force they say come on we got to have church don't matter if another outbreak come we can't afford what it is they gonna try to they want to force their way back into the hot Wars my wife was telling me about the school system and all of the the uh things the guidelines and stuff now that they want for the children for the next school year it'll be almost impossible to keep those guidelines the way they'll try to keep the things from breaking out you know they were saying that over in France they tried to start the school system back up but they had an outbreak in the schools but what it is the world is is what uh they're living in fear you know they're living in fear they don't know what to do so what they want to do is just sometimes you can be like playing a game or watching a video or something they want to hit the reset button they want to start all over they want to just start oh come on let's start it all over but it ain't no reset button there ain't no starting all over I I believe that come on but we find that now like we said times is changing and if times are changing God what are you doing come on it'll be who's each and every one of us to be on our knees asking God what God what are you doing not to think that we understand everything fully in entirety but God I know you're doing something and Lord whatever you're doing in this season Lord don't do it without me God what am I missing don't let me just uh walking and go and just think that oh everything will get back it'll soon pass but we know that they said soon that it says when safety uh is coming in sudden Destruction has come come on because Matthew uh 24. they say peace peace with certain instruction come on I think that was it but God is good amen Thessalonians God is good I get mixed up sometime we say Google messed us up hey sharp as we used to be amen but God is good but we find that what God is doing like we said times are changing come on things are happening where sometimes I remember uh Russell Simmons preaching a sermon uh once that where are we come on he said because sometimes you can be out on the trip you lost your road map you turned around the room then you you say hey the question come out where are we you might stop by the gas station and ask somebody hey where are where am I where are we come on and sometimes even in times we have in time we have to get on our knees and ask God just where are we lord what am I you say Lord what am I looking for next we know we're looking for the coming of the Lord but Lord where am I just in time you know Jesus here in the scriptures you know I I like that how John the Baptist even before Jesus came they asked him they said who are you he said I'm divorcing one crying in the wilderness John knew who he was John knew where he was in time and he can point to that place and says I'm I'm preparing the way of the Lord he's soon to come he says I'm not the one but I'm preparing away for him he says there's one among you right now and he was sure of that come on why he knew where he was in time he knew his hour he knew his date he knew what was happening around him come on so he can identify just where he was I think about you know uh in in that time what happened the scriptures were coming alive and Jesus here when he come into the and back from the Wilderness and the Bible says that the fame went about went abroad because he was Healing The Sick he was doing all these things these Miracles and stuff and when he went back to his hometown come on I believe that he was his message to them we know it was a repent and the Kingdom of Heaven is subtly upon you but we know that entirely what we say just paraphrasing it his message to them was the times are changing things that you knew it as before come on the times have changed now but the church World couldn't accept it they couldn't accept that they weren't going to be able to just come in the church and read the Scrolls and just go on about sacrificing but Jesus says that this day in your ears what you've been reading about what you've been looking for what you should have been preparing for now is fulfilled in your ears come on this day is what he says times have changed the Bible says that they got so mad with him that they LED them out they threw them out of the city they LED them to a place to throw them down on top of his head why they didn't want to accept that the world was changing that the Messiah had come they didn't understand it fully in its entirety and Jesus said and he came he just stopped it there and said he came and preached an acceptable year of the Lord didn't go on into judgment but the acceptable year the things that were rejected at once God was getting ready to receive now he was getting ready to accept and I'm so glad he did I'm so glad that when we were lost and being Gentile dogs without hope that God made a way that we can get back to him he made a way that we and I can be linked up to him I thank God how many thank God for that so good come on the times we say that the times they were changing come on something great had happened in the Earth and him going up to Calvary was going to be the climax come on let's stand after that because you know I like how I said that when Christ was crucified and his blood was shed says that that that release God come on the life that was in that blood was able to come back on you and I all before the the the Bloods of bulls and goats and all those things were just a shadow of it they could only you know uh cover your sins or just make an atonement from year to year but every year you had to go back but when uh to make an atonement but when Christ died and his blood was shed come on when once you received that life and once you repented of your sins were baptized in his name come on in the Life of Christ which is the Holy Ghost come back on you he that's a sign that God has accepted you come on and when God has accepted you it don't matter if the whole world has rejected you come on I believe I believe it was Paul that said if God be forced and who can be against us when God as they shut at you he's put his sample approval on your life it doesn't matter you might look like a uh you defeated in this life you might not have looked like the best thing in this life but you are more than conquerors you got something that's going to get you out of the Grave one day you got something that's going to help you step out of time and back into eternity what it is Christ himself come down in you I thank God for it I thank God what he's done hallelujah come on the times are changing Jesus breaking down to him come on it looks like you know the people should have been rejoiced and I think about something my grandmother said uh a couple of weeks ago I was talking right on the phone she got so stirred and she's about speaking in tongues on the phone and praising God and as she told me she said she said Jermaine she said I apologize she said I'm sorry she said but this is food for my soul that's what she said this is food for my soul she said I can't help myself she said things I've been serving God for all my life I'm seeing it manifest now and I said God thank you I said you know that's what it is you know when God is revealing stuff when you genuinely see when the spirit of God open your eyes and you can see what God is doing you can see the transition that God is bringing you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light something should take place in your soul it should be food for your soul it should cause you to be beside yourself it should stir you up because now you know that you're transitioning you're going someplace in God and I thank God but we find that he says the times are changing Jesus you know here like we say is uh uh uh um the people of that day they couldn't understand it and then they maybe had you know questions and all these things but Jesus I believe that he can discern their very thoughts he says I know what you're gonna say you're gonna say this you're gonna say well you did all these other wonders and miracles we'll do one now in front of us he says but then he began to bring up to them that's one thing about it you know and that's what he says what where where sometimes you know the word can be misrepresented where we can talk about change and we can talk about the time is changing that that's not saying that that the time is changing away from the Holiness the time is changing away from the Holy Ghost that's still the message or the living right come on or conducting yourself as a Christian should conduct yourself or get loose because God no God ain't changing like that he said I'm the Lord to not change not well that which has been is now come on we know that the times don't when we say times are changing God is still his word so even though Jesus came to break that down to them he took them back to the scriptures he still never never got away from the word it was still the word come on it was still right but he came to show them that what you saw in Shadow now I am the manifestational I'm I'm the reality of the shadow that you saw come on and that's what it is Christ even today he's not I mean when we come to Minnesota the word can be misrepresented come on God ain't just they ain't just letting this word down like that come on it's still right God is still holy God is still requiring the same thing but what it is he's elevating you and I in the spirit to a place the way we can actually see the Fulfillment of the word in our day see what God is doing come on and understand you know where you are come on you're like like you said that tree planted by the rivers of water you can't be moved uh uh you you know where you are come on I can see that Jesus coming and showing how he was a fulfillment of that what you heard come on he was the Fulfillment of that times were changing I said when the times have changed when the times was changing a lot of times you know those that were part of it and I said it they they had a The Junction they had struggles sometimes in in the midst of it they had struggles in the midst of them but I said it's what it is you know one day like we said as we know it even as time it won't be time no longer but we'll be back into eternity and I believe that that's what we all looking and longing for it was just gripping my heart so to just see how every Everybody Wants to Gear Up Everybody Wants things to go back to normal come on and no doubt we we desire to be able to come in the house of God and worship freely and things with even within ourselves but we have to say Lord whatever you're doing God don't let me be uh Mr move or what you're doing today well God I want to be a part of that move Lord God whatever you're doing the times are changing amen praise God times are changing amen I thought about the Reformation amen I thought about Lutheran zingly and and then I thought about the different ones so God that was back there John Hudson those who come in beforehand and preparing the way the Catholic church had the people in such a dark state and then Luther had came forth preaching to just shall live by faith it was a time of change he meant the Reformation had come to bring light to the word the people amen was no longer they had to sit there in darkness amen so by the grace of God and the time change the world Amen what's under the control of a system but no longer amen people start fighting deliverances come there must be a people on the Earth amen that's gonna amen that's going to be ready for the challenge of the hour amen everything that comes to pass then there's got to be a people amen that's going to meet the challenge and I believe that God always had a witness he never left himself without a witness he had a people on the Earth amen that was going to take hold to the word and take a stand for God didn't we find that at the the Luther in that came before the Wesleyan and the different ones and times were changing I believe that amen after Wesley and the methodists and the different ones nazarenes and everybody I believe that um Seymour on Azusa Street came forth with the baptism of the Holy Ghost fallen on Azusa Street the world Amen had come into a cycle of time where we find that machines will begin the factories and cars and all of that began to come forward so by the grace of God times were changing things were speeding up getting faster now we are even in a faster pace the computers are getting faster faster everything is moving faster faster speeding up for what where are we going praise God I believe they're trying to break into eternity and I believe that praise God God has his angels to block man to break it into that dimension because man is trying to break into something he don't know what he's trying to do but he's trying to break into but by the grace of God I thank God that the people of God is on should be on another level the church is on one level but the Bride of Jesus Christ should have that double potion of spirit and she has another lever I listened to how amen the world comes out with their message and their songs and in their worship but I believe that the God has a dang and anointed singles that's going to break into that spirit and they're gonna get a revelation of what God is saying and they're going to put it to music and in the songs but they themselves got to break into amen the place where God is to understand what God is doing praise God the Holy Ghost amen is available to give us a place that we can go in and amen need of the Hidden matter praise God go back amen and bring it back to the people because we entered into a place Lord have mercy there must be a southern noun in our spirit where we must settle down in our spirit where we can hear from God and God can speak to us and God can deal with our lives and God can do things for us amen got to get a place where we can hear what God wants done and what God wants to say I believe will depend on others but we got to say God what you want to do with me as an individual me Lord I want to be there I believe too many times amen will follows but the Bible said they are led by the spirit of God they're the sons of God I believe God is looking for people to that he can lead [Music] that he can take you to the place where you need to be in him I believe we've been too long of just amen going through the motion not hearing God's voice not hearing God speak to us but I believe we'll come to a time that we got to settle down and say God speak to my heart speak to me Lord I want to know what you want done with the word it's time Lord I want to be used by you I want to please your God amen this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell I believe he wants to say here ye him hear ye the bride hear ye hymn amen but we got to be his spiritual condition that God can even speak through us and use us brother and sisters time that we wake up and amen settle down and get a loan with God and say God uh speak to me Lord I need to hear your voice Lord oh if we ever needed to get along with God we need to get along with God now the world is going back even in this time of troubled time and the viruses people don't know which way to turn and said uh mentally Gathering brother Ernest I said I'm gonna tell you something the country cannot afford to shut down because if it's shut down too long we won't have in a country we've lived in a certain way and we'll condition ourselves to live in a certain way that if we shut down too long everything is going to fall apart already man can't pay the tax they're losing millions and millions and millions of dollars how can the system still run when we're losing so much money printing money that we don't have how far can we go in debt to some way it is enough it's over when will we give up and said it's over we finish [Music] can you can you get these dreams back where you gonna get them from where are we gonna how are we going to do it how are we going to recover it's only one way we can recover is turn back to God that we'll turn to God then I know that God can help us but if we won't turn to God then there must be a Superman to come on the scene a Superman with the answer that means that the Antichrist is just run around the corner and when the Antichrist show up the people have a need in the Antichrist got the answer the people are willing to receive their Superman as the world is getting ready to receive that Superman then the super race got to come on the scene you got to earnestly seek God with all your heart I said God Amen I want to be ready because when this Spirit of antichrist come I want to be able to recognize that spirit [Music] and I want to be ready to take a stand for the word Brothers right around the corner sisters right around the corner will you be ready to take a stand for God [Music] not when we so laid back and relax till we get on our knees and begin to cry out to God the world's saying we we got pleasure that we gotta have we can't afford to be afraid of the virus we got to go to the beach we got to go to party the Christians are saying we can't go to church the world is saying I'm not afraid the Christians are saying I'm scared I'm saying it's got to be a balance somewhere We're Not Afraid to go to work not afraid to go to the grocery store put on our mass and go right ahead I'm not Talent folk what to do but I'ma tell you you can't do God in any kind of way and get by with it you got to pray and be loud by the spirit each individual the pastor is not your Holy Ghost the church is not your Holy Ghost coming to a time where it's you and God it's you as an individual being led by the spirit not man but for the spirit not what the pastor say but what God said to you as an individual be wise as a servant harmless as a dove God wants you to do something and for him brother and sister let's not play games and think that we can just relax sometimes let's not play games with our soul because what we do God is looking at us and he's seeing how lots and how lazy we are in the spirit instead of getting closer to God look like we're getting farther away from God brother and sister we need to get closer I noticed in our home we gather around and my wife is saying why you know the children and everybody's here and we're having these Bible studies and see she said honey you're enjoying yourself
