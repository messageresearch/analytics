pray God that you would just be with your people this morning Lord we know there's trouble in the landlord and father we ask you oh God this oh God violence all over the land and death killing and murdering and Lord God that looks like oh God it's just a great terminal down in Alabama and in Louisville and different places God that people are just gone oh God insanities hit the earth father but Lord we look to you this morning God that you would touch Our Lives father give us purpose oh God that we could come closer to you and serve you with all of our hearts Lord may you bless your word now Lord thank you for touching the sick and Afflicted God and confident that would read in Jesus name we pray amen the book of Hebrews 6 chapter Hebrews 6. and 13. he says when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I would bless thee and multiply and I would multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he attained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and of of confirmation is to them and end of all Strife when God willing more bullet lead is shown to the ears of Promise the immutability of his cancer confirmed it by an oath and that by two immutable things which it is impossible for God to lie we might have strong consolation who have fled for refuse to lay hold upon the hopes set before us which hope we have as an ankle of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entered into that within the veil where whether the Forerunner for us entered even Jesus made and high priests Forever After The Order Of mckessidan God bless you to work you may be seated foreign we thought this morning I I wanted to talk about the promised land and and what promises we have in Christ Jesus for our promised land is that God made a promise to us of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that promise of the Holy Ghost is not only amen for amen this life but he promised eternal life and the Holy Ghost is uh just a down payment just an earnings of our inheritance what God would give to us that put our trust and our confidence in him and so we talked about the promises of God God made a promise and we said that God made a promise in Hebrews says that God promises impossible for God to tell us a lie it's impossible for God to lie if God told you amen promises nothing it's impossible for God to lie and God because of his power and who he is he's able to keep his promise amen he's able to fulfill what he promised you and I amen God is good amen and we'll trusting that you would put your confidence in God that he will fulfill his promises but it's a lot of things if I was down on my knees praying this morning and I got up and you know and I I said uh some of it was yesterday when we were in proud and I said is it is it worth what God promised us is it worth it because a lot of times you know people can promise you something amen and you know and sometimes if we want what they promise then we'll uh trust and be an expectation of it you know somebody said well I promise I'll buy you a car when you get 18. and uh so the children are looking anticipating only uh uh upon you know good behavior and you keep your grades up in school and so forth and that you will get this uh so you're looking forward to it so you try to keep your grades up and your behavior and your conduct of life because I'm expecting to get a car at 18. amen well what if a child just do all kind of crazy stuff and amen don't keep the grades up and not you know having trouble in the school can you trust them with a car at 18. and then you say well you know you know I I said I'll get you a call but you know because of your conduct I I believe I got a hold back I'll wait till you get 21. are you with me so it's because of our conduct duck it's not that I'm gonna I'm not gonna get you to come but I'm gonna wait till you get a little bit more matured are you up man see because if I give it to you before you're even a Hound it then you might get out there and wreck you might put all kind of folks in the car and all kind of things it might cause you amen not to you know conduct yourself in a way you wouldn't have conducted yourself if you didn't have a car but you haven't proved to the parents that you can have it and uh God made promises to us that he wants to give to us but it's uh it's not that God won't give it to us he's willing to give us all the blessings that amen that comes with being children of Abraham and you know sometimes I've said you know it's not the because uh you know the Jews because they were Jews they thought because they were Jews they had uh certain Privileges and because of circumcision and everything they thought they were had certain privileges and you know some folks because we go to church because we say we're Christian because we say we believe God we think that we are privileged people amen and we all we're inheritance of the promises of God because we amen are Christians and because we believe him amen and then all the Bible tells us in Romans 2 it says he's not a Jew that is one hourly sometimes we think we're privileged because amen we believe that God sent a prophet and we uh you know we believe the message of the hour and so forth like they said we have Abraham for our father amen the Jews thought that Abraham Heisman and Jacob oh we got we can look back and we have those great uh Patriot odds that we can identify we can tell we're of their bloodline and you know sometimes we brag about what we have amen but he said not not not because you're a Christian because you say I believe in Jesus I've accepted him as my savior he said he's not a Jew that is one I will live but one Everly the circumcision is not of the flesh you know not uh you mean you may look like a Christian amen you may I think that you're a Christian you may you know look like amen everything is fine but he said our circumcision we can walk with our heads up and we can be proud that uh you know I am a really a Christian but the circumcision must be of the heart oh you want man it's got to be something that God has done with our hearts amen if we are not circumcising hard amen then I'll form of Christianity are saying that but amen well I I I'm of this persuasion I'm of that persuasive they were Pharisees inside your seeds and all of that and it was Abraham's seed Paul says amen I was Abraham seed and so forth I can look back in my bloodline you can check my DNA out I'm a child of Abraham and we can say I'm a Christian but what about our hearts and we worship God Amen he said he told a woman that the world neither this mountain is in Jerusalem but it's come a time when the true worship of God going to worship Him in spirit and in truth isn't that right so it's going to take more than just amen identified with a certain group of certain uh people it meant that we can shout and dance and amen praise the Lord because I'm this and I'm that amen it's going to take something Amen to change our inside it's the inside that needs changing amen because outside him and you may look holy amen you may act even in a certain way but is it or you're right in the inside of your heart right with God praise God because God is not going to judge your outside he gonna judge whether your heart is right and I'm gonna tell you something you can never buy what you can achieve or what you do and what you can accomplish that will make your heart right are you with me the Bible tells us salvation is of the Lord it's God that does that you cannot do it with human effort amen all our works and all that we try to do in the cloud that we've done amen it will never save us we'll see by faith through Grace and not of wax at least any man should most but it is the gift of God amen because God Amen has graced Upon Our Lives and that he came down and he died for our sin amen it's because of the blood and he said it's because of what he done for us that day on Calvary that makes a difference for us right now and I said Lord thank you I'm not trying to is it worth it sometimes we have to count up the cause God made us promises but sometimes I know sometimes the Infidel battle in his mind and sometimes the agnostic battles within themselves and sometimes there are people amen that's Christian but there are some that are slightly down amen is this Christianity is it real it's just God is it it does he does he really exist because in their kind of mind and in the intellectual way of thinking they would say God that will allow all of this to be taken place in the earth and yet we say he's a god of love yet we say is a God that cares and understands amen in my spirit amen last night is uh that's why I said I woke up this morning with my mind stand on Jesus so in my spirit I I felt pretty good because I was wrestling with the devil last night amen because all of those things you're confronted with and you have to wrestle amen so because the devil had amen he brings you up to points in your life and the places in your life that you wrestle and and as something rolls up in me amen and said God said don't you put that on me all the sickness and all the pains and all the death and everything that's going wrong don't put that on me amen well you said why did God allow sometimes we feel like it when God made the Angels say amen and he made man he said everything was good but what would it be like if God just made robots and just tuned him in and says okay you do this and that's all you can do would you rather be a robot where God says we just only good existing amen that's all you can do when I made you I made you amen for this and that's all you can do but will you like to have freedom of choice would you rather be a free moral agent where God gives you the opportunity to make your own decision when God made Lucifer he was not amen he was not the devil he was not amen evil God made him good but inside of Lucifer his desire amen that amen I'm not satisfied with being next to God I believe I can run this place I believe I can take over heaven there's nobody God let him do what he did called the third of the Angels why did God do that you talk to him when you get there but it was it was because he had a decision amen was it not uh amen I'm just going to worship God and I'ma stay in my position or whether or not he found that hey did I see God and I see all the angels I I believe I ought to have that and that's the way when the Garden of Eden God gave them a choice amen you got everything I give you dominion over everything the Earth and all the fishing to see the birds of the air over everything only one thing I want you to do don't touch the tree of knowledge and good and evil and don't eat of that but man chosen amen that but she wasn't even she just didn't do that because what Lucifer did in heaven he came down to the Earth and he got into serpent and he deceived the woman amen now why are you going to charge God for it when the Devil Himself deceived the woman but yet we put it on God why did God lie that he could have not not let the death but the woman had a choice Adam and Eve had a choice amen they could have said well no I'm gonna stick to what God Said I I don't care what the devil said I don't care how good the tree look I'm gonna stick to what God Said are you with me but they made a decision and he made a decision or I I think you know I think I just try it out and that's the way we are today he said behold I said before your life and death you choose and then when we make the wrong decisions we blame God for our decision the Bible said in Adam all died calls out on the job amen amen Adam saw what he did he could have made a decision I'm not going to do what you did but she did it too are you up man and because of what he did everybody that was born of a woman was born and said you mad at Adam you know some folks are better than Mom and Daddy for bringing them in there mama daddy you you you had no business bringing me here because it's an evil please are you with me so and that's the way the minds of folks are they complain about them being here instead of understanding while I'm here I have a decision to me I can choose a life or I can choose death I can choose good I could choose evil I have a decision to make what do I want do I want to choose good or do I want to choose evil and then if I choose evil the consequences of what my charges are it causes my life to be affected by my choice so I am alive if it's going in a bad way it may be what Mama did or what Daddy did or what Grandmama did because my life to be like it is because the sins up the parent can go into the third and fourth generation amen but the curse that's down can be broken by the blood of Jesus Christ if I make a decision I didn't have nothing to do with my birth amen I had no choice in being here but after I get here I have a decision that I can make whether or not I want to live for God amen am I going to continue I I see my birth and by Nature I have the nature of Adam and Eve it's in me to do wrong but that the last item which was Jesus Christ come to take away that sin for nation and said I'll give you a choice you can choose the last item and live or you can stay with the first nature which is the first Adam and you can die amen now you got to believe that God that made a promise to you he's not lying to you he if he made a promise to you you got to believe that God promises for you a yea and not name amen that he wants to bless you he wants to do you good and not evil amen he loves you enough to give his life for you and to die for your sin but somehow just like Eve the devil convinced her amen don't you do what God Said amen because it's a better way are you he's convincing folks today don't you do what God said because amen you can make your own mind of what you want doesn't make a difference whether it pleases God or not please yourself because there is no God there is if God was God why I said don't put this pain sickness and sorrow and all this uh evil and that don't put it on God you never knew amen what causes folks to be blind the disciples asked Jesus who the man was born blind he said who sinned this man or his parents it's neither one of them he said this was the one that I might be glorified are you with me and Jesus prayed and gave the man his sight isn't that right and see but they understood that I could be amen like I am because of some great Grandmama did a granddaddy did now go put it on God Amen God didn't do it are you with me I I that's what I want you to see God did not do all of this crime and all this wickedness and all this stuff that's going on in the world all this evil God didn't do it but there is a devil here there is a devil that seeks to steal the kill and destroy are you a man but Jesus said I come that they might have life and that they might have it what more abundantly are you with me so it's your decision this morning what do I want amen God made us promises somebody said exceeding great and precious promises are you up there but we amen because sometimes we believe that Satan told a lie isn't that right in the beginning he told a lie didn't he but the Bible said it's impossible for God to what to tell you a lie if God if it's impossible for God to tell you a lie amen Who you gonna believe we know Satan is a liar the Bible said he is a liar and the what in the father of lions and he was the one amen that started the line all together are you with me so if Satan is a liar and the father of Liars who are you gonna believe a God that it's impossible for him to lie are you gonna trust him for his promises that he made towards you praise God I said you know sometimes when we when we're going through we doubt whether or not dog gonna do what he said the children of Israel God made a promise said after 400 years I'm going to deliver you out of the land of Egypt isn't that right so uh uh God made that promise to them and they were Journey on to the promised land isn't that right but all through that Journey they began to disbelieve God and to doubt God and your Christian walk and all through your journey amen folks amen that God saved from their sins but God saved them from the Egyptians saved them from their sin but after that he had to destroy them because they did not they didn't believe amen when you stop trusting God for being who he is amen after all he does for you and I and after all he's done for you and I amen why should we doubt him in any aspect of our journey for he said I would never I'll never leave you neither will I oh but if you trust him amen amen if you trust him and do not doubt him he will surely bring you out praise God here take you in a place amen that you would not have to worry about anything praise God job had come to that place he said no you slay me yeah shall I trust you thank God I believe you're hearing how I go through some hard times but thank you Jesus I'm not gonna doubt you let me because I found out a long time ago that I know that my redeemer lives your garden look like it look at it but God said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you and second Peter's third chapter said the Lord is not slight concerning his promises as some men do counsel like this but he's what long suffering God suffer long for you and I he could come and say Amen Let the third world war and let man destroy himself but God is long-suffering he knew that one day you would hear the gospel trumpet amen and you were healed that there's a God that loves you that the god that cares about you the other Jesus that died for you amen and one day amen you come Amen in grips with Amen to the reality that God did God for me amen amen the god that gave his life for them ah Lord I believe Lord I believe in you and Lord I want to take you out your word amen I want to take you at your word I I tried life journey and I'll try to be successful all my own but now I recognize I need you Lord I want to trust God as my savior well yes and all I get and he said get understanding are you with me so in that the flight that we are on amen you and I must make amen decisions this morning will I Take God at his word will I believe him uh will I just keep on going down the pathway that I'm going do I want amen God way of Escape uh do I want God's lessons in my life and you know sometimes folks says well I'm already blessed but not amen praise God With the blessings that God wants to give you amen as far beyond your comprehension amen God got the lessons far beyond amen God is good to you amen but things can be better amen life can deem grinding in the grind but it could be falling on Grand praise God Amen you might say well uh God is doing this and that for me but I'm talking about hide your heart see it goes back to the heart don't you know that one's soul and God's sight is worth more than ten thousand worlds amen don't you know the value and I said back at the beginning uh what you got is it worth it see because I've seen people become millionaires multi-millionaires I sat down with Folk that looked like they had all achievements and all that I've seen them at the end of their Journey they spent all their life accumulating wealth and things but I've seen them at the end of their role you know what they say none of this mean nothing why because they couldn't take nothing with them and when they stand before God it wouldn't matter anyway but you work hard why sometimes to have something to leave your children some you want to be more comfortable in life and so forth all in this uh you're trying amen you want to bless yourself you're trying hard to bless your own self and when God has already provided for you are you with me he not only you know why you do all this for a corruptable crown but God has an Incorruptible crown for you all that you labor for amen the fire can burn it Ross indicated the house that you build you may spend a a part of a million a million dollars far but one day that house of a fire come it's gonna burn it if a hurricane comes it can blow it down the the money you got in the bank it can do like California it can crash amen the life that you're living is it worth it or would you rather have eternal life the joy that the world gives you so you satisfied amen how much you have to pay for that I said Jesus Paid It All I said Jesus already purchased you with his own blood he paid the debt for you all you got to do is believe all you got to do said God Amen I know it's impossible for you to tell a lie I want to serve you oh God I didn't get started this morning but as I was shocked last Sunday I'm short again oh you love me praise God God is good it's impossible for God to tell a lie God made a promise to you are you going to believe God for it's impossible for God to what to tell a lie isn't that right but you know the devil's been lying to you you lied to you you know a little fella can tell you how the good you look and how this and that lying to you go tell the other girl she looked better than you go tell her nothingman they'll lie to you won't you amen likewise the little girl say I love you I love you you're my only love she's lying all the guy in time tell another guy oh you know I love you you're my only love people alive isn't that right promise you amen I'm gonna be faithful to you next thing you know they ain't faithful they met somebody jumping out the window running out the back door are you up there but they may promises to you I'm gonna be faithful to you I care about you I love you baby darling you know and you believe that isn't that right folks that lie to you remember the Bible said God who is impossible for God to us Lord to you why don't you believe him it's so easy to believe the devil isn't it right it's Endeavor amen I said oh you know you you don't realize that it's a spiritual thing amen that you confronted with it's real but you know you know I I I won't be saved after a while you know well are you why it's gonna be after a while when God that's something better for you now why you gonna wait there after a while amen somebody want to give you a 10 million dollars you say yeah I get it after a while it all right maybe next year next year somebody I'm giving it to you now next year not promised to you man I ain't been here next year how can you spend it next year when I'm giving it to you now God gives you eternal life right now well you're going to tell God wait I can have eternal life right now Jesus is already personally already said in the blood already made a way for you and provision so I'm coming back for you I I go to prepare a place for you but where I am he made a promise that I'm coming back second Peter said the elements the Earth is going to catch a fire the elements gonna make with affirmative he said nevertheless we're called into his promise look for a new Heaven and a new way in dwell his righteousness God promised he coming back for you but uh I'd rather have this right here right now amen if he come back can you know come back from somebody else I I don't want to go because I'm satisfied with what I got and if he come back for them let them go but I'd rather trust what I got right now than to trust what God has in store for them that trust him see people make up their mind and they don't know what they're doing right now because the devil could blind you so bad that he can keep
