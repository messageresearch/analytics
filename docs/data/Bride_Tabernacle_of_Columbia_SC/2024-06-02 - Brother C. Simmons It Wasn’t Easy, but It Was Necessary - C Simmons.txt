amen amen if you have your Bibles today we turn to First Kings chapter 17 how many glad to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen First Kings 17 and we'll start at the 7th verse when you got it say amen amen and it reads and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up and because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zarapa which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he rose so he arose and went to zarapa and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there a gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water and a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a Morse a a morsel of bread in thine hand and she said and she said as the Lord Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me therefore a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son son for he said for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel the bearer of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth amen God bless the reading of this word you may be seated amen for this morning I had a little topic that I entitled it wasn't easy but it was necessary it wasn't easy but it was necessary the story came to my mind as I Was preparing and studying I thought about this widow woman that you and I thought about something that I said you know she came to her last she came to her last before God showed up on the scene she came to her last until before God showed up on the scene and I entitled I said it wasn't easy but it was necessary so many of times you may come to a place or may come to a space that it won't be easy but God will take you through the situation or the test and the trial to show you that when you come to the other side it was necessary when you done gone through it and maybe you look back and you said you know what it wasn't easy but it was necessary it was necessary for my growth it was necessary for me to come back and say Lord I Thank you for what you brought me through I thank you for how you delivered me and how you taking me through these things and I learned that you know what sometimes it's not easy but it's necessary and so I was thinking about it and she might have thought you know what this Prophet is asking me a lot isn't he I don't even know who the stranger is cuz she didn't she didn't even know who the stranger was at the time but she felt led that you know what this this is something extraordinary cuz everybody understands that at this time nobody had food nobody had water these were things that they were in a famine at this time so when someone comes to ask you for something it has to be something deep down in the inside that opens up to you and say you know what I'm going to give it's something deep down in the inside that says you know what I this is who I am she showed who her character was by offering even in her time of struggle she offered up to the man of God and she said here I don't have but a little and but the little that I have I'm going to give to you see it wasn't easy but it was necessary sometimes God puts stories there so you can see character sometimes he put a story there so that you can understand that what is required of you that that sometimes you're going to run into those moments that you don't understand why you're going to run into those moments that you don't understand what's going on you're going to run into those moments that you don't understand how am I going to make it but it ain't going to be easy but it's necessary it's not going to be easy but it's something that you got to go through in order for you to grow am something that you got to go through in order for you to become stronger it's something that you got to go through in order for you to get to where God wants you to be he wouldn't have given it to you if he wasn't going to give you a way to escape it he wouldn't have given it to you if it wasn't a reason for you to go through it even though some things you go through and he said you reap what you s because and you go through these tests and trials and it might have been something that happened but you know what he also said my steps are ordered by the Lord L and before you even were here he knew where you were going to go he knew what you were going to do he knew how you was going to act and react he he knew all these things and yet he still allowed you to go through what you go through and yet he still allowed you he said it it's not going to be easy but it's necessary it's necessary for you to go through this because I need you to learn something I need you to grow through something I need you not to stay babies one day but to grow up and be a man to be a woman to be someone that I can trust you with more than what what you have now see it might not be easy but it's worth it it's necessary for you to go through these things and I started to think about in the Bible there were many example I said I thought about an exodus chap 12 when Moses they had gone through and the children of Israel were in captivity they were in Egypt and they were held captive for over 400 years and while they were in Egypt and they was and they was going through the and trials it wasn't easy but it was necessary because they had done some things and God said this is the path that you got to go this is the path that you got to go but he said after 400 years I'm going to deliver you so they knew that promise was given to him and it was going to happen they didn't know how it was going to happen and they might have thought it was going to happen one way even Moses might have thought it was going to happen one way but God had a whole another way that it was going to happen it wasn't going to be the easy road that Moses just walk in there and say y'all can go free amen there was tests and trials that Moses had to go through to the point that Moses said Lord I I don't have nothing to the point that he got down so low that Lord don't why you going to send me the Lord had to come and supernaturally visit him in that burning bush and speak to him and say you know what you my servant you was always my servant but now it's time for you to do the work you see it wasn't easy for Moses to go through all that but it was necessary Moses wouldn't have learn that how he had to depend on God if he would have never gone through those situations he wouldn't have learned how to lean on him and listen to him and expect him to move in Supernatural ways if he wouldn't have gone through that experience if he hadn't killed that Egyptian if he hadn't run to the desert if he hadn't met his wife and went through those test and trials Moses would not have learned that it wasn't easy but it was necessary but when Moses got done and he came to and the Lord started doing plagues on these Egyptians as he was delivering the children of Israel and each one you wonder why they got worse they got worse and each one took a little bit more from those Egyptians and but the final plague was what we call the Passover and when you was in the Passover the Lord made a declaration he said all he was going to kill all the firstborns unless you had blood on the doorpost unless you had blood on your lentil he was going to kill all those first mornings and I want to say it wasn't easy but it was necessary see you don't know what God had to do in order for you to get to where you need to get to you don't know what God had to put you through in order for you to get to where you need to get to said it was necessary for those Egyptian Sons to be killed you would say why would why would that be necessary maybe that was the only way they was going to get delivered out see it wasn't easy but but it was necessary God had a way of doing a thing that nobody could see but he also was showing his children if you listen to what I say I will provide if you listen to what I say I will keep you saved if you listen to what I say I will cover you and make sure that you are under this blood and that you are covered and that God is going to take care of you no matter what see he said that you're my children and I ain't lost one I haven't lost one that you that are my seed and so it was necessary for them to go through that amen so when they got to the Wilderness they could understand he's still the same God he's still the same God that kept our children saved he's still the same God that parted the Red Sea see it wasn't easy but it was necessary they might have was complaining when they got to that Red Sea and didn't see a way through they might have was complaining and didn't understand it but see it was necessary it was something to prove that you know I'm still God Amen if you forgot about me from Egypt and delivering me I want to prove to you that I'm still the same God if you forgot about me when when you get on to the other side of this I'm going to show you that I'm going to destroy all your enemies cuz I'm still the same God and when you get down there and you complaining about me and food I'm going to send something for you because I'm still the same God see it may not be easy but it's necessary say God always bring you through if you trust him if you believe in them and you put your faith in them and don't doubt them if he said in his word he was going to do something he'll do it say it may not be easy but it's necessary I said Esther she got down to a point where she it wasn't going to be easy for her the decision that she made that she was going to make she didn't know the outcome when she walked into that King's room she didn't know the outcome cuz the decree was that if he didn't lift that Selter he she was gone but she knew it was necessary for her to do that in order for her to save her people and Mori told her maybe you was put in this place for such a time as this see it wasn't easy but it was necessary for her to go through that door and she said but but the the key to me that got me when I was thinking about it and I said when you read the story you realize that before she did it she prayed amen it wasn't that she just walked through the door some type of way and say just going she got down and not only did she pray she said I want all y'all that are here to fast and pray and all my maidens that maybe the saved and unsaved she had them fasting and praying because she knew that she needed someone to show up on the scene that was greater than her she needed someone to move in her midst that was greater than her see it might have not been easy but it was necessary see that was the way for God to provide a way of Escape she had to go through that door she had to do what was required of her because maybe she was built for such a time as this and I said I thought about it I wrote something down I said sometimes you have to have the right attitude during your test and trials says sometimes you have to have the right attitude during your test and trials say sometimes you may get to a place and you know what the major mistake that you may make is how you respond it's not what you did it's not what you said it was how you responded and said sometime God got to take you sometime multiple times even in my life he'll take you back through a similar situation until you learn you know what I got to respond different you know what I got to change the way that I'm looking at this situation I got to change the way that I'm going through this because if I don't I'm just going to repeat it if I don't I'm just going to go through it again and said God has a way of allowing you to learn allowing you to you know what if you my child I'm going to make sure that you learn this lesson right I'm going to make sure that you get this lesson no matter how long it takes but sometimes you canot take the mercies of God and the grace of God for granted cuz God will take you through test but sometimes you take yourself through some things sometimes you take yourself through some things that you didn't have to go through but don't take it for granted and I I said and I thought about the story in in Matthew chapter CH 9 where Jesus he healed the ruler's daughter but on the way to the ruler's daughter there was a certain young lady that had to get to Jesus because she had a sickness in her body and she realized that Lord I want to make it to you because I need something from you she didn't care who was around she didn't care what was going on see it wasn't easy for her but it was necessary for her to get to Jesus it was necessary because she knew that if she didn't get to him she wasn't going to make it see it might not have been easy but it was necessary so she got she got to the point that even though it was hundreds and maybe many people around Jesus she might have had to scratch and crawl and bump her way through but she got to him and when she got to him she touched them and her touch was different all the people that might have been touching Jesus they might Jesus didn't feel anything but when she touched them something happened amen and sometimes you got to get to that point that even if it ain't easy it's necessary for me to get to Jesus it's necessary for me to get so closed and down and so desperate that Lord I need you to show up on my behalf said you might not know about other people but if when you get a need so serious you find a way to get to them you might you might have not looked at them yesterday today but you know that Lord I need you today I need need you in this moment I need you right now and I need you to do something for me now there's requirements that if you want them to do it and you want him to do it right he said come to me and lay lay down all your burdens and he'll give you rest that's all you got to do all he wants is the life that you can give to him that's all he wants but it might not be easy but it's necessary said everybody you come to it sometimes and I've been to many of them many funerals and some times and a lot of people they want to put you in a place here or there but I said the way that you can make sure that you that you go there is follow exactly what he asked you to do you don't have to worry about it we don't have to worry about it nobody has to worry about it if you do what his word say do all you got to do is repent and come to him and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what he requires of you but you come to it and it might not be easy but it's necessary so a Christian Life might not be easy but it's necessary it's necessary because that's what God is requiring of you I said sometimes you have to give up some things in life and it's not going to be easy but it's necessary sometimes God has to take you through your most difficult trials to give you your greatest blessing see that trial is not going to be easy but it's necessary in order for you to see the greatness of God it's necessary for you to understand what God is trying to do in your life and I said when Jesus got to the Garden of Gethsemane he he got to a point where he was praying and nobody was praying with him but while he was going through it he knew what was to come to pass for him and while he was going through it he realized that it might not be easy but it was necessary until he pinned the words and he said thy will be done amen he realized it was nothing that was important about him anymore the reason that he was going through it was for me I said the reason that it was he was doing it was because of you he knew that the only way that you can make it to heaven was for him to die on that cross the only way for you to make it into heaven was him to shed his blood for you the only way for him to make it in for you to make it in was for him to take those stripes to take those beatings to take those whippings on his back and to and to go there and to lay down his life for you and I he said I want to read something he said in in this time when Jesus was going see he said that when he was on his way there he said he got his eyes set to Calvary he's going right straight to Jerusalem to be offered for a sacrifice when he went to that cross he was a sacrifice for you and I and said the weight of every sin that was ever committed on the earth or would ever be committed was rested upon his precious shoulders you think about that all the things that you have done that wasn't right and then think about everyone else that had ever committed a sin or was ever going to commit a sin was on his shoulders just think of that burden if you can even think about some sometimes the devil would like to remind you of things that you have done and the burden that that is placed on your life just imagine everyone and he took all of that and said he was a big man but when people say bad things about you if you can just go on and forget it that shows that you're a big man said little man he said when people say bad things about you if you can just go on and forget it that shows that you're a big man he said little man can't temple with it he was too big to listen to criticism so many of times you may go through it and say you know what this ain't necessary for me I'm I don't want to hear this but if you don't hear it you'll never understand or grow through it because you'll always avoid it sometimes you get the things and somebody may say something the first thing you do you walk out the room I've done it because you don't want to hear it but sometimes that's the that's the time that you got to go through that to grow you got to go through that you got to understand it and sometimes if you listen you might hear a little bit of Truth in it it may not be you might not like how it was given to you but it might be the truth and if you listen to it you can might can grow from it see it might not be easy but it's necessary and the reason why you keep hearing it is because you ain't changing the reason why you keep hearing it and going through it is because nothing is changing and it ain't till they see some change that you won't hear it no more it's a easy fix but sometimes we don't see it that way because we're in the process of going through it but it won't be easy but it's necessary it's necessary for your growth and said see he was too big to listen to their criticism he had one thing to do and that was his father's will and sometimes we we don't spend enough time lord what do you want me to do amen getting down and searching it and say Lord what would you have me to do I was just talking to someone the other day and he was like and he was telling me he was like you know he was working and doing some things and goes to a different church and whatnot and he said you know I was in a position he said how do you know how do you know if someone else is even able to handle this position if you always sitting in it that's right right how how do you know if if you're stunting if you're not stunting someone's growth if you won't allow God to move you that's right see it's something to be in the right position where God has you if you in that position you can grow but you see even if you in the right position it may not be easy but it's necessary say God has a way of taking everything that you may go through and allowing you to learn from it and allowing you to grow from it and allowing him to build something in you that's greater than anything you can ever have and that's your character when you get done that's the only thing when you come here and that body is lifeless that's the only thing that people will speak of they will speak of your character amen and and some people you know some people they you just shake your head and some people you it's a easy thing to do because of the character of the person it's an easy thing to go because of the character of the person it said what are you doing are you following his will for your life see it may not be easy because sometime you got to let go of some things sometimes you got to lay aside some things sometimes you got to separate from some people sometimes you got to step away from some family and sometimes you got to remove yourself even in this day and age from the things that you may see from the things that you may watch from the things that that you may be surrounded with and now now days it don't even have to be in person nowaday it's so easy to consume so much but sometimes you got to set it down and get with God you got to set it down and say Lord what would you have me to do Lord what would you have me to go through and said see God he had to die for those men he had to die for him so he kept up his face set towards Calvary on this way and said you can imagine the strain that was on on Jesus the seeing Yonder of Gethsemane the agonies of galtha and the forsaking of God just imagine as he's walking up there the Earth is turning black his shoulders rubbing and his face bleeding from his wrongs and all was him even to his to his father father I if it be possible that this cup be removed see he got to the point that he knew it wasn't easy cuz he said if it was possible let this cup be removed but he realized it was necessary for him to carry that cup it was necessary for him to go to Calvary it was necessary for him to go to galtha and to die that day it was necessary for that blood to be shed because as he showed it in in Moses he was shown as a type in a shadow to show that as he cover covered them under the blood he was going to cover us under the blood even even though I wasn't here even though I might not have been thought of he was showing that you know what he that's my seed and I want him to make it so he took on all these burdens he took on all this pain he took on all this Agony because he wanted each and every one of us to make it and he GI and he gives us a choice he gives us a choice and and and he realized that even though while he was going through this that it wasn't easy but it was necessary but he realized he had to fulfill the scriptures that was written about him he had to take those stripes because in Isaiah 6 in Isaiah 53 it says that he was by his stripes we were healed see those stripes wasn't easy but it was necessary if he wouldn't have took those stripes I wouldn't had my healing if he wouldn't have died for me I wouldn't had salvation if he wouldn't if he wouldn't rose again there wouldn't be no way for me to make it up there but see he did it because it wasn't easy but it was necessary see it was necessary for him to do those things to prove to you and I that there's a way of Escape there's a way that you can get out of all the things that you going through all you got to do is come to him all you got to do is lay down your burdens and come to him and slow say Lord I want your rest Lord I want you to give me a place that I can rest and the many things that you go through the one thing that people may be searching for is peace [Applause] each and every person I don't care how much you may say that you have everyone wants to find that special place amen people search all over the world search all over the place if you got enough money you create your Oasis so that you can stay there and be there all alone you know to have your peace but there's no peace that is here except in Christ Jesus there's no peace that you can find like the like the Lord Jesus and when you have that peace he gives you that peace in the inside that no matter what you may be going through no matter what you may may be going on you can have that peace you can turn to him and you can say Lord I need more and he can give you more Lord I need more rest and he can give you that he can give you that joy that comes from the inside that you don't even understand but it's there and it's bubbling up inside of you he can give you the Holy Ghost and Jeremiah said it's like fire shut up in my bones said sometimes it comes out and and it ex and you can see it and said that it God can give you all these things all you got to do is come to them cuz even though it might not be easy to come to them it will get easier but your trials may change your trials May that don't mean you won't have trials that don't mean you won't have test and tribulation that even though it's not easy it's necessary God has a way of making a way of Escape that you may not even understand sometimes he got to take you around the corner down the bin and up the road for you to understand what you just went through and you and you look back and all you can say is thank you Jesus thank you Jesus for what even though it wasn't easy it was necessary even though I didn't understand it it was necessary even though I might not can or others around me didn't understand it it was necessary cuz all that I can do is come back and give you glory and give you honor and give you praise for what you've done for me I can always come back and say Lord I Thank You For What the way that you provided for me so even though it wasn't necessary even though it wasn't easy it was necessary and now I can say it was worth it I can say it was worth it because you brought me through I can say it was worth it because of the work that you can done I can testify that God you are a Healer because it was wasn't easy but it was necessary sometimes it was a scripture in the Bible that showed that this man he was sick and he was blind in the eyes and they was asking him was it for his parents' sin or was it for something that he had done and he said it was neither he said I just wanted to keep this to be a testimony of the glory of God and the paraphrase and that's what he did it sometime and sometimes you may not understand it but it may be a testimony to someone that's around you it may be a testimony that you can prove that God is still God said he kept doing things for the israelit to the point when they came to the to Jordan River they came in flood time see it wasn't easy but it was necessary cuz God wanted to remind them that I'm still the same God if I parted the Red Sea what do you think I'm going to do now and they might not it might have been a new generation that hadn't seen it might have been a new different people that hadn't seen what God had done they' only heard stories and sometime God all you to go through things to show it to you and if you ask him Lord I want to see you he'll show it to you Lord I want to see you work in my life he'll show it to you and don't and I and I was thinking about in a minister something I said and in those moments you can't forget to tell God thank you amen cuz he'll do something and you might have asked him for and sometimes we get forgetful sometimes but when you look back over you can't forget to tell God thank you I said that even though it it might not be easy it's necessary it's necessary for you to go through those things because if you don't go through them you won't grow if you don't go through them he won't you won't ever see the handiwork of God you won't see what God can do so he takes you through and sometimes he takes you through multiple things at once he'll let it be a almost a job where you feel like this is wrong and that is wrong and this is wrong and that is wrong WR and it's not going to be easy but it's necessary cuz when you come through it is you have a different type of Praise You have a different type of joy you have a different type of understanding of how good God is you have a different type of understanding of how wonderful God is and when you think about it you can say Lord I Thank You Lord I Thank You Lord I Thank You Lord I Thank you and that's all sometimes you can say is Lord I Thank you Lord I Thank you said sometimes that's all you get down on your knees and you pray and you spend a half an hour an hour just thanking the lord just for what he's done and it might not have been a long time because you you might have just got started on what he's done this week amen you ain't looked back five or 10 years cuz that's how good God is and that's how much he can do and he does for you on a daily basis when you think about just thinking about how he woke you up this morning and you might not even woke up on the time that you wanted to but you woke up you was able to walk around you was able to get dressed you was able to use your limbs you was able to talk to speak to listen to hear and then when you think about all those small things you start thanking God so much more so much more Lord I have a car to drive Lord I got money in the bank I might have a home to live in a roof over my head and once you keep going you said Lord I Thank you see it might not be easy all the time but it's necessary it's necessary for me to go through those tests and trials cuz at the end of them he he promised that he was going to bless you see it's necessary you would never know the blessings of God if you don't go through nothing and said sometimes you trying to escape a trial that God is sending you through you're trying to escape something that God has a way to send you through it and you wondering why you keep coming back to the same point because it's necessary it's necessary for you to go through it and you will only understand it like the ssal says by and by when the morning comes so all the saints are gathered said you see that God has to take you through it for you to understand it sometimes you asking why and God just said just trust me that's it I I don't have to explain nothing to you I just want you to trust me because it might not be easy but it's necessary it's necessary for you to go through this it's necessary for you to climb this hill and go over this mountain to understand when you get up there you can look back said you know that was rough and that was treacherous but the more that I go up the higher I go the more I realize that Lord I know that you are real I know that you are God for sure cuz if it wasn't for you I wouldn't be where I am if it wasn't for you I wouldn't even climb this far so if you brought me this far you can continue to take me if you brought me this far I can continue to trust you if you brought me this far I can continue to thank you for what you're going to do and you might have only done so much but Lord if you don't do nothing else for me I still have enough praise and thanks for what you've done thus far for what you've done and the wayte that you made say even though Lord it might not be easy it's necessary it's necessary for my growth it's necessary for God for God to take me through these things and there's examples All Through the Bible that you can read what God took people through certain things and many of times he always showed up at the last moment he didn't show up when when when maybe sometimes when they called them I had another story where the woman where the Widow and and Elijah and she had a son she had been praying for a son and the son finally got there and the Lord blessed her with her son and then one day the son fell sick and he died and she got on she got on on an animal and she went to the to the to the man of God and she didn't ask him for this or that he asked her one thing she and he asked her basically how is the everything going and she said it is well it was the attitude that she had in that moment that changed her situation she knew where to go and she knew how to get there but she said but when they asked how everything was going she said it is well said it wasn't easy but it was necessary see when she got got there she needed something and the Lord he brought the prophet of God back and allowed him and the Lord blessed the son and Rose him up it was the very thing that she had prayed for but she didn't realize that it wasn't going to be easy but it was necessary and sometimes we we expect God to do things one way but he has a way of doing it all by himself cuz sometimes even though we may have a path or a thought of something that we want to do God has a way of shi it he has a way of showing it to you and say that you know what this is the path that you actually need to take even though it might not be easy or what you want is necessary so God has a way of doing these things because he wants to prove to you that I'm still God and I change not amen let us all vow Lord Jesus we thank you for this day we thank you for allowing us to be in your house one more Time Lord we ask that you that Lord we know that sometimes you take us through but Lord we ask that you give us the strength Lord to trust you more you give us the strength Lord to to depend on you more and to lean on you and Lord through it all Lord we may say that it's not easy but it's necessary not only is it
