[36:35] may of 2020.
[36:38] i got saved in june i got saved in june
[36:41] of 2020. um
[36:43] kind of during the pandemic
[36:46] um
[36:48] well first my story i gotta say when i
[36:49] was six years old um
[36:51] my grandmother said i got saved at six
[36:53] years old um and from there you know god
[36:56] started using me um
[36:58] you know i was executing prophesying
[37:00] words and they would come forth
[37:02] and um immediately the enemy started
[37:04] coming in my life at about i would say
[37:06] 13. um i met the wrong crowd started
[37:09] drinking
[37:10] you know um smoking
[37:12] doing drugs um hanging with the wrong
[37:14] people
[37:16] and um
[37:17] i just remember at 19 years old like i
[37:19] completely turned away from god you know
[37:20] god was always in my heart but it got to
[37:22] the point where i just completely forgot
[37:25] everything i was taught you know um just
[37:27] totally forgot about him and um
[37:30] from 19 to i would say about 28 i was on
[37:34] cocaine um addicted to alcohol
[37:38] um just you know in fornication just
[37:40] just doing anything you can imagine in a
[37:43] gang selling drugs doing drugs
[37:45] um
[37:47] and um i just remember one night i got
[37:49] drunk and i did some uh i did some
[37:50] cocaine
[37:52] and
[37:53] i almost i would say it was almost like
[37:55] an overdose but you know as it was
[37:56] happening i remember the ambulance came
[37:58] and looked at my face and he said he
[37:59] said where are you on and i just kept
[38:01] remember thinking that i'm about to die
[38:03] so immediately i started my heart
[38:04] repenting asking god to forgive me for
[38:07] you know um anything i could think about
[38:08] and that and that reminded me that that
[38:10] god was always in my heart still as i
[38:12] was doing what i was doing for me to
[38:13] immediately call on him during the
[38:14] situation
[38:16] um so after the situation ended um came
[38:19] home from the hospital my grandma called
[38:20] me and she said um the lord what you say
[38:23] so um y'all repeated the prayer
[38:26] you know uh with the prayers she had me
[38:27] repeat i repeat it you know didn't mean
[38:29] it from my heart still went back to the
[38:31] life i was living
[38:33] and um
[38:34] i just remember one night i kind of woke
[38:35] up on the couch at like three o'clock in
[38:37] the morning and it's like i woke up
[38:38] sober i went to bed drunk and high woke
[38:40] up sober and i just remember like
[38:43] my life flashed in front of my eyes i
[38:45] seen from the time i was a little boy
[38:47] until up until um the night i was on the
[38:49] couch and i just something snapped in my
[38:51] head and i realized that you know
[38:53] with how i was living it wasn't me
[38:56] i called my sister and i told her i said
[38:57] whatever prayer i repeated when i was
[38:59] young um i said send me that prayer i
[39:01] said you know i need to get saved i said
[39:03] you know the way i'm living is not me
[39:05] so i remember she sent it to me and i
[39:07] went upstairs in the bathroom not and i
[39:09] just started crying i sat in the tub and
[39:11] i just started crying crying calling up
[39:13] to god i said you know what's the
[39:14] purpose of all this i said if i'm going
[39:16] to be still addicted to cigarettes bound
[39:18] by alcohol um you know

[39:23] and selling drugs i said what's the
[39:24] point of you like what's the point of
[39:25] you you know me being saved
[39:27] i said if you're not going to take all
[39:28] this away from me i don't want nothing
[39:30] to do with you so um i said what i said
[39:32] to him i repeated the prayer and um i
[39:34] walked out the bathroom and i remember i
[39:36] went to sleep and i woke up the next
[39:37] morning and it was like um the first
[39:40] thing i usually wake up i ran that time
[39:41] the first thing i did when i woke up
[39:42] with smoked a cigarette i had a shot of
[39:45] any kind of alcohol that i had
[39:47] you know i went to go try to smoke a
[39:49] cigarette and it's like the taste was
[39:50] completely gone on my mouth like i i
[39:52] didn't even want it the desire for it
[39:54] was gone i went in the kitchen and tried
[39:55] to pour a shot and i just looked and i
[39:58] was like
[39:58] and i put the bottle down i just walked
[40:00] outside and i i tried to um i tried to

[47:07] first corinthians chapter 4 verse 14.
[47:12] and
[47:16] jesus follows
[47:20] i write not these things
[47:22] to shame you
[47:24] but in my beloved sons i warn you
[47:27] not now
[47:28] you know
[47:29] this book of corinthians is referred to
[47:31] as
[47:32] a book of correction
[47:34] there's a lot of things that were
[47:36] not in the best let's say the right
[47:38] order in the corinthians church and so
[47:39] paul was
[47:40] writing to them corrected him on a lot
[47:42] of things and so when paul says i'm not
[47:43] writing these things to shame you he's
[47:45] he's writing correction but he's writing
[47:47] correction out of love i want you to
[47:49] understand where he's coming from
[47:51] he says but i write unto you as my
[47:53] beloved sons i warn you
[47:55] for though ye may have ten thousand
[47:57] instructors in christ
[48:00] yet have ye not many fathers
[48:02] for in christ jesus i have begotten you
[48:05] through the gospel
[48:06] wherefore i beseech you
[48:08] be followers
[48:10] of me
[48:11] bower heads
[48:12] dear heavenly father lord i want to give
[48:14] you thanks for your grace thank you for
[48:15] your word
[48:16] thank you for your holy spirit lord may
[48:18] your spirit have premised tonight
[48:21] take your word make it real to every one
[48:22] of our hearts we asked in jesus christ's
[48:24] name
[48:25] amen
[48:33] and i'm gonna amen a title for my
[48:35] thought tonight
[48:37] my title is leadership
[48:39] leadership
[48:40] and for a subtitle
[48:43] correctly dedicated to the word of god
[48:47] correctly dedicated to the word of god
[48:50] you know many people are dedicated to a
[48:52] lot of things in life
[48:54] some are dedicated to job careers
[48:57] some are dedicated to family that's very
[48:58] noble
[49:00] some may even be dedicated to the church
[49:02] there's a lot of things a person can be
[49:04] dedicated to but
[49:06] not always the the right dedication
[49:10] we find out paul was a very dedicated
[49:11] man once paul was dedicated to the
[49:13] pharisees way of doing things and he was
[49:16] so much dedicated to it that he was
[49:17] actually persecuting the church of god
[49:20] for preaching jesus christ
[49:22] but paul came to a spot that we
[49:24] recognize that though he was dedicated
[49:26] he found out he wasn't dedicated in the
[49:27] right
[49:28] way we found out from the scriptures
[49:30] that there was a prophet by the name of
[49:32] isaiah one time
[49:34] isaiah was prophet was a prophet and he
[49:36] lived at the same time as king josiah
[49:39] and we found out the bible said in the
[49:40] day that king azia died isaiah said i
[49:43] found the lord
[49:44] he was a very dedicated young prophet he
[49:46] was dedicated to the king he was
[49:47] dedicated to the king's kingdom
[49:49] but when naziah died he realized that
[49:51] there was a greater dedication than king
[49:53] uzziah or you follow me and so even
[49:55] though he was dedicated to a good thing
[49:56] he found out there was a better thing to
[49:58] be dedicated to not a natural king but a
[50:00] king of kings jesus christ so you follow
[50:02] me
[50:03] so dedication is a good thing but to be
[50:05] correctly dedicated listen
[50:07] to be correctly dedicated is much better
[50:10] and when it comes to the word in order
[50:12] to be correctly dedicated
[50:14] there's only one way that can come about
[50:16] that's by leadership
[50:18] it's going to take leadership
[50:21] why do we need leadership why is
[50:22] leadership so important
[50:25] leadership is necessary to provide
[50:26] guidance
[50:28] guidance is required when you're trying
[50:30] to reach a specific goal or a specific
[50:32] objective
[50:34] and it's especially necessary when you
[50:36] got more than one person involved
[50:39] whenever you got a group of people
[50:40] you're going to need leadership in order
[50:42] to bring a group of people to a unified
[50:44] mind to a unified vision to a unified
[50:46] purpose that just don't come by osmosis
[50:48] and people conversating with each other
[50:49] it's going to take a vision to bring
[50:51] those people together that takes
[50:52] leadership
[50:54] and it's needed to maintain unity and
[50:56] focus whenever there's a vision
[50:58] you know i made a comment this is my
[51:00] first time in this new church
[51:02] you know the last time i think i was
[51:03] down this way was brother
[51:05] chisholm's funeral that's been a little
[51:06] while back and the funeral is held in
[51:09] the other building but this building was
[51:10] already under construction and only
[51:11] thing they had in here was sheetrock and
[51:13] that's how far back that was and i
[51:15] remember coming through and brother
[51:16] simmons gave me a little quick tour and
[51:18] i saw what was going up but but but in
[51:20] order to to build this church
[51:24] somebody had to have a vision
[51:26] and i remember when i was talking to
[51:27] brother simmons this was
[51:29] probably even four or five years prior
[51:30] to that we had come down to print
[51:32] minister one service and we were sitting
[51:34] back in his pastor's study and he pulled
[51:36] out some plans and he was telling me
[51:38] brother mike he said i'm trying to get
[51:39] this church built and i've i've kind of
[51:41] got some things i need to get done i'm
[51:42] trying to find me an architect to help
[51:43] me take these plans and perfect them and
[51:45] take them to the next level so i can go
[51:47] on and get this thing contracted and
[51:48] when he began to show the plans i'll be
[51:50] honest i didn't know what i was looking
[51:51] at
[51:52] but but but whoever drafted those plans
[51:55] listen now
[51:56] had a vision
[51:58] they saw this building before the
[52:00] building was ever built
[52:02] they knew where the wires would be
[52:04] they knew what the lights would be they
[52:05] knew the doors would be are you
[52:07] following me they knew how the platform
[52:08] would be they knew all about this
[52:10] building somebody had drove the whole
[52:12] thing out completely before they was
[52:14] ever the first priest of
[52:17] mortar brought onto this property before
[52:18] it was the first piece of wood brothers
[52:20] probably somebody had to see that
[52:23] and then that vision was then
[52:24] communicated and turned over to the
[52:26] hands of somebody it was turned to the
[52:28] hands of your pastor
[52:30] and your pastor had this vision it was
[52:31] on a piece of paper but then now get
[52:33] this he had to rally the people around
[52:35] him to agree with his vision
[52:38] he said this is what i wanted to
[52:39] accomplish this is what i want to build
[52:41] and in order for him to do it he
[52:42] couldn't do it by himself it was going
[52:43] to take a group of people to bring that
[52:44] vision to pass so as a leader guess what
[52:47] he had to be anointed to bring a people
[52:49] together to say you know what i want to
[52:50] be a part of this vision and then they
[52:52] cooperated and participated in what they
[52:54] contributed time they contributed
[52:56] resources all these things would happen
[52:58] to what to bring to pass a vision
[53:00] or you follow me but in order to happen
[53:03] one person couldn't say i want to see
[53:04] the building facing this way one
[53:06] couldn't say i want to see it facing
[53:07] that way one couldn't say i want one
[53:09] door on the back one can say i want
[53:10] somebody had to have a vision and then
[53:12] the vision had to be presented and then
[53:14] somebody had to say i agree with that
[53:16] vision and they were willing to walk
[53:17] according to what was already laid out
[53:19] in that plan
[53:20] that was the only way this building was
[53:22] going to come about somebody had to buy
[53:24] into the vision then everybody had to
[53:26] walk in one accord and say i agree with
[53:28] that vision or you follow me
[53:30] that takes leadership
[53:32] that takes leadership
[53:33] and so we want to talk about leadership
[53:36] leadership is needed to keep to present
[53:38] a vision and then to keep that vision on
[53:40] track that takes leadership it takes
[53:42] somebody that has the ability to lead
[53:44] and somebody that's willing to stand
[53:46] behind leadership and say i'm willing to
[53:48] be a follower or you follow me
[53:50] so when paul said follow me paul wasn't
[53:52] trying to build a church for himself
[53:55] paul wasn't trying to build a name for
[53:56] himself paul was actually trying to say
[53:58] i've been commissioned as a leader in
[54:00] this generation and in order for me to
[54:02] bring about the vision that god has
[54:04] given me i'm going to need somebody to
[54:06] follow me to bring this vision to pass
[54:08] are you following me so paul wasn't
[54:10] saying follow the flesh paul was saying
[54:12] i've got a vision i want you to buy into
[54:14] this vision and follow me
[54:16] i want you to watch this he wasn't
[54:18] trying to get you to follow him watch
[54:19] what he says in the same book the first
[54:21] corinthians in chapter 11 verse 1. paul
[54:24] says he repeats this same statement
[54:26] again
[54:26] paul says be followers of me but this
[54:29] time he kind of clarifies it a little
[54:31] bit he said be followers of me as i am
[54:34] of christ what was he saying he had met
[54:36] that pill of fire and that pillow fired
[54:38] tow paul paul there's a specific thing i
[54:41] want to accomplish in your generation
[54:43] and i'm sending you as a man to
[54:45] accomplish that thing that i want to
[54:47] bring to pass so paul wasn't coming out
[54:49] preaching a message for him his own self
[54:51] he had been given a vision by almighty
[54:53] god and god said paul this is my vision
[54:55] for that generation and paul was looking
[54:57] for a people who was willing to follow
[54:59] that vision
[55:01] and paul said if you believe god is sin
[55:03] to me if you believe i've been anointed
[55:04] for this that bill follow me because god
[55:07] has given me the vision and you're gonna
[55:09] be the people that's gonna help me bring
[55:10] this vision to pass
[55:13] i want you to watch this
[55:15] peter never said
[55:17] follow me
[55:20] peter was an apostle
[55:22] peter wrote two books of the bible
[55:25] peter never said follow me
[55:28] john was an apostle
[55:30] and a prophet he wrote the book of
[55:31] revelations john was an apostle and a
[55:34] prophet and he wrote three books of the
[55:36] bible he never said follow me
[55:39] why would paul
[55:41] feel so emboldened by the holy ghost
[55:44] not by his own penmanship
[55:46] but about four or five times in the
[55:48] bible paul heard these words if you want
[55:51] to serve god follow me
[55:53] if you want to know god follow me
[55:56] if you want the power of god follow me
[55:59] what will make a man tell a people such
[56:01] a thing as that that man had to have a
[56:03] revelation he knew he had a vision of
[56:05] thus saith the lord
[56:07] and whenever thus sailed lord is
[56:09] received and whenever thus said lord has
[56:11] acted on you'll always find the power of
[56:13] god come down upon thus far the lord if
[56:15] it's received and acted upon in the
[56:17] right way
[56:18] when cain and abel came out in the first
[56:20] book of the bible and worshiped god why
[56:22] did abel have a vindication because he
[56:25] wasn't operating by his own desire he
[56:27] was operating by a revelation when he
[56:29] built that altar he had thus said the
[56:31] lord cain had presumptions cain had
[56:34] ideas but he didn't have dust shared the
[56:36] lord
[56:37] when isaiah i mean asked isaiah when
[56:39] elijah came out and 400 prophets of baal
[56:41] why was it that it's only out of one out
[56:43] of 400 prophets against one why was it
[56:46] that one man had a pill of fire because
[56:48] he had thus said the lord and when thus
[56:50] said the lord is carried out you watch
[56:52] god that pleases the father and he comes
[56:55] down and dwells with those people
[56:58] and i want you to watch this
[57:00] paul said follow me
[57:02] paul wrote several books of the new
[57:03] testament
[57:05] paul was a preacher
[57:07] but he was more than a preacher
[57:10] paul was an apostle
[57:13] he was more than apostle
[57:15] paul had the gift of prophecy
[57:18] he was more than a prophet
[57:20] what made him more
[57:22] because paul had been given the
[57:24] revelation
[57:25] listen now
[57:27] for that age
[57:29] acabus was a prophet
[57:32] he never said follow me
[57:34] i want you to catch where i'm coming
[57:35] from now
[57:36] activists never had the revelation of
[57:39] god for that age against had a
[57:41] visitation and god told agaves i want
[57:43] you to go down here and i want you to be
[57:45] paul and i want you to baptize in the
[57:46] name of jesus christ for the remission
[57:48] of his sins and i'm going to give that
[57:50] man the holy ghost angebus already had
[57:51] the holy ghost
[57:53] but he didn't never say follow me why
[57:55] because god revealed the echoes this man
[57:57] is going to suffer many things my name
[57:59] because there's something i'm about to
[58:01] do that's going to set a tremble
[58:02] throughout israel i want you to watch
[58:03] this even the activists of prophet
[58:05] didn't know what that revelation was
[58:07] because that revelation wouldn't come to
[58:09] being until god called paul and when he
[58:11] called paulista paul i've ordained a
[58:14] messenger to the gentiles why because
[58:16] i'm turning a corner
[58:19] i'm not going the way of the old
[58:20] testament prophets i'm not going to wear
[58:22] the jews i'm not going to wear the law
[58:23] of moses i'm getting to turn the corner
[58:25] i'm turning the corner of grace and this
[58:27] grace isn't going to the jews it's not
[58:29] going to your brothers it's going to the
[58:31] gentiles and nobody knew that but paul
[58:33] why because he was ordained to bring
[58:36] that vision to that age to that
[58:37] generation
[58:40] and so if somebody would have tried to
[58:41] rebuild a jewish church they'd have been
[58:43] off the word they'd try to rebuild
[58:45] everything around the jewish law they'd
[58:46] been off the word but if you wanted thus
[58:48] saith the lord there was a man that god
[58:50] chose to bring that revelation and that
[58:52] man's name was the apostle paul
[58:56] that was a different revelation
[58:59] they had churches they had prophets they
[59:01] had laws but they never had a gentile
[59:03] bride
[59:05] that was a new thing
[59:07] and paul was ordained to be the man to
[59:09] bring that thing to pass now i want you
[59:11] to watch this
[59:13] paul was a messenger that age
[59:15] and he had a vision
[59:16] it was a new direction paul's vision was
[59:19] to bring a gentile people
[59:22] to the word of god for that age
[59:25] now i want you to watch as a leader
[59:27] what paul had to contend with
[59:30] when a man gets anointed like that
[59:33] sometimes people take their northern man
[59:35] and they get it out of position
[59:38] they start to focus too much on the man
[59:40] and not on god using the man
[59:43] there's a difference than the flesh and
[59:44] there's a difference than an anointing
[59:46] that's using the flesh or you follow me
[59:48] when you go to brother simmons house you
[59:50] might talk to him and say brother
[59:51] simmons and you might cut a joke with
[59:53] him but when he's had to pull up and
[59:54] that anointing is upon him i would have
[59:56] dare you not to cut a joke with him at
[59:57] that time while under the anointing it's
[59:59] a different it's a different thing why
[1:00:01] god now is using that tabernacle
[1:00:04] and then when god began to use paul to
[1:00:06] bring forth his vision for that age the
[1:00:08] people that age began to get out of line
[1:00:10] and some began to say i'm a paul and i'm
[1:00:12] of apollos why they begin to look at how
[1:00:14] god was using these men and they began
[1:00:16] to get the ministry out of line why
[1:00:18] because they didn't have the revelation
[1:00:20] of what god was actually doing they
[1:00:21] could see the man operating but they
[1:00:23] couldn't catch the revelation of what
[1:00:25] god was revealing by
[1:00:26] vision and so paul as a man had to deal
[1:00:29] with that he said have i ever baptized
[1:00:31] you did i save you did i die for your
[1:00:34] sins paul had to give them back in line
[1:00:36] yes i've got the revelation yes i'm
[1:00:38] bringing a vision but you got to catch a
[1:00:40] vision of exactly what i'm bringing you
[1:00:42] otherwise you'll get out of line
[1:00:44] following the man and not following the
[1:00:46] message that the man is bringing
[1:00:49] many of these people that paul wrote to
[1:00:51] him said follow me paul never shook
[1:00:52] their hands
[1:00:54] paul never broke bread with them
[1:00:56] they never got baptized by paul they
[1:00:58] never met paul
[1:01:00] they may have gotten saved to come in
[1:01:02] later on many years that the paul never
[1:01:04] came back to corinthians after that
[1:01:05] point but yet they believed what paul
[1:01:07] preached
[1:01:09] and they were followers of his message
[1:01:12] and paul was addressing that group
[1:01:14] you may have ten thousand instructors
[1:01:17] oh you'll have preachers after preachers
[1:01:19] of preachers and good ones too brother
[1:01:21] ernest good ones
[1:01:23] passed out the pastor you and good ones
[1:01:26] good men of god
[1:01:28] but they were ordained to bring you a
[1:01:30] message
[1:01:31] and the message that he ordained to
[1:01:32] bring was my vision for this age and
[1:01:35] that vision of the age didn't come by
[1:01:36] ten thousand men it came by one man
[1:01:39] and that man's name was paul
[1:01:41] or you follow me and so paul was given a
[1:01:44] ministry to bring all these different
[1:01:46] people together listen under a unity of
[1:01:49] faith
[1:01:50] that christ in that age might be made
[1:01:53] manifested or you follow me let me keep
[1:01:56] going
[1:01:57] paul had the mind of god he wasn't just
[1:01:59] bringing preaching he was bringing the
[1:02:01] vision from the mind of god thus said
[1:02:04] the lord for that age and what was he
[1:02:06] doing building a gentile bride
[1:02:13] and this age that we're living in
[1:02:16] it also needed a vision
[1:02:20] we had baptists
[1:02:22] they had visions
[1:02:25] we've got methodists
[1:02:27] they had visions
[1:02:29] we had apostolic
[1:02:31] they had visions
[1:02:33] jehovah witness
[1:02:34] seven day events on and on and on each
[1:02:38] church had built a platform
[1:02:41] for their vision
[1:02:43] but none of them had the vision of what
[1:02:45] god actually
[1:02:47] it
[1:02:48] or you follow me
[1:02:50] so god had to send one man
[1:02:54] anointed with his spirit
[1:02:56] that had the revelation and ability to
[1:02:59] take this word
[1:03:00] and to bring certain scriptures together
[1:03:03] to bring forth the vision of god for
[1:03:05] this age
[1:03:06] paul didn't do it by his intellect he
[1:03:08] was a man that was much learned far
[1:03:10] beyond many teachers of his age but it
[1:03:12] wasn't his intellect that was able to
[1:03:14] catch the vision it was the holy ghost
[1:03:16] that came upon paul that revealed to
[1:03:18] paul this is my vision for this age and
[1:03:21] paul stayed with that holy ghost
[1:03:23] teaching to make sure that people were
[1:03:24] dressed in the word of god that god
[1:03:26] wanted to see and walk in for the age in
[1:03:28] which paul was living and so god in his
[1:03:30] last days in order to get a people ready
[1:03:32] for a bride ready for a rapture ready to
[1:03:35] get out of here god wanted to see people
[1:03:36] dressed a certain way walk a certain way
[1:03:39] act a certain way and live a certain way
[1:03:41] and god said i've got to send a message
[1:03:43] an open vision listen to church and open
[1:03:45] vision to this generation that they
[1:03:47] might know just said the lord
[1:03:50] and open visions don't come by teachers
[1:03:53] they don't come by apostles they don't
[1:03:55] come by pastors open visions only come
[1:03:58] by thus said the lord and that takes the
[1:04:00] prophet of god
[1:04:04] now let me keep going
[1:04:06] let me keep going
[1:04:08] this prophet has a calling
[1:04:12] his car is to bring the people to a
[1:04:13] vision
[1:04:15] the vision that god had for this age
[1:04:18] didn't come about last year
[1:04:21] it didn't come about ten years ago
[1:04:24] it didn't come about a hundred years ago
[1:04:27] the vision god had for this age listen
[1:04:30] was in his mind
[1:04:32] before the foundation of the world
[1:04:34] before the world began the bible said he
[1:04:36] saw the end
[1:04:38] from the beginning and being that he
[1:04:40] could see the end from beginning he
[1:04:42] mapped out every age after every age
[1:04:43] after every age he saw the day he
[1:04:45] created adam he saw the day adam fall he
[1:04:47] saw the day he created eve he saw the
[1:04:49] dates
[1:04:50] took eve out of the body and the day she
[1:04:52] failed are you following me he saw the
[1:04:53] day that in which he gave uh the
[1:04:55] vindication of abel and the day in which
[1:04:57] he rejected cain god saw everything
[1:04:59] happening day after day week after week
[1:05:02] years here all the way down until the
[1:05:04] end of time where there shall be time no
[1:05:06] more and all things be brought back unto
[1:05:08] him
[1:05:09] god saw the complete plan
[1:05:11] and then he wrote it out
[1:05:13] in a vision brother simmons
[1:05:17] just like that man wrote this church out
[1:05:19] said brother simmons you told me what
[1:05:21] you wanted how does this look and
[1:05:22] brother simmons says that's what i had
[1:05:24] in mind
[1:05:25] god called prophets they wrote the word
[1:05:27] and said god this is what you gave us
[1:05:30] this is what you revealed to us and they
[1:05:31] wrote god's thoughts listen in a book
[1:05:34] called the scriptures and what was god
[1:05:36] doing he was writing out the plan for
[1:05:38] the entire human race from the beginning
[1:05:40] of genesis all the way to the last one
[1:05:42] in revelations every generation has been
[1:05:44] identified in the scriptures
[1:05:47] and what god wants you to do listen and
[1:05:51] what god wants me to do
[1:05:53] is be able to identify ourself
[1:05:56] in our age
[1:05:58] in the word
[1:06:00] when christ came 2000 years ago what did
[1:06:02] he rebuke that church world for he said
[1:06:05] if you only knew the day
[1:06:07] of your visitation you know when the
[1:06:09] sun's shining in the rain this thing the
[1:06:11] sun shines low that it's going to be
[1:06:12] rain tomorrow and you know when the wind
[1:06:14] blows a certain way certain things you
[1:06:16] have tomorrow he said but can't you
[1:06:17] discern the signs of the time they
[1:06:19] couldn't recognize the day in which the
[1:06:21] scripture for their generation was being
[1:06:23] fulfilled but yet it was perfectly the
[1:06:25] plan in the mind of god
[1:06:28] thank you brother you see where i'm
[1:06:30] coming from it wasn't a new vision
[1:06:33] isaiah talked about it malachi talked
[1:06:35] about it jeremiah talked about it and
[1:06:38] jesus christ was limited to the letter
[1:06:39] and yet people could see it and not
[1:06:41] recognize the vision of god the word of
[1:06:43] god was unfolding
[1:06:46] but john the baptist being a prophet he
[1:06:48] recognized it he said there's one
[1:06:50] standing among you that you don't even
[1:06:52] know but being i'm a prophet i recognize
[1:06:54] the word when it comes to me
[1:06:58] the pharisees couldn't do it the
[1:07:00] sadducees couldn't do it
[1:07:02] but john was built as a prophet
[1:07:04] to do it
[1:07:05] why is that
[1:07:07] let me show you something
[1:07:09] let's go to the book of
[1:07:10] oh i believe it's the book of amos
[1:07:13] amos chapter 3.
[1:07:15] and i want you to follow me for a little
[1:07:17] bit i'm bringing us to a point
[1:07:20] amos chapter 3
[1:07:22] you see you are in god's mind
[1:07:25] before the foundation of the world paul
[1:07:28] wrote in ephesians chapter 1 verse 4
[1:07:31] god chose you
[1:07:34] in christ jesus
[1:07:36] before
[1:07:38] the foundation of the
[1:07:40] world well if he chose me brother ernest
[1:07:43] what in the world did he choose me to do
[1:07:46] what in the world does he want of me
[1:07:49] if he told he chose paul to be an
[1:07:51] apostle and an angel messenger unto a
[1:07:54] first age to bring the gentiles to
[1:07:56] christ that's what he chose paul for but
[1:07:58] brother simmons what did he choose me
[1:07:59] for
[1:08:00] if he had me in his mind before the
[1:08:02] foundation of the world what was he
[1:08:03] thinking about me i have no way of going
[1:08:06] back there i have no way of looking past
[1:08:07] a partial time so god said i provided a
[1:08:09] way for every generation to know what
[1:08:12] i'm thinking
[1:08:13] i'm going to give you a portal a way for
[1:08:15] my word of god to come to your
[1:08:17] generation that somebody could speak to
[1:08:19] you and say brother holloway this is
[1:08:21] what god thinks to you
[1:08:24] and if i'm obtained to that when i hear
[1:08:26] those words like that brother said
[1:08:28] something in him told him you weren't
[1:08:29] ordained to live like that you could
[1:08:31] have been that way for another 10 years
[1:08:33] but that voice would have never stopped
[1:08:35] you were not ordained to live like that
[1:08:37] something on the inside has to call you
[1:08:38] and say come out of that my people
[1:08:43] that's a predestination and for ordained
[1:08:45] election of god
[1:08:49] why does every family member not grab it
[1:08:51] why does every friend not grab it
[1:08:52] everybody doesn't have this in them but
[1:08:54] it's ordained to a certain people
[1:08:57] and you're that people
[1:09:01] before i read aim at three let me read
[1:09:02] one scripture to you matthew 13 10 watch
[1:09:05] the paul says why watch christ says
[1:09:07] about this
[1:09:09] and the disciples came to him matthew 13
[1:09:11] 10 and the disciples came and said unto
[1:09:13] him why speaker thoughts of them in
[1:09:15] parables when you're preaching to the
[1:09:16] public why don't you talk plainer to
[1:09:18] them like you talk to us why do you have
[1:09:20] to use parables watch what he says and
[1:09:22] he answered and said unto them because
[1:09:24] it is given to you to know the message
[1:09:26] of the kingdom of heaven but unto them
[1:09:28] it is not given god has some people to
[1:09:30] reveal it to and some people he's going
[1:09:32] to hide it from
[1:09:35] that's his election
[1:09:36] i can't judge him on that i can't
[1:09:38] question all that if he's sovereign
[1:09:40] that's his sovereignty i show whom i
[1:09:42] love my love i precious my person that's
[1:09:44] the election of god
[1:09:47] can only thank god tonight that he
[1:09:49] called me to be one of them
[1:09:50] or you follow me
[1:09:53] but in order for me to catch what's in
[1:09:54] the mind of god
[1:09:56] the bible said that my name listen
[1:09:58] your name if you want to his was written
[1:10:00] on the land's book of life
[1:10:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:05] what god thought about you he already
[1:10:07] had written in a book
[1:10:10] well how am i gonna know what's in that
[1:10:12] book god said i'm gonna send you eyes
[1:10:15] a seer
[1:10:16] somebody that can see beyond the realm
[1:10:18] of flesh they can see beyond the realm
[1:10:20] of time that that was built that their
[1:10:22] mind could tap into eternity and see
[1:10:25] what i was thinking before the
[1:10:27] foundation of the world
[1:10:29] these men are called prophets
[1:10:32] that's not gift of prophets that's not
[1:10:34] activists that can see a vision that's
[1:10:36] not that this prophet here is a
[1:10:38] different man brother brown said you get
[1:10:39] one to a generation
[1:10:42] in activist day there might have been a
[1:10:44] hundred prophets a thousand prophets
[1:10:46] that had thus said the lord and they
[1:10:48] came to pass
[1:10:49] but not one of them could write a book
[1:10:51] and say follow me
[1:10:54] they weren't given the vision for that
[1:10:56] age they had a part to play but the
[1:10:58] vision wasn't theirs but they had to be
[1:11:00] willing to line up to god's vision and
[1:11:02] the activists god said go to paul and
[1:11:04] baptize back and say i don't want to do
[1:11:06] it
[1:11:07] this man is killing people
[1:11:09] he said you're going to have to line up
[1:11:10] with the vision
[1:11:11] because this man is going to be the
[1:11:12] messenger
[1:11:13] that i'm sending to a gentile pride
[1:11:16] or you follow me
[1:11:18] now watch what
[1:11:19] how do we get these mysteries
[1:11:21] how do we find out what god was thinking
[1:11:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:27] now i know listen now
[1:11:28] i know
[1:11:29] most of you at least know exactly what
[1:11:31] i'm talking about
[1:11:32] so don't think i'm preaching this
[1:11:34] elementary for that reason i want to
[1:11:36] make sure i land the foundation tight
[1:11:38] enough
[1:11:39] then when i get to my point you
[1:11:41] understand where i'm coming from you see
[1:11:42] what i'm saying
[1:11:43] i want to make sure the foundation is
[1:11:45] tight enough
[1:11:46] where if you hear this for the first
[1:11:47] time
[1:11:48] you say brother holloway i see where you
[1:11:50] coming from or you follow me listen amos
[1:11:54] 3 7
[1:11:55] surely the lord god will do nothing
[1:11:58] but revealeth his secrets unto who
[1:12:01] his servants
[1:12:02] the prophets
[1:12:04] so this mystery mind that god had before
[1:12:07] the foundation of the world where he was
[1:12:09] writing books where god was seeing
[1:12:11] visions where god could look down
[1:12:13] through time and see what's happened all
[1:12:14] these things will happen in the mind of
[1:12:16] god god said but the only ones that i'm
[1:12:17] going to reveal these mysteries too
[1:12:21] we'll be prophets
[1:12:23] so brother holloway
[1:12:25] is going to find his name
[1:12:27] and know what i call them too
[1:12:29] it's going to take a prophet to catch my
[1:12:31] mind
[1:12:32] bring that word
[1:12:34] preach that word
[1:12:35] as an open vision
[1:12:38] that holloway could see the vision
[1:12:40] and choose to walk in it
[1:12:43] because without a vision listen
[1:12:45] the people
[1:12:47] perish
[1:12:49] you will never wander into this
[1:12:52] you'll never stumble into it you'll
[1:12:54] never add paul said in ephesians chapter
[1:12:56] three it's the unsearchable
[1:12:59] riches of christ
[1:13:01] without a prophet without you see you
[1:13:03] will never see it
[1:13:08] there's a bride about to take around
[1:13:10] listen there's a bride about to take a
[1:13:11] rapture
[1:13:13] she's not going to stumble into it she's
[1:13:15] not going to wander into it she's gonna
[1:13:17] walk wise wide open into it why is it
[1:13:20] because she had someone to come with a
[1:13:22] message to tell her i'm announcing a
[1:13:24] coming the coming of the lord is at hand
[1:13:26] this is the generation
[1:13:31] and he brought god's vision how to dress
[1:13:33] that bride to make sure she don't miss
[1:13:35] it and she's going to walk into it
[1:13:36] perfectly dressed up all white singing
[1:13:39] armored christian soldier marching or
[1:13:41] why she sees it and she's following the
[1:13:43] voice of god not the man she's following
[1:13:46] the message that came out of the man
[1:13:51] i never shook his head i never broke
[1:13:53] bread with him but i believe what he
[1:13:55] preached was thus saying the lord
[1:13:59] and it's been ordering my steps ever
[1:14:01] since
[1:14:04] are you following me
[1:14:07] because the wrestling with that
[1:14:08] is to wrestle with god
[1:14:11] aaron and marian didn't have that
[1:14:13] revelation
[1:14:15] moses was too close to him brother
[1:14:17] that was his brother
[1:14:19] aaron was his brother mary was his
[1:14:21] brother or sister
[1:14:23] they saw brother moses
[1:14:25] and moses
[1:14:26] preached don't marry gentiles
[1:14:30] hebrews marry hebrews
[1:14:32] and what do moses go do
[1:14:37] sound like a hypocrite don't it
[1:14:39] he telling me don't marry gentiles
[1:14:41] and then you go get this ethiopian
[1:14:43] a black woman
[1:14:47] sounds hypocritical don't it
[1:14:49] and they thought they had listen they
[1:14:50] thought they had the right
[1:14:52] to question his integrity
[1:14:55] all it did was remember one to another
[1:14:56] well aaron you know your brother your
[1:14:59] brother he
[1:15:00] he ain't sticking with his own message
[1:15:01] well mary you know i i don't know why he
[1:15:03] did it look wrong to me too i think
[1:15:05] you're wrong and why they get murmured
[1:15:08] and presented this thing to moses moses
[1:15:11] we ain't sure you're doing right
[1:15:13] the bible said god heard it
[1:15:16] god heard it and god came down
[1:15:19] and when he came down he called the
[1:15:21] bible said he called a three to him and
[1:15:23] when all three approached moses aaron
[1:15:25] and miriam he told moses standing here
[1:15:27] and he took a step back further he said
[1:15:29] i remember y'all come here
[1:15:31] what he was about to rebuke them why
[1:15:33] they didn't recognize the voice of god
[1:15:36] in a man
[1:15:39] to question what he was preaching wasn't
[1:15:41] the question the man
[1:15:43] to question what he was preaching was
[1:15:45] questioning the one that told him to
[1:15:47] preach it
[1:15:50] you see how these questions have gotten
[1:15:52] so many people confused they're
[1:15:53] questioning things that their mind human
[1:15:55] mind cannot and is not capable of
[1:15:58] understanding
[1:15:59] it goes in a realm of the eternal
[1:16:01] thoughts of god and god said my thoughts
[1:16:03] are not your thoughts and my way is not
[1:16:05] your way you'll never fully understand
[1:16:07] my thinking but what you can't
[1:16:09] understand is what i called you to do in
[1:16:11] the age in which you're living
[1:16:13] aaron wants to be a priest be a priest
[1:16:15] don't question the prophet marian wants
[1:16:17] to play the tambourine and sing songs
[1:16:19] and lead the sister mary and do that
[1:16:20] don't question the message
[1:16:22] or you follow me every one of us got a
[1:16:24] calling abide in your calling and
[1:16:26] fulfill the will of god
[1:16:30] but when you try to go into a prophet's
[1:16:31] mind now we're getting out of step
[1:16:35] we don't question his mind
[1:16:37] but his gift
[1:16:39] can question your mind
[1:16:42] that's his vindication
[1:16:44] like that time when god came down and
[1:16:46] talked to abraham
[1:16:48] and mary and and was his wife named
[1:16:50] sarah was in the tent what was she doing
[1:16:53] questioning god
[1:16:56] in a tabernacle afresh
[1:16:58] and he can question her heart
[1:17:01] why did you think such a thing or why
[1:17:03] did you say such a thing
[1:17:04] and she could truthfully say in her lips
[1:17:06] i never spoken utterance he said but i
[1:17:08] can question your heart because i know
[1:17:10] what you're thinking
[1:17:12] it was the vindication that god was
[1:17:14] present or you follow me and so when god
[1:17:17] came down in my age what did he want to
[1:17:20] do with that gift he wanted to use that
[1:17:22] gift just to vindicate i'm present
[1:17:25] if in case you don't recognize it this
[1:17:27] message is not a message of a man
[1:17:29] he might have his faults but follow the
[1:17:32] message
[1:17:33] and i'm going to show you in a minute
[1:17:34] while i'm going this way father why why
[1:17:36] follow the message because the message
[1:17:38] wasn't the man the message was thus said
[1:17:40] of the lord it was god and god was there
[1:17:42] to vindicate his presence to the people
[1:17:45] now i want you to watch this why am i
[1:17:46] going this way i want you to watch this
[1:17:48] jeremiah chapter one
[1:17:51] these men were four ordained to their
[1:17:52] position
[1:17:54] jeremiah 1 4 says then the word of the
[1:17:56] lord came unto me saying before i formed
[1:17:58] thee in the belly i knew thee and before
[1:18:01] thou came forth out of the womb i
[1:18:02] sanctified thee and ordained thee of
[1:18:04] prophet to the nations god needed a
[1:18:07] voice in that generation to say thus
[1:18:09] said the lord and he built the man
[1:18:11] before he was ever born he put the gift
[1:18:13] in him to fulfill that part of the word
[1:18:17] or you follow me
[1:18:18] every prophet comes the same way
[1:18:21] with the vision to the generation
[1:18:22] jeremiah wasn't just to the jews god
[1:18:24] said you're a different prophet jeremiah
[1:18:26] i'm ordaining you to the nations
[1:18:29] you're going to preach the uh
[1:18:31] uh all kind of all kind of kings not
[1:18:34] just the jews now i want you to watch
[1:18:36] this
[1:18:37] paul had the same calling i'm skipped
[1:18:39] there for time's sake
[1:18:41] these men
[1:18:42] not only have a gift of a prophet
[1:18:46] but the word comes to them because of
[1:18:48] that gift
[1:18:50] and the word anoints them in a certain
[1:18:51] way
[1:18:53] and the word that anoints them manifests
[1:18:56] the god-given sign
[1:18:58] of the son of man
[1:19:00] but the sign is only listen now to
[1:19:02] attract attention
[1:19:06] i'm not sticking with the message
[1:19:07] because brother brown deserves some
[1:19:08] woman's heart in chicago
[1:19:12] that caught my attention
[1:19:13] when i saw a deep caller deep and i saw
[1:19:15] this little man on the platform doing
[1:19:17] this and that and that and i'm like is
[1:19:18] this real
[1:19:20] and then people begin to give
[1:19:20] testimonies oh yeah i was in the service
[1:19:22] i heard so so-and-so had a chance to sit
[1:19:24] down and talk brother brother face to
[1:19:25] face tip it brother biscuit i asked
[1:19:26] questions about the message this and
[1:19:28] that and that had a chance to meet
[1:19:28] people that were there
[1:19:30] but that's not what kept me
[1:19:32] that caught my attention
[1:19:35] what's keeping me
[1:19:36] was when i heard what the what he
[1:19:38] preached
[1:19:40] i began to see something in the
[1:19:41] scripture
[1:19:42] that made the bible a new book
[1:19:44] it was no longer just do's and don'ts
[1:19:47] sisters you dressed this way brothers
[1:19:48] you conduct yourself that way the bible
[1:19:50] was elevated to a different kind of book
[1:19:53] i began to see god's thoughts listen
[1:19:56] god's mind for this generation
[1:19:58] unfolding on the pages of the book
[1:20:01] i can now take governments and place
[1:20:04] them in the bible i can now take the
[1:20:06] generation and place them in the bible i
[1:20:08] can now take movements like people
[1:20:09] rights and human rights and place some
[1:20:11] things i can now begin to see the world
[1:20:13] i live in in a different way why the
[1:20:15] bible is a new book i see myself and the
[1:20:18] world that i'm living in why i see it
[1:20:19] through the eyes of a vindicated prophet
[1:20:25] and so while some are arguing whether it
[1:20:27] was 16 men or 14 men or i don't care
[1:20:29] about that that was just a sign but now
[1:20:32] i'm hooked to the voice that followed
[1:20:35] the sign
[1:20:38] or wicked in the dungeon generation
[1:20:39] sticking out to the side i'm not seeking
[1:20:41] aside i'm seeking the voice that
[1:20:43] followed the sign
[1:20:48] now why is this so important
[1:20:51] let me jump to the parachute
[1:20:53] why is it so important
[1:20:56] this man these men
[1:20:58] they're ordained with a message for
[1:20:59] their generation
[1:21:01] and that message begins to place things
[1:21:06] it places
[1:21:07] modern events
[1:21:09] made clear
[1:21:11] by prophecy
[1:21:14] god knew the end from beginning
[1:21:16] and he could tell to the detail
[1:21:19] the day jesus christ would be crucified
[1:21:22] if he could deal to the detail
[1:21:24] the day the pentecost would happen
[1:21:27] if he could tell down to the time john
[1:21:29] the baptist would step on the scene and
[1:21:31] preach his first sermon
[1:21:33] if god could know that for that
[1:21:34] generation
[1:21:36] i'ma ask you a question
[1:21:37] can he know the same for your generation
[1:21:42] does he know what's going to happen
[1:21:43] month by month
[1:21:45] day by day year by year week does he
[1:21:47] know what's going to happen
[1:21:49] well if he can write those details in
[1:21:50] the bible for that generation can he do
[1:21:53] the same listen for your generation
[1:21:56] can your generation can your day and
[1:21:58] this message be just as clearly
[1:22:00] identified by the bible
[1:22:02] and your place in that message be just
[1:22:04] as clearly identified by the bible
[1:22:07] so your faith is not on flesh but your
[1:22:09] faith is on a message that reveals to
[1:22:11] you your generation your age its message
[1:22:14] and your place in it
[1:22:17] now watch this
[1:22:18] let me give you
[1:22:20] jump to the punch line
[1:22:22] this leadership is not a man this
[1:22:24] leadership is a prophet
[1:22:26] and the people here is prophet's message
[1:22:28] and they begin to say amen
[1:22:31] it's like a brother said
[1:22:33] something began to speak to him
[1:22:36] and he began to yield to it
[1:22:38] following simply means yielding
[1:22:41] when brother simmons might have said i
[1:22:42] want a church i don't know how many
[1:22:43] people please see
[1:22:45] you're not at maximum capacity when he's
[1:22:47] going to the pews this room could be
[1:22:48] more appeals if he wants to
[1:22:50] but he put them out he thought he needed
[1:22:51] for that time
[1:22:53] but let's say brother simmons would have
[1:22:54] said i'm building a church that'll seat
[1:22:56] i'm going to say 300.
[1:22:59] somebody else might have said brother
[1:23:00] simmons
[1:23:01] don't you want to go with 400
[1:23:03] because god gonna bless your ministry
[1:23:05] you're gonna need more seats then
[1:23:07] somebody might say well brother simmons
[1:23:08] we ain't got but 150.
[1:23:10] don't we need a smaller church 150. see
[1:23:12] you got confusion
[1:23:14] but somebody's got to have a vision
[1:23:16] to say this is the exact number we're
[1:23:18] going to use and then listen and
[1:23:21] everybody else to follow that vision has
[1:23:24] to drop their ideas
[1:23:26] and say 300 is it
[1:23:29] i thought 500 i thought 150 but when he
[1:23:32] said 300 that's settled it why because
[1:23:35] god ordained him with the papers to
[1:23:37] carry the vision forward
[1:23:39] now all he needed was somebody to get
[1:23:40] behind him to make sure the vision comes
[1:23:43] to pass
[1:23:44] now i want you to watch this
[1:23:46] i want you to notice this
[1:23:49] the vision for this age
[1:23:51] was given only i want you to watch this
[1:23:53] for the elected
[1:23:55] it wasn't for everybody
[1:23:57] watch what paul says
[1:23:59] paul says in the book of
[1:24:01] second timothy chapter 2
[1:24:03] wherefore i suffer trouble as an evil
[1:24:05] doer
[1:24:06] even unto bonds listen but watch what
[1:24:08] he's saying but the word of god is not
[1:24:11] bound
[1:24:12] paul was not
[1:24:14] the key in terms of his flesh
[1:24:17] they could lock the man in prison and he
[1:24:19] could still write the word of god and
[1:24:21] send it out of prison why the word
[1:24:23] wasn't bound they wasn't following the
[1:24:25] flesh they was following a message
[1:24:29] listen
[1:24:31] therefore i undo all things listen
[1:24:34] for the
[1:24:35] elect's sake
[1:24:38] he wasn't sending a message to save the
[1:24:40] world
[1:24:43] christ said
[1:24:44] i'll come back and you shall see me but
[1:24:47] the world the cosmos
[1:24:50] shall not see me
[1:24:52] the message never comes for the world
[1:24:55] the message comes for the
[1:24:56] elect god said behold i send
[1:25:00] you
[1:25:01] elijah
[1:25:02] that was a specific
[1:25:04] group
[1:25:05] or you follow me
[1:25:07] you're that group
[1:25:09] now i want you to understand something
[1:25:10] the reason he sent elijah with a vision
[1:25:12] was the same reason paul came with a
[1:25:14] vision
[1:25:15] paul introduced a gentile bride turning
[1:25:18] from the jews to the gentiles
[1:25:21] our messenger
[1:25:23] reinstates the gentile bride in her
[1:25:26] proper position
[1:25:27] as god is now leaving the gentiles
[1:25:30] to go back to the jews
[1:25:32] or you follow me
[1:25:34] these prophets are needed because
[1:25:36] they're dispensational changes that are
[1:25:38] taking place but then that prophet
[1:25:41] begins to place everything by the word
[1:25:43] and this is what i want to get to in
[1:25:45] closing
[1:25:47] they don't just place
[1:25:49] the elect by the word
[1:25:51] they place that entire
[1:25:53] generation
[1:25:56] when moses preached he didn't just place
[1:25:58] israel in the promised land
[1:26:01] he plays pharaoh
[1:26:02] or you follow me he placed the magicians
[1:26:05] he began to place everything that was
[1:26:06] happening everything was being judged by
[1:26:09] moses message
[1:26:11] or you follow me
[1:26:13] when christ came he didn't just deal
[1:26:15] with peter james and john he dealt with
[1:26:17] judas
[1:26:18] he dealt with kyphosis his message began
[1:26:20] to reveal and place everything in his
[1:26:23] generation
[1:26:25] judas fulfilled the word just as much as
[1:26:27] peter did
[1:26:29] but the difference was peter revealed
[1:26:31] the word of the elect and went on to
[1:26:34] receive the holy ghost judas fulfilled
[1:26:36] the wrong scripture because he was blind
[1:26:38] to the word that was being made manifest
[1:26:40] in front of him
[1:26:43] or you follow me
[1:26:44] so while one fulfills scripture blindly
[1:26:46] he fulfills the wrong scripture peter by
[1:26:49] revelation goes to pentecost and
[1:26:51] fulfills the right scripture
[1:26:53] you see what i'm getting at so when this
[1:26:55] message begins to preach it begins to
[1:26:57] place that entire generation and their
[1:26:59] attitude toward his message begins to
[1:27:01] place them
[1:27:02] some are fulfilling the word blindly
[1:27:05] and some are doing it walking with their
[1:27:07] eyes wide open by revelation
[1:27:11] able fulfilled it with revelation can't
[1:27:13] fulfill the wrong scripture blindly
[1:27:17] moses fulfills it by revelation balaam
[1:27:19] does the wrong scripture blindly
[1:27:22] jeremiah does it by revelation hannah
[1:27:24] does the wrong scripture blindly and
[1:27:26] they're all acquainted with the word of
[1:27:28] god
[1:27:30] are you following me
[1:27:31] so what are you getting at brother
[1:27:32] holloway
[1:27:34] we're watching the headlines i'm closing
[1:27:36] we're watching the headlines
[1:27:38] what's happening
[1:27:41] bro siblings
[1:27:42] everybody what's putin doing
[1:27:45] what's putin doing
[1:27:47] well i go on the internet i pull it up
[1:27:51] let me see what the pundits are saying
[1:27:53] let me see what the reporters are saying
[1:27:55] let me see what they're saying over
[1:27:56] there in uh in the in the middle east
[1:27:59] let me see what they're saying on bbc
[1:28:02] let me see what they're saying on the
[1:28:03] religious stations let me see what all
[1:28:05] these people are saying everybody got
[1:28:07] their opinion
[1:28:09] what's putin doing
[1:28:11] you know putin was placed
[1:28:12] according to the word for this age
[1:28:16] the messenger said he never said to
[1:28:18] watch communism
[1:28:20] he never said watch the soviet union he
[1:28:22] said watch russia
[1:28:28] he said when russia
[1:28:29] gets into that position
[1:28:32] america is going to strike a war with
[1:28:34] her
[1:28:36] you know this whole military this thing
[1:28:37] happened right now it ain't just about
[1:28:39] ukraine
[1:28:40] if you listen to putin's own interviews
[1:28:42] that they've been given a man he said
[1:28:44] it's about the united states getting
[1:28:46] involved in world business that's
[1:28:47] affecting his country and the man is
[1:28:49] right about what he's saying
[1:28:51] our government is one of the most
[1:28:53] meddling governments in the world
[1:28:56] all of them are russia's meddling
[1:28:57] china's meddling they all are mailing
[1:29:00] none of them are being honest
[1:29:02] forgive me for saying that about my own
[1:29:03] country
[1:29:06] but the bible said when christ was
[1:29:08] carried upon a mountain he said and
[1:29:10] satan showed them all the kingdoms of
[1:29:11] the world
[1:29:12] satan said they all belong to
[1:29:15] me
[1:29:18] christ never denied that
[1:29:20] but the bible said in revelation when he
[1:29:21] comes back as king of kings he's going
[1:29:23] to bring down all
[1:29:25] nations
[1:29:26] all but america
[1:29:28] y'all good people over here oh what
[1:29:30] america
[1:29:32] it's as corrupt as any of them
[1:29:35] are you following me
[1:29:37] so our prophet placed this nation by his
[1:29:39] message
[1:29:41] he began to place russia by the message
[1:29:45] he said that this country was going to
[1:29:46] come to a spot that by giving the woman
[1:29:49] a right to vote they're going to elect
[1:29:50] the wrong man listen
[1:29:53] and in doing so there's going to be a
[1:29:54] lady that's going to rise to power
[1:29:57] either be president or vice president he
[1:29:59] gave seven visions that everyone he gave
[1:30:02] before they ever came to pass he said
[1:30:04] watch over germany they're going to
[1:30:06] raise up a dictator when he prophesied
[1:30:08] that you know hitler was just a
[1:30:09] chancellor he was a man that was
[1:30:11] appointed to an office he wasn't even
[1:30:12] elected he just a man appointed to
[1:30:14] another he's a chancellor brother
[1:30:15] branham said that man is going to be a
[1:30:17] german he's going to be out of australia
[1:30:19] he's going to be a dictator he's going
[1:30:20] to lead the world to the next world war
[1:30:21] and it happened exactly like that man
[1:30:23] said it was going to happen
[1:30:26] what was god showing you've got the
[1:30:28] voice of god in your generation
[1:30:31] how could a man see something like that
[1:30:33] before it ever happens
[1:30:34] hitler was a nobody but then after that
[1:30:36] prophecy went forth only a couple years
[1:30:38] later he became a somebody
[1:30:41] and then eight year four years no six
[1:30:42] years after that then he became the head
[1:30:44] of germany and led them into world war
[1:30:46] ii
[1:30:47] just exactly according to the state of
[1:30:49] the lord
[1:30:50] there were seven visions
[1:30:52] five of them had come to pass before
[1:30:54] that prophet died
[1:30:56] he said there's two more left
[1:30:58] he said one arm is the catholic church
[1:31:00] is going to take over this nation
[1:31:04] he said you're going to elect another
[1:31:05] catholic president probably
[1:31:07] and she's going to take up this nation
[1:31:09] you know joe biden's catholic
[1:31:12] he controls the executive
[1:31:14] branch you know
[1:31:16] the chief justice
[1:31:18] but the supreme court is catholic
[1:31:20] and if not mistaken i think there's six
[1:31:22] or seven catholics on the supreme court
[1:31:24] they control our bench
[1:31:26] the head
[1:31:27] of the house representative the largest
[1:31:30] legislative body in america
[1:31:32] is run by nancy pelosi
[1:31:34] a woman
[1:31:35] who's also catholic
[1:31:37] they now control our three main branches
[1:31:39] superior branches of government
[1:31:42] according to thus said the lord
[1:31:44] the day joe biden got inaugurated
[1:31:47] who did he have by his side
[1:31:49] brother branham gave a sign
[1:31:51] of what was going to be a sign when this
[1:31:53] woman rises to power
[1:31:55] he says she'll be elected president or
[1:31:57] vice president and she'll be a beautiful
[1:31:59] woman and she'll be wearing a purple
[1:32:00] dress
[1:32:02] how many realize that go look the
[1:32:04] internet up
[1:32:05] kamala harris does not wear dresses
[1:32:08] you see that woman in any kind of public
[1:32:10] position she's in a path of pants
[1:32:13] brother i said what does that mean that
[1:32:15] means she's left the headship
[1:32:17] of man and she's out of her position
[1:32:20] that's what that garment represents
[1:32:23] and that's what she wears but watch this
[1:32:25] woman what does she wear when she gets
[1:32:26] inaugurated the prophet didn't say she
[1:32:28] having a purple pantsuit the prophecy
[1:32:30] said she'll have on a purple dress
[1:32:34] and what did she put on for inauguration
[1:32:36] she couldn't help but put that outfit on
[1:32:38] she couldn't help but put a purple dress
[1:32:39] because she had to fulfill prophecy
[1:32:45] but she went into it blind
[1:32:47] she didn't know what she was fulfilling
[1:32:49] but i want you to watch this why am i
[1:32:50] saying this
[1:32:52] if you go look at the internet i'm not
[1:32:54] advising anybody to do that i'm just
[1:32:55] saying that because sometimes
[1:32:57] i got to go there to get information
[1:33:00] you go to the internet i get a lot of
[1:33:01] information on internet you go to
[1:33:02] internet
[1:33:03] see this information
[1:33:05] there's now religious people are rising
[1:33:07] up
[1:33:09] that are saying this this man had six
[1:33:11] visions
[1:33:13] and they can go back through history and
[1:33:14] count them
[1:33:15] they all came to pass
[1:33:17] and this most recent one 60 something
[1:33:19] years after his death
[1:33:20] now coming to pass you've got nominal
[1:33:23] believers out there now saying
[1:33:26] this man must be
[1:33:28] a prophet
[1:33:30] and when the world starts to look toward
[1:33:32] the word you know you're at
[1:33:35] the end
[1:33:38] number six happened
[1:33:40] over a year and a half ago
[1:33:42] and in between number six and seven you
[1:33:45] know what's supposed to take place
[1:33:47] the bride
[1:33:49] goes home
[1:33:51] well what was number seven
[1:33:54] there's going to be a man rise up in
[1:33:55] russia
[1:33:56] that america is going to strike a war
[1:33:59] and that man is going to respond with
[1:34:01] nuclear destruction
[1:34:04] not with fire bombs
[1:34:06] not with ten bombs but enough to when
[1:34:08] that prophet said he saw the vision of
[1:34:09] america he said she was covered with
[1:34:11] craters
[1:34:13] coast to coast
[1:34:16] by nuclear destruction
[1:34:19] now what are the pundits saying about
[1:34:20] putin
[1:34:22] he's acting like a madman
[1:34:24] he's not acting like a man with sins
[1:34:26] what he's doing is unreasonable
[1:34:28] and why weren't he talking about it why
[1:34:30] were he listening about it why why
[1:34:32] wouldn't pharaoh listen to anybody
[1:34:35] god raised him up
[1:34:37] why would nebuchadnezzar not listen to
[1:34:39] anybody
[1:34:40] god raised him up
[1:34:42] and that prophet said god is going to
[1:34:43] raise up russia
[1:34:45] to judge this generation for rejecting
[1:34:48] the word of god
[1:34:50] and his nation is going to be chief in
[1:34:52] that destruction
[1:34:56] putin is not doing what putin is doing
[1:34:59] because he's calculating politics
[1:35:01] he's not doing what he's doing because
[1:35:03] he's trying to strategize how to build
[1:35:05] russia oh in his mind he may be thinking
[1:35:06] he's calculating politics in his mind
[1:35:08] he's thinking he's building russia but
[1:35:09] that ain't really his game really
[1:35:11] there's something else moving him the
[1:35:12] bible said god put in their heart to
[1:35:14] fulfill his will that the word of god
[1:35:16] may come to pass
[1:35:18] church get ready something's about to
[1:35:20] strike
[1:35:25] we watched every sign waved just right
[1:35:29] and now we're in between the last two
[1:35:31] one has happened
[1:35:33] and i don't have no day or hour i can't
[1:35:35] say to be one year two years ten years
[1:35:37] but i believe what we're witnessing
[1:35:39] church
[1:35:40] the musicians could come what we're
[1:35:42] witnessing
[1:35:43] is the closing
[1:35:45] of this prophecy
[1:35:48] what we're witnessing
[1:35:50] is that last prophecy
[1:35:52] about to come to pass
[1:35:54] and as putin is now starting to threat
[1:35:56] with nuclear bombs
[1:35:58] the reporter saying is surely he won't
[1:36:00] do it
[1:36:02] surely he won't do it
[1:36:04] one after another the ones in russia
[1:36:06] surely he won't do it
[1:36:07] the ones in europe
[1:36:09] surely
[1:36:10] nobody wants a nuclear war surely he
[1:36:12] won't do it
[1:36:13] you've got thus said the lord
[1:36:15] somebody in that country has been
[1:36:18] anointed
[1:36:19] to press that button
[1:36:22] and when he does
[1:36:23] it's over for this nation
[1:36:25] it's over for rome
[1:36:27] he's going to judge this nation for
[1:36:29] joining up with that harlot to try to
[1:36:31] destroy this world system and try to
[1:36:32] destroy russia are you following me
[1:36:35] they're going to be judged for their
[1:36:36] evil deeds
[1:36:38] and god had to raise up somebody
[1:36:41] to send down his judgment
[1:36:44] and brother branham said he ordained
[1:36:46] russia
[1:36:48] what are we watching
[1:36:50] i believe we're watching the last of the
[1:36:53] seven visions
[1:36:55] i don't want to be here to see it come
[1:36:56] to pass
[1:36:58] i i i believe it i don't bring him i
[1:37:00] don't need to see i don't need to see it
[1:37:02] i i don't need to see the bomb drop to
[1:37:03] say he was right he was right he was no
[1:37:06] i don't need to see that
[1:37:08] i want to be in the air before one bomb
[1:37:10] strikes and say he was right he was
[1:37:11] right he was right
[1:37:13] [Applause]
[1:37:16] i want to follow the vision
[1:37:20] i've been convinced my heart has been
[1:37:22] persuaded it's right i want to follow
[1:37:25] the vision
[1:37:28] the messenger is gone
[1:37:30] but this message is still coming to pass
[1:37:34] let's buy our heads

[1:37:43] thank you for giving us eyes to see
[1:37:46] and here's the here
[1:37:50] lord i said some open things across this
[1:37:52] pulpit
[1:37:55] i didn't intend to be that forward when
[1:37:57] i came up here
[1:38:00] but i hadn't said anything that's not
[1:38:01] already out there on the internet
[1:38:04] this message has been sounded
[1:38:07] around the world
[1:38:09] around this nation
[1:38:11] the people know what it's about
[1:38:14] they know what we believe
[1:38:17] and god i'm on the acts of the night
[1:38:20] as your servant
[1:38:22] anoint us afresh
[1:38:26] may your holy spirit give us a new
[1:38:27] stirring

[1:38:32] but a spirit of grace and of a sound
[1:38:34] mind
[1:38:35] to know you ordained us to see these
[1:38:37] things
[1:38:38] and then to act accordingly
[1:38:41] when noah saw the rain he didn't panic
[1:38:44] he just got in the yard
[1:38:46] when the deaf angel was coming
[1:38:48] the real believers in panic they just
[1:38:50] applied the blood
[1:38:53] lord all we need to do now is find our
[1:38:55] place
[1:38:58] there was a going in or coming out
[1:39:00] but your prophet told us now is the time
[1:39:02] to go up

[1:39:49] alcohol in one night
[1:39:51] cigarettes in one night if he could do
[1:39:54] that
[1:39:55] he can deliver us from anything that we
[1:39:56] have in need of tonight

[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:40] we were saying down in mullins all the
[1:40:42] types and all the shatters
[1:40:45] and they're saying these visions
[1:40:49] that the prophet saw
[1:40:52] the seventh and so what would happen to
[1:40:54] america
[1:41:00] somebody
[1:41:02] over in ukraine they said when
[1:41:05] russia was mounting up around about
[1:41:07] ukraine they were saying that
[1:41:12] they didn't believe it
[1:41:14] the russian would do certain
[1:41:16] such a thing
[1:41:19] so the people stayed
[1:41:23] they wouldn't believe that russia would
[1:41:25] invade
[1:41:28] i don't believe america believed
[1:41:32] i don't believe
[1:41:34] many christians and bride
[1:41:39] so-called believe
[1:41:41] that it could happen anytime
[1:41:44] the bombs can fall
[1:41:48] it was said so clear tonight
[1:41:52] get your house in order
[1:41:56] be certain of god
[1:42:02] you know paul had to give accountant
[1:42:05] he said i've had sean declared to you
[1:42:07] the whole cancer of god
[1:42:11] each and every
[1:42:13] pastor have to give an account
[1:42:18] if he has to give account for you
[1:42:21] most people don't
[1:42:23] say
[1:42:24] i'm kind for myself
[1:42:29] you know it's difficult for pastors to
[1:42:32] stand and say i got to give a count for
[1:42:34] you
[1:42:38] the prophet said paul be there with his
[1:42:40] people
[1:42:42] in his age
[1:42:45] and all the pastors that heard paul
[1:42:47] timothy
[1:42:49] titus and all of them have to give
[1:42:51] account
[1:42:52] with those that they preached to
[1:42:56] they'll stand with their people
[1:42:58] their congregations
[1:43:00] and god will go to paul
[1:43:04] and paul has to answer to god for what
[1:43:06] he preached
[1:43:08] got to go to timothy tempting tammy to
[1:43:09] have to answer before god but what do
[1:43:11] you preach
[1:43:14] each pastor don't have to answer
[1:43:17] to god for what he preached
[1:43:21] then he gonna go to those
[1:43:23] ones that
[1:43:24] heard them preach
[1:43:26] so did you hear
[1:43:28] what did you do with the gospel that you
[1:43:30] heard
[1:43:32] i heard them
[1:43:34] but god i you told me to do something
[1:43:37] different from what he's
[1:43:40] you see what i'm saying
[1:43:42] they tried to get the prophet to say
[1:43:45] if the angel god told you something
[1:43:48] he said if an angel come from heaven
[1:43:50] tell me something different from what
[1:43:52] this bible say he said i'll let him be a
[1:43:54] curse
[1:44:00] you know somebody tried to convince you
[1:44:01] to say something different than what the
[1:44:03] bible say then let him be a curse
[1:44:06] but if the bible said it you should
[1:44:08] believe it
[1:44:11] are you with me
[1:44:13] i want you to understand that that's
[1:44:16] going to be

[1:44:24] i gotta give a count
[1:44:26] so sometimes when we're telling you and
[1:44:28] preaching to you
[1:44:30] it's because we know one day i'm gonna
[1:44:32] have to give a count
[1:44:35] that's why i don't want
[1:44:37] nobody blood on my hand
[1:44:40] no matter how hard you take it and oh
[1:44:43] brother see me uh-uh
[1:44:46] i gotta give a count to god

[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:45] as i said
[1:49:47] the other day when
[1:49:50] i was in mullins i i said again
[1:49:56] i was dying on my knees here
[1:49:59] and the lord's not
[1:50:01] speaking to me the world on on the edge
[1:50:05] on edge
[1:50:07] so went down to mullins and i'm
[1:50:09] screeching a little
[1:50:11] the world on edge
[1:50:14] next day i got an airport in atlanta
[1:50:19] saw the newspaper the headline
[1:50:22] the world on edge
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:28] said god
[1:50:31] i think he's telling us something he's
[1:50:33] telling us
[1:50:35] that we need to draw closer to him
[1:50:40] there's too many things that
[1:50:42] getting our attention away from god
[1:50:46] but none of this stuff's gonna matter
[1:50:48] after a while
[1:50:50] a lot of houses not land not gold not
[1:50:52] whatever
[1:50:55] whatever we searching or trying to
[1:50:57] achieve in this world it won't matter
[1:50:59] after a while
[1:51:04] it's whether or not you got jesus
[1:51:07] we're realizing that it doesn't matter
[1:51:10] what's being said or preached
[1:51:13] if you the elect of god something to
[1:51:15] tell you to get your house in order
[1:51:19] you hear that little small steel voice
[1:51:21] you hear something inside of you i gotta
[1:51:24] draw close
