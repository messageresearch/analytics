morning and those that are listening in certainly glad for this day that the Lord has made and it's New Year that God has blessed us to see another year we certainly appreciate the Lord doing that for us we know that the expectations you know must be high we not might not set low expectation we must expect God to do great things in our lives we must expect spiritual and naturally that God bless us in every way you know that if you don't set expectations you have nothing to work towards but we say to you that you ought to set goals and try to achieve the goals that God has put in your heart and pray God let me work towards something in this year 20 21 let me work towards my spiritual growth as well as my natural growth and let me oh evaluate let me evaluate constantly where I am spiritually Where I Am Naturally the goals that I set things that I want to achieve in [Music] God sometimes we we don't set a Mark we don't set a goal I believe that Paul he had expectations and he had a Mark that he was pressing towards and he knew that there was a m that he was looking forward to reaching that M I believe at the end of the road he realized that he had fought a good fight he had a course he had a race to run he had a course to run he said I finish my course you know knowing that your life has a a meaning knowing that your life has importance and purpose if you know that brother and sister as you Embark or as you look to 2021 let us oh go look to Jesus the Bible said Mark the perfect man as we look to those with high expectation see Paul said I I press towards the Mark or the prize of the what high you know I'm not see sometimes we we we're not setting our goals up high enough we becomeing comfortable and satisfied just with coming to church and just being a Christian just singing a song and just being here just paying your tithes and offering and and and just being faithful [Music] but it's a high calling that I'm pressing towards the mark of the prize of the high calling I want to I want to achieve more this year than last year sudden I talking to Rachel I said you know once you're in your position then you in a place where God can bless you see God can only bless Israel in the in their Homeland and God can only bless the bride in the word because they said if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you can ask what you will and I'll do it until you get in the word then you are missing out on your [Music] blessing if you come to your Homeland which is Christ which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost come to Christ and get in Christ then you have access to all spiritual blessings and all the blessings of heaven but to not to be on the outside of your blessings and expect the blessings that come to you on the outside of the promise but brother and sister we must come back to our position in Christ and our placing where the bride supposed to be in this age where the church is supposed to be for this particular time that we living in so there are standards that we must reach then you must know what God expecting for your life and what you are to achieve in this age and then once you know what the will of God for the brother for the church in this age then you must press towards the mark let me just read here in numbers 13 and we're talking this morning about taking a stand for you can look around and in the school on the job and in the community and even in family and you can see all the the chaos and all the stuff that is happening you can see people are out of position they're not living as Christians ought to live and they're not walking as chrisan ought to [Music] walk just because we say we a bride just because we say we're Christian that don't mean we are for our actions speak louder than our words like to greet the Saints and sup this morning and thank God for your tuning in and our brother Gavin sorry about your mother over in England but keep pressing the battle thank God that you're encouraged to keep pressing on the different ones oh God that's tuning in y'all thank you for tuning in let us bow our heads father we thank you for this stay that you made uh uh sister Jordine Smalls she's lying in the hospital there in chareston South Carolina bleeding from the brain but God you know Lord we know oh God that the family's going through a trying time right now for she's been the caker of her husband and father Lord we ask you to be merciful to her not only her my brother Rober that's in the hospital there something this daughter lying in the hospital here in Columbia Lord we pray for brother Robert and joshin this morning Father Lord we thank you for Jennifer and Flo and pan and Rosel family Lord and losing their father the Lord father we going through trying times right now trouble on every side but God help us to stand help us to fight the good fight of faith that we might lay hold on eternal life keep us strong in you Lord Lord forgive us sin Lord bless these that are here this morning and those that are listening in this morning father I pray that you give Faith there and something Lord our mother Dill it Lord and pray you continue to strengthen her and our mother English and mother English Lord father we pray for the Saints down God you keep them strong Lord hallelujah God Lord you're more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that which we ask so think Lord we thank you for the blood of Jesus that prevails pray prevails against all the works of the enemy Lord may you heal save and deliver set free by the power of the Holy Ghost give us what we need Lord hallelujah help us to stand in Jesus name amen the Book of Numbers 13 and 30 we thank God again for the word it reads and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we're not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they bought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the [Music] land through which we have gone to search it it is is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it were men of a great stature and there we saw the Giants Lord have mercy the son of an which come unto the of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in in their sight God bless you in this word you may be seated you know in their understanding they saw themselves as Grasshoppers and and they were speaking for the enemy and they said the enemy sees us the same way you know there are many obstacles in our lives and I'm talking about stand taking a stand there are situations and conditions that would cause us to give up it's easy to give up when they think all the odds against you some folks said why try I I I I've tried my best to live a Godly life but I got all odds against me I tried to go to church and I tried to live the best I could could but look like all the odds are stack against me and sometimes we don't know why the test when we tried to do our best we don't know why we have to go through certain things and sometimes we just give up on it maybe that's the way um Caleb and Joshua felt that after coming out God had given them the promised land but there were enemies that were in the land that God had given them and those enemies that was in that Land look like they were so great and so powerful that they thought they might as well not even tried you know what what happens when we don't try but there were I I I'm talking about when you got thousands upon thousands of people all around you they telling you what you can't do are you with me you might have all kind of reports the doctor's report you might look at every situation that's somewhat like job J amen looked at every condition lost his children lost his cattle lost everything he had on the sick bed and even his wife turn on him seem like somebody like that ought to you'll say ain't no you should figh no more I might as well give up and when you got the odds against you brother Joshua when you got almost two million people telling you what you can't do and what God but you got the word of the Lord and the word of the Lord say Amen the land is yours go and possess it ain't that right God Amen you know can you stand when adversities when things are all against you will you be able to take the word of God and say God I still believe you I trust you I I I'm going to take this stand for God regardless how bad it look how ter it look amen hallelujah see sometimes many times you know look like you're the Oddball sister AB in school look like you the Oddball you know all the little girls or whatever doing this and that and seem like you the Oddball maybe amen uh Moses you might feel a little out of place sometime you know I don't belong where do I belong are you with me sometimes we we we find ourselves in in in predicaments and amen and and look like why should I stand is nobody else standing you know the whole church is G haywire and look look like uh Joshua and Caleb could have took the attitude if if the whole whole congregation to two million people why should I stand why should I trust God when nobody else is trusting God they better looked around and look for somebody to encourage them but nobody wanted to encourage them they out 12 Spies and only two came back with a good report the rest of them came back and said we can't take it brothers and sisters don't be discouraged amen but you got to be fortified and know what the word of God said about it to you as an individual and once it been revealed to you that you can make it regardless oh oh Hallelujah regardless of what happened to you in the past a regardless of how the future may look to your eyes you must be able to say God word says with the stripes I'm Healed are you with me you know sometimes we can be in so much pain in our bodies that we could have to put the word on it and say God your word said I'm Healed anyhow your word say I'm Healed praise God if I die holding on to your word then I'm still healed are you with me so what else do I have I I can either suffer the pain the agony uh the sickness and the infirmity is it going to do me any good to give in amen but if I have faith in God's word then I know the word of God is the victory that overcometh the world see it's better to take a stand and hold on to that word you see what happens amen Joshua and Caleb perhaps they didn't see their Victory right then if pirate came 40 years later but amen they were able to go and do what they said and all those nay sales and all of those that said that what they couldn't do they weren't able to do it amen but I want you to be able to say I can do what I can do all things through Christ at what amen with his stripes I am healed amen God I'm going to trust you regardless of what Bealls and how many fail and how many amen fall to the way side God I'm going to take a stand because I know the word that you send in this hour is right are you with me I'm not I'm I'm not GNA doubt what Moses said Moses said that God said go and possess the land I'm going to take what Moses said amen praise God God said he would have a church without spot or without rank or without blemish or any such thing and that's what I'm expecting okay brother sister The Book of Revelation 3 I got to move praise God I'm not not going to be long the Lord's willing three and four and when it talks about sld mean Escape ones or whatever he says thou has a few names even in Sodom which have not defiled their garments amen somebody said the garments in the days of uh back then were long and sometimes they would hit the ground you know when you're walking so you got to be careful how you walk because you can get get dirt and everything in your garments while you're walking but you got to keep from uh your garment getting dirty and filthy you got to be careful how you walk that's why the Bible said walk in the spirit amen and you will not fulfill the what the lust of the flesh are you with me see you got to you got to in order to stay clean you got to walk in the spirit amen he said there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the Lord the spirit that's in Christ Jesus that made me free from the law of sin and death are you with me so I I don't have to feel condemned amen because I I'm walking in the spirit the devil could uh uh bring all accusations against hit you and say all kind of stuff to persecute you but you got to keep walking to keep your garments you got to stay clean brother and sister you got to stay clean he said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God Amen you got to keep your heart pure are you with me he said blessed in the man that walth not in the counsel of ungodly you can't sit in the seat of the con but your Delight got to be in the light of in the Lord amen and I'm going to tell you something when when when when a man ways please the Lord he make even your enemies be at peace with you amen when you delight yourself in the Lord he'll give you the desires of your heart amen the things that you have need of God want to give them to you but you got to say God Amen I believe you I take you you're my savior you're my Lord You're My all and all everything I need you God Lord I want you are you with me praise God and knowing that God got so many blessings in numerable amen that you don't even have room enough to receive God want to give you more than you want amen but by the grace of God he says here he says thou has a few names even in solders which have not defiled their garments God always got a Fai for few people he never leaves himself without a witness he always got somebody that will stand up for Jesus somebody that would take a stand for Jesus amen it might be a whole lot of folk won't stand but that's somebody that going to take a stand brother and sister will you be counted among that number that would take a stand for Jesus amen you can't look around because the numbers and odds against you and you might as well throw up your hand but will you take a stand for Jesus amen amen I tell you sometimes it's difficult because sometimes when you're standing you're standing all all by yourself but remember it's better to have amen the numbers and the odds against you to have God with you are you with me because you're standing and it look like you're standing by yourself but don't worry about a thing amen cuz God will never leave you and he will never forsake you you know it it it was it was very much because Joseph was a a dreamer and he he had dreams and you know he he had a prophetic gift inside of him and his brothers were jealous of him and his father loved him and a and because of that he was persecuted brother and sister when God bless you you're going to be persecuted your family and though they love you they don't understand you amen sometime your father and mother didn't understand Joseph and they thought Joseph something wrong with you you going to be exalted above mama daddy and all of oh Lord something wrong with this boy but you nevertheless Joseph couldn't do nothing with the gift that God had placed in him and brother and sister don't you know God has brought you to a place and a position that God would like to use you but you don't know amen that amen God using you you might have to go through some things to get where God can use you to be a blessing to your brother and your sister and to your family amen Joseph had to go through some stuff amen but God Amen he says thou shall walk before me in white for they are worthy amen he that over comth the same shall be clothed in white L remen and I will not lot his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels God he'll do things for you if you take a stand you know I thought about Overcomers it's not many people that are victorious in this age but there's a few there's a few a faithful few that amen that's going to take a stand and and and they'll be victorious amen he he said uh he shorten the days for the elect sake so there'll be a few that take a stand that those that are chosen in God before the foundation of the world and they will take a stand for God the rest of them brother and sister I'mma tell you something if God word ought to be worth you giving up this world and everything in it amen because you know the inside of the word of God that's where your blessings are and and you cannot beat God giving if you give God your best amen God will give you more than you ever could ever give him amen God will bless you in so many ways you don't even know where your blessing's coming from because you're willing to make a sacrifice amen for the word God I know your word will take care of me amen your word is a lamp unto my feet and light to my P God you'll take care of me Hallelujah so I'm not worried about amen as long as I abide in that word and long as I let God lead me and he'll keep me I'm going tell you something uh uh Genesis 50 uh it it looks a little uh uh tough sometimes but uh brother and sister in the midst of the odds that are against you I want you to know that God will bless you when All Odds Against you that's a that's the best time now how can uh all this that Joseph went through and how can God when your present distress the present things that you go through you can never see good in what you're going to sometimes you can hold up your hand say why mean why do I have to go through this why do I have to go through sickness why do I have to go through amen sometimes disappointed in marriage disappointed in family disappoint poting in dit why should I go through all of this other people seem to be you know going on but me why do I have to go through it but brothers and sisters I believe if Joseph would have thought about what he was going through amen it was something about him being a man of integrity a man that had you know that had God in her and knowing that God was with her regardless of what I'm going through and regardless of what I'm going through somehow amen I I'm not gonna give up on God and that's the way Joel was I'm not gonna give up on God I lost everything but I'm not going to lose you God Amen I'm not going to lose God I'm going to take a stand for God Amen my wife I you you say what you want you talk like one of the foolish women but that's all right I'mma hold on to God brother and sister you got to take a stand hold to God's unchanging hand regardless of how bad it look amen you might be going going down the Lonely Road of life and things ain't happening like you thought they would happen you praise God I'm saying things ain't happening like you want them to happen and things that you you expecting to happen but they it's not going to come in that way sometimes it might come amen around another angle for what you looking and expecting but it'll get down anyway if you keep your eyes on the prize seek you first the kingdom with God and his righteousness and all other things will be added God going to take care of business 15 and 20 Genesis 1520 he says but as for you Joseph Brothers was worrying about after Jacob died whether Joseph was going to take revenge on him for what they done to their brothers you see what I'm saying and how they sold him in the and gave him up are you with me you know Joseph had reached the place in Egypt that he was next to pharaoh and he had saved his brothers and his family but after the dad died they thought hey our brother going to turn on us now you can you see people treating you so bad yet there's no Envy no bitterness in your heart are you with me see what what happened and the Bible said in the 19th verse and Joseph said unto them fear not for I am in the place of God but as for you ye what you thought evil against me you see sometimes you you don't want to forgive those that thought evil against you you don't want to forgive uhuh I never forgive them Joseph said you thought evil against me I'm going to tell you something brothers and sisters the thing that people do to you and done to you in your life you can never get to the right place where God want you to be except you go down certain courses you know what it's like to hurt you know what it's like to have pain you know what it's like to suffer persecution you know what when you're right and somebody lied on you somebody oh are you with me see but once you go through it then How Sweet It Is to know that you've been through it and then you can have the right attitude of forgiveness you know it takes God to give you the attitude that you can forgive those that hurt you so bad done you so wrong Jo Joseph would have said I never would have had to go to prison I never but if he didn't go to prison he didn't go through the things he would never be in the position that he's in now it's a lot of things that I had to go through in life and sitting down and you know talking uh Rachel last night and I was telling some things but I would have never been able to enjoy I think Joseph probably had a a wonderful time with his Brethren you know I'm saying Lord y'all might have thought it y'all was doing me wrong but it was a blessing and brothers don't worry about a thing God meant it for good don't you know sometimes your purpose might not be understandable by you you may not understand your purpose Pur amen but God work all things to the good to them that love the Lord to them who are the call according to his what it might not work according to what your purpose but it's the purpose of God what God Amen God knew amen that in order for you to hold and maintain your position that you had to go down a certain Road and God allows you to go down a certain road to put you in your place in your position amen and that's what it's all about brother and sisters Joseph stood for God and God stood for Joseph and Joseph had the right kind of personality that he could forgive us look at what they did to Jesus he came into his own and his own received him not they spit in his face he could have gave up I mean he got to call 12 leion angels and they coming there Amen to to take him and kill them he said father if it possible let this cup pass nevertheless not my will but let your will be done God how many of us when AR are against you folks coming to Amen to take your life coming to Amen to do all kind of evil everything against you and you getting all bent out of proportion mad upset let them try Jesus knew what they were coming to do he said friend persuade me with a kiss amen sometime how how do we look in the midst of our adversities in the midst of the things that we go through how do you look when somebody's scheming on the job trying to make you look bad and maybe trying to get you fired are you with me how do you look when the professor wanted to amen blackball you and give you something bad when you know they deserve better are you with me life is not always is the way you want it to be but if you hold fast you'll see where God Amen going to work it to your good amen God might work it out amen that you didn't understand why it had to go that way but God wanted to amen build some character in you God going to take you to Higher Ground amen God going to restore amen even everything the devil thought he took from you Hallelujah I will restor said the Lord all the years that the canor the pal Locus and caterpillar eat I'm going to restore you back hallelujah amen job they took your children they took your cattle they took everything but don't worry about a thing I'm going to restore hallelujah amen because you stood for me I'm going to stand for you at the end praise God you're going to see it work to your good J you went through at part house you went through amen when they sold you but thank be to God look where you are now come on somebody look where you are now brother and sister amen look what God has done for you he bless you everywhere oh somebody said count your blessings count your many blessings see what God has done brother and sister amen you got we more than you ever had they me the devil try to take everything from you but he couldn't take you your faith from you your love for God Amen the devil couldn't take that God is good amen stand stand God will keep you in the midst of it all I said I'm leaving room for Ernest to finish I thought we'd do double hitter so he's going you enjoy the word this morning amen God is good amen Lord taking a stand amen I thought about it as he was ministering how when the Lord first saved me and how many times and I can look back and say I had to take a stand amen take a stand against family take a stand against friends and all it it wasn't wasn't an easy Road it was a lonely road sometimes but nevertheless God saw me through it amen and I can look at where I was and look at where I am now somebody said that that I might not be where I want to be but I or I might not be what I want to be or supposed to be but I ain't what I used to be amen because God is his his brought us a mighty long way and we thank the Lord for that you know I thought about the testimonies this morning and how you know when the Lord first saved me and how you know I was on a job and you know he's blessing you on the job and they wanted to elevate you you know at an early age and make you supervisor but the only problem was that they was going to put me on another shift and I would have to miss all my church services during the week so you know sometimes we look at things and say oh that's a blessing come on but I always said to myself I said Lord you mean more to me than anything you know I made a promise to the Lord when I was at my lowest place I said Lord if you if you get me from where I am right now I said God I remember in a Motel 6 praying one morning I said Lord if you help me if you get me from where I am right now I said Lord I'll to the best of my ability I'll serve you all the days of my life I said and I won't turn I won't turn around I said now I know it ain't going to be easy God I said but if you help me I said I won't go back and I always remembered that so what happens you know a lot of times the Lord start blessing you and the devil try to throw things all in your way to try to deter you come on but I always remember I always remember where God brought me from and I said Lord if you hadn't stepped in at my lowest place if you hadn't to stepped in just when I needed you the most God I wouldn't even be here today so no no matter what the devil got to offer no matter what the world got to offer Lord you mean more to me than anything because the devil LED you out there on the ledge and he left you out there come on left you out there to die he brought you out there to a place and he left you out there come on Soul on the way going to hell but I like that how they says when Jesus found me come on and wrapped his loving arms around me come on I think about when nothing else could help Love Lifted Me come on whenever everything else fell Love Lifted Me and I thought about that I said you know I was on the job and they they want you to be supervisor and all it's some years back and wanted you to miss church and I said you know I says I I says I can't do it I said said you going to turn this money down I says I got to be in the church and they asked me they said well well what's going on on Tuesdays and Friday nights where you got to be there I said I just got to be there there nothing I I said I just got to be there to hear the word of of the Lord I just got to be in that presence you know and they call me called the the operations manager and all that that they said earners we we need you to work not what would it take you know and I I said I I can't it's not that I'm not sacrificing come on sometimes you know the devil will offer you this come on it's a tradeoff if you do this like like he told Jesus if you Bow Down and Worship me I give you all this come on if you do this I'll do this right here come on trade off I want to say the devil can't give you nothing come on without something in return that he want and that something in return might cost you your soul how many believe that this morning but you know what I'm saying uh sitting there and uh you know they begin to say they they tell me they says you know we like they going to threaten to fire you if you don't take the position and they said you know God know you need a job that's what they told me and I said God gave me this job and he'll give me another one is what I told him they said oh okay and they say like they threaten to fire you so they tell you can leave I got up to walk out the office and they say you know they told me they say hey Ernest come on back in here they say close the door they say I tell you what we going to do we really need you to work this this other shift they say what time your church service start and I told them and they said all right well what we'll do when church service time come you can go into church and just come back after church and they said what what we want you to do don't even worry about clocking out we're going to pay you to go to church now you tell me when you take a stand for God come on what won't God do for you you know I said that's my testimony this whole Christian journey is built on what taking stands come on you know when you think that the trial is over come on you got something else God got something else in store for you but nevertheless the way you stood the first time you just keep standing for God and watch what God do you know this morning I thank the Lord for being here this morning and I know we had uh even today at work you know it was mandatory I was telling the the pastor the other day it was mandatory that we all had to be there this week and I was saying you know I didn't even know whether I was going to be able to go to sh mandatory ball inspection everybody's got to be there I said you know I said they've been working with me so much I said that I hate to to to just just you know every now and then you know sometimes you might have to be in is what I said come on but nevertheless I was telling them the other day I said the boss came up to me just out of the blue and he said Ernest he said I know you like to go to church said I know you like to be in God's house he said and I don't mind that he said I don't mind that he said I tell you what we can do he said we everybody got to be here but you can just go on go to church that what he said and just come in just come in after church and make your time up do however he said I don't mind that he said matter of fact if we get a lot of work done he said then you won't even have to come in Sunday he says but I'm I'm going to do that he said cuz I know and that's the thing about it you know uh uh people are watching you come on people a lot of people profess Christianity and profess to be saved but people are watching your life they're watching what you doing they watching what they coming out your mouth something coming out your mouth but they seeing something else in your life and they can't respect that come on but when they see that you you are real come on that you you standing for God and you not not just on Sunday but come on on Monday and Tuesdays and Wednesday you a Christian every day come on there respect that Hallelujah and God will do something great for you how many believe that this morning you know I was going to minister today uh by the grace of God I was going to minister on moving on come on I was going to minister on moving on and I says that you know I was going to you know I won't even get go in uh to the to the scripture but I says that you know it's hard sometimes moving on when we come to Crossroads in life you a lot of time times we hit those Crossroads you know and and God what he's wanting to do he's wan to elevate you he's wanting to take you to another place and sometimes we so tied to the past or we so tied to the things that are behind us that when God wants to take us and move us forward it's hard for us to move on but I was reminded how you know at the Red Sea you know uh God told Israel you know Moses speaking to him he says that the Egyptians you see today he said after this day you won't see them no more ever again he said God is going to fight for you he said I want you to speak to the children I want you to tell them to move forward come on I want you to go on come on and from that day you know when God took care of their enemies they were supposed to move on they were supposed to forget you know their troubles that was behind them and move on with God but the problem was that even though they moved on physically physically their hearts were still back there though they moved on with their bodies and they they took all their possessions and all that their minds were still in bondage their hearts were still stuck back there in the past they they they physically what we'll say moved on but yet they were still in bondage in their Spirit come on but I said today God when he what when the one that God sets free he's free indeed he don't want you just to move uh physically and just have a physical change but God wants to do something down on the inside come on that's why he told Nicodemus you must be born again reason why you can't understand my speech because you got to be converted Hallelujah where all things have become new the things that you are uh you at your Crossroad now I come to deliver you not just to make you look good on the outside but I want to do something on the inside that there after this day you don't have to worry about them no more Hallelujah a trans a transformation has to take place we find that I said come on we got to move on we find that the children of Israel in Egypt I mean I mean in the wilderness they never moved on come on because every time something happened they says oh how good we had it in Egypt how good we had it back there come on and they said you should have left us back there come on but God you know wanted them to move on from that come on Hallelujah and that's what we do I said sometimes we get caught up and will we find ourselves looking back Hallelujah and if you don't watch it the devil have you saying that these were the good old days come on those were the good old days hallelujah the good old days when you were in bondage some was bound to alcohol some was bound to drugs some was bound to prostitution the devil had you beat up shaking you couldn't even hold your head up in the house of God come on but you look back and the devil will trick you and say that those were the good old days hallelujah no the good days started when God came by Hallelujah and begin to speak the word hallelujah Satan let my people go let them go off of alcohol let them go off of drugs and lying and cheating Satan Let My People Go Hallelujah and the devil had no other chice but let you go that's when the good old days started that's when the Revival started down in your soul when you can come in the house of God and you Wen shamed to scream out Hallelujah you wern't shamed to scream out thank you Jesus you weren't ashamed to call on that name Hallelujah no matter what the world was saying about you you was free come on I said we got to move on Hallelujah I think about that I says what it is a a a birth has to take place come on a transformation the the to kill all those lustly desires all those worldly things that's in you and take it away come on you have no remembrance for those things the things that had you bound I like that sing that song God has delivered me why should I be bound Hallelujah you can be free to worship God you can be free to go and serve the Lord come on you don't have to be ashamed to lift your hands Hallelujah you because you know what God has done for you you know where God has brought you from you know if it wasn't for him you might be dead this morning you might be locked up in jail you might be in the middle institution if it wasn't for God hallelujah oh I you know my favorite saying is but God hallelujah who was rich in Mercy oh I don't know about you but God had mercy on me Hallelujah and I thank him every day see I get excited amen it's something down on the inside it just go to bubbling Hallelujah just go to stirring up down on the inside it brings tears to your eyes it brings joy in your heart to know what God has done for you cuz everybody else turned on you come on everybody else walked away from you nobody else couldn't help you but God God helped you how many experienced that this morning oh we thank the Lord I says come on taking a stand come on I said I was going to minister on moving on come on you got to move on from here like they said we can pass this mountain long enough you got to move on not just with the natural bodies but spiritually let God do something in your life and what is it going to take it's going to take the baptism of the Holy Ghost something changing you that's what it is more than just a natural like he was saying this morning about just coming to church and and and being uh a good a faithful person paying your tithes but your expectations got to be high I said Lord you know I was praying the other day I said God I'm looking for Vindication come on not just to say that vindicate me cuz you you so you can show yourself as a powerful man no but God I'm looking for Vindication of your word because God this is what you promis Lord you promis God and we're at a we're at a Needy Time come on we're at a time where we need God to be God we're at a time where we need a healer come on where we need a deliverer where we need a savior not that we want but we need God why because the do the the medical world they doing the best that they can oh Hallelujah now we need God Hallelujah the econ economic system economic system is doing the best they can but we need God right now come on sometimes I was telling the other day I said Lord especially on the ministry it's a weight on the ministry because we doing the best we can with the situation that's at hand and it hurts your heart sometime because you you say you limited feel like to what you can do God we want to do more we need your leadership we need your wisdom we need your guidance Lord what can we do Lord to help the people hallelujah you know the Lord said you can get down on your knees and pray more hallelujah hallelujah you might be restricted in movement but nothing can restrict the Holy Ghost nothing can restrict the spirit of God from going to that hospital bed from going from house to house and still doing the things that he always done nothing can restrict the movement of God hallelujah I said what can we do more he said you can get down on your knees and pray more I'm still that same God hallelujah God is still delivering how many believe that this morning come on I said we moving on Hallelujah think about your Crossroad think about you know where you are even now and say Lord I'm moving on I'm moving on with you God I'm leaving forgetting those things that are behind come on he says forgetting those things that are behind I'm pressing towards the I'm forgetting all about who done me wrong who said this about me and who who didn't help you and who come on I'm forgetting all those things that are behind and I'm pressing on towards the mark come on on I'm moving on from here I'm I'm releasing it that's what it is you got to learn as an individual how to release things to God come on don't carry them around but release them to the Lord take those weights that you got on release them to God God I'm laying them right here at the cross I'm laying them right here at your feet God you said to cast all my cares upon you because you cared for me Lord I'm laying it down right here Lord hallelujah and I'm going on with Jesus oh I'm taking up my cross and I'm following him you got to learn how to release it I tell you you'll sleep better at night when you learn how to release things come on you'll start feeling better when you learn how to release things your health will get better everything will get better when you learn how to release it come on God I'm putting it in your hands I believe Joseph found out how to release it oh my brother sold me I got lied on I'm in the prison oh why me Lord sometimes but I believe Joseph knew how to release it Hallelujah he came came to an understanding within himself that y'all didn't do it it was God the whole time Hallelujah and that's why I can be where I am today because of what God has done oh Jesus ain't you thankful today I said I'm thankful Hallelujah I'm thankful I always quote that I I says thank God for the mountains and The Valleys come on and all the things that I've been through come on because if I never had a problem I wouldn't know that God could solve them come on I wouldn't know what faith in God can do Hallelujah but through it all come on through it all he said I learn to depend on Jesus through it all come on I learned trust in God hallelujah can you say that this morning that through it all you learned you didn't always know how but you learned Hallelujah you didn't know how but God taught you how many believe that this morning thank the Lord how many appreciate the word of God this morning Amen Let Us stand God is so good amen like he says this morning take a stand come on take a stand a lot of times that stand you know is in the scriptures how he says that you know the one that ate bread with him had sat at his table and ate bread with him was the same one that lifted up the hill against him you know a lot of times uh enemies don't come with from without they come from within we might as well be real the ones that the devil will try you with the closest ones to you he'll try you with brother and sister Mom and Daddy all those things the devil the Lord does those things sometime to see if you going to let anything separate you from the love of God come on and I say don't hold it against them but remember it's something for you God is trying to take take you somewhere come on but nevertheless I was sharing with someone the other day and I say this before we pray I was sharing someone the other day I says the main objective is to make Heaven our home I says if situations don't work out don't you let nothing separate you from God don't you let nothing stop you from loving God don't you let nothing stop you from being a Christian from being faithful I said no matter how things turn out it might shake you a little bit I says but then you you get back back up and you stand because the objective you don't want to let nothing separate you from God I don't care what it is I don't care what come in this life situation might not work out the way you think it's going to work out but the main objective I got to make Heaven my home I got to hear him say Well done I got to get in the Kingdom uh uh uh mother and father forsake you come on God Will Take Me Up Hallelujah brother and sister walk away friends walk away in family sometimes even the church members will talk about you and say all kind of things about you but nevertheless you got to have one objective God I'm going to stay in love I'm going to stay with you God because you mean more than anything that's got to be your goal that's got to be in your heart like it say it's in my heart it's got to be in your heart Hallelujah let us bow Lord we want to say thank you this morning thank you for your word God as went forth oh God Lord we love you with all our hearts God you're all that we know Lord

can lift your hands wherever you are this morning and say Lord I want to stand God I want to stand against all ODS the world is against me but God I want to stand give me the strength to stand give me the strength to look these things in the eyes and move on Hallelujah I believe the Lord to do it for you thank you thank you for the hands Lord the hearts that was lifted and raised this morning God I
