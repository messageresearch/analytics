my former Pastor brother Brady you know he would have been so delighted these days to travel some more and to share the word of God but you know I can see him going down and um he's not able to even

uh brother beruti from the Congo then my precious friend brother wte from Ghana has gone and um Brother Art Frank in Germany and just different ones crossing over you know um very soon we will never be able to listen to somebody who was there in the meetings and seeing the mighty move of God amen so but God is raising up another generation who who are not there 1963 or to be in the meetings but we are the recipient of the word of God Amen and I thank God we can still raise that flag amen that God has send a voice in this day amen and we are echo of that voice that we've heard from eleazer amen and we're preaching it onto Hallelujah the going away of the Rapture amen praise God may God grant us Grace in this hour Amen to stand upon the unfailing word of almighty God Amen to seek out until the last one comes in and I thank God that we can have meetings like this where we it's not just that we quote quotes but we we preach a gospel of Deliverance amen because so many times even around the message of the hour we' have settled down and we need to hear a Word of Deliverance uh amen people are bound in the message but they are bound amen by demons and circumstances uh and they are still held in religious captivity amen but I thank God that Jesus uh he came to set the captive free amen praise God hallelujah and so if you stand on your feet we like to go to the word of God Amen I'd like to read from the book of Exodus chapter 6 then I'll read from Acts chapter 3 and I'd like to for a while as we share together the word of God I'd like to preach on redemption's Jubilee Hallelujah you you know uh Redemption to secure the release it is recovery of a person or thing Hallelujah by the payment of a price and we want to thank God for the price that has been paid for our Redemption the blood of Jesus Christ amen never forget that the blood of Christ and so as we find that scripture may we just bow our heads everywhere our gracious God and Father Lord we thank you God that once more we can report for Duty Heavenly Father we pray oh God that you'd help us to move ourself out of the way that Lord God you be glorified behind skin One More Time Lord we come not to project ourselves or Lord where we're from but Lord God we know that there was a word that is prepared before the foundation of the world and there's a people to receive that word Heavenly Father we pray this evening oh God that Lord God somebody who is so sick Lord God somebody seeking Deliverance somebody seeking salvation oh God the peace of God in their lives uh Lord God that we pray that the word would rescue the perishing and care for the dying and would snatch in pity this evening Lord God we pray that oh God you might come down on the scene in your Shak glory and may the Holy Ghost and Fire move among your children oh God lord Jesus that we might know that the king of the Covenant is in the camp bless us Lord as we look to you and believe in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen in Exodus chapter 6 and let me just read from verse one then the Lord said unto Moses now shall thou see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hands will I let them go and with a strong hand shall I shall he drive them out of his land and God spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the Lord and I I appeared unto Abraham and to Isaac and unto Jacob by my name almighty God but by my name Jehovah was I not known now every time that God is going to do a new thing he has a name for what he's going to do Hallelujah and I will also establish my Covenant with them and will give them the land of Canaan and the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were a stranger and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage and I have remember my Covenant wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burden of the Egyptians and I will rid you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stretch out arm and with a great judgment and I will take you to me for a people and I will be to you a God and he shall be and he shall know that I am the Lord your God which brought you out of under the bondage of the Egyptians and I will bring you into a land concerning which I swear turn to to give it to Abram and to Isaac and to Jacob and I will give it to you for an Heritage I am the Lord then over in the book of Acts chapter 3 and verse 19 I just love that scripture it says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sin may be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until the time of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world begin may the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated amen you know we speak of that two word Redemption and Jubilee now Redemption we're always talking about to buy back amen and I tell you I remember I was down in Ghana and I went to they took me to the cape coast and as a black person I'm identified with my people and I've seen the dungeons of Amen the slaves where they held the captives there in Ghana amen and I you know I was told out there would held them their captive their their only course was to take that ship Amen to the West amen I could see at the top of the dungeon they they had the Church of England because the the English men that went to Ghana am me to take captives to the West they they didn't bring their wives uh they brought their religion with them hallelujah amen and I could amen reflect that amen black Africa and I'm identified with my forefathers amen I could REM I could think how they would have amen suffered in that dungeon amen their only cause was amen that ship and to reach the West uh amen and their way was slavery amen I've looked uh amen at the shackles and the chain uh amen that they held them with uh amen and you know people said let us leave that and let us move on but Israel as a na ation amen has never forget uh amen the things that they brought through and I will never forget uh amen how I came here to the West amen but I think of a greater emancipation Amen in 19 Hallelujah in 1838 uh amen when emancipation was declared in the west uh amen people could have dropped uh amen their instrument of work uh and they could have walked away from their slave master amen they were free amen what a freedom that was for them amen but I thank God tonight uh amen that there is a great of Freedom amen there is a freedom from sin there's a freedom from bondage uh amen of the Egyptians of Babylon uh amen there's a freedom tonight uh where the Bible declare it who the sun set free is free inde indeed Hallelujah we would like to look at the price of our Redemption what Redemption really means you know it was there in Israel amen that there were once a year where they would take a sensus of all the males that were there and everybody that was counted amen as the Bible said uh amen that you die not uh you were to pay off shackle and if the man was rich the price was half a shekele if he was poor the price was the same uh Hallelujah it doesn't matter who he was uh amen the price uh hallelujah amen for his release was the same uh amen and when I think of that uh amen it brings me back to the blood uh amen of Jesus Christ uh amen that was shed upon Mount Calvary amen I want to tell you tonight uh it doesn't matter who you are whether you're rich or you're poor uh whether you're white or you're black uh whether you're Indian or Chinese the price of redemption is the same hallelujah amen your price is not different from mine and my price is not different from yours uh amen but he paid the price uh once and for all and Redemption was over Hallelujah glory to God Amen yes sir amen here it was in the Old Testament and in The Exodus uh amen how God tell them they were under the bondage of pharaoh for 400 years uh amen but that time of captivity was coming to an end uh amen God begin to tell them I am the Lord hallelujah amen I unto Abram uh and to Isaac uh and to Jacob uh by my name almighty God uh but by name Jehova was I not known in other words God's was going to saying I'm going to show you amen that I'm not just the AL Mighty God uh but I'm a god Jehovah a god with his family Hallelujah and I'm going to take them by a mighty hand uh I'm going to release them out of bondage uh I am the Lord Lord uh hallelujah amen that's a reflection uh of you and that tonight uh it doesn't matter what hold you amen he's the same God tonight uh like he was back then uh and it doesn't matter what method uh amen that sat also hold you am me God said uh I'm going to redeem you I'm going to release you I'm going to take you out from the bondage amen glory to God now God made a law of redemption and The God Who We Serve he's a God that made an holy law amen and he himself uh is not Exempted from that law what a mighty God we serve what a mighty God we serve hallelujah amen and God Amen making that law of redemption amen he he include him self uh and in that law of redemption uh whosoever will now in Redemption there were three things uh that a redeemer had to do amen when he paid the price of redemption knowing that law of redemption whoever is going to redeem another he's got to be a near Kinsman he could not be a stranger he had to be of the same kind same area are you there with me hallelujah amen there were three things he had to do amen the first uh he had to Hallelujah redeem uh The Inheritance now here it is uh amen a man was Hallelujah poor he had no possession amen and might be his children were going to take and captive uh now he can give all that he have uh Hallelujah when he give all that he have uh he give himself uh in the ransom with his possession now when the Redeemer comes along uh Hallelujah he purchase back uh The profited Inheritance uh hallelujah amen the property had to be bought back uh amen that was pledge uh am and that was a work of Bas to Naomi in order that he might get ru uh redeem the land uh hallelujah amen it's a type of Christ uh Hallelujah otherwise the land uh would have been held uh in poverish uh Hallelujah until the time uh Hallelujah of the Jubilee for in the Jubilee If any man was taken captive he could serve his time but God made a Year of Jubilee where it doesn't matter how long you are held for when that Jubilee here was declared it doesn't matter Hallelujah you could drop your instrument uh Hallelujah can walk out uh and you could go free but yet that freedom uh was for whoever will you had to want it amen cuz men were satisfied with his capture and he didn't want to go free they said they had to take him down to the Tabernacle and take an hoore from the fire and Pierce his ears he might live to another Jubilee but he will never go free aren't you glad tonight uh when God declare that Jubilee Hallelujah by the blood of Christ uh you step out of sin uh you step out of disgrace uh you step out of bondage uh and you have walked free uh and the Bible declare itth who the sun set free is free indeed Hallelujah he released The Inheritance the land but then he had to release the Kinsman yeah now the Kinsman is like a brother a first cousin Hallelujah he was related to him and he had to be the nearest of Kinsmen a father and cousin wouldn't be able to do it if there was a nearer one Hallelujah so when he released uh Hallelujah The Inheritance uh then he came now to release uh Hallelujah the Kinsman now Christ become Our Redeemer he takes death uh for everyone in Adam's Fallen race aren't you glad for that uh saving us uh Hallelujah from this inheritance forever Hallelujah the full restoration uh of our inheritance uh hallelujah amen can now be achieved is a r amen neither the church Church neither sin neither the world can hold you if you want to go free who the son set free is free indeed hallelujah amen then thirdly he must now avenge hallelujah amen the blood of his Kinsman so he redeemed The Inheritance he red his Kinsman and he Avenged his blood now you and I know that we have all been captive by Satan the Bible say we were born in sin shamed in iniquity we came into the world uh speaking lies uh you don't have to teach a baby to be lying Hallelujah a child would lie because it's born of Adam's Fallen race he a amen but God has made a way is a right and in that way that God made uh he did not just Pat Satan on the back he did not just hold his hand uh Hallelujah in unity amen when Jesus came uh he destroyed the work of the enemy Hallelujah to set you free he's a ro amen I tell you how you might of being a prostitute uh you might be bound by drugs uh you might be bound by women uh Hallelujah I don't care what bind you amen Jesus Christ come uh to se uh the captive free hallelujah amen Our Redeemer through death destroy Satan do you believe he's destroyed Hallelujah but our minds are hell captive now I'd like to say it like this amen many people were released in the emancipation of slavery but their minds were still there captive and so though they were free to go amen they come become comfortable in the life that they were living and they would not walk away hallelujah amen but Christ has done something uh for you and I when Christ redeem you he give you the power of the Holy Ghost uh with fire can somebody say fire fire it gives you the Holy Ghost uh and fire is the RO uh amen it transform your nature amen I tell you you're not the same uh that you were yesterday uh hallah Christ has redeemed you by the blood Hallelujah he set you free uh amen I tell you tonight uh you might be the violence of Sinner but by the blood of Christ uh you don't have to live uh in sin uh one minute longer for Jesus uh the great emancipator he pay the price and he set you free Hallelujah in that Redemption the blood of Christ Hallelujah it speak for what you did Hallelujah the blood cover the blood cover and I want to tell you tonight when the blood cover you it cover everything Jesus stayed there on Mount Calvary Hallelujah and that our that he spent there on the cros uh amen shedding his blood uh is that every sin that you can commit uh every sin that you

you are sick we've got to heal you know in 2022 when I came to this meeting before I came to South Carolina I stopped with friends in North Carolina and there was a sister for years she struggled with kidney failure and when I look at this young young couple and the struggles for 9 hours per day she had to be on this machine to purify her blood because her kidneys never work I sit around that table and my pearls were with my tears as I got broken when I look at my own children and look at their lives and see what the devil was bringing them through you know last year when I came one week before I got here she had one kidney transplant and so when I came last year one week before I reached he had that transplant and the doctors were telling her the work of that one kidney was more than two kidneys if she had them and so in the first week of this month they had a celebration and they invited me to come and to celebrate what God has done for their lives you know I I was I I I was trying to be there but we had the hurricane come by way and knock out our power or water system I had to stay to take care of the farm I I I could not be there with them to celebrate but I say this one thing it doesn't matter what the devil creat create God is a mighty healer you have not because you ask not because when you ask you ask wavering but I believe tonight that if we've got a need and we bring it to Jesus Christ The God Who We Serve is able to deliver my sister if you'd sing something for us tonight and if you've got a need you can come the emancipator is here the Lord Jesus and he's here to deliver you it might be [Music] sickness it might be burdens that you're carrying in your life God knows exactly where you live for a young person you said I just don't know what my tomorrow may
