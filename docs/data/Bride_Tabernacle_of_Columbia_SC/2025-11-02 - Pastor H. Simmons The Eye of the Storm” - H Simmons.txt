So many things that we were dealing with, but I had come back thinking about stepping into your glorified body. Praise God. Because there is a body. the prophet of God, he was saying in question that is right here now. Praise God. It's right here now. Praise God. Here in 36. And when they had sent, excuse me, when and when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat unto enter the ship, so that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow. And they awake him and said unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? And he arose and rebuked the winds and said into the sea, what &gt;&gt; peace be still. &gt;&gt; And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. And he said unto them, Why are ye what? fearful. &gt;&gt; How is it that ye have what? &gt;&gt; No faith. &gt;&gt; And they feared exceedingly and said one to another, what &gt;&gt; manner is &gt;&gt; that even the winds in the sea obey him. God bless you in his word. You may be seated. Want to talk this morning a little bit about the eye of the storm. The eye of the storm. Looking at the news a little bit and I saw that they were talking about the eye of the storm. So, I thought I'll just talk to you about the eye of the storm. The eye of the storm literally means the calm, the clear center of the hurricane. Praise God. I I believe the not a natural storm, a natural hurricane, but I believe that there's a spiritual storm that is hidden. &gt;&gt; There's an econom economical storm. &gt;&gt; People are losing their jobs left and right. Some folks are panicking because of the things that are happening concerning uh the food stamps and situations. So, we're in a a crisis. [snorts] Folks don't know what's going to happen next. Amen. It says the center of the hurricane figuratively it describes a person or situation at the center of a cha audit or a controversial even event. who remains calm and composed. [snorts] A chaotic uh controversial event and remaining calm and composed. I tried to say, "Oh, no, no, get away from it." But I felt like God, you're saying to somebody that's going through a storm right now. Things could be out of catered or [screaming] chaotic like how you handling your storm. &gt;&gt; Are you remaining calm and composed? He says it can also refer to a period of temporary calm in the midst of turbulent times. Temporarily calm in the midst of turbulent times. Praise God. the advice to those that were in the hurricane. When uh I or the storm came on the land, they said it bought about 175 miles an hour winds. We realize that the winds surround the hurricane and in the eye when it comes ashore there's a calm like the storm is over. It's it seem like the storm is over. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO people when they think it's all over then they go back to norm and storms come in life and when you believe that it's all over then we go back to norm but they are warning the people don't because it's just the eye of the storm &gt;&gt; AND DON'T GO BACK TO NORMAL NOW. THIS IS JUST THE EYE OF IT. THIS IS JUST AMEN. A PARTIAL AMEN. CALM RIGHT NOW. JUST A temporary calmness. &gt;&gt; THE STORM IS STILL RAGING. YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; YOUR SITUATION AND YOUR LIFE STORM. &gt;&gt; YOUR CRISIS [screaming] AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT OVER YET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD, AMEN. IS SAYING, AMEN. DON'T [screaming] GO BACK TO YOUR NORM RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Jesus said, "If you abide in me and my word abide in you, I'm saying stay inside." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Keep Amen. YOURSELF IN [screaming] UH OUT OF HARM'S WAY BECAUSE IT AIN'T OVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; People seek for SHELTER IN A PLACE OF SECURITY. AMEN. THE UH PLACE THAT THEY CAN HIDE from the stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or they feel safe. Me being over in Jamaica and so forth, some of the people lived in places that couldn't survive the storm. So they had to go to places uh uh that they provided where they can be more amended or secure. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We can go to the rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN ALL UNDERGROUND IS SAFE AND SAY, "I CAN [screaming] GO TO THE ROCK." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHERE I CAN BE SAFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN.

Oh, you ain't got it. &gt;&gt; But not long after, there arose against it a temperous wind called Eurocaidon. And when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive. and running under a certain island which is called Clada. We had much work to come by the boat which when they had taken up they used helps undergurting the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quick sands straight sail and we were driven and [snorts] we were exceedingly tossed with the tempest. The next day they lightened the ship and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. See, they done took off when Paul told them not to take off and told him you're going to be in danger and you know they they they went on you know you can read 27 they take it off and when trouble come you know you know what happens when God done told you and trouble come &gt;&gt; are you with me? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. God is God God can help you even in time of trouble. &gt;&gt; Even when you've been disobedient, God still can help you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away. But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said, "Sers, ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from cit and to have gained this harm in loss. [snorts] And now I exhort you to be of good cheer. For there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. For there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve, saying, "Fear not, Paul. There must be brought before Caesar. Thou must be brought before Caesar. And lo, God had given them all thee, all them that sail with thee. Wherefore, sers, be of good cheer, for I believe, for I believe God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe God? &gt;&gt; Be of good cheer then. &gt;&gt; That it shall be, even as it was told me, how be it, we must cast upon a certain island. But when the 14th night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight, the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country, and sounded and founded 20 fathoms. And when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and founded 15 fathoms. Then, fearing least we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wish for the day. And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea uh under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the force ship, Paul said to the centurion, to the soldiers, "Except thee abide in the ship." &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you something. Except you abide in the ship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, sometimes people want to leave the ship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to leave the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't know if you leave it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you leave the word, what do you say is going to happen? &gt;&gt; Ye cannot be saved. &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; He said, abide &gt;&gt; in the ship. &gt;&gt; If you leave, you can't be saved. You know, sometimes you preaching and you given a prophetic word. You're giving a prophetic word to somebody. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you feel like, hey, I know God is talking to somebody. &gt;&gt; It was it was meant that you speak this word when I tried to get around it, but you given a prophetic word. &gt;&gt; And when you give a prophetic word, you know God is talking to somebody. It's just not that you just all of a sudden you're going to speak this sermon, but you're giving a prophetic word to somebody. God is forewarning somebody. &gt;&gt; He's telling you, "Abide in the ship." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't stay in the ship, you can't be saved. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I don't care how many pulls the devil is pulling on you. I don't care how the wind and t look like the ship's falling apart, but the ship is where you need to be. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. You said, "Well, the ship falling apart. Every every time I fear from my life, [clears throat] &gt;&gt; except you abide in the ship." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay in Christ. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, stay in Christ. &gt;&gt; Stay in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't stay in the word, you can't be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let us stand. Hallelujah. I said, "God, why I got to come back here?" Cuz you're talking to somebody. Somebody has to hear this. So, I had to say, "Well, if you got to hear this, then I'm saying I need to speak." Even though I felt like speaking on the glorified body that's right here right now, waiting to be charged by the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Father in the name of Jesus Christ, I don't know Lord God that what's said that would mean something to somebody here this morning.
