[41:21] before the son of man
[41:24] amen
[41:25] tonight i
[41:27] want to
[41:30] use for a little thought tonight
[41:33] watch
[41:36] watch
[41:38] i looked up to the word and this
[41:41] little thought here was
[41:44] as i was kind of reading
[41:47] my daily
[41:48] uh devotion in the quarter of the day
[41:51] that i tried to do daily
[41:53] and sometimes even during the day
[41:57] something in it just seemed to
[42:00] caught my attention
[42:03] and i felt like it was so appropriate
[42:08] for where we are at now
[42:14] we were was working with
[42:18] any man working with
[42:20] a sure word of prophecy now
[42:27] and the reason why it is so sure because
[42:31] we are seeing
[42:33] what god has spoken
[42:36] happening right before our eyes
[42:42] and to you and i hope to myself i i say
[42:46] this
[42:48] when we see these things taking place
[42:52] though we have heard of them though we
[42:54] have uh listened to be uh spoken
[42:58] but yet to be able to understand
[43:03] what is going on in
[43:05] this time right now
[43:10] and the servant god was saying that
[43:13] there is nothing taking place that
[43:16] already been spoken of by god
[43:21] and what we are seeing going on
[43:24] in uh ukraine and the different
[43:27] countries
[43:29] and looking at russia and looking at all
[43:32] of these things and threatenings of
[43:35] nuclear war and nuclear bombs and
[43:39] all this terror and terrorizing and
[43:43] killing and and just throwing the whole
[43:46] economy
[43:48] i don't care again
[43:52] and i was saying men's hearts begin to
[43:54] fail
[43:57] because of what they see
[44:00] is taking place
[44:03] many hearts and
[44:05] pretty much well the whole world is is
[44:09] shooking up because
[44:12] they are feeling a threat of world war
[44:15] three
[44:19] they just can almost
[44:21] anticipated that
[44:23] if they
[44:24] do too much to
[44:26] uh intervene
[44:29] it will push
[44:33] this thing right out
[44:37] and they're trying to hold a middle
[44:40] ground they're trying not to really
[44:43] get involved you know in what's going on
[44:47] but
[44:48] it's difficult because you look at
[44:51] lies being slaughtered
[44:56] i'm just not talking about a regular
[44:57] wall but i'm talking about
[44:59] innocent
[45:01] hospitals and children
[45:05] being killed
[45:08] nothing even to do with the real world
[45:10] just civilians and it's supposed to not
[45:14] to be taken place because uh you know
[45:17] it's against the law
[45:19] to target hospitals and with children ad
[45:23] and uh then putting up sign that where
[45:25] they can identify their children are in
[45:28] here in uh the women's hospital where
[45:31] they are expecting uh to have children
[45:34] and babies that have it difficult
[45:37] but it seemed that
[45:39] they don't even care
[45:43] and then they hear the people
[45:45] complaining everybody seem to be touched
[45:49] by
[45:50] what's going on and react to me
[45:54] because they're human beings lives that
[45:57] are being slaughtered they're being
[45:59] killed for no reason at all
[46:05] and i believe sometimes as christians uh
[46:08] we're not uh concerned enough about uh
[46:13] what's going on not even there but
[46:16] where are we at
[46:19] in the prophetic
[46:22] wheeling of god
[46:26] we've heard it a lot we've heard it so
[46:29] much that it will become an old proverb
[46:33] it's later than we think
[46:38] what more uh uh could happen that that's
[46:43] gonna cause the people of god to
[46:46] understand that um it's the urgency
[46:53] and the word watch i like the several
[46:56] definitions of it read
[46:58] it means to keep someone
[47:02] or something under close
[47:05] observation
[47:07] to be a tentative
[47:11] or viligent
[47:12] to keep guard
[47:16] a state of alert
[47:20] in continuous
[47:22] attention
[47:25] in other words we are the worldwide
[47:27] media we ought to be uh on alert i want
[47:31] to say hi alert
[47:35] and though we are not there physically
[47:39] uh in what's going on but yet
[47:42] we are being affected by it
[47:47] one of the major things right now we are
[47:49] seeing is the gas prices
[47:53] and everybody seemed to believe to have
[47:55] something
[47:56] why why why and you know this this or
[48:00] that
[48:03] but the real thing ought to be am i
[48:07] ready
[48:10] are we ready for what is about to take
[48:14] place
[48:16] and if we are not ready what are we
[48:19] doing to get ready
[48:22] you know the bible said this he said
[48:24] examine your own self
[48:32] we
[48:32] are admonished by god that let's take
[48:36] inventory lord where am i at
[48:43] am i concerned about uh
[48:46] my soul
[48:49] do i have enough oil to make it
[48:53] i have i just like the foolish versions
[48:58] took their lamps but didn't took no oil
[49:04] and it's getting dark you're going to
[49:06] need some light
[49:09] but if you got no oil in your lamp how
[49:12] are you going to refill it
[49:16] if you don't have the holy ghost
[49:20] and if you do have it do i have enough
[49:25] see there is no
[49:27] place that you can get comfortable
[49:29] anxiety and say well i'm all right
[49:33] because i'm in a message
[49:37] that ain't gonna work
[49:40] remember the bible says the letter
[49:42] killeth but the spirit give life
[49:47] if the spirit of god has not came and
[49:50] quickened that word over make that word
[49:54] come alive in you sister brother
[49:58] you can't just rely on what we have
[50:01] heard and what we have yes it is the
[50:05] truth
[50:06] but has all my life been effected the
[50:09] way it causes as it said there in luke
[50:12] that your likes are burning
[50:17] oh my
[50:20] let me go back to luke 12.
[50:24] because i believe this is the hour
[50:29] we can't afford it at our laps go out
[50:37] i mean the scriptures say well
[50:39] uh well no our wood is then the fire go
[50:42] out
[50:52] 35 let your loan be girded
[50:55] about
[50:57] in your lights burning
[51:02] this is the hour you got to have
[51:04] something burning
[51:08] burning down in your soul
[51:12] that'll cause you to understand that i
[51:15] don't have time to play around
[51:19] we'll be all just coming to a church
[51:22] service and and singing and and then
[51:25] going back home but yet when we get back
[51:28] out there of a home
[51:30] our life still is not seemed to be
[51:33] asteroid about god we are more
[51:36] concerned about
[51:38] earthly possessions
[51:42] where i can go and what i can get and
[51:44] what i can build
[51:46] and you're bound full and running over
[51:48] and you tear down the old bars and build
[51:51] newborns
[51:55] yet your souls say that
[51:57] i need water
[52:02] the fire
[52:06] is about to go out
[52:10] how do we get the fire to burn again
[52:15] how do you get
[52:17] yourself on fire again
[52:20] see the bible says you have to learn to
[52:22] encourage your own self
[52:26] don't wait on nobody to encourage you
[52:29] don't wait on no preacher at no
[52:32] particular meeting you got to get on
[52:34] fire right now
[52:36] you got to call on god for yourself
[52:41] they understand this is the individual
[52:44] journey and god
[52:45] and nobody else don't want to go lord
[52:48] then take me hard
[52:50] set me on fire
[52:52] regardless of what's going on around me
[52:55] regardless of the education the job
[52:57] market god i need a fire
[53:04] we need a fight that's going to burn
[53:06] continually
[53:09] the burn in the midst of even what
[53:11] you're going through the fire still
[53:13] can't go out
[53:16] see i understand what the devil is using
[53:19] he's using our surroundings
[53:22] he's using our
[53:25] economical status and using these things
[53:28] around us to get our focus off what
[53:32] really matters y'all nothing else
[53:35] matters but jesus
[53:40] come on have what you will here but let
[53:42] me tell you something you better look up
[53:49] it's late
[53:52] you know sometimes you have to pinch
[53:53] your own self
[53:56] and you look around and you look at the
[53:59] conditions of people lives and you look
[54:02] at even the church world you look at you
[54:05] know the message people you look at you
[54:08] know what's going on you know around you
[54:10] and you say god
[54:12] it's like uh
[54:14] a spirit of slumber
[54:19] doesn't ease in and because that we
[54:22] think
[54:23] because of what god has given us in the
[54:25] hour we are all right
[54:32] the disappointment people is not the
[54:35] people on the street
[54:37] the great disappointment is those that
[54:39] went to church but failed to get the oil
[54:44] they failed to get what god
[54:47] is requiring them to have in order for
[54:50] them to make it
[54:51] they're sitting around looking artists
[54:53] saying why do they do it
[55:00] but there's going to be some people
[55:03] that god is going to hurt that's gonna
[55:05] press their way through
[55:08] regardless of what goes on here
[55:11] come on
[55:12] we're not worried about that i worry
[55:14] about what i got up there
[55:17] you may never own anything oppress but
[55:21] so what
[55:24] so what
[55:27] give me jesus
[55:30] you have all of america you have all the
[55:33] good you will have the best of this and
[55:36] the cattle and the great places and the
[55:39] great cars but give me jesus
[55:42] that's all going to matter
[55:45] everything else is material it's going
[55:47] to burn up
[55:51] but you label we work we struggle we we
[55:54] sacrifice for what
[55:59] to get
[56:00] to get
[56:01] to get
[56:02] to get
[56:03] to get
[56:05] to get
[56:06] just about to kill us
[56:09] don't you and the bible say the kids of
[56:11] this world will suck the very life of
[56:13] god out of you
[56:17] but notice this now
[56:20] you have to watch what are you watching
[56:24] i'm watching the fulfillment
[56:27] of the word of god in my day
[56:33] oh whoa whoa
[56:36] ii peter
[56:39] i have to read it
[56:44] because i just can't seem to get away
[56:48] it's like a peter
[56:55] 1
[57:01] 19.
[57:05] listen to what he said he said
[57:07] we have
[57:12] we have also a more
[57:16] sure word of prophecy
[57:20] where until you dewell that you take
[57:23] heed
[57:27] taking heed of
[57:30] a more sure word
[57:34] not just any word but a more sure word
[57:38] of prophecy
[57:41] drop down with me
[57:42] 21st verse the same chapter
[57:46] he said for the prophecy came
[57:48] not in old town by the will of man but
[57:51] holy men of god spake and they were
[57:55] moved by the holy ghost
[57:58] and as they were moved they were
[58:00] actually prophesying
[58:03] everything they were speaking of was
[58:06] winding up till this time right here
[58:11] here they were speaking about hundreds
[58:13] of years
[58:15] because the holy ghost moved on them
[58:19] but what they actually was speaking of
[58:22] this time here
[58:24] could there be someone say there has
[58:26] never been a day sister brother like
[58:29] this day
[58:32] we have the days of sodom and gomorrah
[58:34] the days of lot
[58:37] we see all of this coming to pass we see
[58:40] all this happening our laws and
[58:43] everything
[58:45] are just changing
[58:48] to be more corruptable
[58:51] in other words to legalize sin
[58:56] and it gets them so bad that
[58:58] this is going to be no place for us to
[59:00] live
[59:02] you know why because this stay in our
[59:03] home
[59:05] not like this
[59:08] after it burned off and god destroyed
[59:10] the elements and everything that demon
[59:12] powers and everything at the field yeah
[59:14] there will be a command not like this
[59:20] man i have no other hope than just
[59:23] eat live and be merry and died and
[59:25] miserable
[59:28] we ought to be looking forward to the
[59:30] coming of the lord
[59:33] that's why you say my his wife had made
[59:36] herself ready
[59:38] she didn't wait on nobody to do it
[59:42] she didn't wait for no preacher to do it
[59:45] she did it herself why because she was
[59:48] watching and understanding by revelation
[59:52] that day and hour i'm living in we are
[59:54] here now
[59:57] in other words we have a more sure word
[59:59] of prophecy
[1:00:04] why is it so more sure because they only
[1:00:06] spoke of it but here we are to see it
[1:00:12] and yet
[1:00:15] it's like it don't move us
[1:00:19] i was saying that our church door ought
[1:00:21] to be open
[1:00:23] daily we ought to be laying on the altar
[1:00:27] oh god i need the holy ghost
[1:00:29] [Music]
[1:00:31] lord we need a revival
[1:00:34] excuse me let me say this lord i need a
[1:00:36] revival
[1:00:39] see because
[1:00:40] we have been trying and and i know that
[1:00:43] our pastor had been laboring
[1:00:45] and and the spirit of god moving and
[1:00:48] warning and
[1:00:50] and trying to plead to the people
[1:00:53] come on let's get the holy ghost
[1:01:00] when 911 helper and different things are
[1:01:03] happening with uh katrina and i think
[1:01:05] everybody's saying pray pray
[1:01:08] pray pray keep come on everybody anybody
[1:01:13] i don't care what church to go to our
[1:01:15] door let's pray
[1:01:18] but you don't hear that call now
[1:01:23] but god is still calling see that's not
[1:01:25] man anymore now is god doing it
[1:01:29] and what he is calling those that he has
[1:01:31] elected
[1:01:34] and he put something in them that they
[1:01:37] got a thirst and a burden for oh god
[1:01:40] don't let me be this come amen
[1:01:46] just don't let me come to church god
[1:01:49] don't let me just sing a song god but
[1:01:52] move in me
[1:01:53] [Music]
[1:01:55] loose that cold spirit off of me god
[1:01:58] break these yolks
[1:02:07] but i like him because god said he will
[1:02:09] have himself a bride
[1:02:11] amen
[1:02:13] he will have himself a bride
[1:02:17] we can all
[1:02:18] claim to be
[1:02:21] that but i want to tell you something
[1:02:23] your actions gonna show
[1:02:28] your action how you moving
[1:02:32] with god are we just sitting still
[1:02:37] relaxing taking it easy
[1:02:41] to look all that we got now
[1:02:45] i believe if you want to you can have
[1:02:48] so much materialistic things can be
[1:02:51] running out of your mouth
[1:02:54] but at the end of it what good is going
[1:02:56] to do you to gain the whole world and
[1:02:58] lose your soul
[1:03:03] oh lord
[1:03:06] go with me to first corinthian
[1:03:11] i'm going to have to stop
[1:03:18] watch
[1:03:21] keep guard
[1:03:24] be attentive to what's going on in your
[1:03:26] hour
[1:03:28] the bible says study
[1:03:32] just show
[1:03:33] yourself
[1:03:36] approve you don't have to put a proof to
[1:03:39] god
[1:03:42] but always studying are we
[1:03:45] seeking the bible says seek
[1:03:47] ye first
[1:03:50] [Music]
[1:03:52] oh
[1:03:54] you might think you need a house first
[1:03:57] you might think you need a husband first
[1:03:59] or wife first but yo you need god first
[1:04:08] and if you have him you got everything
[1:04:11] you need
[1:04:13] you got a house
[1:04:17] already prepared for you
[1:04:21] no mortgage on it
[1:04:25] no light bills
[1:04:28] streaks of gold
[1:04:31] on your house
[1:04:34] no dirt roads
[1:04:36] no flowers you got the water
[1:04:41] it is so but the bible said i have not
[1:04:44] seen is had not heard the thing that god
[1:04:48] has in store for them that love him
[1:04:52] do we really love god
[1:04:55] now you say you do but jesus said if you
[1:04:58] love me keep my commandments
[1:05:02] the word that i speak to you
[1:05:06] their life
[1:05:09] so to actually show forth you love god
[1:05:12] keep his word
[1:05:14] how you gonna keep it
[1:05:17] except the holy ghost
[1:05:20] keep you you know my prayer i remember
[1:05:23] david said like this he said lord hide
[1:05:26] thy word in my heart that i may not sin
[1:05:32] hide it lord
[1:05:35] lord hide the word because uh this word
[1:05:38] that you're reading
[1:05:40] it ought to be your food morning
[1:05:44] noon day and night
[1:05:46] you've got to get the word to abide in
[1:05:49] here god got to have something to work
[1:05:52] with
[1:05:54] that's why you say if you will abide in
[1:05:56] me and my word about it then you can ask
[1:05:59] but if ain't no word in there
[1:06:03] see the holy spirit lives off the word
[1:06:08] and we have necessary natural food
[1:06:12] there's also spiritual food
[1:06:16] and that's why so many people are drying
[1:06:18] up and backsliding
[1:06:21] because they are not eating
[1:06:24] the word
[1:06:27] they are not
[1:06:29] meditating upon what god is doing
[1:06:33] right now in this particular time of
[1:06:36] life right now
[1:06:39] i'll be also remember reading that
[1:06:41] scripture i didn't go there
[1:06:43] but it says that something about um
[1:06:45] about establishing us in the present
[1:06:48] truth
[1:06:50] she did a lot of truth but we're talking
[1:06:52] about present day truth
[1:06:55] the truth for you luther had truth
[1:06:59] wesley has all of them had truth but we
[1:07:03] have present day
[1:07:06] truth
[1:07:07] the word for your hour
[1:07:10] the word that god sent for us to prepare
[1:07:14] our door he said america behold i send
[1:07:19] you elijah to turn our hearts back
[1:07:27] i wonder sometimes whether our heart has
[1:07:29] really been turned
[1:07:32] let me tell you something when
[1:07:34] your heart is turned on god
[1:07:37] nothing else really matters
[1:07:41] yes you do the thing you have to do but
[1:07:45] your focus is i got to keep my eyes on
[1:07:47] jesus
[1:07:49] no matter what i where i go or go to
[1:07:50] school i'm keeping my eyes on jesus i go
[1:07:53] to work i'm keeping my eye where if i go
[1:07:56] lord i know you're soon to come
[1:07:59] you may have missed a lot of things in
[1:08:02] life that you regret but don't miss this
[1:08:07] oh no
[1:08:09] you may have missed a lot of trips you
[1:08:11] may have listed my good career but you
[1:08:14] don't want to miss this
[1:08:19] because this is what as christian what
[1:08:21] we're living for is the second coming of
[1:08:25] jesus christ
[1:08:27] so whatever it's time to get you bind up
[1:08:31] and entangle shake it off
[1:08:35] come on somebody

[1:08:46] shake it off

[1:09:02] hear from most christians
[1:09:04] is this they say well when god get ready
[1:09:07] um to take this away i said no brother
[1:09:11] i said there's something you got to do
[1:09:13] god ain't gonna force you to do nothing
[1:09:16] but you're gonna have a desire god i
[1:09:18] don't want this thing
[1:09:21] i hate the spirit that's trying to hold
[1:09:25] me into bondage
[1:09:27] you are not to be bound by these things
[1:09:30] of this world
[1:09:31] you ought to be free
[1:09:34] what did god die for brother simmons
[1:09:37] did he die to put us in bondage no no no
[1:09:40] no no what did the message come to do to
[1:09:42] set us free
[1:09:45] from these religious spirits
[1:09:48] that have been holding us in bondage
[1:09:52] you know one of the saddest things that
[1:09:54] i've seen
[1:09:56] and i say about the lord
[1:09:59] the most
[1:10:00] terrible thing i've seen when i see
[1:10:02] christians
[1:10:04] are in bondage
[1:10:08] they ain't bondage
[1:10:10] because
[1:10:11] they don't want to fight their way out
[1:10:16] they want somebody to come and say
[1:10:19] i'mma make this devil leave no
[1:10:22] you can pray all you want for somebody
[1:10:24] but if they don't want that thing to go
[1:10:28] you'll sweat and you'll work you fall
[1:10:31] out and they still be the same
[1:10:34] there got to be something happen
[1:10:37] on the inside of them that they say i
[1:10:40] don't want this thing anymore
[1:10:43] i don't want the world anymore i don't
[1:10:46] want what this world had had to offer me
