And Lord, take away from us, oh God, anything that would hinder you from blessing your children, Lord. And I ask you to forgive us, Lord. And Lord, I ask you to move on the scene.

All you've done for me. Thank you, Amen. Can we just stand again for the reading of the word? We want to go to Proverbs 31 and 10. I'll just read one verse [Music] there. Proverbs 31 and 10. It says, "Who can find a virtuous woman for her prices fall above rubies?" May God bless the reading of his word. We want to go here to Hebrews 11. And I want to talk to you this morning about women that have a standard. Women of standard. Women of standard. We thank God for all the mothers again. Women that has a standard. Amen. And in that we want to talk a little about a mother's love and and a mother's sacrifice. you know, a mother love and a mother's sacrifice. And uh he says, "Who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies." So we thank God for a godly mother. Amen. A godly mother. Amen. It's very important, you know, that we give honor to godly women and godly mothers. Amen. So, as the world, as we know in America, we're recognizing Mother's Day. Amen. We take time out to say to the mothers, "Thank you." Say to the wives, "Thank you. Thank you for your sacrifice." Amen. Thank you for all you do. And thank you for all you have done. Amen. Amen. And it's all right to give honor where Aries do. Amen. So by the grace of God, as we look at Hebrews 11, women of standard, women that has took a stand. when the odds are against you. Yet these women stood up. They stood up when the odds were all against you. And that means, Amen. A bishop used to say, he says, "Any dead fish could go with the flow of the stream, but it takes a live fish to go against the current." Amen. So sometimes if if we want to go with the flow, but those that have a standard, amen, you go against the current. In other words, the but if you some folks just go with the way the world turns, go with the flow. But we don't want to go against the flow. We're going against the flow, against the current. We don't want to be conformed to this world. We want to be transformed. Amen. Amen. Praise God. That there's a change in godly women, holy women. Amen. Those those women, Amen. that takes a stand in a such an evil, a dark world. But we were at graduation of of Caleb the other day and my wife was she were looking at the mothers and the grandmothers and maybe the great grandmas and she was saying you know they had on their Shirley Temple. She said she called it early tempered dresses and she said they and she said those old women ought to be shaming themselves mothers, grandmothers and all. She said they ought to be shaming. Look at them. Sometimes I didn't see and the little graduates girls that were graduating. She said and sometimes they had the gowns open and she said if they sat down what they going to sit down. I said oh you know but women that take a standard ought to be honored and you know they says uh uh some that uh do double honor. Amen. So I'm saying women that that take the stand in this, it's difficult because you you're going to be identified as unpopular and you're going to be unpopular. You're going to be criticized, scrutinized, and you're going to go through something if you take a stand. But I believe there was still women that are godly women that take a stand. They're godly. Amen. Amen. and they suffer the reproach. Amen. They have to go through something for the stand that they take for God. Amen. They're going to re be reproached for Christ's sake. And it takes something. It takes a strong It takes a strong uh woman to be able to to withstand the criticism, the ridicule. It takes somebody that's Amen. that's worthy. Amen. To be called the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. We call the lamb's wife. Amen. It takes somebody, Amen. that got enough courage, that's not afraid to stand up. Amen. Amen. I think on last Mother's Day, we talked about Esther that she said, "If I perish, I perish. I'm going to see the king. Amen. She was a woman that took a stand when the odds were against us. Amen. And she had a a a hidden identity because they didn't know that she was a Jew. Are you with me? Amen. Her identity was not exposed. But it it took a time that she had to come forth. Amen. and take a stand even though Amen. It might cost her her life. Amen. But she took a stand. Amen. I need you know those type of women. Amen. Godly women. The women that could uh will take a stand when it might cost you everything. Amen. Amen. Take a stand. Amen. Not only that. Amen. I thought about the the women that when Peter was locked up in jail. Those women that prayed all night. It must was late in the night that the angel came and took the shackles off a pill because we had he had some praying sisters. Amen. Women that knew how to get a prayer too. Amen. Amen. And the angel when he got free, he went right to the house and they were still praying. Amen. And the little dancer answered the door and said, "Uh, Peter's at the door." But they said, "It must be his angel." But Peter was at the door because they were praying. Amen. Amen. Amen. If we pray, things can happen. Amen. God can make a difference. Amen. God can break the circles. Amen. of your loved ones. Amen. The ones that are bound, God can set them free. Amen. Amen. Just keep on praying. Amen. Amen. Women are standing. They don't mind praying. Amen. Till they Amen. the loved ones can be set free. Amen. Somebody grace God. I thought about those type women. When I said women of standard, women that knew how to get a prayer through. Amen. Amen. So many times I heard mama praying. Amen. And and I often times say it hurt me when I was out there in the world of sin. And it hurt me to just hear her pray. Amen. I just didn't want to I I just didn't want it. It was doing something to me because she was praying and I said, "Oh." Oh. Because you know when you're not doing right and somebody praying. Amen. Amen. and they crying out on your behalf. And I said, "Oo." So I said to those mothers that are praying, "Amen. Praise God. Keep on praying." Amen. Amen. God, Amen. Here's your humble cry. Amen. Just keep on praying. Amen. The Lord will make a way. Amen. Somehow. Amen. Just keep on. Don't stop praying. Amen. Cuz God can make the impossible possible. Amen. God can change situations. Amen. Keep on praying. Amen. For surely we don't have to go way back in the Bible days, but there are women now that take a stand that God uses. Amen. And you can be identified. May not be in the New Testament scripture, but you are there. Amen. You're there as one of those women, praying women of the church, those that Amen. know God. Amen. Know that God shall do exploits. Amen. You're one of them. Amen. And you got to identify I'm one of them. It's not only back in the Bible days. It's now in this day that I'm taking a stand. Amen. I'm taking a stand for godliness. I'm taking a stand for holiness. I'm taking a stand that God still lives and he's still real and he's still good. And I don't bother praising him. I don't talk telling the world I love the Lord. Amen. Amen. Women are standing. Amen. Don't mind praising the Lord. Amen. Don't mind testifying. Amen. Of what he's done for me. I thought about the Sunday school this morning. We brought out sister Anna and she said the doctor said I couldn't have a child. and and uh she says Charity is 15 years old. Amen. Amen. Praise God. God is good. Your faith in God. We don't have to go way back there. We know. Amen. What God did for Sarah and Abraham and know what he done for others, but he's doing it now for you and I. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Praise God. We got a testimony that we can share. Amen. Today. Amen. Amen. Women are standard. Women that are giving God all the glory and thanks for what he's done in our lives. Amen. Amen. In their lives. Excuse me. Here in Hebrews 11, it talks about this certain woman. And I like to uh often times talk about this woman because sometimes, amen, our situation, our condition, folks might would look down on you, might despise you and criticize you. But God took someone that was amen not socially accepted. Amen. not identify with the rest of the crowd. Amen. Somebody that was despised, such as the woman at the well, and he used her. Amen. Amen. I want to say your case is not hopeless. Amen. Amen. Amen. Your situation is not helpless. Amen. But God is still using women a standard. Amen. Amen. Amen. It may not may not look like a woman is standing to the world. Amen. But God in your heart, there's something burning down deep. Amen. That identifies you as a woman, Amen, a faith. Amen. Amen. In Hebrews 11 and30, it says, "By faith the walls of of Jericho fell down." Praise God. And somebody was identified with that happening. Somebody, amen, said, "I was a part of uh uh some woman could say, Amen. that I was there and I can identify." Amen. Praise God. I'll tell you, walls still fall. Amen. Amen. Jericho walls still come down. Amen. Praise God. When the enemy Amen. had you all walled in. Amen. Hallelujah. Walls still fall. Amen. Amen. Praise God. I said walls got to come down. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Walls of misunderstanding. Amen. Walls of criticism got to come down. Amen. Walls of disappointment, walls of jealousy, walls of hatred. Amen. Walls got to come down. Amen. Amen. God still bring down Jericho walls. Amen. But it took a woman of integrity, a woman, a standard, amen, to recognize by faith before the walls came down. Amen. I know. Amen. That your God is real. Amen. She was on the other side supposeding an unbeliever. Somebody that did not know the God of Israel. Amen. Amen. said she had faith that that God was a real God. Amen. Amen. That God is that was a victorious God and I want to be identified with him. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So sometimes even in our condition. Amen. We want to be identified with the living God, the true God that you know is real. Amen. She could have sat back and and said to the spies, "Don't come in my house." But look what happens in the 31st verse. By faith, the what? Now, I wonder why you want to call this woman something like that in the Bible. For that was what she was. But she didn't have to remain what she was. Amen. Amen. Are you with me? Amen. I believe God looked beyond He looked beyond her faults. Amen. He looked beyond Amen. what kind of person the world might think of her. God didn't think that way. Amen. Amen. He didn't call her a holler like that because of what he did in her life. Amen. She became amen. She became somebody Amen. that Amen. took a stand. Amen. stand with the children of God. Amen. Praise God. If Amen. If she would have asked, can I can I be one of y'all? Can I can I uh just join y'all? They might have said no. No, you are not one of us. Amen. You're not a Jew. But God look beyond that. Amen. See, sometimes Amen. Some folk Amen. But this woman, Amen, beyond the criticism, Amen. You know, she said, "If I do this, she will jeopardize jeopardize." She was in jeopardy of being killed. Are you with me? Amen. If they caught her hide, no spies, she could have died. I'm going to tell you something. You must have enough faith in what you believe and who you believe that you go beyond the criticism. You don't think about what they can do to you because you know this God. She She said she didn't see God. She said, "I heard about your God." Amen. I heard about what God dried up the Red Sea. I heard Amen. Praise God. I hope you heard about a God that can deliver. Amen. A God that saves. I heard about him. Amen. Hallelujah. That was enough. She didn't have to say. All she did was her. Amen. Something about her. Amen. That she believed. Amen. She believed what she heard. And she wanted, Amen. to be one of them. Amen. Glory to your name. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. So, here Rahab the harlot, perish not. With them that believe. What? Believe not. She wasn't harmed, but she perished not with them that what? See? Amen. Don't be a not. Don't be an unbeliever. She perished not with those that believe not. But she believed. Amen. In spite of who they say she was and what she was. Amen. Yet she believed. Amen. Are you with me? Amen. She believed that God was more than able. Amen. to deliver her. Amen. She received the spies with peace. Are you with me? I wonder, will you receive Jesus Christ with peace? Amen. Amen. Will you receive him into your heart, in your life? Will you receive him with peace? Amen. Are you with me? Amen. And 32. Let me just go ahead on read. And what shall I most say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Samson, and of Jeffa, and of David also, and of Samuel, and of the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, attained the promise, stopped the mouth of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword. Out of what? Out of weakness, we're what? Made strong. We're made strong. Amen. Amen. Watch violent in flight. Turn to flight. The army of the aliens. What? Women what? Receive their dead what?

The child was dead, but she knew that all was well. She made it to the prophet. Amen. That had spoke a word and caused the child to be born. Now, no child is dead. And she knew all was well because she made it there. Amen. Amen. She said, "All is well." Amen. Amen. Amen. And I want you to know all is well. Amen. Amen. Amen. All is well. This woman, Amen, had faith. She's a woman standing. She was a woman that believed in spite of my child being dead. I know it's well. I have faith in God. Amen. I know it's well. Amen. Amen.

Many are the affliction of the righteous, but the lost, Amen, shall deliver them out of them all. Amen. It'll be all right anyhow. Amen. Not accepting deliverance. Praise God. If you don't deliver me, I still say you're good. If you don't heal me, I still say I'm all right. I still love you. I still serve you. I still say you're good. God is real. Hallelujah. In spite of what I'm going through. Amen. and what I've been through. I'm still saying my God is able and he's still real to me. Amen. Is a good We're serving a good God. Yes, Lord. Said others had trial of cruel marking and of scourging. Yay. Moreover, of bonds and imprisonment, they were stoned. They were swn a son. They were tempted. They were slain with a sword. They wandered about the sheep skin and goat skin being desecuted and afflicted. Of whom what? The world is what? I said the world is not worthy. Amen. Amen. They wandered in desert and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth. And having these and these all having attained a what? Good report. Amen. A good report. See, you must have a good report. These had a good report. Amen. You know the Isaiah said, "Whose report will you believe?" Amen. Amen. Amen. But when God Amen has evaluate and give you a report card in the grave, Amen. will you be a woman of standard? one that took a stand and before a crooked and perverse generation, a wicked generation, a generation that rejected the word of God and didn't want the word. Will you take that stand? Would you be one of them and said, "Lord, I'll take a stand for you because one day you stood on the cross and you didn't come down. You would despise the shame." Amen. Amen. You know, I thought about the story of this young girl that was coming home from college on the train and uh she looked after the wonderful her mother was at the train station and her mom was disfigured and she was so, you know, wasn't nothing proud to look look at and the girls from the college that was on the train with the young lady said, "Oh, who's that ugly lady?" In other words, they were saying how bad that woman looked. And the young lady know that was her mother and she sat there and she didn't say nothing at all. She didn't say that's my mother. But she was ashamed to let those girls that were picking at this woman that was burnt had been through the fire and was burnt and her face looked all marred. There used to be a pretty woman but she had been burnt. See, the daughter was ashamed. The story goes on to tell when she got off the train, she almost wanted to shine her mom because she was ashamed of her mom. But the story was that the house caught on fire and the house caught on fire. Mama knew that her baby was in there and mama hazard her life to go back into that fire and get her baby out of there. I said the sacrifice that mothers make a mother's love. Mother sacrifice. She sacrificed. Now she's the little girl looking now all pretty. But the daughter sometimes folks are ashamed to be identified as a Christian. Shame. Jesus was marred. There was no beauty that we should desire him. When they crucified him, they just whipped him and beat him. So much as so they he looked defeated. All forsook him. But yet he was wounded for our transgressions. Bruised for our iniquities. Yet he died anyhow. In spite of how we done, we didn't want him. I hope you understand what he did for you. Amen. He went to hell when you should have went there. Amen. He died when we should have died. Amen. That we might have eternal life. Amen. Are you with me? Amen. Another story about a a man hot hunting deer and he had made a contraction uh and I was down in Louisiana. They had a uh some type of instrument duck call and they can sound like a duck and it cause the ducks to come and and this man had something that a type of a gadget that he had made to cause the deers to come like he's a a a fawn uh that's what you call it, brother Gerald? A baby deer. And uh he blew it like he was in trouble. And here the dare mother dear what you call it mother a devil. The dough heard and though it was she come out in the open looking for the baby. And the infidel man didn't know God getting ready to blow the heart out of the deer couldn't do it from it. He saw a mother's love that she was willing to lay down her life for the baby. mother's love. When Solomon had the woman come forward that had stole another woman's baby and he said, "Let me cut the baby in half and give you half of it and her half of it." The one of the woman that has stole the baby. She say, "Well, that's all right with me." But a mother's love says, "Let her have it. Let her have the baby." Because she knew that woman had stole her baby. So she said, "Let let her let let her have it. I rather her have a live baby than you to cut the baby in half and give me half and her half." Amen. The other woman didn't care. I'm talking about women of standard. Amen. Women that has motherly love. Amen. They're willing to Amen. give up. They're right. And Solomon says, "Huh, that's the real mother right there. The one that was willing to give that baby up before they killed the baby." Are you with me? Amen. And I'm going say I'm going to tell you women today, women of standard, mothers that made sacrifices for you. It ought to not just be on Mother's Day. Did you say, "Mama, I love you. Grandmama, I love you. I appreciate what you done for me and what you're doing for me." If you don't tell them you love them any other time, you can tell them today, "Mother, I love you." You know those words are hard to say for a man. Sometimes they don't mind saying it when they don't mean it. But when they mean it, look like they have trouble saying I love you and thank you. I tell my wife, "I love you and thank you." And I look at my children, I said, I thank my wife. Why I thank her? Cuz a lot in the midnight hour sometime the man is just stay there and sleep a little while longer. Mama going to what? She heard that baby crying. She what? keep getting up and seeing about that baby. Now sometime they might say you get up. But as a whole mama making the diapers sometime children get big and heavy and they want you to hold them. And sometime I don't know how mamas can uh uh uh take and had the strength cuz sometime they be little and the baby look like they almost like but they have strength to hold on to those babies and to carry them when they can't carry themselves. Mama's love mama that cares that make sacrifices. It's a sacrifice that they made that you here. Think about those not all the time the mothers that did not care, did not take time to reel you, didn't take time to change your diapers and clean you up. Amen. I'm talking about the mothers that have sacrificed their time, their effort, their life for you. You can take time out to say, "Thank you, Mom. I appreciate it." Amen. And whatever you can do for a mother. Amen. If you had a good mother, do all that you can do to try to make her happy. Do all you can do to try to make her happy. Amen. Because one day, Amen. Mother won't be there. And when mother don't ain't no replacement for mother when mother's gone. So while you have the opportunity to do something, let mother know you love her and that you appreciate what she's done. You know, I sat in the room when the children were being born. I think my wife went out and that line went blank on Caleb and the doctor said, "Pray, pray, pray. Everybody pray. I can't lose her now." And the blood was just gushing, gushing. And they did a Caleb Holland, mama gone, blank. And God by the grace of God, everybody calling on Jesus. The doctor calling on Jesus. Everybody in the room calling on Jesus said, "Rabb call on Jesus." Everybody praying that she come back and she came back. But with Rachel, everything just they said, "Hold it, hold it, hold it. Wait till the doctor get I ain't can't wait. [Music] That was fast. Quick. Come down to Josh. Nine months pass. Lord know about that. Nine month pass and he still ain't going to come. Still ain't coming. They got to some long. It took too long for him to come. Well, he finally came. But it was way late. I remember Lord's mama said, "Tell those people to take that baby when when Pete was born cuz they ain't no it was taking too long." But God is good. It's good to have mama. Amen. You know, I was seeing the little baby uh the other day and he was cry. I know he was is sleeping, but he kept moving and squenching. And Renee was taking her hand and just rubbing the baby gently like that. I said, "What you doing?" She said, "I just rub." You see, he he he doing a lot of squenching in his sleep. And I just rub him like that and that'll calm him down. He can go to he can sleep well. And that's what happened. And I said, "Oh, sit down." You know what you doing? You You understand? You know now me I'm I'm thinking what's she doing? That baby sleeping. But she said he's squenching and going on. He ain't sleeping well. And uh she just rubbed his little stomach and he slept well. But I'm saying a mother's love. It wasn't her baby. It was one of the niece baby. You know what I'm saying? And I'm saying it's something about a mother. When she see a baby, she just can I hold it?

Okay, I know hopefully God will look upon this word and you heard something that would just cause you to see the love of God and how he cares. If the the the deer could care, if that mother could go into that fire, how much more that our heavenly father loves us enough to die on the cross for our [Music] sins? How can we say thanks to him? How can we tell him, "Lord, I love you for all you've done for me." Yes, for you've done so much for me and I don't deserve all your goodness, but thank you for loving me the way you do. As our heads bow our hearts are looking to him. Thank you, Jesus. Father, in the precious name of Jesus Christ, thank you for your love. Thank you for caring about us. Thank you for still yet caring.

So, Father God, in the name of Jesus, your children, [Music] your children that you had in your mind before the foundation of the world, there'll be one here this morning that receive the love of God in their hearts. They would accept what you done for them. when you died on the cross to save us as our heads are bow is that one that Lord come into my heart forgive me of my sin I want to be saved just lift your hands and pray for me I want to be saved this morning I want Jesus to come into my heart thank you thank you thank you Jesus come into my heart I want you to live inside of me.

If not, we going to go. God bless you. Hey, ho ho ho. For one minute, brother [Music] Chappelle. What brother Sim saying about a mother love? I seen something that I'll never forget it containing a mother. Um, I was coming from Okoney and all of a sudden here come this cat. She had three little kitties. She grabbed two of them and carried them to the side and the truck I had had big tires and I was just driving. That cat come right in front of where I was. She stood there and I stopped. She picked up that little kitten, took it to the other side of the road where her safety at and looked back. And I was like, I'll never forget that cat sacrificing her love for that one child that she risked her whole life. She risked her life to come back to get. And you know that just like mother today, you know, us men, we sit up, we take things the way men do, but a woman going to sit there, she going to heal it all. She going to heal it all. Make this heat. Heat. Heat.
