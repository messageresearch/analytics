[29:59] Amen. Aren't you glad he did?
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Let us just stand this morning for the

[31:59] filled with your spirit, God. But we
[32:02] need you now. Have mercy on us. In Jesus
[32:06] Christ's wonderful name we pray. Amen.
[32:11] As we stand the book of St. John
[32:15] 18 and33.
[32:18] Praise God. This morning we were last
[32:22] week or so we were dealing with the
[32:25] truth.
[32:28] The truth.
[32:30] Amen.
[32:38] It says in 33, I'll read the first,
[32:40] you'll read the next, and we'll read the
[32:44] 38th verse together.
[32:49] Then Pilate entered into the judgment
[32:51] hall again, and called Jesus, said unto
[32:55] him, "At thou the king of the Jews?" 34
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered him
[33:04] thyself or others of
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Palan answer am I a Jew
[33:11] thy own nation and the chief priests
[33:14] have delivered thee unto me what hast
[33:19] thou done 36
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this
[33:25] world if my kingdom were of this world
[33:28] Then would my servants fight that I
[33:30] should not be delivered to the Jews. But
[33:33] now is my kingdom not from hence.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Pilate therefore said unto him,
[33:41] thou king. Then Jesus answered,
[33:45] thou said that I am a king. To this end
[33:49] was I born. And for this cause came I
[33:52] into the world that I should bear
[33:55] witness unto the truth.
[33:58] Everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[34:03] voice. 38 together Pilate said unto him,
[34:07] what is truth? And when he said he went
[34:12] out to the Jews and said unto them, I
[34:16] find in him no fault at all. God bless
[34:20] you. Read this word. You may be seated.
[34:22] Thank God for
[35:08] and throughout America and the world may
[35:11] go because they believe that they are
[35:14] going for the truth.
[35:17] Many people are sincerely
[35:21] uh persuaded that what they believe is
[35:25] truth.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; So and then for because we come to
[35:31] church we take for granted that
[35:34] Christianity is the right way and not
[35:36] Buddha, not Hinduism, not Confucianism,
[35:38] not Muhammad
[35:41] of Muslims.
[35:43] We believe that we are coming to church
[35:45] because we're serving the true and
[35:47] living God.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; So Pilate asked the question because he
[35:53] would didn't identify himself as a Jew
[35:56] or as a as a believer. He says to uh
[36:01] your people, your your your high priest
[36:05] and all of them, they they they
[36:06] delivered you to us. What what what did
[36:09] you do?
[36:12] And Jesus question answered about my
[36:17] kingdom is not of this world.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; You know he he understood that he said
[36:24] are you a king?
[36:27] So uh often times people will question
[36:31] your relationship with God and who are
[36:33] you?
[36:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; What kind of church is this that you go
[36:37] to? What what do you believe?
[36:40] Mhm.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; And uh who do you think you are? Why go
[36:44] to the church you go to?
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Why believe like you believe?
[36:51] &gt;&gt; So here what he says, I came to bear
[36:55] witness of the truth.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Blessed Jesus.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; So Paul, the question was, what is
[37:00] truth?
[37:03] &gt;&gt; I was just talking last week down in
[37:04] Louisiana. What is truth?
[37:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:08] So um
[37:11] but this morning I I I said the truth
[37:14] for a subtopic a strong delusion.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; A strong delusion.
[37:24] Sometimes we are not hallucinating but
[37:29] because of certain uh religious ideology
[37:34] sometimes we are not
[37:37] in love with God like we should be
[37:40] because
[37:42] sometimes it's deception is in among us
[37:47] and we believe in a different
[37:50] persuasions
[37:54] Denomination got its own truth.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; The Baptist have their truth.
[38:00] The Methodists have their truth.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Catholicism have their poke in their
[38:06] truth.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Different apostolic PW has their truth.
[38:14] UPC has their truth.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Bless.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Church of God in Christ have its truth.
[38:21] Church of God has its truth.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Church of Christ has its truth.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; And I can go on and on.
[38:30] People are not going to church to hear
[38:34] something that's false,
[38:36] &gt;&gt; but they're going to church because
[38:38] they're persuaded that they're going to
[38:40] hear the truth.
[38:43] As I said, Paul said, "What is truth?"
[38:50] Since Jesus said he bear witness of the
[38:52] truth,
[38:54] what is it?
[38:57] Second Thessalonians
[38:59] the second chapter. I want to just talk
[39:02] about for a moment a strong delusion.
[39:06] Could we be in a delusion? A strong
[39:09] delusion?
[39:12] Are we really
[39:15] worshiping God? Not like the woman at
[39:17] the well. She went there to worship God
[39:21] because uh she said our fathers worship
[39:24] in this mountain.
[39:27] He said, "But the Jews said in
[39:29] Jerusalem, that's where we ought to
[39:31] worship."
[39:33] But he said, "Our father Jacob build
[39:36] this well."
[39:38] Sometimes you look at grandma,
[39:40] granddaddy or some family member that
[39:43] has started the church and started the
[39:45] religion and
[39:48] and she had a a reputable representative
[39:52] that the reason why she worshiped in
[39:55] that mountain.
[39:57] She had a godly man that had wrestled
[40:00] with her angel and name was changed from
[40:03] Jacob to Israel
[40:07] and he had power with the Lord.
[40:12] Sometime we can look back and we can see
[40:15] the foundation in which our uh uh
[40:19] religion our faith was based upon. And
[40:22] sometimes it was godly people that
[40:24] struggled and battled and believed God
[40:27] and trusted God. But
[40:31] that was then.
[40:34] But what's now?
[40:38] See
[40:40] Jesus said
[40:42] the hour cometh to the woman and now is
[40:46] that the true worshippers of God going
[40:48] to worship him not at Jerusalem and
[40:51] neither in this mountain but the true
[40:53] worship is going to worship him in
[40:55] spirit
[40:56] &gt;&gt; and in truth.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; So he was bringing us to present tense
[41:01] truthmen.
[41:04] That was the truth that was God was
[41:06] revealing for the hour that he was in.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; For Jesus went into the temple and he
[41:14] took the book and he read the spirit of
[41:17] the Lord God is upon me for he has
[41:19] anointed me to preach the gospel. He
[41:22] went on to talk about proclaim liberty
[41:25] to them that was bruised.
[41:27] Amen.
[41:29] And somebody said he come to lead
[41:32] captivity captive.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:37] Those that were bound, he was going to
[41:38] set them free.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "You shall know the truth, and
[41:44] the truth shall what? Make you
[41:46] &gt;&gt; free."
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Make you free.
[41:49] So often times we struggle. We battle.
[41:53] We go to church and we take for granted
[41:55] that what we're hearing and what we're
[41:58] listening to because somebody read out
[42:00] the Bible. Somebody quoted scripture.
[42:02] Somebody Amen. spoke to our conscience
[42:05] and made us feel a little better.
[42:09] And we thought perhaps this is all I
[42:12] need.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; But I said truth is not limited to your
[42:16] church.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] It's not limited to your denomination
[42:21] and to your ideology, your what you
[42:24] believe. The truth is not limited
[42:29] &gt;&gt; to what you think.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Some people have bottled it up and think
[42:34] they got it.
[42:36] Fail to recognize the truth.
[42:40] Amen. It's continually being revealed
[42:44] &gt;&gt; to you as an individual.
[42:48] The Bible said the path of the just
[42:50] proverb says that the shining light was
[42:54] shining more and more to the perfect
[42:56] day.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; If I can get ahead of myself for a
[43:00] little while, Jesus said that I am the
[43:04] way.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; To answer the question, what is truth?
[43:08] She said, I am the way,
[43:10] &gt;&gt; the truth, and the what?
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Light.
[43:15] So if you think that your church or your
[43:18] preacher uh uh uh is the truth, then you
[43:23] certainly you would be wrong.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; You would think that some man or some
[43:29] preacher or some poke or uh some doctor
[43:33] of theology or uh some nomination of
[43:37] persuasion is truth then you would be
[43:40] certainly wrong.
[43:43] Amen. me think because I join the church
[43:47] and I'm a member of such and such that I
[43:50] have the truth so you might set safe and
[43:54] secure
[43:56] thinking that all is well and I don't
[43:59] have nothing to worry about because I've
[44:01] joined the church
[44:03] maybe I've been baptized uh maybe I
[44:07] maybe spoke in tongues maybe I shouted
[44:11] maybe I cried eyes
[44:15] for what is truth.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Is it possible
[44:21] that I could be deceived? That I could
[44:24] be uh led astray?
[44:28] Could it be possible that what I'm
[44:31] believing now is past truth, past tense?
[44:36] And could I believe that what's going to
[44:38] happen in the future not recognizing
[44:41] what truth is today and what God is
[44:44] doing for us right now
[44:47] for he said he opened the book he said
[44:50] the spirit of the Lord is upon me for
[44:53] he's anointed me to preach the gospel
[44:54] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[44:57] your ears
[44:59] &gt;&gt; he was identifying his ministry and what
[45:02] he was doing
[45:04] &gt;&gt; and said this today.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; I believe that we ought to be fired up.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Stirred up.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; On fire for God.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I would that you hot or cold,
[45:18] lukewarm. I'll spew you out my mouth."
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; We ought to be excited.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Because of the truth, light has shine.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; In our hearts.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:34] Now I got to go back here and try to
[45:38] catch everybody up because I've talked
[45:41] too long.
[45:43] It says, "Now we beseech you, brethren,
[45:46] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[45:49] and by our gathering together unto him."
[45:54] That's what we're gathered to him.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; That you be not what? Soon what?
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Shaken in mind. shaken in mind or be
[46:01] troubled, neither by spirit, nor by
[46:05] what?
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Word.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Word, nor by letter as from us, as that
[46:11] day of Christ is where?
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Now, that was 2,000 years ago.
[46:18] Could it be prophecy that that day now
[46:21] is at hand?
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Because he said that that day is at
[46:25] hand.
[46:27] Could God be speaking?
[46:30] Amen. When Isaiah wrote Isaiah uh 61,
[46:34] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me.
[46:37] Jesus picked it up and he read it in
[46:40] Luke and said in Luke, he said, "The
[46:43] spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has
[46:45] anointed me."
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You must know if God has
[46:50] anointed you.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; And you recognize who you are. And are
[46:55] you the anointed word for the hour that
[46:58] we live in?
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Are you the manifestation?
[47:04] Amen. What God is doing in this last
[47:06] day?
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Is your life, Amen, reflecting the the
[47:11] light that God said he would shine in
[47:13] the evening time?
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And can you identify with
[47:18] that truth?
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And can you Amen. stand as Jesus
[47:23] stood? said, "I am the way, the truth,
[47:25] and the life."
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, huh,
[47:32] you sound a little,
[47:35] you know, you you sound a little on
[47:37] yourself, isn't this is an individual
[47:40] journey. You must identify who you are."
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and
[47:45] the life." He I am not not I was, not I
[47:49] shall be, but I am.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; You got to know who you are. Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not just coming to church and going
[47:56] through motion. I know who I am.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; And who's I am
[48:00] &gt;&gt; amen. Praise God.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I can identify with the word
[48:05] that's promised for this hour.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you can be in a promised
[48:11] word, but is it promised for the day?
[48:15] Your promises that God promised you for
[48:18] this hour.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Can you identify God? You promised me,
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; in this day,
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That you would have a people
[48:28] on the scene,
[48:30] &gt;&gt; a church that would be not spot or
[48:32] wrinkle. Amen. A blemish or any such
[48:35] thing. Not just any kind of way we come
[48:38] to church, but a holy people.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; A people that don't mind praising God.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; To recognize that they are the lights
[48:47] that's going to shine in a dark world.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know who I am. Oh God,
[48:54] &gt;&gt; something got to happen down deep in our
[48:57] soul.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; The quicken us. Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; The quickening word for the hour that we
[49:05] live in.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe that the spirit of
[49:09] the Lord has uh hh anointed us to bring
[49:14] forth, Amen. the shining light for the
[49:17] hour that we live in. But if you don't
[49:20] know, then I said down there, uh, we
[49:24] don't light a candle and put it on the
[49:25] busher. That's right.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; If you are the lights of the world, it
[49:29] be a city that sets on a hill that
[49:32] cannot be hid.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; But when we take the light and put it
[49:36] under the bushel,
[49:38] amen, it ain't no good.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; God wants you on a candlestick. You need
[49:43] to be praising God because you are the
[49:46] light. Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; You need to let everybody know, amen,
[49:49] that Jesus Christ is alive
[49:53] and well.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; He lives within me.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; I love him and he
[50:00] &gt;&gt; loves me.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't mind. I know what
[50:04] he's done for me.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; I know he died for me.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know he rose again.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just 2,000 years ago, but he
[50:15] has risen in my life.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; For he said, "You has he quickened who
[50:21] were dead and trespass in sin."
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You has he made alive when you
[50:26] were dead and trespass in your sin, now
[50:29] you're alive.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be alive.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. In the third verse of 2
[50:39] Thessalonians 2, he said, "Let no man
[50:41] what?
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Deceive you
[50:43] &gt;&gt; by any means."
[50:46] God have mercy.
[50:48] People just take it for granted that
[50:51] this deception is not working.
[50:56] He said, "The spirit speakest expressly
[50:59] that the latter days men should depart
[51:02] from the faith, giving heed to deducing
[51:05] spirits and doctrines of devils."
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Did the Bible say that?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't let no man what?"
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Bible said, "A serpent
[51:16] begal Eve through his satility, so your
[51:19] mind should be corrupt from the
[51:21] simplicity that is in Christ." Isn't
[51:23] that right?
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said, "Let your women
[51:26] keep silent in the church, for it's a
[51:28] shame for them to speak. If they can
[51:29] learn anything, let them ask their
[51:31] husband where."
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish they could ask your husband
[51:36] at home.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[51:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now," he said, "if Adam was
[51:44] not deceived, but the woman was deceived
[51:47] being in the transgression."
[51:49] Ain't that right?
[51:51] Uh it ain't this ain't the right day to
[51:53] say that. Isn't it right? It's Sunday
[51:55] morning.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; But we're talking about deception. Isn't
[51:59] that right?
[52:01] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a strong delusion.
[52:03] How do people become delusional
[52:07] and go to church and they delusional?
[52:10] How did they get in that kind of
[52:12] condition?
[52:15] People almost believe that it's all
[52:17] right uh for homosexuality. It's all
[52:21] right to have a a church full of all
[52:24] kind of craziness going on and showing
[52:26] and performing.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Let's have let's just have some praise
[52:31] dances and dance over here. Let's have
[52:33] this and let's have that.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; They coming to church and they
[52:37] entertaining folk instead of folks
[52:39] coming under conviction and said, "I
[52:41] need God."
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; I need deliverance.
[52:44] I need Jesus.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; We're interested in performing.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means that
[52:57] that day shall not come. Talking about
[53:01] except there come a what?
[53:05] &gt;&gt; And that man of sin be revealed the son
[53:09] of predition. Ain't that right?
[53:12] Maybe it's the folk out of the USA
[53:16] who's who opposes and exalt himself
[53:19] above all that is called what?
[53:22] &gt;&gt; God
[53:22] &gt;&gt; all that is worship so that he as God
[53:27] what
[53:29] &gt;&gt; of God
[53:29] &gt;&gt; showing himself that he is
[53:32] &gt;&gt; God. Are you with me?
[53:35] &gt;&gt; People can you reckon people can sit in
[53:37] the temple of God and be worshiping the
[53:40] wrong one?
[53:41] worshiping the devil and don't know it
[53:45] &gt;&gt; cuz they will receive a strong delusion.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Go to church and look. Oh, he said if
[53:51] it's possible he deceived what?
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Very elect.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Very elect. The Bible said a and he
[53:57] talks about uh the beasts. And he said
[53:59] he deceiveth the whole what?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; All them whose names are not written in
[54:04] the lamb book of life before the
[54:06] foundation of the world. Ain't nobody
[54:08] going to deceive me. I know. No, no, no,
[54:11] no, no, no. He deceived the whole world.
[54:13] And if it was possible, he deceived even
[54:15] the very elect.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; But for the elect's sake, he short the
[54:19] days.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; So don't think, hey, nobody going to
[54:24] deceive me. Praise God. Oops.
[54:29] I know. I know. Read my Bible. I know
[54:32] God,
[54:34] man. Let's be humble.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Say, God, show me the way. Yes.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, lead me. Guide me.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; For I need your your guidance.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; I need your help.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Because I can't leave myself. I need you
[54:51] to lead me.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Talk to me, Lord.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; I desire truth. The Bible says, David
[54:58] said, "I desire truth from the inward
[55:00] part."
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; I really desire truth.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; I want it.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He that hunger and thirst after
[55:08] the righteous, it shall be what?
[55:10] &gt;&gt; I want truth. I don't want to just go to
[55:12] church and thinking and feel all right
[55:14] and thinking I'm all right. Give me the
[55:16] truth.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Tell me the truth. If it hurt me, tell
[55:20] me.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; I want truth.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; You know, I feel so sorry. I go to
[55:27] funerals and I feel sorry for the
[55:28] people.
[55:31] It sound so pretty cuz everybody going
[55:35] to heaven sound pretty.
[55:37] Amen. The one that sang for the devil
[55:39] all their life talking about they baby
[55:42] and this and that sometime some of the
[55:44] filthy stuff you want to hear but if
[55:47] they have they happen to die they going
[55:49] to hell.
[55:52] I tell you something. Then we'll sing
[55:55] may the life I live speak for me. I
[55:57] wonder which one you talking about.
[56:00] May the life I live speak for me. Which
[56:02] one?
[56:04] &gt;&gt; That life you live, you lived it right
[56:06] there for the devil and you never, you
[56:09] know, you didn't talk about Jesus. You
[56:11] didn't reflect the light of God or
[56:14] nothing. But all of a sudden, you die,
[56:16] you going to heaven. Oh, they have a big
[56:18] show, big service, and even the the Oh,
[56:21] Lord,
[56:25] am I delusional?
[56:27] Is my mind correct? Am I thinking
[56:30] correct? Or am I in a delusion?
[56:34] Not just a delusion. He said strong.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; He says
[56:43] it be a fallen away first. Not just stop
[56:46] coming to church. Amen.
[56:49] But spiritually, people have fell so far
[56:53] away from God. What used to be right
[56:54] ain't right no more.
[56:57] what used to be people don't they look
[57:01] like there's no respect for the Bible
[57:04] &gt;&gt; they do what they want and then worship
[57:06] God just how they want to do it and when
[57:08] it come down you show them Bible they
[57:10] say well that ain't what we believe
[57:14] that ain't what we believe you know we I
[57:17] I I tend to believe this okay let me see
[57:22] why people believe like they leading
[57:28] fallen away first and that man of sin be
[57:31] revealed the son of predition. Who
[57:32] opposes and exalt himself above all that
[57:35] is called what?
[57:36] &gt;&gt; God.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; God. People think they God.
[57:41] Ah I'm spiritual. I you know I believe
[57:44] in spirit. I believe in God cuz they
[57:47] make themselves God. Uh that is worship.
[57:52] So that he as God sat in the temple of
[57:56] God, showing himself that he is God.
[58:00] Remember ye not that when I was yet with
[58:03] you, I told you of these things. And now
[58:07] ye know what was holding that he might
[58:11] be revealed in its time.
[58:14] For the mystery of iniquity doeth what?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; See, he's talking about over 2,000 years
[58:20] ago. The mystery of iniquity was already
[58:22] working. Iniquity is something that you
[58:26] know better and you still do it.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Some people know they wrong, but they
[58:33] still do it.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, God will forgive me of
[58:41] everything
[58:42] except for blasphemy against the Holy
[58:46] Ghost.
[58:47] So, iniquity. I know I'm wrong, but all
[58:51] you got to do is pray.
[58:54] You think you can play with God like
[58:56] that? Before I go to bed at night, I
[58:58] might have drank all night and I might
[59:00] have laid up with somebody wife and all
[59:02] this and that. But all I got to do ask
[59:05] God to forgive me for I go to sleep and
[59:08] God forgive. You going to control God.
[59:11] Don't play with God.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; It's a time that we get cleaned up.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:18] Time that we get our lives in order.
[59:20] Clean me, oh Lord.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wash me that I may clean. Jesus.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need to be washed.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. For I acknowledge my
[59:31] transgressions.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; I know I'm wrong. Lord, have mercy on
[59:36] me, Lord.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Renew a right spirit within me, Lord.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; I need to get right with you, God. I
[59:45] don't want to play around. Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, just you don't know what they done
[59:51] before they died and all that. Praise
[59:54] God. Dean them and God trying to wish
[59:57] everybody go to heaven. But you know, I
[59:59] know it's not going to be because broad
[1:00:01] is the way to lead to destruction.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Narrow and straight. If we got a chance
[1:00:08] to live right, let's do right.

[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; I'mma tell you.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:43] He says in the a verse, "One day the
[1:02:45] Holy Ghost going to be lifted." He and
[1:02:48] then shall the wicked be what?
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; The wicked be revealed whom
[1:02:55] the Lord shall consume with the what?
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Spirit of his mouth.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Spirit of his mouth. He's coming.
[1:03:02] Two-edged sword coming out of his mouth
[1:03:05] and shall destroy with the what?
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Brightness of his coming.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Brightness of his coming. He's coming.
[1:03:12] This old wicked world. One day God going
[1:03:14] to come.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; This world going to burn like an oven.
[1:03:21] Going turn it upside down like a drunk
[1:03:23] man.
[1:03:25] God don't come and judge the world in
[1:03:27] righteousness.
[1:03:29] It's coming.
[1:03:31] You see the signs of it coming. Every
[1:03:33] day it getting worse and worse.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; America is under the judgments of God.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they won't turn and
[1:03:43] repent.
[1:03:44] Judgment is striking. Amen. All over the
[1:03:47] world. It's sad to see. Amen. So many
[1:03:50] children running. So many people going
[1:03:53] through. Amen. The fires and the storms.
[1:03:56] It's a sad occasion. Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; My heart's bleed, but this judgment is
[1:04:02] hitting the earth.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; God is calling out that, "Why don't you
[1:04:07] repent of your sin?"
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; There'll be some that will repent and
[1:04:11] say, "God, I've been living wrong. I've
[1:04:14] done wrong. I need you, Jesus. Forgive
[1:04:16] me, Lord."
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Well, will America as a whole repent?
[1:04:20] No.
[1:04:22] But there'll be some that will repent of
[1:04:25] their sins and be baptized in the name
[1:04:28] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:04:29] sin. And the promise is you shall
[1:04:32] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:33] There'll be some that were repaired of
[1:04:35] their sins and they'll turn to God
[1:04:39] because they know, Amen. They see the
[1:04:41] signs of the coming of the Lord. They
[1:04:43] see the signs of the time and they'll
[1:04:46] Amen. They run while they have a chance
[1:04:49] and get in Christ before it's too late.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; One day you'll wake up and it'll be too
[1:04:55] late.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Said at the funeral yesterday,
[1:05:05] uh
[1:05:10] my sister-in-law brother just went home
[1:05:12] sitting on the porch and death came by.
[1:05:17] didn't know death would come by.
[1:05:23] Then we all go through a little sadness
[1:05:27] this morning is brother Carol passing
[1:05:29] away because the sometimes it's
[1:05:33] unexpected.
[1:05:35] You don't know when, you don't know how,
[1:05:38] but you got to be ready.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; You got to be ready.
[1:05:45] So I'm saying
[1:05:47] get your life in order.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Get your life in order.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan would do some stuff to try to
[1:06:07] deceive you. The Bible says
[1:06:11] God's going to consume him with the
[1:06:14] spirit of his mouth, the brightness of
[1:06:16] his coming. I believe God is coming to
[1:06:19] shine a bright light in this hour.
[1:06:23] It's consuming all that false stuff
[1:06:27] cuz God is revealing
[1:06:31] Satan and where he's hiding it. He been
[1:06:34] hiding a long time, but God has
[1:06:36] revealed, exposed him. True. Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; John talked about the spirit of
[1:06:42] Antichrist was already working.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; But the Antichrist was coming.
[1:06:52] I believe he'll show up soon.
[1:06:54] And I believe that those that are not in
[1:06:56] Christ, it'll be too late then.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:01] They have to receive the mark of the
[1:07:03] beast that they all might be damn. Oh, I
[1:07:07] got ahead of myself. Let me let me just
[1:07:09] going to read in the 10th verse. He no
[1:07:14] ninth verse. He says, "Even him whose
[1:07:16] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:07:18] with all what?"
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[1:07:26] the devil should deceive
[1:07:28] him. and with all deceveness of
[1:07:31] unrighteousness and them that what?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Perish.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Perish. You deceive them that they're
[1:07:36] going to perish because they receive not
[1:07:39] what the truth.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; See, you tell the people the truth. A
[1:07:43] woman ought not to be preaching. They
[1:07:46] don't love that.
[1:07:48] You trying to say to man, you're male
[1:07:50] showing this. You're this, you're that.
[1:07:58] Homosexuality is wrong.
[1:08:01] Everybody, you don't know what God made
[1:08:03] me this way. That's all right. God made
[1:08:06] some people some people's bone liars.
[1:08:12] Amen. Somebody was born, you know, born
[1:08:15] with me. I got a big head.
[1:08:19] I ain't had nothing to do with it. I was
[1:08:20] just born with a big head. You know what
[1:08:23] I'm saying?
[1:08:24] Some people are just born. Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; But h I'm glad I could be born again.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; I was born a sinner. How about you?
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; But God But I'm so glad there's a savior
[1:08:36] there to save me from my sin.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; That I can be born again.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; See what I'm saying? It We can't help
[1:08:47] how we were born, but we can help. Amen.
[1:08:50] We can receive a new birth and be born
[1:08:53] again.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; We can receive Jesus Christ. No matter
[1:08:57] what kind of shape we were in, Jesus
[1:09:00] will Amen. turn amen the darkness into
[1:09:04] light.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus can make the valley a mountain and
[1:09:09] he can bring Amen. the mountain down to
[1:09:12] the valley.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; He can make the crooked straight
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; if you allow him to do it. Ain't that
[1:09:18] right? So don't worry about a thing. God
[1:09:20] is able
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; to save us to the utmost.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what condition you're in.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; He'll save and heals.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; I feel all right.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz they didn't love the truth that they
[1:09:42] might be saved.
[1:09:45] They go to church. I ain't going to that
[1:09:47] church.
[1:09:49] I I don't want to look like those people
[1:09:51] and I don't believe what they believe.
[1:09:53] So I ain't going.
[1:09:56] They ain't going to tell me nothing. I
[1:09:58] know God
[1:10:01] and God didn't speak to me tell me that.
[1:10:04] The Bible said it. The Bible said in the
[1:10:08] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:10:09] with God and the word was God.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible said we we were held him as he
[1:10:18] was grace and truth. Ain't that right?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; So he said, "I am the way, the truth,
[1:10:24] and the life. No man can come to the
[1:10:26] father but by me. You who you think you
[1:10:28] are, you know, humble yourself."
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; And see what the word say. I want to do
[1:10:35] what you say, Lord.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Uh well, God, you got to listen to me.
[1:10:40] I had one big preacher, one of the
[1:10:42] biggest churches in Colombia, and the
[1:10:44] preacher said, "Ah, when sister so and
[1:10:47] so get to heaven, she ain't going to
[1:10:49] say, I want to see Paul. I I want to see
[1:10:52] Jesus." She said, "I want to see Paul
[1:10:54] because I'm going to straighten you out
[1:10:56] concerning women preachers
[1:10:59] and all those people." I said,
[1:11:00] "Goodness, y'all. Y'all must you mean to
[1:11:03] tell me this this sister going to
[1:11:06] straighten Paul out?
[1:11:08] Paul didn't preach what he wanted to
[1:11:10] preach. It was the word of God.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Paul. It was God that was
[1:11:16] saying that it's in the Bible. That's
[1:11:18] the word was God.
[1:11:21] Those people they clapping their hand. I
[1:11:23] said, "Man, you with your doctor degree
[1:11:26] and all of your religion, you going to
[1:11:27] sit down and you got enough nerve to say
[1:11:29] something like that in the pullpit. I
[1:11:31] lost all respect of you."
[1:11:35] It could have most of those people
[1:11:37] should have walked out. Could have
[1:11:38] jumped up and walked out. But you know
[1:11:41] what? They sat right there, clapped
[1:11:44] their hand, believed that she going to
[1:11:46] straighten Paul out. I said, "Did I hear
[1:11:49] with my ears?"
[1:11:53] Oh, God.
[1:11:55] We we're in a a a a delusion
[1:11:59] a world and people go to church and set
[1:12:02] up under because they got a doctor
[1:12:05] degree and because they can articulate
[1:12:07] good and maybe amen they got a good
[1:12:10] choir and good this and good that and
[1:12:12] maybe hundreds and maybe thousands going
[1:12:15] there.
[1:12:17] So we believe that that's truth because
[1:12:19] the crowd is going there. The big shots.
[1:12:23] Are you with me?
[1:12:26] But it'll be so simple.
[1:12:28] Amen. It'll be straight and it'll be
[1:12:30] narrow. Few going to find that. Are you
[1:12:34] with me?
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Because most people don't want it.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he came into his own his
[1:12:41] own what?
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; They didn't want it. He was in the
[1:12:44] world. The world was made by. But the
[1:12:46] world didn't know him.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:50] He's in the church and the church put
[1:12:53] him on the outside.
[1:12:56] So, we don't want him in here.
[1:12:59] He's He's speaking to our heart, but we
[1:13:01] don't want him in our hearts.
[1:13:04] We don't want him in our lives because
[1:13:06] we want to be in control of our own
[1:13:08] life.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; We want to do what we think is right.
[1:13:17] We want to be in control him, not he
[1:13:19] control us. Are you with me?
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Y'all better I I got to This ain't a
[1:13:27] Sunday morning message, but he's on my
[1:13:29] heart because my heart is bleeding. One
[1:13:31] day I have to give an answer to God. One
[1:13:33] day I'm going to have to stand up and
[1:13:34] say, "God," he going to say, "Why didn't
[1:13:36] you tell him the truth?"
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, I don't want to be
[1:13:39] guilty. I've been to too many funerals
[1:13:42] lately to be guilty
[1:13:45] of telling the people the truth.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Some people don't want to
[1:13:50] line up with the word. They want the
[1:13:51] word to line up with them.
[1:13:55] Praise God. God don't have to. You can't
[1:13:57] make God no better than he is.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; If God said, Amen. It'll last throughout
[1:14:02] eternity. Yes, Lord.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; You know, I was singing this song,
[1:14:04] everything going down but the word of
[1:14:06] God.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Everything going down, but the word is
[1:14:09] going to stand. When it's all over,
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; word of God still be there.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Get in the word and stay there.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Be ready when Jesus come.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Get in that word.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Don't play around with your soul.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means.
[1:14:32] that that day would not come except
[1:14:34] there be a falling away first and that
[1:14:37] man of sin be revealed.
[1:14:40] Amen. Praise God.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; That little man will try to sit in the
[1:14:44] throne of your heart.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; He'll try to set in your heart and he'll
[1:14:49] try to deceive you.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; But you got to love the truth.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I love the truth.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, I love the truth.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; I'm concerned. Every hurt, I'm love the
[1:15:00] truth. I want to know the truth.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I admit it just to walk out because you
[1:15:06] tell him the truth.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Hey, it's abomination in the sight of
[1:15:09] God for a woman the way that was
[1:15:11] attained to a man. I'm gone.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Bless Jesus.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; I gone. No, no, don't tell. Don't tell
[1:15:17] me that. I do what I want.
[1:15:21] People are stubborn.
[1:15:23] They're heady. High minded.
[1:15:26] You can't tell them because somebody
[1:15:28] going to tell them it's all right. It's
[1:15:30] all right. You don't have to do all
[1:15:32] that. You come here, you can go to

[1:16:18] Talking about living a godly life and
[1:16:20] being perfect. Ain't nobody can be
[1:16:23] perfect.
[1:16:25] And who you who you don't
[1:16:28] be perfect as your father which is in
[1:16:30] heaven is perfect. Who said that?
[1:16:33] Jesus, right?
[1:16:36] Well, why you want to Well, you mad at
[1:16:38] Jesus and tell Jesus I can't be perfect.
[1:16:41] He said be perfect.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen."
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; But if he said be, he must have made a
[1:16:46] provision how you can be.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; He said be holy for I am what?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Holy. So he must made provision that you
[1:16:53] can be holy. Amen.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I done went too long this morning.
[1:17:00] There's a whole lot of people going to
[1:17:01] turn turn me off. Turn
[1:17:04] you off. I can't can't listen to no
[1:17:06] more. Are you with me? But I tell you
[1:17:10] what, I feel the judgment of God
[1:17:12] striking the earth. And I feel like it's
[1:17:14] going to be any moment I got to tell the
[1:17:16] people now. Cuz if I don't tell them
[1:17:18] now, I don't want them. God going to
[1:17:20] hold me responsible.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:23] And I don't want to be responsible for
[1:17:25] not telling you the truth.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going tell you. Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; It may be a few go and few some might
[1:17:32] fall out with me and hate me for now,
[1:17:35] but there'll be others that say, "Thank
[1:17:37] you for telling me the truth."
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; May not be but a few, but there'll be
[1:17:41] one some that say, "I want to know the
[1:17:42] truth."
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I ain't worried about how
[1:17:46] much money you give and how much you
[1:17:47] want to give, and it doesn't make that
[1:17:49] difference with me.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there'll be some uh that's
[1:17:54] going to uh be charger because they want
[1:17:58] 50 ler. They want your money.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we ain't worried about that.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; We want you to go to heaven.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Want you to live right.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you don't give a dime,
[1:18:10] want your soul to be right with God,
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; it's going to work out all right.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sad.
[1:18:22] I'm sad. My heart bleeds.
[1:18:24] I'm not upset with people, but these
[1:18:27] preachers, Lord have mercy, I'm kind of
[1:18:31] they they they do a good job deceiving,
[1:18:34] man. I couldn't even I couldn't even I
[1:18:36] preach them. No. No way. Cuz they know
[1:18:40] they they know they in school. They know
[1:18:42] how to get to your mind.
[1:18:45] But they they telling you the truth. Oh
[1:18:47] boy. They can articulate. They can make
[1:18:50] it so good.
[1:18:52] And you said, "Well, that's kind of
[1:18:54] that's good preaching." It's good
[1:18:55] preaching, but is it good to your soul?
[1:19:01] Okay. Love the truth
[1:19:05] because they receive not the love of the
[1:19:07] truth that they might be what?
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Saved.
[1:19:13] Many tell me those folk ain't saved.
[1:19:16] The Bible said after saving the children
[1:19:18] of Israel out of Egypt, he after
[1:19:20] destroyed them because of what?
[1:19:23] After Jesus, you've accepted Jesus as
[1:19:26] your personal savior and he come into
[1:19:27] your life. Then he wants you to take you
[1:19:30] into the promised land, the promise of
[1:19:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But after
[1:19:35] saving the people, they didn't go into
[1:19:37] the promised land because they didn't
[1:19:39] believe. Are you with me?
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; So God after justification, God wanted
[1:19:44] to sanctify you. clean your life up. But
[1:19:47] you you just say, "Well, I'm saved.
[1:19:49] That's enough." But God promised you if
[1:19:51] you repent of your sin, be baptized in
[1:19:53] Jesus' name, you shall receive the gift
[1:19:55] of the Holy Ghost. But some people say,
[1:19:58] "Well, I'm satisfied. I've been
[1:19:59] baptized. God, Jesus come." No, no, no.
[1:20:01] Justification, sanctification, then the
[1:20:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost. God want to
[1:20:06] clean you up. He want to s justify you,
[1:20:09] want to save you, then he want to
[1:20:11] sanctify you, clean your life up. Then
[1:20:13] he want to fill you up with the Holy
[1:20:14] Ghost.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; But if you don't want to be all I want
[1:20:19] to be, I'm saved and I know I'm saved.
[1:20:21] Still smoking, drinking, running around,
[1:20:23] and you ain't sanctified yet. I know I
[1:20:26] accepted Jesus. You did. You did. But
[1:20:29] that was all in your head. It didn't
[1:20:30] change your life. It's intellectual. You
[1:20:33] did just what the preacher said, the
[1:20:34] church say, but you didn't do what God
[1:20:36] said. He said if thou can you confess
[1:20:39] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:20:41] believe in thy heart.
[1:20:43] So it didn't go down in your heart.
[1:20:46] Because it went down in the heart then
[1:20:48] you're going to go on keep on believing.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; There's going to be changes in your
[1:20:52] life.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to go back home and
[1:20:55] still do the same thing.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Okay.
[1:21:02] Leave me alone.
[1:21:05] Leave these people alone.
[1:21:08] I hope you just preach about the joy of
[1:21:10] the Lord and Jesus died for the sin to
[1:21:13] leave the people alone.
[1:21:16] People don't want you to leave them
[1:21:18] alone.
[1:21:21] Let the people just come to you want to
[1:21:23] run everybody off.
[1:21:25] You be here by yourself at the bar.
[1:21:29] Are you with me?
[1:21:31] I'm not trying to run people off. I'm
[1:21:33] trying to tell you the truth.
[1:21:35] Are you with me?
[1:21:38] You say, "Well, you're doing a good job
[1:21:39] at
[1:21:42] Well, no. I had eight, right? That's all
[1:21:45] went in. The whole world and just eight
[1:21:47] people were saved." Ain't that right?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Going out of Sodom, no city probably
[1:21:53] full of people. But it only how many?
[1:21:55] Three. They had four, but one looked
[1:21:58] back. Isn't that right?
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; The Bible said after Oh, Lord. I ain't
[1:22:04] trying to justify nothing. Just tell the
[1:22:06] people the truth. That's all I Okay.
[1:22:10] The 11th verse. I'm I'm I'm about to
[1:22:12] close. He says, "And for this cause God
[1:22:15] shall send them what?
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Strongusion
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; that they shall believe what?
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; A lie."
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; People had their opportunity.
[1:22:24] These preachers,
[1:22:26] the people had their opportunities,
[1:22:29] but they didn't love the truth.
[1:22:32] They had the opportunity.
[1:22:36] They They had the opportunity to believe
[1:22:38] the truth and to accept the truth. They
[1:22:41] had the opportunity,
[1:22:44] but because they didn't love the truth,
[1:22:46] God sent them a strong delusion that
[1:22:48] they might believe what
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; you sitting on the borderline right now
[1:22:54] questioning God's word.
[1:22:57] right on the border line of the promises
[1:23:01] of God, God taking you, Amen, and really
[1:23:04] baptizing you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:23:06] filling you with his spirit, but you're
[1:23:07] on the border line just like Israel came
[1:23:09] up to the border line. They knew that
[1:23:12] the land flowed in milk and honey cuz
[1:23:14] they had evidence of it.
[1:23:18] They knew that what God promised was
[1:23:20] real, but they didn't go in because they
[1:23:24] talking about the giants in the land.
[1:23:26] Oh, you got to live this way. You got to
[1:23:28] live that way. You can't do this. You
[1:23:29] can't do that. The giants in the land.
[1:23:31] The walls are high. The Oh, you the
[1:23:34] judge sites, the pious sites, the
[1:23:37] habits, and all of that is in the land.
[1:23:38] The Canaanites. Oh, we ain't able to go
[1:23:41] over there. God said, "I give you the
[1:23:44] land. I ain't able to live right. I
[1:23:47] can't do it. I I ain't gonna do all of
[1:23:49] that."
[1:23:51] Oh,
[1:23:53] but as others say, Lord, I want the
[1:23:55] truth.
[1:23:56] If you told me to do it, Amen. then I'm
[1:23:59] going to take this land and Amen. It
[1:24:02] flows with milk and honey. You gave it
[1:24:04] to me. Those old Canaanites, Habites,
[1:24:07] and all, they on my property.
[1:24:09] Amen. All these demons, Amen. Amen. That
[1:24:13] possessing your life. Amen. I want to be
[1:24:16] sanctified.
[1:24:18] God clean my life up.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I don't care how many spirits, Amen,
[1:24:23] that inhab.
[1:24:26] I want to be holy.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be in heaven places in
[1:24:32] Christ Jesus. I want the glory of the
[1:24:35] Lord. I want the power of God in my
[1:24:37] life. Lord, I want you to use me. Amen.
[1:24:40] I want to praise you.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; I'm coming on, Lord.
[1:24:51] I'm coming, Lord. That the king. Amen.
[1:24:54] The kingdom of God is not meat and
[1:24:57] drink, but is righteousness, peace, and
[1:24:59] joy in the Holy Ghost. Lord, I want the
[1:25:02] Holy Ghost experience. Lord, give me the
[1:25:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh Lord,
[1:25:09] coming on in my promised land.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; I want the promise. Amen. I want it.
[1:25:14] Give it to the Lord.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, whatever it takes, I want it.

[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; There's a set back in.
[1:25:27] You know how many went said they can
[1:25:30] make, Lord, I I want it. The other 10
[1:25:35] said, "No, no, y'all can't have it."
[1:25:38] You know how many churches you can go to
[1:25:41] tell you you can't get the baptism of
[1:25:42] the Holy Ghost and you can't live the a
[1:25:46] godly life and a holy life.
[1:25:50] But there are just two Joshua and Caleb.
[1:25:54] Amen.
[1:25:57] Joshua type of the Holy Ghost and Caleb
[1:26:00] is a type of the true believer. Are you
[1:26:02] with me? Those two saying, "We we more
[1:26:07] than able.
[1:26:08] Yes. Yes, you can live holy in this
[1:26:11] hour. Yes, God still heals. Yes, God
[1:26:15] still saves to the utmost.

[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; and I don't believe you brought me this
[1:26:40] far to leave me.

[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's good to me.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, if you bought me out, you can take
[1:26:54] me in.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; If you bought me out of sin, God, you
[1:26:57] can fill me with the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, you can. Hey,
[1:27:03] I don't need what the Egyptians had.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; I don't need the golden calf. I don't

[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Those people are delusional.

[1:29:21] kind of way and go to church and the
[1:29:22] preacher tell them all you got to do is
[1:29:24] pray and do all that filth and all that
[1:29:27] ungodly stuff and your life never is
[1:29:30] changed. There's no victory in your

[1:29:35] you with me?

[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not against nobody.

[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:30:30] I love them.
[1:30:32] Just want to see them.
[1:30:35] I don't want the devil to deceive them.
[1:30:39] I don't want them to think
[1:30:41] they're their right and turn down truth.
[1:30:47] They turn down truth to believe the lie.
[1:30:52] The lie of the devil. Don't turn it
[1:30:54] down, brothers and sisters. You can be
[1:30:56] tempted.
[1:30:58] The devil fight your mind, battle you,
[1:31:02] tempt you,
[1:31:04] but realize there's something deep down
[1:31:05] in your soul.
[1:31:07] I've been ordained for before the
[1:31:09] foundation of the world.
[1:31:12] God foresaw me in. I know he did. Why?
[1:31:15] Cuz he just won't let me go.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He just won't let me go.
[1:31:21] Something inside of me bear witness with
[1:31:23] the truth.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; He said they that are of the truth. He
[1:31:28] said they hear my what? Voice.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Didn't he say that when I read it, John?
[1:31:33] that they they that are of the truth
[1:31:35] will hear my voice.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is God's voice? It's his
[1:31:40] word. Amen. You're going to hear God's
[1:31:42] word
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; and believe it.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may not understand it all, but
[1:31:47] you just believe it. It's the word of
[1:31:49] God.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; And if you're of the truth, you going to
[1:31:52] hear it. Amen. The others, they
[1:31:56] they look like they can't even
[1:31:59] comprehend it. They just put it their
[1:32:00] hands over their ears. They don't want
[1:32:02] to hear it.
[1:32:03] Praise God. But those that are of the
[1:32:06] truth, Jesus said they hear my voice
[1:32:12] as our heads bow, hearts are looking to
[1:32:14] him.
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:19] You may heard the preacher say things
[1:32:22] this morning,
[1:32:26] but what is your heart?
[1:32:29] Is your heart hearing you?
[1:32:32] It is that little small still voice
[1:32:36] that tells you what truth is.
[1:32:39] That the same voice that tell you if you
[1:32:42] about to do something wrong, said don't
[1:32:44] do it.
[1:32:46] But that same voice is saying to you
[1:32:48] this morning,
[1:32:52] my sheep know my voice.
[1:32:58] and a stranger they would not follow.
[1:33:03] Lord,
[1:33:05] I desire truth from the inward part.
[1:33:10] I want to to know the truth
[1:33:14] for you said the truth will make me
[1:33:16] free.
[1:33:19] Not just church, not just joining the
[1:33:21] church, but I want God.
[1:33:25] I want the true and living God.
[1:33:29] I want you to live in me, Lord.
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:33] Lord, let my life reflect your truth.
[1:33:38] Your word might radiate and might shine
[1:33:41] through me.
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:44] For thy word is a lamp unto my feet,
[1:33:47] light to my path, and the word of a
[1:33:49] hidden my heart that I might not sin
[1:33:51] against you.
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:33:55] I wonder this morning as our heads are
[1:33:57] bowed hard to look into him,
[1:34:00] the truth.
[1:34:03] Am I in the truth?
[1:34:07] Are you in Christ or you just in the
[1:34:09] church?
[1:34:14] Are you in the kingdom
[1:34:17] of Jesus Christ or you just going to
[1:34:20] church?
[1:34:21] For he said, "My kingdom is not of this
[1:34:23] world."
[1:34:25] Colossians tells us he delivered us from
[1:34:27] the power of darkness and translated us
[1:34:30] into the kingdom of his dear son.
[1:34:33] Have you been translated
[1:34:36] or do you want to be translated this
[1:34:38] morning?
[1:34:40] Can God amen you from the powers of
[1:34:43] darkness?
[1:34:45] Translate you into the kingdom of his
[1:34:46] dear son.
[1:34:49] Would there be one today
[1:34:51] that would lift your hand, pray for me,
[1:34:54] pastor, I need
[1:34:57] to be translated
[1:34:59] into his kingdom. I want to your heads
[1:35:03] up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[1:35:04] Thank you. Thank you. Translate me.
[1:35:07] Thank you. Thank you.
[1:35:10] I want that to be born again. I want the
[1:35:13] Holy Ghost. I want God in my life. God,
[1:35:17] I know you're real. I know you spoke to
[1:35:19] my heart. Uh know my needs, Lord. I need
[1:35:22] you, Lord. Lord, fill me with your
[1:35:25] spirit, Lord. Come into my heart. Make
[1:35:28] me over, Lord. Baptize me with your
[1:35:31] spirit. I need power. I need faith. I
[1:35:33] need you, Lord. Help me, Lord.
[1:35:37] Here I am, Lord. I need your help,
[1:35:41] Lord. Let your love be shed abroad in my
[1:35:44] heart, Lord, that your light can shine
[1:35:47] through me, Lord. Lord, I welcome you.
[1:35:50] How many said, Jesus
[1:35:52] said, Jesus,
[1:35:54] come into my life
[1:35:56] and light it up for me
[1:35:59] for I need you, Lord. I love you.

[1:36:19] Just just want to pray for him.

[1:36:27] us, if you want prayer this morning, you
[1:36:32] can come.

[1:39:24] Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:39:25] praise.
[1:39:30] Let's bow our heads. Lord God, we thank
[1:39:32] you for allowing Brother Simmons to get
[1:39:33] out of the way so you may speak your
[1:39:35] oracles to your peoples. We pray that
[1:39:36] you'll bless the blessed congregation as
[1:39:38] they leave your presence, but never
[1:39:40] leave your presence, but always abide in
[1:39:41] thee, oh Lord. Lord, we pray that you
[1:39:44] let your wordate in our souls and in our
[1:39:46] vessels, Lord. And may we meditate on
[1:39:48] these things as we leave this place
[1:39:49] whenever your presence. Grant all of
[1:39:51] these blessings in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:39:52] We thank you for all things. Let us say,
[1:39:54] amen. Amen.
