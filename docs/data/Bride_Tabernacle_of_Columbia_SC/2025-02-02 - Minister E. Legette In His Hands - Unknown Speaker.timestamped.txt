[48:49] verse
[48:51] amen we got it say amen and it reads
[48:55] listen oh all
[48:57] unto me and hearken ye people from AAR
[49:00] from far the Lord ha called me from the
[49:03] womb from the bows of my mother hath he
[49:07] made mention of my name and he ha made
[49:10] my mouth like a sharp Sword and the
[49:12] shadow of his hand hath he hidden me and
[49:15] made me a polished shaft and his quiver
[49:18] hath he hidden me and said unto me thou
[49:21] art my servant oh Israel in whom I will
[49:25] be glorified
[49:27] then I said I have labored in vain I
[49:29] have spent my strength for not and in
[49:32] vain yet surely my judgment is with the
[49:34] Lord and my work with my God and now
[49:38] sayth the Lord that formed me from the
[49:41] womb to be his servant to bring Jacob
[49:44] again to him though Israel be not
[49:46] gathered yet shall I be glorious in the
[49:49] eyes of the Lord and my God shall be my
[49:52] strength you may be seated we're going
[49:53] to read down a little further amen he
[49:55] says my God be my strength amen come on
[50:00] that's one strength that won't fail amen
[50:02] y'all believe that this morning here in
[50:04] the sixth verse he says and he said it
[50:07] is a light thing that thou shall be my
[50:09] servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob
[50:11] and to restore the preserved of Israel I
[50:14] will also give thee for a light to the
[50:16] Gentiles that thou mayest be my
[50:19] salvation Toto the end of the Earth thus
[50:21] sayith the Lord the Redeemer of Israel
[50:23] and His Holy One to him whom whom man
[50:27] despiseth and to him whom Nation abh
[50:30] horth the servant of rulers King shall
[50:34] see and arise princes also shall worship
[50:37] because of the Lord that is faithful
[50:39] amen you thank God for being faithful
[50:41] this morning that's one thing I know
[50:43] amen that in all things God is faithful
[50:46] amen amen I can't remember one time
[50:50] where he ever fell Hallelujah he didn't
[50:53] come through amen but he's always been
[50:56] what faithful Amen in all things God is
[50:58] faithful we're not faithful but he is
[51:01] faithful Hallelujah that's why I'm glad
[51:03] he doesn't he doesn't do as as they say
[51:06] like um you know like I guess I don't
[51:09] know the correct terminology but you
[51:11] know Tit for Tat or whatever they call
[51:13] it but God loves you unconditionally
[51:15] amen it's not what you can do or what
[51:18] you've are or what you going to do or
[51:20] can do for him in that way but God loves
[51:22] you just because amen because of you are
[51:25] his elect you believe that this morning
[51:27] and that that's what makes us love God
[51:29] even the more amen when we can see
[51:31] ourselves and know that we don't have
[51:33] what it takes to pay the price
[51:34] Hallelujah we never could pay the price
[51:37] right but he was able to go and pay a
[51:40] debt that he didn't know right even
[51:42] though we oldow he was willing to go pay
[51:44] that debt right and that's what
[51:45] encourages us when the devil try to beat
[51:47] you down sometimes and and look at
[51:49] yourself and all that I just remember
[51:51] that I ain't worthy noow Hallelujah but
[51:54] I'm I only come because God chose me
[51:56] Hallelujah I'm only here because God
[51:58] called me and if God had to call me and
[52:01] and and chose me and predestinated me
[52:03] before the foundation of the world and I
[52:05] wouldn't be here today so it was God
[52:07] choosing it wasn't my choosing so all I
[52:09] can do is just praise God and glorify
[52:11] his name along the way through my ups
[52:13] and downs through my valleys Hallelujah
[52:16] through my trials and tribulations all I
[52:17] can do is say God thank you Lord anyhow
[52:21] Hallelujah he says here in in the in the
[52:24] 7 verse to to the servant of rules of
[52:26] King K shall see and arise princes shall
[52:28] worship because the Lord is faithful and
[52:30] the Holy One of Israel has what chose
[52:34] thee th thus sayith the Lord in an
[52:37] acceptable time have I heard thee how
[52:39] many glad for that and in the day of
[52:42] salvation have I what helped thee and I
[52:45] will preserve thee and give thee for a
[52:48] covenant of the people to establish the
[52:50] Earth to cause to inherit the desolate
[52:54] heritages that thou May say to the
[52:57] prisoners go forth to them that are in
[53:00] darkness show yourselves they shall feed
[53:03] and do and the ways and their pastures
[53:07] shall be in all high places they shall
[53:10] not hunger nor thirst neither shall the
[53:13] heat nor the sun Smite them for he that
[53:16] have mercy on them shall lead them
[53:19] Hallelujah even in the springs of the
[53:22] waters shall he guide them and I will
[53:25] make all my mountains away and my
[53:27] highways shall be exalted behold these
[53:30] shall come from far and low these from
[53:32] the north and from the from the west and

[53:44] Lord have comforted his people and will
[53:46] have mercy upon his afflicted but Zion
[53:50] but Zion said the Lord have forsaken me
[53:53] and my Lord has forgotten me and this is
[53:57] a question can a woman forget her
[53:59] suckling child that she should not have
[54:03] compassion on a son of her womb yay they
[54:06] may forget yet will I not forget thee
[54:10] behold I have Graven thee in the palms
[54:12] of my hands thy walls are continually
[54:16] before me thy children shall make haste
[54:18] thy destroyers and they that may thee
[54:21] wayte shall go forth lift up thine eyes
[54:24] round about and behold all these gather
[54:27] themselves together and come to thee as
[54:30] I live sayth the Lord Thou shalt surely
[54:33] clothe thee with them all as an ornament
[54:36] and bind them on thee as a bride doeth
[54:40] may God a bless to the reading of his
[54:41] word this
[54:42] morning God is good amen you know one
[54:46] thing about God he always gives us
[54:48] precious promises don't he amen and I
[54:51] love the Lord for that because one thing
[54:53] I know that God can't break his promises
[54:55] can he amen amen come on we as
[54:58] individuals break our promises all the
[55:00] time but God can't break his amen you
[55:02] know the the more we go into this life
[55:04] and and I want to talk this morning
[55:06] about in in in God's hands Amen in God's
[55:11] hand is in his hands amen and I says
[55:14] that the more we go on in this life you
[55:16] know and and the more we experience some
[55:18] things then that's the more that it's
[55:21] going to either you know your trial
[55:22] tribulation going either bring you
[55:23] further to God or it's going to I mean
[55:25] closer to God or it's going to drive you
[55:26] further away amen but I don't know about
[55:29] you but the more I go through those
[55:31] little ups and downs it brings me just
[55:34] that much closer to God hallelujah that
[55:36] I can look back over some of the
[55:38] victories that God has already brought
[55:40] us through and I can say Lord I I know
[55:43] that throughout all of that God I was in
[55:45] your hands come on how many realize that
[55:48] this morning you know I was telling uh I
[55:50] think it was brother Damon last night I
[55:52] was standing on the church step the
[55:53] other day and and I was thinking about
[55:56] some things and and over the last 20
[55:59] something years and I said Lord I look
[56:02] at some of the things that I went
[56:03] through and some of the things that I've
[56:05] been through and I said even in all that
[56:08] I said I was in God's hands and all that
[56:11] I've been through and some of you can
[56:12] reach Back 40 years amen I know my
[56:15] little 20 years don't amount to a whole
[56:17] lot but I says I thank God for the 20
[56:20] years amen because God didn't have to
[56:23] keep you one day did he but he desired
[56:26] to keep you and I say God if you kept me
[56:28] this far Lord I know that you'll keep me
[56:31] keep me on right so we want to talk
[56:34] about in his hands this morning I was
[56:35] thinking about situations and I said in
[56:37] all those situations not one time was I
[56:40] ever out of God's hands amen come on and
[56:43] all that I went through not one time was
[56:45] it I never out of God's hand right but I
[56:48] was in God's hand the whole time
[56:50] Hallelujah and I like that how he lead
[56:53] he led you Hallelujah he going to guide
[56:55] you and one thing about it he said the
[56:57] Lord is faithful right and all of the
[57:00] time seems like to be desolate don't you
[57:03] know that I never hungered Hallelujah I
[57:05] never thirst I might have got to the
[57:07] point to where I thought I was but when
[57:09] I look back I didn't lose no weight
[57:11] Hallelujah I'm talking about spiritual
[57:13] weight now come on I might didn't lose
[57:15] no physical weight neither but we going
[57:17] to talk about that right now come on but
[57:20] I ain't lost no weight did I come on I'm
[57:22] plump in the spirit Hallelujah I still
[57:25] got joy on speakable and full of Glory
[57:27] Hallelujah I'm just as happy today about
[57:30] serving the lord than I was before I
[57:32] started why Hallelujah because all that
[57:36] I've been through God always showed up
[57:38] and solidified Hallelujah made me that
[57:41] much stronger to let me know that I'm
[57:43] here come on Amen Hallelujah I don't age
[57:46] with Time come on I'm just as strong
[57:48] today as I was back then oh Jesus God
[57:52] shows us that don't he but what messes
[57:54] up us up in the
[57:56] is that we see how the world is changing
[57:59] right we see how the world is going on
[58:01] and they getting that much further away
[58:03] from God right to where there sometimes
[58:06] there don't even seem to be an open
[58:08] Vision right but in that time God is
[58:11] still speaking right in a time of no
[58:14] open Vision God came to Samuel one day
[58:17] didn't he begin to speak to him about
[58:19] the lamp that went out Hallelujah and I
[58:22] come to light the fire back oh Jesus and
[58:26] I thank God for that that's been my
[58:27] prayer God light the fire back
[58:30] Hallelujah come
[58:31] on where they cool off at light the fire
[58:34] again come on let it burn Hallelujah and
[58:39] I believe God to do that all you got to
[58:41] do is call for it right come on God is
[58:44] right there waiting all you got to do is
[58:45] call for it a lot of times we realize
[58:48] situations would have been a lot easier
[58:50] Hallelujah if we to looked to the Lord
[58:52] from the beginning right but we waited
[58:54] and we waited then all of a sudden you
[58:56] know but what happens desperation bring
[58:58] God on the scene don't it come on you
[59:01] get desperate enough you learn how to
[59:03] cry out then right come on but then God
[59:06] begins to to show you those things you
[59:08] know uh uh like we always say scriptures
[59:11] become alive in your time of need don't
[59:13] it come on no longer that you just heard
[59:16] it but it becomes it's alive then right
[59:19] come on and I don't know about you but I
[59:21] I love the Living Word Hallelujah I was
[59:24] telling saying about someone the other
[59:26] day I saying you know you need a
[59:27] religion that's going to that's going to
[59:29] help that's going to change you right
[59:31] that's going to be able to do something
[59:32] for you hallelujah amen I know one one
[59:35] of guys got a lot of intellectual
[59:36] knowledge and all that but he can't seem
[59:38] to get over his right he still can't
[59:41] defeat himself he still got all kind of
[59:43] battles in his flesh and all kind of
[59:45] things because I says that what you got
[59:47] ain't changing you Hallelujah but I says
[59:50] that you need something that's going to
[59:51] change amen what's going to change it's
[59:54] going to be more than just the letter of
[59:56] the word but it's going to be the Holy
[59:57] Ghost Hallelujah that's why Jesus told
[1:00:00] Peter and NOS he said after you be
[1:00:02] converted then go strengthen your
[1:00:03] brotherr right I know you can't help
[1:00:06] yourself right now but when the Holy
[1:00:07] Ghost comes come on and when I put my
[1:00:10] spirit in you then I'll cause you to
[1:00:13] walk in my statues Hallelujah you won't
[1:00:15] have to worry about trying no more it'll
[1:00:17] be easy now Hallelujah because it'll not
[1:00:20] be you but it'll be me living in you
[1:00:23] come on Hallelujah and I thank God for
[1:00:26] that it's always pray I said Lord help
[1:00:28] me cuz I'm afraid of myself I don't know
[1:00:31] what I'm capable of but when he came
[1:00:33] Hallelujah I didn't have to worry about
[1:00:35] it no more right because now what it is
[1:00:37] I just let him take over those times
[1:00:40] where I don't know what to do I just let
[1:00:41] go and let God take over come on put it
[1:00:44] in God's hand and I'm going to let God
[1:00:45] take over how many feel like doing that
[1:00:47] this
[1:00:48] morning come on but I said in his hands
[1:00:50] come on many of times you know uh like I
[1:00:54] say you might think
[1:00:57] because sometimes people have gotten so
[1:00:59] out of contact with God right so out of
[1:01:01] contact with the spirit that they forget
[1:01:03] they acknowledge Him right you know the
[1:01:05] Bible says that trust in the Lord with
[1:01:07] all thine heart lean not to thine own
[1:01:10] understanding but in all thy ways do
[1:01:12] what acknowledge Him right come on ask
[1:01:15] God about it hallelujah how many want to
[1:01:18] ask God about it come on I don't know I
[1:01:20] want to ask God about it God is this
[1:01:23] your will Hallelujah cuz if it ain't
[1:01:25] your will then I don't want to do it God
[1:01:27] but if it's in your will then give me
[1:01:28] Faith Hallelujah to stand here when the
[1:01:31] winds begin to blow come on Hallelujah
[1:01:35] something about it when you acknowledge
[1:01:37] God and it's God that's leading you no
[1:01:40] matter where you at when God leading you
[1:01:42] got faith right you understand that it's
[1:01:45] God that brought me here hallelujah one
[1:01:48] thing about the devil he can't cross the
[1:01:49] blood line can you I always tell tell a
[1:01:53] testimony about one night I was at the

[1:02:02] powers all over and I kept like I was
[1:02:06] hearing something beating at the door
[1:02:08] and I said uh something was telling me
[1:02:11] that's fear trying to grip your heart
[1:02:13] but don't let it come on cuz don't you
[1:02:15] know fear got torment don't it come on
[1:02:18] why fear when you can have faith why are
[1:02:20] you fearing when God is on your side

[1:02:25] against us
[1:02:26] come on sometimes we got to remember
[1:02:28] that who is on our side Hallelujah
[1:02:31] sometimes we got to remember who called
[1:02:32] us who we running the race for
[1:02:35] Hallelujah but I remember that I got up
[1:02:38] I walked up to the front door and I can
[1:02:41] feel like pressures things was demon
[1:02:44] powers right I might have looked crazy
[1:02:46] but nobody saw me in the middle of the
[1:02:48] night but I began talking to the front
[1:02:51] door I said devil you might snare and
[1:02:54] you might bite like sister want us the
[1:02:56] same but you going to lose this battle
[1:02:58] tonight because you came cross the

[1:04:15] presence of your enemies hallelujah oh
[1:04:18] Jesus when you're outnumbered by the
[1:04:20] demon powers trials and tribulations
[1:04:24] then all of a sudden the anoint oting

[1:05:25] God's Got control of the
[1:05:27] situation but it's up to you and I to

[1:05:32] Hallelujah long as you stay in God's
[1:05:34] hands you'll be all right hallelujah oh

[1:05:40] the Harlot and H you know they knew that
[1:05:42] destruction was coming to the city right
[1:05:45] but one thing about it God gave her a
[1:05:46] token didn't he come on he said long as
[1:05:49] you hang this out of the window
[1:05:51] Hallelujah and everybody in the house
[1:05:53] that's with you come on they'll be sa
[1:05:55] save Hallelujah but also told them but
[1:05:58] those that go out we ain't going to be
[1:06:00] responsible for them now come on you got
[1:06:02] to stay in the ark Hallelujah like the
[1:06:05] sister used to saying get in the ark and
[1:06:06] stay there Hallelujah and be ready when
[1:06:09] Jesus come come on you got to stay
[1:06:11] behind the blood now if you get out from

[1:06:16] you you on your own but if you stay
[1:06:18] behind the blood oh Jesus no matter how
[1:06:22] hard times get Hallelujah no matter how
[1:06:25] rough the situation get no matter how
[1:06:27] much the politics of America fall apart
[1:06:30] God is going to bless you Hallelujah why
[1:06:33] because you covered by the blood oh
[1:06:35] Jesus I believe that this morning come
[1:06:38] on but what it what it is God gets us to
[1:06:41] those times don't he come on I want to
[1:06:43] say this morning you in God's hands
[1:06:45] right amen come on Israel Israel was at
[1:06:47] a place I believe uh of of identity
[1:06:50] crisis we can call it come on cuz
[1:06:53] sometimes they forgot who they were
[1:06:55] serving right so what God would always
[1:06:57] do Hallelujah is bring judgment wouldn't
[1:07:00] he come on he don't do it because he
[1:07:02] just want to be bring judgment he do it
[1:07:05] because he love you right come on you
[1:07:07] belong to God he ain't going to let you
[1:07:09] go Hallelujah he might put up with
[1:07:11] certain things for a while but after
[1:07:13] that little while is over with God going
[1:07:15] to call one day Hallelujah and you going
[1:07:19] to have to answer that call ain't you
[1:07:21] I'm so glad that God called me
[1:07:23] Hallelujah though I might not want to
[1:07:26] listen I'm glad that God called me oh
[1:07:28] Jesus Hallelujah but what happens like
[1:07:32] it says that even in that time come on
[1:07:34] uh her Jeremiah I mean Isaiah
[1:07:36] prophesying to him now we know that you
[1:07:39] know he was talking about Jesus was
[1:07:40] going to fulfill this part come on
[1:07:42] coming and and I like how in Luke 4
[1:07:45] Jesus when he came in the temple he
[1:07:47] begin to to read the scripture where it
[1:07:48] said in Isaiah he he said the spirit of
[1:07:51] the Lord is upon me right cuz he have
[1:07:53] anointed me come on to preach the gospel
[1:07:56] come on to bring Good Tidings Hallelujah
[1:07:58] the men the Broken Heart come on set
[1:08:00] free those that are captive something
[1:08:03] about God right God comes and he comes
[1:08:05] for deliverance I like how Isaiah say
[1:08:08] says here he says that God heard you in
[1:08:11] an acceptable Time come on come onen God
[1:08:15] heard you didn't he in an acceptable
[1:08:18] time Hallelujah one thing about it
[1:08:21] sometimes we don't think that God hear
[1:08:23] us come on because look like God showed
[1:08:26] up right then but God is moving the
[1:08:28] whole time ain't he come on I said you
[1:08:30] in his hands this morning but we find
[1:08:33] that you know they they came to that
[1:08:35] place right and and they begin to like
[1:08:39] we say that sometimes have an identity
[1:08:40] crisis but God want to show that
[1:08:42] Hallelujah help was on the way right
[1:08:45] come on they know that they didn't know
[1:08:47] probably they was going to go down to
[1:08:48] Babylon and being bondage and all those
[1:08:50] things but even in all that come on no
[1:08:52] matter where you at you in God's hand
[1:08:54] come on amen help is on the way right
[1:08:58] but then uh they they begin to say Lord
[1:09:01] uh like you said Zion uh begin to say
[1:09:03] that the Lord forgot them come on I said
[1:09:05] God ain't going to forget you this
[1:09:06] morning amen begin to say that the that
[1:09:09] the Lord forgot them when they going
[1:09:11] through how many people feel like that
[1:09:12] sometimes that the Lord forgot you come
[1:09:15] on when you going through but he wanted
[1:09:18] to remind them Hallelujah and I'm so
[1:09:21] glad this morning Hallelujah that when
[1:09:23] we forget God remind us sometime come on
[1:09:27] that you belong to me
[1:09:29] Hallelujah come on this didn't just
[1:09:31] start now right as we were saying the
[1:09:34] other week but before the foundation of
[1:09:36] the world Hallelujah he already placed
[1:09:38] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life you
[1:09:40] didn't realize what God was doing with
[1:09:43] your life but he knew what he was doing
[1:09:45] the whole time hallelujah oh Jesus come
[1:09:48] on but he begin to tell him he said God
[1:09:51] forgotten about him forgotten us right
[1:09:54] but he asked him a question
[1:09:56] and this was deep wasn't it he said can
[1:09:59] a can a woman right forget her suckling

[1:12:58] come back leave you and run off God

[1:13:52] tomorrow come on come on I believe God
[1:13:54] wants some ch children like that come on
[1:13:56] but to realize like we said that that
[1:13:58] you in God's hands one thing about it
[1:14:01] when he was talking about this mother
[1:14:03] here right and forgetting her child I
[1:14:06] says sometimes we misunderstand God's
[1:14:09] love right because we thinking about it
[1:14:13] first off like humans do right come on
[1:14:17] cuz we can't help ourselves right but to
[1:14:21] understand that the love of God it
[1:14:23] supersedes anything we can ever imagine
[1:14:26] come on God's love supersedes anything
[1:14:30] that we can ever imagine come on God
[1:14:33] loves goes to the unlovable right we
[1:14:37] can't even imagine sometimes the The
[1:14:39] Depths that God go through the save
[1:14:41] people right amen amen sometimes we look
[1:14:44] at people might say oh they they they
[1:14:47] done they washed up but God love
[1:14:49] supersedes anything that we can ever
[1:14:51] think of right amen amen God's love go
[1:14:54] down
[1:14:55] to the prison house Hallelujah God's
[1:14:58] love will go by the hospital won't it
[1:15:00] God's love will go to the crack house to
[1:15:03] the liquor store God's love go by and
[1:15:06] see about that prostitute God's love
[1:15:09] supersedes anything that we can think
[1:15:11] about don't it come on it does so we get
[1:15:15] confused sometime don't we come on we
[1:15:18] get confused but I said the thing about
[1:15:20] it is you know to understand that's why
[1:15:23] he he begin to to give them that that's
[1:15:25] saying uh about the woman forgetting her
[1:15:28] her suckling child because that seemed
[1:15:30] to be almost impossible but he said that
[1:15:32] she can do that but I can't never forget
[1:15:34] you right come on devil be all in your
[1:15:37] ear God can't never forget you amen you
[1:15:40] might not want to recognize God but he
[1:15:42] know you right where you're at God you
[1:15:45] in God's hands ain't it come on I think
[1:15:48] about Joseph Hallelujah let's talk about
[1:15:50] him for a little bit right Joseph was in
[1:15:52] God's hand wasn't he he might have
[1:15:55] thought that you know sometimes we don't
[1:15:57] understand why we going through I'm a
[1:15:59] good Christian right come on I pay my ti
[1:16:02] I do what the good things but then the
[1:16:05] winds begin to blow right just because
[1:16:08] the winds are blowing remember you still
[1:16:10] in God's hand right come
[1:16:12] on people jealous of you hate you right
[1:16:17] false accused him didn't throw them in a
[1:16:20] pit and sold them into slavery that's
[1:16:23] hard to believe that I'm still in God's
[1:16:24] hand right come on but don't you know
[1:16:27] even in all that he was in God's hands
[1:16:30] even in all that God might have
[1:16:32] permitted certain things right but the
[1:16:35] devil couldn't do no more than what God
[1:16:37] allowed Hallelujah and when God was
[1:16:40] going to call a storm up he had to stop
[1:16:42] didn't he come on I said that this
[1:16:45] morning you know one thing about it the
[1:16:47] devil can't do no more than what God
[1:16:49] allow right come on Amen you in God's
[1:16:52] hands the devil can't do no more than
[1:16:54] what God than what God allow come on and
[1:16:57] all of that I can see Joseph in the end
[1:16:59] looking back right knowing Hallelujah
[1:17:04] that the path that he took right knowing
[1:17:07] that the mountains and the and the
[1:17:09] valleys and the Low Places right amen
[1:17:12] and all those things I can see him tell
[1:17:14] his brothers it wasn't you but it was
[1:17:17] God hallelujah amen I am what I am
[1:17:20] because of God brought me here you
[1:17:22] didn't send me but I was in God's hand
[1:17:25] amen hallelujah I couldn't see his great
[1:17:27] plan but I know that I was in his hands
[1:17:30] Hallelujah and God showed up didn't he
[1:17:32] come on but it's one thing about that
[1:17:34] like we says God is faithful this
[1:17:36] morning Hallelujah it says one thing
[1:17:38] about it you know uh uh he's talking
[1:17:40] here he was reminding them come on that
[1:17:43] that you might be in a a certain place
[1:17:46] right now or certain going through
[1:17:48] certain things right now but it ain't
[1:17:50] going to always be like that come on

[1:17:54] always that way amen come on I don't
[1:17:56] know about you but I'm on the up and up
[1:17:58] side now come on all right I'm thinking
[1:18:01] positive I'm on the up and up
[1:18:03] side like they sometimes you don't know
[1:18:06] the meaning of of certain script of
[1:18:07] certain songs until you're going through
[1:18:09] heavily right then God whisper that song
[1:18:12] in your ear Hallelujah God whisper that
[1:18:14] scripture in your ear then you can start
[1:18:16] that can become your daily bread right
[1:18:19] Hallelujah that I know my deliverer
[1:18:20] coming Hallelujah that can be your daily
[1:18:23] bread come on that I never the righteous
[1:18:25] forsaken nor is seed begging for bread
[1:18:27] won't let these things come out of my
[1:18:29] mouth I know Hallelujah why because God
[1:18:31] has given me the victory come on yes he
[1:18:34] has Hallelujah I like that how David

[1:18:58] might get through the first Storm come
[1:19:00] on you might even make it through the

[1:19:04] going to knock you out the only thing
[1:19:07] that's going to hold you up Hallelujah
[1:19:09] come on you got to be built on a firm
[1:19:11] foundation amen got to be held up by the
