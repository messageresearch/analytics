[40:04] the book of genesis 4
[40:08] praise god
[40:12] genesis 4
[40:18] and 9. it says and the lord
[40:22] said unto a cain where is abel thy
[40:25] brother
[40:26] and he said i know not am i
[40:31] my brother's keeper and he said
[40:36] what has now done the voice
[40:40] of thy brother blood cries unto me
[40:45] from the ground may god bless you read
[40:47] this word you may be seated
[40:50] this morning we want to share with you
[40:53] the voice of the blood
[40:56] the voice of the blood the blood speaks
[40:59] amen
[41:00] and in hebrews here
[41:04] hebrews 11
[41:07] hebrews 11 the voice of the blood
[41:12] he said here now
[41:16] faith is the substance of things hoped
[41:18] for
[41:19] it is the evidence of things not seen
[41:22] for by it the elders attain a good
[41:25] report
[41:27] through faith we understand that the
[41:29] words were framed
[41:31] by the word of god so that the things
[41:34] which
[41:35] are seen were not made by the things
[41:38] which do appear
[41:40] by faith ava offered
[41:44] unto god a more excellent sacrifice
[41:48] than cain and by which he attained
[41:52] witness that he was righteous
[41:55] god testifying of
[41:58] his guilt and by
[42:02] it he being dead
[42:07] listen to this he being what
[42:10] but yet i said the blood
[42:14] speaks he said i heard
[42:18] i heard the voice see
[42:21] it's something about the blood
[42:25] that it can speak
[42:28] we know leviticus tell us the life of
[42:31] the flesh is in the blood
[42:34] are you with me so we realize that
[42:39] the body without the spirit is dead amen
[42:45] but we understand that there's a
[42:47] chemistry blood
[42:49] but there was uh a a light that was in
[42:52] that blood
[42:56] and we when we speak of the blood of
[42:58] jesus we're talking about the
[43:00] that god created himself
[43:04] a body when god created that body amen
[43:11] that he was able to get in
[43:15] to that body in the virgin
[43:19] the seed in the egg
[43:22] it was created and that's why amen
[43:26] in action talks about
[43:29] the blood of god
[43:32] so that blood without it
[43:36] you know some folks say the blood of two
[43:38] thousand years ago
[43:39] is not for us today
[43:42] but the blood has never
[43:46] lost its power he said when doctors shed
[43:49] in the blood
[43:50] there is no forgiveness of sin
[43:54] are you with man see i you know i don't
[43:58] understand how
[43:59] folks amen can amen
[44:02] uh account the blood of jesus
[44:05] amen that it does not it's not affected
[44:09] for us today
[44:12] but i believe that the blood still
[44:14] speaks
[44:17] the book of hebrews 12.
[44:22] the blood still speaks it speaks on our
[44:25] behalf
[44:27] amen the bible tells us how he offered
[44:31] himself
[44:32] to god through the eternal spirit
[44:37] praise god
[44:42] see without the spirit
[44:47] the same blood that jesus said that life
[44:50] that was in that blood could come back
[44:52] on the believer
[44:54] are you with me the spirit that was in
[44:58] jesus that same spirit
[45:02] that same god can come back and
[45:06] tabernacle
[45:07] in us
[45:11] that's why we are sons and daughters of
[45:13] god
[45:15] that's our connection
[45:18] amen we cannot be connected with god
[45:21] without the blood
[45:24] how can you be a son or daughter of god
[45:27] if you're not
[45:28] his seed amen
[45:32] because we are his gene seed
[45:36] amen by the word of god
[45:41] we've been born again not of corruptible
[45:43] seed but

[46:02] praise god he said the words that are
[46:04] speaking to you their spirit in their
[46:06] life
[46:08] praise god so god word gives you life
[46:12] what the word of god you have no life
[46:16] without the blood of jesus there's no
[46:18] forgiveness of sin
[46:21] that's why he said repent be baptized
[46:24] every one of you
[46:26] in the name of jesus christ for the
[46:28] remission of sin
[46:29] and you shall receive the gift of the
[46:31] holy ghost
[46:32] the holy ghost comes to obedience to the
[46:35] word
[46:37] amen praise god he that believeth on me
[46:40] as the structure has said
[46:42] then out of his belly shall flow rivers
[46:45] of living water
[46:47] man can't give you the holy ghost the
[46:49] church can't give you the holy ghost
[46:50] the bishop can't give you the holy ghost
[46:53] but jesus
[46:55] because of his blood he gives us the
[46:58] holy ghost
[47:00] you know sometimes folks say i got i
[47:03] i have the spirit and sometimes i think
[47:05] it's just a defense
[47:08] sometimes i think they they got to put
[47:10] up a god to convince somebody
[47:12] that i i really got it then sometimes
[47:16] they have to speak in tongues a little
[47:17] bit and
[47:18] jump a little bit and try to prove that
[47:20] you got it
[47:22] praise god but jesus didn't have to
[47:24] prove anything to anybody
[47:26] amen he was the son of god amen
[47:29] praise god and he said if you don't
[47:32] believe that i'm here you're dying in
[47:33] sin
[47:35] are you up man praise god
[47:38] folks are condemned already because they
[47:40] believe not
[47:42] are you with me but if they believe amen
[47:45] they can be saved
[47:47] amen they can be delivered folks amen in
[47:51] this hour the people of
[47:53] mindset look like they're in another
[47:55] world
[47:56] amen just preach the
[48:00] funeral yesterday 18 year old
[48:03] and you can see all the young people he
[48:05] got shot four times
[48:09] and to see all the young people from the
[48:12] high school and every
[48:13] thing there was hundreds there
[48:17] and hundreds online
[48:23] and i said the young people today
[48:26] believe that they
[48:28] are just spiritual
[48:31] they are their own god
[48:34] they are able to speak
[48:38] what they want they don't want to come
[48:42] under
[48:42] suggestion that the bible is the word of
[48:45] god
[48:47] man should not live by bread alone but
[48:49] by every word
[48:51] that proceeded out of the mouth of god
[48:54] amen see sometimes folk
[48:58] amen will have you to think
[49:02] that their word is more effective than
[49:06] the bible
[49:08] than the word of god but i tell you the
[49:10] word of god
[49:11] it's gone out of his mouth and it shall
[49:14] accomplish
[49:16] that which he sent it to do brother and
[49:19] sister
[49:20] i find no fault in the word
[49:23] what about you pilar said i found no
[49:26] fault in the man
[49:28] but yet he had to crucify him because he
[49:31] had to
[49:31] do what the people wanted the people
[49:34] wanted it so he gave
[49:36] he he wanted to please the people and
[49:38] sometimes we're
[49:39] interested in pleasing people but
[49:43] you got to understand that the blood of
[49:45] jesus
[49:46] speaks for you are you up there
[49:50] amen now every devil in hell
[49:53] can come against you amen but jesus
[49:57] through the blood
[49:59] that he shined through the crowds the
[50:01] bible said he's trampling
[50:03] over them in it praise god he rose
[50:08] dropping victoriously over that hell in
[50:12] the grave
[50:14] pray amen when he said it was finished
[50:16] that means your sins and
[50:18] mine you know
[50:21] there's something wrong somewhere when a
[50:24] person can be forgiven
[50:27] and can be set free and can have eternal
[50:30] life and they turn it down
[50:31] something wrong somewhere but yet if you
[50:34] offer them a million dollars they'll run
[50:36] and jump in and get it
[50:38] and be happy as can be but you give them
[50:40] eternal life
[50:41] and they they don't want it
[50:44] the devil offered them a quick fix of
[50:47] something out there in the world
[50:48] and they they're running for it they're
[50:51] enjoying that
[50:55] amen and they won't give jesus left
[50:58] everything
[50:58] to come down and shed his blood he left
[51:01] heaven
[51:03] to come down and take on sinful flesh in
[51:06] the likeness of sinful flesh
[51:09] come down to die on the cross and be
[51:11] spit on
[51:12] and to be rejected despised and rejected
[51:15] of men
[51:16] a man of sorrow and acquainted with
[51:17] grief
[51:19] he came down to do all of that for us
[51:22] and we sat around
[51:23] and though god had done anything
[51:26] and you know i it's something wrong with
[51:29] the love that the people have for god i
[51:31] believe
[51:32] that they don't really love him
[51:36] even christian folk unsaved folk they
[51:39] don't love
[51:40] god like the altar you know i i find out
[51:46] you can preach on folk how to dress and
[51:48] how to do this and
[51:50] stop doing this and stop doing that but
[51:52] if you're all
[51:53] if they only love god you wouldn't have
[51:55] no problem
[51:58] you have no problem when they really
[51:59] love god
[52:01] but the the problem is
[52:04] that folk have not they men
[52:07] caught a revelation they don't really
[52:10] love god they don't realize
[52:12] how what god has done for them

[52:21] to
[52:23] get people to stop doing this and live
[52:25] this
[52:26] live for god and all of that and you're
[52:28] wasting your time
[52:30] if they don't love god you know it's
[52:34] something
[52:35] that a man gonna be faithful to his wife
[52:37] he don't love her
[52:41] it's something that that a father gon

[1:01:44] knowing why amen what you come for
[1:01:47] you're coming to expectation

[1:02:10] innumerable company of angels
[1:02:12] if we only knew if we can look into the
[1:02:15] unseen and look into that
[1:02:16] other dimension and see that the angels
[1:02:18] of god are here
[1:02:21] as elijah said to
[1:02:24] i don't don't mind the syrian army
[1:02:27] don't mind what's around you amen no
[1:02:29] matter all the devils and all that that

[1:02:44] amen all your problems and all that
[1:02:46] you've been through and all
[1:02:48] that you're going through don't look at
[1:02:49] that look until the unseen
[1:02:51] look into the word that they that's with
[1:02:53] us are more than them that is against us
[1:02:57] amen you come to amen an innumerable
[1:03:00] a company of angels amen praise god
[1:03:05] when you're looking at that amen it
[1:03:07] takes a revelation it takes
[1:03:09] faith to look into the unseen
[1:03:12] amen what faith is all about faith is
[1:03:14] something that things hope for
[1:03:16] and it's the evidence of things what not
[1:03:19] seeing you don't have to see it to
[1:03:20] believe it
[1:03:21] why because you believe it and you see
[1:03:23] it
[1:03:26] are you with me praise god that's what
[1:03:29] it's all about brother
[1:03:30] you're coming to an enumerable company
[1:03:32] of angels but if you don't believe the
[1:03:34] angels of god
[1:03:35] i hear you would conduct yourself as
[1:03:38] that servant you'll be a fearful
[1:03:42] you what what are your feet known you're
[1:03:44] feeding on your fear
[1:03:46] amen and and you won't be able to defeat
[1:03:49] the devil
[1:03:50] until you amen look beyond
[1:03:54] praise god your fears and looking to the
[1:03:58] unseen
[1:03:58] and see amen that he's a present help
[1:04:02] in the time of trouble are you with me
[1:04:05] that god is here it said i'll never
[1:04:07] leave you i'll never forsake you but
[1:04:09] i'll be with you always
[1:04:12] knowing that you have a god that's god
[1:04:15] praise god hallelujah he's with us
[1:04:19] if god be with us then what
[1:04:22] who can be what what are you worried
[1:04:25] about who can lay anything to charge of
[1:04:28] god's election
[1:04:29] amen amen if god is here
[1:04:33] oh lord i'm running for my life
[1:04:37] amen amen it says here
[1:04:41] and the 23rd verse it says until the
[1:04:44] general assembly and the what
[1:04:47] church of the what praise god
[1:04:50] isn't that good the church of the first
[1:04:53] born
[1:04:54] amen
[1:04:58] which are written in heaven don't you
[1:05:01] know
[1:05:02] your name was written on the lamb book
[1:05:04] of life before when
[1:05:07] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:10] if god wrote your name on the lamb book
[1:05:11] of life before the foundation of the
[1:05:13] world that means he foreknew you
[1:05:16] and god saw you amen why because the
[1:05:18] lamb was slain in the mind of god before
[1:05:20] the foundation of the world
[1:05:22] isn't that right so he's showing you
[1:05:24] that there was a bloody lamb in the mind
[1:05:25] of god so jesus had
[1:05:27] come and john said behold the lamb of
[1:05:29] god that take away what
[1:05:32] amen so if that happened then there was
[1:05:35] a reason why the lamb was slain he was
[1:05:37] slain for you
[1:05:39] are you what man and god can he can put
[1:05:42] your name there
[1:05:42] amen on that lamb book of life
[1:05:46] because he foreknew you he knew that one
[1:05:49] day you would believe that god so you
[1:05:51] would believe
[1:05:51] that he bled and died for you
[1:05:56] and believing you will receive eternal
[1:05:58] life
[1:06:00] only because you had it in the mind of
[1:06:02] god
[1:06:04] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:06] that's the reason why you could believe
[1:06:09] because god saw you coming

[1:07:03] why should i fear why should i
[1:07:06] you know why should we
[1:07:09] you know it's difficult sometimes when
[1:07:12] we're going through tough times to
[1:07:14] really release
[1:07:15] and give it to god so god you
[1:07:20] you can carry my burdens sometimes you
[1:07:23] get a little difficult a little hard
[1:07:24] to bear i looked at that family
[1:07:28] that mother that lost son murdered and
[1:07:31] so forth and i looked at the young
[1:07:34] people and
[1:07:35] my heart just old yarn always
[1:07:38] hundreds and hundreds of young people i
[1:07:41] say god
[1:07:43] see they and you know that they
[1:07:47] they're so out there
[1:07:51] and somebody said i think my wife or
[1:07:52] somebody's
[1:07:55] my sister-in-law those these young
[1:07:57] people don't have nobody
[1:07:59] nobody to guard them show them away
[1:08:03] for most of them
[1:08:06] mothers were teenagers when they had
[1:08:09] these children
[1:08:12] and i think brother gardner somebody
[1:08:14] said 60 percent of the black
[1:08:16] children are born out of weight loss
[1:08:20] back then statistically
[1:08:25] so what is what is going on
[1:08:28] when you're speaking you know
[1:08:32] they're killing one another
[1:08:35] they're selling drugs to one another are
[1:08:38] you with me
[1:08:40] what makes it what makes you not a
[1:08:42] victim as a young person this morning
[1:08:47] somebody loves you enough to tell you
[1:08:49] the truth
[1:08:52] love you enough to say don't go that way
[1:08:56] don't go down that road but what what is
[1:08:59] it but
[1:09:01] 90 of the youth are going down that road
[1:09:04] maybe 95
[1:09:07] what's going to keep you what's going to
[1:09:08] hold you
[1:09:12] only the mercy of god in the love of god
[1:09:14] if you only receive it
[1:09:17] if you only recognize that he loves me
[1:09:21] amen god loves me i i got friends and i
[1:09:26] and they'll pull it on me but oh lord
[1:09:30] what the blood of jesus
[1:09:34] i'll tell you the truth i don't care who
[1:09:36] don't believe
[1:09:37] that that he shed his blood for them but
[1:09:40] i'm so glad he shed it
[1:09:42] for me because i know where i was
[1:09:46] and i know where i could have been and i
[1:09:47] would have been if jesus didn't save me
[1:09:51] but i'm so glad he did praise god
[1:09:56] you know i i you know it's been 40
[1:09:59] something years you know i i never
[1:10:01] wanted to go back
[1:10:04] you know a young young boy
[1:10:08] i never wanted to go back
[1:10:12] now i'm an old man but i never wanted to
[1:10:14] go back i don't know what's going
[1:10:16] on with people well it's so hard it went
[1:10:18] hard
[1:10:21] it was not hard i would tell you yeah we
[1:10:24] could
[1:10:24] go through some difficult times and
[1:10:26] battles and all that
[1:10:27] but it wasn't hard like the bible said
[1:10:30] the wages of
[1:10:31] sin i mean the way of a transgression is
[1:10:34] what
[1:10:36] hard you know and
[1:10:39] sin if man when the devil gets to
[1:10:43] beating you
[1:10:44] i said we gonna have some testimonies in
[1:10:46] here
[1:10:47] because the devil doesn't whip up on
[1:10:49] some people
[1:10:52] you think you big and you bad and you
[1:10:54] know what you want
[1:10:56] and you know what you can do the devil
[1:10:58] said yeah
[1:10:59] tell him he'll push you up that you big
[1:11:02] and bad and tough
[1:11:04] and you ain't gonna do this and you
[1:11:06] ain't gonna do that tell them you ain't
[1:11:08] gonna never do it yet
[1:11:10] without god the devil make you do it
[1:11:16] are you with me you got
[1:11:19] you no match for the devil he'll make
[1:11:22] you do what you said you'll never do
[1:11:28] but i'm so glad that god's mercy
[1:11:31] and the love of god he came and got me
[1:11:34] as a young man he came and got me
[1:11:38] i was telling you know as a young man he
[1:11:41] came and had mercy on my life
[1:11:44] you know i love him because of what he's
[1:11:46] done for me
[1:11:49] and as a young man in the early 20s i'm
[1:11:51] dealing with demons and devils and
[1:11:54] witchcraft and all kind of spirits and
[1:11:56] all kind of power
[1:11:57] but i said oh lord look what i'm dealing
[1:11:59] with
[1:12:00] i got to cast out devils i got to see
[1:12:05] people like snakes and like dogs and
[1:12:08] rallying
[1:12:09] and women growling like men and all i
[1:12:12] said oh i'm in another world
[1:12:15] is this real it's real if the devil can
[1:12:19] get a hold of you
[1:12:21] he'll possess you and he'll take you so
[1:12:24] far
[1:12:24] to you you'll be out of this world
[1:12:29] you'll be in another world i tell you
[1:12:33] that devil can take you
[1:12:34] farther than where you want to go are
[1:12:37] you with me
[1:12:38] so you when you have a chance to accept
[1:12:41] jesus christ
[1:12:43] and to live for god you need to do that
[1:12:46] you need it with all your mighty lord
[1:12:50] maybe i i under appreciate it
[1:12:53] i undervalue your love
[1:12:57] and i under appreciated what your blood
[1:12:59] means to me
[1:13:02] but yet your blood speaks the voice of
[1:13:05] the blood
[1:13:07] the life that was in the blood yet you
[1:13:10] wanted to give your life
[1:13:11] that i can have life
[1:13:15] amen that i can live brother how
[1:13:18] precious
[1:13:19] sister how precious is that somebody to
[1:13:22] care more about you than you kept
[1:13:25] then you could ever care about yourself
[1:13:28] enough to share
[1:13:29] eternity with you said i share eternity
[1:13:32] with you
[1:13:33] i want you to be my bride i want you to
[1:13:35] be amen
[1:13:38] i want you to be the lamb's wife amen
[1:13:41] are you with me so he extends his
[1:13:44] grace towards us
[1:13:51] it says here it says and god
[1:13:59] written in heaven and god the judge of
[1:14:02] all
[1:14:03] and to the spirit of just men made what
[1:14:07] just being made perfect and to jesus to
[1:14:11] what
[1:14:13] the mediator of the what the new
[1:14:16] covenant
[1:14:18] and the blood of what that speaketh what
[1:14:24] the blood speaks better things than
[1:14:28] i want revenge
[1:14:31] i eye for an eye and two foot two
[1:14:35] because if jesus would have his blood
[1:14:38] would have spoke like that
[1:14:40] he said i hear the voice of your brother
[1:14:41] blood speaking
[1:14:45] those are done under the altar they
[1:14:47] cried out how long
[1:14:49] they cried out will you avenge us
[1:14:54] see what i'm saying but the blood of
[1:14:56] jesus didn't speak
[1:14:58] concerning vengeance are you with me
[1:15:03] but he spoke concerning forgiveness
[1:15:07] amen i forgive you that's what the blood
[1:15:10] of jesus
[1:15:11] does it forgives and if that life that
[1:15:15] was in that blood
[1:15:16] comes down in you then you would have
[1:15:19] that same one
[1:15:21] same spirit that you're able to forgive
[1:15:26] are you with me but if you don't have
[1:15:29] that spirit you can't forgive people
[1:15:32] you know some of the things i've been
[1:15:35] through as a christian
[1:15:37] and people say why didn't you retaliate
[1:15:41] because the blood wouldn't let me
[1:15:44] amen and because it wasn't in me to do
[1:15:48] it
[1:15:49] i could not retaliate when you know
[1:15:51] somebody's lying on you
[1:15:52] and you know somebody's doing you wrong
[1:15:54] but yet you can take it why
[1:15:56] because of the blood are you with me
[1:16:01] you know most folk can't take it because
[1:16:04] the blood has not been applied
[1:16:07] if the blood has not been applied then
[1:16:10] you're gonna go
[1:16:11] somebody do you wrong oh not me i'll
[1:16:13] fight oh lord
[1:16:15] but when the blood speaks if you have
[1:16:18] the holy ghost and you have the
[1:16:19] the life of jesus inside of you if
[1:16:22] you've been forgiven then you know how
[1:16:24] to forgive
[1:16:26] are you with me forgiveness make a
[1:16:29] difference you forgive them
[1:16:32] because what they
[1:16:35] know not amen brother if i hurt you
[1:16:40] forgive me because i didn't mean it
[1:16:44] i didn't know it oh you wouldn't be
[1:16:47] how can you hold me and hold something
[1:16:49] on me that i didn't know
[1:16:53] are you with me folks will hold you down
[1:16:56] to something you don't even know nothing
[1:16:57] about it
[1:16:58] and they thinking oh and they hold
[1:17:02] on to it for years and years and you
[1:17:04] never knew they were holding on to it
[1:17:07] i've had some folks come and they said
[1:17:10] you know
[1:17:10] so and someone did something to me 20
[1:17:13] years ago
[1:17:16] and i never went rock around that person
[1:17:21] i said lord have mercy i said that
[1:17:24] person would say
[1:17:25] did that person know no
[1:17:29] they didn't know and you mean to tell me
[1:17:31] you
[1:17:32] separated yourself from a brother or
[1:17:34] sister sometimes from parents
[1:17:36] and all that people have separated
[1:17:39] yourself from their mamas and their
[1:17:40] daddies
[1:17:41] because they was holding something that
[1:17:42] their parents thought
[1:17:44] am i i said lord
[1:17:49] shouldn't you go to them i mean you know
[1:17:51] sometimes you can have
[1:17:53] you can be counseling ministers and all
[1:17:55] and they can be holy stuff
[1:17:57] in their heart and you need to tell
[1:18:00] people forgive
[1:18:02] the blood what speaks
[1:18:06] the blood speaks of forgiveness and you
[1:18:09] never sat down and talked about what
[1:18:11] you're going through
[1:18:15] if you would only talk about what you're
[1:18:18] going through
[1:18:24] you could have got the victory
[1:18:27] are you with me but you're hell in the
[1:18:29] end and you're suffering
[1:18:32] praise god you suffered for holding it
[1:18:34] in
[1:18:35] brother and sister you need to tell that
[1:18:38] brother that sister that person
[1:18:41] forgive me amen forgive me
[1:18:45] because i held on to something and you
[1:18:48] then when you come to find out the
[1:18:50] prophet said you find out
[1:18:52] that it wasn't nothing but the devil
[1:18:56] you said what all this time
[1:19:01] and i could have had a precious friend
[1:19:03] or sister

[1:19:24] forgiveness
[1:19:26] it speaks i forgive you amen
