[17:22] the 12th verse
[17:32] romans 14 and 12. we got it say amen
[17:37] and it reads let's let's begin here at
[17:40] the
[17:40] at the 10th verse
[17:44] and it reads but why does thou judge thy
[17:47] brother
[17:47] why does thou set and not thy brother
[17:51] for we shall all stand before the
[17:54] judgment seat of christ
[17:56] for it is written as i live saith the
[17:59] lord every knee shall bow to me
[18:02] and every tongue shall confess to god so
[18:05] then every one of us
[18:06] all every one of us shall give account
[18:09] to
[18:10] of himself to god let us not therefore
[18:14] judge one another anymore but judge this
[18:16] rather
[18:17] no man put a stumbling block on occasion
[18:20] to fall
[18:21] in in his brother's way may god bless
[18:24] you arena of his word you may be seated
[18:27] this morning by god's grace just for a
[18:29] moment i want to minister to you
[18:31] on a topic on that day amen
[18:34] on that day now we know that here you
[18:37] know
[18:38] paul was addressing some things you know
[18:40] a lot of dressing with dealing with
[18:42] certain things you eat and
[18:44] all these things and clean and unclean
[18:46] but you know i just want to look here at
[18:49] how you know he says
[18:52] you know to the people you're saying you
[18:54] know i don't want you to judge
[18:56] you know your brother or say that not in
[18:59] one another anymore
[19:00] he says because the days what's going to
[19:03] come he said that we all was going to
[19:05] have to stand before the judgment seat
[19:06] of god
[19:07] and he says that when you stand before
[19:10] the judgment seat of god every man was
[19:12] going to have to give an account
[19:13] come on for his own life how many
[19:16] believe that this morning
[19:17] so i says you know he was saying you
[19:19] know don't
[19:21] a man have to answer for himself you
[19:23] know sometimes
[19:24] we look at like we said on that day you
[19:27] know we look at sometimes
[19:29] as a minister you know uh or even as a
[19:33] christian
[19:34] sometimes you get frustrated i say it
[19:36] like that
[19:37] when people make bad decisions or you
[19:40] see people
[19:41] do things that's unlike the word of god
[19:44] or you see
[19:45] people make decisions that you know that
[19:47] god doesn't like
[19:48] sometimes it frustrates you come on
[19:51] because
[19:52] of the scene of the other reason it
[19:54] frustrates you
[19:55] or it hurts you because you love that
[19:57] person come on
[19:59] and you looking not just necessarily at
[20:02] the decision that they made
[20:04] but you're looking at the after effects
[20:07] or the long-term consequence
[20:09] consequences that that person will have
[20:11] to face
[20:12] because of the decision they made and
[20:14] sometimes
[20:15] we can that we've been through certain
[20:18] things in life
[20:19] even you try to tell your children
[20:21] sometimes because you've been there come
[20:23] on
[20:24] and you know what the outcome is going
[20:25] to be so it hurts you sometimes
[20:28] when you see them make certain decisions
[20:31] or go down certain paths
[20:33] so you might sometimes fuss at them or
[20:36] do other things but it ain't out of
[20:38] it ain't out of because you judging them
[20:41] or don't like them but it's because of
[20:42] love come on
[20:44] you know the bible jesus said one place
[20:46] he says many he love he
[20:48] do what he rebuke and he chasteneth you
[20:50] know
[20:51] oh how god loves us that he don't let us
[20:55] stay in the condition we are and
[20:56] sin and wall in it but he'll he'll do
[20:59] things to us to chastise us and all
[21:01] because he loves us
[21:03] you know they they sing a song he meant
[21:05] it for my good come on
[21:08] the devil meant it for bad but i'm so
[21:10] glad that god meant it for my good
[21:12] come on we look at the sometimes the
[21:14] chastisement or the present sufferings
[21:16] and all these things and
[21:17] we wonder why but we know that they're
[21:19] not to be compared to the glory that god
[21:22] is going to reveal in you
[21:24] when when when the end is come come on
[21:27] when god is done with you then you could
[21:29] look back
[21:30] like joseph when he looked at his
[21:32] brothers he said yes you did it for evil
[21:34] and he says i
[21:34] i might have been through some things
[21:36] come on i might have had to suffer some
[21:38] hardships but he says god
[21:39] meant it for good come on i can see the
[21:42] hand of the lord in it all
[21:43] come on and that's what it is you don't
[21:46] just uh
[21:47] come into a maturity i believe that
[21:49] overnight
[21:51] but it's a road it's a path to some
[21:53] places that god
[21:54] takes you to get you to that place of
[21:57] maturity
[21:58] to get you to that place of character
[22:00] where he can set you up to rule
[22:02] how many believe that this morning but i
[22:04] says that that's why sometimes
[22:06] it hurts you you know because of love
[22:09] and i was told
[22:10] many times on many occasions that that
[22:13] you know i was too sensitive come on
[22:15] or i get too emotional i get too uh
[22:18] in intertwined with others and i says
[22:22] you know i can't i can't help it
[22:23] sometimes come on
[22:25] because in my heart i want to see
[22:27] everybody make it
[22:28] in my heart i want to see everybody save
[22:30] come on and i believe that if you're a
[22:32] real christian today you don't have to
[22:34] just be a minister but that would be in
[22:36] your heart as well
[22:37] not to look down on one another but to
[22:40] always
[22:40] be in prayer for somebody come on lord
[22:43] they might have fallen but god help them
[22:45] get back up
[22:46] lord though their foot fell lord help
[22:48] them to find that place of stability
[22:50] come on
[22:51] lord don't let them perish come on sign
[22:54] crime brother abomination done in the
[22:56] city
[22:57] not god bring judgment but god have
[22:59] mercy
[23:00] god forgive them lord open their eyes to
[23:02] the condition that they're in
[23:04] and help them lord to see the light come
[23:06] on how many want
[23:08] that this morning so we find that i said
[23:10] on that day
[23:12] come on i said you know as a minister
[23:14] you you it bothers you
[23:16] sometimes but you know you realize that
[23:19] it's your job and not only as a minister
[23:22] but as
[23:22] the head of your household and your
[23:24] order over your children
[23:26] all that as a brother or sister it's
[23:28] your job
[23:29] to do what to to preach the word i'll
[23:33] say that
[23:34] in season and out of season come on give
[23:36] the people the word of god
[23:37] come on let them know so then you know
[23:41] it says but overall the choice they make
[23:44] is going to be between them and god
[23:47] i thought about ministering a sermon
[23:48] once between you and god
[23:50] because in the end you know we can give
[23:54] you the word come on
[23:55] we can lay all these things before you
[23:58] but
[23:59] the choice that you make when it's laid
[24:01] before you is going to be between you
[24:03] and god in the end somebody said that
[24:06] them and god got something worked out
[24:07] well that's between you and god come on
[24:10] but i know one thing
[24:12] come on we all going to be judged by the
[24:14] same thing how many believe that this
[24:15] morning
[24:16] and that's going to be the word of god
[24:18] no matter what family you're from no
[24:20] matter what church you belong to
[24:22] all these things the word of god is
[24:24] going to be the one that judges
[24:26] and when that word is come before you i
[24:28] don't know about you but i want to be
[24:30] right with god
[24:31] i want to say lord i fought a good fight
[24:33] come on
[24:34] i finished my course i kept the faith
[24:36] hallelujah
[24:37] come on i say keep the faith this
[24:39] morning yes
[24:41] sometimes you get to that point the way
[24:43] you want to throw your hands up but you
[24:45] got to keep the faith come on
[24:46] nevertheless how many believe that this
[24:48] morning but we find that i said on that
[24:50] date
[24:51] you know thinking about that i said it's
[24:53] the choice that's going it's between you
[24:54] and
[24:55] the choice you make is between you and
[24:57] god but i like how he says that
[24:59] he says for it is written as i live
[25:02] saith the lord
[25:03] every knee shall bow to me and every
[25:06] tongue
[25:06] shall confess to god come on every knee
[25:09] gonna bow
[25:10] and every tongue gonna confess to god
[25:13] come on
[25:15] it ain't that a man that you gotta
[25:16] answer to no man but you're gonna have
[25:18] to answer to god one day
[25:20] not answer to your husband or wife
[25:22] church you're gonna have to answer to
[25:24] god one day
[25:25] for the choice that you made come on
[25:28] when you answer to god i said lord when
[25:31] i answer to you
[25:32] i want to say lord i did my best i did
[25:35] all that you asked me to do to the best
[25:37] of my ability
[25:38] lord i might have uh stumbled sometime
[25:41] along the way
[25:42] but i did the best i could come on
[25:44] sometimes and what are we doing
[25:46] sometimes we doing the best we can come
[25:48] on
[25:48] with what we got and that's all god asks
[25:50] you to do he knows that
[25:52] what you capable of come on and that's
[25:55] why he
[25:56] he expects certain things out of you
[25:58] come on
[25:59] some people that you say god will god
[26:01] let them come on because god know what
[26:03] they're capable of
[26:04] and god know what you're capable of too
[26:06] much is given
[26:09] come on god gonna require more cheney
[26:12] and that's what it is give god like
[26:14] sister irene used to sing give god all
[26:16] you got
[26:17] come on everything that god has given
[26:20] you give it back to god
[26:21] i believe the bible says if we live we
[26:23] live unto the lord come on
[26:25] and if we die we die unto the lord
[26:28] either way we belong to god come on
[26:30] so whatever you got give it to god come
[26:33] on
[26:33] give god all you god hallelujah oh jesus
[26:37] i said lord i want to give you all i got
[26:40] lord bless you
[26:41] come on tremendously don't he come on
[26:44] give it to god come on
[26:45] god bless you with children give them to
[26:47] god come on god bless you abundantly
[26:50] give it to god and let god
[26:53] show you off to the world come on not
[26:56] that you stand and say what you've got
[26:58] or what you've achieved but you can say
[27:00] i am that i
[27:01] am come on by what the grace of god
[27:06] i'm only here before you by the grace of
[27:09] god somebody said you always talking
[27:10] about grace
[27:11] because i can't get away from it i i
[27:14] know come on
[27:16] i know that i'm only where i'm at
[27:18] because of what god is doing
[27:20] i know i'm only here before you because
[27:22] of god's mercy and grace of my life
[27:24] so how can i get away from the grace of
[27:26] god how can i get away from the love of
[27:28] god
[27:29] and all he's done for me how can i get
[27:31] away from it
[27:33] oh jesus i said on that day come on
[27:37] what it is he says that we all gonna
[27:39] have to he said so everyone
[27:41] of us shall give an account of himself
[27:44] to god come on
[27:46] you're gonna have to give an account of
[27:48] yourself to god
[27:49] you know it says that you know it uh
[27:52] many gonna come you know he was saying
[27:55] jesus talked about i think it was in
[27:56] matthew uh
[27:57] 20 24 i believe well matthew 12
[28:00] or 24 or one of them but he says that
[28:03] many on that day he said it in a couple
[28:05] places
[28:05] he said they was going to come and they
[28:07] was going to say lord lord
[28:08] come on didn't we do many things
[28:11] wonderful works in your name
[28:13] and he said that he was going to declare
[28:15] under the part for me you that work
[28:16] iniquity
[28:17] come on i ain't never knew you come on
[28:20] on that day
[28:21] i says on that day when we come to that
[28:24] place you know it said
[28:26] it said that on that day that your
[28:28] thoughts will speak louder than your
[28:29] words come on
[28:31] the thing you thought in your heart
[28:33] don't you know god is still
[28:34] revealing the secrets of the heart and
[28:37] that's what god judges us by
[28:39] i think about sarah and how you know
[28:42] when the
[28:42] when the angels and all came and how
[28:44] they began to speak to
[28:46] the lord began to speak to abraham about
[28:48] him
[28:49] was going to still give him a child and
[28:51] all and the bible said sarah laughed in
[28:54] her heart didn't it
[28:55] and said that she said shall i have
[28:57] pleasure with my lord
[28:59] in my old age and all of a sudden you
[29:01] know he began to speak he said why did
[29:03] sarah laugh
[29:04] come on she said lord i ain't loud he
[29:06] said yes but you did laugh
[29:08] come on he mighta didn't come out of her
[29:11] mouth
[29:11] but her heart what was in her heart
[29:14] spoke louder
[29:15] than what came out her mouth come on and
[29:18] that's what god
[29:19] judged her by and that's what we find
[29:22] i'm so glad
[29:23] that god judges the heart come on
[29:26] because a lot of times
[29:28] if we were judged by the outward
[29:30] appearance
[29:31] many people on the outward might not
[29:33] look like come on
[29:35] that they're right might not look like
[29:37] that they worthy come on they even
[29:39] be called a son or daughter of god but
[29:42] like he says don't judge one another who
[29:44] are you the judge come on
[29:45] god is looking deep down in that
[29:47] person's heart
[29:48] that's why somebody he says don't put
[29:51] don't cast a stumbling block don't count
[29:53] a brother
[29:54] not anymore he said don't do those
[29:56] things he said because god is going to
[29:58] judge him come on
[29:59] in the end they don't have to answer god
[30:01] you might account that person not
[30:03] but in that person's heart they was
[30:06] crying out for help
[30:08] they was crying out for mercy they were
[30:10] saying lord
[30:11] if i can only make it to the house of
[30:13] god hallelujah
[30:15] and that's what god was judged i thank
[30:17] god for that
[30:19] hallelujah that if we look many times on
[30:22] the outward appearance
[30:23] but god looking in the heart come on
[30:25] looking at the outward appearance
[30:27] with saul and david come on saul david
[30:30] looked like he did way worse than saul
[30:32] did come on
[30:33] but god looking at david he said he's a
[30:35] man after my own heart come on
[30:38] because he knew that in david's heart
[30:40] come on david would repent come on
[30:43] given the chance david would make things
[30:45] right and that's what it is sometime i
[30:48] said in your hearts
[30:49] come on he says many times they confess
[30:51] me with with their mouth but their heart
[30:53] is far from me come on
[30:54] it don't matter what you say out your
[30:56] mouth sometimes where is your heart
[30:58] in my heart lord i want to serve you in
[31:01] my heart lord i want to be right
[31:03] lord in my heart i want to praise you
[31:05] lord in my heart i want to give you
[31:06] thanks lord
[31:07] hallelujah god judges those things
[31:12] i'm so glad come on that he searches the
[31:14] heart and he tried the reigns
[31:17] when i was deep in sin hallelujah god
[31:20] saw my heart
[31:21] god knew that if i can get loose from
[31:24] the chains that was holding me
[31:26] if i can break free from the depression
[31:28] that had me bound
[31:30] hallelujah i would give them praise so
[31:33] he extended grace to me hallelujah
[31:36] oh jesus he made a way out of no way
[31:39] he opened doors hallelujah
[31:43] somebody looked at you and they say how
[31:45] can you make it
[31:46] hallelujah how'd you get where you are
[31:48] only by the grace of god
[31:50] he saw what was in my heart hallelujah
[31:53] he knew that if he took the shackles
[31:55] off my hands i'd praise him hallelujah
[31:58] he knew if he gave me a voice i say
[32:01] thank you jesus
[32:02] i testify tell somebody of the goodness
[32:05] of jesus
[32:10] hallelujah i say give god all you got
[32:13] come on
[32:14] if you got a voice praise god come on if
[32:17] god took the shackles off your hands
[32:19] worship god hallelujah oh jesus
[32:22] come on ain't god good
[32:25] come on ain't god so good come on
[32:29] you you listen to those things sometime
[32:31] and say god is so good come on
[32:34] he's been so good to me hallelujah
[32:37] he's been gooder gooder than good
[32:39] hallelujah better than good god is so
[32:42] good to us over and over again isn't it
[32:46] but i said on that day come on on that
[32:49] day
[32:50] you know you'll be it said like it says
[32:52] your thoughts
[32:53] speak louder than your words come on you
[32:56] know
[32:57] and that's what that's what happens we
[32:58] look at sometimes
[33:00] situations and all and i like how you
[33:03] talking about judgment come on we know
[33:05] that judgment begins in the house of god
[33:07] come on
[33:08] but what it is it's the word judging
[33:10] hallelujah
[33:11] it's the word showing us where we're
[33:13] right where we're wrong come on
[33:15] and it isn't that you in line with rules
[33:19] and regulations
[33:20] but you line up with the word of god
[33:22] come on you find
[33:25] certain things in the word sometimes
[33:27] that might be hard
[33:28] that might be cutting but you say lord
[33:30] whatever it is come on
[33:32] let the potter mold your life come on
[33:35] let the potter
[33:36] shape you make you come on until what he
[33:39] desires of you
[33:40] we got many ambitions and goals of what
[33:42] we want to be come on
[33:44] but let god let god shape you let god
[33:47] make you come on
[33:48] lord what will thou have me to do i want
[33:50] to be whatever you want me to be
[33:53] i want to do god whatever you want me to
[33:54] do come on and that's what it is
[33:57] it reminds me we're saying you know that
[33:59] how god look at the heart
[34:01] you know i'll tell you how how powerful
[34:03] the lord is
[34:05] you know i always tell a testimony how
[34:07] we went down
[34:08] me and brother carl once went down the
[34:10] black bottom they call it down in
[34:12] orangeburg and
[34:13] how we were out witnessing and we went
[34:15] up to a drug house and
[34:16] you know and brother carl got out the
[34:19] car and went in the back and
[34:21] and then he was out there talking to the
[34:23] people about the lord
[34:24] come on and all of a sudden it was when
[34:27] we got back to the car it was a man
[34:29] at the drug house in a full suit
[34:32] come on it was on a sunday afternoon he
[34:34] had a full suit on
[34:36] and he says that i got dressed to go to
[34:39] church this morning
[34:41] but i ain't never make it come on and it
[34:43] did something
[34:45] to our hearts in such a way that we went
[34:48] on park the car and got out in the
[34:49] middle of the street
[34:51] and began praying for this man and i
[34:53] believe that
[34:55] even though he found himself and at the
[34:58] drug house on a sunday morning i believe
[35:00] god
[35:00] knew what was in that man's heart i
[35:03] believe that man's
[35:04] heart cry hallelujah broke past
[35:07] where he was at broke past the condition
[35:10] the way he was at
[35:11] and though he couldn't make it god
[35:14] was willing hallelujah to send somebody
[35:17] by his way
[35:18] to talk to him about the goodness of
[35:20] jesus
[35:22] to bring church to where he was
[35:24] hallelujah
[35:25] not only church but prayer hallelujah
[35:28] and that don't you don't you think the
[35:30] lord come on he's just like that come on
[35:33] he knows what's in the heart god that's
[35:35] why you want to be available for god to
[35:37] use you come on
[35:38] and even if you can't make it to the
[35:40] house of god sometimes you still got a
[35:42] crowd lord i desire to be in your house
[35:46] lord i desire for your help lord i
[35:49] desire for your mercy
[35:50] i believe god are here from heaven
[35:52] hallelujah and he'll send somebody
[35:55] by your way hallelujah oh jesus
[35:58] don't that excite you come on to know
[36:01] that
[36:02] every time you you pray god is listening
[36:05] come on
[36:06] and that's why the devil don't want you
[36:07] to pray because he knows that when you
[36:10] start praying come on
[36:12] he'll tell you oh you ain't in the
[36:14] condition to pray come on
[36:16] try to discourage you but you know one
[36:19] thing about it god knows that come on
[36:22] but what's in your heart come on all you
[36:24] got to do is cry
[36:25] cry out hallelujah i believe samson
[36:28] even in his condition he had it in his
[36:30] heart that there was a possibility
[36:33] that if i cry out maybe the lord hear me
[36:35] come on
[36:36] i know i'm wrong i know where i'm at but
[36:38] if i cry out loud enough
[36:41] jonah in the wells fish belly hallelujah
[36:45] deep down in he said from the belly of
[36:48] hell i cried
[36:49] god heard him from the belly of hell
[36:51] didn't he from the depths of hell god
[36:53] heard him
[36:54] i say this morning crowd hallelujah
[36:58] ask god what you have need make your
[37:00] petition known
[37:01] and let's see what god will do
[37:02] hallelujah oh
[37:04] jesus somebody give god praise this
[37:06] morning
[37:08] i said on that day come on on that day
[37:12] you know paul here speaking about it
[37:15] and as many other scriptures i want to
[37:17] go to this morning but i just for the
[37:19] sake of time
[37:20] i said on that day you know we find that
[37:23] i said everything we do in this life
[37:27] come on it's leading up to something
[37:29] come on
[37:31] it's leading up leading up to what
[37:34] to the end to that day come on to that
[37:37] day when you have to stand before god
[37:40] and then when we get to that point i
[37:43] says you know
[37:44] there ain't nothing uh certain in this
[37:46] life come on
[37:48] it's not you ain't even certain that
[37:50] you'll leave here and go home today
[37:52] come on ain't even certain that you'll
[37:54] go home and cook you'll even be here
[37:56] tomorrow that's not certain come on
[37:58] but there's one thing that's certain one
[38:01] thing that's for sure
[38:03] one day you're gonna have to meet god
[38:05] and you're gonna have to give an account
[38:07] for the life that you live the bible
[38:10] talked about it
[38:11] whether it be good or whether it be evil
[38:14] the things you've done in this body
[38:15] you'll have to give an account form
[38:17] that's one thing that we do know come on
[38:20] that will have to meet god one day
[38:22] but when that day comes come on i said
[38:26] you can live a you can live a good life
[38:29] come on
[38:29] and it ain't so much about the beginning
[38:33] that's not what we're dealing with
[38:35] because we know that we were born in sin
[38:37] come on
[38:38] in iniquity that our mother conceived we
[38:40] were born wrong come on
[38:41] we were born lost born in this world
[38:45] without god and without uh a savior come
[38:48] on
[38:49] but nevertheless that's why he came and
[38:52] he died hallelujah
[38:54] and he shed his blood sent back the holy
[38:57] ghost
[38:58] now all that are far off as many as the
[39:01] lord our god should call
[39:03] that if they obey them and repent and be
[39:06] baptized
[39:06] in the name of jesus christ for the
[39:08] remission of your sins
[39:10] he didn't say i might do it but he said
[39:13] you shall
[39:14] receive the gift of the holy ghost well
[39:17] who is that for
[39:18] that's for you and to your children
[39:20] hallelujah
[39:21] to your children's children we'll say it
[39:23] like that the media is our lord god
[39:26] shall call
[39:27] whosoever will let him come hallelujah
[39:31] oh jesus come on he made a way
[39:34] of escape so he says that you know it's
[39:37] not so much the beginning
[39:39] hallelujah not so much what all
[39:42] was done in the middle but when you come
[39:44] down to the end come on
[39:46] when it comes down to that time the way
[39:49] you got to cross over
[39:51] come on on that day hallelujah
[39:55] only thing that'll matter come on is
[39:58] being right with god all of the we says
[40:02] that
[40:02] you know all of the the little things
[40:05] they'll come back before you one day
[40:07] come on the little unconfessed sins
[40:10] the little lies come on the little
[40:14] cheating the little
[40:15] the little things hallelujah they'll be
[40:17] big
[40:18] on that day how many believe that this
[40:20] morning
[40:21] but we find that hallelujah i said lord
[40:25] when i come to that room to that place
[40:29] lord stand by me hallelujah
[40:32] i don't want to talk about all the good
[40:35] i've done
[40:36] because it has filthy rice but god on
[40:40] that day
[40:40] i want you to stand by me lord
[40:43] hallelujah
[40:44] vouch for me hallelujah
[40:48] oh jesus you know one one song i heard
[40:51] once
[40:52] uh he took my place come on
[40:56] down at a at a gospel uh choir
[40:59] concert to my sister once and they were
[41:02] singing that song
[41:03] he took my place come on and all of a
[41:06] sudden

[41:13] hallelujah
[41:15] i'm only can overcome because he
[41:17] overcame
[41:18] he went in my place come on he died for
[41:21] me
[41:22] it's got to be personal he died for you
[41:24] this morning come on
[41:26] he took your place why are you sad
[41:29] why are you weeping hallelujah oh the
[41:32] lion the tribe of judah

[41:37] took your place hallelujah
[41:39] so when you come to the end of the road
[41:41] it ain't nothing that you've done
[41:43] or what you could have did but it's all
[41:46] in him hallelujah
[41:47] and what he done for you he took your
[41:49] place oh
[41:51] jesus took your place
[41:54] but i said all those things come on when
[41:57] we come down
[41:58] when we come down to the end come on on
[42:01] that day

[42:07] talking to my sister
[42:09] before she passed away i ain't had the
[42:12] words to say
[42:14] but i remember him telling her he says
[42:16] you know because she said she was ready
[42:18] come on he began to tell her well
[42:21] nothing else matters now come on
[42:23] but love whatever it
[42:27] come on because nothing short of perfect
[42:29] love is going to enter there
[42:30] come on so all that everything else
[42:33] nothing no matter right now come on
[42:35] on that day hallelujah you want to have
[42:38] love in your heart
[42:39] on that day you don't want no trouble at
[42:42] the river
[42:43] but you want all things that's why it

[43:07] seeing
[43:08] many that was that was leaving here come
[43:11] on
[43:12] and nothing else matter come on
[43:16] when it came down to that point nothing
[43:18] mattered
[43:20] what was going to happen tomorrow didn't
[43:21] matter what happened yesterday didn't
[43:24] matter
[43:25] but only they mattered was will he
[43:28] accept me
