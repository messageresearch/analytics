those safe and Lord keep us and lead us and guide us that we may hear from you in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'll turn to the Book of Matthew chapter [Applause] 18 Matthew chapter 18 and we're going to start in verse 21 very a very familiar script to some unfamiliar to some but that's okay Matthew 18 and verse Matthew chapter 15 I got the wrong scripture Matthew chapter 15 and and verse 21 when you got it say amen amen and it reads then Jesus went then and departed in the co of Ty and sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered heard not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then then came she and worshiped him and said Lord help me but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fth from the master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith and be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour and amen God bless Serena's word you may be seated tonight amen tonight I'd like to speak on a topic that I entitled getting down to business with God getting down to business with God and you see in this story something had taken place in This Woman's life that she needed something from God she had gotten to the point that she was not going to be turned away she was not going to be disturbed by what was said to her she wasn't going to be discouraged by what was told to her even if it came from Jesus she wasn't going to take no for an answer she had come to the point that she had gotten down to business with God she had gotten to the point that she didn't worry about the no cuz she wasn't going to take no for an answer she had gotten to the point that she knew that she that her daughter needed something if she didn't get something her she her life was never going to be changed but she had gotten to that point and gotten down so the business that God that the Lord couldn't even discourage her with with his words she said that Lord she found a way that said you know what even though it might seem down there's a way that I can praise him there's a way that I can get things there's a blessing in there somewhere for me and she said when it wasn't meat to give the dolls to Children's the children's bread she said Lord even the dogs get the crumbs from the master's table see she had found a way to get down so down the business said Lord whatever you can give me I'll take it see sometimes you want the pretty package but sometimes God want to give you the little piece of seed that's going to feed all your needs you want the table to be spread but God gives you the seed and say plant the seed say water the seed watch the seed grow stick it in the light and then you don't have to worry about being fed no more but sometimes you just want the table to be spread for you and that only suffices for one meal amen amen but sometimes God is trying to supply more than one meal he's trying to supply everything that you asking for but are you willing to wait for it are you willing to get down to business with God that when you get down to him you said no matter how long it takes Lord I'm in need of something and I'm staying here until I get what I need from God see that's what it takes sometimes you got to get down to business with God see sometimes when you when you're going through something or you come to a space and time in life you realize that it takes patience that it takes patience if you live long enough and go through enough things you realize it takes patience for some things many times I was thinking about getting getting for example getting a car sometimes you got to save money before you get the car otherwise your payments are going to be a whole lot more expensive than other times so some people know understand what I'm talking about so sometimes it takes time it takes you putting money aside it takes you being steady at a job it takes you to putting in time and effort to be there because you realize this is something that I really want when you really want that car Nothing Stops you from getting what you want you will save money you'll stop going out to eat you'll stop spending money on gifts you won't go to the store because you said I don't want nothing because I want that car I want that car and that's what I want and if it's if it's in you you going to set aside a lot of things sometimes you got to sacrifice a lot of things to get what you want but see you got to take the same approach with God sometimes you got to set aside this and set aside that and set aside my plans set aside my job set aside this because there's nothing more important than getting down to business with God there's nothing that stand that's more important than you getting down on your knees and say Lord I need something from you because he can do more than you working all your life to get he can just give it to you but you got to get down to business with him to say Lord this is what I need and this is what I want you to do am said the prophet of God said when you really get down the business that's when God will go to acting many of times you wonder why God hasn't moved yet but then ask yourself have you gotten down to business with God yet have you really decided that you wanted to surrender all did you really get down and say Lord I want to give you everything have you gotten to that point yet but yet you still going to God Lord why hasn't it not happened yet Lord why hasn't this taken place Lord I asked you on this day at this time that I needed this this this that and the other God didn't fail so what's the problem if God is the same yesterday today and forever then what's the problem it's not God it's you then you got to look at yourself and say Lord have I died out enough Lord have I stayed down on my knees long enough Lord have I come to you and gotten with you and said Lord I'm getting down the business with you today sometimes you always waiting for the next day to come and say I'll do it tomorrow well if it didn't happen today it might happen tomorrow but no sometimes you got to get down and said Lord I need it to happen for me today Lord right now Lord I need it to happen for me because when you really get down the business that's when God will go to acting see God God seen this woman's Faith he realized that you know what she she didn't even care whether he called her a do or not many of times we can't take nothing that people say about you but in order to get what God got for you you got to go through it in order to get what God got to go got for you you got to take people talking about you you got to take people talking behind your back and ruining your reputation but it's not about your reputation it's about what God is doing behind the scenes cuz you don't know what God is taking up for you behind the scenes but if you start following up the foolishness start following up the mess you'll be right in the same place they are and you wonder why God ain't give you what you asked him for see but it take you getting out the business with God to realize that you know what I'm not going to follow that up I'm not going to go down that PA pathway because you there's something leading you on the inside to say you know what let me pray before I react let me pray because there's something that leads you and guides you but that's after you gotten out of business with God and said Lord I want you to lead me see the Lord won't lead you if you don't want him to lead you you go around in circle like the children of Israel in the wilderness but when they got down to business with God they could go in the Jordan they can get everything that God promised him it wasn't that God was not God and he didn't promise it to him he promised it to him and they could have it all they had to do was have faith and believe and there's a story in the Bible if you think about Moses father and and the prophet of God said he said that he might have prayed for years might have prayed for years because there was a prophecy that gone forth that after so much time they would be delivered after so much time they would be delivered but he said one night when amram had prayed and maybe for several years and had his hair now turning gray and no Deliverance but just getting worse sometimes things get worse even when you getting down to business with God that's right sometimes things get worse even when you on your knees and you praying things can get worse but one now night he got right down to business and that's how we have to do it get right down the business and he said God you promised this and we're looking forward to it and we see all the signs the signs are all here and the time is at hand and it's time for you to do something about it sometimes we getting to the point now if you look at the world that you got to get down to business with God cuz you don't know how much longer we have when you look at the condition of the world you look at the storms and if you don't worry about the political thing just look at nature amen just look at all the earthquakes that are happening over in California if you don't if that don't get you then look at the political realm and if that don't get you just look at the war and if that don't get you just read your Bible that's all you have to do and you can see it listen to the prophet of God and you'll understand the time and day that you are living in and realize that you know it's too it's too long it's too short a time to be playing around with your soul it's too short a time to just go through your dayto day and think that you going to rise up tomorrow morning and everything is still going to be okay tomorrow morning that the stock market crashed what would you do but see today is the day that you can get down to business with God and say I don't trust in that I don't trust in this I don't trust in the political system I don't trust in this but to know you know who I do trust in and that's God that's Jesus who's my savior who's the head of my life that I know that he's done many wonderful works for me that I have faith in him to trust him that if I can't go to the grocery store that food will be in my refrigerator if I can't go down and drive my car the gas will be in my tank if I can't if I don't have a job tomorrow God still going to keep my lights on see that's the god that you serve but you got to get on the business with him that it's not a new relationship when it comes time when you need them it's something that is a familiar relationship that you done have conversations with him and he knows your voice when you go to get down to pray God say oh that's my child what do you need it's not a new thing you know sometimes when when a child that you don't know come up and ask you for something you hesitant you're looking around with parents you're looking around it's it's a true fact cuz you trying to figure out is it okay to give it to them and sometimes you go to God and it be a new thing it's you ain't prayed in 6 months but hey you ready to ask God for the impossible and he said he'll get he'll do the impossible because if you his child he will do things for you to prove that he's God but it shouldn't always be like that it shouldn't always be like that that the only time you go to him is when you need them it should be something that you do daily Lord just thank you for everything that you've done today Lord just thank you for waking me up this morning and when you go to sleep at night thank you for keeping you safe that day thank you for watching over me and protecting me because it's a familiar relationship it's something that he knows you and you know him you know when he speak to you and you know and you he knows when you come to him see there's something that he said the prophet of God said and faith is a victory it's the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil so faith is the victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ it said when you climb into God by prayer until you see the thing conquered under you there's nothing that can that can hurt you sometimes you got to get down to business with God so that you know that God has done something amen amen sometimes you may leave too soon the presence come and you in the anointing and you got to stay there sometimes and you got to stay there and know for sure that God has done it you got to stay there until you know for sure beyond the shadow of a doubt not you think on not not something that you feel but you know for sure that God has done it see that's getting down the business with God that's getting down that I will stay here I don't M I don't care who sees me and who don't I don't care what anybody say about me I don't care how I react but I got to get down to business with God because I need him I need them for myself until I know that these way are offer me till I know that this situation is taking care of and I can walk with a freedom with my head hung up high that Lord I know that you did it for me it wasn't nothing that I did but I knew that getting out the business with you you've done something you changed something you worked it out for me and the prophet God said now just don't turn loose take a hold just just hold on the calvary until you're satisfied you get to that cross and you hold on until you're satisfied you don't let go until you satisfied if you want your cup to run over stay there until you're satisfied sometimes you don't let go but too soon he said that's right get right right down to business and when you get to business God will get to business when you get to business God will get to business it'll be up to you it'll be up to you now just claims those those promises to you see it's up to you if you want to see God really work it's up to you bless it's not up to Mama daddy sister or brother it's up to you all it takes is you getting down to business with God for things to change amen all it takes is your prayers for things to move and stuff to start happening all it takes is you but it's when you get down to business it's up to you it's not up to anybody else it's not even up to the pastor it's up to you cuz you never know which prayer God is waiting to hear to move amen you never know which who says the prayer that God is going to answer and God move and change for everyone around you God will come and move in your situation move on your job move in the atmosphere because you set a prayer God to keep everyone safe at school because you set a prayer God will watch over everything that you do because you said a prayer said it's not just good enough to have one person pray he said pray without ceasing that applies to each and every last one of us that's not excluded that I'm excluded because Mama Prayed I'm excluded because daddy prayed I'm excluded because my sister prayed no that's something that you got to do you got to get down the business because I tell you one thing I can't get you into heaven I can't my prayers can't get you into heaven you got to do something sometimes for yourself you got to look and get serious with God for yourself cuz I can't save you but he can but you got to go to him and say Lord save me Lord I'm a wretched sinner Lord Save Me Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost cuz that's what you going to need to get there but you got to go to him and ask them I can't ask him for you I can't open up your mouth and put words in there and make them come back out but sometimes that's what you be looking for you want someone to do it for you I come up in the prayer line and expect the preacher it's all going to happen cuz he prayed but if you ain't surrendered nothing going to happen if you ain't come down and broke in and said Lord do something for me ain't nothing going to happen they can pray all night and day but it's whether what you want it's whether are you ready to get down to business with God are you ready to completely surrender to him so God can work a work in your life see that's what it's about getting down the business with God that's something that you got to understand and realize that it's not them but it's you opening your mouth and say Lord I need your help it's a personal relationship that each and every one of us have to have with God cuz that's what it takes to get down the business with God God sometimes he just want to hear you say Lord I Need You Jesus and that's all it take for him to show up on this scene he just want to say Lord I need help that's all it take for you to him to get down on the scene sometimes it take you just to break down and cry and say Lord I can't do it no more that's all it take for him to come down on the scene said that's my child that's the one that I've been waiting on to finally let me in so I can take care of all of it but that's what getting out the business entails and sometimes if you're not ready for it and and you wonder why things ain't happening it's not cuz God ain't real it's because you ain't ready to let him take complete control because that's what getting out the business entails letting God take complete control he said oh God I believe you I'll never turn loose I'll stay right here till something happens to my soul sometimes you got to stay there until something happens down down on the inside that not just on your flesh that's not just in your heart but it's deep down in the soul that you know that God has done something you know that he's worked some things out that you ain't told nobody there sometimes you have situations and things in life that you can't tell nobody but God and and it only take God to deliver you from it or to take you through it and you got to get down so serious to business with God because if you don't you know that you'll deal with it for the rest of your life but if when you experience what God can do that's why you can hear some testimony of what God has brought someone through because it's only because they got down to business with God and realize that Lord I need you to do it for me I done tried this I done tried that I done tried this but today is the day that Lord I get serious with you today is the day that I surrender all I come before you and I said Lord I need help I Surrender everything and I'm not going another step another day without you doing something for me without you saving me without you filling me with the Holy Ghost see when you get down to business with God God to do some things God to start doing things that you didn't even think of God to start doing it problems that you didn't think you had God will show you and he'll take care of them for you things that you didn't think you was struggling with God will show you and he'll take care of them for you but you got to get down to business with God and say Lord I want you to take care of these things Lord I want you to do this for me Lord I want you to remove these things from me Lord I want you to heal me in this Lord I want you to deliver me from that that's what it takes to get down to business with God CU God is still real and he promised that he would be with us he promised that he would deliver you from everything that you may go through he promised that if you needed healing he would heal you cuz he already did it when he died on Calvary he shed his blood for you so all you got to do is believe and get down to business with God sometimes in the secret closet and God will do some things that you ask him for sometimes it take leaving some things by the wayside sometimes it take sacrificing things over here and leaving this alone and leaving that alone and giving up this and giving up time doing this and giving up time doing this and put your time where it truly counts on your knees talking to God and asking him to do the things that he said he would do am sometimes you got to reorganize your schedule you got to reorganize your schedule and if you don't have a schedule you got to create one to make sure that you got time with God to make sure that you done set time aside that Lord I got the talk to you because I got to get serious with you Lord I got to see you move Lord I got to see you do some things Lord Lord I want to see your anointing in my life Lord I want to see your leadership in my life I want to walk through the door and them know that it's not me but it's you God that you're the one and true and Only God lord I want to get down to business with you that your anointing and presence is with me every day I go every morning when I wake up every night when I go to sleep Lord that I'm not afraid to go to sleep cuz I know that if if I do I'm going to be right with you I'm going to be right with you I can shout Glory Hallelujah now everything is out of my way cuz Lord I got down to business with you I can be happy Lord I can Rejoice Lord I can shout hallelujah I can live my hands and say thank you Jesus because I know he did something for me I got down to business with him and I knew that he done change my life I know that if I don't wake up I'm going to see the king I'm going to see my Lord and Savior see I got down to business with him see that's what you want to walk in Victory every day in your life you want to walk so with Jesus that you can lift your head up high and say and you're not afraid to tell nobody about Jesus you're not afraid to lift up your hands when you think of the goodness of Jesus you're not afraid to say Thank You Lord and you don't care who hears you because you done got down to business with God and know that he's real you done got down and realize that he's still God God he still does the miraculous he still does Miracles he still does signs and wonders cuz you done got down the business with God you done got down and said Lord I need you and he done showed up for you you done got down and realized Lord I Thank you cuz he done been good to me Lord I realize that you do that good cuz I'm down to business with you now see I can expect the anointing to be with me cuz I done got down to business with God and I know what that anointing and that presence feels like I know when I'm in his presence and I don't want it ever to leave so I got to stay down stay down to business with God surrendering all each and every day Paul said I Die daily you know why because he wanted the presence with them he wanted it with him every day so he had to get down to business with God each and every day every day was a new day with new tests new trials new situations and he wanted God to be with so he got down the business each and every day hallu but it's not until you decide in your heart that you want him to be there until he shows up on the scenes for you because that's what it takes to get down the business with God [Music] Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah GL come on let's stand to our feet and worship God Amen somebody worship God Amen Hallelujah I don't think that we got to say nothing else God done say what he want to say Amen but by faith you got to hear it amen you
