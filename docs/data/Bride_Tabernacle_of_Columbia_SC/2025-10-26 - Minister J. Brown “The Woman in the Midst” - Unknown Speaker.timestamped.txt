[45:18] brought unto him a woman taken in
[45:20] adultery. And when they had set her in
[45:23] the midst, they said unto him, "Master,
[45:26] this woman was taken in adultery in the
[45:30] very act."
[45:32] Now Moses in the law commanded us that
[45:35] such should be stoned. But what sayest
[45:38] thou? This they said, tempting him that
[45:42] they might have to accuse him. But Jesus
[45:45] stooped down and with his finger wrote
[45:48] on the ground as though he heard them
[45:50] not. So when they continued asking him,
[45:54] he lifted up himself and said unto them,
[45:56] "He that is without sin among you, let
[45:58] him cast a stone at thee, at her." And
[46:02] again he stooped down and wrote on the
[46:05] ground. And they which heard it, being
[46:08] convicted by their own conscience, went
[46:11] out one by one, beginning at the eldest,
[46:14] even unto the last. And Jesus was left
[46:17] alone. And the woman standing in the
[46:20] midst. When Jesus had lifted himself,
[46:24] and saw none but the woman, he said unto
[46:26] her,"Woman,
[46:28] where art those thine accusers?
[46:33] Hath no man condemned thee?" She said,
[46:36] "No, man, Lord." And Jesus said unto
[46:39] her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and
[46:43] sin no more." Let us bow our heads and
[46:49] our hearts unto him. Heavenly Father, I
[46:53] so often think of this and say it that I
[46:56] think of the oldtimers many years ago.
[46:58] They would said, they would say, "We bow
[47:02] our heads in the lumps of our shoulders.
[47:05] We look unto the dust from whence we
[47:06] came.
[47:08] And that act of bowing our head is a
[47:10] sign of humility, of reverence, and
[47:12] respect. And it truly is, Lord, a an
[47:16] indication of where we're going back to,
[47:19] Lord, if time ticks on. And we're here
[47:22] in this part of the country, Lord, for
[47:24] attending a a funeral service yesterday.
[47:27] And and so, Father, it it is just a
[47:30] reminder, Lord, unless you come until
[47:33] you come, Lord, we will all have that
[47:35] appointment with death. We'll all be
[47:38] rolled into a church house somewhere in
[47:40] a box and they'll say a few words over
[47:42] us and they'll carry that body out to a
[47:44] cemetery somewhere. But oh God, we have
[47:47] hope more than that.
[47:49] That Lord, even if we go by way of the
[47:51] grave, there is a promise that we shall
[47:54] rise. And the very word that we are
[47:57] hearing today that we've been hearing
[47:59] many of us for years, that very word is
[48:03] causing us now to create another life,
[48:06] to call another life. And that very life
[48:09] that we're feeding now that that we get
[48:12] inspiration from is the very word if we
[48:15] go by way of the grave. We've been told,
[48:17] Lord, by your word that that body will
[48:20] call the body from the grave. And so,
[48:22] Lord, there's something about this word
[48:24] that we want to hold on to this day. We
[48:27] come unto you, Father, asking you would
[48:29] forgive us of anything that would have
[48:31] been done that would cause you to turn
[48:34] your head or maybe look away or distance
[48:37] yourself from us. So, Father, we want
[48:40] your presence to come back near to us
[48:42] today. And may you fill this room with
[48:45] your presence. We honor you. We love
[48:47] you. We adore you. And we thank you for
[48:49] this opportunity. And it's in Jesus
[48:51] Christ's name we pray. Amen. May have
[48:55] your seats.
[48:57] We count it an honor to be here. And to
[49:00] Brother Simmons with the invitation and
[49:03] brother Gordon, my agent and manager,
[49:07] making sure the meetings are put
[49:09] together well and get here on time and
[49:11] and all that. So just uh truly truly
[49:14] love you and and uh we just want to
[49:16] share just a little thought that the
[49:18] Lord has laid upon me. And and I
[49:19] preached this before, but when Brother
[49:21] Gordon had called me and told me that
[49:23] that Brother Simmons wanted me to come
[49:25] and speak while I was here, this is just
[49:27] what uh came into my heart. And and I'm
[49:30] this type of person that I believe that
[49:32] whatever the Lord has, it's it's for a
[49:35] specific reason. It's for a specific
[49:37] purpose. It's for specific individuals.
[49:40] and and and so I try to wherever the
[49:43] Lord leads and and wherever he directs,
[49:45] that's what I try to do. I'm I'm just a
[49:47] a a simple person bringing a simple
[49:50] message
[49:51] &gt;&gt; and that's all that I can do. So, if if
[49:54] you're here today and you're wondering
[49:56] uh uh what can I do or what do I need to
[49:59] do, I pray that this message will speak
[50:01] to you. But just as we open up in in our
[50:04] in our reading uh it's a very familiar
[50:07] scripture and and I sort of joke when I
[50:10] say that within myself or laugh within
[50:12] myself rather that all the scriptures
[50:14] should be familiar to us
[50:16] &gt;&gt; and we hear preachers say that a lot a
[50:17] very familiar scripture but I just want
[50:19] if if I can just have your thoughts and
[50:21] in your heart just for a moment and your
[50:23] attention to the the thought the woman
[50:26] in the midst very very striking very uh
[50:30] uh pivotal
[50:32] uh uh moment in the scriptures and I
[50:34] believe it's something that we can take
[50:36] away and identify with uh uh with with
[50:40] this event with this story. But the
[50:42] woman in the midst Psalms 106
[50:46] 1 just a little bit of a foundation and
[50:49] I'll go ahead and say it now. I'm
[50:51] closing. Okay, in closing go and get
[50:54] that out the way. It's 11:15 for those
[50:57] of you that want to know.
[51:01] Psalm 106:1. Praise ye the Lord. Oh,
[51:03] give thanks unto the Lord, for he is
[51:04] good, for his mercy endureth forever.
[51:08] Who can utter the mighty acts of the
[51:10] Lord? Who can show forth all his praise?
[51:14] Blessed are they that keep judgment, and
[51:16] he that doeth righteousness at all
[51:18] times. Verse four, very striking.
[51:21] Remember me, O Lord, with the favor that
[51:24] thou beest unto thy people
[51:29] to visit me with thy salvation,
[51:33] &gt;&gt; to visit me with the the the the David
[51:36] is making this this cry unto the Lord.
[51:39] Remember me, oh God. Remember me, oh
[51:41] Lord, with the favor that thou beest
[51:43] unto thy people. Oh, visit me with thy
[51:47] salvation. So salvation is becoming a
[51:51] visitor. Salvation is coming as a guest.
[51:55] Salvation is knocking at every one of
[51:57] our doors.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Every one of us. And salvation that word
[52:01] simply means deliverance, victory,
[52:05] &gt;&gt; welfare, prosperity.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Now that's the prosperity gospel. I
[52:10] believe in
[52:12] &gt;&gt; that God coming as a vi bringing his
[52:15] presence as a visitor. And when he
[52:17] comes, he's bringing prosperity. He He's
[52:20] bringing victory. He's bringing
[52:22] deliverance. He's bringing salvation.
[52:25] [Music]
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And so many times, I think we put
[52:28] salvation in a box and we think
[52:30] salvation of the soul. Well, I gave my
[52:32] life to the Lord years ago. I was saved.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; But circumstances and time brings about
[52:38] things in our life that we need to be
[52:40] saved from.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; We get trapped in our mind and we get
[52:45] trapped in circumstances. We get trapped
[52:47] in situations that we need to be saved
[52:49] from. We need to be reminded there is a
[52:52] way out of that that you're in.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 5106 goes on to say that I may see
[53:00] the good of thy chosen. So that
[53:02] salvation has come as a guest and when
[53:05] salvation comes it will give me the
[53:07] ability to see the good of thy chosen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. and not only see what God is doing
[53:13] for other people, but that I may rejoice
[53:17] in the gladness of thy nation, that I
[53:20] may glory with thine inheritance.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; So you come today thinking that you
[53:26] can't. The word of God is telling you
[53:28] that you sure can.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; That I may see. That word see, look at
[53:32] it. It means to look at, to inspect, to
[53:36] perceive, to consider, to learn about,
[53:38] to observe.
[53:40] that I may see, that I may look at the
[53:42] good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice.
[53:45] That word rejoice means to be glad.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; So you don't have to come to church sad
[53:51] and all downtrodden as brother Joel for
[53:54] say the wsy wsy woos.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; You don't have to come trapped in that
[53:58] condition. Salvation has come today as a
[54:01] guest.
[54:03] [Applause]
[54:04] &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Rejoice in the gladness of thy nation
[54:08] that I may glory with thine inheritance.
[54:11] That word nation means people. That word
[54:14] inheritance means property, portion,
[54:17] possession.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; So in other words, Psalm 106 and5 says,
[54:23] when I see it, then what I behold or
[54:26] what I'm able to look at will cause me
[54:28] to rejoice.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then consequently my rejoicing
[54:33] will bring about such a change in who
[54:36] that I am that I too can glory that I
[54:39] too can shine.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; So as I was saying, if you think you're
[54:45] nothing, yes, you show is
[54:48] &gt;&gt; huh? I don't care what you've done. I
[54:50] don't care where you are. This this
[54:52] gospel, this word has come to set you
[54:55] free.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Joel, I was set free
[54:59] a long time ago. I gave my life to the
[55:01] Lord. Well, what's been happening in
[55:02] your life?
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Why are you not shining?
[55:07] &gt;&gt; We should be some of the happiest people
[55:09] upon the face of the earth.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; I can't help what you chose to do. I
[55:15] can't help what choices that you made.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; That you think you have to stay there.
[55:19] The gospel has come to set you free.
[55:23] All the trappings of time,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; every bad decision,
[55:28] &gt;&gt; every wrong turn,
[55:31] &gt;&gt; everything will fall under the influence
[55:33] of this word.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Because one of these days that great
[55:37] magnet is going to sweep over the earth
[55:40] &gt;&gt; and everything that has some magnetism
[55:43] ability within it that's its
[55:45] constitution is magnetized, it's going
[55:47] to be pulled up one day.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; So what is the devil? Just to borrow a
[55:51] type, what is the devil trying to do?
[55:53] He's trying to take out the magnetism in
[55:55] your life.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Psalm 106 and6 goes on to say, "We have
[56:02] sinned with our fathers. We have
[56:03] committed iniquity. We have done
[56:05] wickedly." Verse 7, "Our fathers
[56:07] understood not thy wonders in Egypt." I
[56:09] got to hurry. They remembered not the
[56:11] multitude of thy mercies, but provoked
[56:13] him at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
[56:16] Watch verse eight. Nevertheless,
[56:20] In all of this, they provoked him at the
[56:22] Red Sea. Everything that the children of
[56:24] Israel did, everything that I've done,
[56:26] everything that you've done,
[56:29] &gt;&gt; nevertheless,
[56:30] [Applause]
[56:32] &gt;&gt; he saved them for his name's sake.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; That he might make his mighty power to
[56:39] be known,
[56:41] &gt;&gt; for the sake of, on account of, because
[56:44] of his reputation,
[56:47] &gt;&gt; because of his identification,
[56:49] &gt;&gt; because of his fame, because of the
[56:51] glory of God. Why? Because the name of
[56:55] God was upon his people. The name of God
[56:58] is upon you.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; They have his identification.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Who they are is inextricably tied up in
[57:10] God.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; You cannot get away from God.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care how far you go. I don't
[57:16] know. I don't care who your friends are
[57:17] now. Yes.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Those friends pulling you away from the
[57:22] presence of God. Those friends pulling
[57:24] your mind and your conscience and your
[57:26] ability to think straight.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care about that. I know what the
[57:30] power of God can do.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Because I found out the life that I'm
[57:35] now living is the life that I was
[57:37] looking for
[57:38] &gt;&gt; when I was out in a world of sin.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let this suit fool you.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[57:49] woman in the midst. We'll get there in a
[57:51] minute.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Return in Jubilee. Watch what the
[57:55] prophet says it this way. Excuse me for
[57:56] a moment.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Every seven years they had a great
[57:59] Sabbath. Every seven days they had a
[58:02] Sabbath. Every seven years they had a
[58:03] Sabbath. And seven Sabbaths was 49
[58:05] years. Talking about going free.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the Jubilee year, every man
[58:10] that had lost his inheritance by some
[58:13] means
[58:15] &gt;&gt; lost the word of God that was once in
[58:18] their life.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; The power of God that would put them
[58:22] fall them under conviction. The power of
[58:24] God,
[58:25] &gt;&gt; not just in church, even at home, in the
[58:27] school,
[58:28] &gt;&gt; there was conviction in your life,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; but you've lost it. The prophet says by
[58:35] some means
[58:36] &gt;&gt; if he was a freeborn and a true blood
[58:39] Israelite, no matter who had the
[58:42] possession, it had to go back to him
[58:44] free.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; No matter who had the possession, who
[58:47] has the possession? The devil.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; It had to go back to him free. He didn't
[58:55] have to pay a thing. He didn't have to
[58:57] do a thing. But just stop what he was
[59:00] doing and go back to his inheritance.
[59:03] Amen.
[59:04] [Applause]
[59:06] &gt;&gt; It's that simple, saints,
[59:08] &gt;&gt; brother. It's that simple, sis. It's
[59:10] that simple. Just stop what you're doing
[59:13] &gt;&gt; and go back to the promised word of God.
[59:15] That is your inheritance.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother, you don't know what
[59:20] situation I'm in." As I said, I don't
[59:22] care about your situation.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; I'm after your soul.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; I don't have anything to bring you to.
[59:29] Y'all know me for years. Y'all know what
[59:31] I got. ain't got much.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; But I guarantee you this. If you want
[59:36] it, if you need it, it's yours.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He had a right to it. It was a
[59:43] God-given right.
[59:45] Woman in the midst.
[59:48] Now, the thing is, if what this woman
[59:52] had done was so bad,
[59:55] why didn't they take her to the
[59:56] courthouse?
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Why they have to bring her in church? M
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; I know correction begins in the house of
[1:00:03] the Lord. I'm not talking about all
[1:00:04] that. These guys were after something
[1:00:06] more.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; They weren't about church.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; They weren't about sanctimonious things.
[1:00:12] They weren't about the right things so
[1:00:13] much. They were after that word Jesus
[1:00:16] the man.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; They were after him.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; They didn't care about her and probably
[1:00:22] didn't even really care about what she
[1:00:24] had done.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; In fact, they probably had done some of
[1:00:28] those things with this very woman.
[1:00:30] Hello.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Ah, see
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; this is this is where I like to diverse
[1:00:35] just for a moment.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Y'all cute folk.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; It's the cute folk I like to talk to.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Y'all be acting all cute like, "Well,
[1:00:44] not me. I ain't do that." You've done
[1:00:47] something
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; because you're a creature of time.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; I'll let Brother Simmons deal with that.
[1:00:55] I'm just here visiting. All right. Amen.
[1:00:59] But it was an attempt to bring more
[1:01:02] shame.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; They had an audience and and there's
[1:01:06] something striking. Y'all know how it
[1:01:08] is. Cute folk, y'all know how did you
[1:01:10] get an audience? That'll embolden your
[1:01:12] purpose. You get a little more courage.
[1:01:14] I can do it. But these guys, these
[1:01:17] Pharisees and and and they had an
[1:01:19] audience.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; But there was something there there was
[1:01:22] something that the with these with the
[1:01:24] scribes and the Pharisees. Now, the
[1:01:26] scribes, they they were guys, they knew
[1:01:28] the law. They were profound expositors
[1:01:32] of the law. Praise God.
[1:01:35] They could take that word so much they
[1:01:37] could roll that scroll up and they could
[1:01:39] stick a needle or something through that
[1:01:41] roll up scroll and they could tell you
[1:01:43] every letter, every word that that
[1:01:46] needle struck. They knew the word. They
[1:01:51] had an audience. Now, the Pharisees got
[1:01:53] these two groups, the scribes and the
[1:01:54] Pharisees. The Pharisees, they they had
[1:01:57] the traditions of the fathers, but not
[1:02:00] so much of the Torah.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; So, they would go on past experiences,
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; you know, well, well, you know, my
[1:02:07] greatgrandfather was was friends with
[1:02:09] Moses
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; or something like that
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; or I was friends with the prophet,
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; they say all of these things. So, so
[1:02:16] they they wouldn't so much hold on to to
[1:02:19] the word, the Bible. We'll say it that
[1:02:21] way. But they took their traditions. And
[1:02:23] the Bible says through your traditions,
[1:02:25] you've made my word uneffective.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Little trinkets and all these little
[1:02:32] things and and proximity to and all
[1:02:34] these stories and hunting stories,
[1:02:36] fishing stories, all that's all great
[1:02:37] and good and wonderful. Donor I it's
[1:02:40] wonderful, but it ain't going to get you
[1:02:41] into heaven.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees, what these guys would
[1:02:47] do, they were very crafty with their
[1:02:50] understanding and knowledge. They would
[1:02:52] bring these little minute and these
[1:02:54] little vexacious extensions to the law
[1:03:00] and the the the scribes knew the law.
[1:03:02] The Pharisees would take it and they
[1:03:04] would add a little uh conviction here
[1:03:06] and they'll try to project that conict
[1:03:08] conviction on you and think that you are
[1:03:11] trying to tell you that the only way
[1:03:12] that you're going to get in and do right
[1:03:13] is you have to do it like I do it.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; No, we do it like this. Does it?
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; This word of God. Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; So though distinct in their expertise
[1:03:24] and what they did and who they were,
[1:03:25] their united ambition, their goal, their
[1:03:28] objective was an anointing to scrutinize
[1:03:33] Jesus.
[1:03:34] If you have just a little bit of God in
[1:03:37] you, there's going to be somebody to
[1:03:39] frustrate that purpose, that call of God
[1:03:42] that's in you. That little bit of God,
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; they wanted to entrap Jesus in some way.
[1:03:48] And there was always they were always
[1:03:51] these guys were always around whenever
[1:03:52] you see the scribes and Pharisees they
[1:03:54] were always around frustrating the
[1:03:57] purpose of Jesus.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; They were always there listen to
[1:04:01] challenged truth. They were always there
[1:04:04] to challenge present day manifested
[1:04:07] word.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said?
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Always there. So if somebody is
[1:04:14] frustrating the God in you, don't let
[1:04:17] the devil think that it's you, it's him.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Because God knows who he is.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And if you're in God, you know who you
[1:04:27] are.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us even so much so
[1:04:30] that the only weapon that the devil has
[1:04:32] is to get you to disbelieve your weapon.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Blessed Jesus. Their ambition is to tear
[1:04:43] down and destroy this manifested word.
[1:04:46] And in all of that that there were that
[1:04:48] that they were doing and their intention
[1:04:50] and their purpose, there was a casualty
[1:04:52] by the wayside.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; They did not care about this girl. As I
[1:04:56] was saying earlier, the devil don't care
[1:04:57] about you.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Get you wrapped up and tangled up in
[1:05:02] something that feels good because of the
[1:05:04] age that we're living in.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And we get tangled up in that and we
[1:05:10] think, "Oh, this is it. This is great.
[1:05:13] So, knowing the law, they were crying
[1:05:15] for judgment upon her because of her
[1:05:17] unlawful act.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; So, here we find out that the earthly,
[1:05:21] listen, the earthly was blocking the way
[1:05:24] to the heavenly.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; And that's nothing more that the devil
[1:05:28] wants to do is to block your way. And
[1:05:30] quite frankly, if there's anything, your
[1:05:33] vision of Calvary should never be
[1:05:34] obstructed.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; There should never be anything between
[1:05:37] you and your view of Calvary. The moment
[1:05:41] anything, mama, daddy, children, job,
[1:05:43] cars, anything that would stand between
[1:05:46] you and your vision of Calvary, that has
[1:05:48] now become your God.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; You might as well bow down and worship
[1:05:52] mama in her high heel shoes or whatever
[1:05:54] she wear, bunions on her toes,
[1:05:56] everything else.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; That becomes your God.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; So, whatever is there in view, whatever
[1:06:04] is obstructing your view, let's knock it
[1:06:06] down today.
[1:06:09] H
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; she was in the midst of her judgment.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; The church, it don't have to be judged.
[1:06:18] It's already been judged
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; for it judged Christ and Christ stood
[1:06:22] its judgment. We were we are in him. We
[1:06:25] are free from judgment. If God judges
[1:06:28] you, then he's unjust.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; That's tight.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz why? Christ took our judgment for
[1:06:37] us.
[1:06:38] When that man hung on the cross and even
[1:06:41] quite frankly before he made it to the
[1:06:43] cross, he was beaten to the point that
[1:06:45] he was unrecognized.
[1:06:47] The flesh was on his back. He took
[1:06:50] spittle upon his face. There he was
[1:06:52] covered in spit. There he was being
[1:06:55] beaten and flogged with and and all the
[1:06:57] stripes that he took to the point that
[1:06:59] when you looked at him, if you knew him,
[1:07:01] you would have to question, is that
[1:07:02] Jesus? Is that really him?
[1:07:06] He did that. He took our judgment. He
[1:07:09] took that curse upon himself. He became
[1:07:12] something that we don't have to. That's
[1:07:14] why I would say you don't have to muddle
[1:07:16] around in the sin. You don't have to
[1:07:18] take on the identification of who the
[1:07:19] devil says that you are.
[1:07:22] Christ took our judgment and by one
[1:07:25] spirit we're baptized into that body. He
[1:07:27] that believeth on me hath everlasting
[1:07:29] life and shall not come into the
[1:07:30] judgment. St. John 5:24. He that heareth
[1:07:34] my words and believeth on him that sent
[1:07:36] me has everlasting life.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; You believe on Jesus, you have
[1:07:41] everlasting life.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Because today, today the world would
[1:07:46] rather have religious folk would rather
[1:07:48] have their theology.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; They would rather have their science and
[1:07:52] all of their technology. They'd rather
[1:07:54] have the results from their Google
[1:07:56] search.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Yes,
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; they'd rather have their Wikipedia
[1:08:03] findings and they'll come away with all
[1:08:06] this quote knowledge
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; and it's from the tree of death.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; So that's what they would rather have.
[1:08:14] But you know what? I'll take Jesus.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Just give me Jesus. Just give me Christ
[1:08:20] and Christ alone. That's all that I'll
[1:08:23] need because that's the one that will
[1:08:24] stand when this whole world is on fire.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; He took our judge for us. He took our
[1:08:30] judgment upon himself.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman in the midst no longer
[1:08:36] have to wear the rags of sin. We've been
[1:08:39] given royal attire.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And not only have we been given that
[1:08:44] attire, we've been taught how to walk
[1:08:47] royally.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; We've been taught how we've been taught
[1:08:51] how to act in a royal manner.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; We've been given royal food to eat.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; So our diet is not what it used to be.
[1:08:59] Our diet won't hold us. Won't hold us
[1:09:01] like the world would hold us. The diet
[1:09:03] that we have now is eternal quality.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; And that diet that we're eating now is
[1:09:08] going to change our very bodies.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; So go on with your Wikipedia searches.
[1:09:14] Go on with all of your Google searches
[1:09:17] cuz the world is saying that search
[1:09:19] Google for in that I can find eternal
[1:09:21] life. No. The Bible says search the
[1:09:23] scriptures for the scriptures is what
[1:09:25] contains eternal life.
[1:09:28] Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Is that your Bible?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; He took our judgment for us and we
[1:09:34] become royal in everything that we are.
[1:09:38] Even our language changes.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; St. John 8:2 in our scene it says and
[1:09:45] early in the morning he came again into
[1:09:47] the temple and all the people came unto
[1:09:49] him and he sat down and taught them
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; in church.
[1:09:55] church.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; This should have been the one place that
[1:09:58] this girl found refuge.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Church hurt.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Talking to Brother Gordon about it on
[1:10:04] the way to church. Church hurt. Our
[1:10:07] young people are suffering from church
[1:10:09] hurt. The older people, you've been hurt
[1:10:11] in church before, but you've gotten a
[1:10:13] little strong and you've gotten a little
[1:10:14] more distance from it. But our kids are
[1:10:16] hurting
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; because of things that's happened in
[1:10:19] church. because of things that other
[1:10:21] young people have said and done. Mamas,
[1:10:24] daddies, your children being prayed for.
[1:10:26] I guarantee you. I promise you. I may
[1:10:28] not know their names specifically, but
[1:10:30] individually, but your children are be
[1:10:33] that's your inheritance.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Don't give up on them. I know they're
[1:10:36] knuckleheads.
[1:10:38] I know I have three,
[1:10:42] but your children are Don't give up on
[1:10:44] them.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; They're part of your promise.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Young lady, if if mama is you,
[1:10:50] what you think is nagging, she loves
[1:10:52] you.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Son, your mama, your daddy, they love
[1:10:56] you.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; They want what's best for you. Their
[1:10:59] heart is for you.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; So, here she was in church and the eyes
[1:11:05] weren't lovingly looking upon her. They
[1:11:07] were glaring at her in church.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; The words that she heard weren't
[1:11:12] celestial. She didn't feel uplifted in
[1:11:15] the spirit. The words coming upon her
[1:11:17] ears were critical.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; And the pronouncement of those words
[1:11:21] were killer.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Get rid of her.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Well, he don't need to come to church. I
[1:11:26] know what he did last night.
[1:11:30] That's not the spirit of God.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; This is church. This is the house of
[1:11:34] God. There's liberty here.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Because there is a voice that's greater
[1:11:41] than criticism. Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; There's an allseeing eye that's greater
[1:11:45] than the ones that have glared at you
[1:11:47] before.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; These eyes are more penetrating
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; which see deeper than the situation.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; There is a verdict greater than that of
[1:11:57] the jury. The preacher and the
[1:11:58] congregation were bringing judgment. The
[1:12:01] Pharisees and the scribes typing the the
[1:12:03] the the the church and the church body.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; And no doubt this was a very low day for
[1:12:11] this woman. Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; They were getting ready to kill girl,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; stone her, and she knew enough about the
[1:12:17] word that what they were saying was
[1:12:19] true, but their intention behind it all
[1:12:22] was twisted.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; They were using the very word to bring
[1:12:27] this judgment upon this young girl. And
[1:12:29] no doubt, she was very low that day. And
[1:12:33] she was just about to give up and
[1:12:35] surrender to her fate. But watch what
[1:12:38] happens. Verse 6 in St. John 8 then they
[1:12:42] said tempting him that they might have
[1:12:45] to accuse him but Jesus stooped down
[1:12:52] and with his finger wrote on the ground
[1:12:56] as though he heard them not.
[1:12:59] So Jesus stooped down. I can imagine
[1:13:02] there that day in in the temple and that
[1:13:05] there's a lot of debate surrounding
[1:13:07] about what he was writing and where and
[1:13:09] all this and and and what he was saying
[1:13:11] and some talk about how he was writing
[1:13:13] the sins of the guys that were bringing
[1:13:14] this accusation and all of these things.
[1:13:16] But but the the the thing that strikes
[1:13:18] me is here this man was all of this
[1:13:21] clamor, all of this noise in church, all
[1:13:25] of the churchity that they were trying
[1:13:27] to bring, all of the sanctimonious ways
[1:13:29] that they were trying to present
[1:13:31] themselves. But he did nothing more than
[1:13:33] just stoop down.
[1:13:35] And that that signifies when when in in
[1:13:38] this time period when a when a person
[1:13:40] would soup down that that at that time
[1:13:43] in that way they were saying that I give
[1:13:45] no regard to what is being said around
[1:13:48] me right now.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I don't care a word about what is being
[1:13:52] said about me because my savior is
[1:13:54] stooping. And no doubt I'm sure that God
[1:13:57] is here today in your circumstance. And
[1:14:00] I want you to know today that Jesus once
[1:14:02] again has come and in the temple in the
[1:14:05] house of God and he's stooping by your
[1:14:07] side to let you know, sis, it's going to
[1:14:09] be okay.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; You don't have to listen to all the
[1:14:12] noise. You don't have to listen to all
[1:14:14] the clamor. You don't have to take on
[1:14:16] the identification of what Satan is
[1:14:18] trying to say that you are.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; He's been doing that since the Garden of
[1:14:24] Eden. He took Eve in her mind and he
[1:14:27] tried to project his identification on
[1:14:29] her when she already had the full word.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; But what happened is she got from behind
[1:14:37] her defense.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You stay behind this word of God. Like
[1:14:41] the old song says, if mama don't go,
[1:14:44] I'll journey on.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; If the preacher don't go, I'm going to
[1:14:47] journey on. I'm going to continue on.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jesus stooped down. And I can
[1:14:54] just imagine Jesus looking from the
[1:14:57] crowd and then looking back at her as
[1:14:59] he's there writing whatever he was
[1:15:01] writing. Whatever the pronouncement was
[1:15:03] that he was doing, he was looking at
[1:15:05] her. He was looking at them. But he was
[1:15:07] giving no regard to the clatter.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil's telling
[1:15:12] you.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; You're here today in this room, in this
[1:15:16] place
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; to let you know that God sees where you
[1:15:20] are.
[1:15:21] woman, you're in the midst of something
[1:15:23] greater than you will ever imagine.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Today is the day of salvation. Harden
[1:15:28] not your hearts in that time, in that
[1:15:30] moment.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Brother Joel, I've heard
[1:15:34] that before. I say it all the time."
[1:15:36] Guess what? You're going to hear it
[1:15:37] again.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Because it's necessary cuz sometimes we
[1:15:41] forget, Brother Ernest. Yes, sir.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we forget where we came from.
[1:15:48] That's why we act cute sometimes.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; We don't have a lot of grace for the one
[1:15:53] that's going through what you went
[1:15:54] through 20 years ago, 40 years ago.
[1:15:56] Because why? You forgot.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; You're royal.
[1:16:02] You've been bought with a price.
[1:16:06] Stooped.
[1:16:07] It was intentional action. It was it was
[1:16:11] a specific action and it was done in
[1:16:14] order to signify disregard.
[1:16:17] So if anything more from this sermon
[1:16:19] today you have you can take away that
[1:16:22] the next time the devil comes telling
[1:16:24] you in your ear in your quiet time in
[1:16:26] your alone time you have to say devil
[1:16:29] there was a man that's in this room in
[1:16:31] this room today that I heard speaking to
[1:16:34] me and I've been made aware that Jesus
[1:16:37] is stooping for me
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; in my situation because of my situation
[1:16:42] I don't even have to hear what you're
[1:16:43] saying
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Because the more that I surrender, I
[1:16:49] find out that my li load gets a little
[1:16:51] lighter.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; And it gets easier to understand this
[1:16:55] road. I'm traveling down. Y'all know
[1:16:57] sister Brenda.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; No more wavering or wandering. Now I'm
[1:17:02] standing where? On solid ground.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; It's not anything shaking because it's
[1:17:09] going to take a stronger wind than
[1:17:10] anything the devil going to try to blow
[1:17:12] our way. Let him huff and puff until he
[1:17:15] gets out of breath.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Have the devil hyperventilating.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; My goodness, woman in the midst.
[1:17:27] You think your situation is bad, sis,
[1:17:31] brother. You think your situation is
[1:17:32] bad, but guess what? You you you think
[1:17:34] that that that that it's mighty low
[1:17:36] where I've been.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus went lower than that.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Imagine that. I don't care how low you
[1:17:44] are, how low you've ever been. Jesus
[1:17:46] went lower than that. Galatians 1:4
[1:17:48] says, "Who gave himself for our sins."
[1:17:50] Watch this. That he might deliver us
[1:17:54] from this present evil world.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; According to the will of God and our
[1:17:59] father, who gave himself for our sins,
[1:18:01] that he might deliver. That word deliver
[1:18:03] means to pluck out.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; To pluck out, to choose out for one's
[1:18:10] own self. Select one person from many.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; H think about that just for a moment.
[1:18:17] All the other the people that going
[1:18:18] through trials and situations, God has
[1:18:20] chosen you to deliver you, to pluck you
[1:18:23] out of many.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; That should give you reason and cause
[1:18:28] enough to be the happiest person on the
[1:18:29] face of the earth.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; We've heard it said that if there was
[1:18:33] only one person going out of going to
[1:18:35] take the rapture in Columbia, South
[1:18:37] Carolina, guess what? y'all in trouble
[1:18:39] cuz Joel Brown is in Columbia, South
[1:18:41] Carolina today. If the rapture happens
[1:18:43] today and only one's going, sorry,
[1:18:45] brother Gordon, I love you. You're my
[1:18:47] manager and all. I love you. You ain't
[1:18:49] going.
[1:18:51] We have to have that kind of faith. We
[1:18:54] have to have that kind of purpose. We
[1:18:56] have to have that kind of walk, that
[1:18:57] belief,
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:01] because after all, we've been called to
[1:19:04] a royal situation.
[1:19:06] We have to act eloquently, not cute.
[1:19:09] Don't get it twisted. Don't get it mixed
[1:19:11] up. I'm talking about being royal.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; There's a certain error about royalty.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; So deliver means to pluck out. To
[1:19:21] deliver that we that he might deliver us
[1:19:23] from this present evil world. That word
[1:19:26] evil means full of labors. Listen to
[1:19:28] this y'all. It'll fit everybody here.
[1:19:30] Full of labors, annoyances, hardships. H
[1:19:36] bless
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; pressured and harassed by labors. How
[1:19:40] many's been harassed?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; By by time, by circumstances, by
[1:19:44] situations. Amen. It's evil. A time full
[1:19:48] of peril to Christian faith and
[1:19:51] steadfastness causing pain and trouble.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That old dumb devil.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; He don't realize that the more pressure
[1:19:58] he brings on me, that God is bringing
[1:20:00] more deliverance to me.
[1:20:02] [Applause]
[1:20:04] Galatians 1:5 goes on to say to whom to
[1:20:07] whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
[1:20:10] Philippians 2:6, who being in the form
[1:20:12] of God, thought it not robbery to be
[1:20:15] equal with God.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; But made himself of no reputation.
[1:20:21] So think about this. This man that hung
[1:20:23] on the cross, that took all these
[1:20:24] stripes, that gave his very life, that
[1:20:27] went into the tomb, that rose up from
[1:20:29] that tomb victoriously,
[1:20:31] he emptied himself out,
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; So, you're wondering where did that that
[1:20:37] royal thing come from? It came from
[1:20:40] eternity.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; He everything that God was, he forsook
[1:20:46] it all to come to this old sin cursed
[1:20:49] world. He forsook it all to come to you
[1:20:51] today in this service
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; to let you know that you're in the midst
[1:20:56] of something greater.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; He stripped himself of everything that
[1:21:01] he was. Colossians 1:12 says, "Giving
[1:21:03] thanks unto the father which hath made
[1:21:05] us meat to be partakers of the
[1:21:08] inheritance of the saints in light."
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:13 goes on to say, "Who
[1:21:14] hath delivered us from the power of
[1:21:17] darkness?" Now watch that. the power of
[1:21:20] darkness. We've been delivered in in
[1:21:22] Galatians 1:4, delivered from this evil
[1:21:24] world. But Colossians, Paul speaks it.
[1:21:27] He says, "We've been delivered from the
[1:21:29] power of darkness."
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And hath translated us into the kingdom
[1:21:34] of his dear son. That word power means
[1:21:36] authority.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; The authority of darkness, the
[1:21:40] jurisdiction of darkness, the strength
[1:21:43] of darkness.
[1:21:45] Let me tell you, the devil is not
[1:21:47] anything to contend with.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; You better know who you are.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And we've been called. We've been we've
[1:21:55] been given a purpose. We've been given a
[1:21:57] position in Jesus Christ so we don't
[1:21:59] have to back down from him.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Who have delivered us from the power of
[1:22:02] darkness, the the authority of darkness.
[1:22:04] That word darkness, watch this.
[1:22:05] Metaphorically, it speaks of ignorance,
[1:22:08] respecting divine things. So th this
[1:22:11] present world that we're living in, this
[1:22:13] darkened state that the world is in, it
[1:22:15] it it it it causes us to to be ignorant
[1:22:19] to divine things. We forget what God has
[1:22:22] done for us because the trappings of
[1:22:25] time and everything that that time
[1:22:27] brings upon us. As I was saying, we we
[1:22:29] do sometimes we forget where God has
[1:22:31] brought us from. And that's because of
[1:22:33] the power of this darkness, the strength
[1:22:35] of this darkness, respecting divine
[1:22:37] things and human duties and accompanying
[1:22:39] ungodliness and immorality. So when
[1:22:42] someone loses their ability to remember
[1:22:44] the divine things, what does it bring in
[1:22:48] their lives, it brings ungodliness and
[1:22:50] immorality.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; They'll just forsake God and what God
[1:22:54] has done for them and and forsake what
[1:22:56] God has told them together with their
[1:22:59] consequent misery. So this darkness
[1:23:02] comes in such a way that it brings
[1:23:04] misery,
[1:23:06] discomfort. It becomes so much so the
[1:23:08] darkness becomes visible and holds sway.
[1:23:11] Colossians 1:14, in whom we have
[1:23:14] redemption through his blood, even the
[1:23:16] forgiveness of sins, who is the image of
[1:23:18] the invisible God, the firstborn of
[1:23:20] every creature
[1:23:22] image, who is the image of the invisible
[1:23:25] God, not a resemblance, but the exact
[1:23:28] likeness. Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; The very likeness of God.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the body that carried the name
[1:23:37] of God.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; And if all that God was, he poured into
[1:23:42] this man Jesus. And all Jesus was, he
[1:23:44] poured into you, the bride, the church,
[1:23:46] the body on the earth in 2025.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; So you are now the body that carries
[1:23:53] God.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I don't know about that, brother Joel.
[1:24:00] If you have God,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; you have God.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; How simple is that?
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; If I'm going to say that I'm a
[1:24:08] Christian, then guess what? I'm going to
[1:24:09] act like it. I'm going to talk like it.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be like it. I'm going to do
[1:24:14] like it.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Because we have to take on that
[1:24:19] identification. If we say that we are
[1:24:20] something,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; because when we were out in the world,
[1:24:23] we did exactly what the devil said that
[1:24:25] we were.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; H the devil says dance. Okay. Devil says
[1:24:30] drink. Yep. Devil says shoot drugs in my
[1:24:33] veins. Absolutely. We did those things.
[1:24:36] Huh?
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Take another man's wife. Take another
[1:24:39] wife's husband.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; But Joel. Yes. Humanity.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; H.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But we've been set at liberty.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "What? Why are you saying all
[1:24:51] these things, Brother Joel? These are
[1:24:53] things of my past." The devil's been
[1:24:55] knocking on your door lately.
[1:24:57] He's been trying to to remind you of who
[1:25:00] you were
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; just as he did to Eve. That's what he's
[1:25:03] doing to us today.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; He's there trying to change your
[1:25:07] identification.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Trying to get you further away from the
[1:25:12] defense of this word.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; And the moment that he does and there's
[1:25:16] no man around, he's able to impregnate
[1:25:19] his seed into you.
[1:25:22] And then you walking around pregnant,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; carrying a child, and it's not of God.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And you you you you birth confusion. You
[1:25:30] you birth animosity. You birth hatred.
[1:25:32] You birth anger.
[1:25:34] You birth temper.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; All of these things that's not of God,
[1:25:38] saints.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Woman in the midst.
[1:25:47] Jesus
[1:25:48] was the body that carried the name of
[1:25:51] God.
[1:25:52] And within that body
[1:25:55] of that man, Jesus Christ was
[1:25:58] tabernacled the fullness of God.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; And God chose a body in which to
[1:26:05] encapsulate his essence, his attributes,
[1:26:08] because he emptied himself out. He
[1:26:11] emptied all of heaven to come to earth.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Think about that. That wasn't some man
[1:26:17] sitting on one throne and Jesus the son
[1:26:18] sitting on the throne beside him. No, it
[1:26:20] was the same God. It was the same being.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; H that's why God don't have any
[1:26:26] grandchildren.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; God has sons and daughters,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; children.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; That little Jehovah that was bottled up
[1:26:35] on the inside of this man called Jesus.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And that chosen body would be the
[1:26:41] manifesting station from which his
[1:26:43] purpose would be expressed.
[1:26:46] Listen, I'm going to read that again.
[1:26:48] That chosen body would be the
[1:26:51] manifesting station from which his
[1:26:53] purpose would be expressed. There stood
[1:26:56] this little woman. She did not realize
[1:26:58] she was going to be a manifestation for
[1:27:00] the word to be expressed in her life.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there she stood, no doubt,
[1:27:06] trembling in her body, ready to give
[1:27:09] into fate. Her body didn't know it was
[1:27:13] being yielded for the purpose of God.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; So a body has significance. Your body is
[1:27:19] important.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; You think, well, I can do what I want to
[1:27:22] with it. That's why all these things
[1:27:24] that are going on in the land today that
[1:27:25] they they they they think that, well,
[1:27:27] I'm a male, but I I you know what? I
[1:27:29] feel like I might be a woman.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; That boy running around say, y'all, I
[1:27:33] feel like a girl.
[1:27:36] It feel like the devil.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:40] It's it's
[1:27:42] a mind sickness.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; I can't think of the word I'm trying to
[1:27:48] catch. My But a body has significance.
[1:27:53] And God can only show his glory when his
[1:27:56] people stand still and looks for it.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; God can only do something for you until
[1:28:03] you stand still
[1:28:05] and begin to look for it. Amen. This
[1:28:09] woman, she was about to be awakened.
[1:28:13] There was something getting ready to to
[1:28:14] strike this woman's life
[1:28:18] to let her know the realities of who she
[1:28:20] really was.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And the titles which life sometimes
[1:28:27] brings upon an individual, the devil
[1:28:30] will begin to whisper in individual's
[1:28:32] ears and tell them these types of
[1:28:34] things. You're nothing but a thief.
[1:28:37] You're a liar. You're a cheat. You're a
[1:28:41] doubter.
[1:28:43] You're an alcoholic.
[1:28:45] These are things that life will bring
[1:28:48] upon individuals and you will take on
[1:28:51] the cloak of self-abusement.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; That will become your identification.
[1:28:58] an addict, a lesbian, a homosexual,
[1:29:03] violent, a
[1:29:06] a whoreonger. Say, "Brother Joel, those
[1:29:09] are plain words." Yeah, they are. But
[1:29:11] we're living in a plain world.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; You can't walk down a grocery aisle
[1:29:15] anymore without something being
[1:29:16] plastered, without something being
[1:29:18] blared at you, just wide open.
[1:29:21] But we need to be made aware that this
[1:29:24] identification, these things that the
[1:29:26] devil's trying to put on us and say,
[1:29:28] "You wear that. You look good. You look
[1:29:30] good as as as as a as as a cheat. You
[1:29:33] look good in that temper. You know, you
[1:29:35] told them off. You got them told.
[1:29:38] Did you really?" And often times what
[1:29:41] God will do, he he will go way beyond
[1:29:45] our problem and he will strike something
[1:29:48] that is a part of himself. Catch this.
[1:29:51] He will strike something that's a part
[1:29:53] of himself in order to release that part
[1:29:55] of us that is in him to bring healing
[1:29:59] within us.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Do you catch that?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he sees us. God, do you not
[1:30:05] see where I am? Do you not see what I'm
[1:30:07] going through right now? And it's just
[1:30:08] like God passes you by and everything is
[1:30:11] dark. You can't get a prayer through
[1:30:12] nothing. But God is on his way. He's
[1:30:14] going to strike something that's way
[1:30:16] beyond your problem. Because you
[1:30:18] remember there's an identification in
[1:30:20] you that's eternal. He can't so much
[1:30:23] bring you to where you are. He don't
[1:30:25] want you muddling around in where you is
[1:30:27] where you are. He's going way beyond who
[1:30:29] you are in your situation. And he'll
[1:30:31] strike something within eternity within
[1:30:34] himself. And it will release unto you at
[1:30:37] that time at that moment. This is the
[1:30:39] real you.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; This is who you really are. Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; As I so often say that, you remember
[1:30:46] back in the day, some of you old folk,
[1:30:49] there was a thing called Bozo the clown
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; and you would pop him and he bounced
[1:30:55] right back up. A little toy had and
[1:30:58] something on the inside of that little
[1:31:00] toy that even though you knocked it
[1:31:02] down, it would get back up.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; So, every believer has within them
[1:31:07] something on the inside that when you
[1:31:09] get down, you don't stay down.
[1:31:14] There's something that God put on the
[1:31:16] inside of you that causes you to get
[1:31:18] back up. I may be bloody. I may be
[1:31:20] weary. I may be weak. I may be
[1:31:22] struggling, but I'm getting back up
[1:31:26] because something on the inside of me
[1:31:28] that's greater than my situation. God
[1:31:31] went beyond my situation and he struck
[1:31:34] eternity. And eternity comes barreling
[1:31:36] back down to my situation and where I
[1:31:39] am. And I find myself back in church
[1:31:43] singing songs,
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; cooking the food around the stove,
[1:31:47] mowing the grass with a little more pep
[1:31:49] in my step.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Not wanting to get the gun and blow your
[1:31:54] brains out.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; There's something on the inside of you
[1:31:59] that's calling you today. Get back up
[1:32:02] from where you are.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Woman, you're standing. Bride church,
[1:32:06] you're standing in the midst of
[1:32:07] something greater than your problem.
[1:32:10] greater than your situation.
[1:32:14] [Applause]
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; There's something about seeing God that
[1:32:20] releases the ability within ourselves to
[1:32:23] see the real us.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Huh? That's why we read the Bible.
[1:32:27] That's why we come to church. Because
[1:32:29] there's something in that word that
[1:32:31] keeps pulling us back to let us know
[1:32:34] this is who I really am.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; That's what he did for you. He stripped
[1:32:39] you of your identification. God has come
[1:32:42] and told you not today. You're not going
[1:32:44] to give into what the devil says. You're
[1:32:46] not going to buy the devil's gifts.
[1:32:48] You're not going to take that box of
[1:32:49] rattlesnakes. You're not going to sign
[1:32:51] for it.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Because saints, what we have to realize,
[1:32:54] and I know you know this, the problem is
[1:32:57] just temporary.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Weeping may endure for a night, but joy
[1:33:04] will come in the morning.
[1:33:06] [Music]
[1:33:07] Just hold on just a little while longer
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; because there's something on the inside
[1:33:12] of you that will not allow you to stay
[1:33:14] down.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; You tossing and turning on your bed and
[1:33:18] you're weeping and nobody knows, but God
[1:33:21] sees you. Just just hold on. Just get
[1:33:24] up.
[1:33:26] Amen.
[1:33:28] But the joy, I don't know where my son
[1:33:30] is. I don't know where my child is. You
[1:33:32] keep holding on. You keep praying.
[1:33:36] [Applause]
[1:33:38] G
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; something on the inside keeps working on
[1:33:41] the outside. Oh, what a change. Oh, what
[1:33:45] a change in my life.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; So, instead of connecting me to me or to
[1:33:51] my problem, what God does, he connects
[1:33:54] me to himself, which is the real me.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; I think of that song, if you want to see
[1:34:01] a miracle, just look around. You can
[1:34:04] look up. You can look down and then turn
[1:34:05] around and look at me. That's the
[1:34:08] miracle.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:15] You to you. If God connected you, if he
[1:34:18] kept you, which is what the devil does,
[1:34:19] the devil wants you to stay muddling
[1:34:21] around in that problem,
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; in that sin.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. in that abuse, in that violation,
[1:34:29] he wants you to stay there because if he
[1:34:31] can keep you connected to you, then
[1:34:34] you're going to stay where you
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; It's not about you. It's about him.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; So if he comes and lets us know that we
[1:34:42] are him, he's taking us beyond our
[1:34:45] situation,
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; going around and around. What did God
[1:34:48] tell Moses? gone around and around that
[1:34:50] that mountain time and time again. He
[1:34:52] said, "Moses, it's time to turn
[1:34:55] northward."
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've gone around this mountain
[1:35:00] long enough. Woman, here you are in the
[1:35:03] midst of this situation. You've gone
[1:35:06] through this problem enough, brother.
[1:35:08] Let it go.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. M Jesus has come once again to
[1:35:12] stoop in your situation to stoop to you
[1:35:16] man to let you see that I'm here
[1:35:20] to take care of this problem.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; And there's something as I was saying
[1:35:24] that that about seeing him that releases
[1:35:28] this ability within us to see who he
[1:35:31] really is in us. That's what he did for
[1:35:34] you. He stripped you of your
[1:35:36] identification. The problem is just
[1:35:38] temporary. Victory is already in you.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Deliverance is already in
[1:35:45] you. Healing is already in you.
[1:35:50] You just think you are a conqueror. The
[1:35:52] Bible says you've been made more than a
[1:35:55] conqueror.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8:37 speaks of that very
[1:36:00] thing. You've been made more than a
[1:36:02] conqueror.
[1:36:04] And that life that he was thinking of
[1:36:06] you is in you now.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Before the world ever began, he had a
[1:36:12] thought of you.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; And that little attribute is just today
[1:36:16] trying to declare itself. He say, "I I I
[1:36:18] don't know if I can go any further."
[1:36:20] It's just that little attribute. You're
[1:36:22] feeling something on the inside of you
[1:36:24] saying, "I need this that that brother's
[1:36:25] talking about." It's an attribute of
[1:36:27] eternity that's trying to declare
[1:36:29] itself.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Prophet tells a story about that little
[1:36:33] boy flying a kite and he that goes the
[1:36:35] man goes by and sees him the little boy
[1:36:36] out there and he's got a string in the
[1:36:38] tide and he looks up. He don't even see
[1:36:41] anything in because the kite's way
[1:36:42] beyond the clouds. And he asked the
[1:36:45] little boy, he said, "How do you know
[1:36:46] it's up there?"
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every now and again, I feel a
[1:36:50] little tug."
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Every now and again, I feel something
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; that lets me know that I can do this.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; The Christ in me has given me the
[1:36:59] victory. And quite frankly, the victory
[1:37:01] is already in me. Everything that you
[1:37:04] have need of for the journey is already
[1:37:07] in you.
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we're afraid to step out
[1:37:13] and go a little further. But I found
[1:37:14] this to be true. That if we take a
[1:37:17] little step, we find out, you know what,
[1:37:19] my territory is broadening.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; But if I stay here and don't ever move,
[1:37:23] we got some pretty views. We hear some
[1:37:26] fancy sermons, some fine word, we sing
[1:37:28] some victorious songs, but that's all
[1:37:31] that we see. But step out a little
[1:37:32] further and you'll find out there's a
[1:37:34] little more.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; There's a little more because eventually
[1:37:36] one day time is going to blend into
[1:37:39] eternity. And if we're not moving with
[1:37:41] the cloud, if we're not moving with the
[1:37:43] fire of God,
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; then we're going to miss it.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; You can stay in Sodom if you want to.
[1:37:51] You can look back all that you want to,
[1:37:52] but I'm getting out of here.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; So when we're in a situation, all it
[1:37:57] takes is a voice greater than that of
[1:37:59] our circumstance to make us aware of
[1:38:02] these things that's going on around us.
[1:38:04] It takes a voice greater than that of
[1:38:06] the enemy. It takes a voice greater than
[1:38:08] that of the devil.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Where was Eve? Why did she not Why was
[1:38:13] she not reminded? Why did something not
[1:38:16] pulsate within her to say, "I don't want
[1:38:19] to receive what you're telling me." In
[1:38:21] fact, why does she not turn and run?
[1:38:25] H because we find out that the serpent,
[1:38:29] he looked probably more handsome than
[1:38:31] Adam did.
[1:38:33] And and the prophet goes on to say that
[1:38:35] as he presented these things to her, she
[1:38:38] said, "My, wouldn't that be a thrill?"
[1:38:41] So what did he do? He tapped into her
[1:38:43] mind. And we live in an age now where
[1:38:46] everything is at our disposal.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; We carry hell around in our pockets.
[1:38:54] a little device and and it's so
[1:38:57] wonderful. They call it a smartphone.
[1:39:00] I call mine a smart alec phone. It knows
[1:39:04] more than I do. I ain't saying much.
[1:39:09] But this voice, saints,
[1:39:12] this voice is crying out to us today to
[1:39:15] let you know, woman, I'm here bowing.
[1:39:17] I'm stooping. I'm letting you know that
[1:39:19] this the noise that's going on in your
[1:39:21] heart, the noise that's going on in your
[1:39:23] mind, I'm here to silence that noise.
[1:39:28] St. John 14:12 says, "Verily, verily, I
[1:39:30] say unto you, he that believeth on me,
[1:39:32] the works that I do shall he do also,
[1:39:34] and greater works than these shall he
[1:39:35] do, because I go unto my father."
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; So, knowing who you are, listen, knowing
[1:39:41] who you are releases the power of God.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] Because eternity unites with eternity.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; When there's a deep within you calling
[1:39:53] out to something greater than you, there
[1:39:55] has to be a deep to respond.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; So the question now becomes to you. Are
[1:40:00] you crying out
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; or are you okay with where you are?
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Woman, you're in the midst of something
[1:40:07] greater. You're here, church. You're
[1:40:09] here today listening to me. Your
[1:40:11] deliverance, your salvation has come to
[1:40:14] you as a visitor.
[1:40:16] Your your your way out is here today.
[1:40:19] You don't have to leave those church
[1:40:21] doors the way that you came in. And
[1:40:23] quite frankly, you'll either leave
[1:40:24] better or worse. You cannot be the same.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Young people, you cannot be the same
[1:40:32] walking out these church doors.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. H and any man will never live any
[1:40:37] farther or any higher than what he
[1:40:40] believes he's a living
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; what he believes. So what do you believe
[1:40:44] about yourself?
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about just quoting the
[1:40:48] Bible, quoting scriptures and all these
[1:40:50] things. I'm talking about what do you
[1:40:51] believe the word says about you?
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; What is your personal understanding or
[1:40:57] revelation of who you are in the word of
[1:41:00] God? Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; I think of that old apostle song in the
[1:41:03] word of God. I've got a hiding place.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; So that's where I can hide. When
[1:41:09] troubles come, I can be found hidden in
[1:41:12] the word of God. I may not understand
[1:41:13] what's going on. I may not understand
[1:41:15] everything that's happening, but I'm
[1:41:16] hidden away. Hide me away, oh Lord.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Till the storm passes over.
[1:41:24] So,
[1:41:26] the thing that that that's comical to me
[1:41:28] is talking about, you know, what what we
[1:41:31] believe about ourselves. We can watch
[1:41:33] one YouTube video or one real and we'll
[1:41:37] come away thinking we're the best
[1:41:38] mechanic ever.
[1:41:41] That's me,
[1:41:44] man. I'm telling you, I've become a hero
[1:41:46] in the eyes of my wife so many times.
[1:41:49] Thank you, YouTube.
[1:41:53] But we will we we we will watch one
[1:41:55] little video and we we think we're the
[1:41:57] best carpenter ever. We think we're the
[1:41:59] best cook, the best chef.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; All because of one thing that we
[1:42:04] watched. We're the best entrepreneur. We
[1:42:06] get inspiration. We'll become a marathon
[1:42:08] runner. Woo! Be the best ever. I'm going
[1:42:10] to train and do all of these things all
[1:42:12] because we've watched something. And
[1:42:13] what did we do? We believed what we saw.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; I believe I can do that. Amen.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; But we said and we read this word, well,
[1:42:22] I don't know if that's for me. I I don't
[1:42:24] know if I can really do that. I don't
[1:42:25] know if that's for my children. No, it's
[1:42:27] for you. It's for your children. It's
[1:42:30] for your household.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; It's for this church.
[1:42:35] [Applause]
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; If we can do that in the natural,
[1:42:42] brothers, sisters, why can't we do it in
[1:42:44] the spiritual?
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:48] 2 plus two has always been four.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; That is simple math.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. Take God at his
[1:42:55] word and says, "Yes, that's me. Come on,
[1:42:57] let's go."
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; But when you believe you have, you say,
[1:43:04] "Yes, I am." Then you believe you're a
[1:43:05] Christian. You can't show nothing that
[1:43:08] you are, but you believe you are.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Listen, you believe you are. And then
[1:43:12] when you confess that you are and when
[1:43:15] you confess him and he confesses you,
[1:43:18] he's a high priest working on what? Not
[1:43:20] on your crying, not on your repenting,
[1:43:23] not on your faith, but on your
[1:43:26] confession.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; This word right here is dead.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; We can read it all day, all night.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; And look all sanctimonious and holy.
[1:43:37] Well, she reads her Bible all the time,
[1:43:40] but she ain't confessed one thing that's
[1:43:41] in this word.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; She walked around bound by spiritual
[1:43:46] depression.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; He still got a temper.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; But you're reading the word of God. But
[1:43:53] you have to be confessing these things.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; That's That's simple math right there.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; But what a scene, saints. What a scene.
[1:44:03] I'm I'm I'm closing. I'm I said that
[1:44:05] early, but but I am.
[1:44:06] We'll wind it down. But but what a scene
[1:44:10] that that what we have in our opening
[1:44:12] text. And they which heard it with being
[1:44:14] convicted by their own conscience went
[1:44:16] out one by one. Verse 10. And when Jesus
[1:44:19] had lifted himself up and saw none but
[1:44:21] the woman, he said unto her, "Woman,
[1:44:23] where are those thine accusers? Hath no
[1:44:26] man condemned thee?" Watch what she says
[1:44:29] now. She's she's in the midst of
[1:44:31] something greater than her. She's in the
[1:44:33] midst of something bigger than her
[1:44:35] problem.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; She she she she knows what she's been
[1:44:39] called in here for. She knows what she
[1:44:41] did. She knows what the Bible, the the
[1:44:43] Torah says should happen to her because
[1:44:46] of what she did. She's listening to the
[1:44:48] church folk tell her what she is and who
[1:44:52] she's who she is and what's going to
[1:44:53] happen to her. She's hearing all of
[1:44:55] these things, but then the word speaks
[1:44:57] to her. The word asks her a question.
[1:45:00] woman, where are thine accusers? I
[1:45:03] thought there was somebody. I thought
[1:45:04] there was a devil here whispering in
[1:45:06] your ear.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; She said, "No, man, Lord."
[1:45:13] And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I
[1:45:16] condemn thee. Go and sin no more." Go
[1:45:19] and stop missing the mark.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; That's what sin means, is to miss the
[1:45:25] mark.
[1:45:27] So here she has all these trappings and
[1:45:29] all these and no doubt she lived this
[1:45:32] lifestyle and had all of these abuses
[1:45:34] and violations brought against her time
[1:45:36] and time and time again. So much so she
[1:45:39] said this is how I'm going to be all my
[1:45:40] life.
[1:45:42] But when the word asked her the
[1:45:45] questions, where is that devil
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; that's been bothering you for weeks, for
[1:45:50] months, for years?
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; She says, God, I don't see a one. Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; I don't no doubt she looked around
[1:45:59] because she had already heard the clamor
[1:46:01] and probably because of the the the
[1:46:03] weightiness of it and what she was going
[1:46:05] through the the fear, she probably
[1:46:07] didn't even hear all of these guys after
[1:46:09] a certain moment cuz she was so afraid.
[1:46:12] She was about to die. But no doubt when
[1:46:14] God when Jesus asked her these words,
[1:46:16] "Woman, where are thine accusers?" She
[1:46:19] probably got a little still and began to
[1:46:22] look around. You know what that word
[1:46:26] says? I've been reading in my word and
[1:46:29] that word says that I don't have to be
[1:46:31] condemned.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; There are no accusers. There is no more
[1:46:35] devil woman in the midst. Everyone else
[1:46:39] was gone. She said, "No man, Lord, no
[1:46:43] devil, Lord."
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; It was just her and Jesus.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; And sometimes, Brother Gordon, that's
[1:46:51] what we have to do in a service. We have
[1:46:53] to shut everything out.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz maybe the kids have been acting up.
[1:46:59] Maybe you and your spouse has been
[1:47:00] arguing before church and they sitting
[1:47:02] beside you and I can't even raise my
[1:47:05] hand. Yes, you can.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; You have to raise your hand anyway.
[1:47:09] You're in here where you can get
[1:47:11] deliverance.
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:14] where you can get victory
[1:47:17] and be able to say if they can shout
[1:47:20] acting like that, I'm going to shout
[1:47:22] too.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show that devil that I have
[1:47:26] victory.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Because it was just her and Jesus shut
[1:47:33] in with God in a secret place. Is that
[1:47:38] all right? Shut in with him. No man,
[1:47:41] Lord, not only had the physical
[1:47:43] appearance and presence of her accusers
[1:47:46] been deleted, but her guilt and
[1:47:49] everything that that attached itself to
[1:47:52] her had been eradicated.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; All of it, huh? All of it was gone. Even
[1:47:59] her acceptance of what they had said she
[1:48:01] was was gone. Even the everything that
[1:48:04] she had accepted in the past of what the
[1:48:07] devil said that she was had been
[1:48:09] deleted.
[1:48:11] No more trace.
[1:48:13] They were gone, but they were not gone.
[1:48:16] Because you see, the devil's going to be
[1:48:17] right outside those. In fact, the
[1:48:18] devil's still here whisping in your ear
[1:48:20] now.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; But they were gone, but yet they were
[1:48:23] not gone. And no doubt, as I said
[1:48:25] earlier, she had prepared herself to
[1:48:27] die. She had prepared herself. Well, I
[1:48:30] might as well just give into this. this
[1:48:32] is the way I'm always going to be. My
[1:48:33] mama was, my daddy was, my uncle was, my
[1:48:35] grandmama was, all of these things. And
[1:48:38] this was some major stuff, saints, that
[1:48:40] she had done. Stuff such that she did by
[1:48:44] the law deserve to die. It wasn't like
[1:48:47] like, you know, sneaking out of out
[1:48:49] after curfew or something like that.
[1:48:51] Now, I know y'all young people had never
[1:48:53] Well, I know you old folk never done
[1:48:55] anything like that. Sneak out after
[1:48:56] curfew.
[1:48:58] Ah, sure. Okay. But it was it was
[1:49:02] greater than that. It wasn't some little
[1:49:04] small infraction
[1:49:05] because her sin was great. But saints,
[1:49:08] her forgiveness was greater
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; than her sin.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; She could have held on to her guilt. She
[1:49:17] could have held on to that shame which
[1:49:19] would have only trapped her further in
[1:49:21] that condition because she had become no
[1:49:24] doubt a prisoner in her ma mind bound by
[1:49:27] circumstances. Nobody knows that weight
[1:49:30] that you're carrying.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; You've not told anybody that wound, that
[1:49:34] scar, who did what to you, who said what
[1:49:36] to you. You've been holding that for
[1:49:38] years. I'm here to let you know, sis.
[1:49:39] I'm here to let you know, brother. You
[1:49:41] can lay it all at at the feet of Christ
[1:49:43] today. You don't have to walk out of
[1:49:45] here with that anymore.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; A prisoner in your mind. And and you
[1:49:50] know what's interesting is maybe as she
[1:49:52] walked out of the the the the church
[1:49:54] house that day, she no doubt maybe even
[1:49:57] saw some of her accusers because they
[1:50:00] probably they couldn't no longer be in
[1:50:01] the presence of Jesus because there's
[1:50:03] something about the presence of God that
[1:50:05] that that scatters demons and and no
[1:50:08] doubt they they were just waiting
[1:50:09] outside to see what was going to happen
[1:50:11] cuz they know it's just him and her in
[1:50:12] there and they're going to see is he
[1:50:13] going to stone her? Is he going to get
[1:50:15] rid of her? What is he going to do to
[1:50:16] her because of what she did? And no
[1:50:18] doubt they were waiting and watching.
[1:50:19] And when she walked out, she no doubt
[1:50:22] saw some of the very guys that had just
[1:50:24] accused her as soon as she stepped out
[1:50:26] of those temple doors. H the devil is
[1:50:29] real.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; But what she attached herself to was not
[1:50:35] so much what she was seeing, but what
[1:50:38] she had said. And that was no man. born.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; She had identified so much with that
[1:50:45] word that she took on the very nature,
[1:50:48] the very voice, the very embodiment of
[1:50:51] that word. And as she said, "No man,
[1:50:54] Lord," that identified something in
[1:50:57] eternity that let her know that you no
[1:50:59] longer have to walk with your head down
[1:51:01] in shame because I've come and I've
[1:51:03] stooped in your presence.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; And the presence of God, I believe, has
[1:51:06] come this day. And he stooped once again
[1:51:09] to let you know that the clamor, the
[1:51:11] noise, all of the heightened confusion
[1:51:14] that's been on your heart, that's been
[1:51:16] raging in your mind, you no longer have
[1:51:19] to accept that.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Because what was she doing? She was
[1:51:25] holding on to something. Listen, you're
[1:51:27] holding on to something that's going to
[1:51:29] kill you.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; You better let that thing go.
[1:51:35] He said, "Brother Joel, that's a mighty
[1:51:36] bold thing to say." It is a mighty bold
[1:51:38] thing to say, but the power of God is
[1:51:41] great.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; If I don't believe that this word can
[1:51:45] deliver, then I'll just close my Bible
[1:51:47] and never preach, never sing another
[1:51:48] victorious song again. This there's
[1:51:51] power in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:53] There's power in this word. All that we
[1:51:56] have to do is not read it only, but
[1:51:58] confess it.
[1:52:01] And when the devil comes saying, "Well,
[1:52:03] weren't you such and such and weren't
[1:52:05] you so and so? I was there when you did
[1:52:07] that. In fact, I was the one that made
[1:52:08] you do that." You can look him and go
[1:52:10] toe-to-toe with the devil and say, "No,
[1:52:13] man, devil."
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Nobody is going to be able to keep me
[1:52:18] down. Not even you.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; But her confession is what rendered her
[1:52:24] free.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? What are you
[1:52:28] confessing?
[1:52:30] Are the words that you're speaking
[1:52:32] condemning you or constraining you even
[1:52:34] more in that condition? Or are the words
[1:52:37] you speaking setting you free,
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; giving you liberty?
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; I'm here to proclaim today that the
[1:52:44] words that you speak from now on should
[1:52:46] be those that's going to set you free.
[1:52:49] You don't have to wait for brother
[1:52:50] Simmons to come, but we don't have to
[1:52:52] wait for some preacher to come and lay
[1:52:53] hands on it. You can speak a word of
[1:52:55] truth and deliverance over yourself.
[1:52:59] Because sometimes there's nobody around
[1:53:01] to encourage you. So what do you have to
[1:53:03] do? Good job, brother Joel.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Good job. You did great today in Christ
[1:53:08] Jesus. The word that's in you.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Sod toe-to-toe with the devil.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Call brother Simmons as a busy signal.
[1:53:18] Huh? He didn't call you back in time. My
[1:53:21] goodness. She was holding on to what was
[1:53:23] going to kill her. Genesis 3:13. And the
[1:53:26] Lord God said unto the woman, "What is
[1:53:28] this that thou hast done?" And the woman
[1:53:30] said, "The serpent beguiled me, and I
[1:53:33] did eat." So she started playing the
[1:53:36] blame game. Well, it was because if my
[1:53:37] daddy hadn't done it, if my if my mama
[1:53:39] hadn't blah blah blah, and if my brother
[1:53:41] hadn't, if my sister hadn't playing the
[1:53:43] blame game. So just as this woman in the
[1:53:46] temple that day was asked a question,
[1:53:48] Eve was also asked a very specific
[1:53:52] question. Amen.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Hath no man condemned thee?
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; So when you have truth,
[1:54:02] when truth is given to you, there is
[1:54:04] power in even few words.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; So Eve took her question and she played
[1:54:13] the blame game.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; And this lady in the New Testament when
[1:54:18] she was given a question, she said no to
[1:54:21] the devil. Amen.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; H simple a big question but a simple
[1:54:27] response because you have to realize
[1:54:29] when you have truth there is power in
[1:54:32] even few words
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; and sometimes consequently there's power
[1:54:37] even in this right here and we all we
[1:54:39] all need to learn this one.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; What did mama say back in the day? Zip
[1:54:45] it.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Zip it. Put a lock on it. Amen.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get ourselves in situation
[1:54:53] because of this old thing right here.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Scourge, put your brakes on, brother
[1:54:58] Joel.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Don't want to go there.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; You listen. You are not defined by what
[1:55:08] you've done.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Woman in the midst,
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; you are not defined by what others say
[1:55:17] you are.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:19] God defines you.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Are you an eternal creature or are you
[1:55:24] an eternal creature? That is your
[1:55:28] identification. We are just here in time
[1:55:30] and in this little hickey of time and
[1:55:32] eventually time is going to blend back
[1:55:34] up into eternity. And the only things
[1:55:37] that are of eternal quality are going to
[1:55:41] walk on streets of gold.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil wants nothing more
[1:55:45] than to get you to think that this is
[1:55:47] all that you're going to get. Some
[1:55:49] people even go so far as to say that
[1:55:50] this is the millennium. I say hogwash.
[1:55:54] Because they woke up this morning and
[1:55:55] their breath was stinking.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; They had matter in their eyes, hairs all
[1:56:00] over their head. That's not eternity.
[1:56:02] That's not the new life.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; That's still here in time.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; He defines who you are. Now don't worry
[1:56:10] about what you've done. This girl
[1:56:13] didn't. Yes, it might have been bad.
[1:56:15] What you've done might have even been
[1:56:17] embarrassing,
[1:56:19] shameful, but remember Jesus made his
[1:56:22] reputation among people who did bad
[1:56:25] things, too.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks of those things that he
[1:56:31] made his reputation among those type of
[1:56:32] people. But what I want you to do just
[1:56:35] for a moment, just take a moment and
[1:56:37] think about I'm not I'm not conjuring up
[1:56:38] anything in anything bad or evil spirits
[1:56:41] or anything, but think about something
[1:56:42] that you're holding on to right now
[1:56:44] that's bad. H it's quiet, isn't it?
[1:56:49] Some maybe some besetting sin or
[1:56:52] something that that only you do in the
[1:56:53] privacy of your room where nobody's
[1:56:55] around.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[1:56:58] Got it. Jesus died for that.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. Yes.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus hung on the cross for that. Yes,
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus took stripes upon his back for
[1:57:08] that.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus gave his very life for that.
[1:57:13] That thing that you think that you
[1:57:15] cannot get rid of. Jesus Christ died for
[1:57:19] that.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; There's room at the cross.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 6:11. And such were some
[1:57:27] of you were past tense. But ye are
[1:57:31] washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye
[1:57:35] are justified in the name of the Lord
[1:57:38] Jesus and by the spirit of God.
[1:57:41] He does his best work with some of the
[1:57:46] most vilest of situations.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; He does because I know what he did for
[1:57:53] me.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; He went and gave his life for me. If
[1:57:57] only but for one, he would have gone
[1:57:59] just for one.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; If that one would have been you, he
[1:58:04] would have done it.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; But his love stretched forth even
[1:58:08] greater that he would even come into
[1:58:11] time and set foot in a body on this
[1:58:15] cursed earth in order to redeem not only
[1:58:19] the body but the earth too. Everything
[1:58:22] about eternity is going back to
[1:58:25] eternity. taking on that identification.
[1:58:27] Let us bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:58:29] we as the musicians come. We thank you
[1:58:31] for your word today.
[1:58:34] And Lord, we pray that this woman that's
[1:58:38] gathered here this day could really see
[1:58:41] what's going on around her and who she
[1:58:43] is in the midst of. And I know that
[1:58:47] there are those that are here today that
[1:58:50] think that they will always be the way
[1:58:52] that they've been. But Lord, today is a
[1:58:55] new day.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Your mercies are new every day as we
[1:58:59] know. A new opportunity to see who you
[1:59:02] really are.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; And so when the enemy comes in like a
[1:59:05] flood, and we know that he will. We know
[1:59:06] that he has.
[1:59:09] Lord, your word tells us that a standard
[1:59:12] would be raised.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; And oh God, we can find ourselves hidden
[1:59:16] behind that standard. So Lord, hide me
[1:59:19] away in that. Oh Lord, let me not
[1:59:22] proclaim who I think that I am, but
[1:59:26] Lord, let me proclaim what your word
[1:59:27] says that I am. My identity is in you,
[1:59:31] Father. Lord, if there be any here
[1:59:33] today, Lord, still yet holding on to
[1:59:35] something, Lord, in their lives that
[1:59:37] they need to be freed from, may you just
[1:59:40] nudge up a little closer to them and let
[1:59:43] them know it's going to be okay. I'm
[1:59:46] here and I've stooped for you.
[1:59:50] And as I've stooped, you can stoop too
[1:59:53] when the devil comes. So Lord, let
[1:59:56] victory reign in the camp today. We love
[1:59:59] you and we thank you for all that you
[2:00:02] are. And we thank you for this service
[2:00:04] this day. bless the saints here, the
[2:00:06] leadership, the pastor and his wife and
[2:00:11] all the helps here and what everything
[2:00:13] that goes on. The the sound folk, the
[2:00:17] musicians,
[2:00:19] those that come to clap their hands, to
[2:00:21] pat their foot, to say an amen, to raise
[2:00:24] their hands in victory. We thank you for
[2:00:27] that, Father. May it ever be a
[2:00:29] lighthouse for those wandering spirits,
[2:00:31] those wandering souls.
[2:00:34] And Lord, as the neighborhoods around
[2:00:36] and individuals come, I just pray that
[2:00:39] there will be such a an illumination to
[2:00:42] go forth from the word that they will be
[2:00:45] able to understand and see as it was
[2:00:48] with the woman at the well that day. She
[2:00:50] didn't know that eternal life lay within
[2:00:52] her because of time and the trappings of
[2:00:55] time and everything, God, that she had
[2:00:58] become.
[2:01:00] But Lord, you in love
[2:01:03] had to go by that whale that day.
[2:01:07] And I'm convinced so much, Lord,
[2:01:08] sometimes what we call inconvenience is
[2:01:11] really divine intervention.
[2:01:13] And Lord, you lay upon our heart to
[2:01:15] reach out to someone and we'll say, "I
[2:01:17] don't want to call them. They're going
[2:01:19] to think that I'm meddling or think I'm
[2:01:21] being nosy." But Lord, as I say so
[2:01:25] often, the devil's not going to do
[2:01:27] something like that. That's you
[2:01:30] getting an individual to be loved to
[2:01:32] somebody that needs to be loved. That's
[2:01:35] you giving turning on the switch of that
[2:01:39] light in order that that person can be a
[2:01:42] little illuminator to someone that's in
[2:01:44] darkness.
[2:01:45] It's not just up for the ministry to do
[2:01:47] these things, but this is a body move.
[2:01:50] We're all collectively, Lord, as a body,
[2:01:53] Lord, going to be changed one day. And
[2:01:55] so Lord, until that time comes, may I be
[2:01:59] a lover of humanity.
[2:02:02] May I be an illuminator of those in
[2:02:04] darkness.
[2:02:06] May I be a lifegiver to those who think
[2:02:10] and feel as though they have no life.
[2:02:12] We're all humans here. We all have
[2:02:14] seasons of ups and downs. So Lord, may
[2:02:18] we all be in our proper position doing
[2:02:20] the things that we need. When one's up
[2:02:22] and one's down, the one that's up can
[2:02:25] pull the other that's down that's up.
[2:02:27] Father, so help us. May we not get weary
[2:02:29] in our welloing. We love you. We thank
[2:02:31] you for all that you've done for us. And
[2:02:33] it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:02:36] Amen. Amen. Let us stand.
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:43] I love you, Jesus.
[2:02:48] I worship and adore you.
[2:02:53] Just want to tell you
[2:02:56] that I love you more than anything.
[2:03:07] I love you, Jesus.
[2:03:11] [Music]
[2:03:12] I worship and adore you.
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; That I love you more than anything.
[2:03:27] [Applause]
[2:03:29] I love you, Jesus.
[2:03:32] I love you, Jesus.
[2:03:37] [Music]
[2:03:40] I worship and adore you. And I want to
[2:03:44] tell you that I love you more,
[2:03:49] more than anything.
[2:03:55] Oh,
[2:03:57] I love you, Jesus.
[2:04:02] I worship and
[2:04:05] adore you.
[2:04:13] [Music]
[2:04:16] Hey, I love you, Jesus.
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:21] I worship and adore you.
[2:04:26] Just want to tell you.
[2:04:35] Amen. Amen.
[2:04:40] confession. There's power in confession.
[2:04:44] There's power in confession and
[2:04:47] forgiveness.
[2:04:49] Cuz sometimes you can confess something
[2:04:50] that you've done to somebody genuinely
[2:04:54] and they may not forgive you and you're
[2:04:57] still bound by that. You think, "Well, I
[2:04:59] was sincere."
[2:05:01] But when we confess sin to God,
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; that sin doesn't belong to you anymore.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; You can let it go. You can forget about
[2:05:11] it because you know that he has accepted
[2:05:14] that. Amen. Just take it to him. Let's
[2:05:17] just sing one more before we go.
[2:05:20] Let me hear C. Put C in my ear. Maybe I
[2:05:22] think
[2:05:26] where do I go? Maybe not. Where do I go
[2:05:31] when there's nobody else to turn to? And
[2:05:35] who do I turn to
[2:05:40] when nobody wants to listen? And who do
[2:05:44] I lean on?
[2:05:47] When there's no foundation stable, I go
[2:05:51] to the rock. I know God is able. I go to
[2:05:55] the rock.
[2:05:58] I go to the rock.
[2:06:02] I go to the stone that the builders
[2:06:04] rejected. I run to the mountain and the
[2:06:08] mountains
[2:06:10] stand by me.
[2:06:12] When the earth all around me is sinking
[2:06:16] sand on Christ is solid.
[2:06:20] When I need a shelter, when I need a
[2:06:23] friend, I go I go to the rock. Oh,
[2:06:27] I go to the rock.
[2:06:31] I go to the stone at the building.
[2:06:40] Stand by me.
[2:06:42] When the earth all around me is sinking
[2:06:45] sand on Christ's solid solid rock I
[2:06:49] stand. When I need a shelter, when I
[2:06:52] need a friend, I go to the rock.
[2:06:57] Go to the rock.
[2:07:02] I go I go
[2:07:06] I go to the rock.
[2:07:09] I can go to the rock.
[2:07:13] I find myself
[2:07:17] in the way in that secret place. He is
[2:07:21] my rock.
[2:07:23] He is my shelter.
[2:07:27] I go to the rock.
[2:07:31] I go to the rock.
[2:07:35] I go to the rock.
[2:07:40] The earth all around me is sinking sand.
[2:07:44] All right.
[2:08:08] Amen.
[2:08:11] Woman in the midst. Amen. Let's bow our
[2:08:14] heads.
[2:08:16] Heavenly Father,
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; oh Lord, we just thank you for the word
[2:08:20] that we heard. Lord Jesus,
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; the little song, oh God, came in our
[2:08:25] mind.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; As he was talking about Jesus stooping
[2:08:29] down,
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; I said he took my place this morning.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Oh God, when I look at Calvary,
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; oh Jesus,
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for the word this
[2:08:41] morning. Yes.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, oh God, because I know that
[2:08:45] you spoke to somebody.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; I know that you're calling somebody.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; The word don't be just come like that
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; without a purpose.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; I believe this morning
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; that God is calling somebody.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; The devil's telling you you ain't no
[2:09:05] good.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Telling you you don't have no right to
[2:09:08] praise God.
[2:09:10] But he took your place.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; He was whipped. He was spit on.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; You can go free this morning and worship
[2:09:21] the living God.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Won't you come to God this morning?
[2:09:28] Somebody come this morning.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody make their way.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Down that lonely road to Calvary.
[2:09:38] Oh Jesus.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Bless your children.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Don't let it pass you by.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Reach out.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Reach out right now.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:57] Somebody worship God this morning.
[2:10:00] Somebody worship God in their own way.
[2:10:06] If you want prayer, you can come this
[2:10:08] morning as our brother sings. If you
[2:10:11] want prayer, you can come this morning.
[2:10:13] Amen.
[2:10:18] Amen.
[2:10:19] God is good. Amen.
[2:10:21] [Music]
[2:10:25] I said I believe God is calling somebody
[2:10:27] this morning. The word don't just come
[2:10:30] that plain without a purpose.
[2:10:33] But God is letting somebody know the
[2:10:36] devil saying all kind of things about
[2:10:37] you that you can't make it, that you
[2:10:39] ain't no good. But Jesus died for your
[2:10:42] sins. Come on. Not the church, not a
[2:10:46] man, but Jesus died for you this
[2:10:48] morning. And all you got to do is make
[2:10:50] your way. Press your way. God, I'm
[2:10:53] coming. Hallelujah. As our brother sings
[2:10:56] this morning,
[2:10:58] [Music]
[2:11:13] Oh,
[2:11:14] [Applause]
[2:11:16] you
[2:11:23] [Applause]
[2:11:46] Heat.
[2:11:52] Heat.
[2:12:04] [Music]
[2:12:08] Heat.
[2:12:12] Heat.
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:22] Yeah.
[2:12:34] Heat.
[2:12:44] Yeah.
[2:12:53] Heat.
[2:13:18] Heat
[2:13:21] up
[2:13:24] here.
[2:13:34] [Music]
[2:13:45] Heat
[2:13:48] up here.
[2:13:51] [Music]
[2:14:19] Amen.
[2:14:22] Y'all appreciate the word this morning.
[2:14:24] I do believe with all of my heart that
[2:14:28] was a word sent from God this morning.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; To speak to somebody.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; But the word can only work.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; It's a seed. It's got to be planted on
[2:14:37] good ground.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; The devil don't want you to hear. He
[2:14:40] don't want you to believe it.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; But if you take it and believe it, watch
[2:14:45] things begin to move.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so many mountains that the
[2:14:49] devil got in your way. Yes.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; But if you can only grasp just that
[2:14:53] little bit
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; that God, you already made the way.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; You already done it. You need healing,
[2:14:59] God's already healed you. Need
[2:15:01] salvation. He's already saved. He's
[2:15:03] already done it. Everything that you
[2:15:05] need is in him.
[2:15:08] Come on. And the devil don't want you to
[2:15:10] confess that. But you got to walk in the
[2:15:13] power of God. Walk confessing every day.
[2:15:16] Lord is mine. Thank you. Come on. Oh
[2:15:20] Jesus. You know God will do something
[2:15:22] for you. How many believe that this
[2:15:24] morning? Come on. God is good. Amen.
[2:15:28] God is good. Don't know how to close.
[2:15:30] Amen. God is good. It's our brother
[2:15:33] Gordon. Come and sing us a song. Come
[2:15:36] and close us. Come on. Come on. Brother
[2:15:39] Gordon. Y'all feel all right this
[2:15:40] morning? God is good. Amen. Thank the
[2:15:44] Lord. Amen.
[2:15:50] Amen. Praise the Lord. We just do a
[2:15:51] little quick chorus. Amen. Let's just
[2:15:54] turn it over to Jesus. That's what he
[2:15:56] said this morning. Give it to him. Amen.
[2:15:58] Turn it over to Jesus. And we just
[2:16:00] missed. Turn it over to Jesus.
[2:16:05] Turn it over to Jesus and you will smile
[2:16:11] rest of the day.
[2:16:16] Turn it over to Jesus.
[2:16:19] Turn it over to Jesus.
[2:16:29] The rest of the day
