Chapter like to thank the Lord for having with us this morning Dr Charity Beth praise [Applause] God I said Simmons white amen glad to have her and with her and her family glad to have all of you this morning amen 19 and uh 16 and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there's none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments he said unto him which Jesus said thou shallal not do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal thou shall not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself the young man said unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lath I yet Jesus said unto him If thy will be perfect go and sell that thou has and give to the poor and thou shallal have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had what God bless you may you be you may be seated amen we were just speaking at brother funeral the other day and we was talking about eternal life so we want to continue on on that but like to say you know the world around is celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ we understand that Jesus you know wasn't born in the winter like it is now cuz the Shepherds wouldn't be in the field but we understand that Pagan Rome came in and and the through through the Roman Catholic Church they bought in Pagan Rome teaching which was the ladi's day which was the son God birthday not the Son of God but the son God Amen but a lot of traditions have have been handed down for years and years and people just traditionally do things because it's tradition and some people don't understand and some children may think oh this is Jesus birthday it's not Jesus birthday it's just tradition that they say are you with me so a lot of traditions like Thanksgiving and you know Mother's Day and Father's Day and sister brother day a lot of things people keep and we don't say nothing about but we want you to have understanding amen and we thank God that Jesus was born if the world want to recognize it then thank the Lord amen that Jesus was born and the purpose of him being born was not for us amen the you know so much as if people want to do good things and give to one another thank God do that every day but if you want to do it on a special day doing good wein got no problem with that but understand that you know what truth is amen you should know the truth and the truth shall what that's right amen and you know there ain't no Santa Claus are you with me uh okay God bless you let me go and get in the word God is all right amen somebody said well I give a gift that's all right I ain't got nothing do what you just tradition amen just don't worship the day you know the Bible said the wise men they came to worship Jesus amen when they saw him they worship him they didn't worship the star but they worship him we know that when the wise man got there was two he was about two years old when the wise men that followed the star when they got there he was about 2 years old but when the Shepherds that were in the field when they Angels met them and told them they SP them in the mansion that's why it had to be Shepherds right so the Shepherds and the wise men is two different occasions are you with me so when you see this uh wise men coming with the gift and the baby no he was two years old then you know what I'm saying but the Shepherds they came and he was in the Mangia right so God bless you amen we said those things because somebody else will tell you and you say well I didn't know that yeah you knew it so we we let you know amen cuz I I I guarantee you jov witness knocking on everybody door telling them what I'm what I'm telling y'all and they use that time to convert a lot of people cuz people go to church and they said well I've been Tau uh no you know the truth amen and a lot of people are become Jehovah Witness a seven day Venice at that time because nobody told them right but when you have been taught the truth you know about these things okay I don't know how to start but I'll start he said here it says good Master you know eternal life do you have it eternal life that's the question I like to ask and I want you to think about it do you have eternal life the next question is you know sometimes we we want to know what is eternal life what is eternal life do I have it you know most of the time we think about life insurance and everybody you know sometimes we have people die and they don't have no insurance and we all strapped together and try to uh pay for for their funeral and burier you know because they don't have life insurance that kind of life insurance you have life insurance then you get a beneficiary are you with me now the the life insurance uh the people pay for that life insurance sometime for 20 30 40 50 years you know and a lot of times that's how people become millionaires they get it when they young and they don't pay much for it and if they happen to die they want to leave you know 10 million or five million they want to die quick so they want their family to be millionaires and the family hoping they hir up and die if he got $10 million wor you know the children won't their parents to die die quick you got $10 million pocy so you better not tell them but if you got a million dollar policy let's just think within realistical terms you got a million dollar policy and you pay for that policy because you want to leave your family in inheritance not me now you know I got to be guilty I didn't leave that okay but if you wise you know you can do that and your children can become instant me iones well if you if you're young now get old like me you can't afford the policy almost and nobody want to sell you one cuz they ain't expecting you to live long enough for them to benefit from you having a million dollar policy are you with me so I'm saying uh eternal life you know the young man had a good question good Master what I got to do I want it he must have eternal life because it was something that he wanted are you with me he must have considered eternal life because amen it was something that he asked I what what can I do you know what I want to know what can I do but to uh most of us eternal life is not valuable it has no value to it so eternal life that has no value to it then uh why you want it so most people don't want it because it it is of no value only when uh when they on their death bed that they realize I don't want to die it doesn't matter sometimes how sick an individual is it's something about dying that they don't want to do it's only those that have a e eternal life that don't mind dying they if I got to die then let me die even the knowing that it's something about life that you don't I mean you value you want to live a little little while longer so if the doctor say you have this kind of sickness or this kind of disease you got to take this kind of medicine maybe you got to go on dialysis maybe you got to uh take a a blood then maybe you got to do this or that then you say well doctor I want to live so whatever I got to take my high blood pressure medicine I got to do this I got to go to dialysis I want to live a couple days longer Lord what whatever I got to do doc I'll do it but this man was concerned this young man uh this young man was concerned about more than just uh living a few days longer he wanted eternal life amen then he said what good thing you know I I know I got I got to do some good thing you know he said what good thing can I do that that I can have it and a lot of people are doing good things cuz they want eternal life so they try to do good things they try you know to help folk you know you know I getting a cup of coffee and the man come out oh uh you know this this holiday season give him a few dollars give him you know sometime you might give a man5 $10 oning the holiday season feel pretty good the spirit get on you you knowing it it's giving time he must have know how to do it you know this good season you know I I I at McDonald's and this a nice person I go there and get my coffee I I said I told my wife get that lady $5 she said you know she she waved at me thank you I said you know I it's holiday season she need a little encouragement give her a little something amen give her $5 she thank you friend she call me friend thank you friend you know you know you make everybody it's time to make let everybody cheer up this holiday season you know we want to make you get you know think about you know little F fell on the corner with the bag out you used to drive by the inside of a man that I want to do something good and and it's nothing wrong with doing good things but he said what good thing can I do cuz I want some for it you know people ain't just doing good things for nothing they wanton they want to they want there you know if I leave here I want somebody to say Amen in my community I was a good neighbor evil I did good things I want you know I want my S the sisters the brothers uh fraternity brother to tell about how what we did we we we did some stuff they Ain tell about all the other stuff now we got drunk together and all that but tell them about the good thing we did so but those good things that we do what good thing can I do that I might have eternal life I want know what good thing can I do you know and I I I'm sure a a lot of us you know sometimes we get in the point that we want to do something good amen that we might have eternal life and that we might please God what good thing can I do so Jesus said okay since you ask that let me tell you what you can do you know some I'm going tell you of them this young man probably out done most of us in the church if you look down the list some one of those things you might be guilty of or if you w if you ain't guilty of it today sometime in your life as a young person you were guilty come on you young people look at this is a young man now you know if you read up these things that you and me and some of y'all I hope one of Y one of y'all might can miss it but I doubt it you know what I'm saying what you know if you ain't never stole took something mama told you not to take an extra biscuit maybe a piece of pie you know say you did something but this young man said all this good I I did this for my youth up I did good stuff oh goodness you know one one one writer said Jesus loved him he's a good boy I'm going tell you something uh now some of us ain't been so good and and Jesus don't be upset with us but this boy Jesus loved him but he you know he probably thought man I'm cool I done done everything I'm all right you know I I'm just coming asking but I I I know I'm I know saved you know how it is I know I'm saved I'm just coming to church preacher you can't save me I I'm good I got mine I got good religion you know sometimes we feel like amen we deserve heaven we deserve eternal life we feel like amen man I'm all right I'm a Christian I'm saved I deserve eternal life man good religious fellow good uh what we call good save moral fellow amen he wasn't like some of us we we was so moral everything just fit perfectly we we made mistakes we did stuff that we ashamed of right but this fell was a good fell didn't do none of that stuff we did okay but one thing he said the young man you know young man said unto him all these things the 21st young man said unto him uh all these things have I kept for my youth up then he you know he asked the question now now now now oh you know he think he got it he said what huh he must have know he was missing something else he said what come on y'all read it y'all can look at it it's up there what it say what you liking what read it y y'all read it one time somebody ain't going to read some of y'all that didn't read it read it out loud and and take it personal read it yeah I ain't see so much by the mouth open I was looking at a certain person certain young person and I wanted to hear him read you see what I'm saying but they won't do it now cuz I I don't want to I don't want this thing to get to me so I ain't going to read it I'm just going to sit here nobody see me I see you I see you you know don't be scared the word ain't going to hurt you it'll do you good you know some sometimes it's a medicine that's going to do us good I used to hate the winter time come Mama used to take that cast star every time got oh that Castor was something it want you to take that Castor and give you a little orange to go with it man how many y'all old time used to take that Castor I don't know if Lord still remember Lord you remember that Castor why we just give that cast Lord have Mery that was some nasty stuff but they wanted you to keep from getting flu and all that I don't know some of us my niece and Castor but it sometime the thing that going to do you good it might you you might not like it might not even want it but the thing that's going to do you good amen what lacketh I I I I believe many people come to church think they got it all under control I ain't lacking nothing I Got It Made amen I know I know that I know that I know but this young man which was living a better life life than most Christian that we know he had it he had it all together but he realized what lath I okay now this is what Jesus said unto him If thy will be what if you want to be perfect now okay I'm going to get down to your situation I know I I know what you got I'm going to tell you Jesus knows amen that those little secret places those little things that amen that you think you got covered all up he knows where it's at are you with me so he says if thou will be perfect go and what oh where your treasure is there where your what hard me also he he knows what what what you're holding on to right so he said says and I don't want you to give it to me he said give it to the what give it to the PO see sometime you know uh we we think we going to do something for the church or do something for God he said no no give it to the pole don't give it to me give it to the pole are you with me see I don't I I don't want you to come to church give it to the pole amen okay and thou shall have what Treasures in Heaven oh Lord now eternal life comes with some benefits I want you to know it's valuable eternal life come with Benefits he told our young man you going to have what Treasures in Heaven some Treasures y'all know if we can find a good treasure amen and and it's got all kind of gold and diamonds and stuff like that Treasures in Heaven benefits I said you can die and your mom and daddy could have a million dollar policy on them and you can get become a millionaire but it ain't nothing compared to having Treasures in Heaven why because the streets are there are what paid with go so it's a difference between having Treasures here and having Treasures in Heaven eternal life I want it I want it what about you do you want it the young man wanted it and you can have Treasures trees in heaven now now notice Jesus was telling him you know he now where your treasure is that where your heart going to be also are you with me watch it watch it where your trages is that where your heart going to be can we bring it home oh y'all ready okay let's let's bring it on he said and come and what follow me see in order to follow him you got to lose your treasure in order to be perfect you got to lose your treasure the thing that's important and valuable to you the thing that oh I'm going tell you what the young man did the TW young what what did the young man do 22 but when the young man heard that sing he what think I'm going give it up you believe that I'm really going to give this my treasures up all this I done work for leave it for all this that I got you really want me to give that up I don't know my question I said Lord you know I want to speak on jesus' birth but I said I got to be obedient to you you know he said my question was what are you holding on to he said for he had great what he had great POS he had a I mean he has great possession what is your great great possession that you holding on to that you you you don't want to give it up for eternal life what what is it what is it your great possession he had great I tell you he had more money than you he had probably more Prestige than everything that he had more than you he had great possession but he was willing to come to Jesus and ask for something that he thought was more valuable but he realized that this is a tough one this is really serious business and am I really going to give up my great possession to for a possession a treasure that's in heaven you know somebody said I want mine now I I I want I want my now eternal life yeah but I want to I I want to live while I'm living and I want to now I want to enjoy myself right now and if I hold on to what I got it's going to make me happy and I'm going hold on to it because I want mine now Heaven can come later but I got to have mine right now amen your great possession could be your friends most of them ain't got no money so it ain't your money you ain't got enough of it if you was to had money you wouldn't be here to being one those those Prestige churches we all the big shots here you know what I'm talking about place wouldn't be a place to come into it it don't look nice enough are you with me great possession the devil must don't want somebody to hear usually I don't have to drink no water I had to drink some water on that are y'all withing people are struggling they're bounding with great possession said man I ain't got nothing you know you got enough you got something you got something that keeping you back that causing you not to have eternal life see what the devil is fighting ain't it y'all praying it must be getting home all the demons out of hell don't want you to have it but God wants you to have it Satan in all his demons don't want you to have eternal life but God want you to have it are you with me what great possession think about it think about it what great possession that that missed me I ain't got nothing great just just just just move the great out the way and just put possession but the reason why he said great because the man had a lot most of us just say that part right there you can leave out possession but great I ain't got nothing great but I got possession what do what's possessing you that you don't want to give up that thing that's possess you are you willing to give up the thing that's possessing you you see what I'm saying not a devil the man was possessed with Devils Mary Magdalene had seven devils are you with me but you can give up whatever is presession you and you can give up your possessions the thing that you you treasure the thing that you value the thing that causes you not to have eternal life and it keep you from going to heaven keep you from inheriting the kingdom of heaven that I want to walk the streets of gold I want to hear him say Well done good and faithful seron enter into the joy of the Lord one day this life will be over and I wanted him say when I take off this Tabernacle amen when I take off this everybody oh it's not valuable it's only going to last three SC years and 10 amen this this life here is not long compared to eternal life which has no beginning and no end are you with me praise God not only the the benefits of having eternal life amen I'll tell you amen I got some Riders on this policy praise God that you can worry you don't have to worry about you and your children and your children praise God they can ride praise God God on your policy praise God he said amen amen if you accept the Lord Jesus Christ he said it's for you and for your children and to them that are fall even as many as the Lord Our God your call amen come on and ride on my policy praise God I'm not only going to save you but I'll save your house amen I know God will do it praise God I'm doing it amen praise God I you know sometimes amen Jesus when he died amen praise God he left us benefits he left us in inheritance God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him shall not perish but have ever eternal life I want eternal life amen what can I do to get it you can't work for it amen money can't buy it Hallelujah you can't live good enough because all my righteousness filthy rags amen what can I do to get it I said Jesus already paid for your Assurance your life Assurance uh Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foraste of Glory Divine Jesus already paid the price Hallelujah by what I got to do all you got to do is receive what he does Amen the blood has already been shed it Jesus has already died amen he giv you an inheritance let me read this in closing St John 10 and 24 St John 10 and 24 I'm glad to be in the number one more time there so much going on out there in the world this world is shaking as never before have we seen so much shaking the devil is fighting they're trying to keep you in bondage but thanks be to God that gives us the victory to our Lord Jesus Christ thank God this morning that we can have Victory I said eternal life praise God you couldn't you can't pay for it you can't work for it you never live good enough to get it but let's look at St John 10 and 24 then then came the Jews around about him and said unto him how long do thou make us to what to doubt if thou be the Christ tell tell us what and Jesus answered them I have told you right and you what and you believe not the works that I do in my father name they what they bear witness of me but ye believe not do you believe that eternal life is yours that you can have it you can receive it or will you leave here believing not he said but ye believe not because ye are what you're not my sheep the only way you're not going to believe is because you're not his sheep are you with me don't make no mistake God does not make a mistake amen he said they didn't believe because they were not his sheep okay as I said unto you my what my sheep what you know it it gives me consolation to you know you you you want people to do right and live right and to
