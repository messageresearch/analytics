god manna from on high thank you Lord Father for we love you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen we want to look at the book tonight Romans by God's grace Romans five and we'll begin at the first verse god is good there's a little something you know that the Lord has been putting into my heart and you know I just mean I guess everybody I've been talking to here lately I've been sharing a little bit of it with them you know that so I just pray that it'll be a blessing you know something just to give you faith for the time that we live amen seeing that we live in a treacherous time a time like Noah no other time you never would expected something like this you know that I was talking us so Jackson days says you know put the whole world on standby but sometimes God got to do that they got to put the whole world and stop stopping mode just to do what to get your attention now there's many that God even though he did that they still ain't gonna take the heat of God they gonna take all this precious time that God has given us like it says the Bible says we got to redeem the time for the days are evil well I believe God has given us time right now to redeem time that we can get along with God and and and you know I believe that he said in the scriptures come let us reason together saith the Lord come on God sometimes got to call us call us to a conference into a place where he wants to reason with us and top things over see what the present stage of your your ministry is precious days your life presence days your condition just where are we come sometimes God got to do that and to do that sometimes God we know hit what he did he had it takes sometimes people to the backside of the mountain to do that you know to get him away from all the other noise and all the other commotion of the land like I think about Moses he had to get him on the backside back there you know herding sheep and stuff just so he can get him alone to a place to where he can speak to him he can call him and say come on up come on I got something I want to talk to you about you know and that's what it is God does that finds finds ways I believe that to get us alone think about Paul he put him on the backside of the over in Arabia think about John the Baptist sent him out in the wilderness you know what it is God sending you and those sometimes those places the way he can have that one-on-one Communion and fellowship with you because he's got something he want to talk to you about I believe he told Abraham I'm gonna have I won't have from my server the things that I want to do and if we can sit down sometimes and and just meditate on the Lord you know sometimes God he want to show you some things he get into that place to where we seeking God we praying we are looking to him and then he can tell us sometimes or the things that's lying up ahead you know I believe that Paul said that these things they're gonna take you under where I say they're gonna take the world on the wherever certain things wouldn't gonna take us under where why because we've been in Christ and we know what's next we know what's coming next we might can't see it sometimes physically or no exactly but we know that right now is the time that we should be getting our house in order amen Romans 5 and by God's grace we're gonna start hitting the first verse and I read therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ God wants to give you peace tonight he says by whom also we have access by faith into the grace wherein we stand and and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if we if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ well whom we have now received the atonement may God had a blessed his reading of his word tonight by God's grace I just want a minister teeth for a moment and I entitled it the trials that we face amen the trials that we face and I said sometimes God what he does he he wants to get us to a place to where he can just commune with us and then he can bring us up up to speed you know God don't ever want to leave his people just out there lost without nothing I believe you know said that God don't never leave itself without a witness you know in the people they could be completely in sin and God can bring judgment on them but when they cry out to God God is still come down and and a lot of times he'll come down and still show them where they are and give them opportunity to be reconciled back to him and that's what we thank God for is that reconciliation that grace you know we always say that only difference between the the judgment scene in the mercy-seat is is blood when the blood is sprinkled on the judgment seat then it becomes mercy but when the blood is taken away from the judgment seat then that same seat that were the ones gave you mercy the blood is taken away and now it's gonna bring new judgment but we know that you know like I said while mercy is still available we want to obtain God's mercies but we're talking about you know it says the trials that you face you know it doesn't matter what condition or where you come from in life or how old you are how young you are you know while we here in this body we're gonna have trials and tribulations we're gonna have things in this life we're gonna have disappointments we're gonna have ups and downs we're gonna have times the way we just want to throw up our hands we're gonna have times the way you're gonna lay down and you're gonna want to die you gonna have times the way you're gonna ask yourself the question what is it all for you're gonna have times the way you just want to give up on life you want to give up on church you don't want to walk away but I said that it's something about it if you were just holding on to God just a little while longer then you would see that in all the trials and all the things that you've been through it wasn't nothing to be compared to the glory that God was gonna reveal in you or the things that God had in store for you I believe that that even the Bible says that weeping may endure for a night but joy is coming in the morning it seems hard sometime in that night but when the joy comes in the morning that sorrow sometimes don't even seem like it was even nothing you look back at those things and you you might laugh sometimes but when you were in that condition or in that stage it wasn't about laughing it might have been hurt it might have been pain but when you indoors when you made it through it and then you look back and you see just how good god is when you realize that God keeps all his promises then he took all of my enemies and he drowned them in the sea I could think about Israel and when they were in Egypt and how when they were in bondage it was hard it was wrong the Bible says that they cried out because of the reason of bondage and they taskmasters but we nee and when they made it on the other side of the Red Sea they cried again but it was a different crime it was a cry appraises it was a cry I believe the Bible says that Moses sang a new song I believe that the Bible says that Miriam took the tambourine and the women went behind her and they were praising and shouting God but now just a few days ago and they didn't have that shout they didn't have that dance but God came through for him and I think that I said that's what happens if we can only endure what we're going through right now we can only endure that what the world has been hid the world has been struck in the world is shaking in fear but I want to say tonight that the Bible says fear not little flock but it's the father's pleasure to give you the kingdom when the world is fear and I don't want you to fear but I want you to have faith and that's what it is I like how here you know Paul we bleed right out of the book he spins he was saying you know he was saying that therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ I don't know about you but being justified through faith we got peace tonight you know peace is something hard to come about come around the day because why everybody's got something they worried about worried about the job worried about their or their family worried about their health worried about the peas and the robbers breaking through the steel but I want to say to you tonight if you got faith in Jesus then you got peace peace they say like a river peace days that not that I give you a que no man give you and no man can't take it away I want to say you know we're looking at the trials that we face but I like how it says in the second verse by whom you talking about Jesus Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace to where we stand you know I was praying the other day and I said you know it I said Lord I said we don't always understand what's taking place you know your Christian journey is built on faith the foundation is gonna be faith you stepped out on faith and whatever you had you walked away from it you believed from the beginning that God was gonna keep you that God was gonna do what he said he was gonna do and if you have faith to step out then building it is guard that's saying god I want to say it has guard change has he lost his power or is he still that same God when you step out on faith from the beginning and God kept you hallelujah when you couldn't see your way before you and you stepped out God building the road as you're going down I believe that with all of my heart stepping out in air but God building the pathway he didn't let's just sit but you stepped out anyway and just as God is did that now he's saying I'm still that same God if you would display that same faith god I don't know where we gone I don't know where this is taking us to but I know one thing that God you promise that you'll never leave us nor forsake us you never left me then you ain't gonna leave me now God just still here and I'm stepping out on faith I'm still walking hallelujah I believe that but we find that what we says I believe I like that how Paul says we got access by faith into this grace that we stand we stand in the night by grace we kept by grace you know I was thinking I said that we don't you know we don't always understand what's taking place you know or why God allow things to happen no I'm minister one time on what God allows sometimes God say God want to let that law help them to his children God allow certain things to happen and we don't understand why God allowed to happen and God don't have to explain himself but God has got a purpose and all that he does you know I think about I think about the scriptures and it says that you know how perfect God is and we're going to say who can he be compared to God can't be compared to nobody he exceeds everyone even the one you think over is great it is a great statue guard exceeds him just leaving that more God one that you think God that's good God exceeds him even higher than that one that you think there's rich God exceeds him even in rich God it's easy he is uncompelled you can't compare God to nobody God you know he's the greatest there ever was I believe that they sang a song he's the highest he's hired and highest and he's greater than the greatest come on he's the King of Kings that he's the Lord of lords he's the undisputed the heavyweight champion I know I got it all mixed up but he's granted in the song he's greater than we can describe him God is greater than s hallelujah that's the God that we serve and nobody can take away from him nobody can add to him nobody can take away from him you know the devil is confused Sharyl somebody today I said you know what when we win this thing shall pass and we can all be able to come back together again and worship the Lord I said we ought to be stronger than we ever been why because now is the time you ought to be building up such a communion in a relationship with God I said the devil gonna be confused why because he look away he took away to the church they look like the people should have got weak but they came out stronger why because they got a revelation that no matter where they were they still was able to praise God no matter where they were God was still able to be reached hallelujah God could still be touched they didn't have to be in a building made by hands but there was somewhere and they could always reach God I believe that how many believed is come on I want to invite you I said I don't know about you but recently I've been praying like I ain't never prayed before I've been commuting and seeking and talking to God like I never had I said with all this time on your hands what you gonna do now come on you're just gonna waste the time are you gonna redeem it I said I'm gonna redeem the time imma start catching up on all that missed prayer time all that missing time that didn't have why I said I don't know about you but I'm getting stronger you know when the devil told Pauling's I mean I the devil but they told Paul and Silas in prison setting them being their whining and complaining word about how they gonna get out of it I believe the Bible said they started singing and praising God they started clapping and having Church in the jailhouse in so much that an angel came down hallelujah shook the place and I believe God is still dispatching angels right now if your prayers can get right if you can praise God right he still can send down angels today to do what shake the place hallelujah shake your body out of that pain you're going through shake your mind how did that trouble you're going through I believe God is still that same God that's what it is we call him God on the scene you know I like how like how I believe was Gideon he said if God be God we're all this miracle said we want a guard miracles we want to go out of power if God be God where's all his miracles and I believe that God still got miracles I would say we don't say a bag of miracles cuz he ain't like a magician with a bag of tricks god no it ain't that the bag like that that's just who he is amen but we find that we says you know or the trials that we face you know I said Lord you know spraying the other day I said I'm not asking you why but I'm asking you for the Grace and for the patience you'll make it through it because I said oh no I said God when it's all over we don't we'll cry when it's all over beginning to praying we don't shout the victory we gonna dance we're gonna sing we gonna pray as we're doing it now but when it's all over come on it ain't nothing like traveling over the enemy's feet ahead I mean it ain't nothing like when your enemies is drowned cast into the sea what it is we got to realize I said God ain't asking you why I said cuz I don't understand I don't see the role before you for me I'm just asking you for the grace and for the patients come on don't make it through it and I believe that that you know sometimes you know I says that you know got our approach to God I said so many times it means a lot it means a whole lot I approach to God you know I think about Solomon and God asked him once before what did he want you know he could ask for the money he could ask for this and that but he said lord I want wisdom and history just like his approach his heart was right and God said since you could ask me anything and I too gave it to you but since that's what you asked for not only I'm gonna give you that but I'm gonna give you everything else to go along with it and I said God that's what it is we're not asking God to take us out of the trial we're not asking God did not let us go through now come on but we're asking God for the grace in the patience that makes it through it and I believe that if we ask God in the right way God would give us what it takes then Durer I would share with somebody I says the race is not given to the strength not as strong but it's given to those that ache endure come on the ones that can last God wants some God most people that are last Saturday they battle-tested they they they they come on it's something about those battle-tested veterans the ones that straight out of boot camp and they get out on the battlefield ain't been battle tested when the bullets beginning to fly in their running they hide they don't know they shell-shocked come on I think about it shared like this it was a wound on soldier he was saying how this is our general another general butter officer in World War two and and how he just came out of school and they put him in them in the battlefield and they were going in the heat of the battle and he say he he began to tell the soldiers when the bullets beginning to fly in it if you start running the first one that runs I'm a shooter in these in these guys that he was talking to her privates but they don't been through some battles they had been into some Wars and some storms they don't been through some trials now and they know what the battle was like so when they got on the battlefield they said the first thing they'll hit from a mortar round and killed a radio man killed his first sergeant all right before his eyes and he said he got so shell-shocked that he couldn't move they had to take him by his hands and lead him off the battlefield why because he was never battle tested school couldn't prepare him for reality school could prepare him for when the bombs begin to fall and that's what it is right now we need some battle tested Christians we some Christians that not only read and they know it intellectually but they've been through the storm they been through the rain hallelujah and when times come like this they know what they know what to do when the devil beginning is dropping bombs and throwing all kind of fiery darts you ain't have to lead them out the battlefield but they don't stand there gallows they gonna put up the shield of faith they gonna realize who-who been keeping them in all those battles before and they're gonna let nothing stop them what they going through now come on God is getting you battle ready don't you know the battle is coming this ain't nothing compared to I was sharing somebody I was saying that they was talking about you know Jesus said that well when these things happen he says that you know the sign the wars and the rumors of war think it was Matthew 24 and he was saying when Sir that they asked him a question when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of that coming in the Sinai and asked him questions and he began to tell him he began to say oh you'll see this happened you'll see that happen he said to be pestilence earthquakes from diverse places you know I think about you know all those things like that we did I have this he said he said but all of these are just the beginning of Sorrows come on I say you think you've been through something I said something you said all of these are just the beginning of it come on so if this is just the beginning and we can't even make it through just a little what we're going through now how you gonna be understanding what's coming up the road come on but we know that before the battle get too hot and before we get to our breaking point I believe God to come back and get us how many believe that but we find that we talk about you know the trials that we faced I says that you know I ask God for the grace and the patience that you know I said no matter you know what we face God has a plan come on God has a plan in it no matter what we face no matter how negative it look God got a plan in it no matter how bad it'll God got a plan in God got something he's working out you you don't understand it and we can go through the scriptures but for the sake of time I'm just gonna have to skip over a lot because I had a lot of things I wanted to go but we could critique them but I just want to just get the gist a sermon come on I says that you know it might look bad I says but what we do no matter what we face we got to change our thinking God got a plan in it come on I wasn't one of the one characters I wanted to look at it was Joel and I said is that some people say God would let his children go through that but but what did God let Joe go through come on you know the Bible says Joe job we know he was a righteous man he was one that feared God he was one that tried to live the best that he could have I believe the best I know how the way in so much that God even has Satan and Satan said he going to and fro the earth seeking I mean saying God began to tell them he says have you tried my survey Joe come on they ain't none more righteous and him than all the earth come on you say why would God put his own child in a place like that God wouldn't do us like that come on now he did job like that didn't he and he didn't even tell job that's what he was doing come on but that's what he did and I said that's what happens a lot of times we look at it Oh God it's not that are you going through it just because you're saying all that but it could be because God trying to get some glory out of it come on now we know that you know we still check our lives daily and we still you know make sure that we're right with God but even anybody but in all the things that we go through we got to change the way we looking at like we say that situation you know I think about it I says you know a job he didn't question the God God the Bible says that in all those things they lost all the trouble that he had go through you could go you can just read just read the book of Job you get a chance all the things that he had to suffer and then when it looked like that should have been enough it still was piling up on them it still was hitting them hard look like when that should have been enough then it still was hitting them hard but what it was Joel maintained this integrity no matter what he stayed God I believe because Joel mine was conditioning that he wasn't looking at these things in the way that we look at him a lot of times but Joel you know one of the things he said he said the Lord give and he take away blessed be the name of the Lord don't you know everything you got it's only because God blessed you with it the things that we can obtain and achieve I was praying the other day I said Lord with just a one wave of your hand not even that with just one gesture you can wipe out all that I am I said God with just one gesture I said I'm only living the way I can live I'm only blessed the way I'm blessed is because of all that you're doing for me not only did you come and die I said Lord you don't do nothing else that was enough but you did more than you decay man die I said God will each and every day he's still blessing me you still giving me undeserved blessings and I said guard I looked at like that I said Lord I'm so glad that you're lovely I said because god I realized that just the one wave with your hand I can be nothing I could lose my mind I don't even you you can take the breath of life right there just as a gesture just cut you off I said but God you've given me one more day I said God you blessed us to be family one more night Lord I said God you open so many doors you made so many ways I might I couldn't see what you've been doing and I said Lord I'm not even even worried about that in that way I one thing I'm gonna do is just praise God you don't have to prove to me Lord God how much you love me I know you love me because when I was resting and undone when I was unfit not worthy to even be called a child of God you still call me by your name hallelujah how many glad God called him by his name I thank the Lord for that I said you know Joey we didn't question my says you know but what happened I said God God used Joe to prove to Satan that he had a man that would trust him no matter what come on God wanted to prove to Satan Satan didn't believe him did he you know he only worship for you because of this he said come on I got a man that no matter what he don't serve me and I know it because God knew what was in JoVE heart I said it was proven time for job and hos are saved even tonight it ain't proven time for you God want to see whether you gonna stay with him or not God want to see whether you gonna hold on to the world whether you going door to tonight whether you battle-tested as you say you are come on or whether we gonna have to lead you off the battlefield come on I pray that we don't have to leave the battlefield but I pray we can join hands and pray huh come on and build up such a wall that the devil can't get through there how many believe that oh we thank the Lord I said the trials that we faced I said just as it was a proven time then you know you know we look at certain things that we face and I said God you know whose estate is an approving time now because what God does dard God is he's the master builder come on the orders of builder you know he he was trained in carpentry come on God is a master builder come on so when he's working on us he know what he doing it might not look like nothing coming out of it you know you know I believe a true a carpenter or a sculpture of something or real artists they can look at something don't mean nothing but what they see in what other people that ain't got that gift they can't see what they see they see potential in it but everybody else that don't even gift it like that they don't see that potential but that artist he can look at it on our sculpture or that master builder he said oh we could work with that come on Oh glory to God but everybody else came I said you know God is the master builder he's the master artist he's the master painter or whatever you want to call him he definitely he's the master in it come on that when nobody they say it's fun it's unsalvageable come on God say no it ain't unsalvageable I'd know how to rock a restore it I got faith that I believe that when I'm done with it it'll be all right it'll be a place where I can go and live in hallelujah how many believe that but the walls are falling down the foundation ain't right god said but when I get doing with it come on I'll be able to go and live in it how many how many want God did the work on them guarding on going no house that's that the roof falling me and come on that might fall down on him but a foundation gonna give away on the mother war the storm I believe it I believe it says that when the window when the storms calm it's going try you can say what you got your house built on but when it storms the trials come it's gonna try it every man work the Bible say gonna be proved we gonna see what the house made out of then come on but I said god I what you too bill don't be long Lord work homes and that's what it is God let us say he's the master builder come on he's building things huh he's working on us bringing us true you know faith and in knowledge you know brotherly kind of you know we go about the pyramid I just you know go that way but I said you know God is building on us come on because he wants to bring the head to the body come on capstone the love because he can't just rest anywhere so God is building us come on he's the master builder he's doing something in us come on that's way it says he we know that the trials of our faith come on it's working patience come on God is building something on your God is working on you God is building you up to just something because he's the master builder but I says that once we understand that what God is doing then we're not sitting in stalemate come on but we moving when everybody else ain't moving you know we're still moving on in God come on I believe that we say the theme for this year was gonna be let's go home and they say you know they've shut the church down come on but I said you know what we still going on and that shouldn't stop your progress you know we ain't gonna stop moving because we can't assemble together but we gonna run with a heart we're still moving come on why because we're still united in the spirit come on we still in heavenly places in Christ Jesus we still in tune with one another why because all those that are in Christ are like-minded and God it goes hard from you what he intending to do God is still pouring out fresh revelation down in your soul hallelujah when everybody else is starving when they you're wrong rather than scraps God's got something held in reserve just for this moment hallelujah and I believe that I say God I want what you got in reserve Lord God I won't it Lord oh I don't have to be out there gathering scraps my father I don't have to eat out of that come on he says my father's got more than enough I'm going back to my father's house I don't know about you but I'm going back they were saying your father I'm going back to the throne how down in prayer down on my knees hallelujah and I believe God go something deep down on the inside come on I believe that with all of my heart God is inviting us come on in I believe God is is inviting us right now come on come on to that place where I can commune which you know I won't have a relationship which I was sharing with someone the other day I said you know the thing about it is I says love is a funny thing I say I said sometimes I say I mean wife joking around we said you know we fell in love with each other but we didn't really know what love was it was love but I said love got a different meaning now did it did it come on I said especially when children came and then trials hit and I said is that the more we go we go through and the more that we face and make it out of it that's the more we love one another that's the more of a relationship in a barn we got why because we don't being through some things together we don't have the whole each other up in the midnight hour several times I said and the longer we stay together there was a time I said that you know you just you just thought you couldn't live without her but then it comes on placing the relationship that you realize I can't live without her come on why because she's a part of me it's not just that it was a lust thing but I realized this she was a part of me come on and so I said if I would go a day without talking to her I feel I'd feel something wrong I'd feel like some part of me was missing especially if I was go to three days a week without talking to my wife I said that it would be like a Hilton is something missing and I said just as I have that relationship with my wife in that way I says that I that you have that you should have that relationship with God that same way come on that the longer you saved and you stay with God come on I said is that you build in such a relationship with him we say he done busted through this come on he done bought you through that come on and now you know it was a point it was a time you know that God he said he'd rather die for you come on and now you cut me cutting beginning to love him in such a way that you won't you've got the little for him come on and I say is that you know to go with our days without talking to God something about to be missing you ought to feel that something is missing I believe that when we don't have that fellowship in that communion with God God he needs that fellowship in that communion with you why because you are part of him you you you are ill I would say you are completing him he came and died for you that we can be as be his wife come on the make up who he is and I says that that's what it is that's the kind of love and the relationship and I'm gonna have to close the night and we ain't even got started on the tribulation come on and the things that you go through but I says that you know I want you to just be encouraged I says you know the Bible says that you know that tribulation it worketh patience and pacing experience come on God it's building you building you taking you to come on it's working I like how it says the first thing tribulation work is patience that's the first thing God working outpaces come on in you that you can learn how do we don't know you can learn I believe that how to how to trust God in all in all circumstances God is working that out come on because you know I believe the Bible says let patience have it's perfect work that you might be perfect you know you say you want to be perfect well patience is gonna protect you you know to a person that day can wait on God that has the patience to wait on God and ain't in no rush because they know that God keeps all his promises and no matter what they gonna they gonna do whatever God asked them and they gonna be faithful to God that person is a perfect person why because nothing changed shake them I believe Joel said though he slay me yet I'm still trust all all these things the skin worms all these things eating my fleece said no the skin worms eat my flesh dog got balls he says he was still convinced they said I know my Redeemer liveth and I got patience no way don't know come on but what it does tribulation working patience pacing experience come on it's bringing you through an experience hope come on we find that what is are doing bringing us I believe that from from phase to phase I was saying I says that's what God does he puts us into a place God always does that now close here he puts dust God always puts us in situations the way we we have no other choice but to have faith in Him well we have no other choice but to draw from him I think about you know since I used to sing a song there's a cool well of water springing up in me come on Jesus is that water I think about Jesus how he met the woman that in the will and and he began to talk to her about her coming to draw come on he says you you coming here to the well to draw and but he says but you know I got water come on he had something that he wanted you draw from him come on he talked about that water that when somebody draw that water and once they get a drink or net he said you're never thirst again come on in so in a way that he is saying come on that everlasting fountain and that's what people they they never some times we as individuals never get that personal relationship we never get that that personal experience they're going in I believe to the baptism of the Holy Ghost they understand come once you come to that place and you learn then because when the teacher comes he says he gonna teach you all things when he comes in and then you learn why he's teaching you that I want I want you to I can explain it like this you know I was thinking about the the little girl Helen Helen Keller she was born deaf and dumb and all and I said dad you know it was only one person that could teach her and I think now her name is Anne Sullivan but she could she could take her and teach her how to function in a world that she didn't have no knowledge of that she couldn't see that she couldn't hear but Anne Sullivan could had what had a gift to teach her how to function in that world and I said what it is when you're born again come on you've been translated out of this world into the kingdom of God to where you no longer live by your five sisters but you live by faith in that world you you in a world of faith you can't see it you can feel it you have even no knowledge or means scientific places they even place it there come on but faith tells you it's there now how you gonna operate in that world without the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has to be your teacher it takes you by the hands hallelujah and it might not be an overnight thing but he takes just about of him and he begins to show us how to operate in that world to way we come to that place to a it's just like second nature you don't you can't explain how you can't explain how you just no you just get up and just walk like that but it was just second nature then it becomes second nature to you even in the fit in the face room Ted knap took that no matter when situations arise you immediately reach out into the hand of faith why because the Holy Ghost has taught you how to how to adapt into the world you live in in that in that world the Holy Ghost has has translated he brought you to that place to where you know you're not governed by these things but you already tapped into that another dimension it's HAP inter that place to where God is that's why nothing can faze you living in another world and I believe that I said God is that what you're doing even to us right now ulong's that happened that the medical field you know we thank God for the doctors and the nurses but we say a lot of times they've been exposed why because things hit they have known they panic and they don't know what to do come on they don't know which way to turn they trying to spare China and hoping that the things might work and we thank God even for all of their efforts but it's something about it what does God do sometimes puts us in the corner the way we can have no other choice but to say God you know you've exhausted everything else oh come on God he is the S he is the one he go he said come on I want to show you how to operate I want to show you how to enter into those things that the world know nothing about I want to show you things in the world that man can't see only the Holy Ghost will be able to bring out of your spirit about Revelation that you can look in word and see where you are the time that you're living in you might look at your brother or your sister next to you say brother sister can't you see it but they can't see why because they hadn't gone through that teaching that training that Holy Ghost took you through but God takes us through that how many thankful for that tonight a man is mr. Simmons comes we thank the Lord for you tonight God is so good amen I said you know I was thinking about a song it says you know I thank God for the valleys and I thank God for the mountains and all the trials that I've been through cuz if I never had a problem I wouldn't know that God could solve I never know what faith in God [Music] pray thank the Lord he been appreciated amen the trials that we go through amen we thank God for our nation and simply get we thank God for tonight the trials that we go through my mom used to sing a song you talked about the one they've been through trials and tribulations and she would sing here's one with 15 children I guess she went through some trials and some tribulation he is one so we thank God tonight that he met the trials that we go through I got up about three o'clock this morning and I was just praying and writing and listening to a precious brother Ernie shed it says that here tonight he's talking about therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ I've been listening to the president as he talked about virus and all and one thing I noticed lately that everybody seems to start talking about God he's talking about Easter I hadn't heard the president curse' lately [Music] thank the changing right changing for the better talking about God amen I thank the Lord Amen God can touchy he knows how to Humble us now that we can't get too high that God came humbled us down amen everybody recognize that we need help [Music] that somebody that's higher than you and I as we go through this trial the world it's going through as our minister they get saying the world is going to their tests and their trial and as a world go through the stress and trial and as we go through testers and trials he meant it takes God that bring us out victoriously somebody told me about a song and it must have came in my spirit some kind of way and all I thought about this morning as I was writing the the man in the mirror and I thought about what James was saying concerning the man in the mirror he said in James Warren he said were four lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your soul but eat but be doers of the word and not hearers only he says here deceiving your own self how can a man deceive his own [Music] I believe we have so many people that are hears of the word and not doers of the word and because they hear the word they shout that dance and they clap their hands and they say man but when it comes down to doing they don't do it those folks that do that kind of thing they deceive their own self they're not deceiving the preacher they're not receiving God but they deceiving their own self so don't you get a word about the hypocrites they deceive in their own self he says here for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass I said the man in the mirror he sees himself in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was he forgot what manner of man he was and then he says here but whoso looketh into the perfect law of Liberty praise God the perfect law of Liberty I heard mr. Leggett talk about faith amen the perfect law of Liberty and continues day in he is not you've got to continue in that perfect law of Liberty the Bible tells us the man is not justified by the law in the sight of God but by faith are you up there and when you look into the perfect law of Liberty and when you're looking at them in the mirror they meant and you're looking in the mirror I wonder who or what do you see when you look in the mirror I think that many people they men they're looking with their their natural eyes but they have no spiritual sight to understand that God they meant when you're looking at mirror you are not to see yourself you are to look in the mirror and see a reflection of him that liveth in you and that ought to be Jesus Christ you said I want to see Jesus t-this when I look in the mirror I want to see Jesus now we don't want to just look we want to see the word we want to see the word manifested in our lives we want to see Jesus Christ living in me when you look in the mirror don't look at yourself I believe many folks look in the mirror and it faces me this morning I tell these special little boys sometimes my son said this is my daughter where you're going get you're all dressed up and he's still in his pajamas and I said you ought to get out and get your teats and put them in comb your head and you know look like you're going somewhere you don't get up and go stand in your pajamas all day the tips of some of the old-timers I want to say amen go dig in the backyard and bring some something the guards are fly balls or something get up take off those clothes you might be here for a little while but don't get lazy or you'll do something moving around but some fool kid look in the mirror they said I ain't going to where I got a stay home so they get lazy and lead back but get ready not your head if you can't walk never walk around the house on outside do something move some folk ain't doing nothing you'll get depress and wear it down they don't get don't let the pressure set in and start doing some crazy stuff they may die you know the old-timers said I idle mind is the devil's workshop yeah so let's not be idle let's get it and do something let's get on our knees and mentally get said start crying out to God God I need you I need the spirit I need your power I need you my life God God I want to get closer to you Amen I want to go the man in the mirror amen what what do you see when you look at in the mirror in the mirror that we're talking about is the Word of God they meant and you look into the Word of God then the word that's in you in the word that you're looking at muscle they meant that sin you should reflect what's in the Bible Jesus was a word and he said such the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they they testify of me he understood what the word said he would do and then he said now I want you to know I'm doing what the word testified on me to do he meant and you got to find what he said the church would do and what he said the bride would do and you got to see amen what God says in the word and look at it Amen if you look at the church and you look at the bride and you look at you you ought to see the power of God greater is He that's in you you ought to see the works that I do shall you would do also are you up and if you're not doing the work then you need to get down to praying and get down to seeking God until God is manifesting in you the man in the mirror we are so busy trying to make the outside look nice and as the Pharisees did they they thought about the outside and they loved you know the long robes and all of that stuff and in Oakland and a mint they were full of dead men bones they meant they wasn't right in the inside but the outside looked good amen and some things that I could talk about but I thank God for the word tonight I just wanted to share a little bit just a little bit of what I was going through three o'clock this morning but by the grace of God we've heard the night the trials we go through amen don't want you to forget that the guard is to be with us through all of our trials amen not only will he be with us but he'll be in us to all of our trials they meant God will make a way for you you and I he meant we've saw in time plans what God did for others and he'll do the same for us you got to put your faith in God and trust him one thing he said who also he said a stain from the parents of evil amen he said I pray God that your whole spirit soul and body amen brief reserved blameless amen God wants you to be preserved now that's first Thessalonians 5 who also will do it he will do it God will preserve not only see because we worry about the body too much but God is worried about the inside but here you preserve your blameless not only will you do your body but your soul and your spirit it's a here preserved you're blameless he'll do it he's not saying that you were doing he said he meant he will do it amen he said I pray God that your whole body I mean your whole spirit soul and body be preserved amen and I thank God God wants to preserve us they meant blameless they meant God want to preserve not part of you but the whole of you your spirit your soul and your body God wants to preserve all of you so you look in the glass and what do you see all of you if you just looking at the outside God is looking at the whole of you he's looking at your spirit he's looking at your soul he's looking at your body God see the whole of you and God will choose to look and God that sees the inside he sees the heart and what the heart is all about so when you look into the perfect law of Liberty when you look into the mirror he meant you got to recognize that there God that had got eyes in it that you can't hide for he sees everything you do he meant he knows he meant your thoughts he knows what your heart is feeling he knows what are you a man faithful to him or not in it but he said I want you to be faithful and if you be faithful then i preserved blameless he meant if you continue in the faith rooted in ground God wants you to continue on amen it's time they may to fight this good fight god is good amen don't just read the Bible don't just talk about the Bible but live the Bible amen praise God we got so many people want to be lifted up all the time he meant but they don't want to live Jesus up in their lives he said if I'll be lifted up he meant you got to lift Jesus up you got to let Jesus be lifted up in your life when folks see you they ought to see Jesus and you got to look at yourself and be honest with yourself the man in the mirror you ought not to say that I'm pleased with that man you got to examine yourself and see whether you be in the faith or not
