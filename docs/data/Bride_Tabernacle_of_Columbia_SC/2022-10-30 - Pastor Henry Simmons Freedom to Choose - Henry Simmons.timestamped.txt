[31:17] well this
[31:18] commandment which I've commanded thee
[31:22] this day
[31:24] it is not hidden from thee neither is it
[31:29] for all 12.
[31:41] neither is it Beyond the Sea
[31:45] that thou should it say who shall go
[31:49] over the sea for us
[31:52] and bring it unto us
[31:55] that we may hear it and do it 14.
[32:07] see I have set before thee this day life
[32:13] and good
[32:15] and death
[32:17] and Evil 16.
[32:40] but if by and hard turn away
[32:44] and so that thou will not hear but shall
[32:50] be drawn away and worship of the Gods
[32:54] and serve them 18.
[33:09] together
[33:11] I call Heaven and Earth to record this
[33:14] day against you that I have set before
[33:17] the life and death blessing and cursing
[33:21] therefore choose life that thou May born
[33:25] see build
[33:27] God bless everybody
[33:30] praise God Amen
[33:34] he said I set before your life and death
[33:37] in other words we have a
[33:39] a the freedom of choice we can choose
[33:43] to live or choose to to die
[33:47] but it's all
[33:49] we were teaching the little
[33:52] Sunday school class A little I said
[33:54] Sunday school but we have it on Tuesday
[33:56] they look classy
[33:58] God said I set before your life and
[34:00] death in the beginning
[34:03] we understand that God put the tree of
[34:05] knowledge and good and evil there
[34:07] and uh he said every tree of the garden
[34:09] you may freely eat but of the tree of
[34:11] knowledge and good and even the day you
[34:13] touch it the day you eat of it you're
[34:14] gonna die
[34:15] amen but it was their own Freedom of
[34:18] Choice you give us free will
[34:21] it gave us the free will to choose
[34:24] Lie To Live or to die
[34:28] and
[34:29] Adam and Eve made the wrong choice
[34:33] so God gives us back to the same Choice
[34:36] he gave out of need we can choose to
[34:38] live or we can choose to die he gives us
[34:41] the freedom of choice
[34:43] you know they have what we call the the
[34:45] freedom uh abortion rights or whatever
[34:49] and you know they can choose to abort
[34:52] they can choose not to abort and then
[34:55] this is you know all of that going on in
[34:57] the political Romania about
[35:00] um abortion rights freedom of choice and
[35:03] um but we have to choose we have free
[35:06] will
[35:07] and that's what I want to deal with you
[35:10] have a free will you you you can choose
[35:13] to serve God uh choose not to serve God
[35:16] is God gives us that freedom
[35:20] so with that freedom I want to go to
[35:24] Acts 9.
[35:27] Acts 9.
[35:29] in free will
[35:31] you know in one place God said you have
[35:34] not chosen me but I've chosen you
[35:37] are you with me
[35:39] I'm glad God made a choice to choose me
[35:42] amen
[35:43] and he could have choose chose somebody
[35:45] else but he chose me amen
[35:49] and there that God chose me he's
[35:52] that means that God foreknew me
[35:57] and God foreknew you
[35:59] and I believe if you're God's choice
[36:02] then he said my sheep know my voice said
[36:04] they hear my voice
[36:06] amen so you understand it
[36:10] amen God has called you for a special
[36:12] reason for a special purpose
[36:16] and this morning amen
[36:18] you have freedom a choice you have the
[36:22] freedom Amen to accept what the word
[36:25] says or to reject it that's your
[36:27] prerogative
[36:29] you can do it
[36:31] or you can say well I choose to
[36:34] you know
[36:35] to do what I want to do
[36:39] as we say God so loved the world that he
[36:41] gave his only begotten son whosoever
[36:42] believe in him should not perish but
[36:44] have everlasting life
[36:46] we can choose whether we want it or we
[36:48] don't want it
[36:49] to believe it or not to believe it
[36:52] amen
[36:54] it's because we don't believe it amen we
[36:56] can't receive it
[36:58] but if we believe what God says about it
[37:01] then amen God said I'm going to bless
[37:03] you
[37:04] in other words if we choose the other
[37:06] route
[37:07] it comes with you said good
[37:10] choose life choose good
[37:13] choose evil and you choose it down
[37:17] are you with me
[37:19] so it's your choice if we die it's not
[37:22] God's fault
[37:23] if we Allah you know a lot of things in
[37:27] life we go through is because of the
[37:29] choices we make
[37:31] the choices we make Amen to not to do
[37:35] what God says and and the choices we
[37:37] make to do what we want to do
[37:40] are you with me
[37:42] Jesus said not my will amen but let thy
[37:46] will be done
[37:47] so when we're talking about free will we
[37:49] talk about sometimes the will of God
[37:52] uh you know our will
[37:55] are we talking about perfect will
[37:57] permissive will amen we're talking about
[38:00] you have a choice it's your will
[38:03] permissive will Free Will of you know
[38:06] the will of God but Jesus said not my
[38:10] will you know and a lot of times the
[38:13] trouble we get in in life is because
[38:16] it's we do our own will sometimes we go
[38:20] through life and sometimes folks go
[38:22] through life a long time
[38:24] and then never find the will of God for
[38:26] their life
[38:27] they never find it they just always
[38:29] searching for God why am I here what is
[38:32] your plan what is the what what is God
[38:35] saying to me I I want the will of God to
[38:38] be done in my life how many of you want
[38:39] the will of God to be done in your life
[38:41] I want the will of God to be done in my
[38:43] life God I know I
[38:48] have my choice is amen Lord I want to
[38:51] please you I want your way to be done
[38:53] I want God's will to be done in my life
[38:56] that's what I want that's what I desire
[38:59] but I just don't want the permissive
[39:02] will I want God's perfect will
[39:04] for me amen I want I I want what God
[39:08] wants for me amen it may not be what my
[39:11] flesh want but it's what God wants I'm
[39:14] willing to accept God's purpose
[39:17] amen
[39:19] uh sister Keisha was singing on Friday
[39:22] you know take up your cross and follow
[39:24] him you know what I'm saying and that's
[39:27] what I I I I I I I I I thought about
[39:29] that you know when I was prepared take
[39:32] up your cross and follow him amen don't
[39:35] be ashamed Amen to say that you know him
[39:39] take up your cross and follow him amen
[39:42] you you must be willing to take up your
[39:45] cross and follow Jesus and don't be
[39:47] ashamed of it
[39:49] amen Paul said I'm not ashamed of the
[39:51] Gospel of Jesus Christ because it's the
[39:54] power of God's salvation to have a one
[39:55] to believe
[39:57] praise God are you with me

[57:59] Eagles be gathered amen that was
[58:01] something new Amen in their hour it

[58:07] uh uh uh oh oh but it was a new thing
[58:09] that God was doing amen God was bringing
[58:13] them from law Amen to Grace amen but it
[58:16] was hard amen for them to understand
[58:19] because they had the law amen and you
[58:21] couldn't tell them that they didn't have
[58:24] the law because Paul said concerning the
[58:26] law I was a blame aimless amen amen I
[58:30] kept the Lord Faithfully amen and you
[58:33] couldn't tell me the law wasn't right
[58:35] because God gave it to Moses and I'm
[58:38] standing on what God gave to Moses and
[58:41] if God was good enough for Moses and
[58:43] give me four Moses it was Israel and
[58:47] amen before Israel it was Abraham amen

[59:03] we can understand this there's no
[59:06] religion this new thing this new God
[59:08] that he was worshiping what's going on
[59:12] what's going on here y'all worshiping
[59:14] another God
[59:16] ain't gonna have that
[59:18] you think I'm gonna take that
[59:20] I'm gonna stand up for my God
[59:23] because it was a revelation that was
[59:25] breaking
[59:26] when Revelation is breaking it's hard
[59:29] for amen people to understand when God
[59:32] is removing amen the doubts and the
[59:34] fears he gotta amen send a messenger
[59:37] before amen Jesus amen before his pain
[59:40] he said amen to declare amen that Jesus
[59:44] Christ amen he said the Kingdom of

[1:00:04] Elijah
[1:00:05] amen but what happened they didn't want

[1:00:10] receive John Shirley they wouldn't
[1:00:12] believe Jesus

[1:00:17] Jesus Christ is the Minister of the
[1:00:18] Bride
[1:00:20] amen I believe that you and I am in uh
[1:00:24] hallelujah we're given the same Ministry

[1:00:31] the word has come amen he said father
[1:00:34] make them warn even as we are one I
[1:00:36] believe this is headship time
[1:00:39] I believe that we're coming into the
[1:00:41] Oneness of God I believe that in order
[1:00:44] for him to be married he want to be
[1:00:46] married back to the word
[1:00:48] I don't want I don't think he's going to
[1:00:51] marry he meant something uh other than
[1:00:53] the word and I believe you got to become
[1:00:56] the word bride amen you become Mrs Jesus
[1:01:00] Christ isn't that because you are the
[1:01:03] same bone of his mouth flesh of his
[1:01:05] flesh the light of his life Spirit of

[1:12:56] was doing the will of God he thought
[1:12:58] that he had made the right decision when

[1:13:56] because they know not what they do
[1:13:58] they don't understand Lord help them and

[1:17:16] sins
[1:17:18] that you might know his will because he
[1:17:20] thought he knew the will he didn't
[1:17:24] a lot of times we think that we know
[1:17:27] God's will
[1:17:28] but God has to stop us long enough
[1:17:32] he said that you might know the will go
[1:17:34] ahead

[1:20:46] you're just trying to tell them the
[1:20:48] truth or the word well folks get upset
[1:20:51] with you mad at you angry and want to
[1:20:54] hurt you
[1:20:56] because what they want to justify their
[1:20:59] own
[1:21:00] because the light has not shined in them
[1:21:03] yet
[1:21:04] as the lights
[1:21:06] was
[1:21:08] given to Paul he saw the light and when
[1:21:11] you see the light you see that it'll
[1:21:13] lead you in the right direction
[1:21:17] he said the 20th verse it says
[1:21:20] and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen
[1:21:25] was shared I also standing by

[1:21:33] you see see how far folk can go with
[1:21:36] thinking they're right
[1:21:39] Heaven get a man stoned to death
[1:21:43] because you think you're right
[1:21:46] Jesus didn't do this forgive him

[1:21:52] cause harm or damage to nobody on
[1:21:55] purpose
[1:21:57] I am not saying you not don't offend in
[1:22:00] word or indeed amen but on purpose
[1:22:04] you see what I'm saying the love of God
[1:22:06] in your heart

[1:24:24] speaking to him he hadn't heard the
[1:24:26] voice of the Lord so the law was
[1:24:27] speaking to him but he thought it was
[1:24:29] Eli calling him
[1:24:30] he said here my Lord amen he and then he
[1:24:34] was open God Amen had some words to
[1:24:37] speak to him to use him as a child
