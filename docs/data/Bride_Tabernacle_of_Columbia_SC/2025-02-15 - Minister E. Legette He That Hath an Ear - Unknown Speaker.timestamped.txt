[34:50] that's our doe to give him all the glory
[34:52] right no glory to man but it all goes to
[34:55] who God Amen m 11 by the grace of God we
[35:00] start here at the um at the at the
[35:03] seventh verse
[35:06] amen it's a little something that I've
[35:08] been ministering on 7 11 and 7 you got
[35:11] it say amen amen and it reads and as
[35:14] they departed Jesus began to say unto
[35:16] the multitudes concerning John what went
[35:19] ye out to the Wilderness to see a reed
[35:22] shaken with the wind but what went ye
[35:25] out to for to see a man CL in rayment
[35:29] behold they that wear soft rment are in
[35:32] King's houses you may be seated I'm
[35:34] going to read a little further
[35:36] down by the grace of
[35:38] God but what went ye out uh to
[35:42] see a prophet yay I say unto
[35:47] you and more than a prophet for this is
[35:50] he of whom it is written behold I'll
[35:52] send my messenger before thy face which
[35:54] shall prepare thy way before Thee verely
[35:57] I I say unto you among them that are
[35:59] born of women there have not risen a
[36:02] greater than John the Baptist not with
[36:05] standing he that is least in the Kingdom
[36:08] of Heaven is greater than he for and
[36:11] from the days of John the Baptist until
[36:13] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffer
[36:15] violence and the violent taketh by force
[36:18] for all the prophets and the law
[36:20] prophesied unto John and if you will
[36:23] receive it this is Elias which was for
[36:26] to come he that have ears to hear Let
[36:29] Them hear but where unto shall I liken
[36:33] this generation it is like unto children
[36:37] sitting in the markets and calling unto
[36:39] their fellows and saying we have piped
[36:41] unto you and ye have not danced we have
[36:44] mourn unto you and ye have not lamented
[36:47] for John came neither eating nor
[36:49] drinking and they say ha the devil and
[36:51] the son of man came eating and drinking
[36:53] and they say behold behold a man
[36:56] gluttonous and a wine biver and a friend
[36:59] of the publicans and sinners but wisdom
[37:02] is Justified of her children may God
[37:04] blessed the reading of his word this
[37:06] tonight by the grace of God just for a
[37:08] moment I want to minister and it's just
[37:10] a little continuation on I was talking
[37:12] about the call last week but I want to
[37:15] talk about he that hath an ear amen he
[37:18] that hath an ear you know what says many
[37:20] of times you know uh you can read read
[37:25] something but don't understand it amen
[37:26] amen and that's what that's what I
[37:28] believe has been a
[37:30] plague throughout all world history you
[37:33] know the people not saying that they
[37:35] didn't have scriptures or things for
[37:37] their day that they were looking for but
[37:39] though they read them they never
[37:40] understood them right just to have the
[37:43] the letter or intellect of the word that
[37:45] won't do you no good without no
[37:47] understanding right because once you
[37:49] know we in understanding that we talking
[37:51] about is not not intellectual
[37:54] understanding but the revelation of it
[37:55] right the revelation of the word to
[37:57] cause something to it'll open your eyes
[38:00] and your ears amen but we find that we
[38:02] always found that you know the people
[38:04] had eyes but they couldn't see right
[38:07] they had ears but they couldn't hear
[38:08] even the ones that was following the the
[38:11] the the messengers for that day they had
[38:13] eyes but they couldn't see amen ears but
[38:15] they couldn't hear exactly right so the
[38:19] thing about it is what what gives you
[38:21] the ability to hear I said he that hath
[38:23] an ear but what gives us the ability to
[38:26] hear come on
[38:28] what gives you the ability to see is the
[38:31] Holy Ghost amen am but sometimes you
[38:35] know people forget all about the Holy
[38:37] Ghost forget all about the spirit but
[38:40] the spirit is what brings life to the
[38:41] word amen you know you can have just a
[38:44] letter of the word but it takes the Holy
[38:45] Ghost to come and Quicken the word amen
[38:48] come on but that's forgotten a lot of
[38:50] places y'all believe that I know it is
[38:53] we get that but we we get so much
[38:56] intellect but the Holy Ghost is what
[38:57] brings life to it and that's what you
[39:00] know I I was saying the other day you
[39:02] know when when Israel was coming and and
[39:05] swallowing up all the other nations in
[39:07] the land they weren just afraid of
[39:09] Israel just because of Joshua and Israel
[39:11] but they knew that they had the
[39:12] supernatural among them amen and that's
[39:15] what made the other nations frightened
[39:18] because the supernatural was among them
[39:20] cuz they can look at Israel and knew
[39:22] that they were a small people they were
[39:23] a group that just came out of slavery
[39:26] for so many years but yet a Red Sea
[39:28] opened up before them amen yet they were
[39:31] in the wilderness for all those years
[39:33] and they survived not even their shoes
[39:35] was wore out right come on so when they
[39:38] looked at that nation that didn't even
[39:39] seem like they had a home but yet they
[39:42] had they had a prophet among them right
[39:44] they had signs and wonders they ain't
[39:46] even had to fight many of the battles
[39:48] God fought all the battles for them
[39:49] didn't he but the Supernatural is what
[39:52] made the difference didn't it I remember
[39:55] once when all the kings got together
[39:57] because they knew Joshua them was coming
[39:59] and they started calling out to each
[40:01] other just like demons do today they
[40:03] start calling out to each other let's
[40:05] bond together because Joshua coming
[40:07] right but I hear in the scriptures what
[40:10] God told Joshua don't be afraid the
[40:12] Bible says that they was like the
[40:14] multitude of the Sands of the sea or
[40:16] whatever it was the other nations was
[40:18] and they gathered themselves together to
[40:20] go to battle but God told Joshua don't
[40:23] you worry about how many don't pretty
[40:26] much don't even look at the situation
[40:27] that's at hand he said tomorrow they I
[40:30] will deliver them all up slain before
[40:32] Israel right and he said I want you to
[40:34] take their horses hack them the church
[40:36] hack them what because God meant
[40:38] business didn't he and that's what it is
[40:40] when you understand that this ain't our
[40:42] battle amen come on now come on Amen the
[40:46] battle is not ours but The Battle
[40:48] Belongs to who it belongs to God Don't
[40:50] It come on and I don't know but I know
[40:53] one thing God is mighty in battle amen
[40:55] come on he ain't never lost one did he
[40:58] so when we looking at it you know when
[41:00] we trying to intellectually or look at
[41:02] the word and trying to intellectually
[41:04] figure it out then that'll make us you
[41:06] know sometimes worried about this and
[41:08] worried about that but when we're not
[41:10] trying to intellectually figure it out
[41:12] right because the Holy Ghost down
[41:13] revealed to us that we shall overcome
[41:16] Hallelujah we've already overcome by the
[41:18] blood of the Lamb come on how important
[41:21] that blood is Right amen so the Holy
[41:23] Ghost revealed that to you that hey
[41:25] you've already overcome because I've
[41:28] you live because I live Hallelujah so no
[41:31] matter what comes our way what kind of
[41:33] condition we find ourselves in be not
[41:35] dismayed be not discouraged the Lord is
[41:37] going to fight all our battles amen come
[41:40] on and that's what that's why I was
[41:42] saying the other week you know um I was
[41:45] picking at uh uh uh sister pan and Ma
[41:48] they was getting on me telling me I'm a
[41:50] I'm a

[41:55] thing about it is we a ain't governed
[41:57] about who's ever in the White House
[41:59] who's ever doing that we're not governed
[42:01] by this government right but our
[42:03] government is of god ain't it am so even
[42:05] if they talking about shutting this down
[42:07] shutting that down you got to remember
[42:09] that I've never seen the righteous
[42:10] forsaken nor his seed begging for bread
[42:13] that's the government that we up under
[42:15] hallelujah amen the government that we
[42:17] up under you know he'll supply all our
[42:19] needs according to what his riches and
[42:21] Glory right amen they can shut down the

[42:41] the truth but what it is you got to
[42:43] believe that right amen amen come on but
[42:45] I says that you know what it is
[42:49] sometimes we can read and and don't
[42:50] don't un understand what you're reading
[42:53] right come on and it takes this you know
[42:55] sometimes we and all the time we we read
[42:58] the scriptures and things but even in
[43:00] Reading we get it retain it in our minds
[43:03] right in our spirit but I believe in the
[43:06] time need what happens and many of times
[43:10] in our hardest trials and tribulations
[43:12] we praying looking for God to move and
[43:15] and the word there something about the
[43:16] Holy Ghost he quickens the word that's

[44:13] mountains all these are the work of his
[44:15] hands amen come on amen hallelujah amen
[44:19] that's the truth ain't it amen but you
[44:22] know I says that so so we're not we're
[44:25] not moved by these things right amen I
[44:28] like how I believe it was Paul he said
[44:29] none of these things move me right come
[44:32] on what if God I believe that you know
[44:35] in when we talk about a
[44:37] squeeze when we talk about a squeeze it
[44:40] look like all of your your resources are
[44:43] dry up right amen The Squeeze come on
[44:46] the world look like all the resources

[44:50] resources dry up I can hear God saying
[44:53] get the by the Brook right amen amen
[44:55] come on Amen
[44:57] I believe that amen hallelujah get get
[45:01] by the Brook come on I don't know about
[45:03] you but I'm looking for God to do
[45:04] Supernatural things cuz when the enemy
[45:07] when he coming in that's what the
[45:08] scriptures is got to come alive to you
[45:10] come on somebody oh we got this come on
[45:13] no the Bible's got to become alive to
[45:15] you you got to be able to look at
[45:17] present day situations and see it in the
[45:19] word hallelujah and if God did it for
[45:21] them Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ is
[45:24] the same yesterday today and what
[45:27] forever if he did it for them he's that
[45:29] same God he'll do it right now same
[45:31] situation same God same results ain't it
[45:36] come on I believe that tonight you know
[45:39] but what it is that's why you know a lot
[45:41] of things happen among the people but
[45:44] they didn't have eyes to see it did they
[45:46] amen come on didn't have ears to hear it
[45:49] but I like how Jesus was telling him
[45:51] because even John said go ask him is he
[45:53] the one or shall we look for
[45:55] another right amen but what Jesus said
[45:59] is the perfect answer what you see stay
[46:03] around a little while what you see go
[46:05] tell John what you see come on Amen and
[46:09] when John you go back and tell John what
[46:11] you seeing things he here he'll know
[46:13] then right hallelujah amen because the
[46:17] things that was happening around them
[46:19] should have opened their eyes to what
[46:21] that this is the Living Word right we've
[46:24] been hearing it we've been waiting on it
[46:26] but things they saw should have opened
[46:28] their eyes and say this is the Living
[46:30] Word right amen amen this is the word
[46:32] you know when that woman at the well
[46:34] when she she was looking for The Living
[46:36] Word though wasn't she amen she might
[46:37] have been in her condition but she was
[46:40] taught to look for certain things right
[46:42] so when Jesus did a certain thing she
[46:45] said we know when the Messiah come he'll
[46:47] do this amen come on and when he told
[46:49] her I'm he something happened to her
[46:51] didn't it that's what it is she had ears
[46:53] to hear it didn't she she had eyes to
[46:56] see it Hal
[46:57] amen something Quicken and that's what I
[46:59] said don't miss your day in this
[47:01] visitation come on God has called you
[47:03] out to bring you in I believe that amen
[47:06] come on but we get relaxed on the
[47:08] journey God has brought us out to take
[47:10] us in don't get relaxed amen when all
[47:12] these things happen around us don't let
[47:14] Don't Let Jesus say hey I mean don't
[47:16] don't let the spirit say hey this is
[47:18] what it was but you missed it don't miss
[47:20] it I said God I don't want to miss it
[47:22] but I want to catch whatever you doing
[47:24] in this season Lord don't do it without
[47:26] me open my eyes open my ears Hallelujah
[47:31] but it's going to have to take the Holy
[47:32] Ghost doing that now come on how you got
[47:35] to be down on your knees in prayer to
