your own salvation amen Jesus can work it out 2 and 12 it says through 17 I'll read the first you read the next and we'll read the 17 together where my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling 13 do all things without mumbling and disputing 15 holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labor in vain together yay and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith I joy and Will Rejoice with you God bless you may be seated Hallelujah you know I was in prayer and praying I says Lord I heard James said faithful without works is dead amen amen in the Book of Revelation you know I was reading about uh the sard age he said you have a name live that you live but you're dead and he said I've not found your works perfect so in uh Revelation or 14 I'm going to the end before I get to the beginning Revelation 14 and 13 so by the grace of God we live in an age where amen it's just formality we come to church we come the church as sometimes the people have made it more entertaining and uh almost like you come to see a concert or uh you know and they take up so many offerings like you're paying to see a concert but we come to church and we ought to come to church to worship God Amen and we ought to worship Him in spirit and in truth he said I therefore the prison of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation whereever you are called with all Loess and meekness endeavoring to keep the unity and you know I I thought about that and I thought about I beseech you that you present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is your reason for service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind there's a conforming to the world and there's a transforming that takes place by the Holy Ghost now you can be conformed or you can be trans form are you with me some often times the Christian is is conforming to the world instead of being transforming instead of allowing the Holy Ghost to transform and they conform okay I'm not going to get into that because it's not for Sunday morning amen but anyway uh Revelation talks about dead Works amen Revelation three talks about dead works I you know I don't want go I I don't believe God is satisfied with dead Works amen and then uh uh Hebrews 6 says leaving the principles of the doctrine amen and then it talks about dead Works he he said no Revelation say that you have a name that you live and you're dead Philippians said about Philippians I mean Hebrews 6 talks about dead works okay so here we are I don't have time to go through all the scriptures so one talks about dead you have a name that you live but you're dead Okay and the others talk about let us leave the principles of the doctrine of the land hand on the hand and so forth and repentance from dead work are you with me so we need to go ahead on because sometimes our works is dead and I thought Lord surely the Harvest is plentiful we in the end time in this end time you look around the Harvest is pitiful but the labors are few when Jesus called you know I I wrote down payday pay payday you're going to get paid whatever is right you get paid that's my subtopic payday are you with me he said whatever is right I'll pay are you with me God is a just God and he's going to pay you what's right whatever whatever and then in my little prayer I said who you working for look at somebody ask who you working for cuz you know if you work you expect what you expect to get paid but you got to realize who am I working for you know you we often times uh sing the song My M Mama used to love to hear that song when I made the work I've done are you with me but the work you done May the work I done what speak for me but you want your word to speak for you okay so look uh Revelation uh 14 I said right Revelation 14 and 13 it says here excuse me 14 and 13 they probably got it up there before I get it 14 and 13 it says and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me who's he talking to who's he talking to I Heard a Voice from Heaven say unto who who Who's me I hope God is talking to you I hope you hear him talking to you I Heard a Voice from Heaven you know John was talking about that day but can you personalize it can it be personal to you and I would it work for us now amen is the word of God present tense amen the Bible said okay it's right blessed are who blessed are the dead that what die in the Lord die in the Lord now we understand that when we become Christians we die to ourself for Romans 6 said we were buried with him in baptism into death the like as Christ was raised from the dead even so we shall rise to walk in newness of what life are you with me so we die to ourselves but we live as those that are alive from the dead death has no more dominion over us so he said if we then be risen with Christ then in Colossians 3 seek those things which are what above above for my oh I I'm not going to get into my life is here with Christ in God are you with me so he says here blessed of the Dead which die in the Lord from hence forth yay said the spirit for they what uh that they may what that they may what see the Bible said come unto me all you that labor heavy Laten and I'll give you rest resten see a Christian Life we're not amen we're not working for the devil no more but we're resting in Christ we'll cease from our own Works amen we used should do our own thing we're not doing that anymore are you with me so he said that they may rest from their labor now it's talking about in the kingdom of God when we in the kingdom of God brother and sister we are labels with him we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus and the good works we're working out our own soul salvation working out our own salvation with fear and trembling surely God called us into the kingdom he calls each and every one of us as Christians for a purpose surely there's a work that I can do are you with me God calls you because he saw that it was a work that he called you to do but when I I first became a Christian the first thing I wanted to know uh as a Christian what can I do I just didn't want to come to church and come into church and sit down and look around and as though I I I just is that that's not me I don't know about you maybe you you just feel happy sitting around doing nothing you know what I'm saying I was talking about Betty and Frank how we didn't have to worry about visiting the sick cuz they were going to be there visiting now they done got up in age and we got to get somebody to take their place you know what I'm saying they was going to visit if you were in the hospital or whatever they was going to visit amen so by the grace of God there's a work that I can do are you with me you must some people just get saved you know what they do they just sat there and just look I I can't understand that I I couldn't understand that I believe when God saved you he saved you for a purpose it's a reason why he saved you first of all I said I can't sing I'm scared to stand up in front of people so I never preach so I can't do much of nothing I can't I couldn't see nothing that I could do I can't have read so I sure can't teach nobody so I I said what am I going to do I almost look at myself and that made me feel kind of bad cuz I couldn't see within the church anything I could do and I so the bishop told me go sang on the choir and y'all remember brother Jackson Kenny he came out he said did say that sing this I said I can't sing I'm just being obedient he told me to come sing on the choir I I know I can't sing and he had to know and he told me sing and I cried he said okay do this he said you said the right thing you can't saying so so he gave me some notes and I thought I was back in music in high school in music he gave me the quarter note half note I I knew all of that but I wasn't interested in that when I was in school I was interested in knowing all those notes and I said I ain't going back there and I didn't go by I tried to be obedient you know but I knew I couldn't sing all the time you know what I'm saying but I wanted to do something so it was later on then when I got in a small group and small atmosphere where it was about 20 people in the whole church but 30 at the most then I could work in there I started teaching Sunday school working with the young people and all of that that was in my brother-in-law church so little by little I gained a little you know I could do something and in the big church where it's 500 whatever or more people I I felt out of place I I felt you know I'm but surely doesn't work but I wanted to do something I just didn't want to just come to church I want wanted to do something but I find that what's the difference now I believe when God save you you it said let your light shine you you want to be involved I'm G tell you something people that I find that get saved and not involved in the church they're not going to stay long they usually going to go back out there and they're going to work for who they've been working for before they got saved if people don't want to be involved in the church they're not going to stay in the church when they get out of environment and they don't want to do nothing you know they're not going to stay you ain't got to worry about a thing after a while sooner or later they're gone because they don't want to be a part of what's going on see Paul said help those women that label with me in the gospel isn't that right and and he recognized that Jesus had certain that ministered of their substance to him so they found a way of giving Paul had lyia or whatever they that had made things in so them and and was able to help out it it's surely that something is a meal you could cook a something that you can just contribute to the kingdom he said call for the praying women somewhere along the line I go I'm going find my place I'mma find my place in the kingdom and I'm going to be a part of God's kingdom because he called me for a purpose and have you found look at somebody and ask have you found your place surely there's a place there's a purpose and a place for you and you need to say Lord show me my place and show me my purpose see there's a purpose for you being in the earth amen you here for a reason am God could have not let you even come in this planet call Earth but you here because God allowed you to get here and while I'm here here Lord what is my reason for being here and my reason for being here is to serve and Worship the Lord while I pass on through to my eternal home then Lord let me find my purpose I want to know my reason why I'm here and I want to know my purpose because a person without purpose they're lost and confused and anything goes anything happen because I have no purpose am amen see when you go to school and you don't know what you want to major in you can minor in everything and you get a de Plum and nothing are you with me I I don't know what I want to do we get we give you one of those anything goes you know what I'm saying I went all these years and I got a depl in nothing you know what I'm saying but you got to find your place sometimes we go for a certain thing and it doesn't work out and then we have to change to this and we change to that until we find out amen what works for me am amen amen what I feel comfortable in doing so when I get ready to go out into the world I've gotten a a a degree I kind of know what I what I supposed to be doing am so in the kingdom of God people without purpose in the church find themselves doing nothing and get all confused and others confused because why I'm not doing nothing I'm talking you out of doing nothing see are you with me because you working for somebody whether you know it or not you are working okay he said let let me let me get back to this verse at the last part yay the yay said the spirit that they rest from their labor and their what their Works do follow them and that that it's sad that that people well I did nothing so you resting from your label what label Lord I pay my tithe and my offering I came to church what what what what do I contribute to the kingdom the man that had one Talent Jesus knew what to give him one because he knew was going to do nothing with that one are you with me so he gave him one where he wouldn't have no excuse but he said I'll take this one and I'll do what he multiplied what he did Buri it see the little that you got amen instead of multiplying it you take it and bury it you're not even interested in the what God gave you you'll bury that you'll find it insignificant I I'm insignificant you know how we play the pity game we play that uh uh pity and and and you're going to find out if you grow up folks ain't going to pity you you get on the job you better you better produce if you don't produce you you what out of here so you got to find amen that you going to have to produce in life and if you're not prod dting in life folks going to just run over you because you're not produced are you with me some folks don't want nothing and nothing for nothing but you got to have those that want to be productive they want something they want to see others have the Jesus that they got I want others to to know the Lord like I know him I want them to know the joy that I have the peace that I have I want others to experience the God that I serve am amen but if you are not convinced that he's good to you if you have not tasted and found out T and see that the Lord he is good but if you don't know how good he is then you don't want anybody else to have this Joy I'm saying but you got to get in a place do I really have I really experienced the love of God have I really experienced is Jesus Christ as my personal savior is he really real to me I am I fabricating or am I just going through the motion am I just putting am I impersonating or what am I doing am I going through the motion but I'm not doing nothing I'm going telling one of the worst jobs I had they were paying me good money for a high school graduate my brother got me the job and uh they gave me a an employ to show me what to do and I he showed me nothing and I said okay I'm here for 12 hours or 10 hours or 12 hours something like that and all I could do is walk around and play like I'm doing something I said it worked about two weeks I couldn't take it because I didn't know what to do and I didn't have nothing to do but if they were paying good money for a high school graduate but I couldn't stand it I couldn't take it my brother said just fake it I couldn't fake it you said you see me I be running he said what I he said but all the work I'm going to do all the work where won't be nothing left with some other folk but but see but but by the grace of God I couldn't take it I Quit for less money and everything and got a job where I'm doing something you see what I'm saying but you know a lot of folks they don't mind faking it as oh I'm a Christian H running all around I'm a Christian you know good and well you a you you're not leaving for the law you're not really any here you you you want to get paid but you don't want to worry a lot of folk want to want want to get paid but don't want to work I'm going to tell you something it won't work in the kingdom of God I got to close because uh I've been here up here too long Revelation 20 made the work I done speak for me I thought that I I thank God for my mom but that's a good song and I don't want I I want you to labor in the vineyard of God he come on in whatever's right I'll pay you that labor in the vineyard be sure that you don't labor in vain that your work that you do is not in vain amen are you with me because a lot of times our work that we doing it's in vain we working to be seen we working amen doing what we want to do but is that what God wants you to do I'm doing what I want to do yeah you might be doing what you want to do but you got to recognize that God has a work for you to do and it's not what you want but what he wants not my will but let your will be done God I want I want you to lead and guide me I don't want to lead and guide myself but I want to know that I'm in your perfect will Lord that whatever I do I want to hear you say Well done good and faithful servant in to the joy of the Lord amen I want to to know that it's pleasing in his sight and that God will accept my labor of love that I've done towards his name I want him to say Well done you know you don't know how often I feel like a failure I was just repenting God forgive me because you know I just ain't doing nothing for the Lord I I feel guilty I feel like God what am I doing am I getting anything done and I said Lord you know it's not about you know going to Mullins on Thursday here on Tuesday going pray on Saturday this on Sunday and it's not about all you doing getting something when you can get there this you know maybe flying across the country or flying over the seas but still I feel so am I getting anywhere am I achieving anything am I accomplishing anything I feel so empty and so unsatisfied I said Lord I need to do something for you I said you know I felt so I said Lord I Repent Lord I'm sorry I ain't doing I I felt so embarrassed because I feel like I just ain't doing nothing I ain't doing enough and I said God you know you you said brother you you I don't know how y'all feel but I feel like in I feel like I can do more more than I'm doing I feel like I can give God more than I'm giving and I said Lord just ain't this this thing ain't it
