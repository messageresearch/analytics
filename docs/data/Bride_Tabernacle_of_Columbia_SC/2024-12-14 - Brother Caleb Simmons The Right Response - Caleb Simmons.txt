Lord we thank you for your presence we thank you for your anointing tonight Lord move us out of the way Lord if we said none or thought anything that wasn't like you lord lord we ask that you forgive us now and Lord take complete control of the service tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen if you got your Bibles we'll turn to the Book of Numbers Numbers Chapter 20 real simple thought tonight we pray it'll be a blessing to you Numbers Chapter 20 and we'll start reading in verse two when you got it say amen amen amen and it reads and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and spake and the people ched with Moses and spake saying with God that he that we had died when our Brethren died before the Lord and why ha he brought up the congregation of the Lord into this Wilderness that we and our cattle should die there and wherefore have ye made us to come out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their face their faces and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall be given forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their Beast drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and the and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and said unto them here now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hands and with his Rod he smoked the rod The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and and their beasts also and the and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because you believe not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation un the land which I have given thee this this is the water of meah and because the children of Israel stroll with the Lord and he was Sanctified in them amen God bless the reading of his word you may be seated tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled the right response the right response and we see here where where the the children of Israel they were complaining to Moses they were complaining to their leader and they went to him and Moses went to God him and Aaron they went before God and God gave them a word and when he gave them a word Moses and them they came out and they did something that was contrary to what God said they did something that that God told them to speak to the Rock but that's not what Moses did Moses and Moses when he went cuz he got so Ang he got so flustered with the children that God had done so much for he got so agitated that he just took the Rock and he smoked the The Rock see but I asked the question did Moses have the right response see see many a times we get caught up with other people and and what they got going on and they put it on you and sometimes you'll come to your situation you'll come to your rock and do you speak to it or do you smite it thank you what is your response see they had they had something that God told them to do and what was their response when things when when things got tough what was their response when others came and talked all this negative stuff in their ears what was their response when they got agitated what was their response when things wasn't going the way that they wanted it to go in that moment but you see Moses he had a way that when it happened he there was a consequence to him striking that rock there was a consequence to him striking that rock and see his response had a consequence it was an unforeseen consequence he didn't know that God wasn't going to allow him to go in the Promised Land because he struck The Rock he probably could have went to God and said they was bothering me they was getting on my nerves they were saying all this all this this that and the other to me and that's why I stro struck the rock but you see his action had a consequence just because of how he responded in that moment to that situation had a consequence of him not making it in the promised land but you see you may have a response to a situation that you may think it has no conse consquence on me I can respond bad in this situation because there was so much going on I can respond this way because there was so much that I was dealing with in that moment but see this moment had a consequence where Moses and Aaron couldn't go in the promised land they died before they got in the promised land and I ask you what is your response do you have the right response when you put in difficult situations do do you have the right response when things get tough and things get rough do you have the right response when someone's saying something negative to you do you have the right response when when you get upset about five different things and somebody ask you a simple question I'm guilty of it myself where where you get so you don't even realize it that you bothered about five other things when you respond to that one question that's right and when it happens sometimes you the Lord got to check you and say what is your response the Lord got to come to you and say hey you didn't respond right and that's when you got to go quickly and say Lord I'm sorry and to that person I'm sorry for what I said it could have been the right thing to say but it was said in the wrong way and sometimes you can say the thing and is never received because of the the the the spirit that you have behind it it was the right words it was the right message but the spirit that you have behind it causes someone not to receive it it causes them to say you know I don't want nothing to deal do with that person cuz anytime something something get to a certain level a certain place they they they they act a certain way but that's not as Pastor said told me recently he said just because that's what's happening doesn't mean that's who you are and see sometimes God got to show it to you for yourself show you he got to put you in there so that you can see that I got the wrong response and sometime God allow you to come to a once tce tce three four times so that you can see yourself and realize I had the wrong response but see in this situation he only had one chance come on so you never know which response is going to cause God to say that was the one say he said later on he said before what I stand at the door and knock If any man open the door and come with me and I and I would let him sck with him as the scripture said summarizing but you see sometimes it's the it's the smallest thing that can have the greatest impact it's the smallest moment that has the greatest impact like the scripture says as you've done to the least of these you did it unto me as you might have done to the stranger on the street you did it unto me cuz sometime the Lord allowed them to be angels unaware and you didn't even realize you was doing that to to one of God's servants but you was having a moment as you say go ahead and and thought that that was okay that this response was okay In This Moment cuz I was dealing with this that and the other that doesn't make it okay that doesn't make that that that moment that that response doesn't make it okay amen and so you have to say Lord I need you to work on me see you got to go to God and say Lord there you're showing me that there's a little more work that's got to be done in me Lord there's a little bit cleaner I need to get Lord there's a little bit more that I need you to shape up and mold and and break this apart and break it back down and mold something else in this place Lord because Lord I want to have the right response you never seen Jesus slip up and I guarantee you he went through way more than you have you never seen him ever had had the wrong thing to say and the scripture says that you want to be just like him and if you want to be just like him then then something got to change something got to change in the inside that you can have that right response no matter whether you high or whether you low no matter whether you going through something or you having a greatest time in life it doesn't matter your response shouldn't change and if you want to check and see if my response is right all you got to go do is look just go look there's an example somewhere that you can follow and say okay that that applies to me many times if you don't know cuz you probably ain't read it so you have to read it to search it out and figure it out for yourself to know what's in there to know what's in there so I can have the right response I said I was I was reading and I thought about the story of Elijah in Second Kings in second Kings chapter chapter 2 in 2 Kings chapter 2 and I start in verse 23 let start in verse verse 19 actually and he said and the men of the city said unto elishah behold I pray thee the situation of this city is pleasant as my Lord seeth excuse me and the but the water is not and the ground Barren and he said bring me a new cruise and put salt therein and they brought it to him and he went forth into the spring of waters and cast the salt in there and said thus sayth the Lord I have healed these Waters there shall not be from then any more death of barren land so the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying of Elisha which he which he spake and he went from then unto bethl and he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou ballal head go up thou ballal head see even you are not immune to being picked on and some somebody said that they may justify how they respond because of what's happening to them and say you know he was getting picked on let's see what he did verse 24 he and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the Lord and there came forth two she Bears out of the wood and tear 40 and2 children of them look how he responded someone said he had a bald head when you think about it like that you said man that was enough to get cursed by God as children it didn't say adults he said children and 42 got killed by two bears because of he was getting picked on and he went forth from then to mount Cara and from thence he returned to Samaria and you see how this happened right after God had done something miraculous it wasn't like this was this just came out of the blue this happened after God had just changed the water and made it healthy for them to drink and it's been that way ever since that's what the Bible says and then right after that somebody came and picked on sometimes your greatest Trials come right after God does your greatest blessing yes yes and right after that that's when all this negative people start talking this that and the other oh God un bless you they think that they so much better than everybody else or or or this that and the other but right after that is what is your response to it what is what is that what is that doing for you cuz you have a choice in that moment you have a choice in that moment to say you know what I'm not even going to follow that up cuz God done been too good to me is that simple but in that moment the longer you sit there and think about it it becomes a personal attack to you and some of it is all in your mind and it's all in your mind where the devil is using that to get to you cuz he know that if he can distract you then you not going to be looking at God to do something greater you're not going to be looking it's going to take you longer to get to where God wants you to be because you got distracted about what this one said and that one said or this happened to me and that happened to me and see in that moment God is looking for you to elevate he's looking for you to say you know what that don't mean that much what you saying ain't got nothing to do with me because God is still good to me and see when you start to get that mindset things start changing it allow you to be in a better head space for yourself you start smiling more you start not walking around with your head down one one of my friends said your crown slipping said sometime you walk around your crown slipping and it's a real thing that I think about sometime when my head go down I say you know what my Crown's slipping and when your Crown's slipping you you you start thinking about that thing you know what I got a Crown of Life I got a crown that's greater than anything that's over here and I can hold my head down or I can look up and say you know what this is something precious that God has given to me this is something great that God has given to me and I don't have a reason to let my head be down say it may go down but it need to come back up see there there's something that you understand what is my response I understand that I could have this response and I could stay there but what good is that going to do me I could stay there and wallow there and the devil make it a nice comfortable place it's like it's like the nest with the they say the Eagles the baby stay there cuz it's nice and comfortable but eventually when it's time for that eagle to grow up the the the mother Eagle starts getting thorns and thistles and making that place not nice to be and sometimes God got to come Stir It Up so it's not nice cuz otherwise you would stay there and say that's good enough I'm satisfied where I am I'm satisfied where I am but when God goes to stirring up that nest and things get uncomfortable things don't don't seem to be working how you thought they would work these people that always work with me good now they now they got something bad to say I've been working with them for the last three months and they ain't heard every a bad word and here come this this thing that we got to work on and here they come I just had as a prime example I was working in a class and in this class the teacher put us in teams and and we work with the team the whole semester so from August to December and in the in this in this situation I had two other it was me and two other guys we had a wonderful working relationship everything in the projects was getting done and everybody was working together then we came to this presentation Lord have mercy so all of a sudden one of the teammates decid you know what I'm going I did this part and y'all do the other part so I'm working on the other part and this other guy he he show up at the last minute to work on work with me to get this stuff done and when we finally get the presentation done we we try to share it with our teammate and say hey we got to give we got to give a standing presentation we got to give something on the screen and we got to give it we got to speak with this present ation and then the president was like well I don't want to speak so I emailed the professor I said um what would you like with the group members is everybody had to speak the professor said everybody got to speak so I said oh Lord and and and it starts to bother you because and then we got done the presentation you know what the person said they said this ain't even sea level work now you done stayed of all night trying to fix something and when you ask them to give their input they say this is about sea Lev worthy wow now imagine I'm just going to be honest and human yes sir if that don't affect you then I don't know cuz it it affected me it did and I and I got to looking I'm just like how can it be like now we just did all this work and said because they was looking at other people did it now mind you they had never we had never given a presentation in person so they had never seen that part of the presentation and I said there's two parts to the grade like you do what you do up there and then you got to talk well I I'm blessed with what God gave me so I understood I I ain't have no problem with having with talking in the presentation so when we got and we were first up the next morning we was the first one in the class to get a presentation so I'm just like we don't me and the other God we practiced the presentation and we knew exactly what each other was going to say but we got someone else that has to speak but we don't know what they going to say so we got to choose what we want them to say and how we want them to say it and there's a whole lot of prayer going on Lord give us wisdom because it this grade was not just you amen amen sometimes you work in things where it's not just it ain't just you am amen and it's not just you that's got to get it done it's everybody got to come together and sometimes we get on well I'm going to do my part and however yours turn out is how yours turn out see you can't get that mindset and God don't want you to get that mindset say see see sometimes you got to work together and I said we done work from August to December and everything was working good and so you get now you like where is this coming from like you questioning yourself like where is this coming but we get a presentation in class and the Lord bless us and we have it and after class he like oh that was a level work right there now you mad again cuz you just like you ain't never seen us so you would never know that that this is somebody strength or this is somebody weakness but now now you looking at it and you saying it's all in how you respond cuz I could have the other guy he was getting upset cuz we asked to meet on on at this time I can't meet today we asked to meet at this time I can't meet today um we asked to meet before class we was going to show up early before class he said I can't meet now now we know he show up to class every time early for class all of us know that like we show up he already in the classroom and then we get a presentation and everything go well like to the point people was giving us compliments about the presentation and and and he said nah that's a level work and then couple days later the professor give us the grade for the project the Lord bless us we met hey we made a perfect score that that was the blessing he going to text the group chat phenomenal job the other person in the group going to text me did he say phenomenal I said listen sometimes it's all about how you respond because if I would have went at him we might have had a bad presentation because there would have been spirits in the room in the atmosphere with us going back and forth I said I'm not treating them any different than how I treated them all the rest of the semester and we had a good see God can work out all those things that you over there and you getting upset about in the moment yes you can get upset because it affects you it does affect you but that doesn't mean you got to stay that way that doesn't mean you got to take it out on somebody else sometimes you got to go go to God and say said Lord Hey listen if this was a situation in the past I don't want it to be in my future Lord I don't want this to come up again so the next time I'm working with someone I know how to respond sometimes just go about and say you know I got to do the best that I can and try to figure out a way to navigate this because everybody that you work with not going to be somebody you like working with everybody that you going to have to work with in life not going to be somebody that you upstanding but you going to have to figure out how to navigate it and when God allows you to have the right response he'll give you wisdom for how to deal with that situation he'll give you wisdom so that you can understand that you know all things work together to the good see just because you can have the right response God can bless everybody around you so you never know that God just decided to give us grace and favor just because you had the right response Hallelujah just because you had the right response God said you know what I'm going to make sure the professor give y'all a good and then we ended up me and this other guy we was we was really stressed about it cuz we was calculating our grade and we was trying to we needed a perfect score to get our a so we knew that we had to do this well and I came now I said it doesn't have to look like everybody else because we're not everybody else and see everybody they look at they want it a certain way but sometime that ain't the way God made you so you can't do it the way everybody else did it don't mean that their way is better than your way it just mean that God made us different and see I can only respond how God allowed me to respond and just because you responded your way doesn't mean that your way was wrong and my way was right it just mean that God made us different as long as it's not contrary to the word I got to put that in there cuz somebody might use that as a loophole said you said yeah uhuh see it's all about having the right response but your response got to come through the word of God and make sure that you know when you when you give that response you ain't saying it with malice you're not saying it with no no no hidden thing behind it you actually giving a true response cuz you want God to be pleased with it amen see God going to hold you accountable for how you responded right see that that's what you that's what you have to look at and say how am I responding and how is God going to look at it when he looks at me and said I I I realized that and said I believe the other person like the Lord blessed me to get a A in that class just because of that and I said you know I think about it I said it's a small thing to somebody but it was a big thing to me cuz I cuz at the moment you get upset with this and it really affect you because I've been in other situations where people have went behind your back and talked about you and said you didn't do this you didn't do that and and and it might have caused an effect a profound effect on you in in your grades but you see I said when I came to this one I said I'm not going to follow that up I'm going to go and do what I need to do and do the best that we can and lead the rest up to God and see that was my response to it and said when you come to that situation amen when you come to it how will you respond and I only told that as a testimony to give give to God praise and see and show you that sometimes it's all about how you respond it's all about what you bring forth and how you go to that person and how you treat them cuz cuz when it look back at it the person that looks wrong is going to be you not them right it's going to be you and then and then it's going to look like y'all got a problem with something that's very small that's very very very small whether we got it or not was all in God's hands in the first place but God wanted to sometimes put you in situation that you would have to be exposed to it so that he'll see what your response is cuz he know that if you can respond right in thisen when the tests get harder and they become more on the line than just a grade it might come to down to the line where it's your job where you have bills to pay where you got things to do that you know that you you got to have this job and then it's going to be a situation where God allow you and you put in there and God going to see how you going to respond and see God allows you to go through those things to show you that you can have you can have the right response and when you have that right response he'll do he can do more than you thought he could do he he can make the ways plain and the way smooth just because you had the right response just because see if Moses I wonder if Moses then would have had the right response they would have went into the land of flowing with milk and honey that's right it just he had just spoke to the Rock something so simple but when we and and you see what Elijah did when someone went to picking at him and and and I thought about I said sometimes the things that are magnified in the moment are not that big when you look at the big picture sometimes the thing that's going on in the moment is not that big when you look at the big picture but sometimes we looking looking at the thing that's right in front of us we don't see the big picture we don't see what God is trying to do behind the scenes and sometime God don't show you he just wants you to respond the right way in that moment he don't show you the end of the staircase he might just show you the next step that's it and sometimes he don't show you the next step he just reach out his hand and say trust me he don't even show you the next step and said when when you got to have the right response in that moment to say Lord I just trust you and take the step of faith and go on and you never know why God is telling you cuz you know what if he would have show you that that next step was actually two or three steps and there was two or three steps missing you wouldn't have took it cuz you would have got scared you would have said it's too far for me to go you would have said I can't do it all these seeds are doubt but God just reach out his hand and say trust me and he'll lift you all the way up he'll lift you and put you in places that only he could do and others will Marvel and said and Marvel and say how did you get here and they'll come to you and you'll say it was nothing but the grace of God it was nothing but the grace of God I start to look back at certain things and I realized in my own life that I'm only where I am because of the grace of God and when I realized that you know what God allowed me to be here because he wanted to put me in situation that I don't even know where he's taking me I don't even understand where he's taking me and why I have to go the route that I have to go but in those moments when God put it before me I have to have the right response I have to say Lord I trust you that no matter what you're doing I know that you're going to lead me to where you want me to be and when I get there maybe I understand as the song said better buy and byy but if I don't that doesn't worry me at all because I realize that where you place me is where you want me to be it's about my response when the things get hard because just CU he got you on a path to where he wants you to go don't mean it's going to be easy don't mean that things ain't going to happen where you going to have to go through situations where God is going to say I'm trying to show you that you got to get tougher so I can give you more amen like I got to take you through this because what's coming in the future is going to be harder than this and you got to understand that if I brought you through this I can take you through that amen amen amen and and see I understand that it's about your response in everything that you do amen but if God has it all in control you can trust that if I got the right response God is going to see this through amen I don't know how he going to work it out I don't know how he going to fix it I don't know how he going to do the things that he promised that he would do but somehow some way it's going to happen just cuz all I did was had the right response and say Lord I trust you amen and when I went to you and told you lord it's getting too hard for me I know that you wouldn't put more than I could bear so even when I'm going through I can turn to him and say Lord lift me up and let me stand and Lord plant my feet on higher ground see God can do those things all if you had a right response amen but when you have the wrong response it can lead you down a pathway that you that that you never thought just because you having a wrong response thank you Jesus and see see and just because like I I I was reading this and it started to I started to understand it more and more and I I went started thinking about the story of Esther and how she had the right response and and what she did and her response was say let's go pray let's go pray cuz this thing is greater than me amen this thing is greater than you this thing is greater than all of us together but if we all go to God she didn't just say let me pray she didn't say let let me and my people pray she said I want you to spread the word to everybody fast and pray everybody together cuz she understood that this thing wasn't an attack on me this thing wasn't an attack on you it was an attack on all of us and when she came to that response and and I liked it because when I was reading I said you know what her response was to hymon she didn't go to the king and say I want him dead she said I invite y'all to come eat not once I think she did it she did multiple times now can you imagine having your enemy there in the room with you know that they hate you know that they want to kill you know that they want to take your position and say come on over and eat at my house now how many of us would have that response how many of us would say you know I'm in a place that I I I I can invite this person over to my house even though they don't like me I can invite this coworker over to my house even though I know they talking about me I I can I can do something nice for them because just because I see that they need it because but I know that they talking about me and they saying all this and they doing I know this to be true Esther knew what type of person hmon was but yet she didn't let that stop her from doing something for him bless now hmon could have came to Esther and repented of all that and maybe it would have spared his life and his family but that's not what he did he got more jealous he got more ingratiated he got more upset about it to eventually es said this man is coming against me and my family and me and my people and the King had he couldn't change his word but he made a provision of a way of Escape for them and he told them if y'all attack them they can fight you and see and ain't nobody ain't nobody came against them like that but they made sure that hmon and his family they they they came against them and they were wiped out see God has a way that even though you can't see how you going to escape even though you can't understand how how you're going to escape cuz this decree was unreversed that was the law it was unreversed and because like Mori said how do you know that God ain't put you in this place for such a time as this how do you know that God had been building you up and taking you through things from your youth from your childhood to put you in a place for such a time as this how do you know that God ain't been preparing you and allowed you to get to where you are for such a time as thisall but you see she could have had the wrong response and said you know what I'm going to try to take my chances by myself she could have but that's not what she did she said I'm coming not on the behalf of me but behalf of all those that are with me all those that I may know and may not know I'm coming on the behalf of them she didn't just go for Mori she went for all the Jews amen amen people that she didn't even know she went to them and said not don't don't just spare spare me but provide a provision for all of them she was standing in the gap for all of them that was her response amen she had the right response and God spared him God didn't let no harm come to him because that he he would never leave them nor forsake them God had chosen them and he had put a way of Escape in there so that Esther could make it there so that she can stand for her people he did the same thing with Joseph but Joseph had to go through a whole lot to get there but in all those times that he was going through he had the right response he had the right response amen and if you was look and and and if you was looking for a reason why should I have the right response that's a reason cuz every time you had the right response God blessed it every time they had the right response God blessed it God allowed them even though the trials in Joseph life seem to intensify it got worse every single time he had the right response he told the truth about his brothers he get thrown in the pit he he he get thrown in the P then he get slowed into slavery then he work up to the highest position in part of her house and then the wife lie on him then he get sent to jail he get in jail he get to the get favored in the jail and then he told some people they dreams and they forgot about him that's right don't it seem like he going to the worst of the worst of the worst every time he go somewhere it's a demotion not an elevation and you and and and but but at the end he ended up second in command of pharaoh am but don't you think he he thought about it now why am I going through this why every time I do something right it seemed like something wrong happened to me why every time I do something to tell people the truth seem like something I go to something worse but see he he didn't see the end of the the line but God knew where he was going to end up amen see he had to take him through all of that so that he could save his family amen just think of the extreme things that God took him through just for his family sake amen that was the whole purpose that he could save his family from famine that God could allow them to to be in such a way that he elevated him and blessed him above anything that they probably ever could imagined amen that it saved not only them but all of Egypt from death amen just because because God wanted to place him there and all during that he had the right response so the question is what is your response when things get seem to get rough and things seem to get tough what is your response because in that moment you have a choice you have a choice and sometime the response ain't the fight amen sometimes you think it's fight or flight it's neither one of those sometime God just want you to just want you to be still and know in that moment he just wants you to be still and let him go ahead and talk and then go on about it and if you got to go and say Lord I Lord I need you right now and by yourself and you got to say those prayers because that was the response that was necessary cuz if you had responded it would have escalated it not deescalate but escalated the situation and God wants you to say you know what I'm going to choose to respond the right way it might be something simple it might be something something great but in the end of the day is it worth it see I I got something greater and a greater purpose than than going through this right now and and following someone up and going through they foolishness I got there's a greater purpose here and if I follow it up then I'm going to be just like you we going to be right here on the same boat no no and but God got something greater for me so in order for me to get there I got to go through this and when I go through this it might be something else but you know what all in that process God is elevating me God is allowing me to see you know what he got more for me than I thought amen I might have got I might have got compac right here that's why God had to Stir It Up cuz he want there's more for me than I thought there's more for me than I thought that I I could imagine right now but there's more for me amen and just realizing that I said you know what I got to change how I respond I got to change how I respond cuz when I'm responding this way it don't get better amen it just get worse when when I get elevated and raised up it don't get better it just get worse not for them for me amen and when I re and when you realize that things start to change for you but it ain't Until you realize it people can tell you mama and daddy sister and brother can tell you but when you realize it it start to change how you are and and it's really sometimes it's necessary cuz God wants to put you in places that you never thought that you would be but in order for you to get there you got to have the right response to the things that you going through and when you have those responses it allows you to God to use you as a light for someone else cuz you never know who was watching and seeing what you was going through amen and and they knew all the situ all the parts of the situation and say you know what that person different cuz if it was me and that's what they think about and they know that God there's something different about you there there's something that's standing out about you and that there has to be something and I want to figure out what that something is and sometimes it's not that you going to harvest the seed maybe you just planting the seed it's not that you may harvest the seed maybe you just watering the seed you never know if God allows you to cross over that gate who going to come and say you know what you was a light and you showed me that there was something better for me that's right amen amen just because of how you responded amen just want to encourage you tonight just to tell you that don't give up just because it looked Bleak and it looked hard in in the moment do not give up because you having the right response is having an effect you having the right response is having an effect and you might not even see the effect you may never know the effect that it is but you having the wrong response is having an effect too you you getting upset and all this stuff is having an effect too and it might be having an effect on you that's right that you can't see sometimes it takes other people to point it out to you and say hey you really you really um need to work on some things and it's true if you be honest with yourself you say you know what there's some things that I need to work on there's some things that Lord I need to get closer to you so you can draw this out of me that you can take this from me so Lord I can have the right response that no matter what situation I get in whether it's a pressure cooking situation I can have the right response amen cuz Jesus got there when he got on after not eating for 40 days and the devil tempted him so why not me if the devil can take Jesus through those things he can take me through those things but it was how Jesus responded that got him through that test it was how he responded that allowed him to overcome what the devil was trying to put in front of me and so if I if I can if I can have the right response I can overcome everything the devil tries to put in front of me if I can have the right response I can have a Victorious life if I can have the right response I can go and say Lord I understand that all of my help comes from you I can turn to him no matter what the what the situation is I can turn to him and realize that Lord you're going to bring me through Lord you're going to bring me through and I can continue live on that and continue to I seen you do it and I don't have to look to no further than in my own life I don't have to look to nobody else but what you've already done for me said it might be small to you but it was great to me and realizing that all I have to do is turn to you and said Lord I want to have the right response and know that you'll give me the right response you can put the words in my mouth that I don't even have amen that I look back and say you know that wasn't me talking and realize that there's a change that's happening there's something that's changing inside of me and I know that something got to change in order for me to make it in see it's got to be something that's changing cuz if you in the same place that you was a year ago then something is wrong something is wrong but God is showing us that hey if the hour is getting late then we should be getting closer if things are going on then we should be getting closer it's more of hey what what what is going on that I'm not getting closer to God how am I responding how am I how am I each and every day drawing nearer to him that's right because if I draw near to him he going to draw n to me amen [Applause] am praise the Lord Lord amen we thank God for the word tonight amen our response amen amen what do we say when Jesus takes us through trials and tests unconsciously and unaware how do we respond sometimes we don't even don't even know we've been tested until after the test is over and you don't know what God God is preparing us [Music] for until you find out that you're stronger after you've been through amen even in your failure God is talking to you telling you something amen so sometimes you said I fail but you know you don't have to stay in that condition amen amen God can show you your failure only to tell you that this is not you I don't want you to be that am amen so we thank God for the word let's respond when God speaks to us and when we going through things let's have the right response Amen Let us just stand how many of [Music] you have been tested lightly and then our heads a bound Hearts looking to [Music] him and you know within yourself you gave the wrong response maybe you thought indifferent in some weight that's holding you down and you want to say God I'm sorry I
