[25:21] even if you have your Bible ask you to
[25:27] turn with us if you will to the book of
[25:32] Deuteronomy the seventh chapter
[25:45] had thoughts upon our hearts minds and
[25:51] seemly this seems to echo out to us in
[25:56] our spirit and so we pray tonight a man
[26:00] that gotta give the increase and talking
[26:07] to some people to other day and just
[26:11] sharing with them you know that how that
[26:15] our lives has been impacted by this
[26:22] epidemic but I believe to us that it's
[26:29] an encouragement also it helped us to
[26:33] realize one thing that if God don't help
[26:39] us we are perish
[26:41] I believe if there's ever time and a
[26:47] people ought to really seek God and to
[26:57] really examine their lives to be certain
[27:02] that we have a relationship with him do
[27:09] you wanna meet seventh chapter six
[27:14] through nine
[27:17] it reads for thou aren't a holy people
[27:25] unto the Lord thy God the Lord that God
[27:31] had chosen thee to be a special people
[27:35] unto himself above all people that are
[27:41] upon the face of the earth the Lord did
[27:45] not set his love upon you nor choose you
[27:50] because you were more in number than any
[27:53] other people for ye were the fearless of
[27:57] all people
[27:59] but because the Lord love you I like
[28:03] that you know it's good to know that God
[28:06] loves us amen and because he would keep
[28:10] the oath which he had sworn unto your
[28:14] father's had the Lord brought you out
[28:17] with a mighty hand and redeem you out of
[28:22] the house of bond men from the hand of
[28:26] Pharaoh king of Egypt one more place the
[28:34] Book of Leviticus I want to come back
[28:36] here to do your army but the Book of
[28:38] Leviticus just one scripture Leviticus
[28:45] the 20th chapter
[28:56] in 26 you shall be holy unto me for I
[29:04] the LORD am holy and has served you from
[29:08] other people that ye shall be mine
[29:14] blessed father the word tonight in Jesus
[29:17] name Amen we be seated I want to speak a
[29:24] few minutes by God's grace to you
[29:28] tonight on a little thought of our
[29:32] peculiar and holy people a peculiar and
[29:38] a holy people I realizing as God here
[29:49] was talking to Israel because that
[29:57] Israel was in Egypt in bondage under the
[30:04] taskmasters now eat it was a type of the
[30:09] world they were in condition that they
[30:12] were putting heavy burdens upon the
[30:15] people and Israel begin to cry out to
[30:20] God for deliverance you know I've found
[30:26] that it's good to know that you can call
[30:30] on God when you need help sometimes we
[30:36] fail to recognize where our help really
[30:41] come from but you understand that when
[30:48] nothing else can works God is the answer
[30:54] no doubt especially we are thinking
[30:58] within our minds you know about a
[31:01] peculiar in a holy people peculiar
[31:07] on-screen
[31:10] holy people I like that part because
[31:14] it's not so much that you make yourself
[31:18] holy but it's because God is holy and in
[31:25] that when we recognize that our God is
[31:30] looking for holiness he's looking for
[31:35] not just a holy name that's been tagged
[31:39] on you but he's looking for his life to
[31:45] the well in you and then when that life
[31:49] the wells in you then it's a holy God in
[31:53] you it's not ourself man-made thing that
[32:00] we make ourself holy because of some
[32:05] creeds are some kind of laws that we
[32:10] have adopted but no it's because of God
[32:14] that we are serving his holy I wish that
[32:20] we can really understand that what
[32:23] holiness really is about because we have
[32:29] we may name for ourself and we put
[32:33] labels on ourself and we can scrub
[32:37] bylaws to try to make a certain church
[32:41] holy but there was no church holy it's
[32:47] God that is holy I believe it was God
[32:52] that when he spoke to Moses when he got
[32:56] to this certain place he said Moses take
[32:59] off your shoes because the ground you're
[33:03] standing on is holy ground see and more
[33:08] than is understood that I where he was
[33:11] at he was in the presence of God and
[33:14] where the presence of God is that's a
[33:18] holy place
[33:20] but now God
[33:22] presences is not so much what we call as
[33:26] we look at it as being in a particular
[33:29] church setting but God will still live
[33:34] in us innocent life of God the whales in
[33:41] us and then because of his life the well
[33:45] is in you it makes you holy but it's not
[33:50] a self-righteous act
[33:53] it's not something you work up it's not
[33:57] something because of or you do a lot of
[34:00] church rules and you keep the Sabbath in
[34:04] you do do this and you don't do that no
[34:07] that's not why you are holy see because
[34:12] of our churches had has made their own
[34:17] little bylaws you know to make their
[34:22] group holy than other people but that's
[34:25] all man-made but now listen I like this
[34:34] because in Deuteronomy 7 he said here
[34:39] now in 64 down on a holy people unto the
[34:46] Lord see God looking for holy people not
[34:54] to a church but God wants you to come to
[34:58] him God is looking for people that he
[35:06] chose see is it's not so much of what we
[35:12] choose but it's God that does the
[35:15] choosing it's God that one that chose us
[35:22] but why did he chose us here he said now
[35:29] that God had chosen me to be a special
[35:33] people
[35:35] unto himself above all people that are
[35:40] upon the face of the earth you know it
[35:43] is such a real thing that that people
[35:48] are really come to God
[35:53] cuz we go to church and we go to
[35:57] seminars and we go to different places
[35:59] but it's different than when you meet
[36:02] gods yourself and you have a personal
[36:07] relationship with Almighty God I believe
[36:13] that's the place that we need to is
[36:16] alright to come to church it's good to
[36:19] come to church but you've got to come to
[36:21] God see because God is calling you see
[36:29] so many times we almost you know look at
[36:34] that the church call us but the Bible
[36:39] said God is a jealous God he's not going
[36:43] to share his glory with no one why
[36:47] because he had a right to it why because
[36:51] it was him that gave his life for us no
[36:58] preacher no church no Crees know it was
[37:03] God didn't God give his life for us to
[37:11] take us back to himself
[37:14] and when he come to redeem humankind
[37:18] back to him again because we were lost
[37:24] no way that home the first man Adam and
[37:29] Eve when God made them and created them
[37:33] and they and lost fellowship with their
[37:38] Creator you know it's a terrible thing
[37:43] when you lose fellowship with your
[37:45] makeup so when you do you start
[37:48] wondering
[37:49] around wondering who are you what are
[37:53] you come to do and why you were here you
[37:56] search any way of trying to find out
[37:59] where you fit in you might go to the
[38:02] jungle you might think you a Bilson and
[38:04] you love that but she has to realize
[38:06] that you belong to God no man boss you
[38:12] about us that we are bought with a price
[38:15] and we are not our own that's why Paul
[38:20] said like this
[38:21] he said now the life that I now live see
[38:26] you may be living a certain lifestyle
[38:29] but it has to be a different lifestyle
[38:33] but understand this except God called
[38:38] you and chose you for it you know I just
[38:43] you know just remembering so well you
[38:46] know that how about I said that are in
[38:50] time past we were not God's people but
[38:56] God redeem us back to him now notice he
[39:01] also in a 7th verse of the seventh
[39:03] chapter you say now the Lord did not set
[39:07] his love I look at that word love see it
[39:12] was God love that did this his love can
[39:18] screen him to die for us at Calvary not
[39:24] that we deserve because we did not
[39:26] deserve it but yet God loved look beyond
[39:31] all of our faults and he saw we needed
[39:36] him
[39:37] I could imagine in a whole human race in
[39:42] Genesis when they had him and even lost
[39:46] everything and the whole world willing
[39:51] to chaos the human race now was lost
[39:58] without knowing God
[40:03] personalized way and God loved them so
[40:09] that he made a way back that they could
[40:14] come back and fellowship with him but
[40:18] you know God loves people but he hates
[40:21] sin he loves people but he hate the sin
[40:27] so God went and did something about the
[40:31] sin problem seeing that's the problem
[40:36] the sin problem at Calvary was settled
[40:41] he came to settle the sin issue what did
[40:45] he do he took it on himself oh I like
[40:51] that and he took it upon himself to die
[40:56] for people that was wretched and undone
[41:00] and gave us his life and he took our
[41:05] dirty life oh my what a mighty God we
[41:10] serve who would love a God like that who
[41:15] and I want to serve somebody then even a
[41:18] width to the Lord's region of hell and
[41:23] strip the devil there were all the
[41:28] powers that he ever had you know the
[41:33] powers of darkness that had covered the
[41:37] earth like it is somewhat today darkness
[41:44] has covered the face of the earth gross
[41:48] darkness getting so bad you know you
[41:53] just don't are the corruption and
[41:57] everything that's going on in the world
[42:00] even in this epidemic we having the sin
[42:05] hasn't stopped why because people hasn't
[42:10] recognized you know that God has
[42:13] redeemed them back
[42:16] and God wants the people to be a
[42:20] peculiar in our holy people see God is
[42:25] calling for holiness it's a standard
[42:29] that that God sent not just a holy
[42:34] church we call it but a holy God in the
[42:39] people
[42:40] Sika the word church means called out
[42:45] we've been called out of the world to be
[42:51] a different people to be a people you
[42:56] know that that has been converted to a
[43:00] people that have heard the voice of God
[43:04] and God called them by their name about
[43:10] us saying I have chosen to you since God
[43:15] choosing it's not the preacher it's not
[43:21] no church but it's God you know and I
[43:26] like that so much because you know when
[43:30] God chooses us he don't chew lead us on
[43:34] the basis of what we have he don't
[43:39] choose us on the basis of our
[43:42] educational standard or our economical
[43:48] standard or where we live and what we
[43:52] possess no god don't look at that if you
[43:57] notice in the Bible God or Jesus always
[44:00] went to those with out he went to the
[44:05] poor he went to those that were cast out
[44:10] he's very sudden went to the rich though
[44:15] he has so much people but God gave them
[44:19] the riches see there's no greater riches
[44:23] that you can ever have until
[44:27] you accept Jesus Christ as your personal
[44:30] Savior
[44:31] didn't you're rich so rich you you don't
[44:37] know what all you have there's another
[44:41] place I wanted to read I believe is Ian
[44:43] do you wanna me 14 let me try to jump
[44:46] over there for a minute
[44:48] I want to come back but this really
[44:53] struck me this morning that I was just
[44:55] reading my little devotion and I really
[45:02] started from right here do you wanna be
[45:03] 14 1 & 2
[45:14] Yatta cheated on the Lord to your God
[45:17] you should not cut yourselves now I make
[45:20] inter ball that's between your eyes for
[45:23] the dead for thou art an holy people
[45:27] unto the Lord thy God and the Lord had
[45:31] chosen B to be a peculiar people unto
[45:34] himself above all the nations upon the
[45:40] earth there were no scripture that God
[45:43] said that that that all souls are mind
[45:47] that we belong to him sometimes we get a
[45:52] little amnesia stricken because that we
[45:58] don't know who we belong to but God is
[46:05] that is the creator he is the one made
[46:08] us and he made us for his purpose here
[46:14] it also say now the Lord did not choose
[46:16] you in back in he was seven because you
[46:19] were great but he said you are the
[46:23] fearless of all the people see he said
[46:30] he did it because his love that he had
[46:34] for us
[46:36] not because you were more in number than
[46:39] any of the people for you were the felis
[46:41] of all people but because the Lord loved
[46:45] you and he expressing the love of God
[46:49] that he had for us and how he chose us
[46:53] in himself to be a peculiar people to be
[47:03] a holy priesthood to be acceptable in
[47:12] the sight of God see you a special God
[47:20] when God looks at you he's looking at
[47:23] himself because he made you to worship
[47:27] Him he made you to serve him he made you
[47:35] to be the blessed people on the earth
[47:39] you blessed you we just don't under
[47:44] realize how blessed we really are it is
[47:48] no effort that we've done of our own it
[47:51] was the grace of God God's grace mean
[47:56] that unmerited favor you found favor
[48:02] with God why because he loved you and
[48:08] God wanted to express his love what did
[48:13] he do he gave up his life oh I like that
[48:18] he he showed you how much he loves you
[48:23] now I'm gonna lay down my life
[48:27] what kind of man would do something like
[48:29] that then I lay down his life for
[48:33] ungodly people from people that didn't
[48:38] even who are what even serving him but
[48:42] yet God look beyond our folks
[48:49] and he saw your need I believe it said
[48:55] one place in the Bible no man can come
[48:59] to the Father except I draw him see God
[49:03] got a drawing power and God knows how to
[49:08] draw you see is God choosing you lot of
[49:17] people at this think something where I
[49:18] come to God when I get ready that's a
[49:21] mistake
[49:23] it's God does the choosing
[49:27] you just Hawking to the call about us
[49:31] immediate call but a few are chosen see
[49:37] a few many hear the gospel that's what
[49:45] the gospel is called the good news
[49:48] because it is good if I would say old
[49:53] pace and see that the Lord he is but you
[49:56] can't taste gods but when you try God
[49:59] and find out he's everything you've been
[50:03] looking for in more oh I'm dead I just
[50:13] love to know because I realize that how
[50:17] wretched and miserable I want us are no
[50:23] good for nothing should have been dead
[50:28] but because of God's grace and God's
[50:33] mercy on me somebody say my mother
[50:37] prayed for me thank God for godly
[50:42] mothers thank God for the old timers
[50:45] that begin to get on their knees late at
[50:48] night and say Lord wherever my child is
[50:52] Lord you can save them they knew how to
[50:57] get in contact with God see it wasn't
[51:00] just some mist
[51:03] they knew what they call along the heart
[51:06] with all their heart gotta come oh how
[51:11] thank God for having godly mothers and
[51:14] fathers that knew harder really get in
[51:18] contact with a real God now see that's
[51:23] the problem a lot of times we are giving
[51:26] the people some false hope that God is
[51:29] some great great granddaddy but no man
[51:31] no sir this God we're talking about
[51:35] he's right here right now all he's able
[51:40] to do for you more than what you can ask
[51:42] a think oh he is more than able to do it
[51:47] come on God hasn't changed what he did
[51:51] that did he can do it now we're not
[51:56] serving a historical God but we're
[51:58] serving a God of Hebrews 13 and 18 Jesus
[52:03] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[52:07] forever
[52:11] got a couple of reports by the pastor a
[52:15] couple of things that we have a prayer
[52:17] list there should be sure to tell them
[52:20] that they have fully recovered and fully
[52:25] it doctor fully released them you know
[52:28] it's good to hear good news our miss of
[52:32] the order negative there is some
[52:35] positive but you can't have the positive
[52:38] unless you got a negative because you
[52:41] need to both to get a reaction and
[52:44] that's what we need we need a spiritual
[52:48] reaction oh how we need to know and we
[52:53] call on God he'll come to our rescue
[52:57] he's never too late he never misses
[53:01] appointment
[53:02] somebody says he's an old-time god yes
[53:06] he is ah I know it for myself
[53:13] he did it for me sister sing that song
[53:17] you may never have been in a darkness oh
[53:22] but he did for me that's what the kind
[53:26] of God I'm talking about a God that
[53:29] loves you in spite of a God that don't
[53:34] come to condemn you
[53:36] but he wants to lift you up he wants to
[53:41] bring you out no matter what you are
[53:44] facing no matter what kind of shade you
[53:48] may look at your life tonight as being
[53:51] messed up oh but that's the time God is
[53:55] the master he knows how to take a mess
[54:00] and clean it all up
[54:03] and then give them the blessings and she
[54:07] will look back at your life and say how
[54:09] did he do it how did God do it how one
[54:15] time I was on the other side of the
[54:17] fence serving the devil you know selling
[54:21] drugs in the club but one day Jesus came
[54:27] my way one day he came my way I hope
[54:34] tonight that Jesus comes your way
[54:38] tonight if he ever comes your way your
[54:42] life can never be the same
[54:45] you'll be a new creature you'll live a
[54:49] holy life because there's a holy God
[54:53] that's in you the power of the Holy
[54:57] Ghost
[54:58] oh that's what the church world need
[55:01] they need Holy Ghost in order to live a
[55:06] holy life without it without the Holy
[55:11] Ghost you'll be struggling with things
[55:15] of the world you'll be struggling with
[55:18] habits but once you understand the
[55:22] struggle is over
[55:25] Jesus came to break the chains Oh My yes
[55:31] when he went to hell he scrubbed the
[55:34] devil of alcohol demons immorality you
[55:40] don't have to live that way anymore you
[55:43] don't have to be a liar you don't have
[55:46] to be a fornicator you don't have to be
[55:49] a drug addict you can come to Jesus well
[55:54] I hope somebody come to Jesus
[55:56] somebody somebody come to Jesus tonight
[56:02] realize that you might be in a mess but
[56:06] God got something better for you oh my I
[56:12] think about the love of God sometimes
[56:15] and where he brought me from look at how
[56:20] low he went let me tell you something
[56:24] God came in the crowd way I was no I
[56:30] wasn't in a church but God goes to the
[56:34] club's yeah but we can go there he got a
[56:37] purpose why he go
[56:39] no he going to get on a dance floor but
[56:42] God got a purple why because a Sun our
[56:46] dawn of God is in here and he said now I
[56:50] got to get him out I got to get them out
[56:55] of their situation they don't belong
[56:57] there they belong to me I thought about
[57:03] one time I was going into
[57:05] Newbery working is a turkey plant and I
[57:11] passed by our trucks coming from Marian
[57:13] going to Newberry and this truck had
[57:17] cages you know turkeys you know going in
[57:21] and I got to the plant where the turkey
[57:24] farm was and these trucks had these
[57:28] trailers that they had to pull in and
[57:31] they backed the turkeys Indian and they
[57:33] got fans that keep him cool because they
[57:36] got to be
[57:37] temperature but before they got to this
[57:39] certain stall one of the cages Oh No
[57:44] turkey pop open and what are the turkeys
[57:47] public huh from North Carolina somewhere
[57:50] he will ride us along and did we hear
[57:53] the speed bump the truck trailer knock
[57:57] him out I don't own the ground and he
[58:00] was just sitting there like looking at
[58:03] just my interpretation he was sitting
[58:06] there wondering maybe where he's at but
[58:09] he didn't realize he was free he kind of
[58:14] got up and hit the woods because the
[58:17] cage was open I want you to know your
[58:22] cage is open but don't just sit there
[58:27] staring at it run for your life that's
[58:32] what we need to do run with everything
[58:36] in you run oh my you can never get the
[58:43] people to understand that they don't
[58:45] have to be in bondage they don't have to
[58:50] live like that we living below our
[58:54] god-given privileges come on we ought to
[58:57] be living like sons and daughters of God
[59:01] we're going to be living like I like
[59:04] animals sometimes human live lower than
[59:08] an animal it's because they don't
[59:11] realize who they are your sons and
[59:15] daughters they're gonna give you not to
[59:19] make you stuck up but yelling make you
[59:21] feel real good that oh God thank you for
[59:25] all that you've done for me no doubt
[59:30] that night that I was in a club in God
[59:33] the voice the God spoke to me oh yes God
[59:37] got a mouth and God speaks
[59:41] and you know when God speak he'd know
[59:44] how to get your attention and everyday
[59:46] have you ever healed that voice of God
[59:49] it'll cause you Larry in a different
[59:54] manner I'm driving a peculiar holy
[59:58] people that one out there at that night
[1:00:04] it caused me to react differently
[1:00:10] because I heard something that I've
[1:00:13] never heard see the voice of God if you
[1:00:18] ever really hear it Anna calls you to
[1:00:20] change and you don't usually know why
[1:00:25] but from that day in 1987 was the
[1:00:30] beginning of a whole new different life
[1:00:33] that day when the voice of God spoke to
[1:00:36] me I never sold drugs anymore I never
[1:00:41] used it anymore
[1:00:43] I never touched I did even with the
[1:00:46] church yet see God can deal with you
[1:00:50] before you get to the church I heard
[1:00:53] somebody say I glad God got a hold of me
[1:00:56] before the church did cuz sometimes
[1:00:59] church messes you up but it's God the
[1:01:04] real God now this real God I'm talking
[1:01:07] about if he ever gets the whole of your
[1:01:10] life if you ever that's part of your
[1:01:14] scene when you hear the voice of God
[1:01:16] talking tonight you may be in your house
[1:01:22] you may be on the street you might even
[1:01:25] be in your car but hearken to the voice
[1:01:28] I believe God is still calling I believe
[1:01:35] he's calling more saying come on to me
[1:01:41] if you have a burden and you need rest
[1:01:46] my sister my brother come to God now
[1:01:52] don't wait what are you waiting for
[1:01:57] what are we waiting for
[1:01:59] so many time we'd like to try to wait on
[1:02:02] somebody else but no don'twe don't know
[1:02:06] but you come if God calling you you make
[1:02:11] the decision that's what I had to did
[1:02:15] even when I was in the county jail in
[1:02:17] that time and this preacher came in the
[1:02:20] first time the preacher came in I heard
[1:02:22] him preach that night and he preached
[1:02:25] the message great is the gate it was
[1:02:30] about 35 or 40 of us there and that
[1:02:35] experience that I had while continuing
[1:02:38] it in that prison the county jail that I
[1:02:42] mean that done Fela preached he even
[1:02:46] tell scrape is the gate it's an error
[1:02:50] always see it's not a Broadway but
[1:02:54] insolent narrowly but he said feel there
[1:02:57] be did find it all when you find that
[1:03:01] straight and narrow way regardless of
[1:03:04] what about a think about you they might
[1:03:07] call you crazy they might call you
[1:03:10] fanatic but come on don't worry about
[1:03:13] what they say you listen to the voice
[1:03:20] cuz it'll make you act strange
[1:03:23] it'll make you let's go to one more
[1:03:27] scripture oh my first Peter
[1:03:36] might be already even quoted thinking
[1:03:44] about these things I said Lord what else
[1:03:49] is it in life that people won't that can
[1:03:53] do them like you can do them that can
[1:03:58] change your desire you may have a desire
[1:04:04] to smoke a desire to do under godliness
[1:04:08] but God can chain that desire see God
[1:04:12] wants to to reroute your life see this
[1:04:18] virus may rewrite a people like but God
[1:04:21] want to rewrite it that's why he brought
[1:04:25] the change and well you can really look
[1:04:28] at life on really what it means to you
[1:04:32] they always say life is like a vapor you
[1:04:35] were here today and you go on tomorrow
[1:04:38] that's why we need to really understand
[1:04:42] what life really is real life is serving
[1:04:48] God letting eternal life come in and
[1:04:55] take out of you don't things that not
[1:04:59] gonna do you any good
[1:05:01] why hole oh I know what it's like you
[1:05:04] know the bill drugs and alcohol and wake
[1:05:08] up the next morning and start over again
[1:05:10] and there's one day after another after
[1:05:13] another after another but all one thing
[1:05:18] all it takes you know I'm understanding
[1:05:22] it don't take a lot of things but one
[1:05:25] word from the Lord can make a difference
[1:05:29] I'll pray the night that you just hear
[1:05:32] something from God tonight that I calls
[1:05:36] you to say I wanna change and so many
[1:05:40] times people do want to change but they
[1:05:42] don't know where to go they lost
[1:05:46] confidence in the
[1:05:48] reaches it he lost confidence in the
[1:05:51] church because all they want to give the
[1:05:53] people is a money institution people
[1:06:06] said while I give my money in like this
[1:06:08] and I ain't getting no benefits
[1:06:12] see you chemically you want some
[1:06:14] benefits you want something that you
[1:06:16] want to profit off of and God want to
[1:06:20] give you something and you can benefit
[1:06:22] from God wants you to walk different God
[1:06:27] wants you to live different so that's
[1:06:31] why he wants to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:06:34] and where you can become a new creation
[1:06:37] that your conversation the way you go
[1:06:42] I'll be different sometimes a the places
[1:06:45] I used to go I don't go anymore why
[1:06:50] because there's been a change in my life
[1:06:55] and I want to tell you something
[1:06:57] appreciate didn't give it to me I had a
[1:07:00] brother girl used to sing that song just
[1:07:03] joy did I have the world didn't give it
[1:07:07] to me oh he used to sing that song I can
[1:07:11] hear the air cooling down the house and
[1:07:13] he said nobody but Jesus gave it to me
[1:07:18] empty when Jesus give you something he
[1:07:21] he know how to finish it the work that
[1:07:25] he starts in you he knows how to
[1:07:27] complete it the God that same you the
[1:07:31] God that calls you in the garden is able
[1:07:35] to keep you
[1:07:37] I thank God he's not an India to give up
[1:07:43] but when he gives you something it's
[1:07:46] forever eternal life is forever once you
[1:07:53] ever obtain it and it's free no you
[1:07:58] can't pay for it
[1:07:59] you can't worry
[1:08:01] for it you don't earn it it's just a bit
[1:08:05] of fish of God's grace that he said you
[1:08:10] belongs to me
[1:08:12] he said come my sister come my daughter
[1:08:18] you've been looking at yourself as being
[1:08:20] so tore up you know and I realize that
[1:08:24] condition that I will always throw up my
[1:08:29] old family didn't want to have nothing
[1:08:31] to do with me I didn't want to be around
[1:08:35] because I felt embarrassed cuz I was
[1:08:39] living Lord and a son of God was forced
[1:08:42] to leave yes I went to church I heard
[1:08:47] the preaching I saw this singing in the
[1:08:51] shouting but I didn't get any of it it's
[1:08:56] sad to say sometimes you can go to
[1:08:58] church and you can you shout you can
[1:09:01] sing and you can just speak in tongues
[1:09:03] and do all those things yet not be saved
[1:09:08] but I promised the Lord I said God if
[1:09:11] you saved me God I'll go all the way
[1:09:15] here and that was back in 1987 now I
[1:09:21] never regret the choice that I made but
[1:09:27] it was one of my choice I heard the call
[1:09:29] and I'd realize that lord I need this
[1:09:35] see until you really recognize you need
[1:09:38] it you think your life is okay and
[1:09:42] that's the worst shape you're in when
[1:09:46] you think you're all right
[1:09:48] because when you think you all right
[1:09:51] that's when you really a miss church I
[1:09:56] pray tonight that you will look at
[1:10:01] yourself in a magnitude of the word and
[1:10:06] realize that God called you to be a
[1:10:09] peculiar holy people
[1:10:13] not just a person to come to a church
[1:10:15] but God wants your life he wants to
[1:10:19] purify you inside out I believe this
[1:10:25] experience that we need it's the inside
[1:10:28] out it starts intimately and then it'll
[1:10:32] work itself out I pray the night that if
[1:10:38] you were listening and you were tuning
[1:10:40] into us tonight and as the pastor come
[1:10:44] tonight that you know he lead us in the
[1:10:47] prayer and I hope that not only that you
