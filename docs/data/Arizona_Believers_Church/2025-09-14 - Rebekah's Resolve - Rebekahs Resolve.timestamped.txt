[0:00] Genesis chapter 24. I'm going to start
[0:02] with verse 10 and then read to verse 15.
[0:05] And the servant took 10 camels of the
[0:07] camels of his master and departed for
[0:09] all the goods of his master were in his
[0:11] hand. And he rose and went to
[0:13] Mesopotamia
[0:15] unto the city of Nahor. And he made his
[0:17] camels to kneel down without the city by
[0:19] a well of water at the time of the
[0:21] evening, even the time that women go out
[0:23] to draw water. And he said, 'Oh Lord,
[0:26] God of my master Abraham, I pray thee,
[0:28] send me good speed this day, and show
[0:30] kindness unto my master Abraham. Behold,
[0:34] I stand here by the well of water, and
[0:36] the daughters of the men of the city
[0:37] some out of the city come out to draw
[0:40] water. And let it come to pass that the
[0:42] damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy
[0:45] pitch, I pray thee, that I may drink,
[0:47] she shall say, drink, and I will give
[0:49] thy camels drink also. Let the same be
[0:52] she that thou hast appointed for thy
[0:53] servant Isaac. And thereby shall I know
[0:56] that thou hast showed kindness unto my
[0:58] master. And it came to pass before he
[1:00] had done speaking that behold Rebecca
[1:02] came out who was born of Bethuel, son of
[1:05] Milka, the wife of Noah, Abraham's
[1:08] brother, with her picture upon her
[1:10] shoulder. Amen. You can be seated.
[1:14] Such a remarkable story. And in verse
[1:17] 15, Rebecca's introduced to us. On
[1:20] Wednesday, we ministered on the first
[1:22] nine verses. And we looked at it from
[1:23] the standpoint that God uh Abraham in
[1:27] the as a type of God was composing his
[1:30] will and then he sends his servant to
[1:32] conduct that will each one acting out
[1:34] God's will and God's plan. And today my
[1:37] title is Rebecca's resolve. And uh
[1:41] there's different ways you may be able
[1:42] to take that title, but re Rebecca's
[1:44] resolve. And musically a resolution is
[1:48] that progression from dissonance to
[1:50] consonance. We looked at that idea of
[1:52] music having those different elements
[1:53] that compose a masterpiece. The good and
[1:56] evil, the difficult, the negative, the
[1:58] pressure, the stress, all those things
[1:59] we endure and how that God uses those
[2:02] things to bring forth great beauty and
[2:05] progression from in music to progress
[2:08] from that dissonance, those minors,
[2:09] those sharps, those things that maybe
[2:11] are foroding um and create suspense.
[2:13] It's progression from that to the good,
[2:15] to the consonants, the pleasing. And we
[2:18] wanted to, we've been using dissonance
[2:20] as a concept of fear or doubt or those
[2:22] things that may seem to be unsettling as
[2:24] it's characterized by suspense. You kind
[2:26] of have this hesitation or you're left
[2:28] hanging and you want it to be resolved.
[2:30] You want that note to resolve back on
[2:32] that pleasing tone. And so in using this
[2:35] thought on Rebecca's resolve, it's uh
[2:38] you can look at as her determination,
[2:40] but it is uh her her resolution of
[2:44] dissonance.
[2:46] And we know that there's even a thought
[2:48] on uh dissonance that it's that mental
[2:51] discomfort from conflicting beliefs. Uh
[2:53] something that is an opposition or maybe
[2:55] a paradox is unresolved. If it's a
[2:57] paradox and says, "Well, how can this be
[2:59] true? There's a paradox. If it's
[3:01] unresolved, that can kind of create this
[3:02] idea of well, it seems this way, but it
[3:05] doesn't seem that can be and this
[3:06] dissonance sometimes is just this
[3:08] discomfort from two different ideas that
[3:10] seem to oppose one another.
[3:13] In Genesis 24:es 1 to9, we see that
[3:17] Abraham, as I mentioned before, is
[3:19] composing his will. He's laying out this
[3:21] great plan that he has for his son
[3:23] Isaac. And he empowers Eleazar to carry
[3:26] it out. So he has a vision, he has a
[3:27] plan, and now he's tasked one who's
[3:30] familiar with this plan to go out and to
[3:32] conduct this plan so that there can be a
[3:35] bride for his son. In Genesis 24:5, it
[3:39] says, "And the servant said unto him,
[3:41] per adventure, the woman will not be
[3:43] willing to follow me unto this land." So
[3:46] the question is, well, what if the woman
[3:48] does not follow? your goal and your
[3:50] vision is that I would go and find a
[3:52] wife for your son in this land that you
[3:54] had come out of and that God had called
[3:56] you out of and if I find one of this
[3:59] family and I say well my master wants uh
[4:02] you to come and marry his son what if
[4:04] she doesn't go and with that question in
[4:06] mind of well if the if you can't get a
[4:08] bride for my son out of uh Calald out of
[4:12] Babylon should I bring my son must I
[4:15] needs bring thy son again unto the land
[4:17] from whence thou camest So then the
[4:20] question is if I can't get her to come,
[4:23] can I get can your son return and go
[4:26] back to Babylon uh and physically appear
[4:30] there in in Babylon and Calaldia for the
[4:32] sake of getting the son? Now it's
[4:34] important to remember this question that
[4:36] Eleazar has in the beginning and Abraham
[4:38] objects very quickly. Beware that thou
[4:41] bring not my son thither again. So the
[4:45] question is would the woman follow?
[4:46] Abraham could all sort all sorts of
[4:48] visions and ideas and wants for his son.
[4:51] But the woman still had to make a choice
[4:53] as Ezar believes. And if not, should the
[4:56] son go and go to Caldia or Babylon? I
[5:01] keep want to say Leodysia. So you could
[5:02] just maybe look at that type there.
[5:04] Should my son go a and make his
[5:06] appearance there to woo the woman a and
[5:09] to convince her to marry him?
[5:11] And this job of Ezer to go into Calaldia
[5:15] and then begin to speak to people who uh
[5:17] believe differently and but yet there
[5:19] may be some relationship there and just
[5:21] all those questions that might be
[5:22] resolved or challenged or issued. It's
[5:25] it really speaks to the demand of
[5:26] Christianity or the very question that
[5:29] Jesus has when he comes to Israel.
[5:32] They're in this very dark time in their
[5:34] day. And here he says, "I am sent from
[5:36] the father. Follow me." John 21:22 Jesus
[5:40] saith unto him if I tar if I will that
[5:44] he tried till I come. This is Peter
[5:46] saying, "Well, I see what you want from
[5:47] me, but what about this guy over here?"
[5:49] He says, "What is that to thee? Follow
[5:51] thou me."
[5:53] Doesn't matter what anybody else is
[5:55] doing. Well, what about this person?
[5:56] What about that person? His saying to
[5:58] Peter is follow me no matter what anyone
[6:00] else is doing. And we know that Christ
[6:03] is the word sent by the father to
[6:05] disclose the will of the father to even
[6:08] interpret and make plain the plan of God
[6:10] through the Old Testament. And so,
[6:12] Christianity is following Christ. You
[6:15] cannot claim to be a Christian and not
[6:17] follow Christ.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 16 24, then Jesus said to his
[6:22] disciples, "If any man will come after
[6:24] me, let him deny himself." And so
[6:26] there's this element of self-denial and
[6:28] take up his cross and follow me. This is
[6:34] the call to every single Christian. So
[6:36] does that mean I have to hear Jesus of
[6:38] Nazareth call my name? Do I need to have
[6:40] a similar experience as the disciples
[6:42] did who are about doing their job and
[6:44] then a man standing there says follow me
[6:46] and I'll make you fishers of men. No,
[6:48] it's not the same physically. It's not
[6:50] the same in reality as far as the the
[6:53] carnal performance of it. But still yet
[6:56] God calls to his seed follow me.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; Now what does this leading look like? Is
[7:01] there's a it's implied if you're
[7:03] following then there's something that's
[7:05] leading. And uh don't fool yourself.
[7:07] Somebody's leading you. something is
[7:09] leading you.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; Uh uh you're following something or
[7:12] someone or you may be leading somebody
[7:15] else because everyone looks to us as an
[7:16] example and and somebody may be
[7:19] following you.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; John chapter 16 verse 13 it says how be
[7:23] it when he the spirit of truth has come.
[7:26] He will guide you into all truth.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; So here is that leadership now not not
[7:32] Jesus of Nazareth as he leads the
[7:34] disciples. He tell them I'm going to go
[7:35] away. It's expedient that I go away. I'm
[7:38] going to go away. But then there's going
[7:40] to be another one come who is the spirit
[7:41] of truth sent of the father which is God
[7:44] himself in the form of the Holy Spirit
[7:47] who is going to guide you or lead you in
[7:50] all truth into all truth. For he will
[7:53] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[7:55] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[7:57] will show you things to come.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; These are this is a scriptural
[8:01] description of what it would be like to
[8:03] be Peter in that instance. He say, "What
[8:05] is that to thee? If he tarot till I
[8:07] come, follow me." And how is he going to
[8:09] be led? By the spirit of truth. So
[8:12] following requires a guide.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Following requires leadership. If
[8:18] someone says, "Well, I'm going on a a
[8:20] guided hunt or I'm going on a guided
[8:22] fishing trip." That implies that they
[8:24] have somebody there who may be an expert
[8:26] or knowledgeable in the area, maybe even
[8:28] licensed, and they're going to be the
[8:29] ones that are leading the trip.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going on an a guided hunt. Oh,
[8:34] well, who's your guide? Well, me. I'm
[8:35] the guide. He said, well, that's kind of
[8:36] a weird way of weird way of thinking of
[8:39] it. It'd be kind of like, you know,
[8:40] anybody who represents themselves in the
[8:42] court of law has a fool for a client.
[8:44] And if you you might just be that guy
[8:46] who's not going to fill your tag if you
[8:49] think you're the guide and you don't
[8:50] have the knowledge or expertise because
[8:52] really you don't guide yourself in that
[8:54] sense. You would just be hunting.
[8:57] in Genesis 24:7.
[9:01] Now, this is Abraham's continued
[9:03] response to this question of,"Well, what
[9:05] if the woman doesn't follow me? The Lord
[9:07] God of heaven, which took me from my
[9:09] father's house." So, now that there's
[9:10] this precedent, God led me from my
[9:12] father's house and from the land of my
[9:14] kindred kindred, which he spake unto me,
[9:16] and that swear unto me, saying, "Unto
[9:18] thy seed will I give this land. He shall
[9:21] send his angel before thee." Abraham's
[9:24] speaking from experience. He's saying, I
[9:26] was just there. I was a heathen. I was
[9:28] an idol worshipper. And God dealt with
[9:30] my heart and called me. And there's been
[9:31] this leadership of the Lord in my life
[9:33] to where I am now. So the same God that
[9:35] has led me, I believe that he will send
[9:36] his angel before you. And thou shalt
[9:38] take a wife unto my son from then.
[9:41] That's that's some pretty confident
[9:42] language. God will guide you to that
[9:45] woman and she is going to be led or she
[9:48] going to take my wife from there. Then
[9:50] he says, "But if the willing will the
[9:52] woman will not be willing to follow you,
[9:54] then thou shalt be clear from my oath
[9:57] only bring not my son thither again."
[9:59] Abraham acknowledging that the woman
[10:01] does have ultimately some say in the
[10:03] matter or the family has some say in the
[10:05] matter. So this is what you must do.
[10:07] Follow the angel that is leading you.
[10:10] And if you don't get the response that
[10:12] the woman doesn't answer the way that we
[10:14] want her to, you have to just do what
[10:17] you're supposed to do and you'll be
[10:19] absolved. You'll be clear. And the woman
[10:22] makes her choice. The family makes their
[10:24] choice.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; But you cannot bring my son back to
[10:29] Babylon to Calaldia because that's not
[10:30] my plan.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the servant put his
[10:35] hand under the thigh of Abraham his
[10:36] master and swear to him concerning the
[10:38] matter." So the angel in this instance
[10:41] is God's conductor. It's Abraham's uh
[10:45] God's conductor to Abraham's conductor,
[10:48] Eleazar.
[10:50] God is going to lead and to guide this
[10:52] angel. So as we asked Wednesday night,
[10:54] what does leading look like?
[10:57] Abraham isn't just sending the angel of
[10:59] the Lord into Babylon. A a and the woman
[11:02] there wakes up one day in Babylon says,
[11:04] "I must needs go on a road trip." Right?
[11:07] and just all of a sudden is just kind of
[11:09] animated and just floats on a a magic
[11:11] carpet ride down into where Isaac is and
[11:14] they have a chance meeting or she
[11:16] doesn't sign up for Tinder or whatever
[11:18] else means we might think works today.
[11:20] But he is what is leading going to look
[11:23] like and this this leadership I'm
[11:24] wanting to use as an example in Genesis
[11:26] Genesis 24 or even following presents
[11:29] the uh the great difficulty of Christ's
[11:33] call to follow me.
[11:35] Now, if we knew right now that Jesus
[11:37] Christ himself was going to walk through
[11:38] those doors and say, "Come follow me."
[11:40] None of it would none of us would ask,
[11:41] "Where are you going?"
[11:43] &gt;&gt; We would just follow him because we'd
[11:45] have this context, this history, and
[11:46] this is Jesus Christ. Let's follow him.
[11:49] But yet, Christ comes into an atmosphere
[11:52] and says, "Follow me as a as a as one
[11:55] who has represent himself to be a
[11:56] teacher, a master. Follow me."
[12:00] So, there there's one that you follow.
[12:02] But this concept of leadership is so
[12:04] important especially in the New
[12:06] Testament to Christianity or to our
[12:08] identity as children of God. In Romans
[12:11] chapter 8:14, for as many as are led by
[12:13] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[12:16] God.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; This is a principle that I think every
[12:19] child of God should hold very dear to.
[12:22] God's children are led by God's spirit.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; I thought I woke up in Phoenix. I think
[12:28] I woke up in Phoenix, but I feel like I
[12:29] traveled to one of the poles, the south.
[12:31] It's freezing cold in here. Anybody else
[12:33] cold?
[12:35] That I'm the only one. Okay, I'll put my
[12:37] axe up. It's not quite time to go
[12:39] slaughter hogs. Feels like winter in
[12:42] here.
[12:44] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[12:46] God, they are the sons of God. So, this
[12:50] leadership is critical to our identity
[12:52] as Christians.
[12:54] And when God when Abraham sends Eleazar
[12:57] and God is going to send his angel
[12:59] before Eleazar and we're using Eleazar
[13:02] as the one that we believe to be this
[13:04] most trusted servant of Abraham. God's
[13:07] angel is not the one the woman would
[13:09] see.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; If the woman went out to draw water and
[13:13] she knew as a for absolute fact this is
[13:16] the angel Lord and he said I want you to
[13:18] go down into a strange land because I
[13:20] have a husband waiting for you. Then
[13:22] there that would be more that would be
[13:24] this level of oh my goodness this is
[13:26] real. What can I do? It put it in a
[13:27] different plane. But the woman would not
[13:30] see God's angel or hear God's angel. It
[13:32] would be Eleaser that she would see and
[13:34] hear. And it would be Ezer that she
[13:36] would have to follow on the basis of his
[13:39] word and the gifts that he provides
[13:41] &gt;&gt; to back up what his promise was.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; The problem isn't so much well that's
[13:49] what it is and that's what it is. But
[13:50] notice what the Bible has to say about
[13:53] uh man in Psalms 118:es 8 and N. It is
[13:57] better to trust in the Lord than to put
[13:58] confidence in man.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; And all the women said
[14:03] it's better to put trust Can we back up?
[14:07] It's better to put your trust in the
[14:08] Lord than it is to put your confidence
[14:10] in human. Right?
[14:12] &gt;&gt; And we would all agree it is better that
[14:13] I trust in God than to put my trust in
[14:16] man. And then he says, "It is better to
[14:18] trust the Lord than to put confidence in
[14:20] princes." In other words, it's better to
[14:22] trust God than to trust another person.
[14:25] And it's better to trust a God, trust a
[14:27] God than it is to trust another person
[14:28] that may seem to be more trustworthy or
[14:30] more powerful or more resourceful.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible says it's better to trust the
[14:36] Lord
[14:37] &gt;&gt; and not to trust man or put confidence
[14:40] in power.
[14:41] Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3 21,
[14:43] "Therefore, let no man glory in men."
[14:47] There is a a qu a challenge then of
[14:50] putting glory in man, relying too much
[14:53] upon the flesh in 1 Corinthians chapter
[14:56] 3:es 3 and 4. So just before this, the
[15:00] the the statement therefore let no man
[15:01] glory in men is kind of answering to
[15:03] this problem he begins to address
[15:05] earlier. For ye are yet carnal. Why are
[15:07] they carnal? For as there is among you
[15:09] envion and strife and divisions, are you
[15:12] not carnal and walk as men? For while
[15:15] one saith, I am of a Paul and another, I
[15:17] am of Apollos, are you not carnal?
[15:20] Notice how they identified themselves
[15:22] with the man Apollos taught me this.
[15:25] Paul taught me this. I was taught this
[15:27] and this is the one that teaches me
[15:28] this. This is the one I'm following.
[15:30] This is the one that's leading me. He
[15:32] says, "You're carnal when you associate
[15:34] yourself with or glory in the man. when
[15:37] you're so so clearly identified with
[15:40] that division and that distinction. He
[15:41] says there's a carnality to it. He says,
[15:42] "Well, I was baptized by this one and I
[15:45] was baptized by that one and I go to
[15:46] this person's church and I go to that
[15:48] person's church." So, there's a lot that
[15:49] we can begin to glean from both Old
[15:51] Testament and New Testament that kind of
[15:52] say, well, uh I don't know how can I
[15:56] follow and I don't want to be guilty of
[15:58] following a man or putting my trust in a
[16:00] man.
[16:02] Paul said in Ephesians 5:1, "Be
[16:04] therefore followers of God as dear
[16:07] children,
[16:08] &gt;&gt; imitators, pursuing after following God
[16:11] as his own children." Well, that's that
[16:13] should be easier than it would be to
[16:16] follow, you know, a stranger or some
[16:18] other man because the children of God
[16:20] are led by the spirit of God. So, if you
[16:22] were a child of God, you're being led by
[16:23] the spirit of God and that should be
[16:25] leading you to follow God. We said
[16:27] that's the dynamic. That's what we
[16:28] believe in. Right.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; And so Genesis chapter 24 presents a
[16:33] difficult situation
[16:36] that is analogous to what we face even
[16:38] in following Christ.
[16:41] We say well this woman and if we look at
[16:43] it in the context of uh tradition and
[16:47] culture and during that time there's a
[16:48] lot of things that were done differently
[16:50] than we do them today. But yet still
[16:53] this is a challenge. A strange man is
[16:55] going to show up and ask you to marry
[16:57] his servant's son. All these different
[16:59] degrees of separation. Is my is my
[17:02] future husband your master? No, his
[17:04] dad's my master. It's all right. So,
[17:06] what's let me get this straight. This is
[17:08] the question that's be going to be
[17:09] posed.
[17:12] And then in Jeremiah 10:23, oh Lord, I
[17:14] know that the way of man is not in
[17:16] himself. It is not in man that walketh
[17:19] to direct his steps.
[17:22] We should not put confidence in man or
[17:25] in princes. We're carnal when we glory
[17:28] in men.
[17:31] And then we ourselves do not know within
[17:34] ourselves the way to take.
[17:37] All right. No, I'm not going to trust
[17:38] anybody else. I I got to go on my own.
[17:41] And Paul even said, we put no confidence
[17:43] in the flesh, his own flesh. So there is
[17:46] this drilling down to where I I it's
[17:50] better to trust in the Lord than to
[17:51] trust in you. And I can't even trust in
[17:53] myself because this deceitful heart will
[17:55] lead me astray. And the man it's not
[17:57] within himself to know his way. It's not
[17:59] in him to direct his steps.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; So if I can say this in uh to the point
[18:05] if you do not know Christ, you cannot
[18:07] follow Christ.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; And you cannot I mean following the
[18:12] spirit is much harder when you don't
[18:14] have it.
[18:15] There's a way that you're kind of trying
[18:16] to read the tea tea leaves a little bit
[18:18] and go, "Oh, they're doing this. They're
[18:19] doing that." You kind of follow the
[18:20] crowds and you do what other people are
[18:21] doing. And there could be a way where
[18:23] you're changing the s you're chasing the
[18:25] signs of his presence. And so you might
[18:27] you might seem to be in the right
[18:29] direction and are in the right place at
[18:30] the right time every so often. But if
[18:32] you do not have the Holy Spirit, you are
[18:34] not internally following the spirit of
[18:37] truth that Christ promised to come and
[18:39] lead you and guide you into all truth.
[18:42] Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; So if you do not know Christ, you cannot
[18:46] follow him. You say, "Well, then how can
[18:47] I ever follow him?" Well, there has to
[18:50] be an introduction to him.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; And a choice to follow him
[18:56] &gt;&gt; and through that new birth have the
[18:57] spirit that would lead you after him.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; John chapter 6 29, I think it's
[19:03] expressed this way when they said,
[19:05] "Well, what can we do to work the mighty
[19:07] works of God?" Jesus said, "This is the
[19:09] work of God that you believe on him whom
[19:11] he hath sent."
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Look at that twofold. In other words, I
[19:14] want to work the works of God. Well, the
[19:16] greatest work, your magnum opus, what
[19:18] the best thing you can do is to believe
[19:21] in him.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Have faith.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; And look at it in this sense that that
[19:26] is the work of God.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; When you have faith in him, God has
[19:31] wrought that or produced that. So the
[19:34] greatest works is the greatest work uh
[19:36] uh healing is the greatest work
[19:37] salvation is the greatest work to create
[19:39] is the greatest work to raise the dead
[19:41] you can say those are all great works
[19:43] but they all begin in faith
[19:46] &gt;&gt; that that's the initial work of God upon
[19:50] which everything else is founded
[19:54] &gt;&gt; so we see this
[19:56] demand of Christianity follow me follow
[19:58] Christ must follow the leadership of the
[20:00] Holy Spirit in Genesis chapter 24 The
[20:03] angel Lord is going to go before
[20:04] Eleazar, but it's going to be Eleazar,
[20:06] the earthly servant that's going to
[20:07] stand there before a woman and say,
[20:10] "Will you marry my servant's son?"
[20:14] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 21 32-36, I just want you to
[20:18] see just how difficult it is for man to
[20:20] accept the ones that God sends. And John
[20:23] came unto you in the way of
[20:24] righteousness, and you believed him not.
[20:26] So even though he was in the spirit of
[20:29] Elijah, a forerunner, they did not
[20:31] believe him. But the publicans and the
[20:33] harlots believed him, the ones you
[20:35] wouldn't think would believe him. And
[20:36] ye, when you had seen it, repented not
[20:38] afterward that you might believe him. So
[20:42] they didn't receive him. Others did, but
[20:44] they still didn't change even after the
[20:46] other's faith. So he says here another
[20:47] parable. And he's expounding upon this.
[20:50] They rejected the prophet that God had
[20:51] sent. There was a certain householder
[20:53] who planted a vineyard and hedged it
[20:55] round about and digged a wine press in
[20:58] it and built a tower and led it out to
[21:01] husbandmen. So now he owns the land, he
[21:04] prepares it, leaves it to husbandmen and
[21:07] went into a far country. And when the
[21:09] time of the fruit drew near, he sent his
[21:12] servants to the husbandmen that they
[21:14] might receive the fruits of it. So he
[21:17] has placed husbandmen in care over his
[21:20] estate and then the owner sends a
[21:23] servant to collect what he's due. I want
[21:26] the fruits of this vineyard. I I want to
[21:27] enjoy the fruits of this harvest. And it
[21:30] says the men that were there in that
[21:32] country tending his fields took his
[21:36] servants and beat one and killed another
[21:38] and stoned another.
[21:41] Again he sent other servants more than
[21:43] the first and they did unto them
[21:44] likewise. This is there is left a a
[21:49] responsibility over something
[21:53] and whenever the one who owns it sends a
[21:55] servant to collect what they're due they
[21:57] beat they they beat the servant he sends
[22:00] more they beat that servant
[22:03] and then in doing so
[22:06] they are they are rejecting the one who
[22:11] owns that the one who's given them that
[22:13] responsibility the one that he sends and
[22:14] Jesus hear the parable. This is what you
[22:16] did to John.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; And he continues even so goes so far as
[22:20] to say that his uh they he sends his son
[22:24] and what do they do to him?
[22:27] &gt;&gt; So there's the wisdom even in that if
[22:28] they won't if they won't receive the
[22:30] servants, if they won't receive his
[22:31] prophets, they're not going to receive
[22:33] him or even his son.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; It's remarkable just how quickly I moved
[22:38] back into Phoenix. It's starting to get
[22:40] warm.
[22:41] I'm schizophrenic up here uh as far as
[22:43] the temperature. So just you guys do
[22:45] what you need to do and we'll be fine.
[22:48] Luke 13:34, he says it a little bit more
[22:51] plainly. Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which
[22:53] killth klest the prophets and stoneest
[22:55] them that are sent unto thee. This is
[22:58] what they do. They kill the prophets.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; The parable is about Israel
[23:02] &gt;&gt; who believed in God, but the very ones
[23:04] who were servants of God and spoke on
[23:06] God's behalf. They're killing them and
[23:08] stoning them and rejecting them.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; And this is what they asked for too.
[23:12] God, you don't speak to us. have Moses
[23:14] speak to us. So God establishes there in
[23:17] Deuteronomy the order of prophets. Okay,
[23:19] I won't speak to you. I will use
[23:20] prophets to speak to you. But then this
[23:22] is the nature of man that when God
[23:24] actually sends a prophet to speak to
[23:26] them, they find reason to stone him and
[23:28] reject him.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; It's almost as if they don't want what
[23:31] they asked for.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; So well God, you just speak to us. You
[23:35] just deal with me in my heart. You just
[23:38] lead me internally. I'll just follow my
[23:41] instinct and my gut.
[23:45] So there's the pattern that we see even
[23:47] in Israel that they reject the servants.
[23:50] If we're to be forwardlooking, if we
[23:52] were to read these scriptures and we see
[23:54] how Israel and mankind had behaved for
[23:56] these thousands of years and now Abraham
[23:58] is going to send Eleazar into a strange
[24:00] land as a servant to get a bride for his
[24:02] son, we say he's going to have problems
[24:06] because man, if man will can reject even
[24:09] those who have authority from a
[24:11] sovereign or from the owner.
[24:14] And the hardest thing that God has ever
[24:16] had to do is to get one mortal to
[24:17] believe another.
[24:19] There's a lot of hard things that we
[24:21] could say, but it's one of the hardest
[24:23] things that God has ever had to do. It's
[24:25] one of the most difficult things for you
[24:27] to do is to believe another mortal.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; But yet, that's the way that God has
[24:35] play laid this out. God has chosen man
[24:37] to be his conductor.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; He may have composed it, but man has
[24:41] conducted it. He has designed it that
[24:44] spiritled men represent him.
[24:48] And if that is true in this sense, we
[24:51] are either following God because we're
[24:53] led
[24:55] &gt;&gt; or we we're following ourselves and
[24:58] we're blind.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Or we're following someone else who is
[25:02] blind.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; If this is oversimplistic, I'm sure we
[25:06] can thresh this out a little bit more in
[25:07] one of our breakout sessions. But you're
[25:09] either led by God,
[25:11] &gt;&gt; right? who go and and understanding how
[25:14] God leads
[25:16] &gt;&gt; or you're leading yourself in which case
[25:18] you're without God's leadership
[25:20] therefore you're blind
[25:21] &gt;&gt; or you're following somebody else who in
[25:24] fact is not led by God because otherwise
[25:26] if you being led by God maybe there is
[25:28] someone else leading
[25:31] but in fact if they're blind then it's
[25:33] exactly what Jesus said
[25:35] &gt;&gt; lead them alone if the blind lead the
[25:37] blind they're all going to end up in the
[25:39] ditch Without
[25:41] Holy Ghost leadership, you are blind.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Even if you're following the right one,
[25:46] you're still blind.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; And if you if you have the Holy Ghost,
[25:51] then you can be led and be following
[25:53] God.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; So in Genesis chapter 24, Eleazar is
[25:58] being sent by Abraham. But the question
[26:00] is, why would the woman follow a man?
[26:04] I want to use Acts chapter 8 verses
[26:06] 26-39.
[26:08] And as we look at this story, as we walk
[26:11] through this, I think we can get through
[26:12] it rather quickly.
[26:14] This in the New Testament church, the
[26:16] angel Lord spake unto Philillip, saying,
[26:19] "Arise and go toward the south, unto the
[26:21] way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto
[26:23] Gaza," which is the desert. Philip is
[26:25] being led by the Lord. And he's now
[26:27] following that leading into the desert.
[26:29] He speaks to him, "Arise and go. Arise
[26:32] and go and go into the desert." And so
[26:34] the Bible says in verse 27, he arose and
[26:37] went. This is the leadership of the Holy
[26:39] Spirit.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord is Abraham said,
[26:42] "The angel of the Lord's going to go
[26:42] before you, Eleazar, and he's going to
[26:44] make your way prosperous." Now, Philip
[26:46] is told by the angel of the Lord, "Arise
[26:48] and go into the desert." He arose and
[26:49] went and behold a man of the Ethiopia, a
[26:51] unic of great authority under Candace, a
[26:54] queen of the Ethiopians, who had the
[26:55] charge of all her treasure. This is a
[26:57] very powerful man. and had come to
[27:00] Jerusalem for to worship
[27:03] was returning and sitting in his chariot
[27:06] read Isaiah the prophet. Now
[27:10] as we look at this example of Philillip
[27:11] and now this example of this Ethiopian
[27:15] unic I want you to catch that this unic
[27:17] is obediently worshiping God.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; He had gone to Jerusalem. He went to
[27:23] church. He went to worship as they would
[27:25] be required to. And now he's reading the
[27:29] book of Isaiah, the scrolls, and he he's
[27:32] seeking truth and wisdom. So he's he's
[27:34] going to church. He's reading his Bible.
[27:36] He's he's obediently worshiping God. And
[27:38] now, see, a stranger shows up who's been
[27:42] sent by the Holy Spirit. He sees this
[27:44] Ethiopian. The spirit says unto Philip
[27:46] in verse 29, "Go near and join thyself
[27:48] to his chariot."
[27:50] Not sure just exactly how these
[27:51] logistics work, but now Philip is there
[27:53] at the chariot. and he runs thither to
[27:56] him and heard him read the prophet
[27:58] Isaiah. And so he's reading out loud
[28:01] and Philip asked, "Do you understand
[28:03] what you're reading?"
[28:05] So in this in this uh scene, Philillip
[28:08] is following the leadership of the Holy
[28:11] Spirit and he asks the Ethiopian, "Do
[28:12] you understand the the prophet?" Now
[28:15] catch the humilian wisdom of this
[28:17] Ethiopian unic, the wisdom of this
[28:19] answer. And the unic says in verse 31,
[28:22] "How can I understand what I'm reading
[28:25] unless some man should teach me?
[28:29] &gt;&gt; How can I know what Isaiah is saying
[28:31] unless I am taught or someone give me
[28:33] understanding? How can I accept some man
[28:35] should guide me?" And he desired
[28:37] Philillip that he would come up and sit
[28:39] with him.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; The Ethiopian has acknowledged that he
[28:43] may need a man to lead him to say guide
[28:46] him means to give guidance to or to
[28:47] teach. I I need someone to lead me
[28:49] because I I I I'm a little bit uh
[28:52] hesitant to trust myself and I don't
[28:54] want to just interpret these things and
[28:55] how can I accept I be guided in these
[28:58] things and he wanted Philip maybe we can
[29:00] fellowship on this. It says in verse 32,
[29:03] the place of the scripture which he read
[29:04] was this. He was led as a sheep to the
[29:07] slaughter and like a lamb dumb before
[29:09] his shear so open he not his mouth. What
[29:11] a place to be reading. In his
[29:13] humiliation, his judgment was taken
[29:15] away. And who shall declare his
[29:16] generation? For his life is taken from
[29:18] the earth. We know he's reading prophecy
[29:22] of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the son of
[29:24] God.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; The prophecy that the Messiah would give
[29:27] his life, that he would shed his blood,
[29:29] that he would be the lamb slain. And so
[29:31] the unic answers and ask Philip this
[29:33] question in verse 34. I pray thee, of
[29:36] whom speaks the prophet? Does he speak
[29:38] of himself or some other man?
[29:42] Is Isaiah the one who's like a lamb dumb
[29:44] before his shears? Is Isaiah the one
[29:46] who's going to be slaughtered and taken
[29:48] from the earth? Or is he prophesying or
[29:50] speaking of somebody else?
[29:55] With the understanding at the minimum, I
[29:58] can say this. He he seeks after wisdom.
[30:01] He's he wants to uh know truth and seek
[30:04] wisdom and in all his getting get
[30:06] understanding.
[30:08] And so with this knowledge that he needs
[30:09] to be led, he's asking a question to be
[30:12] taught.
[30:14] Does he speak of himself or does he
[30:16] speak of another? Verse 35. Then Philip
[30:18] opened his mouth
[30:20] and began and maybe he opened his mouth
[30:23] at first like
[30:26] wow.
[30:28] God leads me here.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Can you believe it? What a coincidence,
[30:32] right? his mouth. He opens his mouth and
[30:35] began at the same scripture and preached
[30:37] unto him Jesus.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Now, what he had to preach to him is
[30:41] what the present truth
[30:43] &gt;&gt; he had to preach to them. Isaiah was
[30:45] actually speaking of I don't know if
[30:46] you've heard of him, but it was a man
[30:47] named Jesus of Nazareth. He performed a
[30:49] lot of miracles recently and was doing
[30:51] these different things. And that's the
[30:52] one that he spoke of and him the the
[30:55] Romans crucified at the direction of the
[30:57] hands of the Jews as the Bible said. And
[30:59] he begins to use the Bible to preach
[31:01] unto him Jesus. And as he's preaching to
[31:03] him, Jesus noticed what the progress
[31:04] they make. And as they went on their
[31:06] way, they came under a certain water.
[31:08] And the unic said, "See, here is water.
[31:10] What do hinder me to be baptized?" He
[31:13] had preached to him the gospel.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; And Jesus commanded that we go into all
[31:17] the world and preach the gospel and
[31:19] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:20] Christ. And he that believeth and is
[31:22] baptized shall be saved. And the unic is
[31:24] picking up what's being laid down. He
[31:25] says, "Here's water.
[31:28] what hinders me from being immersed
[31:29] immediately in water in the name of
[31:32] Jesus Christ.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; So he's he's he's hearing the word
[31:37] taught by uh Philillip on the from the
[31:40] scripture and he understands and he
[31:42] believes
[31:44] &gt;&gt; and Philip says if thou believest with
[31:46] all thine heart thou mayest. So he wants
[31:47] to challenge him.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; You've got to believe with all your
[31:50] heart because the Bible says, "He who
[31:51] seeks me with his whole heart will find
[31:53] me." And he answers says, "I believe
[31:55] that Jesus Christ is the son of God."
[31:59] &gt;&gt; What a declaration.
[32:02] this uh unic from Ethiopia, very
[32:05] powerful man, a trusted man who is uh
[32:09] worshiping at Jerusalem and reading the
[32:11] Bible with all sincerity has a servant
[32:14] of God led of the spirit to teach to him
[32:16] Jesus Christ from the scripture says I
[32:18] believe that Jesus Christ is the son of
[32:21] God.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; And he commanded the chariot to stand
[32:24] still and they went both down both into
[32:27] the water. This is how you're baptized,
[32:29] not by sprinkling,
[32:30] &gt;&gt; by immersion. And they went down into
[32:32] the water, both Philip and the unic, and
[32:34] he baptized him. He immersed him. And
[32:37] when they came up out of the water, this
[32:38] isn't sprinkling.
[32:41] He says, "The spirit of the Lord caught
[32:42] away Philillip that the Unix saw him no
[32:45] more, and he went on his way rejoicing.
[32:49] Now the unit could be led." Right.
[32:52] Right.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Even there's a lot of I don't know if
[32:54] they're the Coptic Christians, but
[32:56] there's even Christians in Ethiopia that
[32:59] they they can trace back to this time
[33:01] when the gospel went back to Ethiopia.
[33:05] Philip himself had been called by Christ
[33:08] in John chapter 1. Follow me.
[33:12] Now Philip is being led by Christ into
[33:15] the wilderness into the desert to
[33:18] introduce that same Christ to a unic.
[33:21] Though he doesn't see Jesus of Nazareth,
[33:22] he's going to make the introduction.
[33:25] In John 1:43 to50, the day following
[33:27] Jesus would go forth into Galilee and
[33:28] findeth Philip and say unto him, "Follow
[33:30] me." And Philip was of Bethaya to the
[33:32] city of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth
[33:35] Nathaniel, and said unto him, we found
[33:36] him of whom Moses in the law, and the
[33:38] prophets did right, Jesus of Nazareth,
[33:40] the son of Joseph. And Nathaniel said
[33:42] unto him, "Can there can there any good
[33:44] thing come out of Nazareth?" And Philip
[33:46] saith unto him, "Come and see."
[33:49] Philip had followed Christ,
[33:52] was convinced of who he was. And so then
[33:54] he says, "Come and see this Christ. Come
[33:55] and see this one."
[33:58] Now, I believe had Christ been
[33:59] physically present on the earth during
[34:01] that day, perhaps he would have told the
[34:02] Ethiopian, "I got here pretty fast and I
[34:04] know one that can get us out of here
[34:06] pretty fast. If you want to go see him,
[34:07] he's on the shores of Galilee right now.
[34:10] Take your chariot and go turn. You must
[34:11] go to him. Come and see." But instead he
[34:13] preaches to him Christ from the
[34:16] scripture. The demand of Christ to
[34:17] repent and be baptized.
[34:21] And now Philip can be led.
[34:24] And this is God's works. It's he that
[34:27] works in you both to believe and to do.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; His work is that you believe him unseen
[34:36] by the human eye.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; But you believe him by the words of his
[34:40] servants. Amen.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; There's a God that loves you. Well, I
[34:44] want him to tell me himself. And then
[34:46] that you could just show the ways that
[34:47] he told you already that he loves you.
[34:48] Well, I just want him to do this in the
[34:50] sky and I want him to do this and I want
[34:51] a demand of heaven. That it's the
[34:53] attitude they had toward the Messiah. If
[34:54] you be the Messiah, come off the cross.
[34:56] If you be the Messiah, tell me who hit
[34:58] you.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; And there's a way that we might seem to
[35:00] be sincere, but we're actually asking
[35:01] God to clown for us and to bypass his
[35:04] pattern that this is the will of God
[35:06] that you believe on him whom he hath
[35:07] sent.
[35:08] It is impossible to please God without
[35:10] faith. He wants you to believe.
[35:12] Gentiles, trust me on this. This is
[35:14] scriptural. This is Bible. He wants you
[35:16] to believe in a greater way than even he
[35:18] expected of the Jews to believe in a
[35:21] Christ that you can't physically touch
[35:23] or see.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; But you take him at his word.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 6 10 to12. For God is
[35:32] not unrighteousness righteous to forget
[35:35] your work and labor of love which you
[35:37] have showed towards his name and that
[35:39] you have ministered to the saints and do
[35:41] minister a lot there to process
[35:43] beautiful things. But then he says and
[35:45] we desire that every one of you do show
[35:47] the same diligence to the full assurance
[35:48] of hope unto the end. That foundation I
[35:51] think is critical to what he says next
[35:53] because these are labors. These are
[35:54] servants. They're giving. But then he
[35:56] says that you be not slothful but
[35:58] followers of them who through faith and
[36:01] patience inherit the promises.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Don't be slothful.
[36:06] Don't be dilatory. Don't get lazy. But
[36:08] follow those who through faith and
[36:10] patience inherit the process. The
[36:12] promises.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Look at the example and follow others
[36:16] who are obtaining God's blessings,
[36:19] &gt;&gt; doing God's work. So though they
[36:22] ministered and labored, he's now saying,
[36:24] and it might seem to make us a little
[36:25] uneasy because we have all these I don't
[36:26] want to glory in man and I don't want to
[36:28] do this and I don't want to do that. But
[36:29] now he's saying follow those who through
[36:30] faith and patience inherit the proc
[36:32] promises. That's an important thing.
[36:34] Faith and patience is perseverance.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; We were cautioned earlier don't glory in
[36:39] men because one says I am of Paul and I
[36:40] am of Apollos. But Paul clarifies in
[36:42] verse 5 1 Corinthians chapter 3 5-6. Who
[36:45] then is Paul and who is Apollos? Right?
[36:47] Who is pastor? What is a pastor? Who is
[36:50] Paul? Who is Apollos? But ministers by
[36:53] whom you believed,
[36:55] &gt;&gt; even as the Lord gave to every man.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; It reads almost to say that God has
[37:01] given gifts to men.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; That by those gifts, you would believe.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Who is Paul? He's a minister from God
[37:10] through which you believed in Christ.
[37:12] Who is Apollos? A minister of God
[37:14] through which you believed in Christ.
[37:16] And Paul says, "I have planted, Apollos
[37:18] watered, but God gave the increase."
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Notice that God's divine plan uses human
[37:24] initiative.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Your work and labor of love, your
[37:27] diligence in ministering.
[37:30] God uses human initiative.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Paul plants, Apollos waters, but it's
[37:34] God that gives the increase.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Do we want to just sit back, I'll do all
[37:38] the planting, I'll do all the watering?
[37:40] Well, if that's the case, is God going
[37:42] to give the increase?
[37:43] You're just going to be your own little
[37:45] pot.
[37:46] What soil are you in? I I made it
[37:48] myself.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; What seed is that? I made it myself.
[37:52] But he says, "Who's Paul and who's
[37:53] Apollos?" He when he says, "Thou shalt
[37:55] not glory in men." And he says, "They're
[37:56] carnal because I'm of Paul and I'm of
[37:58] Apollos." He's saying, "You've forgotten
[38:00] who they were. They were ministers
[38:03] through whom you believed in the Lord
[38:06] &gt;&gt; because God gave you that ministry to
[38:09] believe in him." Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; One can plant another waters, but it's
[38:15] all God.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; It's up to God in the end to give the
[38:18] increase.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians chapter 1:es 5-7,
[38:23] for our gospel came not unto you in the
[38:24] word, in word only, but also in power
[38:26] and in the demonstration,
[38:28] excuse me, in power and in the Holy
[38:30] Ghost. In Corinthians, he uses a a
[38:32] phrase of demonstration and in much
[38:33] assurance as you know what manner of men
[38:36] we were among you for your sake. So even
[38:38] the assurance is in the manner of man
[38:40] that he was. His testimony is an
[38:41] example. So he says in verse six, I hope
[38:43] you're all ready for this because I read
[38:45] some things earlier that said one thing,
[38:46] but now he says, "And ye became
[38:49] followers of us." And it's at that
[38:51] moment we all shut our Bibles and said,
[38:53] "No, can't believe it. No, no way. I
[38:56] need to find a Bible that leaves Paul
[38:57] out of this." Because he said they
[38:59] became followers of him and the Lord,
[39:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Having received the word in much
[39:04] affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost.
[39:06] Notice just how much is in this phrase.
[39:10] You became followers of me and the Lord
[39:13] because you received the word with the
[39:15] joy of the Holy Ghost.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; The believers at Thessalonica are
[39:20] followers of Paul. But not just Paul to
[39:23] say, well, I'm of Paul and I am of Paul,
[39:24] but they are followers of the Lord,
[39:27] having received the word through Paul
[39:29] and with the joy of the Holy Ghost.
[39:32] So Paul is not ashamed to say that
[39:34] they're following the Lord and him
[39:36] &gt;&gt; because he knows that that is not it's
[39:39] not exclusive and that if they're
[39:41] following him they could not follow the
[39:42] Lord because if he's preaching the word
[39:45] and they follow him then by necessity
[39:48] they are now following Christ.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; And then he says in verse seven
[39:56] so that ye were examples to all that
[39:58] believe in Macedonia and Akaya. So they
[40:01] became examples to others to whom the
[40:03] message was coming to.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice what the word of
[40:05] the Lord did in Thessalonica that the
[40:07] word of the Lord came by the prophet
[40:08] Paul. He preached the word. They
[40:10] received the word. The joy of the Holy
[40:11] Ghost fell upon them and they begin to
[40:13] follow Paul and the Lord. And therefore
[40:16] they were examples to believers in other
[40:18] areas that God uses the agency of man
[40:21] will speak his word through them. He'll
[40:22] vindicate it by the Holy Ghost and they
[40:24] can then follow the Lord.
[40:28] Paul even knew that this is how it
[40:31] worked because he even told them when
[40:32] you read my letters in your assemblies
[40:35] because they were looking to him.
[40:37] They became followers of Paul and Christ
[40:39] and therefore examples to every believer
[40:41] in Macedonia and Akaya.
[40:44] Now I want to say this. So in this sense
[40:47] it's not wrong to follow a man.
[40:53] I'm just thinking maybe you guys just
[40:55] don't trust me or you're like, "Brother,
[40:56] we've been here before. You asked us one
[40:59] time, if I told you a horse, a horse
[41:00] horse's tail was a leg, how many legs
[41:02] would a horse have?" And we all said,
[41:04] "Five." Because you just told us the
[41:05] tail was a leg. And I said, "No, no
[41:06] matter what I tell you, he only has four
[41:08] legs." And then from then on, you've
[41:10] never even trusted me with any questions
[41:12] I ask.
[41:16] If it wasn't wrong for the believers at
[41:18] Thessalonia,
[41:19] Macedonia to follow Paul,
[41:24] then I would say it's not wrong to
[41:25] follow man. It's just which one are you
[41:27] following?
[41:30] &gt;&gt; And you say, well, I'm I'm I'm I'm
[41:32] following myself. Wrong one.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm following this guy. What kind
[41:37] of guy is he?
[41:39] &gt;&gt; We read earlier that in the Bible, it
[41:41] says a scoffer seeks knowledge and will
[41:43] never get it.
[41:44] A fool feeds his mouth with foolishness.
[41:46] If you're following a fool, he's going
[41:48] to feed you foolishness.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; If you're following a scoffer, he's
[41:50] going to feed you mockery and criticism.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Are you following yourself?
[41:58] You following
[42:00] a a makeel believer, a deceiver, or you
[42:02] following God's servant?
[42:06] The believers here. So, I was looking at
[42:09] this for our our youth meeting this
[42:10] afternoon.
[42:12] In each one of these instance, whether
[42:13] it be the Jews or the Ethiopian or even
[42:16] those in Thessalonica, they're
[42:17] confronted with something that
[42:18] contradicts their previously held
[42:19] beliefs.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; And so, how did they resolve that?
[42:26] And let's look at Genesis chapter 24
[42:29] as our
[42:32] foreshadowing has
[42:34] suggested that we would come here in
[42:37] verse 15. after
[42:40] the servant of the Lord has come
[42:44] and he's prayed, you know, let as we
[42:46] read in our text, let it come to pass
[42:47] when I come to the well, let this very
[42:49] thing happen. He's following the
[42:50] leadership of the Lord. He's praying his
[42:51] heart according to the plan of God, the
[42:53] desire of his master. And it came to
[42:55] pass before he had done speaking,
[42:56] behold, Rebecca came out and she's from
[42:59] that very family of Abraham.
[43:04] So now God has Abraham's made the plan.
[43:07] his servant is conducting it. And now
[43:10] into this scene, this drama, this
[43:12] symphony, this composition comes
[43:15] Rebecca.
[43:17] And now let's watch her in this and
[43:20] let's see her resolve. And now he begins
[43:23] to speak. I'm just going to read the
[43:25] whole story as we walk through verses 34
[43:27] to 50 54 in here. And it says, "And he
[43:33] said,"I am Abraham's servant,
[43:36] and the Lord hath blessed my master
[43:38] greatly." Notice how how he he's
[43:41] acknowledging Abraham and the Lord. He
[43:43] doesn't speak of himself except to say,
[43:46] "I am the servant of Abraham who God has
[43:48] blessed. He's become great, and he hath
[43:51] given him." God has given him flocks and
[43:53] herds and silver, and gold, and men
[43:54] servants, and maid servants, and camels
[43:55] and asses. And Sarah, my master's wife,
[43:58] bear a son to my master when she was
[43:59] old. And unto him hath he given all that
[44:01] he hath. And my master made me swear,
[44:04] saying, Thou shalt not take a thou shalt
[44:06] not take a wife of my son of the
[44:08] daughters of the Canaanites in whose
[44:09] land I dwell. But thou shalt go into my
[44:12] father's house into my kindred and take
[44:13] a wife unto my son. And I said to my
[44:17] master, he's telling the whole story.
[44:18] This is what we read already in the
[44:19] first 10 verses. So we're getting the
[44:22] whole story. And I said unto my master,
[44:23] per adventure, the woman will not follow
[44:25] me. And he said unto me, the Lord before
[44:27] whom I walk will send his angel with me
[44:29] and prosper thy way, and thou shalt take
[44:31] a wife for my son of my kindred and of
[44:33] my father's house.
[44:36] Notice just how accurate he's being.
[44:38] Does he repeat it verbatim and exactly?
[44:40] Well, maybe not exactly, but this is
[44:42] accurate to what Abraham wanted. Then
[44:44] thou shalt be clear of this thine oath
[44:46] when thou comest to my kindred, and if
[44:48] they will not give thee one, thou shalt
[44:50] be clear of my oath. And I came this
[44:53] stand to the well and said, this is just
[44:54] on Eleazar's testimony, right? Notice
[44:57] how I want you to begin to enter into
[44:59] maybe the skeptics's scenery. Oh, it's
[45:03] like the Lord showed me that you're the
[45:05] one and he told me that you would listen
[45:08] to me say that,
[45:10] right? And there's like a way that you
[45:12] can just build this up where, well, it
[45:14] seems pretty obvious to me that you
[45:15] could have just orchestrated all this.
[45:17] How do we know this is what happened?
[45:18] But he says, "Oh Lord God of my master
[45:20] Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way
[45:22] which I go, behold, I will stand by the
[45:24] well of water. And it shall come to pass
[45:26] that when the virgin cometh forth to
[45:27] draw water, I say to her, give me, I
[45:29] pray thee, ae, a little water, of thy
[45:30] pitcher to drink, and she say to me,
[45:32] both drink thou, and I will also drink
[45:34] for thy camels, and let the same be the
[45:37] woman whom the Lord hath appointed out
[45:38] of my master's son."
[45:41] Uh, I'm realizing now I cut a lot out
[45:43] here, so let me back up. This is him
[45:46] telling the story to her family. Right?
[45:48] Was that obvious? Did I kind of skip
[45:49] that part? Should we start over? Genesis
[45:51] chapter 24:34.
[45:54] This is where now after he has
[45:57] approached the woman, he prayed, he
[45:59] asked the Lord for guidance and
[46:01] leadership and he said, "I'm going to
[46:02] ask her for a drink and the one to whom
[46:04] is fit for me, she is going to be the
[46:07] one to say that that the one that I'm
[46:08] come to get is going to have the right
[46:10] answer to what I'm praying. She's going
[46:12] to say, "Let me give to your camels
[46:14] also." And she's going to show this
[46:16] great kindness and hospitality. And so,
[46:18] it's then that he he tells her uh uh
[46:21] what God had done. And so, now I I
[46:23] skipped here to be able to tell the
[46:24] story in more brevity, but uh maybe
[46:26] losing that a little bit, but now he
[46:27] comes and he's telling the whole story
[46:29] to her family.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; So, now we're reading the narrative of
[46:32] what happened that day as he tells his
[46:34] family. So he says as the Lord and and
[46:37] so it came to pass that when the virgin
[46:39] cometh forth to draw water, I say to
[46:41] her, give me, I pray thee, a little
[46:42] water of thy pitcher to drink, and she
[46:44] say to me, both drink thou and also draw
[46:47] for thy camels, and let the same be the
[46:49] woman whom the Lord hath appointed out
[46:51] of my master's son out for my master
[46:54] son. And before I had done speaking in
[46:56] my heart, behold, Rebecca came forth
[46:57] with the pitcher on her shoulder, and
[46:59] she went down into the well and drew
[47:01] water. And I said unto her, "Let me
[47:03] drink, I pray thee." And she made haste
[47:04] and let down her pitcher from her
[47:06] shoulder and said, "Drink." And I will
[47:07] give thy camels drink also. So I drank.
[47:09] And she made the camels drink also. And
[47:12] I asked her and said, "Whose daughter at
[47:13] vow?" And she said, "The daughter of
[47:14] Bethl, Nahor's son, whom Milka bear unto
[47:17] him." None of us have ever probably said
[47:20] that before. Who are your mom and dad?
[47:22] Well, my dad is David, who is the son of
[47:25] Morton, who is the son. You know, we
[47:28] just we could kind of, you know, who are
[47:30] you? Well, we're kind of like, well,
[47:31] I'll just leave you in suspense
[47:35] of me at least.
[47:37] And he says, "And I bowed down my head
[47:41] and worshiped the Lord." This is his
[47:43] instinct.
[47:45] He's not like, "Wow, did I do this or
[47:48] what?" He blesses the Lord, God of my
[47:51] master Abraham, which had led me in the
[47:54] right way to take my master's brother,
[47:55] daughter, master's brother's daughter
[47:57] unto his son. Notice how he say God's
[48:00] has led me here.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; The God of Abram has led me in the right
[48:04] way. I followed his leading to this very
[48:06] place at this well in this strange
[48:07] country
[48:09] to the brothers my his brother's
[48:12] daughter to marry his son. So now he
[48:16] says, "And now if you will deal kindly
[48:18] and truly with my master, tell me
[48:22] and if not tell me." In other words,
[48:23] will you let me have your daughter? If
[48:25] not, tell me that I may return to the
[48:27] right hand or to the left. Let me know
[48:30] now so I can go. Then Laban and Bethl
[48:33] answered and said, catch this. This is
[48:36] very important. The thing proceedth from
[48:38] the Lord.
[48:40] We cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
[48:42] Notice how initially they are convinced
[48:45] that wow this sure looks like this is
[48:48] God.
[48:49] This thing proceeded from the Lord. The
[48:51] Lord has blessed Abraham. Abraham has
[48:54] asked you to go. He said this Lord would
[48:56] send his angel before you. You pray and
[48:59] then the very prayer is answered in that
[49:01] very moment and our daughter comes and
[49:02] she's the son my my daughter who is and
[49:05] his who is related comes from the family
[49:08] of whom your master is seeking to get a
[49:10] wife. And they're just like, "Wow, this
[49:11] is this is great. Behold, Rebecca is
[49:14] before thee. Take her and go." And all
[49:17] the daughters here are like, "Where is
[49:18] this going? Take her and go, and let her
[49:21] be thy master's son's wife, as the Lord
[49:25] hath spoken."
[49:30] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass that when Abraham's
[49:32] servant heard the words, he worshiped
[49:33] the Lord, bowing himself
[49:36] to the earth.
[49:38] And the servant wrought
[49:41] brought forth jewels of silver and
[49:43] jewels of gold and raignment and gave
[49:46] them to Rebecca. And he gave also to her
[49:49] brother and to her mother precious
[49:51] things. So the family is starting to
[49:54] benefit from this.
[49:56] I've read a lot on this traditionally
[49:58] and historically. It's interesting here
[49:59] that originally Laban is there uh with
[50:03] Bethl his father, but then when the
[50:05] gifts are given and then from then on
[50:06] it's just Laban and his mother.
[50:10] A and so there's there's a lot of rich
[50:13] tradition and history as to why Bethwell
[50:15] is no longer mentioned. But it says and
[50:16] they did eat and drink and he and the
[50:18] men that were with him and they terried
[50:19] all night and they rose up in the
[50:20] morning and he said send me away unto my
[50:22] master. He wants to go with haste.
[50:25] So initially the father and the brothers
[50:27] speak on Rebecca's behalf.
[50:30] For the moment we can see that this
[50:32] proceeds from God. Take Rebecca as God
[50:36] hath spoken.
[50:39] They believe the message of Eleazar.
[50:42] And they are willing to give their
[50:44] daughter to him as the the servant of
[50:46] God, as an agent of God. And they're
[50:50] enjoying the gifts and the fellowship.
[50:51] And they're having a great time of
[50:52] fellowship. And maybe there's even this
[50:55] thought of man the honor that our
[50:56] family's being bestowed to Mary and to
[50:58] wealth and this great man.
[51:01] But then at morning time when now
[51:03] eleaser the the reality begins to set in
[51:07] and different forces begin to work and
[51:10] in the initial happiness of all this is
[51:12] God and isn't this beautiful and this
[51:14] wonderful and all the gifts and all the
[51:15] moving and all the revival and all the
[51:16] fellowship in the morning they they wake
[51:18] up and through something the familiar
[51:20] challenge of leadership and following
[51:22] raises its head. And in verse 55 it
[51:25] says, "And her brother and her mother
[51:27] said, let the damsel abide with us a few
[51:30] days at least the 10, and after that she
[51:34] shall go."
[51:36] The family has had a change of heart.
[51:39] And we think, well, this is kind of
[51:41] minor. Just give us 10 days. And there's
[51:44] a way that we can look at this and say,
[51:46] well, this seems reasonable. Just as
[51:48] Pharaoh said, well, you can go and
[51:49] worship three days journey, but return
[51:51] again or don't do this and don't do
[51:53] that. leave your children behind. We
[51:54] might say there's something reasonable
[51:55] to this,
[51:58] but in many margins, I don't know if
[51:59] it's in the Scoffield Bible, but many to
[52:02] the almost to the tea, almost every
[52:03] single one, even ones who take this
[52:06] approach this differently, almost all of
[52:07] them acknowledge that the language
[52:09] suggests a full year or at least 10
[52:11] months.
[52:13] So, it wasn't just, can we wait a few
[52:15] days?
[52:17] It was, yeah, can we just observe this
[52:20] ritual?
[52:21] can you just give us a little bit more
[52:23] time?
[52:25] And there is this desire to just at
[52:27] least delay
[52:30] because there's even this thought that
[52:31] well if we we've already we've got a lot
[52:33] of gifts we've already been enriched by
[52:35] this and so if we delay what is there to
[52:38] lose if we delay and listen delay is
[52:41] dangerous
[52:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know what the reason is exactly
[52:46] happy with the gifts from Abraham
[52:48] but suddenly they want to do they
[52:51] they're happy they're rejoicing they're
[52:53] fellowshipping this is great they're
[52:54] happy about the marriage. They're happy
[52:55] with the gifts, but then all of a sudden
[52:56] they want to delay Rebecca's going. Did
[52:59] they want more gifts? Was this an
[53:02] opportunity to up the price? It's like,
[53:03] I don't know if I mentioned this to you,
[53:04] but with inflation, the dowy is much
[53:06] higher.
[53:09] Were they no longer convinced?
[53:12] Did someone say, "How do we know this
[53:15] guy isn't just a con man who knows you
[53:18] you had of a brother named Abraham? He
[53:20] just did some, you know, social
[53:22] engineering here. He's been following
[53:23] you on Facebook. He knows all this stuff
[53:25] about you. How do you know?
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Could you just imagine they showed up
[53:30] with some crumpled up papyrus and say,
[53:32] "This guy was born yesterday.
[53:35] How could you believe him?"
[53:39] And with that, an element of doubt has
[53:41] risen up in their minds.
[53:44] And this doubt needs to be resolved.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; It happens. It's natural. It comes with
[53:48] the course. Wouldn't it just be great if
[53:50] every time somebody showed up and said,
[53:53] "I'm following the Lord. Follow me.
[53:54] You'll be okay." I'm going, "That sounds
[53:56] great. This is my comfort zone." Right?
[53:59] I'm following. All of a sudden,
[54:00] something's going to happen. It's be
[54:01] like, "Whoa, I don't Whoa, whoa,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; got check time.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm so sure anymore."
[54:07] And you're going to have to know that
[54:09] what was said was true.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to know for
[54:13] yourself.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; And so, Eleaza responds. He's got a
[54:16] vision. He's got a declaration. He's got
[54:17] a a message to deliver. And he said unto
[54:18] them, "Hinder me not, seeing the Lord
[54:21] hath prospered my way. Send me away that
[54:24] I may go to my master." And they might
[54:26] have said, "Well, how do we know he
[54:27] prospered your way?" Because now they're
[54:28] getting a little bit more invested in
[54:30] this. And I know I'm uh just maybe uh
[54:32] riffing on this some, but he said,
[54:33] "Well, the Lord did this and Lord did
[54:35] that, and I was praying, your daughter
[54:36] walked out." They might say, "Well, how
[54:37] do we know you were actually praying
[54:39] that prayer?"
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Couldn't it just be a little bit
[54:43] opportunistic? There's some other ladies
[54:45] who said you'd been there a while.
[54:50] And so they say in verse 57, "We'll call
[54:53] the damsel
[54:55] and inquire at her mouth."
[55:01] Although it seemed the family was on
[55:02] board, they believed this is of God.
[55:04] This is wonderful. Isn't this great? Now
[55:06] they seem to be backing out of the
[55:08] agreement.
[55:10] and they say,"Well, let's allow Rebecca
[55:14] the agency to choose."
[55:17] And it's the first time that maybe we
[55:18] see that she is given choice in the
[55:20] matter.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; And they called Rebecca and said unto
[55:24] her, "Will you go with this man?"
[55:30] Do I have another slide the there on the
[55:32] next one? I don't know. I'm just trying
[55:34] to remember. Is there 58?
[55:36] Okay.
[55:39] Will you go with this man?
[55:42] I I really I want to slow down and I
[55:44] want you think about this.
[55:47] Will you really go?
[55:49] And now notice with this man
[55:54] hinting
[55:55] she shouldn't leave with this man.
[55:58] Why don't you wait for Isaac?
[56:02] Why do you need to leave with the
[56:03] servant? If he's so mighty and powerful,
[56:06] why didn't he just send his son? If
[56:09] that's the one you're going to marry, if
[56:11] that's the one you need to follow, if
[56:13] that's the one that you need to believe
[56:14] in, you need to be wed to, then why why
[56:17] deal with the middleman,
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Eleazar? Will you follow this man?
[56:25] They're implying this absent bridegroom.
[56:30] It's the servant that travels to meet
[56:32] the girl.
[56:34] It's the servant that meets the girl.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; It's the servant that performs the signs
[56:39] and gives the gifts.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; When you look at it, it's almost as if
[56:43] Eleazar is acting as a surrogate as a
[56:46] proxy for Isaac.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; When you would expect maybe Isaac to be
[56:51] the one doing it,
[56:53] &gt;&gt; you may at least Abraham or maybe more
[56:55] appropriately Isaac would show up. Hey,
[56:57] you do the dirty work. Who needs a
[56:59] wingman like this? Hey, you know, my
[57:01] master's son thinks you're cute.
[57:04] Hey, so do we need these kind of tricks?
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Rebecca, do your feet hurt?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, there's this idea of like, why
[57:10] don't you just have Isaac do it?
[57:17] &gt;&gt; But she says, "I will go."
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Will you go with this man who's leading
[57:25] you to a husband,
[57:28] or should you just wait? should you
[57:30] tarry?
[57:35] That's why he was told in the beginning,
[57:38] "My master said, I'm not to bring my son
[57:39] here." So they knew the they knew it in
[57:41] the beginning.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; They knew the requirements. They knew
[57:44] what they were following. They knew what
[57:45] they were getting themselves into. There
[57:47] was no ambiguity.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; But now as they hedge, they say, "Well,
[57:49] then ask her." She says, "I will."
[57:54] Traditionally, the rabbis have taught it
[57:56] in Israel and their Sephora and their
[57:58] Midrash
[57:59] that Rebecca in this very moment, just
[58:01] as you could say of of Naomi and these
[58:04] ones that de Ruth demonstrated trust in
[58:08] God.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; She exhibits something in this very
[58:13] moment. I will
[58:16] follow this man.
[58:19] Why?
[58:20] I believe that God, his God, has
[58:24] prospered his master
[58:27] and has sent him
[58:30] to get a bride for his master's son
[58:34] &gt;&gt; and the spirit has led him here and he
[58:37] prayed and has prospered his way. I will
[58:41] go.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Think of this moment. She's in Babylon,
[58:48] Caldia, the city of Neor. She's not in
[58:50] Palestine. She's not in Canaan. She's in
[58:51] a strange land. A land that they were
[58:53] called out of. Abraham was called out
[58:55] of. And she exhibits this great courage
[58:59] in leaving what? Family, birthplace,
[59:03] to go to an unknown land
[59:07] to marry a man she had never met, to
[59:10] live in a land she had never seen seen.
[59:14] Are you Are you picturing Rebecca's
[59:16] predicament situation?
[59:19] And what is it that she represents? What
[59:21] is it she becomes an example of? She
[59:23] becomes an example to Israel, her very
[59:26] descendants
[59:27] when they sold journed in a strange land
[59:29] in Egypt
[59:32] where they would be called out of Egypt
[59:34] following a man that they would say, "I
[59:36] will go and depart." Their matriarch had
[59:39] already demonstrated
[59:41] that that willingness to meet the
[59:43] challenge. And she demonstrated faith in
[59:45] God. She exemplified to her very
[59:47] descendants. There may come a day when
[59:50] you'll souljourn in a strange land. And
[59:52] there'll come one claiming to be a
[59:54] servant of God who will give gifts and
[59:56] signs and you must follow him because
[59:59] he's the one that speaks on God's
[1:00:01] behalf.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; To lead you from a strange land and give
[1:00:04] you the land that I have promised you.
[1:00:07] So I ask you, do you have Rebecca's
[1:00:11] resolve
[1:00:13] to follow the God who is leading?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Is it in us to follow?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; She says, "I will go." And the next
[1:00:21] verse says, "And Rebecca arose."
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; She took her damsel and says, "And they
[1:00:26] rode upon the camels and followed the
[1:00:29] man
[1:00:32] and the servant took Rebecca and went
[1:00:33] his way."
[1:00:35] These camels appear earlier in the
[1:00:36] chapter when you read it. There's this
[1:00:38] beautiful kind of equilibrium and
[1:00:39] symmetry to it. These camels appear sent
[1:00:41] by Abraham led by Ees are now these are
[1:00:44] the very ones that Rebecca watered.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; The ones she cared for, the ones she
[1:00:49] nourished, the ones she was drawn to to
[1:00:51] to support. And it's those very camels
[1:00:53] now that are leading her to her unseen
[1:00:55] bridegroom.
[1:00:59] Rebecca followed Eleazar
[1:01:02] and she was even following his example
[1:01:05] because it says Rebecca arose and rode
[1:01:07] upon the camels. In Genesis 24:10, the
[1:01:09] servant took 10 camels and he arose and
[1:01:12] went.
[1:01:14] In the end, she arose and went. In the
[1:01:16] beginning, he arose and went. So, notice
[1:01:18] the messenger, the servant does in
[1:01:20] following the angel of the Lord. Now,
[1:01:22] she's following and she arose and she
[1:01:25] went. Amen.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; She's following the example of the
[1:01:27] servant who said, "And the man bowed
[1:01:29] down his head and worshiped the Lord.
[1:01:30] This is what he demonstrated in front of
[1:01:32] her. This is what he's paying service
[1:01:33] to. This is how he responds. He bowed
[1:01:36] down his head and worshiped the Lord.
[1:01:37] And he blessed the the Lord God of He
[1:01:39] says, "Bless be the Lord God of my
[1:01:41] master Abraham, whoath not left
[1:01:43] destitute my master of his mercy and his
[1:01:45] truth. I being in the way, the Lord led
[1:01:47] me to the house of my master's
[1:01:49] brethren." She hears the testimony of
[1:01:52] Eleazar. And it's not about him,
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And it's not just about Isaac, right?
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; It's not even just about Abraham. He's
[1:01:59] saying this is what God has done.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; This is what the Lord has done.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; And that is incredible as I've read in
[1:02:08] these things over the last week just how
[1:02:10] much the Jews have debated whether or
[1:02:13] not Eleazar was faithful.
[1:02:18] And and there's so much talk of well he
[1:02:20] did this and he did that and he did this
[1:02:22] and did that. And to me the scriptur is
[1:02:24] being very clear that the reason why the
[1:02:26] woman was willing to follow him is he
[1:02:29] had not behaved in any way untoward
[1:02:31] towards her that would give her any
[1:02:33] reason to believe that he wasn't
[1:02:35] pointing her to the promise
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; that my master has sent me. And this is
[1:02:40] what he said
[1:02:47] cuz he's this is and she's following his
[1:02:49] example.
[1:02:55] Hebrews chapter 13 7 8 and 9. We all
[1:02:58] know verse 8, right? Hebrews 138. This
[1:03:01] is what it speaks to. This cog right in
[1:03:03] the middle of these verses. Remember
[1:03:04] them which have the rule over you.
[1:03:07] That's not like you're a ruler but that
[1:03:10] lead or guide. Remember those that are
[1:03:12] leading you Paul said followers of us
[1:03:16] says follow me as I follow Christ.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; He is teaching these things in these in
[1:03:22] these details in this way of this follow
[1:03:25] me as I follow Christ. follow in my in
[1:03:28] my example so that you become followers
[1:03:30] of God as dear children
[1:03:33] as they became followers of us.
[1:03:36] Who am I but a servant sent from God
[1:03:38] through whom you believe. So he says
[1:03:42] remember them who have le who lead you
[1:03:45] who have spoken unto you the word of
[1:03:47] God. So that's the leadership
[1:03:51] whose faith follow.
[1:03:54] So he's asking to follow their faith.
[1:03:57] Consider in the end of their
[1:03:58] conversation
[1:04:00] the sum of their life and what they're
[1:04:02] pointing to. Not whether or not they
[1:04:04] ever made a mistake. Not whether or not
[1:04:06] you could trust them on all matters. And
[1:04:07] not whether or not but it's like what is
[1:04:09] their faith? What's the sum of what
[1:04:12] they're pointing to?
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; And the next verse is Jesus Christ the
[1:04:18] same
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; yesterday and today and forever.
[1:04:25] Follow those that are leading you
[1:04:28] because their faith is following and
[1:04:30] their faith is centered on Jesus Christ
[1:04:32] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Be not carried about with diverse and
[1:04:37] strange doctrines. For it is a good
[1:04:39] thing that the heart be established with
[1:04:40] grace. So what is he pointing to? Avoid
[1:04:44] these false doctrines and deceptions by
[1:04:47] following the right leadership.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; By following those who have rule over
[1:04:53] you, who point to Jesus Christ the same
[1:04:57] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; As you musicians come to their
[1:05:03] instruments, I'd like to read
[1:05:06] verse 62
[1:05:08] to 65.
[1:05:11] Rebecca has arose
[1:05:14] and she's following the man.
[1:05:18] And as they're traveling on their
[1:05:19] camels, it says, "Isaac came from the
[1:05:21] way of the well of Lorai, for he dwelt
[1:05:23] in the south country. And Isaac went out
[1:05:26] to meditate in the field at the even
[1:05:28] tide, just as the servant had been at
[1:05:32] the well in the evening time.
[1:05:35] And he lifted up his eyes and saw and
[1:05:37] behold the camels were coming.
[1:05:41] And Rebecca lifted up her eyes. And when
[1:05:44] she saw Isaac, she leapt off the camel.
[1:05:48] She jumped. Well, what in the world
[1:05:50] would cause that?
[1:05:53] What would cause her
[1:05:55] to be so moved to him?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; She'd never laid eyes on him before.
[1:06:03] She had only ever heard about him
[1:06:05] through Eleazar.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; But now when she sees him, it says she
[1:06:09] lighted off the camel. And the next
[1:06:11] verse, it's kind of almost backwards,
[1:06:12] but it says, "She said unto the servant,
[1:06:15] when she saw Isaac in the field
[1:06:17] meditating, and he lifts up his eyes,
[1:06:19] and he sees the camels, there must have
[1:06:21] been some moment where there was this
[1:06:22] looking into one another's face from a
[1:06:24] distance. She says unto Eleazar, who is
[1:06:27] that man that walks in the field to meet
[1:06:30] us?
[1:06:32] He's in that field in the evening time.
[1:06:34] Maybe just Lord,
[1:06:36] bless this field. Bless my father's
[1:06:39] servant, Eleazar.
[1:06:41] I'm still grieving over the loss of my
[1:06:43] mother. And he's just there praying. And
[1:06:44] as he's walking, he sees a camel train
[1:06:46] off in the distance. And he starts to
[1:06:49] walk towards it. This looks like this
[1:06:51] looks like that promised
[1:06:54] meeting.
[1:06:56] This looks like that return of Eleazar,
[1:06:58] the faithful servant. And as he's coming
[1:07:01] and maybe his pace begins to quicken,
[1:07:03] Rebecca says, "Who's this one that's now
[1:07:05] coming to meet us in the field?" And
[1:07:06] Eleazar says to him, "It is my master."
[1:07:11] Therefore, she took a veil, covered
[1:07:14] herself, and ran to meet him in the
[1:07:16] field.
[1:07:18] Ran to meet the one that she had been
[1:07:21] betrod to.
[1:07:23] I say through everything that might have
[1:07:25] been taking place and that we see happen
[1:07:27] in this chapter and all the challenges
[1:07:29] that face it from all these different
[1:07:30] directions, here's Rebecca's resolve.
[1:07:32] And I can say, what a resolution.
[1:07:36] What an example of God's program. What
[1:07:38] an example of God's pattern that
[1:07:39] demonstrates the challenges of
[1:07:41] leadership and following.
[1:07:44] And she not only resolved and determined
[1:07:46] in her heart, I will and went,
[1:07:50] but it brought a resolution to all the
[1:07:52] dissonance that was chaotic around her.
[1:07:56] All the questions and all the all the
[1:07:58] negativity. She said, "I'll go."
[1:08:02] And she stands today as an example of
[1:08:05] the bride's song in the evening time.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; An example of the bride's resolution. an
[1:08:10] example of your moment.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; An example of your magnum opus in the mi
[1:08:14] in amid an evil age.
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:21] We must make a choice.
[1:08:24] Beautiful verse in verse 66
[1:08:28] says, "The servant told Isaac all the
[1:08:30] things he had done."
[1:08:32] There's there's that moment where the
[1:08:34] servant goes off the scene. And he
[1:08:36] reports to the son, "This is what I've
[1:08:38] done.
[1:08:40] I brought the message. It's bringing
[1:08:42] forth the bride. My part's finished."
[1:08:45] Then Isaac takes Rebecca into the tent.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; And there is the union.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:08:58] Let's have this kind of resolve in our
[1:09:00] hearts
[1:09:02] that I want to follow Christ.
[1:09:06] And as much as it seems to be better for
[1:09:09] me just to follow him in my own personal
[1:09:11] way and I'm just going to follow my
[1:09:13] heart and my leading,
[1:09:16] you have to
[1:09:18] allow yourself to be vulnerable. You
[1:09:20] almost have to allow yourself to be
[1:09:21] misled in order to be led and say,
[1:09:24] "Lord, I can't lead myself. You said it
[1:09:27] is not in me to know the way. I need
[1:09:29] your spirit to lead me and guide me. And
[1:09:32] so Lord, if you have a servant, if you
[1:09:35] have a voice, if you have a means, Lord,
[1:09:38] I want to be like that unic. Speak to
[1:09:40] me. Show me.
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:45] And let's have let's have Rebecca's
[1:09:47] resolve in this end time to follow God's
[1:09:50] servant. Follow God's leading. God sent
[1:09:52] us a servant in this hour.
[1:09:55] Whose voice are you following? Which one
[1:09:57] will lead you away from that voice? And
[1:09:59] why and to what?
[1:10:03] And it's of necessity sometimes that we
[1:10:05] have to stop and be asked, "Do I know
[1:10:07] what I'm following? Am I blindly
[1:10:09] following?
[1:10:11] Am I just following a decision my
[1:10:12] parents made or somebody else made?"
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; And there comes a moment where they're
[1:10:17] like, "Well, I'm not so sure anymore."
[1:10:19] And you have to answer from your own
[1:10:20] mouth to follow the Lord. Our gracious
[1:10:24] heavenly father, Lord, today we trust
[1:10:26] that we have honored your word. We trust
[1:10:29] that we have paid it.
[1:10:31] It's right. It's due emphasis.
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:37] And Lord,
[1:10:39] if your word told us that every man
[1:10:42] should work out his salvation on his own
[1:10:44] without any help, any leadership of
[1:10:45] other men or voices or scriptures or
[1:10:47] teachings or pastors or teachers, if it
[1:10:51] was just so clear that every man should
[1:10:52] just lock himself up in his own cult and
[1:10:55] work it out and live it out and have his
[1:10:57] own ideals and ideas to which we would
[1:10:59] have maybe 8 billion different ways of
[1:11:01] salvation. If we could see that in the
[1:11:03] word, we could take comfort that I'm
[1:11:04] just going to hike my own hike. I'm just
[1:11:06] going to find my own way. I'm going to
[1:11:07] do what's pleasing to me and what makes
[1:11:08] me happy and just trust that we all get
[1:11:10] along.
[1:11:12] The Lord man has essentially tried that
[1:11:14] for thousands of years.
[1:11:16] And there's only one thing that brings
[1:11:18] peace to earth and that's Jesus Christ.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; There's only one way that there can
[1:11:24] actually be
[1:11:27] uh harmony on earth and justice and
[1:11:30] that's through Jesus Christ.
[1:11:33] Even the ideals of this nation
[1:11:36] cannot be successful without Christians.
[1:11:41] The ideals of democracy and liberty and
[1:11:44] freedom do not exist where Christ is not
[1:11:48] welcome.
[1:11:51] Lord, here we are in an hour where the
[1:11:52] world is in chaos. It's dark. It's
[1:11:55] rejected you. There is no Christ in the
[1:11:57] world anymore.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; We find ourselves in a modern day
[1:12:00] Babylon.
[1:12:01] find ourselves in a modern city of
[1:12:03] Nahor,
[1:12:05] find ourselves in the darkness of
[1:12:07] Leodysia
[1:12:10] and you send your angel
[1:12:13] and you send a messenger
[1:12:16] and it's delivered a message to us
[1:12:20] and Lord that's our way out. Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; It's our way out in this hour.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; And people can take issue with even
[1:12:29] those logistics. Try to build a system
[1:12:32] wherein you do it without man. But Lord,
[1:12:35] that's not the Bible.
[1:12:39] And Lord, I pray that we would not make
[1:12:40] the mistake of glory in man. That we
[1:12:42] would not make more of a servant than we
[1:12:44] ought to. But Lord, may we never
[1:12:46] disregard your servants and your
[1:12:48] prophets and your messengers and your
[1:12:50] ministers. For it is through them that
[1:12:53] you lead.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I believe that we can follow
[1:12:57] this message and the Lord.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; That to truly follow it is to follow
[1:13:02] you.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; If we're following William Brandon but
[1:13:06] not following you, then we're not
[1:13:07] following the message.
[1:13:09] But truly Lord, if we are following his
[1:13:12] pointing, the end of his conversation,
[1:13:15] the word which he has brought, then we
[1:13:17] can be following him and the Lord just
[1:13:19] as they did in Macedonia, Aaya, and
[1:13:21] Thessalonica to follow Paul and the
[1:13:23] Lord.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. It's a terrible time.
[1:13:26] It's a difficult time. More than ever,
[1:13:28] people are looking to voices and
[1:13:30] influencers and leadership, people that
[1:13:33] have a say, people that have a take.
[1:13:36] And Lord, those are the things that are
[1:13:37] polarizing people. But may we not be
[1:13:39] polarized to those apollases and PS of
[1:13:43] society and in this world and democracy
[1:13:45] and politics. But Lord, may we be drawn
[1:13:48] to you through the finger that points to
[1:13:50] you.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; The testimony that this is the Lord.
[1:13:53] This is the Lord. This is the Lord. Not
[1:13:54] me. Not me. Not me, but the Lord. And
[1:13:56] may we follow that with all that is in
[1:13:57] us.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; We love you and ask that you help us,
[1:14:00] especially our young people. Lord, we're
[1:14:02] burdened for them.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; We want to see this church grow in the
[1:14:05] right ways. Lord,
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, fill this church up with people
[1:14:09] who love the word, the hungry, the
[1:14:12] hurting, that are thirsty for truth, not
[1:14:15] just more church.
[1:14:17] I commit everyone to you now in the name
[1:14:18] of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
