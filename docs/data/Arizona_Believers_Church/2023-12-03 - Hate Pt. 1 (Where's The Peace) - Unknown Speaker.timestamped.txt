[0:00] I have planned and trus in that the Lord
[0:02] will give us uh the ability to do so if
[0:04] he leads otherwise we can always pivot
[0:06] but we have uh wanted to take over the
[0:08] next several Services a Christmas series
[0:11] and uh I want to explore and you can
[0:13] give that title slide brother John I
[0:14] want to explore the subject of hate and
[0:17] so Mary Haus just wasn't ringing very
[0:20] good so we're just going to go with the
[0:21] title of hate uh if I get more creative
[0:24] I will and um my title is where is the
[0:28] peace or where is the Peace
[0:30] uh drawing from a Wendy's commercial
[0:32] when I was growing up where's the beef
[0:34] and so where's the peace and I think
[0:35] that this will uh be very relevant to
[0:38] you God's really dealt with my heart on
[0:40] the subject of hate and I want to
[0:41] explore it through several Services if
[0:43] you'll allow us I feel uh heavily
[0:46] burdened on the subject and even very
[0:48] directed with some of the very specific
[0:49] things that we would like to address and
[0:52] I think you'll find that uh maybe we'll
[0:54] put in the context of Christmas and the
[0:56] different things that relate to the
[0:57] birth of Christ or maybe the season but
[1:00] I think the subject matter will be
[1:01] extremely practical and relevant uh just
[1:03] the word of hate has to be very relevant
[1:06] to you I mentioned this to somebody uh
[1:08] last week uh and I just was mentioning
[1:11] what we're going to be preaching on and
[1:12] he said um how relevant this is hate
[1:14] week I didn't even realize it was called
[1:15] hate week uh being The Devout Christian
[1:18] that I am I wouldn't have known that uh
[1:21] but apparently there's even a week
[1:22] called hate week and uh I think it's
[1:25] just relevant in a lot of ways just even
[1:27] with some things people experience from
[1:29] time to time I hope you can draw
[1:30] something from it at the end of the day
[1:31] I'm trusting that we're able to expose
[1:33] the devil and his tactics the ways that
[1:34] he works against us and gets our mind uh
[1:37] moving and some of the things that he
[1:38] does and if we could just take that and
[1:41] ask yourself the question where is the
[1:43] Peace where is the Peace that God has
[1:45] promise so now if you'll turn to Luke
[1:47] Chapter 2 as you're already there like
[1:49] to just start here and look at this this
[1:52] scripture
[1:53] and to take from it a few places where
[1:56] it's kind of putting in context what
[1:58] this birth of Christ is to bring and as
[2:00] we read there how there were shepherds
[2:01] in the field uh there near Bethlehem and
[2:05] at night this Angel comes and the glory
[2:07] of the Lord is around them and it says
[2:08] in verse 10 and the angel said unto them
[2:10] fear not behold I bring you good tidings
[2:14] of great joy which shall be to all
[2:17] people and this phrase Good Tidings of
[2:19] great joy it means good news of intense
[2:22] happiness it's something of great
[2:24] strength of intense gladness uh we're
[2:26] going to bring you good tidings it's the
[2:29] gospel of great great joy so this is
[2:31] something that ought to impact your
[2:33] senses something that's powerfully
[2:35] affecting the way you think the way you
[2:37] feel and that's the news that they were
[2:39] bringing something that would be intense
[2:42] and I want to give you good tidings of
[2:43] great joy which shall be to all people
[2:46] and then this is kind of the that great
[2:49] news the gospel For unto you is Born
[2:51] This Day in the city of David a savior
[2:53] which is Christ the lord and this shall
[2:56] be a sign unto you ye shall find the
[2:58] Babe wrapped in swaddl closes lying in
[3:00] the manger and suddenly there was with
[3:03] the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts
[3:05] praising God and saying this is this
[3:08] pronouncement this excited utterance
[3:10] glory to God in the highest and on Earth
[3:13] peace Good Will toward men there's a lot
[3:17] that we could say to amplify these two
[3:19] phrases of Good Tidings of great joy and
[3:22] uh this uh glory to God and peace on
[3:25] Earth and Good Will towards men but it's
[3:28] declaring God's favor to man kind which
[3:30] is remarkable seeing how dark it was and
[3:32] how forgetful the people had been of God
[3:35] and it's announcing this there's going
[3:37] to be peace there's going to be
[3:38] reconciliation to say peace on Earth and
[3:42] Good Will towards man it's to create
[3:44] some sort of anticipation an expectation
[3:46] for what the Messiah is to be and what
[3:48] he's to accomplish and really kind of
[3:50] sums up salvation and Reconciliation and
[3:53] this great peace that's going to be
[3:55] given to men and I'd like to uh Focus
[3:58] for a few moments on the peace that is
[4:01] brought to us through Jesus Christ says
[4:03] in Romans 5:1 therefore being justified
[4:06] by faith we have peace with God through
[4:09] our Lord Jesus Christ being justified by
[4:12] faith and being our sins being forgiven
[4:14] we have peace with God so this is when
[4:17] he declares and they said we're bringing
[4:18] you the gospel Good Tidings of intense
[4:21] gladness and glory to God in the highest
[4:23] because there's peace on Earth and Good
[4:25] Will to men it speaks of the peace that
[4:28] we can have with God God through Christ
[4:31] says in chap verse 8 of that same
[4:33] chapter but God commendeth his love
[4:35] toward us in that while we were yet
[4:37] sinners Christ died for us much more
[4:40] than being now justified by his blood we
[4:43] shall be saved from wrath through him
[4:46] that's speaking of God's Wrath and you
[4:48] say well I'm saved but people still get
[4:50] angry at me well you might want to
[4:51] evaluate your conduct but also there's
[4:53] just some Knuckleheads out there I guess
[4:55] that get angry pretty easily but we're
[4:57] saved from the wrath of God that this is
[4:59] the peace that he gives us that God's no
[5:01] longer his wrath has been satisfied
[5:04] being justified I'm not subject to
[5:06] punishment therefore we do not have to
[5:08] live in fear of God's anger or God's
[5:11] Wrath or God's uh condemnation we have
[5:14] peace through Jesus Christ it says in
[5:17] verse 10 for if when we were enemies
[5:20] that's what he say while we were yet
[5:21] sinners and now he uses this phrase and
[5:23] I hope this can kind of follow through
[5:25] the whole service when we were enemies
[5:27] we were reconciled to God by the death
[5:29] of his son much more being reconciled we
[5:32] shall be saved by his life amen we were
[5:35] at one time an enemy with God because of
[5:38] sin and now when we were enemies we're
[5:40] reconciled by the death of his son the
[5:43] relationships changed where we don't
[5:45] have to think of God as our adversary we
[5:48] can't we don't have to think of God as
[5:49] being one who's angry with us who's
[5:50] going to punish us and who's going to uh
[5:53] destroy us or do something to harm us we
[5:55] can rest knowing that God's Wrath has
[5:57] been satisfied that we're no longer
[5:59] enemies we've been reconciled together
[6:01] with him Paul writes it this way in
[6:04] Ephesians chap 2: 14 15 and 16 for he is
[6:08] our peace who ha made both one and hath
[6:11] broken down the middle wall of partition
[6:13] between us there was a wall between us
[6:16] there was a barrier between us there was
[6:18] there was something there that uh made
[6:20] us um against God and our minds against
[6:23] God and we resisted God but through the
[6:25] work of the Cross uh that wall has been
[6:27] torn down the middle wall of ition
[6:29] between us is abolished he says verse 15
[6:33] having abolish abolished in his flesh
[6:35] the enmity even the law of Commandments
[6:38] contained in ordinances this enmity is
[6:41] hatred he hath abolished the hatred that
[6:45] was between us Heath abolish this anger
[6:48] this wrath even the law of Commandments
[6:49] contained in ordinances for to make in
[6:52] himself of Twain one new man so making
[6:55] peace that he might reconcile both unto
[6:58] God in one body by the cross having
[7:01] slain the enmity
[7:03] thereby where there was hatred where
[7:06] there was hostility the the Messiah
[7:08] through his death he slays that he
[7:11] abolishes it if there was a a Chasm if
[7:14] there was a gap if there was a wall
[7:16] between you if there was some sort of
[7:17] distance and well we're not getting
[7:19] along anymore and we're not talking
[7:21] we're aranged the the death of Jesus
[7:23] Christ brings peace and brings parties
[7:26] together and it reconciles it to where
[7:28] there's no more h ility there's no more
[7:30] anger there's no more finger pointing
[7:32] there's no more blame there's no well
[7:34] you're going to get what's coming to you
[7:36] it's one of those things that's always
[7:38] uh people live their whole lives looking
[7:39] over their shoulder wonder if
[7:40] something's going to catch up to them
[7:42] and or or whenever there's disagreement
[7:44] or somebody's done something that's hurt
[7:45] somebody there's always this tendency
[7:47] sometimes when you think it's all been
[7:49] forgiven and it's no longer an issue and
[7:51] everything's in the past it comes up
[7:53] again it's kind like well you remember
[7:54] that one time and so there's still some
[7:56] sort of hostility or conflict God is
[7:58] saying go gone am absolutely gone
[8:03] there's there's not a a way that we walk
[8:04] with Christ for a while and we're really
[8:06] really happy and things are going well
[8:07] he's I love God is where things are
[8:09] going really well he's like I love you
[8:10] you're Justified you never did it in the
[8:12] first place and then you miss the
[8:14] service and he goes you know what as a
[8:15] matter of fact I was just thinking about
[8:16] when you and bring something up no it's
[8:20] there's peace with God we're no longer
[8:23] enemies and this peace that it's
[8:25] speaking of is quietness tranquility oh
[8:29] brother Loy was singing that oh the I've
[8:31] heard it said the gospel is rest that's
[8:33] what it is it's Tranquility there's this
[8:36] exemption from Rage and havoc and Chaos
[8:39] of War uh there's there's no conflict
[8:42] you can rest there's uh you know how it
[8:46] can be in life and there's certain
[8:47] situations where you're just kind of
[8:49] always uptight a little tense because
[8:50] you don't know what's going to happen uh
[8:52] even if it's just you you uh you're in
[8:54] the middle of a big prank war and you
[8:55] never know when you're going to turn
[8:56] around a corner and somebody's going to
[8:58] throw water on you so you're you're
[8:59] always on edge you're always looking
[9:01] you're always watching and you always
[9:02] have to be on guard well this is to be
[9:05] to have peace means you're not looking
[9:07] over your shoulder you don't have to be
[9:09] on guard you don't have to worry about
[9:10] tomorrow whether or not your sins are
[9:12] going to catch up to you if you're
[9:13] justified by faith you have peace it's
[9:16] quietness this word peace means Harmony
[9:18] or Accord there's agreement there and
[9:22] because of this harmony Accord the word
[9:24] and the scripture especially in the Old
[9:25] Testament the images that are raised and
[9:28] then are carrying over into the New
[9:29] Testament to have peace means that
[9:31] there's
[9:32] safety and there's Prosperity because of
[9:35] the peace when you're at War there's
[9:37] certain resources that have to be
[9:39] dedicated to Warfare when you're at War
[9:40] there's certain things you cannot do in
[9:42] order to safeguard yourself and so in
[9:44] the Bible when it speaks of Peace it
[9:46] means there's safety and there being
[9:47] safety there's Prosperity uh for you to
[9:50] do the things to create income to grow
[9:53] your crops and to sustain yourselves and
[9:55] so for there to be peace that means
[9:57] there's safety and there's prosperity
[9:59] there's Harmony there's agreement and
[10:01] your enemies have laid down their arms
[10:04] and everyone is
[10:06] satisfied when
[10:08] Zachariah at the announcement uh that he
[10:11] was going to have a child when he was no
[10:13] longer and he was no longer mute he
[10:15] could speak it says in Luke 1:71 he says
[10:20] that we should be saved speaking of the
[10:21] Messiah to come that we should be saved
[10:23] from our enemies and from the hand of
[10:26] all that hate
[10:27] us when you expresses this as a Jew and
[10:32] and the promise of the Messiah we should
[10:34] be saved from our enemies and from the
[10:37] hand of all that hate us this is more
[10:39] than just peace with
[10:41] God but this is peace on
[10:44] Earth this is suggesting arrest from
[10:46] hostility and torment or the attack of
[10:51] haters in other words Zachariah was
[10:53] saying I know haters going to hate but
[10:54] guess what one day they
[10:56] ain't it was saying this is this is
[10:59] going to be peace we're going to be safe
[11:00] from our enemies and from the hand that
[11:02] all all that haters haters going to hate
[11:04] was another working title I was going to
[11:05] use and we may still use it we got a few
[11:08] more services yet but he's talking about
[11:10] not just AR rest from the uh wrath of
[11:13] God or enmity with God but it's saying
[11:15] we're going to be safe from our enemies
[11:17] those that hate us and so there's
[11:20] there's this relaxing of the hostility
[11:23] externally there's no looking over your
[11:25] shoulder there's no wondering if the
[11:26] Philistines are going to come it's no
[11:28] worry whether not the syrians or the
[11:30] Assyrians or the Gentiles are going to
[11:31] attack us and ravish our land and carry
[11:33] us off into Babylon say there's going to
[11:35] be peace because he would have had in
[11:37] mind Isaiah 9: 6 and 7 For unto us a
[11:41] child is born these are the very things
[11:43] these angels are glory to God in the
[11:45] highest on Earth peace and Good Will
[11:47] toward men because this is the promise
[11:49] of the Messiah For unto us a child is
[11:52] born unto us a son is given and the
[11:55] government shall be upon his shoulder
[11:57] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[11:59] ful counselor the Mighty God the
[12:01] Everlasting father the Prince of
[12:05] Peace because that messiah's Reign is
[12:08] going to bring peace therefore there's
[12:10] safety and prosperity this is the reain
[12:12] that's envisioned by these even these
[12:14] Shepherds would have been oh this
[12:16] Kingdom Reign this reign of peace and
[12:17] Tranquility is upon us of the increase
[12:20] of his government and of the increase of
[12:23] his peace there shall be no end upon the
[12:26] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[12:28] order it and to establish it with
[12:30] judgment and Justice from henceforth
[12:32] even forever the Zeal of the Lord of
[12:34] hosts will perform
[12:37] this this is the peace that is Promised
[12:39] in
[12:40] Christ and I'm I'm wanting to lay that
[12:43] Foundation of this great peace asking
[12:44] the question where's the peace because
[12:47] this peace promised by Christ is in
[12:49] stark contrast to hate right when
[12:52] they're even speaking of the Messiah and
[12:54] what he's to accomplish Paul is saying
[12:56] we've been saved from the wrath of God
[12:59] we were enemies but we're no longer
[13:01] enemies we've been reconciled Zachariah
[13:03] proclaims we're going to be saved from
[13:04] our enemies in the hand of all that hate
[13:06] us to have peace contrast hate if I can
[13:10] even say this his peace is the answer to
[13:12] hate that where there's hate peace is
[13:15] the
[13:17] answer now with that as a a setting I
[13:20] want to point to Matthew chapter 10 and
[13:22] so I will in Matthew chapter 10 few
[13:25] verses here from verse 34- 37 when we
[13:28] were speaking on the subject of perfect
[13:31] love earlier this year we took a service
[13:33] called love and hate there's a lot that
[13:35] we could still draw from that there's a
[13:37] lot of things we were trying to show
[13:38] that there's a there's a wrong kind of
[13:40] jealousy and envy but then there's a
[13:41] Godly jealousy and as we address uh the
[13:45] subject of hate there's some things we
[13:46] need to identify about hate and hatred
[13:49] but now Christ I mean this is what the
[13:51] Bible says Good Tidings of great joy uh
[13:54] on Earth peace and goodwi to men and
[13:56] then we read what Paul has said we read
[13:58] uh what Zachariah proclaims we read what
[14:00] Isaiah 9 has to say and so we're
[14:03] thinking something right and he says
[14:05] think not that I'm come to send peace on
[14:07] Earth and we're like that's exactly what
[14:09] I was
[14:10] thinking and he's saying don't think not
[14:14] that I'm come to send peace on Earth I'm
[14:17] come not to send peace but a sword and
[14:20] now I'm
[14:24] confused because the Bible's clearly
[14:26] saying there's to be peace and Jesus is
[14:29] saying now and I think you could think
[14:32] about this maturely and know that I'm
[14:33] not a skeptic and I'm not trying to
[14:36] create
[14:36] dissonance uh we know that there's this
[14:39] harmony here that there's truth here he
[14:40] said you you're thinking in your way
[14:43] about way things are going to transpire
[14:44] in the way things are going to be and
[14:46] he's saiding maybe you haven't got it
[14:47] all figured out and the way that you
[14:49] think it's going to be isn't exactly how
[14:51] it's going to happen and where you're
[14:53] thinking all your enemies are going to
[14:55] stop hating you and the Messiah is going
[14:57] to rule and reign in a particular way my
[14:59] coming is actually going to bring
[15:01] division for I'm not come I am come to
[15:04] set a man at variance against his father
[15:08] and the daughter against her mother and
[15:10] the daughter-in-law against her
[15:11] mother-in-law and a man's foe shall be
[15:14] they of his own household he that loveth
[15:16] father or mother more than me is not
[15:18] worthy of me and he that loveth son or
[15:21] daughter more than me is not worthy of
[15:24] me this is quite a quite a declaration
[15:27] and as we read it maybe if we read it
[15:29] without any other knowledge of scripture
[15:31] maybe if we put it in more modern
[15:32] language uh he's saying that you you've
[15:35] got to choose me over your
[15:38] family a a and we would even we could
[15:41] put it in maybe some terms that are
[15:42] narcissistic and we think this is going
[15:44] to be somebody who's just going to take
[15:45] us away from the people that care about
[15:46] us going to manipulate us going to
[15:48] control us and it sounds pretty harsh
[15:51] but he he's expressing something about
[15:53] human nature and how that we could go
[15:56] deeper in several other scriptures there
[15:58] a lot there in that sermon on Love and
[15:59] Hate he says it this way in Luke 14:26
[16:02] If any man come to me and hate not his
[16:04] father and mother and wife and children
[16:06] and breth and sisters yay in his own
[16:08] life also he cannot be my
[16:12] disciple I I I know that's that's strong
[16:15] that's a strong
[16:17] imagery and it's the T kind of things
[16:19] that makes some people get kind of tense
[16:20] and anxious and nervous because of human
[16:23] experience but what he's expressing is
[16:25] it's this hatred is to reject any
[16:28] influence that would call you away from
[16:31] Christ it it's not it's not a you U your
[16:35] mom serving God all our life and
[16:37] teaching you truth and filled with the
[16:39] Holy Ghost a good Godly Christian and
[16:41] then one day you meet Christ and you
[16:43] come home and your mom says oh honey
[16:45] it's so good to have you home I hate you
[16:48] it's like I know you've been telling me
[16:50] that for 21 years he like no I really do
[16:52] now because now I'm a Christian and the
[16:54] red letter says if I don't hate you and
[16:58] the mom's like
[16:59] right it's not it's not asking that we
[17:01] immediately turn around and start hating
[17:03] people as a way to declare our love to
[17:05] God our love to Christ but it's to it's
[17:08] to reject any influence that would call
[17:11] you away from Christ that love of family
[17:14] that would call to us and uh want to
[17:16] nurture you and look out after you and
[17:18] even the the peace we have sometimes and
[17:20] knowing that Daddy will take care of it
[17:22] or Mom you will take care of it saying
[17:24] that when you give your heart to God and
[17:25] you want to serve the Lord if they would
[17:27] try to call you away from that you would
[17:29] have to treat them as if you hated them
[17:32] by rejecting that that call to you and
[17:35] asking you to do something that you know
[17:37] would displease
[17:38] Goden he says I will set a man at
[17:41] variance that means to cut into two or
[17:42] to sever I will divide a man from his
[17:46] family they will be pitted against each
[17:48] other
[17:49] right and I I'm acknowledging the
[17:52] Paradox today he promises peace but it's
[17:56] division that comes
[17:59] he promises peace but it's animosity
[18:01] that rises up he promises peace think
[18:04] not that I come to bring peace on Earth
[18:05] in other words you're thinking
[18:06] everybody's going to soon get along with
[18:08] the Messiah but actually there's going
[18:09] to be Warfare there's going to be
[18:10] hostility there's going to be opposition
[18:13] he he's a polarizing figure if we could
[18:15] put it that way where there's Christ if
[18:17] you're going to serve him you've got to
[18:18] serve him because then there's an
[18:20] opposition that comes against
[18:24] it you've got to be with him there's he
[18:27] talks about no man can serve two
[18:29] masters cuz he'll you'll either uh
[18:32] you'll love one and hate the
[18:34] other and it's showing that there's got
[18:36] if there's going to be dedication if
[18:38] there's going to be service to Christ in
[18:40] in the presence of the disagreement and
[18:42] the presence of sin that's going to
[18:44] create
[18:45] opposition so this and I hope I'm not
[18:49] failing to to make it um I hope it's
[18:53] making sense to you because I want to
[18:56] move move on this hate now then is the
[19:01] opp I want to look at hate as the
[19:02] opposite of
[19:04] peace now we might think well love is
[19:06] the opposite of of hate and I'm I'm not
[19:08] disagreeing with that
[19:10] notion I'm looking at hate now as the
[19:13] opposite of peace and I'm making that
[19:15] connection very
[19:17] deliberately hate is defined as an
[19:19] intense negative emotional response
[19:21] towards someone or
[19:22] something has its atmology in spiked or
[19:26] malice it's an intense negative
[19:29] emotional response towards someone or
[19:32] something just as it's declared we bring
[19:34] you good tidings of great joy this was
[19:36] to be uh good news of intense gladness
[19:39] hate is on a different level it's an
[19:41] intense negative response towards
[19:43] someone or something has some sort of
[19:46] malice or
[19:47] spite it's to regard with extreme ill
[19:50] will to have a passionate aversion to
[19:54] it's not saying that you don't like it
[19:56] if you hate something this is to treat
[19:58] something as an enemy it has intensity
[20:01] to it and and I hope that there's this
[20:04] is
[20:05] relevant uh uh for you as you think
[20:07] about these feelings of hatred and to
[20:11] hate it's something that it's negative
[20:15] it's emotional and it's int intense it
[20:18] it's ill
[20:20] will I I guess in the the way that
[20:23] vernacular changes and how that you know
[20:26] there's a time when something was bad
[20:28] and it it was good a and even now maybe
[20:32] still when something is sick it's like
[20:34] really good you like I'm sick hey you
[20:37] need to be humble right let somebody
[20:39] else make that decision I and and there
[20:42] I don't but I don't know if they've
[20:43] co-opted hate just yet and to something
[20:46] positive to have hate is negative it's
[20:49] to hate is to treat something as your
[20:52] enemy now if if you could allow yourself
[20:55] to begin to picture what what is
[20:58] intended and what is in hate that if you
[21:01] hate something your aversion to it is
[21:03] you think that it's adversarial it's
[21:05] against you you're against it that it
[21:07] can do some harm to
[21:10] you now in John chapter 15 as we're
[21:13] hoping to understand better why Jesus
[21:15] said that I'm come to set a man divide a
[21:17] man with his own
[21:19] family and there's this hatred this
[21:21] hostility that's going to come as a
[21:23] result of
[21:24] Christ in John chapter 15 several verses
[21:27] from 17 to
[21:29] 25 this will just give us a larger
[21:31] context for this these things I command
[21:33] you that you love one
[21:39] another lest we confuse what he is
[21:42] expressing in Luke and Matthew
[21:45] earlier about if any man come and hate
[21:48] not his father and I've come to set a
[21:50] man at variance let it not not be any
[21:52] confusion he says you should love one
[21:55] another if the world hate you you know
[21:58] that it hated me before it hated
[22:01] you if you were of the world the world
[22:04] would love his own but because you are
[22:07] not of the world but I have chosen you
[22:09] out of the world therefore the world
[22:11] hateth you now God Christ commands us to
[22:15] love and in commanding us to love he
[22:18] identifies the hate that remains in the
[22:20] world and and his response isn't to say
[22:23] and because they hate you you can hate
[22:25] them back he's saying we ought to love
[22:28] one another and in the in this
[22:29] commandment to love he's acknowledging
[22:31] that there will be intense negative
[22:34] emotions directed to us that there may
[22:37] even be intense negative emotions trying
[22:39] to be provoked within us and love one
[22:41] another and the world is going to hate
[22:43] you and just remember they hate you
[22:45] because they hated me first remember the
[22:48] word that I said unto you the servant is
[22:50] not greater than his Lord if they have
[22:52] persecuted me they will also persecute
[22:55] you if they've kept my saying they will
[22:57] keep keep yours also but all things will
[23:01] they do unto you for my name's sake
[23:03] because they know not him that sent me
[23:06] if I had not come and spoken unto them
[23:08] they had not had sin but now they have
[23:10] no cloak for their sin kind of helping
[23:13] us understand a little bit why Christ is
[23:14] so
[23:16] reviled
[23:18] now let's continue in this and
[23:21] notice uh as we'll keep reading some of
[23:24] these other places how that he's
[23:26] identifying the B human nature that's
[23:29] unredeemed and their propensity to
[23:32] hate he that hateth me hateth my father
[23:35] also if I had not done among them The
[23:37] Works which none other man did they had
[23:39] not had sin but now they have both seen
[23:42] and hated both me and my father but this
[23:45] cometh to pass that the word might be
[23:47] fulfilled that is written in their law
[23:48] they hated me without a
[23:52] cause
[23:53] this it would seem to
[23:56] suggest that there could be some basis
[23:59] for hate the law deals with it quite a
[24:02] bit about if a man hates his neighbor if
[24:03] he hates this he hates that and
[24:05] sometimes it's getting down to the root
[24:06] cause as to why one would hate and one
[24:08] why would have this enity with somebody
[24:11] else but in Psalm 694 says they had they
[24:14] that hate me without a cause more than
[24:17] the hairs of my head they that would
[24:19] destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully
[24:22] are Mighty then I restored that which I
[24:25] took not
[24:26] away incredible statement but he says
[24:29] they hate me without cause in Christ is
[24:31] saying I've come I've preached the word
[24:33] yes it exposed their sins I've come I've
[24:34] done Mighty Works yes it took away uh it
[24:37] exposed their sin but because I've done
[24:40] what the fathers asked me to do they
[24:42] hate me for it he says they're not just
[24:45] in their
[24:46] hatred they're they're they cannot be
[24:49] excused for their hatred they hate me
[24:51] without cause they are my enemies
[24:55] wrongfully they have they have no right
[24:58] to do it as as even the songwriters have
[25:01] exclaimed and says well what what has he
[25:03] done he healed your sick what has he
[25:05] done he raised your debt what has he
[25:07] done he's paid for you the price of your
[25:09] sins he he's not worthy of this
[25:11] punishment he's not worthy of this death
[25:13] they have made themselves an enemy of
[25:15] the Cross
[25:17] wrongfully brother Bram in the sermon
[25:19] discernment of spirit says and you
[25:21] notice Jesus when he
[25:24] came he was loved of the father and then
[25:28] he brings this parallel and father and
[25:29] the father gave Joseph a coat of many
[25:31] colors the rainbow of Covenant and the
[25:33] father God gave his son Jesus the
[25:36] Covenant and then the Jewish brother
[25:39] hated him without a
[25:42] cause they were jealous of Joseph and it
[25:45] was in their jealousy of Joseph that
[25:47] they hated him notice this intense
[25:49] negative emotional response and these
[25:51] other factors if there's some enmity or
[25:53] jealousy some envy and how it works to
[25:55] produce this hatred and this callousness
[25:57] and even to act to throw their little
[25:59] brother into a a pit and to sell him
[26:01] into slavery he says the Jewish brother
[26:04] hated him Christ now without cause he
[26:06] had no reason to hate him he was
[26:09] spiritual and he was God's word made
[26:11] manifest he come to do the will of the
[26:13] father he come to fulfill the scripture
[26:17] I I want you to catch this because we're
[26:19] not put you haven't put yourself maybe
[26:21] in the seat of the scornful and to put
[26:24] yourself in the shoes of these Jews who
[26:26] were who are there looking calling for
[26:28] his crucifixion and you don't put
[26:30] yourself in the seat of those of the
[26:31] world when Jesus says well if they hate
[26:34] you they hated me first we're not
[26:36] putting ourselves as a hater we're
[26:37] putting ourselves as the
[26:39] hated but it it would do us some good to
[26:42] think about how that we sometimes hate
[26:44] and the reasons why we hate and why the
[26:47] world is hating Christ he says they
[26:49] hated him without cause they were his
[26:51] enemies wrongfully it may not be as
[26:54] Sinister as we think it is cuz notice
[26:56] what Jesus what brother brandham says he
[26:59] says he came to do the will of the
[27:00] father he came to fulfill the scripture
[27:03] he came to bring them
[27:05] peace but they misunderstood
[27:08] him and hated him without a
[27:11] cause he came to bring peace but they
[27:13] misunderstood him now that is that ought
[27:18] to be eye openening and I don't want to
[27:20] get into it in great detail this morning
[27:22] of course if the Lord would have me to I
[27:23] certainly will but saying that hate can
[27:27] AR eyes solely on the basis of a
[27:31] misunderstanding an
[27:33] intense negative emotional response to
[27:36] someone or something solely because of a
[27:40] misunderstanding that there can be a
[27:42] strong a ver passionate aversion to
[27:44] something extreme ill will to treat
[27:47] someone as your enemy on the basis of a
[27:52] misunderstanding and therefore with this
[27:54] mis says they hated him without a cause
[27:57] they didn't stop to try to see what he
[27:59] was trying to
[28:00] achieve now this is an anecdote to hate
[28:04] I guess maybe just getting right into it
[28:06] there's no way really to bury the lead
[28:07] or kind of hide the ball here they
[28:10] didn't try to stop they didn't stop to
[28:12] try to see what he's trying to Chief
[28:14] they just judged him because they didn't
[28:16] agree with because that he didn't agree
[28:17] with
[28:19] him and in the face of
[28:23] disagreement and on its face there's a
[28:25] disagreement and instead of trying to
[28:28] understand where he was coming from what
[28:31] he was trying to achieve they just
[28:32] judged him on the surface and on the
[28:35] basis that he disagreed with
[28:37] him and on the basis of disagreement and
[28:40] misunderstanding that was enough to
[28:42] hate that was enough to
[28:45] crucify and Paul says it this way in
[28:47] Galatians chap 4:1 16 he says am I
[28:51] therefore become your enemy because I
[28:52] tell you the
[28:56] truth that's what brother Bram
[28:57] identifies as the reason why Christ
[29:00] became an enemy it's why Jesus says in
[29:02] John 15 how he became an enemy because I
[29:05] gave them no cloak for their sin now I'm
[29:07] their enemy as long as they could excuse
[29:10] themselves as long as they could get
[29:11] away with something they were fine but
[29:13] now I'm their enemy he says am I
[29:15] therefore become your enemy am I become
[29:18] hated the word there could have easily
[29:20] been translated am I therefore hated by
[29:23] you am I H you become hostile you oppose
[29:28] me when he says I'm your enemy it means
[29:29] you hate me you oppose me just because I
[29:32] tell you the
[29:34] truth it
[29:37] seems when you put it in terms of hating
[29:39] Christ we think of the
[29:42] most
[29:44] spiteful honorous hate there
[29:49] is but hate
[29:51] itself is such a nasty
[29:54] thing I don't know if we put it this way
[29:57] when we spoke on Love and Hate actually
[29:58] we looked at it in a little bit
[29:59] different perspective how that Christ is
[30:03] speaking to us if any man come to me and
[30:06] not hate his father and mother that
[30:08] where there's love where there's love
[30:10] there has to be some there has to be
[30:12] some
[30:13] hate as a result of that
[30:16] love but if perfect love now I'm not
[30:19] looking at the The Godly jealousy or
[30:21] perfect a perfect hatred just yet but a
[30:24] perfect love is God's ultimate and and
[30:27] then we say that God is love then Satan
[30:29] can be expressed in terms of
[30:31] hate animosity that acrimony hostility
[30:36] and if that's what God is trying to
[30:38] bring us to a place of perfect love
[30:40] Satan's ultimate would bring you to a
[30:41] place of
[30:43] hate in Matthew chapter 5:
[30:47] 38-48 I'm reading this it's
[30:49] lengthy I think it's worth reading
[30:52] through just to see the full context of
[30:55] what Christ expresses here you''ve heard
[30:58] it that it hath been said an eye for an
[31:01] eye and a tooth for a tooth and we said
[31:03] amen closed her Bibles went home and
[31:04] never forgot it an eye for an eye and a
[31:07] tooth for tooth it says well if somebody
[31:09] takes if someone slaps you slap them
[31:12] back if somebody lies on you you lie on
[31:14] them back it's kind of Tit for Tat an
[31:16] eye for an eye and tooth for tooth uh if
[31:18] they want to escalate conflict I I I'm
[31:20] going to anti up I'm going to I'm going
[31:22] to come hard he says but but I say unto
[31:25] you that you resist not e
[31:28] Vil that where there is someone who is
[31:30] offending and someone that's doing
[31:32] something wrong that when you respond in
[31:35] kind and you respond likewise he's
[31:37] saying you can't if they've given you
[31:39] evil you can't give evil back but
[31:42] whosoever shall smite thee on the right
[31:44] cheek turn to him the other also we
[31:47] spoke many many services a few years ago
[31:49] here on uh borders and boundaries or
[31:55] barriers and boundaries rather
[31:58] did I title it wrong the first time no I
[31:59] think it was barriers and boundaries a
[32:01] and how that there's certain things that
[32:03] we make barriers there's certain things
[32:04] that the word of God wants us to make a
[32:05] boundary and so I just feel like I've
[32:07] got to call out this qualification in
[32:09] studying the scripture in depth we found
[32:11] that turning the other cheek wasn't
[32:13] becoming subservient to someone who's
[32:15] abusing you and doesn't mean as
[32:17] Christians we just have to acues and let
[32:19] people abuse us and treat us toxically a
[32:22] and do all sorts of evil and harmful
[32:23] things to us but to turn the other cheek
[32:25] is to respond in way that declares
[32:28] they're not the master and ruler over
[32:30] you without returning evil and
[32:33] kind says and if any man will sue thee
[32:35] at the law and take away thy coat let
[32:37] him have thy cloak also and whosoever
[32:40] shall compel thee to go mile go with him
[32:42] Twain this is just so opposite of the
[32:44] human nature and Instinct give to him
[32:46] that asketh the and from him that would
[32:47] borrow of thee turn thou not not thou
[32:50] away ye have heard that hath been said
[32:52] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[32:54] thine
[32:55] enemy and we think to that that makes
[32:58] some sense he says but I say unto you
[33:00] love your
[33:02] enemies bless them that curse
[33:05] you do good to them that hate you and
[33:09] pray for them which despitefully use you
[33:12] and persecute
[33:15] you as he says if they persecute you
[33:18] just know that they also persecuted me
[33:21] if they hate you know also that they
[33:23] hated me and it gives us puts us on
[33:25] notice that the world is going to hate
[33:27] me the world is going to persecute me
[33:29] and we might say but he taught me to
[33:31] love one another to love the disciples
[33:32] to love the Believers to love those who
[33:35] who believe in Christ but now he takes
[33:37] it a step further we could say he had
[33:39] already established that you're not to
[33:41] treat those that hate you with hate also
[33:43] he says but love your enemies bless them
[33:46] that curse you do good to them that hate
[33:48] you in other words don't respond to hate
[33:50] with
[33:53] hate that you may be the children of
[33:55] your father which is in heaven for he
[33:57] maketh his son to rise on the evil and
[33:59] on the good and sendeth reain on the
[34:00] just and the unjust for if you love them
[34:03] which love you this is that a real the
[34:07] real Crux of it if you love them which
[34:08] love you what reward have you do not
[34:11] even the publicans the same and if you
[34:14] salute your brethren only what do you
[34:15] more than others do not even the
[34:17] publicans
[34:19] so that's not Republicans it's
[34:22] publicans be therefore perfect even as
[34:25] your father which is in heaven is
[34:27] perfect there's a lot that we can draw
[34:29] from this even say showing that God does
[34:32] not withhold the sun and the rain from
[34:35] the unjust and the
[34:37] evil that God has not even P banished
[34:40] the wicked to where every day is just a
[34:42] day of torment and boils and Sadness and
[34:45] Sorrow and all you have to do is just
[34:47] look out and see the ones who are
[34:48] itching themselves wow there's a sinner
[34:49] right there yeah yeah they're the ones
[34:51] that are just burning as they walk down
[34:53] the streets that's just not the way God
[34:55] has done it and he says that we ought to
[34:58] love our enemies because if you only
[35:00] love those that love you what good is
[35:02] that how is that even real love if
[35:05] you're only kind to those who are kind
[35:07] to you if you only salute the Brethren
[35:09] well how are you better than the
[35:10] publicans and so he says be therefore
[35:12] perfect even as your father which is in
[35:14] heaven is perfect and it's saying that
[35:16] this this is perfection to elevate
[35:19] yourself above
[35:21] hate to be able to live above hatred to
[35:24] be able to not let hatred bring you down
[35:27] and the criticism and the and the
[35:29] animosity and all the negativity to be
[35:32] able to live above that he's saying that
[35:34] that's Perfection to not offend with the
[35:36] tongue to not be quick to bite back he's
[35:38] say let us live Above This know that the
[35:41] world is going to hate you but don't
[35:43] hate back know that they're going to
[35:45] persecute you but don't persecute
[35:49] back when brother bradam said bride
[35:51] won't persecute bride it was it was the
[35:53] easiest saying because bride won't
[35:56] persecute any
[35:57] body because it's not it's not inner to
[36:00] do
[36:01] so so Christ does not ask us to fight
[36:04] fire with fire on and he will not allow
[36:08] us to justify our hate because of
[36:11] another's
[36:16] hate it's a broad caution if I could put
[36:20] it that way against the the evils of
[36:25] hate or if it helps you a little bit an
[36:29] evil
[36:30] hate there is a wicked hatred that is
[36:33] not of
[36:34] God brother bam said he let there be
[36:36] hate that he might be
[36:38] love it has to be there has to be hate
[36:41] because of
[36:44] love and there is a hate that is not a
[36:46] compliment to love right but a
[36:51] contradiction there's something sinister
[36:54] about this hatred I've already
[36:56] acknowledged if If any man come to me
[36:57] and hate not his father that there's
[36:58] there's got to be some semblance of it
[37:01] that there's something there's something
[37:02] there about an aversion to something and
[37:04] we'll get to it here in just a moment I
[37:06] so I'm just kind of maybe foreshadowing
[37:08] a little bit we know that there's some
[37:09] aversion that we will'll have that we'll
[37:11] have these strong negative impulses
[37:13] towards something it God is it's not
[37:16] suggesting that we ought to be like
[37:19] murder lest I hate
[37:22] that it's it's we want to be mature
[37:25] about this
[37:27] there's there is something sinister
[37:29] about hatred there's a hatred that we
[37:31] must be aware of to guard
[37:33] against in Hebrews 12:14 Paul says
[37:36] follow peace with all
[37:39] men and Holiness without which no man
[37:42] shall see the Lord this is quite a
[37:45] statement when he says follow peace with
[37:47] all men it means cultivate a good
[37:49] understanding of
[37:51] others don't just except be ignorant
[37:54] they hated Christ because they did not
[37:56] understand understand him they became
[37:58] enemies to Christ because they disagreed
[38:00] with him so when Paul says follow peace
[38:02] with all men it means cultivate an
[38:04] understanding of other people get to
[38:06] know what another person's going through
[38:09] if if you if they act in a way that's
[38:10] offensive they do something that that
[38:12] would cause you to begin to hate stop
[38:14] for a moment take a deep breath and try
[38:16] to understand them better cultivate a
[38:20] cultivate a good understanding of others
[38:23] with to be without prejudice right to be
[38:26] with without
[38:27] Envy when Paul says follow peace with
[38:30] all men he he does he does not qualify
[38:33] it like we we're not seeking to be
[38:36] enemies don't indulge the passions that
[38:39] lead to
[38:40] Strife follow peace means eagerly pursue
[38:43] after it give attention to it give
[38:45] diligence to it don't always be quick to
[38:48] be
[38:50] adversarial there there you know
[38:53] there's I'll say this there this is uh
[38:58] confession time forgive me congregation
[39:00] it's been so many weeks since my last
[39:03] confession these are my not my sins but
[39:06] these are my weaknesses we're MC's we're
[39:09] contrarians if you told me that was an
[39:11] electric vehicle I'd say well actually
[39:12] it's a battery powered vehicle right you
[39:15] just can't accept that it's an electric
[39:17] vehicle right you got to get you got to
[39:18] dis get really precise and disagree well
[39:21] no actually it's not a blue
[39:23] hue and and just you can't ever accept
[39:26] something for what it
[39:27] is and that sometimes we just have that
[39:30] nature where we're just
[39:31] contrarians well I think this well
[39:34] that's
[39:35] ridiculous you know I really like that
[39:37] well you do that's
[39:39] crazy and there's just you can't ever be
[39:41] at peace with
[39:43] anybody and this is what he's saying
[39:45] follow peace with all men don't be so
[39:48] quick to disagree don't be so quick to
[39:50] complain don't be so quick to be
[39:51] negative but maybe seek to understand
[39:54] and explore maybe you need to learn what
[39:55] electricity
[39:59] is follow peace with all men because
[40:02] there is a enity there's a hatred
[40:04] there's an
[40:05] animosity that we could have that is not
[40:08] of
[40:09] God I want to read several verses in
[40:11] Romans chapter 12 verses 9 to 21 I'll
[40:14] read verse 9 and I'll I'll just draw
[40:17] from a few other places real quick and
[40:18] we'll pick back up in verse 10 do an
[40:21] excellent on time
[40:24] today Ros his a open it's available
[40:28] don't get Negative don't
[40:30] hate Romans 12:9 let love be without dis
[40:34] dissimulation we know that means
[40:37] hypocrisy and in order to not have a
[40:39] hypocritical love he says abhor that
[40:40] which is evil cleave to that which is
[40:42] good to have a strong intense hate that
[40:46] which is
[40:47] evil and so if our love is going to be
[40:50] correct if it's going to be sincere if
[40:51] it's going to be without hypocrisy you
[40:53] have to know that which is evil and you
[40:55] have to have an verion to it you have to
[40:57] know that which is good and you need to
[40:59] cling to it and so Paul is saying that
[41:01] there must be some hatred to that which
[41:03] is evil now we' have this I okay I get
[41:07] that some a strong aversion to a
[41:09] passionate aversion extreme ill will
[41:11] towards that which is evil we must have
[41:14] that in order for our love to not be
[41:16] hypocritical we cannot say that we uh
[41:18] love God and also love the
[41:22] world when he says this this is not an
[41:25] admonition or an admonishment to
[41:28] anger this is not encouragement to wrath
[41:32] this is not being able to say well
[41:36] that's wrong so I hate them I I maybe
[41:39] I'm going to get myself in trouble but I
[41:41] I find it so heartbreaking when people
[41:45] identify sin and then Express such
[41:48] venomous hatred towards someone to to
[41:52] express hatred for somebody who gets an
[41:54] abortion hatred for somebody who who is
[41:56] gay and he get such hatred that's not of
[42:00] Christ you've been drawn off sides
[42:03] there's things that are wrong there's
[42:05] things that are not pure there's things
[42:06] that are wicked but God hasn't ask you
[42:09] to become mean mean-spirited and hateful
[42:12] and be
[42:17] vengeful this is not our authorization
[42:19] to
[42:20] Rampage to protest to
[42:24] injure but yet we know that hate is a a
[42:29] consequence it says in Psalms 11914
[42:32] through the pre through thy precepts I
[42:34] get understanding therefore I hate every
[42:37] false
[42:38] way hatred of evil is a consequence of
[42:41] loving
[42:42] truth but sometimes people just excuse
[42:45] their
[42:46] hatred and they use truth as their
[42:49] excuse It's just hate it's just malice
[42:53] they just made someone their enemy
[42:55] they're not pouring that which is evil
[42:57] because they certainly haven't got even
[42:58] close to good they're just hating
[43:02] they're just resisting not submitting to
[43:04] the lord they're just say they're
[43:05] resisting evil they're just tearing down
[43:07] other kingdoms they're just they they've
[43:09] drawn the a sword against the wickedness
[43:12] in the world today but they're not
[43:13] clinging to
[43:16] Christ Revelations 2: 6 and also verse
[43:20] 15 it says but this thou Hast that thou
[43:22] hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I
[43:25] also hate
[43:26] in this great compliment to the church
[43:28] he's saying you hate something that I
[43:29] hate so there is a hatred there is a
[43:32] strong aversion there is some kind of
[43:34] repulsing to sin and these Deeds of the
[43:36] nians he says so hast thou hast thou
[43:39] also them that hold the doctrine nians
[43:41] which thing I hate so he affirms it
[43:44] again that God God has hatred he says
[43:47] Jacob I've love Esau I've hated there's
[43:49] could be some there's a there's a hatred
[43:52] that is a companion and a compliment to
[43:54] love but don't use that as an excuse to
[43:57] hate that which is against love to have
[44:01] that hate which is not pure there's a
[44:04] Godly hatred a hatred that is perfect
[44:07] that is pure that produces
[44:09] righteousness through thy precepts I get
[44:11] understanding as I've understood your
[44:13] nature of as understood your word I hate
[44:15] every false way as it says in Psalms
[44:18] 139: 21 and 22 do not I hate them oh
[44:22] Lord that hate thee and am I not grieved
[44:25] with those that rise up against thee I
[44:28] hate them with perfect
[44:30] hatred I count them mine
[44:33] enemies I know you might think man you
[44:35] were just building a house and now it's
[44:36] just become a house of cards in one
[44:39] scripture but there there is
[44:43] this
[44:44] acknowledgment that where there's an
[44:46] intense passion for Christ there will be
[44:50] a rejection of
[44:52] evil that where there is a through
[44:56] understanding by the word of God there's
[44:59] going to be a strong negative reaction
[45:03] response to evil to every false
[45:08] way he says I hate them with the perfect
[45:10] hatred I count them my enemies well if
[45:13] we could just say this daavid was being
[45:22] honest let thy love be without
[45:24] dissimulation abhor that which is good
[45:26] excuse me aord that which is evil cleave
[45:27] to that which is good verse 10 be kindly
[45:31] affectionate one to another with
[45:32] brotherly
[45:34] love in our abhorring evil we ought to
[45:36] never become so
[45:40] abhorent and always rejecting and always
[45:44] hating till we can't be kindly
[45:46] affectioned to one another in honor
[45:49] preferring one
[45:51] another not slothful in business fervent
[45:53] in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in
[45:55] hope patient in Tribulation continuing
[45:58] instant in prayer Distributing to the
[46:00] necessity of saints given to
[46:02] hospitality drawing now even for the
[46:04] very things that Christ taught bless
[46:06] them which persecute you bless and curse
[46:11] not to bless those that persecute you is
[46:14] to say that you're going to invoke a
[46:16] blessing upon
[46:17] them that you would actually pray for
[46:20] them and he says curse not to bless and
[46:23] curse not do not invoke evil upon on
[46:26] them do not speak of their doom and I
[46:30] know that's going to change our days
[46:32] completely like what are we going to do
[46:34] when we're driving home from work if we
[46:37] can't Doom everybody as we do so but
[46:40] it's just one of these things especially
[46:42] when something happens and I know I'm
[46:44] just speaking in a way that's very plain
[46:46] to us today but what is it kind of our
[46:48] knee-jerk reaction when we've had a
[46:50] negative interaction with somebody in in
[46:52] some sort of service setting or somebody
[46:54] does something to us we're like oh
[46:55] they're going to pay for it they have no
[46:57] idea who I am you know why I'm bride you
[47:01] get that your cars going to explode your
[47:04] your Tesla is going to
[47:05] explode you we all of a sudden start
[47:08] imagine all sorts of crazy things you're
[47:10] going to fall in a
[47:11] sinkhole right and we just think we're
[47:13] going to Doom them we've immediately
[47:15] begin to think to ourselves what kind of
[47:18] crazy horrible things are going to
[47:19] happen to them because they charged me
[47:22] gratuity
[47:24] immediately
[47:26] and and and that's kind of the attitude
[47:28] we get and God is cautioning the word is
[47:30] cautious against that kind of instinct
[47:31] of do you know who I am you treated me
[47:33] wrong you're going to get it but rather
[47:35] seek to bless
[47:37] someone and not just Doom them or
[47:39] condemn them bless them which pers
[47:43] persecute you bless and curse not
[47:46] rejoice with them that do rejoice and
[47:47] weep with them that weep be of the same
[47:50] mind toward mind one toward another mind
[47:54] not high things but but condescend to
[47:56] Men of low estate be not wise in your
[47:59] own
[48:00] conceits recompense to no man evil for
[48:05] evil if somebody's paid you in evil
[48:08] don't pay him back in
[48:10] evil got like when when some of these
[48:13] guys they get a judgment against them
[48:14] and they have a $10,000 judgment so they
[48:16] pay in pennies soaked in
[48:19] oil right they're they want to they want
[48:22] to get back they want revenge he's
[48:24] saying don't recompense evil for evil
[48:27] provide things honest in the sight of
[48:28] all men if it be possible and I love the
[48:32] grace with which Paul expresses this if
[48:34] it be possible as much as lith in you
[48:38] live peaceably with all
[48:40] men he acknowledges that there will be
[48:43] some situations where peace is not
[48:46] possible and therefore you're not to
[48:47] engage in Conflict but you're to
[48:49] disengage you don't want to to escalate
[48:52] you got to find a way to get out of it
[48:53] but he said as much as it's possible as
[48:55] much as you are able live peaceably with
[48:57] all men dearly beloved avenge not
[49:00] yourselves but rather give place under
[49:03] wrath for it there written vengeance is
[49:06] mine I love how Paul still kind of
[49:08] speaks to our human nature but I want
[49:10] him to get it and he say well just let
[49:12] it it'll come in time vengeance is mine
[49:14] I will repay sayith the Lord don't don't
[49:16] need to avenge yourselves don't get
[49:18] consumed with it don't get eaten up with
[49:20] it therefore if thine enemy hunger feed
[49:22] him if he thirst give him drink for do
[49:25] so Thou shalt Heap coals of fire on his
[49:27] head we don't need to be
[49:31] Avengers sorry Star Wars fans we do not
[49:34] need to be
[49:36] Avengers he says but be not overcome of
[49:40] evil but overcome evil with
[49:44] good when he says recompense to no man
[49:47] evil for evil and he just run through
[49:49] this list of things and acknowledges
[49:51] where there's hostility there there
[49:53] might be this tendency to engage and to
[49:55] respond and kind he says no is as much
[49:57] as possible live peacefully don't make
[49:59] people your enemies he says and if you
[50:01] feel like they need to have Justice
[50:02] rained out upon them you don't need to
[50:04] one be the one that do it God will look
[50:06] after you if they're hungry feed them if
[50:08] they're thirsty give them something to
[50:09] drink because in doing so it's just
[50:11] going to he more condemnation on because
[50:12] he says be not overcome of evil but
[50:16] overcome evil with good
[50:20] amen I hope in the next few Services we
[50:23] can look at hate in a way that helps us
[50:26] to overcome
[50:27] it maybe in the next few Services we'll
[50:30] look at the origin of hate where it
[50:33] begins even how it starts for
[50:36] us some of the things that kind of give
[50:38] rise to it the reasons why we hate and
[50:40] ultimately how to overcome
[50:42] it I going say this as I close I'll
[50:44] invite the musicians to
[50:46] come there
[50:48] are I was I I just feel to say this to
[50:51] kind of help maybe give something to
[50:52] hold on to before we
[50:54] go
[50:56] if I could even use the phrase there are
[50:59] isms that hide our hate right
[51:02] good
[51:04] beliefs because we believe a certain
[51:07] way and it hides our
[51:09] hate we have judgments and
[51:13] opinions that cover up our
[51:16] hatred I read a
[51:19] statement that was so remarkable to
[51:23] me and it was I don't believe it was the
[51:27] founder the history of the clux clan is
[51:30] you
[51:31] know the the second iteration of it in
[51:33] the 1900s when it became very very
[51:36] powerful and and it was sweeping
[51:39] politics gripping States I don't can't
[51:42] remember if it was the founder at that
[51:43] time of that movement or it was one of
[51:44] the grand dragons or whatever they call
[51:47] him who who said I didn't sell and it
[51:50] might have been the in Indiana I didn't
[51:53] sell them on hatred
[51:56] I sold them on
[51:59] americanism and there's a lot of isms
[52:02] we're sold
[52:04] on and it's actually
[52:06] hate it leads us to hate and they don't
[52:10] have to teach us to hate this person
[52:12] don't have to teach us to hate this and
[52:13] don't have to teach us to hate that they
[52:15] just have to sell us on an
[52:17] ism and it begins to take care of itself
[52:21] and I pray to God that we're not
[52:22] allowing ourselves to be gripped by any
[52:24] ism that's right that leads us to
[52:27] hate to where we don't realize it but
[52:30] slowly but surely something is eating us
[52:32] up oh no no no no this isn't hatred this
[52:35] isn't this isn't hatred but in reality
[52:37] it's exactly what it
[52:38] is and there's just been a little here
[52:41] that we've read to you today but I
[52:42] believe the word of God has given us a
[52:43] sharp
[52:44] warning about not being overcome with
[52:52] hate Romans chap 14: 19 let us there
[52:55] therefore follow after the
[52:58] things which make for
[53:01] peace and things wherewith one may edify
[53:10] another when those angels appeared to
[53:12] those Shepherds that
[53:14] night he said we're going to bring you
[53:17] news that'll
[53:19] produce intense
[53:22] gladness peace on Earth good toward
[53:27] men but yet Christ becomes this dividing
[53:32] character he sets a man at variance
[53:34] against his father against his family
[53:36] there's there's this in in this peace
[53:38] that is coming hatred Rises up against
[53:42] [Music]
[53:44] it and in the day and age that we're
[53:46] living in now I could say where is the
[53:49] Peace where is the Peace that Christ
[53:53] promised I read it over and over again
[53:56] that the gospel is rest and I find
[53:58] myself that's what I need more than ever
[54:01] is
[54:03] rest let us therefore follow after
[54:05] things that make for
[54:08] peace things which build up that
[54:10] strengthen and
[54:11] [Music]
[54:16] encourage I can't remember where I think
[54:18] it was a Psalm of Life that we quoted
[54:19] here recently and Henry wodsworth Long
[54:22] Fellow you can't just say his first and
[54:23] last name but you got to say all three
[54:26] but he wrote a poem called Christmas
[54:28] bells it's been turned into it became a
[54:31] Christmas carol turned into a
[54:34] song but he wrote this on Christmas
[54:37] Day
[54:39] 1863 if you can place yourself
[54:42] historically in that time period in the
[54:44] Civil War it's Christmas Day and he
[54:47] hears the bells of the Town Church
[54:50] playing and as he hears these bells he
[54:53] begins to write a song
[54:56] that how the bells are playing this
[54:58] familiar Carol and it's a sound it's
[55:00] heard and it's kind of the a tune that
[55:04] you would
[55:09] recognize but then he begins to write
[55:13] this then from each black a cursed mouth
[55:16] the cannon thundered in the
[55:18] South with the sound the carols drowned
[55:21] of peace on Earth Goodwill to
[55:24] men riding now in this Christmas day of
[55:26] how that here's the bells declaring
[55:28] peace but it's the it's the war it's the
[55:30] conflict it thunders
[55:33] out and it sound drowns out the sounds
[55:36] of the carol singing peace on Earth Good
[55:38] Will to
[55:39] men it was as if an earthquake rent the
[55:42] hearth stones of a continent and made
[55:45] for Lorn the households born of peace on
[55:48] Earth Goodwill to
[55:50] men the very ones that were rooted in
[55:52] this peace the very ones that believed
[55:54] in the gospel now they've been made for
[55:56] Lauren there's been a rending there's
[55:58] been a tearing in the light of this
[56:00] conflict that's divided a nation divided
[56:02] families divided sons and brothers he
[56:04] then in light of it says and in despair
[56:06] I bowed my head and this is what Henry
[56:09] Wadsworth Longfellow says there is no
[56:11] peace on Earth I
[56:13] said for hate is strong and mocks the
[56:17] song of peace on Earth goodwi to
[56:21] men what a what
[56:23] perception what contrast to Bell's
[56:26] ringing maybe in a a snow covered town
[56:29] and and all the trappings of Christmas
[56:31] but yet he recognizes he exists within a
[56:33] world that's torn apart and no matter
[56:35] how Charming he may have been able to
[56:37] make his home no matter how Charming The
[56:38] Village may have been he knew that not
[56:40] too far away War had met people's
[56:42] households War had come to cities
[56:44] doorsteps and states were being ruined
[56:46] and lives are being lost he says oh the
[56:48] belts are playing on Christmas day and
[56:50] it says peace on Earth and goodwi to men
[56:53] but he hangs his head in his own dispair
[56:55] says no there's no peace on Earth where
[56:58] is there peace on Earth because hate is
[57:02] strong and mo the song of peace on Earth
[57:04] Goodwill to
[57:06] men and it wasn't just the Civil War on
[57:10] the doorsteps of the virgins on the
[57:12] doorsteps of the pennsylvanians it
[57:14] wasn't just Those whom D had come to
[57:16] their very cities and towns but long
[57:18] fellow's oldest son Charles had joined
[57:21] the union without his father's
[57:23] blessing and had been severely wounded
[57:26] the month
[57:28] before and if that wasn't enough just
[57:30] before that Henry's wife had died in a
[57:32] tragic
[57:34] accident and here he with his wife
[57:36] recently deceased his son severely
[57:38] wounded because of this war maybe his
[57:41] son leaving without his Blessing maybe
[57:42] begging him to not be a part of it you
[57:44] find him just with the acrimony of war
[57:47] the hostility of the conflict maybe
[57:49] eating up the union eating up the South
[57:51] hatred and animosity on both sides and
[57:54] perhaps perhaps his own
[57:56] hate perhaps it's his own hate for
[57:58] what's happened to his family his wife
[58:01] did it was an accidental fire she
[58:03] dies and maybe with his grief and now
[58:06] his son is running off to war now he's
[58:07] severely wounded and as he sits there
[58:09] and he hangs his head in despair he's
[58:12] not wagging his his his finger at the
[58:16] South he's not just taking issue with
[58:18] the soldiers in the north he says it
[58:21] maybe with his own hate raging in his
[58:23] heart there is no peace on on
[58:25] Earth how can there be peace my son lays
[58:30] dying my wife dies tragically what is
[58:33] this world coming
[58:34] to as he says it I said there is no
[58:38] peace on Earth for hate is strong and
[58:41] mocks the song of peace on Earth Good
[58:43] Will to men but it does not end this
[58:46] poem there he says the bells don't
[58:50] stop in light of everything that's
[58:52] happened and everything that has been
[58:54] despite the death of the tragedy the
[58:56] Warfare and all the acrimony despite the
[58:59] strength of hatred that mocks the song
[59:02] The Bells don't
[59:04] quit he says then P the bells peeled the
[59:07] bells more loud and deep God is not dead
[59:11] nor does he sleep the wrong shall fail
[59:15] the right Prevail with peace on Earth
[59:18] Good Will to men I believe we can find
[59:21] peace in knowing that God made a promise
[59:23] and no matter how work it gets there is
[59:26] light for us there is peace for us no
[59:29] matter how hard the trials may get we
[59:31] can rest in Jesus Christ knowing there
[59:34] will be
[59:35] peace as he sat there that Christmas Day
[59:38] pitting this maybe that's what first
[59:40] struck him is the of the joy and
[59:43] the lightness of Christmas bells and out
[59:45] of his own loss and sorrow and he began
[59:48] to see this great contrast to the things
[59:50] that were in the world he says there is
[59:52] no there is no peace he hatred is way
[59:55] tooo strong hatred is one there's too
[59:58] much animosity there's too much
[59:59] bitterness hatred is one and as he began
[1:00:02] to yield to it and give himself into
[1:00:04] hatred and spess and anger and
[1:00:08] frustration and Vengeance the bells just
[1:00:11] kept on ringing and as it kept ringing
[1:00:13] he said no no God is not dead my
[1:00:17] Avengers is not dead and as long as he
[1:00:20] is alive the right shall win the right
[1:00:23] shall Prevail and the wrong will
[1:00:26] fail there will be peace on
[1:00:29] Earth Let There Be Good Will to
[1:00:33] men I challenge you to find the
[1:00:39] peace that you so desperately
[1:00:42] crave there's a lot of ways we describe
[1:00:45] it what we're searching for and what
[1:00:47] we're longing for and there's a lot of
[1:00:49] ways that we might talk about our
[1:00:50] present situation but a lot of times the
[1:00:52] very thing the very thing you're craving
[1:00:54] is
[1:00:55] peace there's only one way to find
[1:00:58] it and I hope that even by bringing up
[1:01:01] this Spectre Spectre of hatred you might
[1:01:02] find that it's hatred that's driving you
[1:01:05] from the very thing that can give you
[1:01:06] the peace you
[1:01:08] need stand with me today
