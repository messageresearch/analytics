TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Isaiah 45:18 for thus sayith the Lord that created the heavens God himself that formed the Earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited I am the lord and there is none else amen you can take your seats my title tonight is created to create and we're going to pick up there in Isaiah 45:18 here in a moment uh but my title to is created to create and I'd like to bring uh this statement back to your remembrance that we read on Sunday from Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Ram's speaking of the man who formed the the artificial tooth the artificial limb and how their scientists and there's creators and there's those that use substance that's been given to them and even using the design that God has already laid out in his creation and they make something artificial or replacement he says the man that made an artificial arm made reputation for himself but the man who made the real arm made of himself no reputation and it's this statement that I think is so remarkable the Way Up Is Down and remember that be humble be sweet and kind be creative let Christ be in you and this is said kind of amplifying on let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus who humbled himself didn't make himself of any reputation and and humbled himself to the form of man and in making himself in the form of man was obedient uh unto the death of the Cross brother brandom places Us in that same let this mind be in you and he says let Christ be in you so there must be a humility there must be a sweetness there must be a kindness and then this statement that seems to be maybe a little bit out of place uh since it's not something that he says anywhere else in terms of a command to be creative but he says be creative that's that's having the quality of creating being able to have that function or that skill to create something and that's what I'm looking at when we say created to create this he says to be creative that means we must have this function this capacity this ability of creating and exploring this concept or this act of creating I want to look at the creation once again in the beginning and in Isaiah chapter 45: 18 it says for thus sayith the Lord that created the heavens and so here is in the beginning God created we see this being uh rehearsed here in Isaiah 45 he created the heavens God himself that formed the Earth and made it he hath established it that's is God creating all things there's only one Creator created the heavens he formed the Earth he made it he brought it forth he's established it he created it not in vain that word there in the Hebrew vain it's the same word that was without form or void it's that chaos or that confusion but he formed it to be inhabited he he he he formed it that it would remain even that word means remain and that's another clue that this Earth though it's going to be renovated and it's going to be called a new Heaven A New Earth it is an attribute of God that he created to Forever remain it's going to be inhabited I am the lord and there is none else in verse 12 it says I made Heavens I made I have made the Earth and created man upon it I even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have I Comm commanded again this is in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth I've made the earth I created man upon it even my hands have stretched out the heavens this is God's handiwork this is the act of God bringing forth something that wasn't before it's in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth uh the the Latin is uh out of nothing came something the ex nilo it's out of nothing came something he shaped he formed he fashioned didn't use any existing substance and he brought something forth and on Sunday we were looking at the the phrase the art of God and that God uh made the Heaven and the Earth that's his handiwork that's his artwork he created mankind uh that that was his handiwork he he wrote the Bible in the heavens and then he brings it forth by inspiration all these things are an expression of God the Creator even you yourself are an example of God's creative work maybe his ultimate one that he was always moving towards so in Genesis 1: 27 we're we're just going to be looking at this statement this scripture tonight in Greater detail so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them this is God WR painting a self-portrait and God working something out of nothing using substance uh uh by the spoken word and then as he would make the body he would use the dust of the Earth but this is God creating man in his own image So Adam reflected God and in reflecting God he this creation reflect reflected the Creator more than any other creation God as a Creator is reflecting himself out in creation whether he's creating the smallest thing or to the highest thing but when he creates man this is the highest uh expression of his creation and so for Adam I know this is going to be very very Elementary just very very simple but for Adam to be in God's image it's necessary that Adam was created to create again like I said it's just really simple you're going to say you know you how long did you spend putting this together because this is I could have done this and it's probably true but it it sometimes it just Bears repeating things very simply that Adam being made in the image of God it was necessary that God was creating him to create and what is that he commands him to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion that's a language that describes at least in some way a form of creating a form of fashioning a form of bringing forth and I was thinking of it this way this week that when God made man in his own image he was making him to be a God on Earth and he made him to be a Creator giving him this commandment to be fruitful to multiply replenish the Earth subdue it have dominion these this is a language of commissioning him and commanding him and so in some ways God was commissioning Adam as an artist and when an artwork is commissioned there's this intimate process of one collaborating with an artist uh to bring something for us so God having been the creator of everything commissions Adam to work alongside him to intimately work together collaborating in beautifying the world and then Genesis CH 2: 19 20 and I'm realizing now there's a little bit maybe of a hole in here in the s that I took some things out I was wanting to go into some details where he said let there be light and this function of light and if you want to listen to there's a man here who could turn on the light some of those Shalom sermons or the power of transformation brother bam identifies just how important light is in terms of having life and so I want to skip that portion in Genesis and come to verse 19 in Chapter 2 and this is again zeroing in on the man who is created in God's image we could say as an amateur Creator which we know even we are and there's certain abilities and things that he would have had and it says out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air now this is clearly a creative act this is something that God has brought forth himself but now Adam being a partner with him in this it says and he brought them this would be the formed Beast and the formed foul brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them notice there's something even in God's observation of Adam where I'm going to bring these things which I have created and I want to see what you will name him I want to know what you come up with what your instinct is and it says and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof now could you imagine this is this is probably really good question that if you had a baby you just let somebody else name the baby just every start panicking hyperventilating I've heard that that's what Trump was wants to do I don't know if it's true or not but my people say that it's no that it would be one of the scariest things I guess for a parent that brings forth something or you create a work of art and someone says I'm going to name that for you or you I guess for as a minister if somebody else was naming my sermons I'd get very picky about it used to drive me crazy at one church I attended and you'd spend all month coming up with a really good title and they would just say you know sermon by Aaron or whatever you could tell it's probably family and uh so there's something to the naming of a thing something very important and God is entrusting Adam with the naming of creation whatever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof so God didn't test Adam in the sense well what do you think this name is and he's like camel and he's like no elephant no it wasn't a game he said whatever you name him that's what it is and it says and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the foul of the air and to every beast of the field and then it gives kind of like this uh sad um tag to it but for Adam there was not found an help meat for him and we know that that foreshadows the bringing forth of the woman we'll come to it here in a moment but this is I want you to think of what task that Adam had in naming God's creation Adam didn't himself create Adam did not have uh the commission to bring forth life uh in the original of as God did form these things of the field and every foul of the air and not sure maybe what Adam would have been doing in this process uh and to what extent God was relying upon him but it's very clear that the word of God says that God brought to him these create Creations for him to name and this is not a small thing he's commissioning you Adam I want commissioning Adam I want you to name my creation and in order for him to name these things it would have required Adam to consider very diligently what God had created he would have been having to pay attention wasn't just drawing names out of a had it wasn't just uh uh you know willy-nilly and whatever would come but he'd have to concentrate he'd have to contemplate God's creation he would look at it in a way that God as this is the way that I see it in terms of the way that the Bible describes it he brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them it's there was some contemplation that he wanted Adam to engage in he was going to look at it he was going to examine it he was going to consider that which was before him and what struck me is that as God would bring this an these animals before Adam and as he would give his attention to God's creation and he would look over it he would concentrate and he would contemplate the beauty of God's creation he gained knowledge from observing God's creation and it quickened something to Adam in order to name God's creation in other words he got a a revelation from the very thing that God had created and it inspired the naming of it the Bible says Adam gave names it was a recognition of the difference of things that in giving a name it separated out as its own entity it required this reason it required some silent contemplation and I I found myself reading this one writer who had wrote a book she wrote a book called Gathering moss and I think she's done some TED Talks I haven't watched those or uh leaned in too much to those other things but right in this book on Gathering moss and how there's over 22,000 different variations of moss and how that they are only usually known by their Latin name and their scientific name and they don't have common names that we might have for other trees and and other flowers and different things and in this writing she's looking at how the power of naming is a very intimate mode of knowing in other words there's different modes of knowledge or different ways of knowing things and so uh she's setting forth that naming is a special discourse that manifests something that's unknown and that that to me is very thought-provoking that when you name something it it's it's disclosing something that otherwise was not broadcast or made known he's not asking Adam I'm going to test you and give you a pop quiz to see whether or not you remember what I called these but he was going to speak and in speaking he was disclosing something that had not been known befor amen so naming was this act of naming by Adam it was a uh it was being creative in the image of God Amen something that God the original Creator was trusting Adam to do and to name something required just as the spoken word brought everything into existence in order for Adam to name the animals he had to speak it required a word to come forth and in in being steered into this direction I felt that it just fits so well with with what brother Ellie eer ministered on last Tuesday night the last midweek service of last year on good morning bride and how God uh is even changing a language not just church but bride because brother B says your name Associates what you are and brother Ellie eer read this it has an impression on your character so the name is not just an appalation that we might be able to put you in different categories but there's some imprinting there's some fashioning there's some making that comes with the naming so even by Adam naming the animals he's imparting to them some sort of impression or character or activity or work or use or utility this uh Miss kimmerer who wrote this book on Gathering MOS she said the name on lips reveals the knowledge we have of each other hence the sweet secret names we have for the ones we love the names we give ourselves are a powerful form of self-determination of declaring ourselves Sovereign territory isn't that what they say the sweetest sound anyone can hear is their own name and it's it she says further it is a sign of respect to call a being by its name and a sign of disrespect to ignore it words and names are the ways we as humans build relationships think of how important it is to have a name and how that we can use this power of names in order to Grant to others characteristics that we would want to solely them or to cast them in a bad light and that's exactly how we know that we could assassinate somebody or murder somebody by speaking against their character because we try to use words to impress upon their character to form them and shape and that's why we've got to be careful brother my says what you name your children and there's there's something to this name is it would Associates what you are your name Associates what you are it impresses upon your character Adam was making an impression he was associating a certain nature and character to these animals and this act of naming it it confers dignity upon the person by by receiving a name it not only differentiates you and shows that you're different and you're distinct from everyone else and so in a sense it highlights your differences but in doing so it makes you part of the community because now you've received a name you have some sort of identity I feel that the uh the tener of this service does not uh give itself to me reading the entire poem but uh one that would make some sense to read or you might enjoy some of you is TS Elliot's the naming of cats and if you've never read it you should read it I think it perfectly describes cats and uh if anyone wants a copy of it I'll give you one first person to ask me at the end of service can have a copy of the naming of cats now Adam when he's creating he did not create like God but it was a a creative work of speaking the truth and and giving identity and it was something that God had entrusted him with as a part of creation now as the Bible said just a moment ago as we read that there was none found for Adam to be a help meet we know that God says I will make him a help me he brings forth the woman and in verse 23 it says and Adam said this is now bone of my bones the Bible's telling us that and I realize now I may have cut this verse out where God brings forth a woman and takes her brings her to the man and he makes an introduction so now God shows Adam the woman and he says this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man Adam is instinctively um offering up uh praise I want to say that it was praise it was this adulation where he says this this is bone of my bones this is Flesh of My Flesh Adam knowing that he had been commissioned that he had a part in creation that he had the power to name uh when he sees the woman he doesn't regard her as anything less he sees her as co-equal bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and he names her she shall be called woman now this is uh how simple the sermon is tonight that even right now I've come to the main thesis that I want to express and I want you to see in this activity whereas when God was bringing the animal like before Adam he saw the beauty of God's handiwork and in contemplating it and processing it and looking at it and this attention that he was giving the handiwork of God it inspired the name that was given to that animal life and here God uses and I want to say true beauty that there's a truth here it's not we got to be careful which direction you might want to take with this but I believe it highlights the dangers that we see in this a day and age God uses true beauty of the purpose of Attraction and this Revelation where when God brought Adam and I want to show you this in the message of the hour when God brought the woman before him there was something about her that so excited him that he was effusive in his praise he was agile and say bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she's going to be called woman and he names her and say well I thought she was named Eve that's what title she's given after the fall but here she is called she's named just as he did the animals he gives her this name woman and God was using Beauty to attract Adam he was using his creation to inspire to give Revelation to Adam and this is I would say one reason why the devil works so hard to pervert Beauty and how easily beauty is misused because we know that even according to the message of hour there is a beauty that is the devil always it's always the devil when it's in a certain channel in his writings uh BL Pascal he wrote The Art of persuasion so there's another art and he had made a statement he he made this this statement he said all men are almost led to believe not of proof but by attraction I think of that almost all men are led to believe something accept something that is agreeable to them they agree with it because it's beautiful because it's Pleasant to the Eyes by attraction but not by proof and in there is quite a paradox because we accept God on the basis of faith not proof there's something very fascinating to ponder on this two sides that he says there's a kind of standard of agreeableness in one translation said attractiveness there's a kind of standard of attract attractiveness and Beauty which consists in a certain relation between our natural dispositions whether it be feeble or strong and that which gives us pleasure this is maybe a fancy way of describing some people like Southern Gospel and some people like contemporary gospel some people are into this some people are into that some people like Ros some people don't this is just a way of saying that there's always some standard of beauty or attractiveness that we lend ourselves to whatever conforms to this standard pleases he says be it a residence music discourse poetry Pros females Birds Rivers trees Chambers dress maybe some archaic language in there but whether it be a house whether it be music whether it be convers ation or poetry or or or the other sex Birds Rivers trees Chambers some people love the beach some people love the mountains says whatever is aligns or conforms with that standard it pleases them but whatever is not adopted to this model displeases those who have a susceptibility of taste so then in this we all have some sort of incl inclination towards something and a preference for something now we're not going to debate where that comes from nature nurture rather whether it's organic but in the fact that mankind is made even to where they are today to where they can almost be led to believe without proof and to accept something on the basis of attraction that if I'm attracted to it if it's agreeable if it's pleasing it's something in my disposition that I I want to have I want to accept I want to believe based upon attraction not some sort of sterile proof and because it is this way within man there's some Design Within man that could be manipulated that can be twisted there's a way that this thirst can actually be perverted that degrades him now there's I read that just so you I read it so you could see that there is even in a base sense because even Pascal when he's writing says not I I I'm not saying that this is true with the things of God he said because those things that relate to God ought to be accepted upon the basis that they're God's word uh whether unpleasant or Pleasant that there's a certain sphere in which we accept God on the basis of word and we live in a fallen time and and darkness all around us and there's so much debate and clamor and so much noise to where it obscures the word of God and the true beauty of God's word and so that Satan has been working very hard to twist and to distort and to pervert but with this Instinct that's in man there's something originally in Adam that God inspires when he brings the woman to him she shall be called woman this was a an a creative act inspired by the beauty of his wife and God used this uh this wand that he brought forth out of Adam if I could even say God's handiwork his art too inspired the creative act of Adam there was something in Adam God used the animals to bring it out there was something in Adam and it was actually this woman and when he brings her forth this skill this desire this longing it it was expressed in Adam the speaking forth this broadcasting this praise was brought out from him when he saw this woman who came from him now I have several statements I'd like to read to you this evening on this very subject I I have there was many that I left out but we've we've already we're on we're already in the second half of the sermon and so in the sermon fellowship with God through reconciliation he said let's turn our camera for the closing moments that's interesting even phrasing we're going to turn turn our camera we're going to focus on something out let's go back to Eden again I can see little Eve see little Eve standing there I was standing not long ago went off to uh a Mars Hill down there in Athens and I was watching a picture there that some Grecian artist had painted of the creation I've been searching for hours trying to find where these things might be uh brother brandom in another place when he's telling this I might have it here he says he was in Rome so if he was in Greece I'm having a hard time maybe finding the the Greek artists artists that may have done it maybe more of a modern portrait not a classic one but here he describes it we showed those on Sunday how there's some uh even the in the classics that show this ugliness of the woman he said it was an ettt to Christianity there stood Eve the horriblest looking Beast you ever seen I never seen such a person as Eve and there was Adam with hairs out of his nose way out like that and looked like some kind of prehistoric giant that's what made me think of the one where he had that kind of that really long mustache he says not such a thing as that anybody would do that has got a diluted mind a perverted mind they're if they're going to portray Adam and the woman as some sort of ugly creation he said this artists they don't know God Eve was the most beautiful woman that was ever on the earth she was God's perfect thought of a woman and Adam was the most perfect man that lived and in many of these instances he's described them even as they're ushered out of the garden in their expulsion as some of the artists described it and they were cast out of the garden he says I can see Adam great big manly shoulders his big muscles in his legs his shaggy hair hanging down around his neck I can see Eve beautiful her blonde hair hanging down her back and her eyes as blue as the sky and sparkled like the Stars this is where we get our pickup lines right guys it's your dad a thief she didn't have the use of any Max Factor to make her pretty no sir sin is what did that but look brother she's made in God's image she's made after an image of man after God had created her beautiful never to die never to get old never to wrinkle the sparkle to never go out of her eyes she was to be beautiful forever now there's a lot of emphasis sometimes on the this peculiar place that the woman is uh is before God in man and we look at her in her Fallen condition and where we tried to build her up and raise her up is in looking at what God wants to use her for in the end time but just look at the picture that God originally brought forth if we change our camera view if we look at God's original creation she was beautiful never get old the sparkle in her eyes some one place I don't think I have it in these quotes here he says her teeth would never get yellow they would always remain white there was something he's describing he says I see him standing there this is in conferences Adam with his big manly body that was a very picture of Health when I was in Greece here not long ago I seen a picture of some unconverted mind a great artist who had painted a picture of Adam and Eve it was a discredit to humanity So Not only was it a discredit to Christianity now it's even a discredit to Humanity talk about a harsh artart critic brother bram's really putting this guy in his place he says Eve looked like an animal instead of a lady great hair hanging one side and her mouth setting sideways and one leg bigger than the other one and oh she looked horrible that's what the conception of the unconverted mind again there's something he's tapping into where there's some purity of mind there's some uh some thought that will that is the mind having been converted because there is even as I mentioned on Sunday and just wanting to share a picture that great es of the ctin chapel a cathedral a church you have to you have to be very creative how you display it otherwise there's going to be showing the the the nude body and there was a time when that even within the medieval times and art and things that that was considered pure and notice how God would take the the devil will take something World take something and he perverts it and so what would portray innocence and what would be beautiful the unconverted mind now begins to describe put portray In This Very ugliness he says Eve was the most beautiful woman that ever walked on the face of the Earth he made her her eyes were like the stars in the heavens again there's many more statements in this line and and and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies he says and when he seen Eve standing there now notice how this begins to narrow down specifically onto Adam when he saw Eve standing there the beautiful little woman that real masculine man standing there those big bronny muscles and the blood running off his arms from that Old bloody sheep skins little Eve standing there the most beautiful woman ever was in the world because she was created by God's own hand her eyes were like the stars of the heaven this is not just a one-off brother br's describing it over and over speaking of the man and the woman who says they were perfect beautiful wonderful and there they stood what did God bring forth Something Beautiful what he made he made it beautiful the Bible even says in Ecclesiastes he makes all things beautiful in his time in the beginning when God created he brought it forth in a beautiful way in the sermon preparation he said about the woman she was lovely when Adam woke up that morning and see there that beautiful woman flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones he took her by the arm and walked down through Eden what a beautiful home no sickness no sorrow no nothing to live together forever now this woman that came forth from Adam's own side God separating out the female Spirit making a lady giving her a body as a woman something complimentary to Adam when he sees her he says oh she's so beautiful and he takes her by the hand in the sermon law he says back in the Garden of Eden a picture here before you just a moment noce he says I want to give this picture again what one thing he says I want to show you a bring this camera but a picture here before you look at God's Little Children Adam and Eve running around in the garden lovely no sickness no heartaches nothing to harm or destroy never to get old when Adam woke up that morning when God taken from his side the rib and made a woman I know the Grecian artist and different artists of the world paint the picture of Eve a horrible looking beast that's wrong only common everyday knowledge would let you know different from that no one admired anyone that looks like that now catch what he's picking up on here he's saying that if you painted the woman in such a light that she was horrific looking and ugly he said that controverts just Human Experience he said everyday knowledge would tell you that that's not to be admired that that wouldn't be beautiful and he said though they might look like that and can't help it he said not anyone no one admired anyone that looks like that and he says that they though they might look like that and can't help it they feel sorry for them so he said nobody would admire someone that looks that way and if they do he says you feel sorry for them he's just being honest he says but I believe that Eve was the most beautiful woman that God ever put on the earth I can see her sitting there her eyes is blue as the skies above Sparkle her long hair hanging down her back the most perfect looking woman ever was on the earth there she is God give Adam the best that he could and there and there's other places where he's describing her how beautiful she is and her body and her eyes and her hair and her teeth and everything about her would just be beautiful he said to try to portray the woman of something ugly and horrific looking he says that everyday knowledge would tell you that's not so that there would been no Beauty in her that would have been desirable so he says this in when he's given his life story he says I believe that when God woke Adam up to look at Eve she was the most beautiful thing that eyes had ever looked at it goes to show that man Even This Day the desire in men craves to look at a beautiful woman this is Brother Brown I think being pretty plain that there's some desire in him and there's some crave to look at a beautiful woman he says why because that strain comes down through that time like that to know that that was given Plum from the Garden of Eden so God brought forth a very beautiful woman and he brings her to the man and when Adam sees her something is inspired inside of him something is excited inside there's this declaration you're bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh you shall be called he goes to name he enters into this creative act and names her woman and brother Braham said that that that that woman when she was brought it says to this day this desire this crave is a strain that came in in the Garden of Eden in the sermon cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our lives it's the full title he says I believe Eve was the most beautiful woman that was ever on the earth that's right when Adam looked at her and he he goes he he he says it's just why it goes to show that strain comes right on down through human beings today if it didn't it would be vice versa now there I think that gives some some room for you just to think about what he's saying that that strain as in Adam was put in Adam was in Adam it was brought out by this beautiful woman and brother Bram says it still effects he says it still and he says the effects of it still lingers through the sons of Adam down through here that admire her and another place he says it goes to show that strain comes right on down through the human beings today now I'm looking at this in its original sense and its original Purity and the way that God had intended it to be for a reason and for a purpose that God had made them for a reason and he made her beautiful for a reason and this is the quote that I I have used most often in this respect he said it shows the very strain that Eve was the most beautiful thing that ever was said on the earth that's right she didn't need any Max Factor to fix herself up she had it from God that beautiful teeth would never turn yellow or fall out I see her sitting there and her hair hanging down there her back and her eyes as bright as the stars of heaven and when Adam looked at her it put such a shock that still lives in mankind you realize this there was something about what the Adam saw that provoked something in him it it triggered something in Adam there was something in the way that God had made him something in his makeup something in his DNA something in spiritual characteristics that God wanted to provoke in him originally and purely that when Adam saw it it shocked him it put a strain he says this strain now lives in mankind today if I can say this it's the strain that the devil tries to pervert but there's a true beauty in it now if I could just interject this now uh just so I could maybe try to make this a little bit longer than 45 minutes notice how the Catholic Church tries to work within the framework of natural beauty and ornate things and this great big display and show of wealth it's because it's trying to capitalize on the truth that God used Beauty to portray himself and that beauty is something that God desires and that God loves and God created himself but then there's a perversion of it and this original beauty that God had given the woman was used for the purpose of Attraction the sermon the basis of Fellowship brother man says what makes a man long to have Fellowship can we just focus for a few minutes it's 8:02 not going to be very much longer you kind of have to read into this what makes a man long to have Fellowship what makes us come together and want to fellowship with one another it's because that there has to be some kind of strain from that he's talking about attraction he's talking about shock spark now I get I was some time ago in a great museum where there was a Greek artist that had painted a picture of Adam and Eve I never seen such a hideous looking sight in my life as that Eve looked like what Eve looked like in Adam well now if Eve looked like that hair sticking out like this and the jaw setting sideways and one arm this way and the other one that way and one limb about big around and the other one like that oh it was awful looking brutal looking thing well if that was the way Eve looked when Adam woke up and seen her that would be the desire of man to be his wife today to look like that it was a strain now that's right now we know better than that now God doesn't make anything unless it's perfect it's right it's good it's precious perfect something that is inh parent in creation was this goodness of God this beauty of God he doesn't make anything unless it's good and precious and perfect he says and that's what I think that Eve was the most beautiful woman that ever was on the face of the Earth he says I longed to see her in Adam come walking down the paradise paradises of God together just to see what our mother of the earth looked like she was a beautiful person no doubt and Adam was a very species of a man masculine in every way Eve feminist in every way do you realize how brother bradam is describing this that if the woman had not been beautiful then it would it would show today what man would lift up and what he would desire but this very desire that man has towards his wife today it be it was expressed and shown in this beautiful woman that God brought before Adam and Adam in naming her portrayed an Act of Creation bone of his B flesh of his flesh Adam was created to create in Adam we see a prefigure of Christ and the woman we see a prefigure of the bride and in Psalms 90:1 17 I'll just close here the next few moments and let the beauty it says let the beauty of the Lord Our God be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us y the work of our hands is establish thou it God who said that he created the world by The Works of his hands in creating he made the Earth he created man upon it my hands have stretched out the heavens the one that created the heavens and formed the Earth and made it and established it he did not create in vain but he formed it to be inhabited this same God who created beauty from nothing it's now this expression says and let the beauty of the Lord Our God be upon us what is it that we learn in the Masterpiece that God is making another Masterpiece another Masterpiece is in the making God once again is bringing forth something to create it means that uh to create something is to bring it forth it means to bring into being one of the earlier uh meanings to make grow and so God in the beginning he created and now in this end time and then when he creates it to bring forth man he says you be fruit for multiply and replenish Earth you have a part to play in this creator act there's going to be this naming there's going to be this impression and now in this end time God is doing what another Masterpiece in the making to do what to reflect his Beauty and to perform his creative acts am because to C to to be creative is to bring forth what is it we're bringing forth the very beauty of Christ in Psalms 102:18 this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord we must as individuals bring forth Christ if you are new creatures in Christ created in Christ Jesus if if you have the spirit of God in you then the spirit that raised Christ from the D dead dwells in you then you have the very power and the force of creation we could say it in many ways and say well you've got if you've got God in you you've got power to create another world and live on it we've emphasized this from different directions but I want to kind of put in the Simplicity of the channel of human life that you and your life are to bring forth and create the very beauty of God you created to create and it's you upon whom the beauty of the Lord will be upon and upon you that he will establish the work of your hands and the work of your hands be established by God do so Lord that your beauty would be seen and in being seen it would be attractive it's so important that we Faithfully create Christ in this hour because God uses Beauty and the power of attraction to attract who not not the ones that maybe want who want the perversion but those who are hungry who are looking who can be caught by the attractiveness and then begin to pay attention to it am and then begin to consider it and contemplate it that they too might hear their name amen I'll close with this statement Brothers you can come to your instruments this statement to me I think says it very well in the sermon is question and answers and brother br's being asked question should you dye your hair should you do this and he's dealing with a lot of things that pertain to Holiness he says I'm so thankful for our group of women that we have coming here I say this with respect and love now God knows this is the truth I used to have a preacher friend down south that had one of the cleanest looking Churches I'd ever seen where you come to women the most beautiful women I'd ever seen there saintly Godly with long hair and I always admired going to that church and the Lord Jesus has given me a church today here that outshines that one 100 miles and so he he says that because it's right in the middle of him really laying down some principles of Holiness principles of beauty it's a way that a woman should Adorn herself says I'm not scolding you to be mean I'm only so happy for you I don't want Satan to get a foot in anywhere I want you to move upward not backward don't ever let a man deceive You by some enchantments or something another like that or something saying oh well it don't that's the way Satan interpreted the word to Eve you believe just what the word says there's enchantments in this hour where Satan wants to pervert what true beauty is and think of it it's getting so wild and so perverted the things that would be called beautiful and and Mankind is just so uh untethered and unmowed that there's a natural physical physical Beauty there's things in the world that are just merely enchantments and he he says I'm not trying to scold you but I'm want I'm wanting you I'm happy for you don't let the S the devil move in any one of these things you're to go upward don't be deceived by some enchantments who says well it doesn't matter this or that however he's trying to describe it he said the way that Satan interpreted the word to Eve and what did Satan do he used even her ability to create he used her ability CU brother bam said in there is where man made his fall in his power to create the woman deceived into thinking that something was beautiful Pleasant to the eyes what he had been separated from it had been separated from truth there's a certain goodness that God brings forth in his creation and that from that goodness uh it produces this great Beauty and then from that beauty comes obedience to truth and it's only through that we you can try to divorce uh and maybe maybe there might be a pun in there intended but there's a you can try to separate out truth from Beauty and that's not beautiful that's perverted that's the perverted Beauty so we don't want Satan interpreting the word to us in this hour we have to believe what the word says because you have been created in this hour by the word of God and brought forth by his word in order to create so many things in the message of the hour that you can begin to attach to this and say yep that's right brother M said we're amateur creators we can create an atmosphere power of God inside me brother bam even coming to the power of the third pole and he says Jesus multiplied creation but now in this hour he testifies that he spoke and something came to be where nothing was well that stumbles a lot of people but we were created to create that's why he says be creative because we have some responsibility to Pro tray as an artist as a canvas to bring forth Christ in this hour not in a broke painting not in a Renaissance not in some image of some day gone by where people would just look at you and think oh are you headed to a a Medieval Festival is it a renaissance fair or or or what character in World of Warcraft is that but no there's a life that we have got to live something that we portray that to one who has an eye will see and thirst for Christ I'd like for you to stand with me and pray today just bow our heads [Music] together with our heads bowed let's let's all offer a prayer to the Lord and put ourselves in this place in the word of God today there's a lot of practical things that we could admonish ourselves on the power of language it having such an incredible ability and power that in in what it conveys and communicates and the impression and naming has that's why we got to be so careful with how we use our tongue the creative power of the [Music] tongue and I let me express it this way our heads are bowed now we're just going to go to prayer but God used the beauty of the woman to inspire Adam and it was to inspire Adam to work together with her to be fruitful to multiply and replenish the Earth to subdue and have dominion and God today will use the beauty of his word wants to use the beauty of Christ that living bread of life to bring you forth and then in turn and bringing us forth we are to Bear we are to shine let the beauty of the Lord let that be our prayer let the beauty of the Lord be upon us we've emphasized a lot last year David desired to see the beauty of the Lord Moses craved and desired to see the beauty of the Lord Lord let your beauty be upon us Let Us Praise you with this act of Praise just like Adam did to declare your truth to declare your righteousness let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight though it may be a little brisk and chilly outside it's just gotten a little warm here in your house and there's a weariness to our flesh even in starting the year there's maybe a war of attrition for some and just how exhausting the holidays can be and there's sicknesses and there's the devil fighting many different channels so Lord you still desire to speak your word you still desire for us to hear your voice and I pray Lord that the beauty of your light could shine tonight into hearts that it could pass through any weariness any complexes any builtup resentment whatever force it may be that's resisting the word of God may your light just push aside every cloud of Doubt fear and worry every uh complex Lord just push it aside for a moment that we can receive what our request is that the beauty your beauty Lord may it be upon us Lord it is you used Beauty in the very beginning when you looked at your creation and you said it was very good that pleasantness that beauty that symmetry in your creation it's the most beautiful thing there's ever been Adam as a witness to each beautiful creature was inspired by its individual particular Beauty and use and utility and nature and he named it and he saw that it was fit for certain things Lord you even called Adam to be a tiller of the ground he was to be a a landscape artist he was to cultivate to nurture the soil and bring the good out of it get Beauty out of it and Lord that day when you brought the woman before him and he saw her it was such an immediate inspiration and Revelation that a name came forth he said she's woman I name her I call her woman Lord I believe that you're still using Beauty today it's the beauty of your word it's the beauty of Christ though to the world there was no Beauty in him that we would desire him there's still something attractive there's still something that is an attraction in this hour I pray Lord that you would help us as the members of your body as the people that has been created Lord may we learn to praise may we learn to worship may we learn to live and to broadcast and to share this gospel in the accurate light Lord that it might cause others to come forth Lord not a repulsive demonstration as these Greek artists rendered Adam and the woman in such a way that was horrible and filthy but Lord may we capture the true essence of Beauty in our lives that would cause others to be thirsty to long for you Lord I know they'll always be critics but there's ones who are victims of the critics that need to hear and see a real life we'll never be able to convince Satan we'll never be able to convince those who've hardened their hearts and are the tool of the devil but perhaps Lord there's others who have just been found in the chaos of leod DEA and you want light to shine this beauty to shine out of Zion that the Gentile could see your light and come to know you bless us I pray tonight as we close this service as we're soon dismissed thank you for your presence that's been with us tonight I thank you for these believers they so attentive father so uh uh diligent to absorb these words so I pray that you reward them for that Lord the sincerity is to your word and to you not to me not to this church their obedience and their hungers connected with their the Revelation they have of you in this hour not a tradition of a church service a midweek service a a car Charisma of a pastor lord it's genuine it's sincere reward them I pray I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
